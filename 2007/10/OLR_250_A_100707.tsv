0	20360	Tonight, October 7th, 2007, Bungie and Microsoft file for divorce, World of Warcraft celebrates
20360	29760	alcohol, and Nintendo gives something away to all Wii owners.
29760	35920	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35920	40320	We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,
40320	42320	and the gamer lifestyle.
42320	44480	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
44480	47740	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
47740	50080	I'm starting Octoberfest early.
50080	51080	Are you?
51080	52080	Yes I am, with British ale.
52080	53080	Enjoy.
53080	54080	What are you drinking tonight?
54080	55080	Newcastle.
55080	56080	Yummy.
56080	57080	Best ever.
57080	59400	Also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.
59400	62520	I'm drinking watered down Coke from McDonald's.
62520	65280	You sure don't have a party.
65280	67400	I'm very disappointed in your Germanness.
67400	70000	Their fries sucked.
70000	74360	And also say hello, joining us tonight, this somebody has not been on our program in a
74360	76420	damn long time, but he's here tonight.
76420	79480	Say hello to Black Lab, aka Puppy.
79480	81920	I made it out of Davis alive, thank God.
81920	86420	Yes, he used to be our correspondent for the People's Republic of Davis, which if you live
86420	90720	where our show is taped, Sacramento, you understand why that joke is funny, but if you're an international
90720	94120	or national listener, you have no clue what we're talking about, but just trust us, it's
94120	95120	funny.
95120	96800	But you're free from the perils of Davis now.
96800	97800	Yes I am.
97800	98800	And you're living on your own.
98800	99800	Yes, actually, I am.
99800	101520	They've let you out of the prisoner camp.
101520	103880	Rule number one of living on your own, make sure the mic is real close to your mouth,
103880	104880	because they're not very sensitive.
104880	105880	Okay.
105880	107160	Just don't eat it.
107160	111340	So what have you been up to since you've been on the show last?
111340	112800	How long has it been?
112800	114040	It's been like at least a year now.
114040	115560	Aren't we in double digits?
115560	116560	I think so.
116560	117560	The first time he was here.
117560	121040	Well, Puppy, you used to work in an arcade, and that's one thing you used to kind of come
121040	123140	on the show and talk to us about.
123140	125040	What arcade did you use to work at a long time ago?
125040	126280	Castro Valley Golf Land.
126280	130640	And what kinds of big popular machines were there at Castro Valley Golf Land?
130640	134080	Oh, I think one of them dancing machines, I think.
134080	135080	Oh, the dance game?
135080	136480	Oh, they had Time Crisis 3.
136480	137480	That was pretty popular.
137480	139280	That all the dancing fools played?
139280	140600	Yeah, yeah.
140600	142400	I think I was one of them.
142400	143840	All right.
143840	147960	So would you say that the skills that you learned working at an arcade have helped you
147960	148960	in the real world?
148960	149960	No.
149960	150960	No.
150960	153440	You didn't learn anything there, huh?
153440	154440	Not a damn thing.
154440	156200	Except that I hate kids.
156200	158920	It was one step above flipping burgers, yes?
158920	159920	Yeah.
159920	160920	Or would you...
160920	164080	I still had to serve pizza on weekends for parties, but...
164080	169640	Or in retrospect, would you rather have been frying French fries incorrectly at McDonald's?
169640	173800	I would know how to fry something at McDonald's because I would actually understand the instrument.
173800	174800	Instructional videos.
174800	176920	Everyone is listening to my ass right now.
176920	177920	Yeah, Jamie just sat on the...
177920	180880	There was one time that people got pissed off at McDonald's because I was sitting in
180880	185240	the middle of the lobby with a chair that I had pulled out from a table and sitting
185240	188720	there talking because my friends were all talking and just sitting there and talking
188720	191800	or basically standing there and talking, and I got tired of standing there so I pulled
191800	196240	over a chair and sat down next to everybody, and then the manager comes over and he's like,
196240	198960	what the fuck is that chair doing in the middle of this lobby?
198960	202480	Meanwhile, I mean, it's like they're almost closed anyways and there's no one there.
202480	203480	Is that how they really talk?
203480	204840	What about a bunch of potty mouths?
204840	209520	Well, he was a stoner, so... an angry stoner, which is weird.
209520	210600	How do you have an angry stoner?
210600	211600	I know.
211600	212600	How do you get an angry stoner?
212600	213600	Easy.
213600	215000	You don't give him any pot, then he's an angry stoner.
215000	216000	Or what?
216000	217400	Don't give him Twinkies?
217400	218400	Or something like that.
218400	219400	Well, he's into McDonald's.
219400	220840	I mean, he can eat a bunch of shit.
220840	223840	I'd be angry there and not even have to work there.
223840	225680	My other friends used to work at McDonald's.
225680	230600	We, on the other hand, were part of another clique, the Round Table Gang.
230600	231840	The Round Table Gang?
231840	232840	No, not really.
232840	234560	Boy, that sounds threatening.
234560	236800	Hey, we're gonna pizza your face!
236800	237800	I don't know.
237800	240280	I got to operate a large knife.
240280	241280	No.
241280	244040	Really, no, I didn't go around going, hey, we're part of the Round Table Gang.
244040	246680	No, we worked at Round Table.
246680	248720	We're a commune of Round Table people.
248720	252240	Well, folks, you'll notice there's two empty chairs back here if you're watching on our
252240	254840	Operator 11 live webcam or our archive.
254840	256040	There's two empty chairs back here.
256040	260560	That's because Rice Princess and Casper the Gay, or whatever his name is, are joining
260560	265400	us tonight, but they're late because they're at Target doing, or, I'm sorry, as Casper
265400	269240	might say, Tar-jay, getting Lord knows what at Target.
269240	273440	So they're not, hopefully a table, a real table for Loki, we'll see.
273440	274440	But they're not here.
274440	276860	I don't need a table because there would be no room for a table in here.
276860	277860	But they'll be here.
277860	278860	But who needs them?
278860	279860	Because we have the chat.
279860	280860	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
280860	281860	We love our chatters.
281860	283520	Thank you guys so much for joining us.
283520	287640	And let me just start off by saying, if you're listening tonight, this is episode number
287640	290740	250 of Orange Lounge Radio, if you can believe it.
290740	291740	That's quite a landmark.
291740	292740	That's the beer.
292740	295240	And in fact, all of you guys who are listening, congratulations.
295240	297360	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.
297360	298360	Oops.
298360	299360	No, not that.
299360	302680	I don't have to be an edit.
302680	305400	I started drinking a little early tonight.
305400	309000	And for those of you guys who are listening live, congratulations.
309000	310300	You just unlocked an achievement.
310300	312840	You just survived 250 episodes of this crap.
312840	315640	So you get 100 points and your game was scored.
315640	316640	Congratulations.
316640	321600	All right, let's get into our gaming week and start it off with Dark Soccer.
321600	322600	How was your gaming week?
322600	323600	I'm eating popcorn.
323600	324600	Just get me.
324600	325600	All right, then Logie.
325600	326600	Come back to me.
326600	327600	All right.
327600	328600	God, you're needy tonight.
328600	329600	All right.
329600	332000	I'm going to go sit in the chairs, because I feel bad that the OP11 people are looking
332000	333000	at nothing.
333000	334000	So I'll sit in the chairs.
334000	335000	I'm looking at my laptop, apparently.
335000	336000	All right.
336000	337000	Hey, Pete.
337000	338000	All right.
338000	340200	So this week, I played a shit ton of Ragnarok.
340200	343600	And I'm not talking about my regular, you know, butt load.
343600	345460	I'm talking about a shit ton of Ragnarok.
345460	346660	So it's like a shit ton.
346660	347660	Is that like metric?
347660	348660	It's metric.
348660	355720	Or if I was going to go with the Don French description, it would be croc shit, sir Ragnarok.
355720	358920	Or like shit kilo, you know.
358920	362920	So I have been, I decided to start a new class.
362920	364140	I started it last night.
364140	366840	It's called the Taekwon Girl.
366840	371360	And you don't get weapons, you just kick things in the face.
371360	372440	You just kick them in the face.
372440	374000	Can we get a live demonstration?
374000	375000	Puppy, lie down.
375000	376000	No.
376000	379400	I don't think so.
379400	383080	And then I started the character last night, and I'm playing today.
383080	388620	Got her up to a star gladiator, which was actually kind of a really weird game earlier.
388620	393600	So I now have her at level 70.
393600	395960	And I started her yesterday.
395960	396960	Last night.
396960	398520	Go pirate servers.
398520	399520	Awesome job.
399520	400520	All right.
400520	403320	And I don't have to work tomorrow, so I'm going to play more games tomorrow.
403320	404320	Good job.
404320	405320	Well, sounds good.
405320	407400	Well, let's keep right on moving along.
407400	408600	Loki, how was your gaming week?
408600	410200	My gaming week was fun.
410200	413200	I've been continuing playing Halo on Legendary.
413200	419600	I finally got past the part that I was stuck because I realized, hey, I can go backtrack
419600	421160	and there's a ton of weapons back there.
421160	422160	Holy shit.
422160	423400	Forgot all about that stuff.
423400	426080	And so you can play with the AI because they won't go past a certain part.
426080	431180	They'll chase after you and stuff and be like, ha, I'm in the save zone or some shit.
431180	433900	You can't attack me and they'll run back.
433900	434900	It's funny.
434900	435900	The AI is kind of dumb.
435900	437960	Have you done the confetti head thing?
437960	438960	No.
438960	442480	I'm playing through just by myself.
442480	446980	Dark Soccer's husband showed me the head shot confetti thing.
446980	448480	That is hilarious.
448480	452920	It makes, like you shoot off the thing and it makes this little, I think we have the
452920	455160	exact same noise in our audio library.
455160	458860	It has these little kids cheering when you do it.
458860	460120	I'm looking for the, keep going.
460120	462120	I'll imitate them anyways.
462120	468960	So other stuff I've been playing, I actually bought, what was it, Flat Out Ultimate Carnage.
468960	470700	That game is fucking awesome.
470700	473720	It's just lots of driving, crashing into things.
473720	480040	I played the Ragdoll Olympics stuff for quite a while, so I was launching my character through
480040	485720	windshields and flinging him down a ski slope, stuff like that.
485720	487000	Real fun game though.
487000	492800	And see other stuff I've been playing, actually, you know, I think that's about it.
492800	497320	I'm kind of working a little bit through the Jackass PSP game still.
497320	501440	And then, I don't know, I meant to get more games this week, but I didn't get around to
501440	502440	it.
502440	504360	So, maybe next week, you know.
504360	509400	And then I also meant to play the Simpsons demo because I downloaded it on my PS3.
509400	512920	But I didn't get a chance to play it because my wife wanted to watch Food Network instead.
512920	513920	So.
513920	515920	Food Network is great.
515920	517360	Awesome.
517360	518680	So is that it for your gaming week?
518680	519680	That is it.
519680	520680	All right.
520680	521680	Puppy!
521680	523240	Since you're here tonight, have you been playing any video games this week?
523240	524240	If so, what?
524240	525240	And how's it going?
525240	529200	I actually have been playing games about, I didn't have any systems until about a month
529200	533200	ago and then I finally caved and bought a 360.
533200	536800	And I've just been playing Halo for the last week and a half.
536800	540320	You need to come to our house and play Halo 3 with us.
540320	542520	I might try to do that.
542520	543920	And how is Halo going?
543920	546000	Are you a big fan of the Halo?
546000	548120	Yeah, I am.
548120	549800	Sadly.
549800	555720	I'm still confused by some things in the plot and other than that, I just shoot things.
555720	557840	And I like the little grunt head explosions.
557840	559880	Yes, I found the sound effects.
559880	561600	So when you shoot them in the head, you get this.
561600	563680	It makes that little sound effect.
563680	566100	And a little confetti blows up everywhere.
566100	567100	It's awesome.
567100	570280	It's fun when you turn up the explosions on that too so that when you shoot one in the
570280	573600	head, all the ones around them go off too and explode.
573600	576640	Time was going around punching people in the head with the skull.
576640	579860	That was pretty cool.
579860	581280	So that's it for your gaming week?
581280	582280	Yeah, pretty much.
582280	587920	I was playing WoW for a while, but ever since Halo 3 came out, I pretty much stopped.
587920	592380	Well finally joining us, they're a little bit late tonight, so you guys are so fired,
592380	593380	but they're here in studio.
593380	596760	Say hello to Rice Princess and what are we calling you now, Casper?
596760	599760	Casper the gang.
599760	600760	He's Eddie to me.
600760	602880	He'll always be Eddie.
602880	604080	So Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?
604080	607080	What have you been playing?
607080	608080	Wow.
608080	611120	Does it ever change really?
611120	612120	That's pretty much it.
612120	613400	Hey, you have my sweater.
613400	614400	I'm so glad.
614400	615840	Yes, you left your sweater here.
615840	617920	My Alliance sweater.
617920	621320	What's hilarious is that the only way we knew who it belonged to is that we saw that it
621320	626800	was an Alliance sweatshirt that you left here and we were like, who the fuck plays Alliance?
626800	627800	Only cool people do.
627800	629120	And we were like, oh, it must be Rice Princess.
629120	630120	Bleh.
630120	631120	Whatever.
631120	632120	Please take this thing out of my house.
632120	633120	I will.
633120	634120	She's an Alliance character, at least she's sort of evil.
634120	638080	The only reason worth playing Alliance is for the Jurnai, but it gets old.
638080	639080	Whatever.
639080	640080	Whatever.
640080	641080	And if you want to play with 12 year olds.
641080	642080	You can play a warlock.
642080	643560	And if you want to play a cool side.
643560	645160	You can play warlocks on Horde's side.
645160	646160	They're much cooler.
646160	647160	Warlocks are much better.
647160	648160	Because undead are horse.
648160	649160	Warlocks are lame.
649160	650160	You're lame.
650160	651160	Anyway, anything else you want to add?
651160	654160	Before we turn into the wow cast, is there anything else you want to share for your gaming
654160	655160	week?
655160	656160	No.
656160	657160	All right.
657160	658160	Then Casper, how was your gaming week?
658160	659160	It was awesome.
659160	661680	I got Phantom Hourglass, new Zelda game for DS.
661680	662680	It was really good.
662680	663680	You like it?
663680	664680	Yeah, it's really good.
664680	668680	Finally, they get to not make you fumble between the D-pad and the buttons and the stylus all
668680	669840	at the same time.
669840	671520	It's all stylus and it's very smooth.
671520	675320	It's a very cool control style.
675320	678120	So tell me a little more about it, because I'm contemplating if I want to buy it or not.
678120	680660	So how does it play compared to the other Zeldas?
680660	682160	Is it more Wind Waker?
682160	684200	Is it more Super Nintendo Zelda?
684200	685420	It's a direct sequel to Wind Waker.
685420	688840	It takes place right after the end of Wind Waker.
688840	689840	Same style.
689840	690840	It's like that cel shading.
690840	693680	It's pretty good for the DS, but it still looks pretty good.
693680	695720	Just really cool control style.
695720	699960	You basically slash with the stylus on the screen or you tap things to attack them, all
699960	701840	that kind of stuff.
701840	706000	There's a map screen that you write on, write little notes and stuff, which I thought would
706000	708160	be kind of gimmicky at first, but it actually works out.
708160	711960	Some of the puzzles are centered around making notes and things like that, so it's pretty
711960	712960	cool.
712960	713960	Good times.
713960	716560	So on a scale of 1 to 10, but you're a Zelda fan boy.
716560	717960	I'm a Zelda fan boy.
717960	721240	I'm not a huge fan of Wind Waker, but it's still good.
721240	725520	You know, I'm hoping that Ganon's in there somewhere, but I haven't gotten that far yet.
725520	729120	And GS68 in our chat room is screaming, no spoilers.
729120	730120	So please don't.
730120	731120	I'm not that far, so I really can't spoil anything.
731120	734680	I don't use the no spoilers until Aris gets it, so go ahead and spoil.
734680	735680	I don't care.
735680	736680	Let her die!
736680	738680	Yeah, Link dies at the end.
738680	739680	Ah!
739680	740680	All right.
740680	745020	Anyhow, my gaming week, I've also been playing World of Warcraft.
745020	747280	I got to level 68, so I have a flying mount now.
747280	752520	Or I am a flying mount, because I play a druid, so I get a free flying mount.
752520	756480	Or if it's not free, it costs me eight gold.
756480	759420	And I ran instances.
759420	763280	As a guild, we ran underbog and slave pens.
763280	768480	And that's how I leveled.
768480	772280	I feel like this week's episode of the Sarah Silverman program, all of a sudden, where
772280	774280	they were playing D&D for 24 hours straight.
774280	775280	Anyway.
775280	776280	I've done that.
776280	779360	You're the hardcorest of the nerds.
779360	781960	You're queen of the nerd people.
781960	782960	She's just a princess.
782960	784720	You're the queen.
784720	785720	Let's see.
785720	788000	So also my gaming week, I played Tetris Splash.
788000	792560	I actually bought the new Tetris Splash, which was the Xbox Live arcade game of the week.
792560	793720	And Tetris Splash is okay.
793720	798680	I mean, it's Tetris, and it has its competitive mode, which plays really smoothly on Xbox
798680	800160	Live, I've got to say.
800160	803680	And seems like the audience of people playing the game, not a lot of jerks, which is good.
803680	804680	You get some pretty good people.
804680	806360	Some people who are really skilled at Tetris.
806360	810160	I got my butt whooped in a ranked match by some people who are really good at Tetris,
810160	811160	and I'm not so competitive.
811160	812160	Tetris is fun.
812160	813160	They have that on DS.
813160	814160	And it was like, it's crazy.
814160	815160	I'm like, Tetris.
815160	816160	Oh, but it's fun.
816160	820160	Here's why Tetris Splash pissed me off, though, is it just made the fact that I actually bought
820160	823000	Tetris Evolution even more salt in the wound.
823000	828040	Because that game was like 30 bucks on Xbox 360, and then it releases a $10 version.
828040	829360	I'm so mad.
829360	830520	Like why did they do that?
830520	831520	Why?
831520	833480	They didn't even wait like six months.
833480	836280	Tetris Evolution came out like three months ago.
836280	840640	And now we have an even slightly, I don't know if you'd say better version.
840640	842200	I think it is kind of a better version.
842200	843200	It doesn't have the HD videos.
843200	844960	It has that stupid aquarium.
844960	848120	It looks like a screensaver from After Dark.
848120	853400	But here's the thing that pissed me off about that is, have you heard about the microtransactions
853400	854400	with this?
854400	855400	No.
855400	862280	The day they released Tetris Splash on Xbox Live Arcade.
862280	865960	They released 15 different download packs for Tetris Splash.
865960	866960	What?
866960	868120	No, maybe it's like 11.
868120	869960	But it's more than 10.
869960	876880	Between 80 and 150 points per download, and you know what these things are?
876880	882960	They're just new fish for your tank, or new tanks to put the fish in.
882960	886800	Now let me ask you, do you play Tetris to stare at the background?
886800	887840	No.
887840	893120	So what's the point of downloading fish and fish tanks?
893120	895520	Then don't buy it.
895520	897160	There's a sucker born every second.
897160	898160	How about this?
898160	901100	It's either that or they could have made the game more expensive and threw them in there
901100	904600	for free, which I think would have been a better move to make the money.
904600	909240	I think a better move would have been what they were starting to do, which is you unlock
909240	913560	more fish as you unlock more achievements or you get lines in the game.
913560	915680	You and your logic and your critical thinking.
915680	919040	I mean, heaven forbid, I could not believe that.
919040	921360	If you buy this stuff, you're a sucker.
921360	923280	You're an absolute sucker.
923280	930800	When you buy this stuff, I got some Guitar Hero download packs for you.
930800	932920	I love Tetris, which is why this makes me mad.
932920	937080	I feel like Tetris on the 360 is like fucked beyond belief between this whole evolution
937080	940020	and now microtransaction fish tank thing.
940020	943160	By the way, Rob, I hate the word microtransaction.
943160	944160	Well that's what it is.
944160	946240	A microtransaction is a transaction no matter how big or small.
946240	951240	Well that's what they call it, but why don't you write a letter to EA and all those people.
951240	954080	I have the same problem with pre-boarding because you're not really pre-boarding, you're
954080	955080	just boarding.
955080	956080	Early.
956080	959880	Why you got to derail my segment, huh?
959880	963400	Well technically a microtransaction is an accurate description.
963400	966680	It's a transaction that is small, hence micro.
966680	970320	If it were a Jolly Rancher for five cents, would that be a microtransaction?
970320	971320	This is a sucker.
971320	973680	Yes, it would be a microtransaction.
973680	974960	What defines micro or macro?
974960	978360	This is a suck transaction because if you buy this, you suck.
978360	980600	If I buy a computer, is it a macrotransaction?
980600	982320	If you support this, you suck.
982320	986280	A macrotransaction would be, for example, let's say Oblivion.
986280	989400	When you buy the retail copy of Oblivion, that would be a macrotransaction.
989400	995480	When you buy add-on content that is cheaper than the purchase of the game, that is a microtransaction.
995480	997520	I would think that buying the system would be the macrotransaction.
997520	1000720	I cannot believe we're having an argument.
1000720	1002400	Would be a neutral transaction.
1002400	1003840	And 2.
1003840	1004840	Fight!
1004840	1006760	It was a neutral transaction, then.
1006760	1008880	This is the Semantics webcast.
1008880	1010960	Let me be exchanged.
1010960	1016840	GS68 in our chatroom says, buying a PS3 equals a macrotransaction.
1016840	1021080	That's like a super macro suck transaction.
1021080	1022080	Alright.
1022080	1024120	Sorry, ring the bell.
1024120	1025120	It's a major transaction.
1025120	1028240	Sorry, I made a little dig on the PS3.
1028240	1030080	Alright, so that's everybody's gaming week.
1030080	1031080	Yes, we've hit everybody.
1031080	1032080	Alright.
1032080	1036680	Let's get into housekeeping tonight, and of course tonight is episode number 250.
1036680	1037680	Yay.
1037680	1038680	Yay!
1038680	1042440	We didn't do anything special tonight, really, except have a lot of guests here, because
1042440	1047720	we don't want to celebrate ourselves more than once in a year, because that's just,
1047720	1049240	I don't know, that's too much ego.
1049240	1053200	Like once a year is acceptable, and we did that with our five-year anniversary show,
1053200	1056800	but if we were to kind of like promote, hey, it's episode 250, everybody should congratulate
1056800	1057800	us again.
1057800	1061420	That's like celebrating your anniversaries with your spouse or something every month
1061420	1062420	or something.
1062420	1063420	It's like our 13-month anniversary.
1063420	1064420	Yeah, awesome.
1064420	1065420	Exactly.
1065420	1066420	That's what it is.
1066420	1069320	After a while, it's just like, eh, whatever.
1069320	1073280	So yeah, this is just an eh, whatever episode of Orange Island Radio, but we do have some
1073280	1074840	special stuff tonight.
1074840	1079360	We actually have Insanist is one of our correspondents in Seattle.
1079360	1082840	He's actually, since he lives in Seattle, he's at the World Cyber Games this weekend,
1082840	1086040	and he actually called us a little earlier today to say this.
1086040	1088040	Hello, Orange Island Radio.
1088040	1093480	This is Insanist reporting live from Seattle, Washington here Sunday, October 7th, 2007.
1093480	1099400	I'm calling to let you know that you missed out on some extraordinary goings on here at
1099400	1100400	the World Cyber Games.
1100400	1104320	For those of you not familiar, the Olympics of video games.
1104320	1111200	There were people from 74 countries, 700 gamers playing 12 different games, ranging from Command
1111200	1117120	and Conquer 3 all the way to a huge favorite, StarCraft.
1117120	1123280	Lots of huge upsets, which my partner and kind of DJ Tyrant will get to you later about.
1123280	1127640	I'm telling you that this is something you don't ever want to miss.
1127640	1132960	It's a one of a kind event, meeting people from all sorts of countries at the press events,
1132960	1135960	at press tournaments, everything.
1135960	1143880	I actually, probably the funniest thing at any sort of tournament or competition I tried
1143880	1151720	to enter, I lost to somebody from another country every single time.
1151720	1157480	But just being able to take in all the cultural aspects, but just being here as one, all as
1157480	1161680	gamers, just having a good time was great.
1161680	1166320	Seeing people play, rock bands from different countries, and yes, I did hear somebody from
1166320	1173480	China try to sing Black Hole Sun, and it was kind of funny, but that's very mean, but it
1173480	1176240	was a great, great event.
1176240	1180840	The next one is in Cologne, Germany, so any new European listeners to Orange on Radio,
1180840	1182920	I recommend you take the trip out and go.
1182920	1187560	DJ Tyrant and I are actually thinking about going, so maybe we'll see you there.
1187560	1192860	But more, excuse me, I'm walking about downtown Seattle as I do this.
1192860	1197760	But for Orange on Radio, I'm insane as, to hear more about this, listen to our show The
1197760	1205000	Insanist Hour featuring SDFU every Thursday at 7.30 Pacific time, until then, I'm Insanist,
1205000	1206000	take care.
1206000	1210320	Thank you very much Insanist for your little report there from the World Cyber Games, he
1210320	1213640	was raving about it, like he was calling me literally every day about something that was
1213640	1217140	going on, he called me the other day, he's like, hey Rob, I got to play one of the other
1217140	1224000	all-game shows in some press competition, and I beat him, and I was like, go, you sound
1224000	1225000	like you're having a lot of fun.
1225000	1231640	One of the games was ChromeHounds because I think it was Madden, so I was, I don't think
1231640	1234280	he was actually playing all games interactive, I think he was playing one of the other shows
1234280	1236920	there, I want to say it was Game Addict Hotline.
1236920	1244420	Really the real losers of ChromeHounds would be anyone that bought the game, unfortunately.
1244420	1248440	Now Loki, if I heard you right during the tape segment there, you were dissing World
1248440	1250120	Cyber Games a little bit, what's your issue?
1250120	1251120	I think it's stupid.
1251120	1252120	Why?
1252120	1255680	I mean it's cool that I guess a bunch of people come together, but don't refer to it as like
1255680	1261640	the fucking Olympics or anything like that, I mean, seriously, to me the World Cyber Games
1261640	1265600	kind of reminds me of like the professional gaming leagues and shit like that, I fucking
1265600	1270800	hate those, I really do, that's like trying to launch the fucking XFL, I mean it's retarded,
1270800	1275520	no one's going to want to watch you play games, don't broadcast it, it's boring.
1275520	1278280	The XFL was actually kind of fun.
1278280	1282520	It's kind of weird because I know in like, I guess it's Korea, they have professional
1282520	1289840	gamers that make a lot of money for the spectator, but you're saying that it's not a spectator
1289840	1294600	type of deal, but it kind of is, it just depends on what region you're in.
1294600	1299920	If you've ever watched that stupid show that was on G4 a while back, Arena, it was the
1299920	1301120	most boring thing to watch.
1301120	1305120	Well the problem was the way they put it together, they picked up kids off the street and tried
1305120	1307360	to make it all like, rad.
1307360	1311480	Well the problem is I think they really need to, if they're going to do something like
1311480	1316000	this, any design games that are meant for this type of gameplay or anything like that,
1316000	1320840	like Unreal Tournament or something, where you could actually set it up like, film it
1320840	1327920	like you're doing an actual football or sporting event type of game, just something like that.
1327920	1332960	Because flipping between people's screens and watching people do stuff, no one really
1332960	1335360	cares and it's kind of dumb.
1335360	1339600	I mean I guess it's cool if you're there at a DDR tournament or something like that, if
1339600	1343800	you're there and participating and watching, that's cool, but as far as broadcasting it
1343800	1346560	around the world, I don't think anyone cares.
1346560	1351880	It's kind of sort of like how people like to watch football and stuff, actually being
1351880	1355360	in the bleachers and watching the game as opposed to watching it on TV.
1355360	1357960	Well even on TV though, at least, it's sort of interesting.
1357960	1361560	If you watch it on TV you can turn it off.
1361560	1367360	It doesn't take much to go, oh look at me, I'm fast at the reflexes, who cares, it doesn't
1367360	1368760	take much to really build yourself up.
1368760	1371680	I know a lot of people that are fascinated with watching people play video games.
1371680	1375080	Yeah, we've all got that friend that's like, hey you want to play, no I'll just watch.
1375080	1378640	It's like, oh okay, and they're like having a good time watching you, like Rice Princess,
1378640	1382240	she's like, I'm going to watch you.
1382240	1384760	That's like my roommate, he doesn't really play video games, but he's always kind of
1384760	1387040	like, hey aren't you going to play Eternal Sonata again?
1387040	1390560	I kind of want to know what happens.
1390560	1392760	Why did you quit at Chapter 5?
1392760	1396960	I like doing cooperative gaming, not like where both of you are actually playing the
1396960	1402280	game, but like what Dan and I used to do, where he would, when we played Resident Evil,
1402280	1406600	he would play through the game and I would go off the strategy guide or tell him where
1406600	1407600	to go.
1407600	1408600	Aw, bonding time.
1408600	1409600	That's all storyline stuff.
1409600	1412240	You want to know what happens in the storyline and stuff like that.
1412240	1415000	That's a little different than saying, oh I want to watch you because you're so lead
1415000	1416000	at fucking Halo.
1416000	1417000	You know what I mean?
1417000	1418960	I don't, that's a little different.
1418960	1423560	It's not like, I was watching Halo for the storyline, but then it stopped making sense.
1423560	1424960	I mean seriously, it's different.
1424960	1426960	Is there even a storyline?
1426960	1430720	You're tuning in for like the story and not for the actual gameplay.
1430720	1434720	I don't know why Halo 3 bothered with the story for real because I was playing co-op
1434720	1438200	mode the other day and like, you know, we're walking through and what have you and we're
1438200	1439440	shooting aliens, we're having a fun time.
1439440	1441200	I'll tell you what, Halo 3 co-op mode is awesome.
1441200	1445720	We're going through it and then suddenly Cortana's like, find me, you gotta find, I'm like, bitch,
1445720	1447720	get off the screen!
1447720	1453640	Wow, you got like so straight for a second there, that was like scary.
1453640	1457280	And here's the funny thing about that, Rob, since I haven't played any of the other games,
1457280	1460200	I don't understand the significance of finding her in the first place.
1460200	1463120	I'm like, it's just a fucking computer, just let it go, come on, seriously.
1463120	1465040	I thought she got exploded.
1465040	1467640	Buy a new chick, I mean seriously.
1467640	1469520	I don't know.
1469520	1474360	See I lost a little something for not playing the other games, but I digress.
1474360	1479360	So anyway, wow, really quickly though, people, what about the calls where people are like,
1479360	1482480	I want to see DDR in the Olympics or that whole thing.
1482480	1483480	No!
1483480	1484480	You are stupid!
1484480	1485480	Wait, hold on, hold on.
1485480	1486480	Oh my god.
1486480	1488600	What about this as an outlet for those people that want to see that?
1488600	1492240	I mean, there are people that want to do gaming as a competitive sport and, you know, people
1492240	1496280	that feel that, you know, why should gaming be any different from other sports that are
1496280	1497280	outdoors?
1497280	1500800	You know what, if you want to have gaming as a competitive sport, just do PVP mode on
1500800	1501800	Ragnarok.
1501800	1502800	End of story.
1502800	1510560	Congratulations everybody, DarkSakura has leveled down the show, good job.
1510560	1511560	Heart.
1511560	1513560	Chat time.
1513560	1514560	Yes.
1514560	1516560	Oh, I got the finger.
1516560	1521240	Why don't you put that finger up so the Op11 people can see it on the cam, there you go.
1521240	1522240	Alright.
1522240	1524960	Going to the chat room, because god, we haven't been paying attention to chat, I'm so sorry
1524960	1525960	folks.
1525960	1526960	Chat.orangewater.com.
1526960	1527960	Macmanbabykicker.
1527960	1528960	I don't know, why would you kick babykicker?
1528960	1534840	Okay, Shane.
1534840	1539760	Macman says, Cortana is significantly less hot in Halo 3, so therefore she doesn't deserve
1539760	1540760	to be saved, apparently.
1540760	1542760	She wasn't hot in the first Halo.
1542760	1544400	She's not real.
1544400	1546920	DDRDollarBill says, no DDR in the Olympics.
1546920	1547920	I found that ironic.
1547920	1551360	If she was a real chick or something, it might make more sense that you're trying to save
1551360	1553720	her, but she's a fucking computer program.
1553720	1554720	TigerClaws.
1554720	1556720	Make a copy.
1556720	1559680	Hey, don't copy that floppy.
1559680	1564520	TigerClaws says, video games are becoming a spectator sport.
1564520	1568120	Son of Dad says, didn't they broadcast some of the fighting game championships recently
1568120	1569120	in Japan?
1569120	1570120	See, that's Japan.
1570120	1574240	They put weird shit on their TV, and you know what though, I respect them for that, because
1574240	1576040	there's some cool shit on there.
1576040	1582280	If only they'd fucking fill G4 full of all that cool shit in Japan, might be willing
1582280	1583600	to watch that channel.
1583600	1586400	They try, but they ban.
1586400	1587400	So yeah.
1587400	1588400	I mean, okay.
1588400	1589400	DarkShy brings up a good point.
1589400	1590400	Yes, please.
1590400	1591400	I've seen King of Kong.
1591400	1592400	It's very interesting.
1592400	1597520	Yeah, DarkShy says they have a movie, they had a movie called King of Kong, by the way.
1597520	1600840	It was about the, it was Twin Galaxies.
1600840	1602840	Oh, they're bullshit.
1602840	1603840	Right.
1603840	1609720	And the guy, there was another guy who had completely trashed the guy that they put on
1609720	1613720	Twin Galaxies score, and it was a big drama.
1613720	1616480	Actually, I would suggest to everybody, watch through King of Kong.
1616480	1619720	Well, see now, that's a good example, because people got really into that, and people, now
1619720	1623080	I haven't seen the movie yet, but from what I've heard, people really get into it, and
1623080	1625600	they're like rooting for one guy over the other guy.
1625600	1629400	You know, that's, what about that for your whole argument where people don't want to...
1629400	1630400	And to Ekem in...
1630400	1631400	It's like Tommy.
1631400	1635080	Now to Ekem in the chat room, the DDR show did not count.
1635080	1638840	Hold on, you've got to read what they said before you respond to it.
1638840	1640080	Hello, Radio 101.
1640080	1643000	Ekem in the chat says, what did he say?
1643000	1644000	Now I lost it.
1644000	1647600	Oh yes, do I need to remind you of that crap DDR show on TV, to which you say, it doesn't
1647600	1648600	count.
1648600	1649600	Why not?
1649600	1653400	Because, at first it was called Dance Revolution, and all it was was just fucking Mickey Mouse
1653400	1658340	Club ripoff with the slumber party girls.
1658340	1659340	Where are they now?
1659340	1660340	Oh, that's right.
1660340	1661800	No one's listening to them.
1661800	1663320	Aw, how sad.
1663320	1666200	So sad, yet another girl group gone.
1666200	1667200	Aw.
1667200	1668200	All right.
1668200	1672020	Anyhow, let's, other housekeeping, real quick, I've got to say this, remember how last week
1672020	1675800	we got a lot of phone calls on Digital Life, I even had to hang up on one caller over drama
1675800	1676800	and all that stuff.
1676800	1680600	Well, SSJ Matt, one of our listeners, was kind enough to send us a care package from
1680600	1681600	Digital Life.
1681600	1683560	So we got stuff from Digital Life.
1683560	1685640	So we, yeah, we have this little squeeze brain.
1685640	1687000	I have like 50 of those.
1687000	1688000	For Glee Max.
1688000	1691160	Well then, Eddie seemed to be interested in that, so there you go, Eddie.
1691160	1692160	Let's see what we have here.
1692160	1696800	We have a seven day free trial of Lord of the Rings Online.
1696800	1697800	You want that?
1697800	1698800	No.
1698800	1699800	I don't have an Xbox.
1699800	1700800	It's not for Xbox, it's PC.
1700800	1701800	Oh yes.
1701800	1702800	Do you have a DVD Rom?
1702800	1703800	That's okay.
1703800	1704800	It's not a very good game.
1704800	1705800	There you go.
1705800	1706800	I don't have a PC.
1706800	1710160	There was supposed to be an MMORPG, Lord of the Rings for Wii, but I think they trucked
1710160	1711160	it.
1711160	1712160	All right, you're cut off from prizes.
1712160	1713160	Ah.
1713160	1714160	Eddie, there you go.
1714160	1717160	This little flashlight, it says UMA on the side, a little flashlight.
1717160	1719040	I'll take it, because I could use a flashlight.
1719040	1720040	I don't think it works.
1720040	1721040	I have my battery.
1721040	1722440	It's an on-working flashlight.
1722440	1723440	Hello.
1723440	1727000	Look at this, all these VRares for DDR Universe.
1727000	1728000	I'll take one.
1728000	1729520	Wait, is that the original universe or the second one?
1729520	1730520	No, it's the original universe.
1730520	1731520	DDR Universe.
1731520	1732520	I'll take one anyways.
1732520	1733520	All right.
1733520	1734520	I think I might have one, but I'd take one anyway.
1734520	1735520	Well, here you go.
1735520	1736520	And there you go.
1736520	1737520	This is exciting radio.
1737520	1738520	Look at this.
1738520	1739520	Party gift for us.
1739520	1740520	Oh my God.
1740520	1741520	Are we going to joke?
1741520	1742520	I was going to joke.
1742520	1743520	Is there presents for the turn of 50?
1743520	1744520	And here they are.
1744520	1747180	Now this I might keep and give away at some point, because this is old.
1747180	1750000	This is a DDR Max sampler from Toys R Us.
1750000	1751000	I don't think they even make these anymore.
1751000	1752000	That's the way they want.
1752000	1753000	So we'll hang on to that.
1753000	1754320	Did you want a universe sampler puppy?
1754320	1755320	No.
1755320	1756320	All right, there you go.
1756320	1757320	Everybody wins.
1757320	1758320	Here at Orange On Radio.
1758320	1760320	I got a brain.
1760320	1762320	Let's see, what else do we have here?
1762320	1763320	You know, I...
1763320	1764320	Oh, Loki's going to love this.
1764320	1765320	There's no money.
1765320	1768160	I emailed McNamara to send me some free shit, and he still has an email.
1768160	1769160	Look at this.
1769160	1770160	Here it is.
1770160	1771160	Here it is, though.
1771160	1772160	Authentic Eye of Judgment cards.
1772160	1773160	Look at this.
1773160	1777440	This is a card for the biolith bomber from the Eye of Judgment.
1777440	1778600	Check that shit out right there.
1778600	1780760	It even says right on the back, the Eye of Judgment.
1780760	1781760	I'll take one.
1781760	1782760	Wait, wait, wait.
1782760	1783760	What?
1783760	1784760	I'm going to make a copy of this.
1784760	1786520	All right, you do that.
1786520	1787880	Oh my God.
1787880	1790000	That would be so impossible to copy.
1790000	1791000	Oh, wait.
1791000	1794080	No, it won't be.
1794080	1799080	A little doggy keychain there from Sirius Satellite Radio.
1799080	1800080	A puppy should have that.
1800080	1801080	Yeah, it is a puppy.
1801080	1802400	So a puppy gets the puppy keychain.
1802400	1803640	There you go.
1803640	1804640	And let's see.
1804640	1807400	Oh, some post-it notes from Newegg.
1807400	1809360	Who wants post-it notes from Newegg?
1809360	1810360	Dark Soccer does.
1810360	1811360	Posties.
1811360	1812360	There you go.
1812360	1813360	And, oh, I like this.
1813360	1814360	What is this?
1814360	1815360	This is a little...
1815360	1816360	What is this?
1816360	1817360	An iPod mini skin?
1817360	1818800	Oh, is that from iSkin?
1818800	1820160	I don't know what this is.
1820160	1821900	I can't tell.
1821900	1823540	Is it an eraser?
1823540	1824540	What is it?
1824540	1826960	It looks like an eraser.
1826960	1828160	Okay.
1828160	1833400	And last but not least, last but not least, a lollipop with a ghost on it from Pac-Man.
1833400	1834400	There you go.
1834400	1835400	Who wants a lollipop?
1835400	1836400	Oh, that's adorable.
1836400	1837400	Don't anybody eat that.
1837400	1838400	We'll just keep it forever and ever.
1838400	1839400	It's our new mascot.
1839400	1840400	There you go.
1840400	1841680	It is, totally.
1841680	1844920	Thank you, SSJ100 Matt, for the fabulous gifts and prizes.
1844920	1845920	Appreciate it.
1845920	1847600	Thank you.
1847600	1852240	There is no way that these things will not be able to, you know, not be copied.
1852240	1853240	These are...
1853240	1856840	Puppy figured out what it is, the other little thing.
1856840	1857840	It's a...
1857840	1861720	I think it's an advertisement for one other company that makes iPod skins called Jelliskins,
1861720	1864400	but they didn't actually put a real one on there.
1864400	1869080	It's just a piece of plastic that looks like an iPod with a fake one around it and something
1869080	1873640	on the back that says, take this to the booth and get two for one or something.
1873640	1877120	Well somebody forgot to take it to the booth, so we get it now here in studio.
1877120	1878680	Thank you for the prizes from Digital Life.
1878680	1879680	We appreciate it.
1879680	1881680	I think I'm going to peel this off.
1881680	1882680	Alright.
1882680	1884680	What are you...
1884680	1888720	Oh, alright, anyway.
1888720	1890880	I guess that's it for housekeeping tonight.
1890880	1894840	Finally, I think we're only about 35 minutes into tonight's show and we can finally get
1894840	1896840	into some gaming news!
1896840	1897840	Yay!
1897840	1898840	Grat!
1898840	1901880	Alright, we're starting with ding.
1901880	1906940	So there is some interesting rumors going around about a brand new Wii SKU and everyone's
1906940	1910120	all like, oh my god, what is this?
1910120	1912360	It's DVD or something, it's going to be playing.
1912360	1913360	No, don't get excited.
1913360	1914880	It's really nothing actually.
1914880	1920840	The brand new UPC or new pack as it's being dubbed, all it really is, and I've seen this
1920840	1925720	happen on a few different consoles, it's just them changing the box art.
1925720	1929920	Basically those launch games, they're a little old and dusty right now, time to put the new
1929920	1933280	shit on there to get people excited.
1933280	1934280	That's all it is.
1934280	1935280	Ooh, box art!
1935280	1936280	Oh my god!
1936280	1943880	Because they did the exact same thing in September with the PS2 Slim, they did the same thing
1943880	1954120	with the PSP, the fat system back in June, and it happens all the time, so just don't
1954120	1955120	get excited.
1955120	1956120	Calm down.
1956120	1958360	If you're getting excited, you're like, oh my god, they're finally going to release the
1958360	1959360	pink Wii.
1959360	1961320	You're like, get over it, no.
1961320	1965740	Trust me, they're not releasing any more colors because they're still not having trouble selling
1965740	1966840	the original system.
1966840	1968440	They can't make enough.
1968440	1972280	When it starts to slow down and people stop buying them, that's when the new colors will
1972280	1973280	come.
1973280	1976640	That's like at GameStop, if you buy a new DS, they're giving away a Zelda frame that's
1976640	1980640	made of cardboard, and I'm like, I have a DS, and he's like, but it's super rare, and
1980640	1983960	I'm like, so are the $120 to buy a new DS.
1983960	1987040	Good times.
1987040	1988340	Not really.
1988340	1990800	You wanted to punch him, didn't you?
1990800	1994360	It just depends what GameStop you walk into, because honestly, I walked into a GameStop
1994360	1998040	once, and I was like, I want to get Elibits, because it came out today, and I hear good
1998040	1999040	things about it.
1999040	2000040	I want to buy Elibits.
2000040	2002240	He's like, did you pre-order it to get the little free stuffed Elibit?
2002240	2005240	And I was like, no, I didn't, and he said, okay, well, here's one anyway.
2005240	2006240	I was like, woohoo.
2006240	2009480	I pre-ordered Phantom Hourglass, and they said, oh yeah, there's a swag bowl of love.
2009480	2010480	There's no swag for that.
2010480	2011480	I was like, ah.
2011480	2016480	Well, I went back to the same store when Eternal Sonata came out, because I neglected to pre-order
2016480	2018200	that, and I wanted the free faceplate.
2018200	2022600	So I went in there, and I was like, yes, I'd like to get a copy of Eternal Sonata, and
2022600	2026280	I was like, oh, I forgot to pre-order, and they were like, oh, well, we have one copy
2026280	2027280	of the game left.
2027280	2028280	Here you go.
2028280	2029280	And I'm like, what about the faceplates?
2029280	2030280	They're like, does anyone have an iPod?
2030280	2033960	Because I bet with an Exacto knife, I can make this into an actual skin.
2033960	2036360	Darkstalker actually got the thing off of the iPod.
2036360	2037360	Now it's just a piece of plastic.
2037360	2038360	What?
2038360	2039360	I didn't get anything.
2039360	2042960	Wait, no, I'm mixing up the fake radio names, sorry.
2042960	2046660	I think this is like duct tape.
2046660	2048760	It's printed duct tape.
2048760	2052960	This is wonderful radio, you taking apart one of our three little things.
2052960	2055480	Awesome sounds there doing that.
2055480	2061360	Well, hey, Eddie, you're very sad that you can't get anything free from buying Zelda.
2061360	2063600	You can get this as a Wii owner.
2063600	2067120	Nintendo is now giving away a Wii remote jacket.
2067120	2068120	That's right.
2068120	2072160	This week, Nintendo put out a press release that now there's this new sleeve that's coming
2072160	2076680	out for the Wiimotes, and let me start off by saying it's really ugly.
2076680	2079000	You know what's better?
2079000	2082600	Because Nerf did the same thing, and Nerf actually looks cool.
2082600	2085760	It basically makes your Wiimote look like an Egyptian mummy.
2085760	2093560	I don't know, I'd say it looks more like they're trying to retard-proof the controller.
2093560	2097000	Yeah, basically this is so that when you accidentally throw it at your TV because you're an idiot,
2097000	2098000	it will bounce.
2098000	2100240	Or somebody else is like, so you don't hit people in the head with it.
2100240	2101240	I'm like, what?
2101240	2105760	Well, I noticed all the padding is on the front of it, so obviously it's for projectiles
2105760	2108400	flying against it.
2108400	2111400	Wow, you'll Wii your eye out.
2111400	2115400	These are going to be shipped with all new Wii consoles, Wii remotes, and of course copies
2115400	2119760	of Wii Play, because the Wiimotes come with them, starting October 2nd, and so that means
2119760	2121400	they should be on shelves by October 15th.
2121400	2122400	Oh!
2122400	2125960	Well, maybe that's what the new SKU is then, since it was for October 2nd.
2125960	2126960	Uh, maybe.
2126960	2131860	No, but you can go to Nintendo.com, too, and get your own free one.
2131860	2135760	And then maybe that's the new box art is on the box that says, now with free Egyptian
2135760	2136760	tombs.
2136760	2139080	Here's going to be the best part, though, about it.
2139080	2144040	If it does ship with the Wii console and stuff like that, who's to say someone's actually
2144040	2146040	going to put it on their Wii remote?
2146040	2149160	Little shot there of Tutankhamen playing Wii Tennis.
2149160	2150160	And you know what?
2150160	2155000	That pretty much killed the market for those stupid Wii gloves now.
2155000	2158720	Son of Dad wants to know, do the Wii condoms have lubricant on them?
2158720	2159720	Yes.
2159720	2161920	No, but they are ribbed for her pleasure.
2161920	2164000	Have these Wiimotes inspired some type of new sick fetish?
2164000	2165000	That's disgusting.
2165000	2166000	Oh yeah.
2166000	2167000	What's wrong with you people?
2167000	2168000	Alright.
2168000	2169000	Uh, let's see, what else do we have here?
2169000	2170000	Wii-o-preenism?
2170000	2174440	Um, apparently you can actually go to Nintendo.com, or you can give this number a call.
2174440	2182000	In fact, call it right now, see what happens, 1-866-431-8367 to place your order.
2182000	2186640	You can order them now, but the free sleeves won't ship until the week of October 15th.
2186640	2190580	Make sure to ask for them to be ribbed.
2190580	2192440	For her pleasure.
2192440	2195760	I want them ribbed for my pleasure, please.
2195760	2201060	Hold on a minute here.
2201060	2203760	Can somebody go grab my Wii so I can get the serial number off it?
2203760	2204920	I don't know if anybody's actually going to answer.
2204920	2208560	Thank you for calling Nintendo's Wii remote's jacket accessory offer line.
2208560	2210760	For assistance in English, press 1.
2210760	2215280	Para assistance en español o primen numero dos.
2215280	2218200	Yes, bring the whole Wii.
2218200	2221840	Thank you for calling Nintendo's Wii remote's jacket accessory offer line.
2221840	2223840	For assistance in English, press 1.
2223840	2225840	Para assistance en español o primen numero dos.
2225840	2226840	Where's my number pad?
2226840	2227840	Where's my keypad?
2227840	2228840	There we go.
2228840	2244560	Thank you for calling Nintendo Consumer Services, this is
2244560	2245560	your number.
2245560	2249240	Did you already go online and try or is this your first attempt?
2249240	2250240	This is my first attempt.
2250240	2255960	It said I could call the number.
2255960	2259440	I was just checking because we have quite a few people who tried online and had some
2259440	2260440	difficulties.
2260440	2261440	That's why I was...
2261440	2262440	Ah, forget it.
2262440	2263440	I'm not going to bother with her.
2263440	2264440	That's so mean.
2264440	2265440	Just go put this back.
2265440	2266440	She's going to belittle me?
2266440	2278000	Well, sir, I've got like the stupid type, so I don't have a chance.
2278000	2280200	What's wrong with you, moron?
2280200	2285360	Why don't you go on the website?
2285360	2296480	At least we know it works, though.
2296480	2297480	The whole chat room.
2297480	2298480	Let's see.
2298480	2300680	Drunami says, don't fucking disrespect the call center rep.
2300680	2301680	I'm not.
2301680	2302680	Okay.
2302680	2303680	You know what, Rob?
2303680	2304680	You know what, Rob?
2304680	2305680	What?
2305680	2306680	I worked in a call center for five years.
2306680	2307680	Yes.
2307680	2308680	Yeah.
2308680	2309680	Don't disrespect the call center rep.
2309680	2310680	I'm not.
2310680	2311680	I trained for a call center.
2311680	2312680	I'm not disrespecting.
2312680	2313680	That is disrespectful.
2313680	2316600	What's the point if you tried online or not?
2316600	2317600	Did you try online?
2317600	2320080	Because really, I don't want to help you right now.
2320080	2324840	If you could just try online, that would make my life a whole lot easier so I wouldn't have
2324840	2325840	to do my job.
2325840	2328680	I often do stuff like that because when you work in a call center, you usually have a
2328680	2331760	time limit on how long you can take a call or else you get written up.
2331760	2332760	Hey, Rob.
2332760	2333760	Hey, Mike Lit.
2333760	2334760	All right.
2334760	2335760	Wonder.Carol said that call center rep was actually nice.
2335760	2336760	She was, but she was totally...
2336760	2337760	No.
2337760	2338760	Well, she gave you explanations.
2338760	2340120	They probably make her ask that.
2340120	2341120	It was scripted.
2341120	2342120	Yeah.
2342120	2343120	You can tell what scripting sounds like.
2343120	2344120	Yeah.
2344120	2345120	All right.
2345120	2346120	Rob.
2346120	2347120	Yeah.
2347120	2348120	Yeah.
2348120	2349120	All right.
2349120	2350120	Let's just move on with the show already.
2350120	2352680	First of all, Rob, never give me kettle corn again.
2352680	2354360	It's got cocaine in it.
2354360	2360760	So anyway, virtual console for the UK if anyone's interested, and the first one makes me just
2360760	2366240	totally go WTF even though I actually own the original of this game.
2366240	2369360	Fatal Fury for Neo Geo, 900 Wii points.
2369360	2370360	Whoa.
2370360	2374080	Next to nine euro, 675 pound.
2374080	2375880	Yeah.
2375880	2377720	It's a Neo Geo game.
2377720	2379040	It's Fatal Fury.
2379040	2380040	Next.
2380040	2381200	Hey, look.
2381200	2385560	Streets of Rage 3, which is actually a pretty good game.
2385560	2386560	I like this.
2386560	2391920	I miss the old beat them up games like that, although nothing was ever as awesome as Battletoads
2391920	2395400	and Double Dragon.
2395400	2402360	Then moving forward, as soon as it decides to load, Golden Axe 3 at 800 Wii points, which
2402360	2408640	was also, as it was known in the UK, Sega Mega Drive, which for us was the Genesis.
2408640	2412180	And remember, Genesis does what Nintendo don't.
2412180	2417920	And also another Mega Drive game for 800 Wii points, Super Thunder Blade, which actually
2417920	2420400	wasn't all that fun.
2420400	2426480	And last but not least, Land Stalker, the Treasure of the King Knoll, no Treasure of
2426480	2431360	King Knoll, another Mega Drive game, which I don't actually think was fun either.
2431360	2433960	End of story.
2433960	2434960	Alright.
2434960	2435960	Anyways.
2435960	2442920	So, some day, there will be some more titles for the WiiWare service, because right now
2442920	2448680	all there is is a couple channels for the Wii, but one title promised for early 2008
2448680	2456080	is going to be a game called Gravitronics, being put out by developer Metaverse.
2456080	2461080	And it's going to be a game, I guess, supporting up to eight players, and I guess it's going
2461080	2464800	to be assaulting enemy territories using shapes.
2464800	2465800	Sweet.
2465800	2467720	So, death by shapes.
2467720	2471320	What is the deal with that whole, because I'm, speaking as a Nintendo fanboy, they were
2471320	2475180	supposed to have all this stuff ready to go at launch.
2475180	2479200	And it's like a year later, they're still doing three games a week, and there's like
2479200	2482200	literally hundreds of games between these three systems.
2482200	2486680	Or Eddie, did you try going online and filling out the form to ask the question, because
2486680	2487680	I should, huh?
2487680	2489720	I should call them up and be like, bitch!
2489720	2490720	Well, okay.
2490720	2495920	Here's one thing that, a lot of the games, first off, weren't rated by the ESRB, so a
2495920	2497400	lot of those had to go through that again.
2497400	2503280	A lot of them also, they have to be made to work with the emulators, and stuff like that.
2503280	2506440	And then also, they don't give a fuck what you care!
2506440	2508120	They're just like, we're fucking Nintendo!
2508120	2509840	You can't buy our fucking system!
2509840	2511480	Why the fuck do you want to get online anyways?
2511480	2514920	You need to get your fucking system first before you can get fucking online!
2514920	2515920	No I know the semantics, but.
2515920	2518720	I don't think you should do a free fuck that much, they'll probably make up their own words.
2518720	2519720	Like fiddlesticks.
2519720	2520720	Anyway.
2520720	2521720	What the fuck?
2521720	2527480	No, really, what it comes down to is that they're just dragging their fucking feet until
2527480	2530040	they can get shit done.
2530040	2535120	Where's this WiiWare service that's supposed to be coming out years from now, I mean seriously,
2535120	2536120	when's it coming out?
2536120	2537120	We want some actual games.
2537120	2538920	How about better online service altogether?
2538920	2539920	Exactly.
2539920	2540920	Actually support online.
2540920	2541920	Nintendo online?
2541920	2542920	Exactly.
2542920	2547520	It's such a scary world, that online out there, I mean.
2547520	2551720	No cause you know, the upper browser's awesome, I like doing that on my TV, but there's really
2551720	2553960	nothing else for Nintendo online, it's like, ahh!
2553960	2555960	I mean there should be.
2555960	2560160	I can't believe it's taken them this long to even come this close to being online, given
2560160	2565100	that we've had the internet since you know, the late 70s, that you know, the government
2565100	2566100	used it.
2566100	2569440	They are seriously scared of like lawsuits, I think that's what it's coming down to because
2569440	2573240	they're afraid if they make an online service that there's going to be some kid that's going
2573240	2578320	to get lured by some rapist or something, and then oh my god, Nintendo caused the kid
2578320	2579320	to get raped.
2579320	2580320	Oh no.
2580320	2584040	Just like the fucking um, Wii jacket shit, I mean there's no reason that they need to
2584040	2585040	improve stuff.
2585040	2589400	They really see idiotic people throwing shit through their god damn TV, and now you have
2589400	2595520	this like stupid like foam shit on the like fucking remote that's going to, I guess, protect
2595520	2596520	your TV.
2596520	2597520	No.
2597520	2598520	The hell it will.
2598520	2601960	People will find more ways to do this, until this like stupid thing that the Wii's going
2601960	2607440	to sit in, the remote, it's going to be like this giant foam protective thing that's going
2607440	2610640	to look like you're waving around a giant retarded glove or something.
2610640	2616400	I mean seriously, there are idiotic people, they just need to get over that fact and just
2616400	2617680	start making better shit.
2617680	2620880	How should Nintendo be responsible for somebody else's idiocy?
2620880	2624440	There's no amount of like protection that they're going to be able to give for these
2624440	2628320	remotes to cause people not to break the tag.
2628320	2630360	I love the tag, you should actually hold on to the Wiimote.
2630360	2636420	Is that even if somebody does, you know, completely disregard an instruction that is blatantly
2636420	2637840	written on the product?
2637840	2641480	Like five minutes before every game starts, it's like, be careful, the Wiimote, ah.
2641480	2645080	Well, I have an example for you and this doesn't necessarily have to do with a video game,
2645080	2653160	but this is a primary example of how somebody can still basically bypass an entire law to
2653160	2657520	get money out of a company is there was a, and I studied this in my business law class,
2657520	2660940	so this is back to business law.
2660940	2665760	This person had a weed whacker and it said children under the age of so and such should
2665760	2670920	not be allowed anywhere near it, do not swing it back, do not do this, the company is not
2670920	2673120	responsible if this is the circumstance.
2673120	2677500	Well, this kid was following his uncle around following this weed whacker and it bounced
2677500	2681320	off of a rock, which was not a fault of the machine, it was physics.
2681320	2684880	Reach back and cut off this kid's leg.
2684880	2692340	And all of the things led up that it was operator error.
2692340	2695440	It was full operator error, it was not the fault of the product and they disregarded
2695440	2696440	all the things.
2696440	2701080	However, they managed to get somewhere close to two million out of the company.
2701080	2705040	And so I use that as my primary example, you know, if Nintendo wants to be careful then
2705040	2709180	more power to them, you know, because they're going to find ways to bleed them dry if something
2709180	2710180	like that happened.
2710180	2711180	All right.
2711180	2714400	In the interest of keeping the show under four hours tonight, we've got to move on to
2714400	2715400	the next story.
2715400	2717600	All lots of good points tonight, but we've got to keep it moving.
2717600	2722080	When we talk about Halo DS, a lot of folks when they first heard about this game, this
2722080	2727240	has got to be a bunch of bullshit, but this video came out this week that actually shows
2727240	2728240	Halo DS in action.
2728240	2729240	Listen to those noises there.
2729240	2738220	It actually looks like Zanzibar there, somebody's getting shot the F up there in Zanzibar.
2738220	2741460	So people are like, OMG, Halo DS was real at one point.
2741460	2744360	This whole video came out from an IGN blog.
2744360	2749240	Now here's the thing though, is that actually what happened is that apparently somebody
2749240	2754820	was actually modifying an engine of another game to show that Halo DS could be done and
2754820	2760000	Halo DS could be ported, and it was something that come as an idea like, hey, why don't
2760000	2765040	you let us develop a DS port of Halo, to which the answer was a resounding no.
2765040	2769160	Because of course, you know, at the time Bungie and Microsoft, you know, had their thing.
2769160	2770160	And Halo's boring.
2770160	2773960	Well, Halo's the only, you know, only on Microsoft consoles.
2773960	2775480	So it couldn't really come to DS.
2775480	2778320	Of course, as we're going to learn about a little later in the program, maybe now it's
2778320	2781880	a possibility, but somehow I kind of doubt it.
2781880	2785440	I mean the port, hey, props to the port though, the port looked pretty nice, I got to say.
2785440	2787360	So that's that.
2787360	2792400	You know, I actually, if they did it, I think that I would actually pay for it, honestly.
2792400	2796120	If it had Wi-Fi network, it might be pretty cool and have the same multiplayer capabilities.
2796120	2799920	That's what I think, although honestly, you know, I just wish for Duke Nukem 3D on DS.
2799920	2800920	Heck yeah.
2800920	2803840	Along with the text, with the voice macros.
2803840	2807160	No, they do not need Duke Nukem 3D on the DS, they need to fucking finish Duke Nukem
2807160	2809240	Forever and stop making excuses.
2809240	2813600	Yeah, they're going to hold that over our heads like a carrot in front of a horse, so...
2813600	2816040	That's fine, I've got Forever to wait for this damn game.
2816040	2817040	They better come out.
2817040	2818320	I don't care if it's going to suck.
2818320	2823120	Well, for anyone who was looking forward to Super Smash Brothers Brawl, guess who's going
2823120	2825000	to be in it?
2825000	2830960	Lucas from Mother 3, which is about the same thing as us getting, you know, Roy when the
2830960	2835960	last Smash Brothers came out because we didn't have any Fire Emblem then, so whatever.
2835960	2838480	And now we're getting Ike, and now we're getting Lucas.
2838480	2841600	So maybe they're going to go, oh, well let's pull a Fire Emblem and finally give them Mother
2841600	2843600	3 since it's already in English!
2843600	2844600	Nope.
2844600	2849040	I'm just going to have to import my copy from the UK.
2849040	2850040	Nope.
2850040	2854520	Although I think that it's funny that Joystiq did a comparison between Lucas and Mother
2854520	2858300	3 and Lucas and the Wizard.
2858300	2862580	As long as Lucas still has the ability to do PK Fire and PK Cross and all that cheap
2862580	2864440	bullshit then I'll be very happy.
2864440	2868600	They should be one of those wireless communicators with Super Smash Brothers.
2868600	2871720	Your mic is going crazy, Eddie, so we're going to unplug it and you're going to have to borrow
2871720	2875000	one of the other mics from now on because the chat room is complaining about you.
2875000	2876000	It's cutting in and out.
2876000	2877000	They can't hear it.
2877000	2878000	They can't hear it.
2878000	2879000	You have to use another mic.
2879000	2880000	It's on.
2880000	2881000	This was on a commission.
2881000	2882000	Oh, darn.
2882000	2883000	Sorry, Eddie.
2883000	2890360	Anyways, in other news, the Wii is not going to meet the demand for this holiday.
2890360	2895840	So in case you were waiting for some magical delivery of Wii systems that was going to
2895840	2900880	be able to put out millions and millions of units in the United States, think again, it's
2900880	2901880	not going to happen.
2901880	2907640	Reggie actually kind of originally claimed that there was going to be plenty of units
2907640	2913440	out there but then went back to retract that statement and of course they're trying to
2913440	2919200	up the quantities coming to the United States but still they're not going to be able to
2919200	2921000	make it.
2921000	2922840	I guess that's good that they're selling units.
2922840	2928680	I think it's so crappy though that after a year of being out, they can't fucking produce
2928680	2930000	more of these.
2930000	2939680	I don't think that there's anything in them that's really that revolutionary.
2939680	2941340	If you can find one, buy one.
2941340	2946640	That's probably the recommendation, especially if you want to get one for Christmas.
2946640	2952560	Hopefully there won't be all the camping out and everything that people have to do again
2952560	2953560	this time.
2953560	2958000	That would be kind of sucky, I don't know.
2958000	2964520	There's been some titles announced for the Neo Geo ports on the Virtual Console because
2964520	2969000	as you know, the Virtual Console is now going to be getting some Neo Geo games on it.
2969000	2972540	One of the first games that's going to come out is Fatal Fury.
2972540	2977700	Fatal Fury is only going to set you back $9, which is amazing when you consider that there's
2977700	2981160	Fatal Fury Special on Xbox Live Arcade with extra stuff for $5.
2981160	2985120	Yeah, but then again, I paid about $100 for the cart.
2985120	2987700	So I guess everybody's getting a bargain in that case.
2987700	2993100	Also you can look forward to upcoming other SNK fighting classics, World Heroes and Art
2993100	2994440	of Fighting.
2994440	2996920	And Art of Fighting was great because it has a character named after me.
2996920	3002520	There's actually a Robert in the game, so I definitely recommend Art of Fighting.
3002520	3003520	Good times.
3003520	3004720	And it has that zoom in and out.
3004720	3005720	And it has King.
3005720	3006720	Hello.
3006720	3007720	It does have King.
3007720	3008720	King's hot.
3008720	3009720	Who doesn't love King?
3009720	3010720	King has a tux.
3010720	3011720	She does.
3011720	3012720	I know it's great.
3012720	3019480	It said in her boobs, come out when you knock her out.
3019480	3025800	Well other potential title coming out on the Virtual Console, at least the ESRB's put out
3025800	3033320	ratings for it, is we have Echo Junior and Eternal Champions, which I love Eternal Champions,
3033320	3036840	but I like Eternal Champions CD better with the Cinekills.
3036840	3038520	That was so great.
3038520	3043960	Sonic 3D Blast and Light Crusader also have ratings out on them.
3043960	3045800	So yeah.
3045800	3046800	Hooray.
3046800	3048760	I want Vectorman.
3048760	3050680	Oh my God, Vectorman.
3050680	3055200	Well there's plenty other stuff coming out in the US this week.
3055200	3062240	This week we're going to see releases of such wonderfully average games as Looney Tunes
3062240	3069160	Acme Arsenal coming out on PlayStation 2, 360 and the Wii, Looney Tunes Duck Amuck on
3069160	3077960	the DS, Mountain Bike Adrenaline, a game that's attempting to make mountain biking extreme
3077960	3078960	or something.
3078960	3081480	It's coming out on PlayStation 2.
3081480	3089340	Honda SBK07, Superbike also coming out on PlayStation 2 and Backyard Football 2008.
3089340	3091840	Why the fuck do they still make more of those games?
3091840	3095160	Because they all suck.
3095160	3101800	Also coming out this week on the DS, Jackass, which I recommend that one because it's awesome.
3101800	3105800	FIFA Soccer 08 coming out on almost every single platform.
3105800	3111000	On Xbox 360, Half Life 2, the Orange Box is going to be making its way out and also on
3111000	3114400	the PC that will be coming out as well.
3114400	3120360	Sega Rally Revo on Xbox 360, PS3 and PSP.
3120360	3125980	And let's see, on the Wii, Bleach the Shattered Blade is coming out and also there's a Bleach
3125980	3128920	game coming out on the DS as well.
3128920	3129920	Bleach No.
3129920	3133140	Yes, the Blade of Fate coming out.
3133140	3137600	Let's see here, Flipper Critters on the DS.
3137600	3142560	Smash Detective 2.5, that one might be pretty interesting.
3142560	3152400	Let's see here, also on PC we're getting Thrillville off the rails and on, let's see here, the
3152400	3154560	Wii Mercury Meltdown Revolution.
3154560	3156240	I believe that's everything.
3156240	3157900	Oh, Folklore on the PS3.
3157900	3159760	That one's actually looking like a pretty good game.
3159760	3163640	It's gotten some pretty decent reviews as well.
3163640	3169360	And Final Fantasy Tactics, War of the Lions coming out on the PSP.
3169360	3171520	Ooh, that's supposed to be a good one.
3171520	3172520	I'm looking forward to that.
3172520	3176960	And then the last one, let's see here, Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron on PSP
3176960	3177960	as well.
3177960	3178960	Good times.
3178960	3179960	I do believe that's everything.
3179960	3183440	Well, let's go over to Japan and check out the upcoming release dates over in Japan for
3183440	3188640	this week on October 11th on the Xbox 360, Project Gotham Racing 4.
3188640	3191560	We just got that over here this last week and now over here in Japan you get to check
3191560	3192920	that out this week.
3192920	3197680	And coming out on the PlayStation 3, Rise from Lair, which I believe is just their version
3197680	3202040	of Lair, is coming out on October 11th as well.
3202040	3205560	Also on the PlayStation 3, The Godfather, the Dawn's Edition.
3205560	3207960	So if you're a fan of The Godfather in Japan, you get that.
3207960	3216000	You've got to love this on the PlayStation 2, Colorful Aquarium, My Little Mermaid.
3216000	3217000	This is not...
3217000	3218000	Dating sim.
3218000	3220100	Yeah, this looks like some type of dating sim or something.
3220100	3224080	This is not some aquarium like Tetris Splash or whatever.
3224080	3225600	It's just a bunch of...
3225600	3226600	It's a maid fetish game.
3226600	3228400	Yeah, it's anime girls and maid costumes.
3228400	3229400	There you go.
3229400	3230400	With kitty ears.
3230400	3231400	Exactly.
3231400	3232400	You know.
3232400	3233400	You know what we need wrong?
3233400	3234400	Otaku Boys Fap Away.
3234400	3235400	We need another Tokimeki Memorial.
3235400	3236400	Well, maybe you will someday.
3236400	3239360	Coming out on the DS, Namco Museum DS with the letter N.
3239360	3240360	Do what?
3240360	3243840	With the letter N. How many freaking Namco Museum things do you have?
3243840	3245280	Do you need another one on the DS?
3245280	3246280	Yes.
3246280	3247280	Do you?
3247280	3251360	There's a DVD of these that's like every single Namco game ever made.
3251360	3252360	For real.
3252360	3253520	Looks like there's kind of a cool new version of Pac-Man on there.
3253520	3255360	I don't know if that's Pac-Man Versus or what the hell it is.
3255360	3256360	That is Pac-Man Versus.
3256360	3257360	Is that really?
3257360	3258360	Look at that.
3258360	3260160	That's all right there on the Namco Museum of the DS.
3260160	3261320	Good times.
3261320	3267240	Also coming out on the DS, Tecmo is putting this game out and it looks like, I don't know,
3267240	3269760	some type of like spy game or something there.
3269760	3270760	I don't know if it's a point and click.
3270760	3271880	Yeah, it might be a point and clicker.
3271880	3272880	I'm not sure.
3272880	3273880	But here's the name of it.
3273880	3283920	DS Nishimura Kitoro Suspense Shintante Series Kyoto Atami Zekai no Kotou Satsui no Wanna.
3283920	3287400	I no Wanna that game.
3287400	3292760	I was looking at that and thinking of Snatcher.
3292760	3296160	I don't know if it takes longer to beat the game or pronounce the title.
3296160	3299400	So it's all right there.
3299400	3303320	And on the Sony PSP, some movies come out for those of you guys that are still in the
3303320	3308120	UMDs in Japan and you can buy this week on October 12th, Lady in the Water.
3308120	3310960	Yes, the M. Night Shyamalan classic.
3310960	3314560	And you can ogle those scrunts right there on the PlayStation 3.
3314560	3316520	Hey, how about some more?
3316520	3323640	That's the sound that I make when I'm taking Lady in the Water.
3323640	3326120	Leaving sacrifices for the Lady in the Water.
3326120	3327120	Wow.
3327120	3329920	So shall I continue with the UK releases?
3329920	3334480	Actually, really quickly, Alpha Canagram says, Skye, that is the Pac-Man that Miyamoto helped
3334480	3335520	work on.
3335520	3337600	So that's like the, I guess, newer Pac-Man game.
3337600	3340680	Oh, in that case, let me buy another Pac-Man game.
3340680	3341680	Whoo!
3341680	3343960	That ain't stopped us.
3343960	3353600	So on the 12th in the UK, Bliss Creek 2 Liberation on PC, Crash of the Titans on Xbox 360, Deadhead
3353600	3360320	Fred on PSP, Donkey Kong Jungle Climber on DS, Folklore on PlayStation 3, Half-Life 2
3360320	3366400	Episode 2, Heroes of Might and Magic 5, Tribes of the East, NBA Live 08, Portal, Project
3366400	3374560	Gotham Racing 4, Race 07, the official WTCC game, whatever that is, Skate on PlayStation
3374560	3380080	3, Spider-Man Friend or Foe, which I'm actually kind of looking forward to, Star Wars Battlefront
3380080	3387840	Renegade Squadron on PSP, TAR Chronicles on PC, Team Fortress 2, and the Orange Box.
3387840	3389080	I think I forgot to mention one.
3389080	3394040	I think this week also Donkey Kong Bongo Blast is coming out on the Wii.
3394040	3396800	I don't know if anyone should get excited about a game that was supposed to be on the
3396800	3401960	GameCube featuring the Bongos and now is on the Wii because we needed another Wii game
3401960	3404040	and it's a racing game.
3404040	3406140	I'm excited.
3406140	3407140	I tried.
3407140	3408140	I tried, guys.
3408140	3409140	I tried.
3409140	3410160	I tried.
3410160	3411160	I tried.
3411160	3412160	I tried.
3412160	3413160	Anyways.
3413160	3417500	No, seriously though, there are some other interesting things happening including more
3417500	3419600	Guitar Hero tracks being revealed.
3419600	3424000	I swear to God there's no surprise when you go play Guitar Hero 3 nowadays, which by the
3424000	3428900	way this is how Activision keeps Guitar Hero in the news every week and it's worked successfully.
3428900	3431040	Every week there's some damn Guitar Hero 3 update.
3431040	3434920	Well, there's only a couple more weeks until, you know, this game comes out, so.
3434920	3440780	But there is some good stuff being announced, When You Were Young by The Killers, Same Old
3440780	3447840	Song and Dance by Aerosmith, Helicopter by Block Party, Strichen by Disturbed, let's
3447840	3454000	see here, Devil Went Down to Georgia, which I think that was on that leaked list as...
3454000	3455800	I wonder if all these songs are on the leaked list.
3455800	3462080	Yeah, so, ooh, maybe that leaked list is real, yeah, okay.
3462080	3470780	Black Magic Woman by Santana, Hit Me With Your Best Shot by Pat Benatar, and The Seeker
3470780	3473380	by The Who, and some other shit, so.
3473380	3475280	Hit me with a wet sock.
3475280	3476280	Come on!
3476280	3486120	I don't know, it's how we used to sing it at karaoke.
3486120	3487120	Me and my imaginary...
3487120	3491200	Irene, don't say things if you don't have a microphone, seriously.
3491200	3493960	You ruin the experience for the podcast listeners.
3493960	3496960	Us as studio are amused.
3496960	3499760	Anything else you want to announce on Guitar Hero 3?
3499760	3501320	Nope.
3501320	3505080	It's coming out on the 28th, in case you haven't heard, and that's a Sunday.
3505080	3506080	Hooray.
3506080	3510640	No, but seriously though, they're going to have to keep all the attention that they can
3510640	3515600	possibly get, because about a month after that is when Rock Band comes out, and then,
3515600	3517180	I don't know.
3517180	3521240	You know, a friend of mine used to sing it on stage once, with me with your big cock.
3521240	3522240	Come on!
3522240	3523880	Is that your grandma too?
3523880	3526920	No, that was not my grandma, you fucking bastard.
3526920	3531800	Why is it funny when I read this?
3531800	3532800	Alright.
3532800	3533800	Alright.
3533800	3537120	Anyhow, um, moving on.
3537120	3540520	I will probably not be playing too much of Guitar Hero 3, because I'm too busy being
3540520	3545040	addicted to MMOs, and one MMO that maybe I should really check out sometime, because
3545040	3548320	I've heard a lot of things about it, City of Heroes.
3548320	3553760	City of Heroes is actually going to be getting a new update called A Stitch in Time, where
3553760	3559720	the heroes will get to go into a new universe, and get to relive some of the major events
3559720	3564640	that have happened in the past to shape Paragon City, which is where all the City Heroes folks
3564640	3565640	live.
3565640	3569200	Oh my god, such a ripoff of Final Fantasy XI.
3569200	3573860	Not really, because this is, no, no, I say no, because this is letting them relive events
3573860	3575360	that, you know, the game's been on for years.
3575360	3576360	I'm just kidding, I'm not serious.
3576360	3577360	Both of them suck.
3577360	3578360	Oh, okay, thank god.
3578360	3581480	Yeah, like they're the first people to ever think of, you know, going back in time, seriously.
3581480	3586000	There will be new power sets, including dual blades, willpower, new customization, weapons,
3586000	3587840	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3587840	3590200	City of Heroes fans are excited, I'm sure.
3590200	3593640	However, I still have not checked out City of Heroes, but I've heard good things about
3593640	3594640	Chat.
3594640	3595640	Chat room, tell me about City of Heroes.
3595640	3596640	Any of you guys play it?
3596640	3598980	If so, what am I missing?
3598980	3605080	I think that it's got, like, this thing where, um, I think it has, like, some sort of rotating
3605080	3607800	experience thing.
3607800	3608800	I don't know.
3608800	3611920	I think the best part of that game would be creating your character.
3611920	3615160	I could see myself sitting there for an hour in the create your character mode, and then
3615160	3616160	that's it.
3616160	3618400	And then at the end, Stan Lee remakes your costume.
3618400	3620260	Yeah, exactly.
3620260	3621260	And I get dismissed.
3621260	3626640	I have to throw away my costume, because I'm not a true superhero, because I tried to kick
3626640	3627640	the baby.
3627640	3634640	Well, in other MMORPG news, and we all know that MMORPG means Many Men Online Roleplaying
3634640	3639920	Girls, for those who are playing World of Warcraft, which I am not numbered among you
3639920	3646840	since my computer died, I am playing better games, well, they have done their own version
3646840	3652840	of Oktoberfest in World of Warcraft, Brewfest, which is really what Oktoberfest should be
3652840	3658320	called anyway, don't you think, where you can run around in Lederhosen and eat pretzels
3658320	3660120	in game.
3660120	3662000	And listen to German Polka, which is awesome.
3662000	3665360	You know what makes it even better is if you actually have significant amounts of alcohol
3665360	3667540	there with you at your computer.
3667540	3670720	You can actually get these things from little Brewfest vendors, and if you drink them, they
3670720	3674400	actually give you buffs, they're useful items, but then they make your screen all wavy, and
3674400	3675400	like, it fucks with you.
3675400	3678600	Like, if you have a, you know, if, what, oh god, here comes Irene.
3678600	3680160	How long have you been playing WoW?
3680160	3682920	Because they have alcoholic drinks, like, from the inn.
3682920	3686680	No, but this one's different, like, instead of making your screen blurry, this one made
3686680	3688480	my screen, like, pulsate, it was really weird.
3688480	3692000	Like, I've only ever drank the alcoholic drinks that make the screen blurry, and then they
3692000	3693000	blur more and more as you drink them.
3693000	3697200	Isn't that kind of sad, people that, like, drink alcohol in-game, it's like, I'm too
3697200	3698200	scared to try it in my life.
3698200	3700620	Well, everybody tries it once, I mean, come on.
3700620	3701620	In-game, like.
3701620	3703620	Well, yeah, because you want to see what your character's like drunk.
3703620	3707080	Like, is this what it's really like, I'm never drinking ever again, like, that's pretty
3707080	3708080	sad.
3708080	3713320	No, I'll tell you what happens when you really drink in real life, is you get a bright idea
3713320	3716960	to form an internet radio program with your friends, and then you can't escape it for
3716960	3718600	over 250 weekly episodes.
3718600	3720880	No, no, Rob, that's when you're bored on the Bart.
3720880	3723280	No, when you get, when you get drunk, you marry Irene.
3723280	3726600	No, no, no, that's, no, that's a joke.
3726600	3728800	Eddie tells a funny joke and gets a test paper score.
3728800	3729800	That's a joke.
3729800	3730800	That's a joke from a party.
3730800	3733240	Well, that's just funny after a conversation.
3733240	3736840	No, Irene got married at a party when this guy was drunk, so.
3736840	3738800	Yeah, his name's William.
3738800	3739800	Okay.
3739800	3740800	And he's Asian.
3740800	3744400	Um, totally random sidebar conversation, it has nothing to do with gaming, but it needs
3744400	3745400	to be told.
3745400	3749680	Um, Jamie and I last night went to a movie, we went and saw that across the universe.
3749680	3750680	It was great.
3750680	3751680	The thing would be, you know, it was okay.
3751680	3752680	It had good parts.
3752680	3754320	But I didn't like the whole thing.
3754320	3755320	Whatever.
3755320	3756320	It's like a quilt.
3756320	3757320	Some sections are nice, but the whole thing is ugly.
3757320	3758480	He gave it the Xanadu rating, okay?
3758480	3759680	Yeah, okay, anyway.
3759680	3763560	That's not what we were talking about, but on the drive home, somehow the topic of going
3763560	3764560	to Vegas came up.
3764560	3765560	Who was always in the car?
3765560	3766560	It was me, my roommate, my boyfriend, and you, right?
3766560	3767560	My roommate.
3767560	3768560	Yeah, my roommate.
3768560	3769560	Our roommate is a doll in the car.
3769560	3770560	And John.
3770560	3771560	Yeah, my roommate.
3771560	3772560	John.
3772560	3774280	We were in the car, and we were taking about going to Vegas and wanting to go to Vegas.
3774280	3778400	And we were talking about wanting to talk about... Because you know how like everybody's
3778400	3780100	all... I think the topic of Britney Spears came up.
3780100	3782380	Now you know how everybody's always talking about, oh, the sanctity of marriage?
3782380	3785060	No, we were talking about the sanctity of marriage and we were bringing up examples
3785060	3786060	of why there's no sanctity.
3786060	3789000	You know, and those laws, and I don't mean to make it political, but whatever.
3789000	3793640	The laws in those states pass, you know, marriage should always be a man and woman to protect
3793640	3796020	the sanctity of marriage, you know?
3796020	3799140	then we talk about Britney Spears gets married in an old within 48 hours.
3799140	3802020	Excellent example of the sanctity of marriage at work, right?
3802020	3805180	So we're talking about who would you go to Vegas and get married and
3805180	3806100	then divorce right away.
3806100	3809980	Like we were talking, let's go to, since we can't, since like us being gay,
3809980	3813020	we can't marry each other, well, Jamie's already married, she can't remarry.
3813020	3815060	But the rest of us are all gay, we can't marry each other.
3815060	3815660	I can pretend.
3815660	3818700	So we're gonna marry women and go to Vegas and
3818700	3820180	just get married to a woman and then divorce.
3820180	3821860	So they were saying, who should I marry?
3821860	3824780	And then your name came up, Irene, as to somebody I should marry.
3824780	3829540	And I was like, no, I don't even want to be married to her for an hour.
3829540	3832540	Why do you look so sad?
3832540	3834420	You could marry Eddie or something.
3834420	3835900	I would marry Eddie.
3835900	3837980	What? We're gonna get married when we're 30.
3837980	3840100	Why did you look so shocked that I wouldn't marry you?
3840100	3841180	Because you don't want to marry me.
3841180	3843580	But it would be a dysfunctional marriage.
3843580	3844940	I mean, it would be really bad.
3844940	3846020	It would be really bad.
3846020	3848500	Everybody wants to marry me, you're up, you're just-
3848500	3852260	I had the bright idea of having a group wedding and then a group annulment.
3852260	3855620	That's a great idea, we should do that right now.
3855620	3856460	Forget the show.
3856460	3859260	Rob, Irene's already married to somebody that you know, so.
3859260	3859820	Well, really?
3861540	3862060	Yeah.
3862060	3863300	Did she marry my boyfriend when I wasn't-
3863300	3864500	Yeah, exactly.
3864500	3866500	Good job. And he does crazy things to her all the time.
3866500	3868100	Are you putting out?
3868100	3869620	According to him, she is.
3869620	3870140	Well.
3870140	3871700	Can you see the pictures on my MySpace?
3871700	3872220	Well.
3872220	3873020	Oh my gosh.
3873020	3873580	Yeah, Irene.
3873580	3874780	I mean, there's no pictures.
3874780	3875460	What?
3875460	3876660	Huh?
3876660	3877580	I don't really know what,
3877580	3880060	maybe it's because I've been drinking a little bit here in studio tonight.
3880060	3881580	But yeah, that had nothing to do with games.
3881580	3882300	Yeah, Irene-
3882300	3884220	Why don't you be sitting over there doing like the,
3884220	3886500	either the I've got to go to the bathroom dance or god damn it,
3886500	3887740	can we talk about video games?
3887740	3890460	Irene makes chocolate something that was on his shirt.
3892460	3897460	I like grapes.
3897460	3899340	Eddie brings the show to a screeching halt.
3899340	3900100	Ten gamers score.
3902180	3903020	Anyways.
3903020	3904060	I also like beer.
3905540	3906860	Beer is great.
3906860	3908540	Beer makes this show possible.
3908540	3910100	I'm sure I'm going to get some emails on that one.
3910100	3916020	We got an email, we got emails in the past about me bashing on Sony and
3916020	3919500	you know, and stuff like that and saying that we should do it less.
3919500	3923900	But honestly, they make it so easy.
3923900	3925460	I mean, really.
3925460	3931500	Okay, for example, this mystical new 40 gigabyte PlayStation 3
3931500	3935980	skew, which we had no idea was going to come out, is now made official.
3935980	3939380	And you know, earlier this week there was rumors saying, oh,
3939380	3943340	it's not going to be backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 games at all.
3943340	3945900	And then people were like, oh no, of course it will be because, you know,
3945900	3949540	they do it all via software emulation and that kind of stuff.
3949540	3951620	Well, come to find out, guess what?
3951620	3955260	It isn't backwards compatible with any PlayStation 2 games.
3955260	3961180	So they removed essentially a free part of the PlayStation 3.
3961180	3962820	Just to fuck you all over again.
3964100	3965900	So it is official for Europe.
3965900	3968180	It's going to be coming out here pretty soon.
3968180	3971700	It is not backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 titles at all.
3971700	3977420	It will be coming out on October 10th for a price of 399 euros.
3977420	3982260	And it will only have two USB ports instead of four, which is not a huge deal.
3982260	3986540	And none of the multi-memory card ports, which is also not a real big deal.
3986540	3991540	But come on, no backwards compatibility PlayStation 2 games?
3991540	3996860	I mean, yeah, I'm sure that they'll be busy playing your entire library of
3996860	3998620	games for the PlayStation 3.
3998620	4001860	Why do you need PlayStation 2 games when you have Motorstorm and Lair?
4001860	4003740	Oh, well, my mistake.
4003740	4006180	Oh, you know, forgive me.
4006180	4009700	So it's not even backwards compatible with patches on the hard drive?
4009700	4010580	No, not at all.
4010580	4015100	In fact, it is only, I guess it is backwards compatible PlayStation 1 games
4015100	4017940	because they are part of the download network and I guess they have downloads
4017940	4019060	for that stuff.
4019060	4021940	But I don't understand what they were thinking.
4021940	4024420	I mean, really, that is like crazy.
4024420	4027740	The fact that it'll still do the PlayStation 1 games, I mean, and to play
4027740	4032260	Devil's Advocate, one comment I've heard on this is, well, why is it such a big
4032260	4034220	deal when you have a PlayStation 2 right there on the shelf?
4034220	4036180	Do you really need it to play PlayStation 2 games?
4036180	4039740	I say yes, because A, I know people who don't know PlayStation 2s.
4039740	4040460	Imports.
4040460	4045140	And B, PlayStation 2s sometimes break a while later.
4045140	4047620	Well, but you can't play PlayStation 2 imports.
4047620	4048260	They're not region free.
4048260	4049620	I've seen them.
4049620	4051100	On a Japanese PlayStation 3, you can.
4051100	4051820	Nope.
4051820	4052740	No, you can't.
4052740	4054180	There's video proof out there, I'll tell you.
4054180	4059780	You cannot play Japanese games on PlayStation 2s or PlayStation 3s of other
4059780	4060220	regions.
4060220	4062300	Only PlayStation 3 games are region free.
4062300	4065500	Then the game might not have been coded.
4065500	4070340	You know, it's just, it's really, really stupid.
4070340	4075420	I don't know what the hell they were thinking, but hey, if you want to, you
4075420	4078460	know, buy one of these, they will be available.
4078460	4080820	I mean, save yourself some money, I guess.
4080820	4083540	Maybe it's because they don't really want to cut the price on these.
4083540	4088020	And this is their way of, I don't know, getting people to buy the, I don't
4088020	4088260	know.
4088260	4091700	I really, they're like, well, we're offering these cheaper skews, but it's
4091700	4094180	even starting with the 20 gig PS3.
4094180	4097460	It's like, well, we have this cheaper skew, but it's kind of, you know, a
4097460	4098660	little bit gimped.
4098660	4102740	So maybe just spend the extra $100 or whatever and buy the better one.
4102740	4104300	You know, and it's kind of what they've been doing.
4104300	4106860	It's like we're throwing out this crap car.
4106860	4110540	It's like you can either choose this car with no wheels, no steering wheel, no
4110540	4116180	airbags, and no gas tank, or you could buy this Ferrari.
4116180	4117660	Which would you like?
4117660	4121540	I love this comment in the chatroom from Escapist at chat.orangelandradio.com
4121540	4124100	says, reactions to criticism.
4124100	4125940	Nintendo gets angry.
4125940	4128740	Microsoft is sorry and tries to fix the problem.
4128740	4132980	Sony goes and pleasures itself in the corner while singing show tunes.
4132980	4136780	OK, honestly, I mean, this, I don't know if this is officially coming over
4136780	4138540	to the US yet, and so far it's not.
4138540	4141380	My fair lady, is that me?
4141380	4146980	So far it's not, but I mean, really, clang, clang, clang goes the trolley.
4146980	4147980	Let me put it this way.
4147980	4152620	If you're really serious on getting the PlayStation 3, and you're waiting for
4152620	4158300	Metal Gear Solid 4, Grand Theft Auto 4, Final Fantasy 13, I suggest you purchase
4158300	4161660	the console closer to the time when these games come out.
4161660	4165700	Because by then they're going to have about four other skews that will have
4165700	4172060	varying degrees of crippled technology versus discount and stuff, and you can
4172060	4173060	make a better decision.
4173060	4176860	I mean, because honestly right now, spending the money to buy a crippled
4176860	4179500	system is kind of stupid.
4179500	4182500	And no people have been drawn to comparison, well, the core system doesn't
4182500	4186260	allow you to play backwards compatible games right out of the box, yeah, but
4186260	4189160	you can buy a hard drive for that later on, and then you can play backwards
4189160	4190160	compatible games.
4190160	4191160	This, you're fucked.
4191160	4193060	So, I don't get it.
4193060	4196540	I don't get why you would remove something that's free.
4196540	4197860	It boggles my mind.
4197860	4199580	I don't understand.
4199580	4206220	I'm just a girl who can't say no, I'm in a terrible fix.
4206220	4217540	I'm singing in the rain.
4217540	4219380	This is great radio, you have.
4219380	4223220	See, that is the camera, oh, the camera's not on.
4223220	4225780	No, the cam shut off after 40 minutes.
4225780	4226780	Anyway.
4226780	4228860	But you know, I hear that there's going to be a new skew or something coming
4228860	4232380	out over here with Spider-Man 3 bundled with it, so hey, at least you have a
4232380	4233900	fucking Blu-ray player.
4233900	4235660	There you go.
4235660	4240100	Well, obviously, needless to say, this news makes us a little bit agitated,
4240100	4242660	especially for those of us that were hoping to clear the space on the shelves,
4242660	4246420	or maybe see some upscaled PlayStation 2, you know, that would have been kind
4246420	4247820	of cool too, and have some places to go.
4247820	4248820	Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
4248820	4252180	Let me interrupt you real quick, because I forgot to add Sony's official
4252180	4256340	comment to explain why they decided not to put backwards compatibility in
4256340	4257340	there.
4257340	4262620	It says, let's see here, there is sufficient choice in the marketplace,
4262620	4267820	and that we're still better off using that money that we put into backwards
4267820	4272100	compatibility, either investing in new games or using that money to help
4272100	4274740	support bringing the price down.
4274740	4278260	We have made it clear on many occasions that our priority is on
4278260	4282300	developing innovative new features and services for the PlayStation 3, not
4282300	4284660	on backwards compatibility.
4284660	4291300	Okay, but they have it built into the firmware right now.
4291300	4292980	Why remove it?
4292980	4294460	Because that's just being a dick.
4294460	4296460	That's what it is.
4296460	4304460	When you're a gent, you know you're a gent.
4304460	4319420	Oh, by the way, I would like to remind you guys that Phil Harrison back
4319420	4323380	about a year ago said, backwards compatibility, as you know from
4323380	4328860	PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2, is a core value of what we believe we
4328860	4334340	should offer, and access to a library of content people have created, bought
4334340	4338940	for themselves and accumulated over the years, is necessary to create a
4338940	4339940	format.
4339940	4343780	PlayStation is a format meaning that it transcends many devices,
4343780	4348980	PS1, PS2, and now PS3.
4348980	4352780	Well they also said that all the game developers copied their controller
4352780	4355540	design forgetting that they copied theirs from Super Nintendo, so you
4355540	4356540	know.
4356540	4357540	Whatever.
4357540	4358540	Let's continue.
4358540	4367060	Well, actually, Sony actually released an official statement on the
4367060	4370060	matter.
4370060	4383380	What is that from?
4383380	4388060	You can't stop PS3, you can't stop it, you can't, can't stop the PS3.
4388060	4396060	They probably think they're winning right now.
4396060	4397060	We are winning.
4397060	4401060	You can't buy a PS3 anywhere.
4401060	4406060	Sorry, I mean, but seriously, every week is a fucking story like this.
4406060	4409460	I mean, who the fuck is running their company?
4409460	4412300	I mean, how do they, how do they make these decisions?
4412300	4413300	Hey, let's have-
4413300	4414300	Champanzies.
4414300	4415740	I mean, who thinks up this shit?
4415740	4416740	I swear to God.
4416740	4418380	I read the joke earlier this week.
4418380	4421580	There's some guy on their advertising or marketing strategies
4421580	4424180	team or whatever that's trying to get fired and come up with the
4424180	4428060	stupidest fucking ideas and wanting to get himself fired, and they're
4428060	4430900	like, hey, that's a great idea, let's run with that, and it's like, my
4430900	4431900	God.
4431900	4435100	I mean, who thinks this is a crazy idea?
4435100	4436100	You know what?
4436100	4439420	I think what they do is that they have those magnets, you know, that
4439420	4444340	you make your own poetry out of on their phone, and so they just, they
4444340	4447700	reach in and grab like six of them and put them in order, and that's
4447700	4452220	their new marketing plan, and that'll, and it's not people that are
4452220	4453220	picking them out.
4453220	4454220	They're trained monkeys.
4454220	4459060	No, they're, they're poorly trained monkeys, and sometimes they have to wipe the poo off
4459060	4472740	of them that they fling as they pick it.
4472740	4490340	So how many beers did you have, Rob?
4490340	4495300	Just one, amazingly.
4495300	4501420	Now's a good time for the F-use of the week, as our chat room is just,
4501420	4504620	all I'm seeing in chat room is like, dot, dot, dot, just right on down
4504620	4506340	the screen.
4506340	4507780	Let's get into the F-use of the week.
4507780	4510260	Ladies and gentlemen, we have some brand new old F-U music.
4510260	4513900	We're bringing back an old F-U tonight, and let's kick it off.
4513900	4515900	This is a part of the show where we get angsty, and obviously this news
4515900	4518860	about the removed backwards compatibility, which seems to be a step
4518860	4521620	backwards, makes us a little angry, and if you disagree, send us an email,
4521620	4540860	mailbag at orangeontraded.com, but for now, the F-U's of the week.
4540860	4548300	So my F-U of the week goes towards bitches, stupid petty bitches.
4548300	4550740	But Jamie, then you're screwing yourself.
4550740	4555180	Now, okay, this is what happened at work.
4555180	4558060	Now people know that I like to leave detailed diagrams on how people
4558060	4559860	should park in a parking lot.
4559860	4561420	I didn't do that this time.
4561420	4564540	I was pulling into one of the last parking spots at work, and there was this
4564540	4568180	car that was double parked, and I nearly ran into their driver's side rear
4568180	4569540	of the mirror.
4569540	4573300	So I back out, park properly in the spot, and leave them a note that says,
4573300	4574780	please do not double park.
4574780	4576060	I even said please.
4576060	4579660	It was either that or call security and get them a ticket, and if they get
4579660	4582940	ticketed enough, then they have to park outside the parking lot.
4582940	4585580	But we have a gate at the parking lot.
4585580	4589540	So I go back in, and I go out, and these girls are standing around my car,
4589540	4593340	kneeling down by my tires, and I can hear these loud echoing voices, and
4593340	4595700	hear tire, and note, and this.
4595700	4596700	And then my mother calls me.
4596700	4597700	I'm like, crap, mom.
4597700	4600980	So I'm talking to my mom, standing by the back door, watching them do shit to
4600980	4603940	my car, and I have no idea what they're doing, and then they get in their car
4603940	4606580	and drive past, and then I hear, oh, there she is!
4606580	4607580	Like that.
4607580	4611340	So I'm on the phone with my mother, and you don't want to get into a fight
4611340	4614740	with loud people when you're on the phone with your mother, although my mom
4614740	4616620	would probably be very proud of me.
4616620	4617620	Not really.
4617620	4618620	So I go back-
4618620	4619620	Question from chat real quick.
4619620	4623820	SSJ100Matt asks, where was YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com in this moment?
4623820	4626260	I didn't have any of the stickers on me.
4626260	4629500	So I go back inside, wait five minutes, go back out after I'm off the phone
4629500	4631300	with my mom, and they're gone.
4631300	4634100	So I go back to my car, and I go about my business.
4634100	4635100	Everything seems fine.
4635100	4638140	You know, I have a magnet on my car, this little rainbow heart, and I thought
4638140	4641100	that they stole it, but it turned out that my husband took it off when he was
4641100	4643140	driving my car when he was fixing it.
4643140	4647660	So I get back, and my tires had been low for a couple weeks, so I said, you know,
4647660	4650660	I'm getting gas today, I'll go ahead and fill my tires.
4650660	4654940	And I tried to get the caps off on the passenger side, and the caps wouldn't
4654940	4659140	come off on the valve stems on my tires, but the other side was just fine.
4659140	4662780	So I end up going to Bridgestone the next day, and they had used two wrenches
4662780	4667880	to get the caps off, and it turned out that they put nail glue, like super glue,
4667880	4669940	in the caps on my tires.
4669940	4674300	So now, see, I think it would have been much better for them to be a little
4674300	4680740	peeved about a little note than be fired for vandalism and harassment, because
4680740	4682260	that's what's going to happen to them.
4682260	4685420	I have the exact time of day that they drove out of the parking lot, and we
4685420	4690500	have cameras that record all driver's, all license plates as they go in and
4690500	4691500	out.
4691500	4693540	When you are by the place, when you get your new badge, you are required
4693540	4695980	to give your license plate number to security.
4695980	4699740	They're going to be very fired, all four of them, and I am going to laugh my
4699740	4700740	ass off.
4700740	4701740	The end.
4701740	4706380	Wow, I didn't know we had applause.
4706380	4709180	There's an applause light in here, apparently.
4709180	4710180	All right, moving on.
4710180	4712660	No, no, no, because see, this is what I mean.
4712660	4714660	You don't fuck with me.
4714660	4715660	Low key.
4715660	4716660	Follow that.
4716660	4717660	F.E.
4717660	4721900	Donald's for not knowing how to fucking cook french fries, and you just put
4721900	4723940	them in the fucking fryer and push buttons.
4723940	4724940	How hard is that?
4724940	4729300	But yet, you fucking find a way to screw it up every single time.
4729300	4734300	I mean, seriously, fries should taste the same every single time.
4734300	4738620	Every time, because it's a button that you push.
4738620	4740580	How the fuck do you fuck up a button?
4740580	4743740	I mean, really?
4743740	4744740	Fuck that.
4744740	4745740	My F.E.
4745740	4746740	Of The Week.
4746740	4747740	Come on.
4747740	4749740	Showing us signs of support tonight.
4749740	4750740	All right.
4750740	4751740	I'm going to keep my F.E.
4751740	4753740	Brief tonight, because the others were a little long.
4753740	4754740	Not that that's a problem.
4754740	4755740	My F.E.'s brief tonight.
4755740	4758100	I'm going to give an F.E. to show tunes.
4758100	4760100	Enough said.
4760100	4764460	Puppy, you're up next.
4764460	4770260	I give an F.E. to the California DMV for being slow as fuck, even online.
4770260	4774300	I paid my registration for my car two and a half weeks ago.
4774300	4777740	They still have not sent me my new tax.
4777740	4778740	And it's pissing me off.
4778740	4780900	And I'm waiting to get pulled over for it.
4780900	4782900	And it's going to suck.
4782900	4783900	Hold your...
4783900	4784900	Hold.
4784900	4788900	Okay, now you can applaud.
4788900	4790500	Casper the Gay, your F.E.'s of The Week.
4790500	4794500	Okay, I'm going to recant my F.E. to LucasArts, because they were really slow about getting
4794500	4795700	a Star Wars game to Wii.
4795700	4797420	But they are going to have Force Unleashed on the Wii.
4797420	4800140	And of course, it's going to be the best version, because it'll have all the lightsaber battles
4800140	4801440	and force control and stuff.
4801440	4803980	So yay, LucasArts.
4803980	4806020	That wasn't a true F.U., so you don't get applause.
4806020	4807020	I had to recant it, so...
4807020	4808020	In fact, you get booed.
4808020	4809020	Okay, they suck.
4809020	4810020	They're shitheads.
4810020	4813620	How can you recant something that you never said in the first place?
4813620	4814620	Yeah, I did.
4814620	4815620	A couple weeks ago.
4815620	4816620	Three or four...
4816620	4817620	Yeah.
4817620	4818620	Rice Princess, your turn.
4818620	4822020	F.U. to recanting stuff that you never said in the first place.
4822020	4823020	Yay!
4823020	4828140	I'm sort of trying to clap.
4828140	4838540	Back to the show, from Angst and F.U.s to Harvest Moon.
4838540	4842260	Harvest Moon, if you are a fan of farming, and actually I know there's some fans of Harvest
4842260	4846020	Moon, because I dared to make fun of Harvest Moon.
4846020	4849420	What else do you do on Harvest Moon?
4849420	4852300	You try to pick up a chick.
4852300	4854860	I know we have some fans of Harvest Moon, because I got yelled at by one one week in
4854860	4855860	an email.
4855860	4856860	You're a fan of Harvest Moon.
4856860	4858980	Okay, well then good, this ought to be good news.
4858980	4862660	The Harvest Moon creator, Yasuo Iwata, has announced that the next Harvest Moon game
4862660	4865460	is going to be online.
4865460	4869500	Meaning that between two and eight players can actually visit a town.
4869500	4872860	The only trick, we don't know what platform the game's on yet.
4872860	4876180	But the next Harvest Moon game will be online.
4876180	4877180	So there it is.
4877180	4878780	And it won't be Nintendo.
4878780	4879780	Well, not necessarily.
4879780	4880780	It could be DS.
4880780	4882420	That could be a very DS thing.
4882420	4885980	What are you going to do, have competitive cow milking?
4885980	4888260	Stop releasing so many damn Harvest Moon games.
4888260	4891380	There's been like four this year already, and there's still more coming.
4891380	4892380	Well, no, I'm serious.
4892380	4895020	What are you going to do, have competing farms or some shit?
4895020	4896820	Or go visit other people's cows?
4896820	4900460	What the hell did you do in Animal Crossing?
4900460	4903380	You ran to towns and hit people with bug nets, and it was funny.
4903380	4904760	Or buried things in holes.
4904760	4906900	And you sent dirty letters to their townsfolk.
4906900	4909500	That's right, and you buried pitfalls in front of people's houses.
4909500	4912500	No, I'll tell you what you do in Animal Crossing.
4912500	4917220	You play the game with your best friend, only to have him backstab you and get the trophy
4917220	4919380	first.
4919380	4921420	Did you forget, Rob, so easily?
4921420	4923940	Yeah, actually, I did forget.
4923940	4925700	Somebody's got some issues.
4925700	4927260	Hey, you know what?
4927260	4929260	It hurt.
4929260	4933500	Well, you're seriously mad that I went and got the gold villager?
4933500	4934500	I was mad for like two minutes.
4934500	4936260	I was like, stupid motherfucker.
4936260	4937660	It's been a little longer than two minutes.
4937660	4938980	It's been like two and a half years.
4938980	4939980	Well, you know what?
4939980	4941980	I thought about it again, okay?
4941980	4942980	Jeez.
4942980	4943980	Work with me on this.
4943980	4944980	Gosh.
4944980	4945980	Oops.
4945980	4946980	You know what?
4946980	4952620	I want factory moon, where instead of having a cow on a farm, you have a cow factory.
4952620	4955260	You have like a deer, like a, you know, cow shwits.
4955260	4958780	Yeah, I was going to say, all they need to do is put a slaughterhouse in Harvest Moon,
4958780	4960900	and the game will be like ten times cooler.
4960900	4963020	Well, they do have-
4963020	4964940	PETA will protest.
4964940	4971620	They do have Innocent Life, a futuristic Harvest Moon, which takes farming to the future.
4971620	4972620	Guess what?
4972620	4980180	It's just the same as farming now, except it's in the future.
4980180	4982780	Hurrah.
4982780	4984100	Let's go on to the next story.
4984100	4987060	I don't think there's anything more we can say on Harvest Moon.
4987060	4989460	Except that it's Harvest Moon.
4989460	4995340	So this should, this is actually pretty, and I love stuff like this, where they do studies
4995340	5000820	about how video games improve your intelligence and your skills and shit.
5000820	5004620	They're saying now that action games improve women's spatial abilities.
5004620	5006100	Okay.
5006100	5010820	Because they didn't have any to begin with.
5010820	5013260	I'm asking a hypothetical question.
5013260	5020260	It says that it helps improve skills like geometry, technical drawings, reading maps.
5020260	5023180	Anything that has to do with space and how-
5023180	5026060	Not that a woman would ever admit to doing that.
5026060	5031340	Why do you need geometry for shopping anyway?
5031340	5032340	Geometry?
5032340	5034340	What is that?
5034340	5035340	Geometry?
5035340	5036340	What?
5036340	5037340	I'm just kidding.
5037340	5039340	Here, take this back.
5039340	5046540	But it's more or less the cognitive function of how things fit, how things are laid out.
5046540	5051500	Space, you know, judging distances, that type of thing.
5051500	5059580	But I look at it this way, that anything that you do that makes you use that skill should
5059580	5060740	improve it.
5060740	5066620	So really, a video game could help with that, but so could actually, you know, practicing
5066620	5073100	topography or, you know, spending time drawing or-
5073100	5074100	Raising cows.
5074100	5075800	No, not raising cows.
5075800	5081660	So which one of those abilities focuses on using the turn signal when switching lanes?
5081660	5082660	You know what?
5082660	5084460	I have actually run across more male drivers-
5084460	5087220	I was trying very hard to refrain from the driving joke.
5087220	5088460	You should be very proud of me.
5088460	5092060	I was trying very hard not to say, but will it make them better drivers?
5092060	5094140	I was doing very, very good.
5094140	5095140	You know what?
5095140	5096940	Gender has absolutely nothing to do with bad driving.
5096940	5100400	It's overall intelligence, and I've run it across more male drivers who are worse drivers
5100400	5101400	than women.
5101400	5103940	Okay, well then this makes the point, why just women?
5103940	5106060	Why doesn't it give men better spatial abilities?
5106060	5110060	Because I think that they've just did the study on women.
5110060	5112060	Because we're super awesome.
5112060	5113060	No.
5113060	5117300	Because I know that the majority of people in this room are male, but I'm sorry, testosterone
5117300	5118300	makes you stupid.
5118300	5119300	Oh, snap.
5119300	5120300	No, no, no, no.
5120300	5121300	This is Rob's party.
5121300	5122300	What are you talking about, testosterone?
5122300	5133900	I don't mean it like that, but I think that having a higher tendency toward aggression
5133900	5135940	usually leads to less common sense.
5135940	5136940	I see.
5136940	5140660	Now, JV Monn in the chat room gives a comment that makes it all make sense.
5140660	5144300	JV Monn says, men get better spatial ability from masturbating.
5144300	5147820	So you know how much clearance you need?
5147820	5150220	There you go.
5150220	5156140	I don't really think that men have, I don't really think, after living in a house and
5156140	5161580	having my husband and all of his friends over, I don't think that, from that sample, I don't
5161580	5168140	think that all men have good spatial ability or else they wouldn't pee on the seat.
5168140	5172100	And we learn how to close the seat when they're done.
5172100	5173340	Hey, you know what?
5173340	5178580	Some things are skill, some things are luck, okay?
5178580	5179580	You know what?
5179580	5181780	You learn how to pee when you're little, so you should have a lot of practice.
5181780	5183620	God, is this segment done yet?
5183620	5184620	Never.
5184620	5185620	Oh, lordy.
5185620	5189580	This is probably going to be like our longest segment in a long time.
5189580	5191060	We're already over an hour and a half.
5191060	5192060	Anyway.
5192060	5193060	Anyways.
5193060	5194060	Yes, please.
5194060	5206580	Speaking of pee, SingStar R&B has been announced, because god damn there hasn't been enough SingStar
5206580	5214380	games this year yet, but apparently a wonderful track list is coming out as well, including
5214380	5222940	all sorts of fun stuff, Black Eyed Peas, Pump It, Destiny's Child, Bootylicious, DJ Jazzy
5222940	5231700	Jeff and the French Prince, Summertime, that's pretty awesome, Gwen Stefani, Hollaback Girl,
5231700	5240860	and let's see here, Luther Vandross, Never Too Much, OutKast, Idlewild, Blue, Don't You
5240860	5249260	Worry About Me, and Whitney Houston, Your Love Is My Love, among others.
5249260	5253700	And I knew it would take merely seconds for someone to make this comment, but a Hippolytus
5253700	5256060	in our chat room says, Black Eyed Peas is not R&B.
5256060	5260380	That would take five seconds for someone to say that.
5260380	5263220	Don't tell my mother about this game, because she loves Luther Vandross.
5263220	5264220	She really does.
5264220	5267240	And if you know my mother, she's...
5267240	5268300	I think she likes both.
5268300	5273900	I don't think Hollaback Girl is R&B either, but you know, whatever.
5273900	5274900	That's true too.
5274900	5275900	I don't know.
5275900	5276900	A little bit.
5276900	5277900	All right.
5277900	5283580	Anyway, let's go on to a brand new segment, which is going to be our last segment of part
5283580	5285940	A tonight.
5285940	5288580	We're going to actually make this kind of a regular thing, is that this will always
5288580	5293340	kind of be our bookend to part A, moving into part B, is a brand new segment here on Orange
5293340	5294340	Laundry Radio.
5294340	5295700	We've been promising it for weeks.
5295700	5296700	It's here.
5296700	5300340	It's Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.
5300340	5305380	But I have the same old music.
5305380	5308660	I know, because the chat room really liked the old music.
5308660	5311020	It didn't want to see it go away, so we had to keep it.
5311020	5313860	So Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
5313860	5321460	The Classic Game of the Week is Fantasy Zone, which is my second favorite video game ever.
5321460	5326020	Fantasy Zone is a game where you play as a little ship called the Oppa Oppa.
5326020	5328460	It's this little red ship with a window on it.
5328460	5332740	It has wings, but when it's on the ground, it walks.
5332740	5341580	And listen, the music has got the best music ever.
5341580	5344300	It plays a lot like Defender.
5344300	5345300	It is.
5345300	5346300	It's Chibi Defender, basically.
5346300	5347300	Anyway, you can keep reading.
5347300	5348300	I'm going to let this play in the background.
5348300	5358700	I just want to play a little bit of music in the chat room.
5358700	5359700	Good times.
5359700	5360700	I like how the ship has feet.
5360700	5364260	Yeah, when you're on the ground, the ship has feet, and it walks.
5364260	5367740	It's cute.
5367740	5370660	The Oppa Oppa actually was first in the Zillion anime.
5370660	5373180	I don't know if anyone's ever played Zillion.
5373180	5377300	Zillion was the game that they based the Zapper off of for the Master System.
5377300	5381440	But there were also other versions that came out.
5381440	5382440	There was...
5382440	5384180	And I actually have the other versions.
5384180	5389860	I have Fantasy Zone on Master System and Super Nintendo, Fantasy Zone 2 on both.
5389860	5390860	I have...
5390860	5393180	Now, Space Fantasy Zone was one that came out on...
5393180	5398580	Well, it was a prototype only that was supposed to be out on the TurboGrafx Duo.
5398580	5401980	And I have a burn of it, but I haven't actually sat down and played it yet.
5401980	5407220	And then there was a Super Fantasy Zone.
5407220	5413240	Also for anyone who's a fan of in-portrait and cast games, some of the enemies from Fantasy
5413240	5421620	Zone 2 were in the final boss for the game Sega Gaga, for anyone who can play that.
5421620	5423020	But it's a fun little game.
5423020	5429580	And also the Fantasy Zone is the same universe that Space Harrier was set in.
5429580	5437260	And you actually have a later level in Fantasy Zone that's the Space Harrier level.
5437260	5443220	Yes, currently our little ship, the Opa-Opa, is fighting a big tree that's spinning leaves.
5443220	5444220	A tree trunk.
5444220	5445220	But it's cute!
5445220	5446220	It's cute!
5446220	5447220	It's okay.
5447220	5451380	Well, in the Space Harrier level, you actually fight low-eye heads.
5451380	5454020	But also another thing.
5454020	5461620	For anyone who was collecting the Sega Ages 2900 collection, they redid the whole thing
5461620	5465220	in 3D, but it was still side-scrolling.
5465220	5471380	But when you did your bonus level where you have to go catch all these coins, it was in
5471380	5472380	first person.
5472380	5475220	So, Rob, you played Mike Robbie.
5475220	5476220	Yes.
5476220	5477220	It was kind of neat.
5477220	5483020	But it was probably one of the best Sega games ever.
5483020	5484020	I think.
5484020	5485020	Alright.
5485020	5490400	And you could also go in shops and buy, like, anvils.
5490400	5491400	And wings!
5491400	5492400	And fairy wings for your ship.
5492400	5496020	And you could buy wings and you could buy extra boosters and different types of rockets.
5496020	5499620	But I just like you buy this big thing that's like the one ton thing that they drop in the
5499620	5502100	Looney Tunes cartoons and just drop it on ships.
5502100	5503100	It was great.
5503100	5504100	Good times.
5504100	5510220	Alright, well, Fantasy Zone is the classic game of the week, so check it out at your
5510220	5515260	local swap meet or, you know, there's other ways you can go about finding a ROM of Fantasy
5515260	5516260	Zone.
5516260	5517260	But we can't talk about that on the show.
5517260	5518260	Two dollars on eBay.
5518260	5519260	Alright.
5519260	5522980	Well, that's going to bring to a close part A of our podcast, but fear not, there's plenty
5522980	5527360	more Orange Launch Radio to come, like it or not, in part B. And coming up tonight in
5527360	5532780	part B, since it is episode 250, we have to do one of our very favorite segments, Match
5532780	5533780	Game, coming up tonight.
5533780	5534780	That's right.
5534780	5535780	Applause.
5535780	5537660	The light is, our new applause light is flashing apparently.
5537660	5538660	Alright.
5538660	5540540	So the match game will be up in just a little bit.
5540540	5543540	We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this, which, by the way,
5543540	5545740	oh, I need to say one more thing about the show.
5545740	5549620	The show is now going to be released on, due to popular demand, instead of making it wait
5549620	5552620	until Wednesday, you now get part B on Tuesday on the feed.
5552620	5555620	I thought you were saying we're going to release it on Betamax.
5555620	5556620	Maybe we could, actually.
5556620	5557620	Dude, that would be cool.
5557620	5559380	We could actually find a working beta machine.
5559380	5561780	We have to go to the TV station to find that.
5561780	5564740	It'll be released on Laserdisc and beta.
5564740	5565740	Alright.
5565740	5570820	And hopefully we will try very hard to keep part B show tunes free.
5570820	5571820	Alright.
5571820	5572820	We'll see.
5572820	5573820	Maybe.
5573820	5577660	Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Launch Radio.
5577660	5582060	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
5582060	5583060	a week.
5583060	5596020	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
