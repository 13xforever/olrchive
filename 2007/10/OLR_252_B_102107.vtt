00:00.487 --> 00:05.571
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:05.892 --> 00:14.759
[SPEAKER_04]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.459 --> 00:19.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.623 --> 00:23.786
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, October the 21st, 2007.

00:25.067 --> 00:28.370
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, Orange Lounge Radio does tape live on Sunday nights.

00:28.963 --> 00:36.088
[SPEAKER_05]: and releases the live show in two parts, Part A and B. And you're listening to Part B right now, which means we've already taken care of the formalities.

00:36.528 --> 00:38.189
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get back to the gaming news.

00:39.270 --> 00:45.114
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, something we've been talking about for the last few weeks here is the Xbox 360 Arcade SKU.

00:45.154 --> 00:46.895
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't exist, but it actually does.

00:47.656 --> 00:54.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there's been some interesting proof for this, including someone actually buying one.

00:55.001 --> 00:56.882
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, duh.

00:57.483 --> 00:57.663
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

00:58.604 --> 01:03.265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is basically a core system now with a wireless controller.

01:03.565 --> 01:05.106
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have HDMI on it.

01:05.446 --> 01:14.908
[SPEAKER_06]: It will feature a 256 megabyte memory unit and a disc including five Xbox Live Arcade trial games, apparently.

01:15.308 --> 01:22.730
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom Boom Rocket, Feeding Frenzy, Luxor 2, and Pac-Man Championship and Uno.

01:22.870 --> 01:24.031
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking lame.

01:24.111 --> 01:25.471
[SPEAKER_06]: They're only trial games?

01:26.568 --> 01:26.768
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

01:48.563 --> 01:49.364
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:49.384 --> 01:51.586
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't really say what it's on there.

01:52.206 --> 01:55.249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe if Microsoft will actually acknowledge the existence of this.

01:55.289 --> 01:56.090
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you this much.

01:56.110 --> 02:01.754
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not supposed to say anything, but it's going to be fucking announced on the 23rd officially because that's the day it comes out.

02:01.774 --> 02:02.235
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's fine.

02:02.275 --> 02:03.756
[SPEAKER_05]: This podcast won't hit until the 23rd.

02:04.697 --> 02:06.478
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be officially announced on the 23rd.

02:06.899 --> 02:11.342
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, even after all this stuff, that they're still insisting on keeping it a fucking secret.

02:11.603 --> 02:14.485
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when people are leaking it out there, it's been purchased.

02:14.625 --> 02:15.406
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been out there.

02:16.090 --> 02:20.853
[SPEAKER_06]: Why they're still denying it's coming out, but they have a whole marketing plan behind it, how they're going to promote it and stuff.

02:21.153 --> 02:23.575
[SPEAKER_06]: So it will be officially announced on the 23rd.

02:23.595 --> 02:25.616
[SPEAKER_05]: What's so special about the 23rd?

02:26.737 --> 02:29.239
[SPEAKER_06]: It's whenever they're fucking... It's when this is coming out.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.140
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

02:31.180 --> 02:33.121
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it line up with an expo or something?

02:33.381 --> 02:35.242
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just whenever they feel like it.

02:35.463 --> 02:36.083
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

02:37.084 --> 02:44.128
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess, I think also at the same time, that's when the Elite console, or the bundle that they're doing for the holidays is coming out as well.

02:44.248 --> 02:44.408
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

02:46.508 --> 02:50.976
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it.

02:51.898 --> 02:53.100
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a huge surprise.

02:54.282 --> 02:57.007
[SPEAKER_06]: It was totally not coming out or anything.

02:59.011 --> 03:05.753
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to the rumor camp, and you know, most Microsoft rumors do end up being true, so this could be something that does come to light.

03:06.113 --> 03:06.693
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I don't know.

03:06.833 --> 03:08.333
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a little bit far-fetched for me.

03:09.114 --> 03:10.754
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to mention, sorry, real quick.

03:11.414 --> 03:12.974
[SPEAKER_06]: It was confirmed by Microsoft.

03:12.994 --> 03:15.975
[SPEAKER_06]: They did confirm that it is, you know, coming.

03:16.075 --> 03:18.136
[SPEAKER_06]: They just never said anything else beyond that.

03:18.256 --> 03:20.256
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're like, you just need to wait for details.

03:20.696 --> 03:24.877
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, Arcade for us is the ability to bring in a new set of audiences.

03:24.897 --> 03:27.298
[SPEAKER_06]: They're probably a little bit more casually focused.

03:28.101 --> 03:32.726
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're looking for a new family experience and they're more price focused.

03:32.806 --> 03:38.912
[SPEAKER_06]: Robbie Bach told Financial Times, marketing Microsoft's first public comments about the new SKU.

03:38.932 --> 03:42.836
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, they didn't really say what was included with it or any of the details and stuff.

03:42.896 --> 03:51.484
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, 23rd, all this will be finally officially announced and our Microsoft rep can finally calm down a little bit.

03:52.116 --> 04:00.118
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this will be something that could bring people in, and that is combining the HD DVD player and the Xbox 360.

04:00.158 --> 04:02.738
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us have kind of wondered, why hasn't this been done already?

04:03.098 --> 04:11.300
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there are rumors going around that Toshiba is actually teaming up with Microsoft to be making an actual HD DVD slash Xbox 360.

04:11.340 --> 04:19.262
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I hear this, my mind kind of goes to, you remember the Panasonic Q, I think it was called, that was the GameCube slash DVD player that you could only get in Japan?

04:19.582 --> 04:20.822
[SPEAKER_05]: Duel HD Tuners with a Program Guide

04:46.028 --> 04:54.777
[SPEAKER_05]: An MP3 player dock and possibly also a 40-inch TV to come with it or sold separately that will dock the actual 360.

04:54.897 --> 04:56.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a funny thought.

04:56.518 --> 05:03.165
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I remember way back when they were talking about TVs that would have the original Xbox integrated into them.

05:03.966 --> 05:04.727
[SPEAKER_06]: and something like this.

05:05.207 --> 05:06.828
[SPEAKER_06]: How much do you want to bet this isn't actually a 360?

05:07.568 --> 05:13.271
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Toshiba HD DVD player that will also play Xbox 360 games.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.452
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of what the Panasonic Q was, right?

05:15.492 --> 05:17.633
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just a DVD player that would also play GameCube games.

05:18.314 --> 05:18.934
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of cool.

05:19.795 --> 05:24.257
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, here's why folks are getting all speculative about this.

05:24.617 --> 05:31.241
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently an unnamed or unknown Toshiba rep actually said, an Xbox with a built-in DVD drive is critical.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.122
[SPEAKER_05]: They and we are working on it.

05:33.483 --> 05:36.084
[SPEAKER_05]: It also has to be more than a gaming machine.

05:36.424 --> 05:37.885
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft recognizes this.

05:38.266 --> 05:41.968
[SPEAKER_05]: A version of the device may also be sold under the Toshiba brand name.

05:45.530 --> 05:46.371
[SPEAKER_02]: That would make sense.

05:46.391 --> 05:48.312
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, didn't we have a bajillion different versions of the CD-i?

05:49.640 --> 05:51.503
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose.

05:51.963 --> 06:00.854
[SPEAKER_05]: It is kind of interesting because I don't think we've seen anything really like this since the Panasonic Q. And even then, the Panasonic Q wasn't even sold here.

06:01.135 --> 06:02.957
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the thing too about that.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.881
[SPEAKER_06]: That way, if it is branded under the Toshiba name,

06:06.388 --> 06:07.088
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

06:30.460 --> 06:36.164
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope the HD DVD ends up winning out, because otherwise that's going to be a big pile of useless crap.

06:36.244 --> 06:42.209
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least there's quite a few movies already available, including Heroes Season 1, which I still need to buy on HD DVD.

06:42.749 --> 06:45.191
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really care about HD DVD at all, though.

06:46.271 --> 06:47.192
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Blu-ray player.

06:48.173 --> 06:48.893
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, lady.

06:50.274 --> 06:56.779
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in other HD DVD news, you're also going to be given five...

06:57.443 --> 07:00.525
[SPEAKER_02]: Free movies if you buy the Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on.

07:01.005 --> 07:16.854
[SPEAKER_02]: You can choose from Serenity, which is like the best movie ever, The Chronicles of Riddick, Hulk, Children of Men, The Fast and the Furious, Tokyo Drift, Troy, Full Metal Jacket, yeah, Corpse Bride, The Prestige, Swordfish, Black Rain, Dreamgirls, and World Trade Center.

07:17.695 --> 07:22.898
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you claim this is you fill out a form, send in a copy of your barcode,

07:23.872 --> 07:26.553
[SPEAKER_02]: and Microsoft will send you your stuff within 28 days.

07:52.557 --> 07:54.298
[SPEAKER_05]: I can understand how the iPhone folks feel.

07:54.718 --> 07:55.158
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

07:55.238 --> 07:58.159
[SPEAKER_05]: Serenity is actually a movie I still need to get on HD DVD.

07:58.299 --> 08:00.079
[SPEAKER_05]: I somehow don't have it yet.

08:00.099 --> 08:01.680
[SPEAKER_06]: That's at Christmas, by the way.

08:02.460 --> 08:19.725
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, it's kind of funny that you mentioned Heroes earlier because I believe that Best Buy is doing a thing right now where you can get a HD DVD add-on for the 360 and get a free copy of the Heroes HD DVD set, including also those five extra DVDs that you can mail away for.

08:19.925 --> 08:21.726
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just missed out on everything, didn't I?

08:22.146 --> 08:22.286
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

08:22.725 --> 08:25.646
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:50.201 --> 08:53.762
[SPEAKER_06]: The Weaver Girl, Shopping Spree, and High Calorie Katamari.

08:54.782 --> 09:03.563
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically what these are, the Milky Way Constellation has you roll up 88 constellations to create a new Milky Way.

09:04.304 --> 09:10.085
[SPEAKER_06]: The Weaver Girl, you roll up a huge ball of yarn and string to create Vega, the Weaver Girl.

09:10.725 --> 09:14.585
[SPEAKER_06]: And Shopping Spree, make a space station but be thrifty about it.

09:15.245 --> 09:18.046
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess it sounds like an offshoot of a Katamari mission from

09:18.826 --> 09:23.470
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the previous games where the value of items are collected and taken into account.

09:23.910 --> 09:28.433
[SPEAKER_06]: And High Calorie Katamari, Feed Cetus the Whale, Roll Up Lots of Food.

09:28.753 --> 09:33.637
[SPEAKER_06]: And that reminds me a little bit of the one from We Love Katamari where you roll the sumo wrestler around.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.018
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that was cool.

09:36.459 --> 09:39.021
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are available right now in Asia and Japan.

09:39.141 --> 09:40.082
[SPEAKER_06]: No word on the U.S.

09:40.182 --> 09:43.284
[SPEAKER_06]: yet, but I'm sure that they'll be coming soon.

09:43.680 --> 09:44.720
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:06.813 --> 10:08.834
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it be known that OLR knows how to forgive.

10:09.214 --> 10:10.474
[SPEAKER_05]: I went out and bought the game anyway.

10:10.974 --> 10:15.656
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you look up forgiveness in the dictionary and see our picture next to it, you'll understand why.

10:16.116 --> 10:16.616
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, don't worry.

10:16.736 --> 10:17.497
[SPEAKER_06]: I know how to forgive.

10:17.637 --> 10:18.977
[SPEAKER_06]: I went out and got the game as well.

10:19.357 --> 10:19.557
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

10:19.737 --> 10:20.478
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you did.

10:21.198 --> 10:21.498
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

10:23.129 --> 10:23.889
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:44.818 --> 10:45.939
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:08.171 --> 11:09.714
[SPEAKER_05]: Great track record with that game.

11:09.915 --> 11:10.737
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

11:10.837 --> 11:15.087
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in time for the premiere of Razor, Battlestar Galactica Razor.

11:15.107 --> 11:16.550
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the little miniseries about...

11:17.569 --> 11:20.330
[SPEAKER_05]: The Pegasus will be debuting November 24th.

11:21.670 --> 11:31.053
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, for those folks that are asking how much the game will cost, such as JAP28 is asking in our chat room, $20 on the PC, $800 Microsoft Points, or $10 on Xbox Live Arcade.

11:31.093 --> 11:33.153
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get it a day earlier on PCs, October 23rd.

11:33.173 --> 11:33.153
$20.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.154
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too shabby.

11:44.523 --> 11:47.544
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little bit of joy, even though I'm probably not going to bother buying the game.

11:49.544 --> 11:55.245
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega Superstar Tennis is going to have, of course, a bunch of different Sega characters in it.

11:56.005 --> 11:57.026
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Sonic.

11:57.186 --> 12:00.186
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Amigo from Samba de Amigo, which I think is pretty cool.

12:00.766 --> 12:01.386
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh la la.

12:02.827 --> 12:05.347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being worked on by Sumo Digital.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.768
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing anything else about who else is going to be in it.

12:09.941 --> 12:14.983
[SPEAKER_02]: or a date for that matter, but we do have it on PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Nintendo DS.

12:15.744 --> 12:19.885
[SPEAKER_05]: Please tell me that every time Ulala hits the ball, she'll go, Chew!

12:20.485 --> 12:20.886
[SPEAKER_05]: Chew!

12:21.406 --> 12:21.826
[SPEAKER_05]: Chew!

12:23.026 --> 12:23.547
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be good.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.547
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that play Space Channel 5, that's fine.

12:25.608 --> 12:29.709
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like what they mentioned on Kotaku, that they want to see characters from House of the Dead and Altered Beast.

12:29.829 --> 12:30.389
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.

12:30.409 --> 12:31.170
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of rad.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.210
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play as a zombie.

12:33.491 --> 12:34.271
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd just be awesome.

12:35.143 --> 12:37.004
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like, when you win, you eat the other person?

12:37.244 --> 12:39.104
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing Zombie Tennis, the game.

12:39.144 --> 12:40.085
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of fun.

12:41.565 --> 12:41.925
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

12:41.965 --> 12:42.866
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you listening, Sega?

12:43.566 --> 12:44.066
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it happen.

12:45.107 --> 12:46.187
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's going to happen.

12:46.387 --> 12:47.888
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so either, but it's kind of a dream.

12:48.288 --> 13:02.333
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, one thing that is happening, though, and also on the 23rd, will be Guitar Hero music, available for download, at least a digital download, and including music from Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 2, and Guitar Hero Encore Rock the 80s.

13:03.508 --> 13:09.051
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be available from Wave Group and I guess affiliating with other stuff.

13:10.032 --> 13:16.355
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll be available, I guess, across such download sites as AOL, iTunes, Napster, Rhapsody, and Yahoo.

13:17.736 --> 13:20.857
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody told me there's actually a DDR soundtrack on iTunes now for Supernova 2.

13:20.937 --> 13:21.698
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know that.

13:22.318 --> 13:22.858
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of neat.

13:23.379 --> 13:24.379
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know either, so.

13:24.439 --> 13:31.243
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to have our own little playlist uploaded on iTunes that had all the DDR music from the games and where they could be found on iTunes, but

13:31.636 --> 13:32.557
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:56.192 --> 13:59.815
[SPEAKER_05]: and hopefully the music won't stop like E4ALL did.

14:00.235 --> 14:03.497
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody forgot to pay the bill at E4ALL and the power got shut off.

14:04.078 --> 14:04.658
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just kidding.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.679
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the reason why.

14:05.799 --> 14:13.884
[SPEAKER_05]: But on Friday night at about 7 o'clock, E4ALL came to a very abrupt end because the lights went out.

14:14.865 --> 14:18.588
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of folks were watching a match between Fatality.

14:19.228 --> 14:24.792
[SPEAKER_05]: He was playing Quake 4 and some other folks were playing Super Mario Galaxy and some of the other games that were available there.

14:25.291 --> 14:40.255
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the power shut off on the whole right half of South Hall and that would have been where the Nintendo and the EA booths were which were pretty much the main reasons why people were going to the show right there between those two and so they decided to end the show at that point.

14:40.975 --> 14:46.216
[SPEAKER_05]: The staff quickly escorted everybody out of the convention hall because when the power goes out that's actually not safe.

14:47.076 --> 14:48.096
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a safety hazard.

14:48.436 --> 14:48.917
[SPEAKER_04]: Money back!

14:48.957 --> 14:49.177
[SPEAKER_04]: Refund!

14:51.062 --> 14:54.145
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but wasn't the show going to close at like 8 anyway?

14:54.225 --> 14:59.191
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I don't remember the hours for the show, but I seem to recall it was going to close kind of early anyway.

14:59.931 --> 15:03.155
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, this isn't the first time something like this has happened at the convention center.

15:03.635 --> 15:06.678
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been some previous E3s where similar things have happened.

15:07.159 --> 15:14.246
[SPEAKER_05]: But it just kind of sucks that it's happening for E2E4ALL when they've been taking a lot of crap.

15:14.724 --> 15:21.687
[SPEAKER_05]: from various game blogs and stuff for not being up to the same level that many of us remember with the big E3 expos.

15:22.147 --> 15:26.149
[SPEAKER_05]: So this doesn't help them try to get past that.

15:26.229 --> 15:26.689
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

15:28.370 --> 15:29.490
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, E4ALL.

15:30.871 --> 15:31.611
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.512
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just saying that.

15:33.852 --> 15:34.413
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I am.

15:37.510 --> 15:41.471
[SPEAKER_02]: The PS3 is actually seeing an increase in sales in Europe now.

15:42.371 --> 15:44.012
[SPEAKER_02]: They have gone up by 178%.

15:44.952 --> 15:49.833
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

15:52.774 --> 15:58.056
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's with the introduction of the 60GB bundle and the new 40GB unit that came out.

15:59.036 --> 16:00.777
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there a price drop that just went in there?

16:00.857 --> 16:03.057
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, there was a price drop that happened too recently.

16:03.458 --> 16:04.658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, there was the price drop.

16:05.123 --> 16:20.428
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm sure there may be... They also were saying that the software sales increased with Resistance Fall of Man actually taking a rise in its chart status and Heavenly Sword and Motorstorm.

16:21.008 --> 16:27.891
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are kind of the must-have PS3 games at this point, so not too surprising that folks getting their new PS3s are picking up those games.

16:28.111 --> 16:29.831
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense to me.

16:31.712 --> 16:32.212
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways...

16:32.868 --> 16:37.212
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, they totally announced the 4D egg system for the US.

16:37.832 --> 16:39.373
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so shocked.

16:40.114 --> 16:42.036
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not realize that that was coming.

16:42.836 --> 16:43.677
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crap.

16:44.458 --> 16:45.619
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the worst liar ever.

16:45.639 --> 16:46.659
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy crap.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.281
[SPEAKER_06]: So much enthusiasm.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.423
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so Sony finally announced this system.

16:51.804 --> 16:55.647
[SPEAKER_06]: They've really done a great job of keeping it under wraps.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.048
[SPEAKER_06]: No one knew anything about it.

16:57.848 --> 17:00.189
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently, yeah, it's coming out now, November 2nd.

17:00.209 --> 17:04.369
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll officially be $400 US for $399.99, however you want to look at it.

17:05.250 --> 17:10.091
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, there is no, you know, backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 games.

17:10.831 --> 17:14.792
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the same time, they've also dropped down the 80-gig system to $499.99.

17:14.972 --> 17:15.452
[SPEAKER_06]: So $100 cheaper.

17:15.472 --> 17:15.652
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome!

17:22.406 --> 17:22.987
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

17:43.480 --> 17:47.821
[SPEAKER_05]: is that this has nothing to do with reducing Sony's cost of manufacturing.

17:47.841 --> 17:54.142
[SPEAKER_05]: People would go and speculate that, oh, they had to fit a whole PlayStation 2 in the PlayStation 3, so taking that out saves them money.

17:54.682 --> 17:54.902
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

17:55.543 --> 18:05.104
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why they did this was, quote, encouraging buyers of the entry-level PlayStation 3 to purchase more games designed specifically for the new system.

18:06.345 --> 18:07.625
[SPEAKER_06]: You are an idiot.

18:08.550 --> 18:09.230
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

18:10.071 --> 18:11.491
[SPEAKER_05]: That was horrible.

18:39.107 --> 18:39.687
[SPEAKER_06]: C'mon!

18:40.768 --> 18:41.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Who let him talk?

18:41.709 --> 18:43.130
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, who let him talk?

18:43.770 --> 18:45.932
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Piker Uno in our chatroom would agree with you.

18:45.972 --> 18:50.915
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.orange.radio.com Piker Uno says, Sony PR, please shut the fuck up.

18:51.355 --> 18:51.775
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

18:51.836 --> 18:52.776
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, please, please.

18:52.856 --> 18:53.597
[SPEAKER_06]: C'mon!

18:54.397 --> 18:55.378
[SPEAKER_06]: Who let him talk?

18:55.738 --> 18:56.519
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I wanted to know.

18:56.539 --> 18:59.341
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you don't... I'm sorry.

18:59.661 --> 19:04.984
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to be as positive as I can with these guys, but they're really making it tough on me.

19:05.465 --> 19:06.625
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

19:06.685 --> 19:07.246
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

19:08.231 --> 19:18.094
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they just came out the week before and said, okay, well, the reason why is because we removed these chips and we removed these chips so that we can cut the price a little bit so that we can drop the price of the system.

19:18.234 --> 19:20.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that makes sense and logic there.

19:20.874 --> 19:26.236
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're just fucking with us and just removing it because you want to sell some more PlayStation 3 games...

19:26.776 --> 19:27.816
[SPEAKER_06]: Well then, fuck you.

19:27.956 --> 19:28.676
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

19:29.357 --> 19:31.537
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting thought in our chat room.

19:32.277 --> 19:39.899
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob Babak says in our chat room, or it could be that Sony wants you to buy backwards compatibility from the PlayStation Network.

19:41.279 --> 19:42.339
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wouldn't that be mean?

19:43.539 --> 19:45.040
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really mean if that's true.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.340
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, but they have said it's software-based.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.181
[SPEAKER_05]: That is definitely plausible.

19:49.261 --> 19:51.101
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because it's software-based for the PlayStation 1.

19:52.547 --> 20:00.630
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was... They had what it was, they had a chip that was running the graphics stuff for the PlayStation 2, but the motion engine was software based.

20:01.310 --> 20:08.833
[SPEAKER_05]: So unless they completely rewrote it to... But then didn't they get rid of, like in the European ones, didn't they get rid of that and replace it with software?

20:08.933 --> 20:13.974
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they got rid of one of the two chips, but this 40 gig system has zero of the two chips.

20:14.474 --> 20:16.015
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why it can't run anything.

20:17.272 --> 20:19.413
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all fucked up, however you look at it.

20:19.813 --> 20:23.715
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they're going to make you buy backwards compatibility later on, that's also fucked up.

20:24.836 --> 20:28.897
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just asking for Microsoft to just come back at you with some PR spin on it.

20:28.977 --> 20:29.738
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

20:30.278 --> 20:31.739
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I bought mine when I did.

20:32.079 --> 20:35.740
[SPEAKER_05]: Some days I want to go, just cut your losses and let's hear about PlayStation 4.

20:38.942 --> 20:39.742
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting harder.

20:39.842 --> 20:42.583
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Sony fanboys, but at the same time, I'm not.

20:43.264 --> 20:46.225
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, they just don't

20:48.614 --> 20:50.956
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't make a good case right about now, you know what I mean?

20:50.996 --> 20:53.618
[SPEAKER_05]: They just keep shooting themselves in the foot over and over and over.

20:53.658 --> 20:54.538
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing.

20:54.758 --> 21:01.963
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, for the last few weeks, I've been really questioning whether I want to get Ratchet & Clank Future because I have it paid for.

21:01.983 --> 21:05.365
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like, maybe I want something else instead.

21:05.425 --> 21:07.267
[SPEAKER_06]: I can buy a 360 game with that or something.

21:07.927 --> 21:11.269
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, I don't know.

21:11.409 --> 21:15.532
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been downloading stuff off the Japanese PlayStation Network.

21:15.947 --> 21:17.608
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually have some stuff to download on there.

21:18.948 --> 21:22.549
[SPEAKER_05]: On the bright side, maybe the price will drop again before Final Fantasy XIII comes out.

21:23.290 --> 21:23.710
[SPEAKER_05]: I can dream.

21:23.990 --> 21:24.430
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

21:24.670 --> 21:25.610
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, seriously.

21:25.850 --> 21:26.111
[SPEAKER_02]: When?

21:27.731 --> 21:28.211
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what?

21:28.231 --> 21:33.553
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XIII will probably come out in Japan late next year, in 2009 at the earliest.

21:33.573 --> 21:34.994
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be lucky if it comes out next year.

21:35.434 --> 21:35.674
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

21:35.774 --> 21:36.594
[SPEAKER_06]: You are lucky.

21:36.794 --> 21:38.615
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.316
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe there will be another price drop before then.

21:40.356 --> 21:40.636
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

21:41.056 --> 21:41.336
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

21:41.436 --> 21:41.796
[SPEAKER_05]: Me neither.

21:42.056 --> 21:43.937
[SPEAKER_05]: I got stuff to play on other systems meanwhile.

21:43.997 --> 21:44.317
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

21:46.021 --> 21:49.703
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least the few things are going to be on PlayStation Network.

21:49.743 --> 21:51.664
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Flow and Warhawk.

21:51.804 --> 21:52.985
[SPEAKER_02]: Flow is spelled with a zero.

21:54.126 --> 21:54.626
[SPEAKER_02]: It's leet.

21:55.707 --> 21:57.087
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's the way the game is.

21:57.888 --> 21:57.968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

21:58.328 --> 22:00.349
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks kind of electroplankton-y.

22:01.230 --> 22:02.651
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you saying the game is a zero?

22:03.151 --> 22:03.891
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I like the game.

22:04.031 --> 22:04.692
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought the game.

22:04.852 --> 22:07.173
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only game I've bought from PlayStation Network.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.915
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, these are expansions that are going to be out for there.

22:11.072 --> 22:16.436
[SPEAKER_02]: The Flow expansion is going to have a multiplayer mode and a new playable creature.

22:17.557 --> 22:21.841
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Warhawk is going to be another dropship.

22:23.302 --> 22:25.123
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can pick up and relocate ground vehicles.

22:25.684 --> 22:27.445
[SPEAKER_05]: Multiplayer on Flow could be interesting.

22:27.946 --> 22:29.647
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though wasn't Flow more of like a...

22:30.231 --> 22:31.711
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something you play.

22:32.272 --> 22:33.012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ambient.

22:56.767 --> 22:57.047
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

22:57.067 --> 23:00.428
[SPEAKER_05]: These minimalist games, though, sometimes are extremely popular.

23:00.448 --> 23:06.209
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think about it, every Xen Extra Extreme, which I was talking about earlier, there's one button in the game to blow up your ship.

23:06.390 --> 23:06.830
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

23:06.990 --> 23:10.231
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't have a problem with that game.

23:10.371 --> 23:12.051
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I bought Flow.

23:12.731 --> 23:13.471
[SPEAKER_06]: That says a lot.

23:13.711 --> 23:17.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Because buying stuff off of the PlayStation Network is a bitch.

23:17.372 --> 23:18.393
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't like doing it.

23:18.433 --> 23:18.473
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

23:21.694 --> 23:26.936
[SPEAKER_05]: Kiki in our chatroom says, screw Flow, get Everyday Shooter, which is a game I've heard good things about.

23:26.976 --> 23:30.276
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Everyday Shooter wasn't available when Flow first became available.

23:30.296 --> 23:34.838
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I've thought about buying that game too, because that looks good.

23:35.978 --> 23:43.700
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, another game, as I mentioned earlier, that I tried out, and it is available on the Japanese PlayStation Network, so if you don't have a Japanese account,

23:44.861 --> 23:48.023
[SPEAKER_06]: Create one, download it, and then you can play it on any of your accounts.

23:48.123 --> 23:51.165
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, the demo.

23:51.966 --> 23:54.127
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a demo for a demo, I guess.

23:54.608 --> 23:57.229
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a demo for a demo game that you're going to have to buy or something like that.

23:57.570 --> 24:00.992
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, it features, you know, a few cards.

24:01.052 --> 24:07.977
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe there's like, I want to say like six cards to choose from or something in the very beginning.

24:09.718 --> 24:14.241
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's going to be just, you know, single player stuff, no online stuff.

24:16.214 --> 24:17.295
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cool looking game.

24:17.375 --> 24:18.516
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's like one track.

24:19.497 --> 24:20.858
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely worth checking out.

24:21.799 --> 24:24.101
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, though, when this comes out, I wouldn't buy it.

24:24.742 --> 24:28.085
[SPEAKER_06]: But, hey, if you love Gran Turismo, get your hands on this.

24:28.105 --> 24:29.906
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the full game when it's released?

24:30.527 --> 24:31.067
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't buy it.

24:32.809 --> 24:34.971
[SPEAKER_06]: They're talking $40 for the full game.

24:35.371 --> 24:35.711
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that.

24:35.791 --> 24:38.334
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll wait for the real game to come out and pay like $20 more.

24:38.794 --> 24:39.795
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what's the point?

24:40.967 --> 24:53.112
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, the other thing too is make sure you download Gran Turismo HD if it's even still available on the PlayStation Network because I know that they're taking that down soon when 5 comes out.

24:54.712 --> 24:55.733
[SPEAKER_06]: But definitely worth checking it out.

24:55.813 --> 24:56.773
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cool looking game.

24:57.353 --> 24:58.374
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, I wouldn't buy it.

24:58.994 --> 24:59.194
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

24:59.854 --> 25:04.236
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, very interesting comment coming out of the San Jose Mercury News.

25:05.056 --> 25:09.678
[SPEAKER_05]: Dean Takahashi is a reporter for the Mercury News and talks often about video games.

25:10.336 --> 25:29.809
[SPEAKER_05]: and he was writing earlier this week about the latest sales number and also said this quote quote one piece of news that came out this week was that Sony pleaded with third-party developers not to abandon its struggling platform that change in attitude is a marked difference compared to the arrogance of past years

25:30.478 --> 25:35.783
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting to think that Sony could be on its knees begging people not to leave right now.

25:35.803 --> 25:38.525
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of makes me go, I wonder who's thinking of jumping ship right now.

25:38.605 --> 25:39.826
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it makes sense.

25:39.846 --> 25:41.347
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you think about it, I mean, look at it.

25:41.367 --> 25:52.397
[SPEAKER_06]: The system has the least amount of, as far as, I hate calling it next gen, but as far as the next gen platforms, it has the least market share, at least in the U.S., and

25:53.157 --> 25:54.158
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

26:20.171 --> 26:30.679
[SPEAKER_05]: said the PlayStation 3 was a waste of everyone's time and could be indicating why folks are starting to jump ship and Sony's begging people to stay around.

26:30.819 --> 26:35.722
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which, Half-Life 2, The Orange Box, and PlayStation 3 not coming out until December now.

26:37.344 --> 26:46.310
[SPEAKER_05]: And as some folks are speculating, if at all, if you keep getting delay, delay, delay, eventually you might start seeing canceled, canceled, canceled.

26:46.751 --> 26:48.572
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this holiday season could...

26:49.335 --> 26:50.200
[SPEAKER_05]: Make or Break Sony.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.491
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't want to sound all like finalists here, but

26:52.898 --> 27:03.221
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if Sony doesn't manage to sell through a lot of consoles, it's interesting because Extrofer and I, for those who didn't hear the bonus segment tonight, Extrofer and I drove to Disneyland together and we were talking about game stuff.

27:03.241 --> 27:09.003
[SPEAKER_05]: He was talking about how he works at a large retail chain right now that sells electronics as part of it.

27:09.383 --> 27:14.944
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says, you know, he's like, I'm not biased, but I'm sitting there and I'm watching.

27:15.004 --> 27:20.406
[SPEAKER_05]: We are selling quite a few Xbox 360, tons of Wii's I have never seen.

27:21.144 --> 27:28.012
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, keep in mind, he works overnights, but he sees these systems go, even in the overnight shifts, and he says, I have never seen us sell a PlayStation 3.

27:28.112 --> 27:32.016
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Walmart's kind of a weird demographic.

27:32.637 --> 27:35.240
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't think people go buy PlayStation 3s there.

27:36.721 --> 27:39.064
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing... I mean, seriously, though...

27:40.629 --> 27:42.830
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just taking it right now as to date.

27:42.850 --> 27:49.034
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was talking to you about this before the show started because kind of going back to the whole I have judgment bet that we have right now.

27:49.154 --> 28:02.582
[SPEAKER_06]: So far, and I was looking at the numbers after the MPD group reported on for September, year to date, the PlayStation 3, there's not been a game that's sold over 400,000 units in the United States, which isn't that great.

28:02.863 --> 28:09.326
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when you consider like Halo sold, you know, 2 million units and there's a bunch of other games that have sold millions of units and stuff like that.

28:10.007 --> 28:10.067
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

28:11.198 --> 28:16.923
[SPEAKER_06]: 300,000 or 335,000 if I remember correctly was for Resistance Fallen Man.

28:18.944 --> 28:19.505
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that good.

28:19.965 --> 28:23.848
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know people are waiting for Metal Gear Solid 4, which is going to be an awesome game.

28:24.509 --> 28:27.311
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will be probably a must-have game for the PlayStation 3.

28:27.411 --> 28:37.319
[SPEAKER_06]: It may help them sell some units, but I think a lot of people, and hope to God that they don't announce that there's going to be an Xbox 360 version for that around the same time,

28:39.364 --> 28:45.387
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that may sell some units for them, but at the same time, they're going to lose out this holiday, for sure.

28:45.927 --> 28:46.748
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a fact.

28:47.548 --> 28:52.331
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the time that all these good games come around, it's going to be too late.

28:52.991 --> 28:53.911
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really what it's going to be.

28:55.932 --> 29:01.495
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope they make it, because I'd like to see all three consoles doing good, but I don't know.

29:03.376 --> 29:03.716
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

29:04.597 --> 29:04.877
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

29:05.934 --> 29:09.095
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yet again, another Sony debate here on the program.

29:09.155 --> 29:11.156
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we love to always get your perspective.

29:11.176 --> 29:13.696
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's some people that feel very differently about this whole issue.

29:14.316 --> 29:17.297
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to express your opinion.

29:17.878 --> 29:24.319
[SPEAKER_05]: And every week here on the program, we like to read your emails here on the program and respond to them, if appropriate.

29:24.900 --> 29:30.261
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura likes to read the emails at Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com in our Mailbag segment.

29:36.596 --> 29:40.738
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I understand this week, not a lot of people expressing their opinions, huh?

29:41.358 --> 29:41.618
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

29:42.098 --> 29:43.539
[SPEAKER_05]: That's too bad.

29:43.879 --> 29:50.242
[SPEAKER_02]: First email says, Hey, I'd really like the new segment, and I think it's fun to reminisce on old but great games.

29:50.782 --> 29:56.565
[SPEAKER_02]: I would actually like to request a game to be featured in this segment, Riftstar for the Sega Genesis.

29:57.125 --> 29:59.386
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my all-time favorites.

29:59.486 --> 29:59.706
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

29:59.806 --> 30:00.507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from Osfer.

30:02.307 --> 30:02.968
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe one day.

30:04.408 --> 30:05.949
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really play it that much.

30:06.889 --> 30:08.029
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe now's the time to start.

30:08.549 --> 30:12.270
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have a game picked up for next week, although it's really, really, really obscure.

30:12.790 --> 30:14.211
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens when you're out in November?

30:14.271 --> 30:15.811
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean Loki and I get to pick some games?

30:16.011 --> 30:16.271
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

30:17.872 --> 30:27.914
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'll go ahead and tell you the one I thought about doing next week that I'm not going to do was Kaze No Regret, the real sound game that came out on the Saturn that was sound only, and you got a packet of seeds with it.

30:29.254 --> 30:31.135
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to be seeing nothing but Sega games?

30:31.395 --> 30:31.515
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

30:31.795 --> 30:32.235
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, good.

30:34.008 --> 30:36.910
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is going to be on vacation a couple weeks in November

31:04.256 --> 31:05.777
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

31:06.318 --> 31:13.504
[SPEAKER_02]: The last email is, Dear OLR, this is a theory that has been floating around the internets for some time, the third console curse.

31:14.745 --> 31:22.031
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this theory states that every third console by every leading publisher will ultimately fail or do significantly less better than its predecessor.

31:22.491 --> 31:23.091
[SPEAKER_02]: Just think about it.

31:23.111 --> 31:25.774
[SPEAKER_02]: The Atari 5200 was Atari's third system and it failed.

31:25.894 --> 31:26.274
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it didn't.

31:26.886 --> 31:32.788
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sega Saturn was Sega's third home system, and it slowly died because producing its motherboard was so expensive.

31:33.768 --> 31:35.608
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they didn't really support it very well in the U.S.

31:36.289 --> 31:41.950
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nintendo 64 did not fare well due to Sony's more powerful system and CD-based media.

31:42.070 --> 31:42.490
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

31:43.151 --> 31:47.972
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, Sony and its PlayStation 3, which I need not explain, especially since we just went over it.

31:48.860 --> 31:55.525
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the N64 and Saturn were pretty awesome systems, you can't help but say they did fail to their rival systems in terms of sales.

31:56.246 --> 32:00.189
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that this argument has no base whatsoever, but I just wanted to throw this out.

32:02.231 --> 32:07.415
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, the Saturn was not the third system.

32:08.235 --> 32:09.696
[SPEAKER_06]: The Saturn was the master system.

32:09.736 --> 32:16.562
[SPEAKER_02]: Master system, Genesis, Sega CD, 32X, and then this... Well, 32X I wouldn't really call a system.

32:16.602 --> 32:17.522
[SPEAKER_06]: It was more of an add-on.

32:17.563 --> 32:17.963
[SPEAKER_06]: But if...

32:18.539 --> 32:19.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Still, it's not 13th.

32:19.880 --> 32:20.360
[SPEAKER_02]: Or 5th.

32:21.341 --> 32:22.801
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that doesn't really count.

32:25.243 --> 32:25.583
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

32:25.683 --> 32:27.644
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of want to say something controversial.

32:27.764 --> 32:28.244
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

32:28.405 --> 32:29.825
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you why they all failed.

32:30.005 --> 32:32.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they all appeared on the cover of Madden NFL.

32:32.847 --> 32:34.368
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they all failed.

32:35.313 --> 32:41.056
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the controversial thing I want to say, our emailer says that Nintendo 64 was a good system with the Saturn.

32:41.136 --> 32:41.656
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree.

32:41.676 --> 32:43.557
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that Nintendo 64 was a good system.

32:43.657 --> 32:44.317
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was not.

32:44.497 --> 32:45.498
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not a good system.

32:46.338 --> 32:51.360
[SPEAKER_05]: The critical flaw they made in the system was that they refused to go to CD.

32:51.900 --> 32:56.162
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one decision that fucking killed them.

32:56.783 --> 33:01.205
[SPEAKER_05]: Did developers manage to make great games with a mediocre system?

33:01.465 --> 33:01.705
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.761
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you go to the GameCube.

33:04.801 --> 33:14.589
[SPEAKER_05]: The GameCube wasn't a bad system, but the GameCube also made some key mistakes that I think make the GameCube not so great a system, honestly.

33:14.629 --> 33:28.600
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there's Nintendo fanboys that are going to have their pitchfork and torches, but Nintendo 64, I think, made some key mistakes, and that was it didn't go online, it didn't play DVDs, which at the time that it came out was really an essential thing that the competitors had going.

33:29.238 --> 33:33.842
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I do think the Wii is a great idea and a great system, and it's nice to see Nintendo kind of go in a different direction.

33:33.862 --> 33:36.624
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would argue Nintendo 64 was not a good system.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.526
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean the Nintendo GameCube?

33:39.827 --> 33:40.047
[SPEAKER_05]: Both.

33:40.488 --> 33:42.109
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

33:43.410 --> 33:43.731
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

33:44.111 --> 33:52.879
[SPEAKER_06]: Just they really – hopefully with the Wii, I hate going back – go online, Nintendo.

33:53.159 --> 33:53.980
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, go online.

33:54.000 --> 33:54.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Go online.

33:56.361 --> 34:01.585
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm giving them a chance because they're repeating their cycle of the DS which worked for them.

34:01.645 --> 34:04.687
[SPEAKER_05]: They're slowly, they're unboxing it slowly.

34:05.708 --> 34:07.669
[SPEAKER_05]: Online will come into Nintendo in 08.

34:09.250 --> 34:11.712
[SPEAKER_05]: You already see it starting to happen with Mario Kart and stuff.

34:12.072 --> 34:15.695
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like it did on the DS, Mario Kart launched the whole online thing on the DS.

34:16.195 --> 34:19.438
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, do I think they're behind?

34:19.618 --> 34:19.898
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

34:19.978 --> 34:21.900
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I think their system is better than

34:24.108 --> 34:24.969
[SPEAKER_05]: at Microsoft.

34:25.089 --> 34:31.373
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly not, but it's better than nothing, which is pretty much what the GameCube had save one game.

34:31.833 --> 34:32.774
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's more to the email.

34:32.994 --> 34:33.234
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

34:34.435 --> 34:36.437
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, you guys are too self-depreciating.

34:36.777 --> 34:41.300
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is ten times better than any other podcast I've listened to because your personalities work so well together.

34:42.220 --> 34:48.905
[SPEAKER_02]: All the other podcasts just give me the straight news with limited opinions, which meticulously sidestep criticizing sponsors.

34:49.325 --> 34:53.108
[SPEAKER_02]: On OLR, I get my news mixed in with a little bit of Dirty Sanchez and Broadway show tunes.

34:53.922 --> 34:55.223
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are effing kick-ass.

34:55.323 --> 34:55.643
[SPEAKER_02]: Heon.

34:56.023 --> 34:59.945
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we didn't have any PlayStation 3 show tunes tonight amongst all those Sony news.

35:00.365 --> 35:00.946
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe next week.

35:00.966 --> 35:01.766
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

35:01.866 --> 35:06.289
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know, but the... Remember the week we had the Sony was marketing with show tunes?

35:06.569 --> 35:07.829
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this last week or two weeks ago?

35:07.950 --> 35:08.690
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

35:08.730 --> 35:09.110
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, forget it.

35:09.971 --> 35:10.351
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

35:10.371 --> 35:11.772
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and someone sent a spam, too.

35:12.672 --> 35:13.432
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't care, though.

35:13.893 --> 35:14.133
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.

35:14.153 --> 35:15.193
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like spam.

35:15.233 --> 35:15.273
Um...

35:17.944 --> 35:19.305
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, appreciate the email.

35:19.385 --> 35:25.590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that we've just been doing this so long, we've almost become jaded to an extent, but in a good way, you know?

35:25.931 --> 35:26.611
[SPEAKER_05]: We're honest.

35:27.112 --> 35:29.794
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing this underground for a long time.

35:29.914 --> 35:32.956
[SPEAKER_05]: Sponsors don't, we have to beg people to come on our show.

35:33.277 --> 35:39.342
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't come knocking on our door like they do for the big box sites that have magazines and all that things attached to them.

35:39.742 --> 35:45.767
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I think that's what our listeners enjoy, the fact that we're pretty much just like you, only we have microphones.

35:46.815 --> 35:48.036
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's pretty much it.

36:12.375 --> 36:12.675
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

36:12.735 --> 36:24.738
[SPEAKER_06]: But according to Electronic Entertainment Designer Research, they suggest that Xbox 360 Achievement Systems, called Accomplishments, I guess in the report, had an effect on the title's success.

36:25.818 --> 36:35.540
[SPEAKER_06]: According to the press release, there is a strong connection between a game's title's diversity of accomplishment types and what the game's profitability was.

36:36.620 --> 36:37.620
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't buy that one bit.

36:38.720 --> 36:41.621
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it doesn't mean anything.

36:42.349 --> 36:43.029
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, at least.

36:43.049 --> 36:47.571
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't think the achievement whores have enough of the market share?

36:48.652 --> 36:52.814
[SPEAKER_06]: I think achievement points get people to buy games that they would not necessarily buy.

36:52.894 --> 37:05.360
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know, for example, I bought Xbox Live Arcade games thinking, oh, hey, I can get some pretty easy achievements off there, and I would buy them and then find out, yeah, they suck, and those achievements are a lot harder to get.

37:05.760 --> 37:11.803
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that, if anything, I would think that the less achievements a game has, the better it'd sell.

37:12.519 --> 37:19.601
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for achievement whores at least, because if there's one achievement to give me 1,000 points or something, all I do is beat the game.

37:19.881 --> 37:26.303
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of the true achievement whores use Gamefly or one of those rental services anyway.

37:26.383 --> 37:27.603
[SPEAKER_05]: Rent the game, get the points, send it back.

37:27.623 --> 37:28.023
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

37:28.043 --> 37:29.584
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just a coincidence.

37:29.844 --> 37:34.445
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's just a trend that a lot of games are coming out and have more achievements.

37:34.545 --> 37:36.646
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

37:36.666 --> 37:41.047
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool that the achievements are in there, but I don't think it really has anything to do.

37:41.582 --> 37:43.323
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

38:11.600 --> 38:12.540
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

38:39.545 --> 38:42.646
[SPEAKER_02]: We were watching the Bollywood Awards last night.

38:42.706 --> 38:45.067
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we went to Indian Food today, actually, for lunch.

38:45.107 --> 38:50.988
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a little Jamie Robb brunch at the Indian Food place, and they were watching some award, and they were doing some of the musicals.

38:51.008 --> 38:51.809
[SPEAKER_05]: I got that guy's name.

38:51.829 --> 38:52.709
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of it's catchy.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.029
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that guy's name.

38:54.169 --> 38:54.529
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

38:54.669 --> 38:55.910
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that you got to see that performance.

38:56.130 --> 38:56.930
[SPEAKER_02]: Akshay Kumar.

38:57.590 --> 38:59.551
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, he is not in this game.

38:59.571 --> 39:02.352
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sad, because that was a freaking good performance.

39:02.692 --> 39:02.972
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

39:03.012 --> 39:04.292
[SPEAKER_02]: But that would be cool.

39:04.492 --> 39:06.993
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I would get that if we would get a release over here.

39:07.563 --> 39:08.584
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, who knows?

39:09.265 --> 39:11.146
[SPEAKER_05]: Write some emails, make some demands.

39:11.667 --> 39:12.668
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know what might happen.

39:13.488 --> 39:19.674
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the full song list is floating around out there, but I do notice certain artists are repeated several times in the game.

39:20.494 --> 39:21.095
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out.

39:21.175 --> 39:24.798
[SPEAKER_05]: I think those are the actual movies and not the artists.

39:25.539 --> 39:26.400
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that would make sense.

39:26.860 --> 39:27.240
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotcha.

39:27.941 --> 39:28.922
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so these are the productions.

39:29.022 --> 39:29.282
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

39:29.582 --> 39:32.525
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's quite a few there from Calho Naho, that movie.

39:33.421 --> 39:47.026
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya in chatroom says we need to import this game for Loki I don't know, Loki, feel like singing some Bollywood?

39:47.627 --> 39:58.651
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like singing anything I'm actually posting that website to the chatroom because my impromptu website of the week alright, it lives

40:00.313 --> 40:07.716
[SPEAKER_02]: So at any rate, in other news, there is still going to be a Golden Axe update.

40:09.376 --> 40:25.602
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be Golden Axe Beast Rider, which is exclusive for Xbox 360, and they are talking about them going to be a PS3 version, but it may not be the same one, but it's supposed to be a Golden Axe RPG.

40:27.267 --> 40:30.708
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard that both of those games are coming out in the spring of next year.

40:30.728 --> 40:32.448
[SPEAKER_06]: I think February or March.

40:32.468 --> 40:35.189
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that makes happy because I like Golden Axe.

40:36.349 --> 40:39.330
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't see the Beast Rider thing on there or anything like that.

40:39.990 --> 40:42.351
[SPEAKER_06]: But who knows?

40:42.571 --> 40:43.431
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool at least.

40:45.912 --> 40:47.812
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywho, so let's see here.

40:48.373 --> 40:59.419
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some other interesting stuff that was floating around the web this week, including a mod for the PC version of Half-Life 2, which includes the Portal gun from, of course, Portal.

40:59.899 --> 41:01.440
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks pretty awesome.

41:02.060 --> 41:08.083
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, all the fun things you would imagine you can do with a Portal gun, including throwing grenades through it and whatnot.

41:08.243 --> 41:10.344
[SPEAKER_06]: But who knows?

41:10.444 --> 41:14.626
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we'll see some multiplayer mods for Portal as well.

41:16.227 --> 41:17.348
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe an official release.

41:18.714 --> 41:20.415
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of love in our chat room, by the way.

41:20.435 --> 41:26.820
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed before the show started tonight, we had a lot of people in chat just spilling out their love for Portal, which is a game I have yet to play.

41:26.860 --> 41:33.906
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to bring it over, Loki, because I don't want to spend all that money for the Orange Box, because I've been buying too many games lately.

41:34.006 --> 41:40.031
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing against the folks at the Orange Box, but we need to share our resources here at Orange Lounge Radio.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.112
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do want to play Portal.

41:41.132 --> 41:42.133
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard a lot of good things about it.

41:42.719 --> 41:43.280
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cake is a Lie

41:56.817 --> 41:57.337
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

42:18.906 --> 42:22.450
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they've got Pokemon everything out there this day and age, right?

42:22.490 --> 42:26.734
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got, you know, the Pokemon, obviously, look at my collection of stuffed animals up here.

42:26.774 --> 42:30.257
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got the Pokemon, the Pikachus I have, little stuffed Jigglypuffs.

42:30.558 --> 42:35.242
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get them on mugs, shirts, hell, probably underoos with Pokemon on them too.

42:35.663 --> 42:39.406
[SPEAKER_05]: But now you can get Pokemon perfume.

42:40.667 --> 42:41.208
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

42:41.656 --> 42:44.918
[SPEAKER_05]: You can smell like Pikachu, I guess.

42:45.498 --> 42:46.199
[SPEAKER_05]: Peek-a-poo!

42:47.179 --> 42:51.241
[SPEAKER_05]: It's made by AirVal International is the name of the group that puts this out.

42:51.602 --> 42:53.923
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll cost you $15 US.

42:54.123 --> 42:58.145
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do not buy this for your children because there's enough stinky perfume in the world, thank you.

42:59.926 --> 43:03.308
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish sometimes the internet had a scratch and sniff thing on it because I'm kind of curious.

43:03.688 --> 43:05.529
[SPEAKER_05]: What does Pikachu perfume smell like?

43:06.150 --> 43:08.091
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably just some kind of generic scent.

43:08.531 --> 43:08.791
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

43:09.441 --> 43:12.622
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that almost all perfume smells nasty, though, but I'm allergic to it.

43:12.842 --> 43:16.964
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, FootyMonster would like to point out, when I was a kid, you could get Transformers perfume, Skye.

43:17.004 --> 43:19.905
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that rare to see perfumes of the popular franchises.

43:20.725 --> 43:21.625
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but still.

43:21.965 --> 43:22.426
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

43:23.666 --> 43:24.246
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

43:24.706 --> 43:25.967
[SPEAKER_05]: Pikachu perfume?

43:26.727 --> 43:27.107
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

43:28.628 --> 43:29.008
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

43:29.508 --> 43:31.489
[SPEAKER_05]: Son of Dad thinks they should make Pokemon Lube.

43:31.509 --> 43:31.549
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

43:31.849 --> 43:31.949
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

43:33.249 --> 43:33.549
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

43:33.790 --> 43:34.390
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not want.

43:34.630 --> 43:35.170
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not want.

43:35.959 --> 44:05.028
[SPEAKER_05]: Skype line is open for business 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio go ahead and give us a call and anything you want to talk about that we've talked about on this week's show or maybe there's a story that you want to talk about that we didn't get to tonight because actually in our choosing stories threads behind the scenes there's quite a lot of stories that didn't make the cut tonight I'm sure Loki will be getting to some of them though in last minute stories so Loki while we wait for some calls why don't we go over some last minute stories okay

44:06.129 --> 44:09.530
[SPEAKER_06]: There is one interesting thing, real briefly.

44:10.170 --> 44:14.031
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a Mass Effect Limited Edition coming out.

44:14.231 --> 44:18.953
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only going to be available online, only through EB and GameStop, which is kind of weird.

44:19.673 --> 44:21.434
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I don't know.

44:21.534 --> 44:23.454
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes out the same day, so November 20th.

44:25.515 --> 44:26.335
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

44:27.415 --> 44:31.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there was some other stuff, I guess, coming from Nintendo Power.

44:32.057 --> 44:33.617
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Chris Slate

44:34.164 --> 44:43.692
[SPEAKER_06]: He was saying that there's going to be a brand new online community coming soon from Nintendo Power because, remember, they closed the Insider Forums at one time.

44:45.113 --> 44:53.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, another interesting thing from the Simpsons game, which is, of course, being put out by EA, Grand Theft Scratch is no more.

44:53.159 --> 44:55.601
[SPEAKER_06]: They've made the change to name to Mob Rules now.

44:55.681 --> 44:57.563
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently those lawsuit things were working.

44:58.444 --> 44:58.764
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

44:59.224 --> 44:59.805
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

45:00.325 --> 45:01.226
[SPEAKER_05]: I just lost the call.

45:01.266 --> 45:03.107
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a call coming in on Skype and I missed it.

45:03.167 --> 45:03.448
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

45:03.628 --> 45:03.708
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

45:04.079 --> 45:04.559
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a story.

45:04.579 --> 45:05.640
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sure, Jamie, real quick.

45:07.201 --> 45:18.087
[SPEAKER_02]: Flint Dill, I guess that's how his last name is pronounced, was one of the writers for Riddick, and he's working on the Sin City game, and he and Frank Miller are working together on it.

45:18.187 --> 45:21.729
[SPEAKER_02]: And the quote says, Frank and I have been having a party coming up with nasty stuff for the game.

45:22.430 --> 45:29.454
[SPEAKER_02]: In true Sin City fashion, some old characters will return, new characters will appear, and without giving anything away, probably die horribly.

45:30.307 --> 45:33.249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know if the game is going to be anything like the movie.

45:33.289 --> 45:35.750
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I will feel it is all style and no substance.

45:35.790 --> 45:38.292
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a little bit of the movie, and I thought it was horrible.

45:38.852 --> 45:41.533
[SPEAKER_05]: Not my favorite movie in the world, but it's certainly pretty to look at.

45:41.593 --> 45:43.375
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we're finally getting some calls on the Skype line.

45:43.815 --> 45:44.855
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

45:44.875 --> 45:45.276
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

45:46.476 --> 45:46.816
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guys.

45:46.837 --> 45:47.237
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

45:47.457 --> 45:48.077
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Footy Monster.

45:48.257 --> 45:49.058
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Footy Monster.

45:49.078 --> 45:49.598
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

45:51.179 --> 45:51.539
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too bad.

45:51.559 --> 45:51.919
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too bad.

45:52.320 --> 45:53.220
[SPEAKER_08]: What about you guys?

45:53.380 --> 45:55.802
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed that last week you had quite a hectic show.

45:55.862 --> 45:57.302
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you sort it all out?

45:57.323 --> 45:58.083
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

45:58.910 --> 46:00.311
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week's show was very interesting.

46:00.371 --> 46:03.253
[SPEAKER_05]: We had surprise guests, surprise outages.

46:04.294 --> 46:07.396
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris was here, of course we love Chris, and Puppy was here, which was awesome.

46:08.276 --> 46:19.624
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had, you know, the show didn't get started for 40 minutes, or no, it was 20 minutes it took us to get the show started because two, I'm sorry, in our studio we used to have four mics.

46:20.546 --> 46:22.027
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46:48.005 --> 47:12.758
[SPEAKER_05]: and so oh my gosh it was just horrible but we fixed it we went and we got a new cable and a new microphone and everything's hunky-dory again and we're up to four microphones which is going to be great for our guests so very happy and then of course our internet went out during part b so uh we had no live element last week which kind of sucked but then we did the operator 11 stuff the bonus show we did which was really cool by the way yeah we actually had a lot of fun doing it and we're kind of doing it again tonight

47:13.548 --> 47:18.692
[SPEAKER_05]: Even for the podcast listeners, if you go to Operator11.com a little later, you're actually going to see our Guitar Hero 3 preview.

47:18.712 --> 47:26.397
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to unbox the demo kit and show you guys the guitar and the changeable faceplate, and to show you guys all the insies and outsies of Guitar Hero 3 a little later on this evening.

47:26.497 --> 47:29.719
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those of you listening on the podcast, check that out at Operator11.com.

47:31.120 --> 47:32.141
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll definitely be there checking it out.

47:32.321 --> 47:32.601
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

47:33.321 --> 47:34.222
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that all you wanted to ask?

47:34.282 --> 47:34.682
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

47:34.842 --> 47:42.387
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I actually had a little comment from the dark side, because God might grab a little pause on Music Jam, Hamilton and Music Jam.

47:42.708 --> 47:43.068
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what's up?

47:44.554 --> 47:46.717
[SPEAKER_08]: Good news for Loki, it is not that pink and fluffy.

47:46.977 --> 47:49.280
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, seriously?

48:04.725 --> 48:11.190
[SPEAKER_08]: The only time you see the face of the girl and all the pinkness is at the beginning, like you see the splash screen.

48:11.591 --> 48:15.794
[SPEAKER_08]: But other than that, the game is pretty normal, low-key with the girliness.

48:15.954 --> 48:17.255
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess that's a good thing.

48:17.935 --> 48:26.040
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's interesting is that the way it's set up, like, when you start the game, you don't have the freedom to choose, for instance, to play just the drums or to play just the bass guitar.

48:26.480 --> 48:27.861
[SPEAKER_08]: You're supposed to make the song.

48:28.121 --> 48:36.025
[SPEAKER_08]: So, because of that, you first have to play the lead guitar and, like, make the rhythm, which you can record, you have metronomes, so you can do everything.

48:36.465 --> 48:37.946
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really like jam sessions.

48:38.166 --> 48:46.171
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you press the D-pad and you select the chords, you have a whole selection of chords, but you can't customize the chords like you can in jam sessions, so that's a

48:46.861 --> 48:48.922
[SPEAKER_08]: for jam sessions, but not for Hannah Montana.

48:49.703 --> 49:13.475
[SPEAKER_08]: But then once you're done recording your lead guitar, which it's not just strumming, you can also pick individual strings, which is pretty good, then you can record a bass with individual strings for strumming, you can record a guitar for little solos and stuff, and you can even do the whammy bar and all that stuff, so it's really interesting, it's really feature complete.

49:13.935 --> 49:15.156
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Drunk Kid,

49:15.731 --> 49:20.635
[SPEAKER_08]: The drum kit you can play with two styluses if you want, so you have sort of like two little drumsticks.

49:21.015 --> 49:22.857
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you can use the whole DSL buttons.

49:22.897 --> 49:27.340
[SPEAKER_08]: Every button is signed for the drum stuff.

49:27.781 --> 49:32.685
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can press B, and it does the big drum thingy.

49:32.725 --> 49:35.847
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you press the D-pad, it does the hi-hat and stuff like that.

49:36.448 --> 49:44.454
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there like a plot or a stage set up, or is it just like jam sessions where you just kind of rock out?

49:45.666 --> 49:56.894
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but you know, it's funny that you can then take, like, your song, and there's an option to make it music video, which, it features Hannah Montana, you can change the camera around, make her play, make her dance around.

49:58.155 --> 50:05.160
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, seriously, I mean, it's like, it's a feature that's not there, which you might not like, but it's so much more feature-complete, I'm surprised.

50:05.721 --> 50:05.921
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

50:06.724 --> 50:18.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you've definitely become the unofficial spokesperson for the Hannah Montana franchise here on the show, so I'm curious to hear if some of our listeners actually go out and pick up this game and what they also think of it.

50:18.308 --> 50:20.449
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only $20, though.

50:20.729 --> 50:23.009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only $20, so not too bad a bargain.

50:23.369 --> 50:27.471
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hey, we've got to let you go to let some other folks on, but thank you so much for your call, and have fun with the Hannah Montana.

50:28.551 --> 50:28.871
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

50:29.311 --> 50:30.072
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

50:30.112 --> 50:30.372
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

50:32.608 --> 50:39.450
[SPEAKER_05]: If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

50:40.190 --> 50:42.951
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, any more last minute stories over yonder, over hither?

50:43.491 --> 50:45.691
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, some interesting things.

50:46.432 --> 50:52.433
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a new Logitech PC controller that apparently works perfectly on the PlayStation 3.

50:55.454 --> 50:56.814
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's kind of interesting.

50:56.854 --> 50:59.075
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess a dual action gamepad is what it is.

50:59.827 --> 51:04.951
[SPEAKER_06]: But it works on the PlayStation 3, which is kind of surprising that a PC controller would work on it.

51:05.972 --> 51:09.335
[SPEAKER_06]: And then another thing, which is kind of funny you just mentioned it.

51:09.796 --> 51:12.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Gran Turismo 5 is not really 1080p.

51:13.178 --> 51:14.079
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to another call.

51:14.139 --> 51:15.220
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

51:15.240 --> 51:15.581
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

51:16.521 --> 51:17.102
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up?

51:17.122 --> 51:17.963
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Ryoma.

51:18.523 --> 51:19.164
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Ryoma.

51:19.204 --> 51:20.064
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind, buddy?

51:21.626 --> 51:22.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing much.

51:22.647 --> 51:26.470
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually something that I was kind of interested in asking you guys.

51:27.102 --> 51:30.525
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been passive on a Super Metroid care recently.

51:30.725 --> 51:33.187
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably one of my favorite Super Nintendo games.

51:33.908 --> 51:38.091
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, obviously one of the fascinations with the games is the speedrun element.

51:38.211 --> 51:41.854
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to know, like, what do you guys think of speedrun?

51:42.495 --> 51:44.877
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've ever heard you mention anything about it.

51:45.117 --> 51:47.459
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, what are your opinions on speedrunning in games?

51:48.228 --> 51:49.548
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, run that by me one more time.

51:50.068 --> 51:52.329
[SPEAKER_05]: You said Super Metroid and what?

51:52.349 --> 51:53.909
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're a little bit fuzzy.

51:54.009 --> 51:55.570
[SPEAKER_05]: So say that again.

51:55.590 --> 51:58.690
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to know our opinion on... Speedrunning.

51:59.890 --> 52:01.151
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, speedrunning.

52:01.311 --> 52:02.591
[SPEAKER_05]: Speedrunning through the games.

52:02.971 --> 52:03.451
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

52:03.511 --> 52:04.331
[SPEAKER_05]: Speedruns are great.

52:04.731 --> 52:06.172
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fun to watch on YouTube.

52:06.292 --> 52:07.252
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not very good at it.

52:07.572 --> 52:08.552
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that's not true.

52:09.052 --> 52:12.373
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, just for shits and giggles, played through Mario Bros.

52:12.413 --> 52:14.793
[SPEAKER_05]: like as fast as I freaking... I mean, Super Mario Bros.

52:14.813 --> 52:17.414
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously is as fast as I can just to kind of like...

52:17.762 --> 52:18.863
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52:38.925 --> 52:40.646
[SPEAKER_02]: The 8-1 level of Super Mario Bros.

52:41.667 --> 52:43.589
[SPEAKER_02]: blindfolded, that was during a speedrun.

52:43.949 --> 52:45.550
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's awesome.

52:45.650 --> 52:57.539
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's because the whole level, if you don't, I mean, you can stop and try to get all the points, but if you're trying to have a full-time, well, it's close to a full-time by the time you get to the end of the thing, and not get hit by anything, it's a definite pattern to the whole level.

52:58.480 --> 53:01.162
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was, it was during a speedrun that I did it blindfolded.

53:01.482 --> 53:05.625
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably couldn't do it since, since I haven't touched the game in five years, but, you know.

53:06.314 --> 53:11.837
[SPEAKER_05]: and certainly a game like Super Metroid encourages you to do speedruns because you know you want the bra and panties shot at the end.

53:12.217 --> 53:15.559
[SPEAKER_05]: So in order to get that, you have to go through the game kind of as fast as you can.

53:16.639 --> 53:28.085
[SPEAKER_05]: And some folks in chatroom getting in on the conversation as well, TigerClaw says, the thing about Metroid speedruns is they do a lot of sequence breaking, basically collecting all the items and powerups out of order.

53:28.485 --> 53:34.928
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing about the original Metroid as well, I know you don't have to have this item to beat the game, but it helps, but the screw attack...

53:35.228 --> 53:35.588
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not really.

53:35.608 --> 53:38.310
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally think that speedrunning kind of takes the enjoyment out of the game.

54:03.402 --> 54:10.030
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I understand if, like, somebody loves a game to the point where they can just play through it really insanely quickly.

54:10.070 --> 54:16.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I can do that with Mega Man X. I can beat Mega Man X when I was really good at it in about half an hour.

54:16.417 --> 54:21.463
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to me it just kind of sucks the enjoyment out of the game.

54:21.503 --> 54:21.763
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

54:22.697 --> 54:23.737
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

54:47.639 --> 54:48.860
[SPEAKER_05]: because there's different ways to play the game.

54:48.880 --> 54:55.183
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also the complete anal retentive gameplay, which is me on any role-playing game.

54:55.323 --> 54:56.764
[SPEAKER_05]: I search everything.

54:56.904 --> 54:58.305
[SPEAKER_05]: I talk to everybody.

54:58.845 --> 55:10.951
[SPEAKER_05]: But I finish most of those games with some type of 100% completion or something like that because I'm so freaking anal retentive in my RPGs because I feel like I'm missing out on the story or I'm missing something important if I don't do it.

55:11.291 --> 55:13.412
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's like the complete opposite of a speedrun.

55:13.693 --> 55:16.254
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's one way you can certainly enjoy a game as well, right?

55:18.519 --> 55:20.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I understand that.

55:20.961 --> 55:22.602
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been one of those guys, personally.

55:22.963 --> 55:24.664
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're probably somewhere in the middle.

55:24.744 --> 55:25.305
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people are.

55:25.925 --> 55:26.226
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

55:27.287 --> 55:28.588
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, very cool.

55:28.848 --> 55:29.168
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

55:29.449 --> 55:32.291
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't talked about speedrunning a lot on the show, but there you go.

55:32.592 --> 55:33.773
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we invite the calls.

55:33.913 --> 55:36.215
[SPEAKER_05]: They get us to talk about things we may not normally talk about.

55:37.036 --> 55:38.957
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

55:39.538 --> 55:40.579
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one more thing.

55:40.659 --> 55:42.741
[SPEAKER_03]: For the love of God, don't buy boogies.

55:43.564 --> 55:44.645
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't buy Boogie.

55:44.705 --> 55:46.346
[SPEAKER_05]: Why should I stay the hell away from Boogie?

55:46.526 --> 55:48.248
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a terrible game.

55:48.868 --> 55:50.109
[SPEAKER_03]: What about it is so terrible?

55:51.050 --> 55:51.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, say that again?

55:52.091 --> 55:53.412
[SPEAKER_05]: What about it is so terrible?

55:54.673 --> 55:56.194
[SPEAKER_03]: The karaoke is terrible.

55:56.334 --> 55:58.816
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very simple game.

55:59.937 --> 56:01.639
[SPEAKER_03]: I found absolutely no enjoyment in it.

56:02.439 --> 56:08.844
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, maybe there's some rhythm game, like super hardcore rhythm aficionado out there that'll love Boogie.

56:09.045 --> 56:12.187
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't, so... Or maybe a 12-year-old girl somewhere.

56:13.068 --> 56:13.148
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

56:13.812 --> 56:16.855
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob in our chat room agrees with you.

56:16.875 --> 56:18.276
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, Boogie is a doorstop.

56:18.316 --> 56:19.377
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't adjust timing.

56:20.858 --> 56:21.678
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a doorstop.

56:22.459 --> 56:22.719
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

56:23.440 --> 56:23.780
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

56:23.820 --> 56:27.863
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Ryoma, thanks so much for the call, and stay the hell away from Boogie, everybody.

56:29.265 --> 56:29.565
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

56:29.705 --> 56:29.965
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

56:30.065 --> 56:30.646
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, buddy.

56:31.346 --> 56:31.686
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

56:32.687 --> 56:33.088
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

56:33.168 --> 56:35.790
[SPEAKER_05]: So a very cold review for Boogie.

56:36.130 --> 56:38.252
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, just be prepared.

56:38.612 --> 56:42.135
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to call in and tell us that a game sucks, we are going to ask you why.

56:42.614 --> 56:44.195
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68 When are you guys bringing back guys on the show?

57:12.276 --> 57:14.517
[SPEAKER_05]: Our spin-off show is on Orange Lounge Radio.

57:14.557 --> 57:15.657
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very good question.

57:15.717 --> 57:16.697
[SPEAKER_05]: When are we bringing back?

57:17.358 --> 57:20.058
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, our spin-off shows have been having a lot of trauma lately.

57:20.098 --> 57:24.180
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, Jamie's computer went poof, so that kind of screwed our Tuesday show.

57:24.640 --> 57:27.120
[SPEAKER_05]: Extifer moved, which kind of screwed our Wednesday show.

57:27.421 --> 57:29.881
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Thursday show is still going, STFU.

57:30.641 --> 57:31.322
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no.

57:32.262 --> 57:38.244
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, sometimes I drop by to listen to STFU, but, like, nothing happens.

57:38.264 --> 57:38.524
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-oh.

57:39.673 --> 57:45.518
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll have to get on our buddy up in Washington, Insanest, and see what's going on with that.

57:46.079 --> 57:50.683
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say probably our weeknight shows are going to be in a bit of limbo.

57:50.723 --> 57:53.125
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just kind of focusing everything on the Sunday shows right now.

57:53.566 --> 58:05.597
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm hoping around the time when we can kind of re-energize our website, because our website's falling apart too, kind of around the same time we're able to give that a kick in the ass, which I'm hoping will be by year's end.

58:06.038 --> 58:06.638
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

58:31.300 --> 58:31.981
[SPEAKER_02]: If I ever do.

58:32.321 --> 58:33.362
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you do.

58:33.542 --> 58:37.946
[SPEAKER_05]: And you also were tossing around, I don't know if I can even say, but there was another show idea.

58:38.146 --> 58:39.508
[SPEAKER_02]: Working on it.

58:39.928 --> 58:40.368
[SPEAKER_05]: Working on it.

58:40.749 --> 58:46.914
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping 2008, in the early stages of that, we can really refocus.

58:46.954 --> 58:51.799
[SPEAKER_05]: But for right now, we're making sure our Sunday show is staying consistent and doing this.

58:52.199 --> 58:53.500
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all we got.

58:54.902 --> 58:56.143
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides, I have a classroom...

58:58.105 --> 59:24.126
[SPEAKER_05]: 53645 and it takes me around 15 to 30 minutes to get back to my house from my campus so it's hard it'll be hard to catch guys on the show if I wanted to well I can tell you that the shows that don't use licensed music as a part of it may we may be looking into doing more podcasting you know STFU is being podcast for a little bit there we're thinking about it so it's very possible

59:24.878 --> 59:25.458
[SPEAKER_05]: You may see that.

59:25.698 --> 59:26.819
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can listen whenever you want.

59:27.579 --> 59:29.640
[SPEAKER_05]: Because hell, everybody podcasts these days.

59:31.080 --> 59:33.201
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't listen to podcasts anymore.

59:33.421 --> 59:34.841
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the live experience better.

59:35.141 --> 59:42.104
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree the live experience is ten times better, which is why we do this, and I think is part of what sets us apart from a lot of other folks that do this.

59:43.924 --> 59:50.827
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the live element is great, and I can't imagine doing a tape show, at least not right now.

59:51.447 --> 59:51.767
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

59:52.387 --> 59:52.667
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

59:52.767 --> 59:53.608
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a whole other challenge.

59:55.293 --> 01:00:02.679
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well GS68, thanks so much for the call and thanks for being such a fan of the station and calling us on our crap when we're missing out on the stuff we should be doing.

01:00:04.081 --> 01:00:04.541
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

01:00:04.621 --> 01:00:05.782
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, take care buddy.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:06.843
[SPEAKER_05]: See ya.

01:00:07.043 --> 01:00:07.364
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye bye.

01:00:10.026 --> 01:00:11.827
[SPEAKER_05]: Our website does need some help badly.

01:00:12.908 --> 01:00:17.833
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember like a long time ago we got some offer from a website design company in our mailbag.

01:00:17.873 --> 01:00:18.653
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have taken it.

01:00:18.753 --> 01:00:19.474
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why we didn't.

01:00:20.874 --> 01:00:22.335
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura and Loki for all their help.

01:00:22.355 --> 01:00:22.395
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

01:00:49.205 --> 01:00:53.686
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see the phone ringing anymore, but let's see if there's any more last-minute stories, and I'll see if we get any other calls.

01:00:54.527 --> 01:00:58.508
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, other fun stuff about that beautiful Katamari download content that we talked about earlier.

01:00:58.968 --> 01:01:00.108
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just keys.

01:01:00.188 --> 01:01:04.910
[SPEAKER_06]: All that info is already in the game, so you're just unlocking the ability to play it.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:06.790
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray!

01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:10.812
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta love it when game companies do that.

01:01:11.012 --> 01:01:11.792
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what else.

01:01:12.372 --> 01:01:12.552
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's...

01:01:17.082 --> 01:01:21.945
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be some type of ban on being able to call that downloadable content.

01:01:21.985 --> 01:01:25.247
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not downloadable content when it's already on the disc.

01:01:25.347 --> 01:01:27.328
[SPEAKER_05]: That is unlocked content.

01:01:27.828 --> 01:01:29.529
[SPEAKER_05]: That is pay to unlock content.

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:34.772
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should start a movement that we are not going to refer to that stuff as downloadable content anymore.

01:01:35.453 --> 01:01:36.353
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's call it what it is.

01:01:36.413 --> 01:01:38.134
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pay to unlock content.

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:41.717
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, just wanted to start a revolution.

01:01:41.937 --> 01:01:42.417
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind me.

01:01:43.817 --> 01:01:44.277
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocket Whores

01:02:12.918 --> 01:02:26.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Laser Lovers, Children, Campers, Hip Slinging Snipers, Achievement Whores, Deserters, Heavy Brothers, and I guess that's it.

01:02:28.405 --> 01:02:28.745
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:32.026
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess that's... Oh, Heavy Breathers, my mistake.

01:02:32.647 --> 01:02:33.347
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes more sense.

01:02:34.088 --> 01:02:41.890
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's going to go ahead and do it for us tonight, wrap up, because we do want to get out of here at somewhat a reasonable hour because we're going to be doing the Guitar Hero 3 thing in a little bit.

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:44.190
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to wrap it up and say goodnight.

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:47.671
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:02:48.591 --> 01:02:49.571
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start with Loki tonight.

01:02:49.611 --> 01:02:50.391
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought.

01:02:51.992 --> 01:02:55.953
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is there's a lot of games coming out soon.

01:02:56.833 --> 01:02:57.453
[SPEAKER_06]: I need more money.

01:02:58.693 --> 01:03:02.954
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is root beer is delicious, but root beer floats are even better.

01:03:03.484 --> 01:03:05.625
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, but Dole Whip floats are the best.

01:03:06.846 --> 01:03:07.987
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

01:03:09.948 --> 01:03:10.488
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have one.

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:13.770
[SPEAKER_05]: Abstaining tonight from the final thought process.

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.650
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.891
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:15.571
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a free country.

01:03:15.591 --> 01:03:16.211
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't have one.

01:03:16.952 --> 01:03:17.232
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:03:17.912 --> 01:03:18.272
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

01:03:20.254 --> 01:03:25.897
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you guys very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio by...

01:03:27.062 --> 01:03:27.642
[SPEAKER_05]: Checking us out.

01:03:27.683 --> 01:03:28.383
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

01:03:28.503 --> 01:03:31.465
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is the independent folks that keep us alive.

01:03:31.546 --> 01:03:36.149
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you enjoy the show, tell two people that you enjoy the program.

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:39.992
[SPEAKER_05]: And we spread the word little by little and end up taking over the world.

01:03:40.613 --> 01:03:41.233
