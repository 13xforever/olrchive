00:11.500 --> 00:15.000

00:15.000 --> 00:19.500
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.500 --> 00:25.500
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, October the 21st, 2007.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.500
And of course, Orange Lounge Radio does tape live on Sunday nights

00:28.500 --> 00:32.000
and releases the live show in two parts, part A and B.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
And you're listening to part B right now, which means we've already taken care of the formalities.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
So let's get back to the gaming news.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
So anyways, something we've been talking about for the last few weeks here is the Xbox 360 arcade SKU.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
It doesn't exist, but it actually does.

00:47.000 --> 00:55.000
Apparently, there has been some interesting proof for this, including someone actually buying one.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
So, I mean, duh.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
But, yeah, it is basically, you know, a core system now with a wireless controller.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
It does have HDMI on it.

01:05.000 --> 01:15.000
It will feature a 256 megabyte memory unit and a disk including five Xbox Live Arcade trial games, apparently.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.500
Boom Boom Rocket, Feeding Frenzy, Luxor 2, and Pac-Man Championship and Uno.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.000
That's fucking lame.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
They're only trial games?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
That does seem a little weird.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Has that been confirmed that they're actually just the trial games?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
That kind of sucks a lot.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
It says, let's see here, plus five trial games.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Box lists five games and it says plus five trial games.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
So, oh, you get the console, the peripherals, plus these five trial games,

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
or you get the five full Xbox Liveware games plus five totally separate games.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
I don't know, they didn't really say what it's on there, but...

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Well, maybe if Microsoft will actually acknowledge the existence of this, then...

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Can't we tell you this much, okay?

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
Not supposed to say anything, but it's going to be fucking announced on the 23rd, officially,

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
because that's the day it comes out.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Well, that's fine. This podcast won't hit till the 23rd for most people, so...

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Yeah, it's coming out. It will be officially announced on the 23rd.

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
I don't know why, even after all this stuff, that they're still insisting on keeping it a fucking secret.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
I mean, when people are leaking it out there, it's been purchased, it's been out there,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
why they're still denying it's coming out, but they have a whole marketing plan behind it,

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
how they're going to promote it and stuff.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
So, it will be officially announced on the 23rd.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
What's so special about the 23rd?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
It's whenever they're fucking... It's when this is coming out. I don't know why.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Okay.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
What's so special about it?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Does it line up with an expo or something?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
No, it's just whenever they feel like it.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Interesting.

02:36.000 --> 02:44.000
And, I guess, I think also at the same time, that's when the elite bundle that they're doing for the holidays is coming out as well.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
So, that's pretty much it.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah. So, not a huge surprise.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
It was totally not coming out or anything.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Well, back to the rumor camp.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
And, you know, most Microsoft rumors do end up being true.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
So, this could be something that does come to light.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Although, I don't know. This is a little bit far-fetched for me.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I forgot to mention, sorry, real quick.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Yes. No, that's all right.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
It was confirmed by Microsoft.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
They did confirm that it is coming.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
They just never said anything else beyond that.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
But, they're like, you just need to wait for details.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
They're like, arcade for us is the ability to bring in a new set of audiences.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
They're probably a little bit more casually focused.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
And, they're looking for a new family experience and more price focused.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
Robbie Bach told Financial Times, marking Microsoft's first public comments about the new SKU.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
Of course, they didn't really say what was included with it or any of the details and stuff.

03:43.000 --> 03:52.000
But, like I said, 23rd, all this will be finally officially announced and our Microsoft rep can finally calm down a little bit.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Well, this will be something that could bring people in.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
And, that is combining the HD DVD player and the Xbox 360.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
A lot of us have kind of wondered, why hasn't this been done already?

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
Well, there are rumors going around that Toshiba is actually teaming up with Microsoft to be making an actual HD DVD slash Xbox 360.

04:11.000 --> 04:19.000
And, when I hear this, my mind kind of goes to, you remember the Panasonic Q, I think it was called, that was the GameCube slash DVD player that you could only get in Japan?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yeah.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Right, is that what it was called, Jamie?

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Didn't we see one of those once when we went to one of those import gaming stores, the Panasonic device that played the GameCube games?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I believe so.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Hmm, so.

04:29.000 --> 04:36.000
Anyhow, Toshiba seems to be making something like that, I'm assuming, that combines HD DVD and Xbox 360.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
The device supposedly will include an HD DVD player.

04:39.000 --> 04:54.000
It is 1080p with HDMI, wireless networking, dual HD tuners with a program guide, an MP3 player dock, and possibly also a 40-inch TV to come with it or sold separately that will dock the actual 360.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Here's a funny thought.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Interesting.

04:56.000 --> 05:05.000
Because I remember way back when they were talking about TVs that would have the original Xbox integrated into them as something like this.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
How much do you want to bet this isn't actually a 360, it's a Toshiba HD DVD player that will also play Xbox 360 games?

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
That's kind of what the Panasonic Q was, right?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
It was just a DVD player that would also play GameCube games.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
It was kind of cool.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Sort of, yeah.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
So anyway, here's why folks are getting all speculative about this.

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
Apparently an unnamed or unknown Toshiba rep actually said, an Xbox with a built-in DVD drive is critical.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
They and we are working on it.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
It also has to be more than a gaming machine.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Microsoft recognizes this.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
A version of the device may also be sold under the Toshiba brand name.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Hmm.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Hmm.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
That would make sense.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I mean, didn't we have a bajillion different versions of the CDI?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I suppose.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
The 3DO, I'm sorry.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
It is kind of interesting because I don't think we've seen anything really like this since the Panasonic Q.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
And even then the Panasonic Q wasn't even sold here.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
And here's the thing, too, about that.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.000
That way if it is branded under the Toshiba name, when you have the Sony guy saying, hey, look at this.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
See, this 360 is like $800 or something and it comes with all this stuff.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Well, you can get the PlayStation 3 and it does just as well.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Well, they can say, well, it's actually not an Xbox 360.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
It just happens to play Xbox 360 games.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
You know, kind of spin it that way, I guess.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
But that's neat, I guess.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Hmm.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
Let's hope the HD DVD ends up winning out because otherwise that's going to be a big pile of useless crap.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
Well, at least there's quite a few movies already available, including Heroes Season 1, which I still need to buy on HD DVD.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
I don't really care about HD DVD at all, though.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
I have a Blu-ray player.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
All right, lady.

06:50.000 --> 07:01.000
So in other HD DVD news, you are also going to be given five free movies if you buy the Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on.

07:01.000 --> 07:17.000
You can choose from Serenity, which is like the best movie ever, The Chronicles of Riddick, Hulk, Children of Men, The Fast and the Furious, Tokyo Drift, Troy, Full Metal Jacket, yeah, Corpse Bride, The Prestige, Swordfish, Black Rain, Dream Girls, and World Trade Center.

07:17.000 --> 07:27.000
The way you claim this is you fill out a form, send in a copy of your barcode, and Microsoft will send you your stuff within 28 days.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
Hey, wait, what if I bought mine like six months ago? Can I still cut out the barcode?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
No.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Damn it.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
You have to have a receipt.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Jerks.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Approve purchase.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
Just for our friends in the UK, the add-on is 115 pounds.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
And this is just starting in the UK right now.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
They've been having something similar in the US since August.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Oh.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Still doesn't do me any good.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
It's old, though. It will run until the end of January.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
I was an early adopter.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Hey, Serenity.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
I can understand how the iPhone folks feel.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
That's true. Serenity is actually a movie I still need to get on HD DVD. I somehow don't have it yet.

07:59.000 --> 08:20.000
It's kind of funny that you mentioned Heroes earlier because I believe that Best Buy is doing a thing right now where you can get a HD DVD add-on for the 360 and get a free copy of the Heroes HD DVD set, including also those five extra DVDs that you can mail away for.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Well, I just missed out on everything, didn't I?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Yeah.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
Boy, early adopters really get screwed over sometimes.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Yeah, definitely.

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
Anyways, so other fun stuff to talk about here, including some download content that's going to be coming available.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Well, it is available right now in Japan for Beautiful Katamari.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
And it's four different little pieces of download content, each 200 Microsoft points.

08:44.000 --> 08:54.000
And they're four different levels, including the Milky Way Consolations, the Weaver Girl, Shopping Spree, and High-Calorie Katamari.

08:54.000 --> 09:04.000
And basically what these are, the Milky Way Consolation has you roll up 88 constellations to create a new Milky Way.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
The Weaver Girl, you roll up a huge ball of yarn and string to create Vega, the Weaver Girl.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
And Shopping Spree, make a space station but be thrifty about it.

09:15.000 --> 09:23.000
And I guess it sounds like an offshoot of a Katamari mission from one of the previous games where the value of items are collected and taken into account.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
And High-Calorie Katamari, feed Cetus the Whale, roll up lots of food.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
And that reminds me a little bit of the one from We Love Katamari where he rolled a sumo wrestler around East.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Oh yeah, that was cool.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
So those are available right now in Asia and Japan, no word on the U.S. yet.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
But I'm sure that they'll be coming soon.

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
Now I didn't mention this during my gaming week earlier in the show, but I did finally when I went out and bought the new microphone for the studio today.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
I went out and bought a beautiful Katamari and played it for about five minutes.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
So I'm not ready to give the game a full review yet.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
Although I have heard a lot of folks have been saying it's awfully short, but we'll see.

10:01.000 --> 10:09.000
But I just wanted to go and say, you know, despite all the controversy between us and that game, let it be known that OLR knows how to forgive.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
I went out and bought the game anyway.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
So when you look up forgiveness in the dictionary and see our picture next to it, you'll understand why.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Oh don't worry, I know how to forgive.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
I went out and got the game as well.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
All right, I'm sure you did.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
All right.

10:23.000 --> 10:34.000
I don't know if we'll be able to forgive the makers of this game though if it stinks and really devalues the value of the incredible series and miniseries behind it.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Of course I'm talking about Battlestar Galactica.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
The game is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
Well you already knew that, that the game was coming and that you can play as Cylons, you can play as humans.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
What you may not know is that the game is coming out this week, that's right, probably by the time most of you are hearing this podcast.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
This game will be up on Xbox Live ready to download.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
They're calling it a 3D space shooter played on a 2D plane.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
Yeah, it sounds a lot like Wing Commander Arena.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
And if I remember correctly, I think it's made by the same people too.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Great track record with that game.

11:10.000 --> 11:20.000
We'll see. Just in time for the premiere of RZR, Battlestar Galactica RZR, of course the little miniseries about the Pegasus will be debuting November 24th.

11:20.000 --> 11:28.000
Oh, by the way, for those folks that are asking how much the game will cost, such as JAP28 is asking in our chat room,

11:28.000 --> 11:37.000
$20 on Xbox, I'm sorry, no, scratch that, $20 on the PC, 800 Microsoft Points or $10 on Xbox Live Arcade.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
You can get it a day earlier on PCs, October 23rd, $20, not too shabby.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
Joy. This is a little bit of joy, even though I'm probably not going to bother buying the game.

11:47.000 --> 11:55.000
Sega Superstar Tennis is going to have, of course, a bunch of different Sega characters in it.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
You have Sonic, you have Amigo from Samba de Amigo, which I think is pretty cool.

12:00.000 --> 12:09.000
Ooh La La. It's being worked on by Sumo Digital. I'm not seeing anything else about who else is going to be in it,

12:09.000 --> 12:15.000
or a date for that matter, but we do have it on PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Nintendo DS.

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
Please tell me that every time Ooh La La hits the ball, she'll go choo, choo, choo.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
That would be good.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
For those of you who play Space Channel 5, that's funny.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
I do like what they mentioned on Kotaku, that they want to see characters from House of the Dead and Altered Beast. That'd be cool.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
That would be kind of rad.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
I want to play as a zombie. That'd just be awesome.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
And then, like, when you win, you eat the other person?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Amazing Zombie Tennis, the game. That would be kind of fun.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
We'll see. Are you listening, Sega? Make it happen.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I don't think that's going to happen.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I don't think so either, but it's going to be a dream.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
Anyways, one thing that is happening, though, and also on the 23rd, will be Guitar Hero music,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
available for download, at least a digital download,

12:56.000 --> 13:03.000
including music from Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 2, and Guitar Hero Encore, Rock the 80s.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
It will be available from Wave Group, and I guess affiliated with, you know, other stuff.

13:09.000 --> 13:17.000
And it will be available, I guess, across such download sites as AOL, iTunes, Napster, Rhapsody, and Yahoo.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
Somebody told me there's actually a DDR soundtrack on iTunes now for Supernova 2. I didn't even know that.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
That's kind of neat.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I didn't know either, so.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
We used to have our own little playlist uploaded on iTunes that had all the DDR music from the games

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
and where they could be found on iTunes, but I didn't bother to maintain it.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
I think I updated it after last year's wave of games, and now there's just too many songs to keep track of.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
iTunes has a lot now.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
Anyhow, so I guess you can download that if you want to hear the Guitar Hero versions of songs,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
which, you know, some of them are pretty good, not too shabby.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
Maybe we'll put some of them on Rotation in our regular 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week program

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
on orange.traded.com with the gaming music.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
And hopefully the music won't stop like E for All did when the power...

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Somebody forgot to pay the bill at E for All and the power got shut off.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
No, just kidding. That's not the reason why.

14:06.000 --> 14:14.000
But on Friday night at about 7 o'clock, E for All came to a very abrupt end because the lights went out.

14:14.000 --> 14:21.000
A lot of folks were watching a match between Fatality, he was playing Quake 4,

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
and some other folks were playing Super Mario Galaxy and some of the other games that were available there,

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
and then the power shut off on the whole right half of South Hall,

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
and that would have been where the Nintendo and the EA booths were,

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
which were pretty much the main reasons why people were going to the show right there between those two,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
and so they decided to end the show at that point.

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
The staff quickly escorted everybody out of the convention hall

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
because when the power goes out, that's actually not safe.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
So, safety hazard.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Money back!

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Refund.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
I know, but wasn't the show going to close at like 8 anyway?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
I don't know. I don't remember the hours for the show,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
but I seem to recall it was going to close kind of early anyway.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
And by the way, this isn't the first time something like this has happened at the convention center.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
There have been some previous E3s where similar things have happened,

15:07.000 --> 15:13.000
but it just kind of sucks that it's happening to E4ALL when they're kind of...

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
They've been taking a lot of crap from various game blogs and stuff

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
for not being up to the same level that many of us remember with the big E3 expos,

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
so this doesn't help them try to get past that.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
You know what I mean?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Sorry, E4ALL.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
No, you're not.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
You're just saying that.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Alright, I am.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Okay.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
The PS3 is actually seeing an increase in sales in Europe now.

15:42.000 --> 15:49.000
They have gone up by 178%.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
Wow.

15:52.000 --> 15:59.000
But that's with the introduction of the 60GB bundle and the new 40GB unit that came out.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Was there a price drop that just went in there?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Oh, yes, there was a price drop that happened too recently.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Yep, there was.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
And I'm sure there may be...

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
They also were saying that the software sales increased with a Resistance Fall of Man

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
actually taking a rise in its chart status

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
and Heavenly Sword and Motorstorm.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Those are kind of the must-have PS3 games at this point,

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
so not too surprising that folks getting their new PS3s are picking up those games.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
That makes sense to me.

16:31.000 --> 16:38.000
Anyways, oh my God, they totally announced the 40GB system for the US.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
I'm so shocked.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
I did not realize that that was coming.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Holy crap.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
You're the worst liar ever.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Holy crap.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
I know.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
So much enthusiasm.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah, so Sony finally announced this system.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
They have really done a great job of keeping it under wraps.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
No one knew anything about it.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Apparently, yeah, it's coming out now November 2nd.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
It'll officially be $400 US for $399.99, however you want to look at it.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
And, of course, there is no backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 games.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
And at the same time, they've also dropped down the 80GB system to $499.99,

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
so $100 cheaper.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Awesome.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
Well, one thing that's kind of been pissing people off about these new systems,

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
the 40GB system, of course, removes completely the backwards compatibility of the PlayStation 2 games.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
You cannot play them.

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
And the Wall Street Journal actually interviewed Sony Computer Entertainment boss Jack Trenton

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
on the whole issue about the backwards compatibility.

17:41.000 --> 17:47.000
And what he said is that this has nothing to do with reducing Sony's cost of manufacturing.

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
People would go and speculate that, oh, they had to fit a whole PlayStation 2 in the PlayStation 3,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
so taking that out saves them money.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Nope.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
The reason why they did this was, quote,

17:57.000 --> 18:05.000
encouraging buyers of the entry-level PlayStation 3 to purchase more games designed specifically for the new system.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
You are an idiot.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
I'm sorry.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
That was horrible.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Lie. Lie to them, people.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
Seriously, don't go, oh, I'm sorry, we took it out just to fuck you over.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
So, I mean, you've lied to them.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
You say, yes, we did the same cost, and people, oh, okay.

18:22.000 --> 18:29.000
And if they don't want to spend the money, they can go buy the 80-gig system for some more money.

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
But seriously, you don't go, no, I'm sorry, we really didn't take it out just to save money.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
Sure, we saved a little bit of money, but really it was just to fuck you guys over.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I mean, come on.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Who let him talk?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Seriously, who let him talk?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I think Pekor Uno in our chat room would agree with you.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
chat.orangelandstrator.com.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
Pekor Uno says, Sony PR, please shut the fuck up.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Please, please, please.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Come on.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Who let him talk?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
That's all I want to know.

18:57.000 --> 19:05.000
I mean, you don't, I'm sorry, I try to be as positive as I can with these guys, but they're really making it tough on me.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
I mean, seriously.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
I thought they just came out the week before and said, okay, well, the reason why is because we removed these chips,

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
and we removed these chips so that we can cut the price a little bit so that we could drop the price of the system.

19:18.000 --> 19:26.000
Okay, that makes sense in logic there, but if you're just fucking with us and just removing it because you want to sell some more PlayStation 3 games,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
well, then fuck you.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
I mean, seriously.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Interesting thought in our chat room.

19:32.000 --> 19:41.000
Rob Babak says in our chat room, or it could be that Sony wants you to buy backwards compatibility from the PlayStation Network.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Oh, wouldn't that be mean?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
That's really mean if that's true.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
But they have said it's software-based. That is definitely plausible.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
No, because it's software-based for the PlayStation 1.

19:53.000 --> 20:01.000
What it was is they had a chip that was running the graphics stuff for the PlayStation 2, but the emotion engine was software-based.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
So unless they completely rewrote it to...

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
But then they get rid of, like in the European ones, didn't they get rid of that and replace it with software?

20:09.000 --> 20:14.000
Yeah, they got rid of one of the two chips, but this 40 gig system has zero of the two chips.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
So that's why I can't run anything.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
It's all fucked up, however you look at it.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
I mean, if they're going to make you buy backwards compatibility later on, that's also fucked up.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
That's just asking for Microsoft to just come back at you with some PR spin on it.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
I mean, seriously.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I'm glad I bought mine when I did.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
Some days I want to go just cut your losses and let's hear about PlayStation 4.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
It really, I mean...

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
It's getting harder.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
I'm sorry, Sony fanboys, but at the same time, I'm not.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
It's like, you know, they just don't make...

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
They don't make a good case right about now, you know what I mean?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
They just keep shooting themselves in the foot over and over and over.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
There's nothing, I mean, honestly, I'm...

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
For the last few weeks, I've been really questioning whether I want to get Ratchet & Clank Future because I haven't paid for it.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
I'm just like, eh, maybe I want something else instead.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
I can buy a 360 game with that or something.

21:08.000 --> 21:16.000
It's just, I don't know, I've been downloading stuff off the Japanese PlayStation Network.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
They actually have some stuff to download on there.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.000
On the bright side, maybe the price will drop again before Final Fantasy 13 comes out.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
I can dream.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
You know what?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Yeah, seriously.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
When?

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Well, what?

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
Final Fantasy 13 will probably come out in Japan late next year.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
It'll be 2009 at the earliest.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
You'll be lucky if it comes out next year.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Yeah, I know.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
You'll be lucky.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
I know.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Well, that's...

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Maybe there will be another price drop before that.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I'm not holding my breath.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Who knows?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
I don't know.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Me neither.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
I got stuff to play on other systems, meanwhile.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
It's fine.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
Well, at least the few things are going to be on PlayStation Network.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
There's Flow and Warhawk.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Flow is spelled with a zero.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
It's Leet.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Well, it's the way the game is.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
Yeah.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
It looks very...

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
It looks kind of electroplanktony.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Are you saying the game is a zero?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
No, I like the game.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
I like the game.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
It's the only game I've bought from PlayStation Network.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
Well, these are expansions that are going to be out for there.

22:11.000 --> 22:19.000
The Flow expansion is going to have a multiplayer mode and a new playable creature, and then

22:19.000 --> 22:26.080
Warhawk is going to be another dropship, and you can pick up and relocate ground vehicles.

22:26.080 --> 22:31.000
Multiplayer on Flow could be interesting, even though wasn't Flow more of like an experience

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
than a game, so to say?

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
It puts you to sleep.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
It does.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
It's soothing.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
It's very soothing.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
It looks pretty.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
You tilt the controller around and eat shit, and it is a pretty-looking game, but it's

22:44.000 --> 22:48.880
like something that you would see at a rave or something where they're playing chill-out

22:48.880 --> 22:55.080
music and just watching some of the pretty colors and the soothing music.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.080
It's ambient.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.200
I don't know.

22:57.200 --> 23:00.280
These minimalist games, though, sometimes are extremely popular.

23:00.280 --> 23:04.960
If you think about it, every Xtreme, which I was talking about earlier, there's one button

23:04.960 --> 23:06.960
in the game to blow up your ship.

23:06.960 --> 23:07.960
Exactly.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.600
I don't have a problem with that game.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.880
That's why I bought Flow.

23:12.880 --> 23:13.880
That says a lot.

23:13.880 --> 23:18.960
Because buying stuff off of the PlayStation Network is a bitch, and I don't like doing

23:18.960 --> 23:21.640
it, so Flow is good.

23:21.640 --> 23:26.360
Kiki in our chat room says, screw Flow, get Everyday Shooter, which is a game I've heard

23:26.360 --> 23:27.360
good things about.

23:27.360 --> 23:31.560
But Everyday Shooter wasn't available when Flow first became available, so, you know.

23:31.560 --> 23:35.600
But yeah, I've thought about buying that game too, because that looks good.

23:35.600 --> 23:40.120
Anyways, another game, as I mentioned earlier, that I tried out, and it is available on the

23:40.120 --> 23:46.120
Japanese PlayStation Network, so if you don't have a Japanese account, create one, download

23:46.120 --> 23:50.700
it, and then you can play it on any of your accounts, but it's Gran Turismo 5 Prologue,

23:50.700 --> 23:52.020
the demo.

23:52.020 --> 23:56.080
So it's a demo for a demo, I guess, or a demo for a demo game that you're going to have

23:56.080 --> 23:57.800
to buy or something like that.

23:57.800 --> 24:06.140
Anyways, it features a few cars, I believe there's like, I want to say, like six cars

24:06.140 --> 24:09.820
to choose from or something in the very beginning.

24:09.820 --> 24:16.300
And there's going to be single player stuff, no online.

24:16.300 --> 24:19.900
It's a cool looking game, I think there's like one track.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.320
Definitely worth checking out.

24:21.320 --> 24:24.920
Personally, though, when this comes out, I wouldn't buy it.

24:24.920 --> 24:28.060
But hey, if you love Gran Turismo, get your hands on it.

24:28.060 --> 24:30.400
What about the full game when it's released?

24:30.400 --> 24:32.140
I wouldn't buy it.

24:32.140 --> 24:35.440
It's going to be, they're talking $40 for the full game.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.480
Fuck that, I'll wait for the real game to come out and pay like $20 more.

24:38.480 --> 24:41.020
I mean, what's the point?

24:41.020 --> 24:47.160
And also, the other thing too is, make sure you download Gran Turismo HD if it's still

24:47.160 --> 24:51.560
available on the PlayStation Network, because I know that they're taking that down soon

24:51.560 --> 24:54.760
when 5 comes out.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.760
But definitely worth checking it out.

24:55.760 --> 24:59.000
It's a cool looking game, just wouldn't buy it.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
All right.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.400
Well, a very interesting comment coming out of the San Jose Mercury News, Dean Takahashi

25:06.400 --> 25:10.440
is a reporter for the Mercury News and talks often about video games.

25:10.440 --> 25:16.080
And he was writing earlier this week about the latest sales number, and also said this

25:16.080 --> 25:20.740
quote, quote, one piece of news that came out this week was that Sony pleaded with third

25:20.740 --> 25:25.120
party developers not to abandon its struggling platform.

25:25.120 --> 25:30.680
That change in attitude is a marked difference compared to the arrogance of past years.

25:30.680 --> 25:35.360
Very interesting to think that Sony could be on its knees begging people not to leave

25:35.360 --> 25:36.360
right now.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.680
It kind of makes me go, I wonder who's thinking of jumping ship right now.

25:38.680 --> 25:39.680
Well, it makes sense.

25:39.680 --> 25:41.440
I mean, if you think about it, I mean, look at it.

25:41.440 --> 25:46.480
The system has the least amount of, as far as, I hate calling it next gen, but as far

25:46.480 --> 25:53.320
as the next gen platforms, it has the least market share, at least in the US, and it's

25:53.320 --> 25:56.540
more expensive to develop for and it takes a lot longer to develop for.

25:56.540 --> 26:00.280
Why would you spend the extra money and time to develop a game for the PlayStation 3 when

26:00.280 --> 26:04.480
you can equally do it for the Xbox 360 and be able to sell more units?

26:04.480 --> 26:07.780
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

26:07.780 --> 26:10.400
So I don't know, I'm not surprised.

26:10.400 --> 26:14.280
And I wish they had done it sooner because now they're just pissing people off.

26:14.280 --> 26:17.360
Keep in mind there's some developers out there that have really strongly voiced an opinion

26:17.360 --> 26:18.760
about the PlayStation 3.

26:18.760 --> 26:24.640
One of the folks at Valve said the PlayStation 3 was a waste of everyone's time and could

26:24.640 --> 26:30.840
be indicating why folks are starting to jump ship and Sony's begging people to stay around.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.720
Speaking of which, Half-Life 2, the orange box on PlayStation 3 not coming out until

26:34.720 --> 26:37.440
December now.

26:37.440 --> 26:43.880
And as some folks are speculating, if at all, if you keep getting delay, delay, delay, eventually

26:43.880 --> 26:49.400
you might start seeing cancelled, cancelled, cancelled, I think this holiday season could

26:49.400 --> 26:50.400
make or break Sony.

26:50.400 --> 26:54.800
I don't want to sound all like finalists here, but if Sony doesn't manage to sell through

26:54.800 --> 26:58.600
a lot of consoles, it's interesting because Extrofer and I, for those who didn't hear

26:58.600 --> 27:02.600
the bonus segment tonight, Extrofer and I drove to Disneyland together and we were talking

27:02.600 --> 27:03.600
about game stuff.

27:03.600 --> 27:09.440
He works at a large retail chain right now that sells electronics as a part of it and

27:09.440 --> 27:15.960
he says, he's like, I'm not biased, but I'm sitting there and I'm watching, we are selling

27:15.960 --> 27:22.800
quite a few Xbox 360, tons of Wii's, I have never, now keep in mind he works overnights,

27:22.800 --> 27:27.360
but he sees these systems go even in the overnight shifts and he says, I have never seen us sell

27:27.360 --> 27:29.000
a PlayStation 3.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.760
Well Walmart's kind of a weird demographic, I mean I don't think people go buy PlayStation

27:34.760 --> 27:36.760
3's there.

27:36.760 --> 27:43.240
The thing, I mean seriously though, I'm just taking it right now as to date, and I was

27:43.240 --> 27:46.600
talking to you about this before the show started because kind of going back to the

27:46.600 --> 27:50.800
whole Eye of Judgment bet that we have right now so far and I was looking at the numbers

27:50.800 --> 27:57.200
after the MPD group reported on for September, year to date the PlayStation 3, there's not

27:57.200 --> 28:02.800
been a game that's sold over 400,000 units in the United States, which isn't that great.

28:02.800 --> 28:07.000
I mean when you consider like Halo sold 2 million units and there's a bunch of other

28:07.000 --> 28:13.640
games that have sold millions of units and stuff like that, 300,000 or 335,000 if I remember

28:13.640 --> 28:20.120
correctly was for Resistance Fall Man, it's not that good.

28:20.120 --> 28:24.320
And I know people are waiting for Metal Gear Solid 4, which is going to be an awesome game,

28:24.320 --> 28:28.240
you know, and that will be probably a must have game for the PlayStation 3, may help

28:28.240 --> 28:33.840
them sell some units, but I think a lot of people in hope to God that they don't announce

28:33.840 --> 28:39.320
that there's going to be an Xbox 360 version for that around the same time, you know, I

28:39.320 --> 28:43.680
think that may sell some units for them, but at the same time there's not, they're going

28:43.680 --> 28:50.260
to lose out this holiday for sure, that's a fact, and by the time that all these good

28:50.260 --> 28:56.000
games come around it's going to be too late, that's really what it's going to be, so.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.920
Hope they make it, I mean, because I'd like to see all three consoles doing good, but.

29:00.920 --> 29:09.400
I don't know, I don't know, alright, yet again, another Sony debate here on the program, hey

29:09.400 --> 29:12.800
we love to always get your perspective, I'm sure there's some people that feel very differently

29:12.800 --> 29:19.440
about this whole issue, Mailbag at OrangeHonorTrader.com is the place to express your opinion, and

29:19.440 --> 29:23.140
every week here on the program we like to read your emails here on the program and respond

29:23.140 --> 29:28.840
to them if appropriate, so DarkSakura likes to read the emails at Mailbag at OrangeHonorTrader.com

29:28.840 --> 29:31.520
in our Mailbag segment.

29:31.520 --> 29:41.160
From what I understand this week, not a lot of people expressing their opinions, huh?

29:41.160 --> 29:42.160
No.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.160
That's too bad.

29:43.160 --> 29:48.920
Um, first email says, hey I'd really like the new segment and I think it's fun to reminisce

29:48.920 --> 29:54.680
on old but great games, I would actually like to request a game to be featured in this segment,

29:54.680 --> 30:02.480
Ristar for the Sega Genesis, it's one of my all time favorites, thanks, that's from Osprey.

30:02.480 --> 30:06.960
Maybe one day, I didn't really play it that much.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.520
Well maybe now's the time to start.

30:08.520 --> 30:12.880
I already have a game picked up for next week, although it's really really really obscure.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.720
What happens when you're out in November, does that mean Loki and I get to pick some

30:15.720 --> 30:16.720
games?

30:16.720 --> 30:17.720
Sure.

30:17.720 --> 30:20.240
Actually, I'll go ahead and tell you the one I thought about doing next week that I'm not

30:20.240 --> 30:26.080
going to do was Kaze No Regret, the real sound game that came out on the Saturn that was

30:26.080 --> 30:29.280
sound only and you got a packet of seeds with it.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.360
Are we going to be seeing nothing but Sega games?

30:31.360 --> 30:32.360
No.

30:32.360 --> 30:33.360
Alright, good.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.400
I have been doing Sega games lately, haven't I?

30:36.400 --> 30:37.480
Yeah, you have.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.320
You're eating some joke over there, Loki.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.320
What is-

30:40.320 --> 30:44.160
No, I was just thinking of classic games, well, they're not exactly classic games, but

30:44.160 --> 30:47.360
games I was thinking only I would pick-

30:47.360 --> 30:48.360
Gals panic.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.360
Gals panic is good.

30:49.360 --> 30:50.360
Don't get me wrong.

30:50.360 --> 30:51.360
Okay.

30:51.360 --> 30:52.360
Well, let's not ruin it.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.360
This week.

30:53.360 --> 30:54.360
I was going to say like BMX sure blacks.

30:54.360 --> 30:55.360
Define classic.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.360
It's classy.

30:56.360 --> 30:59.360
It's a classy game.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.360
Alright.

31:00.360 --> 31:04.800
Yeah, Dark Soccer is going to be on vacation a couple weeks in November, but we'll cross

31:04.800 --> 31:06.360
that bridge when we get to it.

31:06.360 --> 31:11.320
The last email is, dear OLR, this is a theory that has been floating around the internets

31:11.320 --> 31:14.240
for some time, the third console curse.

31:14.240 --> 31:19.280
Basically, this theory states that every third console by every leading publisher will ultimately

31:19.280 --> 31:22.640
fail or do significantly less better than its predecessor.

31:22.640 --> 31:23.640
Just think about it.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.920
The Atari 5200 was Atari's third system and it failed.

31:25.920 --> 31:26.920
No, it didn't.

31:26.920 --> 31:32.040
The Sega Saturn was Sega's third home system and it slowly died because producing its motherboard

31:32.040 --> 31:33.040
was so expensive.

31:33.040 --> 31:36.280
Well, also, they didn't really support it very well in the US.

31:36.280 --> 31:42.200
The Nintendo 64 did not fare well due to Sony's more powerful system and CD-based media.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.200
That's true.

31:43.200 --> 31:47.560
And lastly, Sony and its PlayStation 3, which I need not explain, especially since we just

31:47.560 --> 31:51.920
went over it, although the N64 and Saturn were pretty awesome systems, you can't help

31:51.920 --> 31:56.120
but say they did fail to their rival systems in terms of sales.

31:56.120 --> 32:02.200
I know that this argument has no base whatsoever, but I just wanted to throw this out.

32:02.200 --> 32:08.200
Technically, the Saturn was not the third system.

32:08.200 --> 32:14.400
The Saturn was the Master System, Genesis, Sega CD, 32X, and then the...

32:14.400 --> 32:19.360
Well, 32X, I wouldn't really call a system, is more of an add-on, but still, it's not

32:19.360 --> 32:20.360
the third system.

32:20.360 --> 32:21.360
Fourth, fifth.

32:21.360 --> 32:25.160
So, yeah, that doesn't really count.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.160
I don't know.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.720
I kind of want to say something controversial.

32:27.720 --> 32:28.720
I don't know.

32:28.720 --> 32:33.000
I'll tell you why they all failed because they all appeared on the cover of Madden NFL.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.160
That's why they all failed.

32:35.160 --> 32:39.640
No, the controversial thing I want to say, our emailer says the Nintendo 64 was a good

32:39.640 --> 32:41.040
system with the Saturn.

32:41.040 --> 32:42.040
I disagree.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.600
I don't think the Nintendo 64 was a good system.

32:43.600 --> 32:44.600
No, it was not.

32:44.600 --> 32:47.240
It was not a good system.

32:47.240 --> 32:52.000
The critical flaw they made in the system was that they refused to go to CD.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.920
That was one decision that fucking killed them.

32:56.920 --> 33:02.160
Did developers manage to make great games with a mediocre system?

33:02.160 --> 33:03.560
Yes.

33:03.560 --> 33:04.800
And then you go to the GameCube.

33:04.800 --> 33:11.200
The GameCube wasn't a bad system, but the GameCube also made some key mistakes that

33:11.200 --> 33:14.680
I think make the GameCube not so great a system, honestly.

33:14.680 --> 33:18.160
And I know there's Nintendo fanboys that are going to have their pitchfork and torches,

33:18.160 --> 33:22.720
but the Nintendo 64, I think, made some key mistakes, and that was it didn't go online.

33:22.720 --> 33:27.400
It didn't play DVDs, which at the time that it came out, it was really an essential thing

33:27.400 --> 33:29.000
that the competitors had going.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.800
However, I do think the Wii is a great idea and a great system, and it's nice to see Nintendo

33:32.800 --> 33:33.800
kind of go in a different direction.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.600
But I would argue that Nintendo 64 was not a good system.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.040
You mean the Nintendo GameCube?

33:39.040 --> 33:40.040
Both.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.040
Yeah.

33:41.040 --> 33:49.560
Um, I don't know, it's just, they really, hopefully, you know, with the Wii, I hate

33:49.560 --> 33:56.280
going back, you know, go online Nintendo, seriously, go online, and uh...

33:56.280 --> 34:01.200
I'm giving them a chance because I see, they're repeating their cycle of the DS, which worked

34:01.200 --> 34:02.200
for them.

34:02.200 --> 34:06.080
They're slowly, they're unboxing it slowly.

34:06.080 --> 34:09.280
Online will come into Nintendo in 08.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.880
You already see it starting to happen with Mario Kart and stuff, just like it did on

34:12.880 --> 34:13.880
the DS.

34:13.880 --> 34:18.840
Mario Kart launched the whole online thing on the DS, so, I mean, do I think they're

34:18.840 --> 34:19.840
behind?

34:19.840 --> 34:20.840
Yes.

34:20.840 --> 34:25.380
Do I think they're, you know, do I think their system is better than Microsoft?

34:25.380 --> 34:30.480
Certainly not, but, um, it's better than nothing, which is pretty much what the GameCube had

34:30.480 --> 34:31.480
save one game.

34:31.480 --> 34:32.480
Yeah.

34:32.480 --> 34:33.480
Well, there's more to the email.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.480
Sorry.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.480
Okay.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.480
By the way, you guys, you're too self-depreciating.

34:36.480 --> 34:40.320
This show is ten times better than any other podcast I've listened to because your personalities

34:40.320 --> 34:42.260
work so well together.

34:42.260 --> 34:47.000
All the other podcasts just give me the straight news with limited opinions, which meticulously

34:47.000 --> 34:49.320
sidestep criticizing sponsors.

34:49.320 --> 34:53.960
On OLR, I get my news mixed in with a little bit of Dirty Sanchez and Broadway show tunes.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.240
You guys are effin' kickass.

34:55.240 --> 34:56.240
Hee-on.

34:56.240 --> 35:00.520
Aw, we didn't have any PlayStation 3 show tunes tonight amongst all those Sony news.

35:00.520 --> 35:01.520
Maybe next week.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.520
We'll see.

35:02.520 --> 35:06.280
No, I know, but the, remember the week we had the Sony was marketing with show tunes?

35:06.280 --> 35:08.160
Was this last week or two weeks ago?

35:08.160 --> 35:09.160
Anyway.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.160
Ah, forget it.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.160
Thank you.

35:11.160 --> 35:12.160
Oh, and someone sent us spam too.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.160
We don't care though.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.160
Hooray.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.160
We don't like spam.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.800
Um, thanks.

35:18.800 --> 35:19.800
Appreciate the email.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.800
Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that we've just been doing this so long, we've almost

35:22.800 --> 35:27.260
become jaded to an extent, but in a good way, you know, we're honest.

35:27.260 --> 35:30.480
We've been doing this underground for a long time.

35:30.480 --> 35:33.480
News don't, we have to beg people to come on our show.

35:33.480 --> 35:37.480
People don't come knockin' on our door like they do for the big box sites that have magazines

35:37.480 --> 35:39.840
and all that things attached to them.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.720
And honestly, I think that's what our listeners enjoy.

35:41.720 --> 35:46.080
The fact that we're pretty much just like you, only we have microphones.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.720
I guess that's pretty much it.

35:48.720 --> 35:52.600
So anyhow, let's move on.

35:52.600 --> 35:53.600
Shall we?

35:53.600 --> 35:54.600
Back to the news.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.680
Mailbagorangeontrader.com.

35:55.680 --> 35:56.680
Send more emails.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.000
Two emails all week?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.120
That's sad, folks.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.760
You make me sad.

36:00.760 --> 36:07.920
You know what's sad is that people think that an Xbox 360 game with more achievements equals

36:07.920 --> 36:10.320
better reviews and more sales.

36:10.320 --> 36:16.840
I don't understand, I don't know, but according to Electronic Entertainment Designer Research,

36:16.840 --> 36:22.840
they suggest that Xbox 360 achievement systems, called accomplishments, I guess in the report,

36:22.840 --> 36:26.120
had an effect on the title's success.

36:26.120 --> 36:29.280
According to the press release, there is a strong connection between a game's title's

36:29.280 --> 36:36.560
diversity of accomplishment types and what the game's profitability was.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.600
I don't buy that one bit.

36:38.600 --> 36:43.800
I mean, it doesn't mean anything, to me at least.

36:43.800 --> 36:44.800
I don't see why...

36:44.800 --> 36:48.560
You don't think the achievement whores have enough of the market share that...

36:48.560 --> 36:53.040
I think achievement points get people to buy games that they would not necessarily buy.

36:53.040 --> 36:58.720
I know, for example, I bought Xbox Live Arcade games thinking, oh, hey, I can get some pretty

36:58.720 --> 37:03.840
easy achievements off there, and I would buy them and then find out, yeah, they suck and

37:03.840 --> 37:05.680
those achievements are a lot harder to get.

37:05.680 --> 37:11.080
I don't think that, if anything, I would think that the less achievements a game has, the

37:11.080 --> 37:15.840
better it'll sell, well, for achievement whores at least, because if there's one achievement

37:15.840 --> 37:19.960
to give me 1,000 points or something, all I do is beat the game.

37:19.960 --> 37:26.480
But a lot of the true achievement whores use Gamefly or one of those rental services anyway.

37:26.480 --> 37:27.480
Rent the game, get the points, send it back.

37:27.480 --> 37:28.480
Exactly.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.940
I think it's just a coincidence, and I think that's just a trend that a lot of games are

37:32.940 --> 37:37.940
coming out and have more achievements, but I don't know.

37:37.940 --> 37:41.760
It's cool that achievements are in there, but I don't think it really has anything to

37:41.760 --> 37:44.640
do with the way games sell.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.840
I don't hear reviews talking about achievements.

37:47.840 --> 37:55.640
All right, well, this game will not have any achievements, sadly, because it's not on an

37:55.640 --> 37:56.640
Xbox platform.

37:56.640 --> 38:00.800
It's SingStar, which is Sony's answer, of course, to Karaoke Revolution.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.760
There's a new version of SingStar that might surprise you.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.560
It's only coming out in Europe.

38:05.560 --> 38:12.040
It's not coming out over here, but it's SingStar Bollywood is coming out on Friday in Europe.

38:12.040 --> 38:15.560
Actually, I'm sorry, that was last Friday, so it's already out in Europe.

38:15.560 --> 38:19.720
Now, you don't have to learn a whole new language, even though the Bollywood songs, of course,

38:19.720 --> 38:21.240
I'm referring to when I say Bollywood.

38:21.240 --> 38:25.400
I'm talking about cinema from India, which they like to burst.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.440
Even in the action movies, they'll burst out into song.

38:28.440 --> 38:32.960
And I'm talking like, you want to talk about Sony and freaking show tunes?

38:32.960 --> 38:36.200
This is the game with it, because you get show tunes in all those Indian movies, and

38:36.200 --> 38:39.600
they're really over the top, real fun stuff and catchy stuff.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.600
We were watching the Bollywood Awards last night.

38:41.600 --> 38:45.160
Yeah, I was just going to say, yeah, we went to Indian food today, actually, for lunch.

38:45.160 --> 38:49.960
We had a little Jamie Robb brunch at the Indian food place, and they were watching some award,

38:49.960 --> 38:50.960
and they were doing some of the musicals.

38:50.960 --> 38:51.960
I got that guy's name.

38:51.960 --> 38:52.960
And some of it's catchy.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.240
I got that guy's name.

38:54.240 --> 38:55.240
What is it?

38:55.240 --> 38:56.240
I'm glad that you got to see that performance.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.240
Akshay Kumar?

38:57.240 --> 38:59.680
Sadly, he is not in this game.

38:59.680 --> 39:02.400
That's sad, because that was a freaking good performance.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.400
All right.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.400
But that would be cool.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.480
See, I would get that if we would get a release over here.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.400
Well, who knows?

39:09.400 --> 39:11.720
Write some emails, make some demands.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.240
You never know what might happen.

39:13.240 --> 39:17.680
Anyhow, the full song list is floating around out there, but I do notice certain artists

39:17.680 --> 39:20.520
are repeated several times in the game.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.520
So check that out.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.520
Like Calho Naho is...

39:22.520 --> 39:25.080
I think those are the actual movies and not the artists.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.760
Oh, that one makes sense.

39:26.760 --> 39:27.760
I got you.

39:27.760 --> 39:29.640
Oh, so these are the productions, okay.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.920
So there's quite a few there from Calho Naho, that movie.

39:32.920 --> 39:36.560
A song called Pretty Woman, but I don't think it's the same one most people over on this

39:36.560 --> 39:41.800
side of the ocean would think of when they think of that song, Pretty Woman.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.720
Mark Tetsuya in chat room says, we need to import this game for Loki.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.080
I don't know, Loki.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.080
Feel like singing some Bollywood?

39:47.080 --> 39:49.080
I don't feel like singing anything.

39:49.080 --> 39:56.240
Yeah, I'm actually posting that website to the chat room, because my impromptu website

39:56.240 --> 39:57.240
of the week.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.240
All right.

39:58.240 --> 39:59.240
It lives.

39:59.240 --> 40:09.400
So, at any rate, in other news, there is still going to be a Golden Axe update.

40:09.400 --> 40:15.960
It will be Golden Axe Beast Rider, which is exclusive for Xbox 360.

40:15.960 --> 40:24.360
And they are talking about them going to be a PS3 version, but it may not be the same

40:24.360 --> 40:25.360
one.

40:25.360 --> 40:27.200
But it's supposed to be a Golden Axe RPG.

40:27.200 --> 40:31.920
I heard that both of those games are coming out in the spring of next year, I think February

40:31.920 --> 40:32.920
or March.

40:32.920 --> 40:36.440
Well, that makes happy, because I like Golden Axe.

40:36.440 --> 40:42.720
But I didn't see the Beast Rider thing on there or anything like that, but who knows.

40:42.720 --> 40:46.000
That's kind of cool, at least.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.560
Anywho, so let's see here.

40:48.560 --> 40:52.960
There's some other interesting stuff that was floating around the web this week, including

40:52.960 --> 41:00.080
a mod for the PC version of Half-Life 2, which includes the portal gun from, of course, Portal.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.480
And looks pretty awesome.

41:01.480 --> 41:05.440
Of course, you know, all the fun things you would imagine you could do with a portal gun,

41:05.440 --> 41:08.360
including throwing grenades through it and whatnot.

41:08.360 --> 41:16.240
But who knows, maybe we'll see some multiplayer mods for Portal as well.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.880
Or maybe an official release.

41:17.880 --> 41:18.880
Yeah.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.440
Lots of love in our chat room, by the way.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.980
I noticed before the show started tonight, we had a lot of people in chat just spilling

41:23.980 --> 41:26.920
out their love for Portal, which is a game I have yet to play.

41:26.920 --> 41:31.520
You need to bring it over, Loki, because I don't want to spend all that money for the

41:31.520 --> 41:34.000
Orange Box, because I've been buying too many games lately.

41:34.000 --> 41:39.080
Nothing against the folks at the Orange Box, but we need to share our resources here at

41:39.080 --> 41:40.080
Orange Lounge Radio.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.080
But I do want to play Portal.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.800
I've heard a lot of good things about it.

41:42.800 --> 41:46.680
And footy monsters repeating over and over in chat, the cake is a lie, which I know is

41:46.680 --> 41:47.960
a reference to something in the game.

41:47.960 --> 41:48.960
I've heard about the cake.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.400
I've seen the ending.

41:50.400 --> 41:52.240
It does look kind of cool.

41:52.240 --> 41:56.920
Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line, if

41:56.920 --> 42:03.040
you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

42:03.040 --> 42:06.600
And I'm expecting we're going to get quite a few calls tonight, because sadly, last week,

42:06.600 --> 42:11.400
due to the outage of our internet on the broadcast computer, we weren't able to take Skype calls.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.560
So I expect double the calls this week.

42:14.560 --> 42:18.960
And boy, this is one hell of a final story tonight.

42:18.960 --> 42:22.600
You know, they've got Pokémon everything out there this day and age, right?

42:22.600 --> 42:26.140
They've got, you know, the Pokémon, well obviously, look at my collection of stuffed

42:26.140 --> 42:27.140
animals up here.

42:27.140 --> 42:30.960
You've got the Pokémon, the Pikachus I have, little stuffed Jigglypuffs, you can get them

42:30.960 --> 42:35.840
on mugs, shirts, hell, probably underoos with Pokémon on them too.

42:35.840 --> 42:40.840
But now you can get Pokémon Perfume.

42:40.840 --> 42:45.680
That's right, you can smell like Pikachu, I guess?

42:45.680 --> 42:47.280
Peek-a-poo!

42:47.280 --> 42:51.600
It's made by AirVal International, is the name of the group that puts this out.

42:51.600 --> 42:54.280
It'll cost you $15 US.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.520
Please do not buy this for your children, because there's enough stinky perfume in the

42:57.520 --> 42:58.520
world, thank you.

42:58.520 --> 42:59.520
Who knows?

42:59.520 --> 43:02.520
Actually, I wish sometimes the internet had a scratch and sniff thing on it, because I'm

43:02.520 --> 43:06.200
kind of curious, what does Pikachu perfume smell like?

43:06.200 --> 43:09.240
It's probably just some kind of like generic scent, I don't know.

43:09.240 --> 43:12.880
I think that almost all perfume smells nasty though, but I'm allergic to it.

43:12.880 --> 43:16.000
Now Footy Monster would like to point out, when I was a kid, you could get Transformers

43:16.000 --> 43:20.240
perfume Skye, it's not that rare to see perfumes of the popular franchises.

43:20.240 --> 43:23.840
Yeah, but still, come on.

43:23.840 --> 43:24.840
Come on.

43:24.840 --> 43:26.600
Pikachu perfume?

43:26.600 --> 43:28.600
I don't know.

43:28.600 --> 43:29.600
Whatever.

43:29.600 --> 43:32.120
Son of Dad thinks they should make Pokemon lube.

43:32.120 --> 43:33.120
Ew.

43:33.120 --> 43:34.120
Ew.

43:34.120 --> 43:35.120
No.

43:35.120 --> 43:36.120
Do not want.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.120
Do not want.

43:37.120 --> 43:38.120
Skype line is open for business.

43:38.120 --> 43:42.960
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

43:42.960 --> 43:46.520
Go ahead and give us a call, and everything you want to talk about that we've talked about

43:46.520 --> 43:49.880
on this week's show, or maybe there's a story that you want to talk about that we didn't

43:49.880 --> 43:55.600
get to tonight, because actually in our choosing stories threads behind the scenes, there's

43:55.600 --> 43:57.720
quite a lot of stories that didn't make the cut tonight.

43:57.720 --> 44:01.400
I'm sure Loki will be getting to some of them, though, in last minute stories.

44:01.400 --> 44:05.120
So Loki, while we wait for some calls, why don't we go over some last minute stories?

44:05.120 --> 44:06.240
Okay.

44:06.240 --> 44:10.280
There is one interesting thing, real briefly.

44:10.280 --> 44:14.320
There is a Mass Effect Limited Edition coming out.

44:14.320 --> 44:19.800
It's only going to be available online only through EBN GameStop, which is kind of weird.

44:19.800 --> 44:25.680
But I don't know, it comes out the same day, so November 20th.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.520
Let's see here.

44:27.520 --> 44:33.080
Then there was some other stuff, I guess, coming from Nintendo Power.

44:33.080 --> 44:37.160
Chris Slate, he was saying that there's going to be a brand new online community coming

44:37.160 --> 44:44.840
soon from Nintendo Power, because remember, they closed the insider forums at one time.

44:44.840 --> 44:50.840
Also, another interesting thing from the Simpsons game, which is of course being put out by

44:50.840 --> 44:51.840
EA.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.160
Grant that Scratchy's no more.

44:53.160 --> 44:55.720
They've been made to change the name to Mob Rules now.

44:55.720 --> 44:58.080
So apparently those lawsuit things were working.

44:58.080 --> 44:59.080
Wow.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.080
Alright, well we're...

45:00.080 --> 45:01.080
I just lost the call.

45:01.080 --> 45:03.240
We had a call coming in on Skype and I missed it.

45:03.240 --> 45:04.240
Damn it.

45:04.240 --> 45:05.240
No.

45:05.240 --> 45:06.240
I have a story.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.240
Alright, sure, Jamie.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.240
Real quick.

45:08.240 --> 45:13.560
Flint Dill, I guess that's how his last name is pronounced, was one of the writers for

45:13.560 --> 45:17.760
Riddick and he's working on the Sin City game and he and Frank Miller are working together

45:17.760 --> 45:18.760
on it.

45:18.760 --> 45:21.240
And the quote says, Frank and I have been having a party coming up with nasty stuff

45:21.240 --> 45:22.240
for the game.

45:22.240 --> 45:27.120
In true Sin City fashion, some old characters will return, new characters will appear and

45:27.120 --> 45:29.800
without giving anything away, probably die horribly.

45:29.800 --> 45:33.280
Well, I don't know if the game is going to be anything like the movie.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.560
I'm sure I will feel it is all style and no substance.

45:35.560 --> 45:38.960
I saw a little bit of the movie and I thought it was horrible.

45:38.960 --> 45:41.600
Not my favorite movie in the world, but it's certainly pretty to look at.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.900
Hey, we're finally getting some calls on Skype line.

45:43.900 --> 45:44.900
Welcome to Orange Launch Radio.

45:44.900 --> 45:45.900
Who's this?

45:45.900 --> 45:46.900
Hey guys, what's up?

45:46.900 --> 45:47.900
This is Footy Monster.

45:47.900 --> 45:48.900
Hi, Footy Monster.

45:48.900 --> 45:49.900
How you doing?

45:49.900 --> 45:50.900
Not too bad, not too bad.

45:50.900 --> 45:53.240
What about you guys?

45:53.240 --> 45:55.960
I noticed that last week you had quite a hectic show.

45:55.960 --> 45:58.040
Can you sort it all out?

45:58.040 --> 46:00.400
Yeah, last week's show was very interesting.

46:00.400 --> 46:04.720
We had surprise guests, surprise outages.

46:04.720 --> 46:05.720
Chris was here.

46:05.720 --> 46:08.400
Of course, we love Chris and Puppy was here, which was awesome.

46:08.400 --> 46:14.040
And then we had, the show didn't get started for 40 minutes or no, it was 20 minutes it

46:14.040 --> 46:20.640
took us to get the show started because in our studio, we used to have four mics and

46:20.640 --> 46:24.680
one of the mics started failing, which is our guest mics.

46:24.680 --> 46:28.920
And it was a microphone that I believe Eddie or Casper the Gay was using on episode 250

46:28.920 --> 46:31.560
and it was really cutting out bad, so we had to ditch that mic.

46:31.560 --> 46:37.200
And then for whatever reason, the mic cable was not working on Loki's mic, like the cable

46:37.200 --> 46:38.520
just stopped working.

46:38.520 --> 46:40.720
It's not the microphone because we tested it with the other cable.

46:40.720 --> 46:45.160
So we thought, okay, take the old cable from the mic that broke and put it on the microphone

46:45.160 --> 46:48.040
that still works, but that didn't work, it caused a horrendous buzz.

46:48.040 --> 46:49.800
And so, oh my gosh, it was just horrible.

46:49.800 --> 46:53.480
But we fixed it, we went and we got a new cable and a new microphone and everything's

46:53.480 --> 46:57.760
hunky-dory again and we're up to four microphones, which is going to be great for our guests.

46:57.760 --> 46:58.760
So very happy.

46:58.760 --> 47:03.720
And then of course our internet went out during part B, so we had no live element last week,

47:03.720 --> 47:04.720
which kind of sucked.

47:04.720 --> 47:08.880
But then we did the Operator 11 stuff, the bonus show we did for the live host.

47:08.880 --> 47:09.880
Which was really cool, by the way.

47:09.880 --> 47:13.640
Yeah, we actually had a lot of fun doing it and we're kind of doing it again tonight.

47:13.640 --> 47:17.080
Even for the podcast listeners, if you go to operator11.com a little later, you're actually

47:17.080 --> 47:18.760
going to see our Guitar Hero 3 preview.

47:18.760 --> 47:22.240
We're going to unbox the demo kit and show you guys the guitar and the changeable face

47:22.240 --> 47:25.820
plate and to show you guys all the in-z's and out-z's of Guitar Hero 3 a little later

47:25.820 --> 47:26.820
on this evening.

47:26.820 --> 47:29.720
So for those of you listening on the podcast, check that out at operator11.com.

47:29.720 --> 47:32.440
I'll definitely be there checking it out.

47:32.440 --> 47:33.440
Thank you.

47:33.440 --> 47:34.440
Is that all you wanted to ask?

47:34.440 --> 47:35.440
Nope.

47:35.440 --> 47:39.520
No, she had a little comment from the dark side because it's like, go ahead Mike, grab

47:39.520 --> 47:42.880
a little pause on Music Jam, Hamilton Music Jam.

47:42.880 --> 47:44.880
What's up?

47:44.880 --> 47:49.320
I actually played it and it's good.

47:49.320 --> 47:50.320
That's right.

47:50.320 --> 47:54.000
I remember you getting all excited about the Hannah Montana game and now you actually have

47:54.000 --> 47:55.640
it in your possession.

47:55.640 --> 47:58.880
So tell us a little bit again about the Hannah Montana game.

47:58.880 --> 48:01.280
Okay, so good news for low-key.

48:01.280 --> 48:06.860
It is not that pink and fluffy, but seriously, the only time you see the face of the girl

48:06.860 --> 48:11.760
and all the pinkness is in the beginning, like you see the splash screen.

48:11.760 --> 48:16.000
But other than that, the game is pretty normal, low-key with the girliness.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.040
So I guess that's a good thing.

48:18.040 --> 48:21.280
But what's interesting is that the way it's set up, like when you start the game, you

48:21.280 --> 48:25.320
don't have the freedom to choose, for instance, to play just the drums or to play just the

48:25.320 --> 48:26.320
bass guitar.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.200
You're supposed to make the song.

48:28.200 --> 48:33.300
So because of that, you first have to play the lead guitar and make the rhythm, which

48:33.300 --> 48:34.300
you can record.

48:34.300 --> 48:38.240
You have metronome so you can do everything and it's really like jam sessions.

48:38.240 --> 48:42.880
Like you press the D-pad and you select the chords, you have a whole selection of chords,

48:42.880 --> 48:45.680
but you can't customize the chords like you can in jam sessions.

48:45.680 --> 48:49.760
So that's a plus for jam sessions, but not for Hannah Montana.

48:49.760 --> 48:54.880
But then once you're done recording your lead guitar, which it's not just strumming, you

48:54.880 --> 49:00.080
can also pick individual strings, which is really good, then you can record a bass with

49:00.080 --> 49:01.400
individual strings for strumming.

49:01.400 --> 49:10.320
You can record a guitar for little solos and stuff, and you can even do the whammy bar

49:10.320 --> 49:11.320
and all that stuff.

49:11.320 --> 49:12.320
So it's really interesting.

49:12.320 --> 49:13.960
It's really feature complete.

49:13.960 --> 49:14.960
Is there any…

49:14.960 --> 49:20.080
The drum kit can play with two styluses if you want, so you have sort of like two little

49:20.080 --> 49:23.000
drumsticks or you can use the whole DSO buttons.

49:23.000 --> 49:31.120
Every button is signed for the drum stuff, so you can press like B and it does the big

49:31.120 --> 49:36.480
drum thingy, and if you press like the D-pad, it does the hi-hat and stuff like that.

49:36.480 --> 49:43.560
Is there like a plot or a stage set up or is it just like jam sessions where you just

49:43.560 --> 49:44.720
kind of rock out?

49:44.720 --> 49:49.800
Yeah, but you know what's funny, that you can then take your song and there's an option

49:49.800 --> 49:53.240
to make a music video, which it features Hannah Montana.

49:53.240 --> 49:58.640
You can change the camera around and make her play or make her dance around.

49:58.640 --> 50:03.480
I mean seriously, it's a feature that's not there, which you might not like, but it's

50:03.480 --> 50:06.960
so much more feature complete, I'm surprised.

50:06.960 --> 50:11.480
Well, you've definitely become the unofficial spokesperson for the Hannah Montana franchise

50:11.480 --> 50:16.040
here on the show, so I'm curious to hear if some of our listeners actually go out and

50:16.040 --> 50:18.280
pick up this game and what they also think of it.

50:18.280 --> 50:23.040
So I'm glad to hear that it was only 20 bucks, so not too bad a bargain.

50:23.040 --> 50:25.720
Well, hey, we've got to let you go to let some other folks on, but thank you so much

50:25.720 --> 50:27.880
for your call and have fun with the Hannah Montana.

50:27.880 --> 50:28.880
All right.

50:28.880 --> 50:29.880
All right.

50:29.880 --> 50:30.880
Cool guys.

50:30.880 --> 50:31.880
Take care.

50:31.880 --> 50:32.880
Take care.

50:32.880 --> 50:38.880
If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orangeloungeradio.

50:38.880 --> 50:43.840
Meanwhile, any more last minute stories over yonder, over hither?

50:43.840 --> 50:46.520
Yeah, some interesting things.

50:46.520 --> 50:52.480
There is a new Logitech PC controller that apparently worked perfectly on the PlayStation

50:52.480 --> 50:55.320
3.

50:55.320 --> 50:56.320
I don't know.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.320
It was kind of interesting.

50:57.320 --> 51:02.120
It's a cool action game pad is what it is, but it works on the PlayStation 3, which is

51:02.120 --> 51:07.200
kind of surprising that a PC controller would work on it.

51:07.200 --> 51:10.160
And then another thing, which is kind of funny, and just mention it.

51:10.160 --> 51:13.280
Apparently Gran Turismo 5 is not really 1080p.

51:13.280 --> 51:14.280
Let's go to another call.

51:14.280 --> 51:15.280
Hi, you're on Orangeloungeradio.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.280
Who's this?

51:16.280 --> 51:17.280
Hey, what's up?

51:17.280 --> 51:18.280
This is Rheoma.

51:18.280 --> 51:19.280
Hey, Rheoma.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.280
What's on your mind, buddy?

51:20.280 --> 51:21.280
Nothing much.

51:21.280 --> 51:27.000
It was actually something that I was kind of interested in asking you guys.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.800
I've been kind of on a Super Metroid tear recently.

51:30.800 --> 51:34.120
It's probably one of my favorite Super Nintendo games.

51:34.120 --> 51:38.280
But obviously one of the fascinations of the games is the speed run element.

51:38.280 --> 51:42.040
So I just want to know, what do you guys think of the speed run element?

51:42.040 --> 51:45.200
I don't think I've ever heard you mention anything about it.

51:45.200 --> 51:48.200
So what are your opinions on Super Nintendo games?

51:48.200 --> 51:49.200
I'm sorry.

51:49.200 --> 51:50.200
Run that by me one more time.

51:50.200 --> 51:54.080
You said Super Metroid and what, because you're a little bit fuzzy.

51:54.080 --> 51:56.120
So say that again.

51:56.120 --> 51:58.320
You want to know our opinion on?

51:58.320 --> 51:59.320
Speed running.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.600
Oh, speed running.

52:01.600 --> 52:02.600
Speed running through the games.

52:02.600 --> 52:03.600
Oh, yes.

52:03.600 --> 52:04.840
Speed runs are great.

52:04.840 --> 52:06.120
They're fun to watch on YouTube.

52:06.120 --> 52:07.560
I'm not very good at it.

52:07.560 --> 52:08.880
Actually, that's not true.

52:08.880 --> 52:16.880
I have, just for shits and giggles, played through Mario Brothers as fast as I can, just

52:16.880 --> 52:21.080
to kind of like, I don't want to say impress friends, because that's not really what I'm

52:21.080 --> 52:24.120
doing, but just to kind of have fun.

52:24.120 --> 52:29.300
Sometimes some of my friends who don't really get into video games all that much do remember

52:29.300 --> 52:33.240
the old NES classics like Super Mario Brothers and kind of have fun watching somebody just

52:33.240 --> 52:34.960
jam through the game.

52:34.960 --> 52:35.960
Dark Sakura?

52:35.960 --> 52:42.780
Well, remember I told you that I did the 8-1 level of Super Mario Brothers blindfolded?

52:42.780 --> 52:44.120
That was during a speed run.

52:44.120 --> 52:45.120
Wow.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.120
That's awesome.

52:46.120 --> 52:48.880
Well, it's because the whole level, if you don't, I mean, you can stop and try to get

52:48.880 --> 52:53.640
all the points, but if you're trying to have a full time, close to a full time, or by the

52:53.640 --> 52:56.880
time you get to the end of the thing and not get hit by anything, it's a definite pattern

52:56.880 --> 52:58.500
to the whole level.

52:58.500 --> 53:01.300
So that was, it was during a speed run that I did it blindfolded.

53:01.300 --> 53:06.360
I probably couldn't do it since I haven't touched the game in five years, but, you know.

53:06.360 --> 53:10.200
And certainly a game like Super Metroid encourages you to do speed runs because you know you

53:10.200 --> 53:14.000
want the bra and panties shot at the end, so in order to get that, you have to go through

53:14.000 --> 53:16.680
the game kind of as fast as you can.

53:16.680 --> 53:21.600
And some folks, folks in chat room getting in on the conversation as well, Tiger Claw

53:21.600 --> 53:25.960
says the thing about Metroid speed runs is they do a lot of sequence breaking, basically

53:25.960 --> 53:28.560
collecting all the items and power-ups out of order.

53:28.560 --> 53:32.220
And the thing about the original Metroid as well, I know you don't have to have this item

53:32.220 --> 53:37.100
to beat the game, but it helps, but the screw attack, you can get that pretty early on,

53:37.100 --> 53:40.240
and that makes the game so much easier, especially the old school Metroid.

53:40.240 --> 53:46.960
Frisbee is plugging a site, speeddemosarchive.org.

53:46.960 --> 53:48.960
And there's also speeddemosarchive.com.

53:48.960 --> 53:49.960
Maybe you made a mistake.

53:49.960 --> 53:50.960
I'm not sure.

53:50.960 --> 53:55.160
Are there any particular speed demos that you're a fan of, Ryoma?

53:55.160 --> 53:57.320
No, not really.

53:57.320 --> 54:03.320
I personally think that speedrunning kind of takes the enjoyment out of the game.

54:03.320 --> 54:08.240
I mean, I understand that somebody loves a game to the point where they can just play

54:08.240 --> 54:10.240
through it really insanely quickly.

54:10.240 --> 54:15.120
I can do that with Mega Man X. I can beat Mega Man X when I was really good at it in

54:15.120 --> 54:18.160
about half an hour.

54:18.160 --> 54:21.520
I mean, to me, it just kind of sucks the enjoyment out of the game.

54:21.520 --> 54:22.520
I don't know.

54:22.520 --> 54:28.280
Well, for me, it's just like one extra challenge in a game that may not necessarily be there

54:28.280 --> 54:29.280
originally.

54:29.280 --> 54:34.640
Like, if you look at a list of, it's kind of like achievements on the Xbox 360.

54:34.640 --> 54:38.680
If you look at a list of 20 different things you can do on a game, speedrunning the game

54:38.680 --> 54:44.480
is one thing that you can do for fun, but I wouldn't obsess over speedruns or think

54:44.480 --> 54:48.320
somebody sucks because they can't get through a game fast because there's different ways

54:48.320 --> 54:49.320
to play the game.

54:49.320 --> 54:55.200
There's also the complete anal retentive gameplay, which is me on any role-playing game.

54:55.200 --> 54:56.800
I search everything.

54:56.800 --> 55:02.520
I talk to everybody, but I finish most of those games with some type of 100% completion

55:02.520 --> 55:07.560
or something like that because I'm so freaking anal retentive in my RPGs because I feel like

55:07.560 --> 55:11.320
I'm missing out on the story or I'm missing something important if I don't do it.

55:11.320 --> 55:13.740
So that's like the complete opposite of a speedrun.

55:13.740 --> 55:16.880
But I think that's one way you can certainly enjoy a game as well, right?

55:16.880 --> 55:17.880
Yeah.

55:17.880 --> 55:20.920
I mean, I understand that.

55:20.920 --> 55:23.600
I've never been one of those guys personally.

55:23.600 --> 55:24.880
You're probably somewhere in the middle.

55:24.880 --> 55:25.880
Most people are.

55:25.880 --> 55:26.880
Yeah.

55:26.880 --> 55:27.880
Well, very cool.

55:27.880 --> 55:28.920
Well, you know what?

55:28.920 --> 55:29.920
You're right.

55:29.920 --> 55:32.720
We haven't talked about speedrunning a lot on the show, but there you go.

55:32.720 --> 55:33.940
That's why we invite the calls.

55:33.940 --> 55:37.080
They get us to talk about things we may not normally talk about.

55:37.080 --> 55:39.400
So anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

55:39.400 --> 55:40.400
Yeah.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.400
One more thing.

55:41.400 --> 55:43.840
Yeah, don't buy Boogie.

55:43.840 --> 55:44.840
Don't buy Boogie.

55:44.840 --> 55:46.520
Why should I stay the hell away from Boogie?

55:46.520 --> 55:49.000
Because it's a terrible game.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.240
What about it is so terrible?

55:50.240 --> 55:51.240
Wait.

55:51.240 --> 55:52.240
Say that again.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.740
What about it is so terrible?

55:54.740 --> 55:56.440
The karaoke is terrible.

55:56.440 --> 55:59.840
It's a very simple game.

55:59.840 --> 56:02.520
I found absolutely no enjoyment in it.

56:02.520 --> 56:07.800
So I mean, maybe there's some rhythm game, like super hardcore rhythm aficionado out

56:07.800 --> 56:09.500
there that'll love Boogie.

56:09.500 --> 56:10.640
I didn't.

56:10.640 --> 56:13.720
Or maybe a 12-year-old girl somewhere.

56:13.720 --> 56:18.360
Rababa in our chat room agrees with you, says Boogie is a doorstop.

56:18.360 --> 56:20.960
You can't adjust timing.

56:20.960 --> 56:21.960
It's a doorstop.

56:21.960 --> 56:22.960
Nice.

56:22.960 --> 56:23.960
All right.

56:23.960 --> 56:28.360
Well, Ryoma, thanks so much for the call, and stay the hell away from Boogie, everybody.

56:28.360 --> 56:29.360
Amen.

56:29.360 --> 56:30.360
All right.

56:30.360 --> 56:31.360
Have a good one, buddy.

56:31.360 --> 56:32.360
You too.

56:32.360 --> 56:33.360
All right.

56:33.360 --> 56:36.180
So a very cold review for Boogie.

56:36.180 --> 56:38.680
By the way, just be prepared.

56:38.680 --> 56:42.720
If you're going to call in and tell us that a game sucks, we are going to ask you why.

56:42.720 --> 56:44.160
We try to kind of get into it.

56:44.160 --> 56:46.600
And I do this to Loki, too, when he says, don't play this.

56:46.600 --> 56:47.600
It sucks.

56:47.600 --> 56:48.600
Well, why?

56:48.600 --> 56:51.800
You know, because there's reasons why you love games, but there's also reasons why you

56:51.800 --> 56:52.800
hate them.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.440
Well, we want to know why a game sucks.

56:54.440 --> 56:57.320
So if you want to give us a call, we'll take at least one more call.

56:57.320 --> 57:02.080
Use the name OrangeOnsRadio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR, and look, we're getting a call right now.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.080
So let's take it.

57:03.080 --> 57:04.080
Hi.

57:04.080 --> 57:05.080
You're on OrangeOnsRadio.

57:05.080 --> 57:06.080
Who's this?

57:06.080 --> 57:07.080
It's GS68.

57:07.080 --> 57:08.080
Hi, GS68.

57:08.080 --> 57:12.280
When are you guys bringing back guys on the show?

57:12.280 --> 57:14.680
Our spin-off show is on OrangeLoungeRadio.

57:14.680 --> 57:15.800
That's a very good question.

57:15.800 --> 57:17.400
When are we bringing back?

57:17.400 --> 57:20.200
You know, our spin-off shows have been having a lot of trauma lately.

57:20.200 --> 57:24.720
Unfortunately, Jamie's computer went poof, so that kind of screwed our Tuesday show.

57:24.720 --> 57:27.460
Xtifer moved, which kind of screwed our Wednesday show.

57:27.460 --> 57:29.960
Our Thursday show is still going, SDFU.

57:29.960 --> 57:30.960
Actually, no.

57:30.960 --> 57:38.760
Like, sometimes I drop by to listen to SDFU, but, like, nothing happens.

57:38.760 --> 57:45.040
Well, I'll have to get on our buddy up in Washington, Insanist, and see what's going

57:45.040 --> 57:46.040
on with that.

57:46.040 --> 57:50.800
I would say probably our weeknight shows are going to be in a bit of limbo.

57:50.800 --> 57:54.720
We're just kind of focusing everything on the Sunday shows right now, but I'm hoping

57:54.720 --> 57:58.760
around the time when we can kind of re-energize our website, because our website's falling

57:58.760 --> 58:03.880
apart too, kind of around the same time we were able to give that a kick in the ass,

58:03.880 --> 58:08.720
which I'm hoping will be by year's end, we can kind of go back to the whole spin-off

58:08.720 --> 58:13.720
shows and really being more of a station than just one solitary show.

58:13.720 --> 58:16.080
So I'm sorry to hear you miss them, but I hope they will come back soon.

58:16.080 --> 58:19.440
I know Xtifer's interested in doing the show again, so I'll get with them and see what

58:19.440 --> 58:20.440
we can do.

58:20.440 --> 58:24.240
I know Rice Princess was very gung-ho about her Less Than Three idea, and I've had some

58:24.240 --> 58:28.360
other proposals for shows I'm excited about too, and I know Jamie wants to get started

58:28.360 --> 58:30.520
again as soon as she gets her computer up and running.

58:30.520 --> 58:31.520
Yes?

58:31.520 --> 58:32.520
If I ever do.

58:32.520 --> 58:33.520
I hope you do.

58:33.520 --> 58:37.120
And you also were tossing around, I don't know if I can even say, but there was another

58:37.120 --> 58:40.120
show idea you were tossing around.

58:40.120 --> 58:41.120
Working on it.

58:41.120 --> 58:42.120
Working on it.

58:42.120 --> 58:47.320
So I'm hoping 2008, in the early stages of that, we can really refocus, but for right

58:47.320 --> 58:53.160
now we're making sure our Sunday show is staying consistent and doing this, so that's all we

58:53.160 --> 58:54.160
got.

58:54.160 --> 59:01.960
Besides, I have a class from 53645, and it takes me around 15 to 30 minutes to get back

59:01.960 --> 59:09.680
to my house from my campus, so it'll be hard to catch guys on the show if I wanted to.

59:09.680 --> 59:16.840
Well, I can tell you that the shows that don't use licensed music as a part of it, we may

59:16.840 --> 59:18.680
be looking into doing more podcasting.

59:18.680 --> 59:21.240
You know, STFU is being podcasted for a little bit there.

59:21.240 --> 59:24.920
We're thinking about it, so it's very possible.

59:24.920 --> 59:25.920
You may see that.

59:25.920 --> 59:26.920
So you can listen whenever you want?

59:26.920 --> 59:27.920
All right.

59:27.920 --> 59:29.920
Because hell, everybody podcasts these days.

59:29.920 --> 59:33.400
Well, I don't listen to podcasts anymore.

59:33.400 --> 59:35.000
I like the live experience better.

59:35.000 --> 59:39.500
I agree the live experience is ten times better, which is why we do this, and I think is part

59:39.500 --> 59:43.960
of what sets us apart from a lot of other folks that do this.

59:43.960 --> 59:50.200
You know, the live element is great, and I can't imagine doing a tape show, at least

59:50.200 --> 59:51.400
not right now.

59:51.400 --> 59:52.400
I don't know.

59:52.400 --> 59:53.400
Who knows?

59:53.400 --> 59:54.400
It's a whole other challenge.

59:54.400 --> 59:55.400
All right.

59:55.400 --> 59:59.100
Well, GS68, thanks so much for the call, and thanks for being such a fan of the station

59:59.100 --> 01:00:03.000
and calling us on our crap when we're missing out on the stuff we should be doing.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
No problem.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
All right.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Take care, buddy.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
See you.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Bye-bye.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.840
Ah, our website does need some help badly.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:17.080
I seem to remember like a long time ago we got some offer from a website design company

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.080
in our mailbag.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.080
We should have taken it.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.840
That's why we didn't.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.120
If you design websites and think you have some good ideas for us, we're looking for

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:29.840
something we can update very easily, like how WordPress will just let you go right in

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.840
there and type a new story.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:34.040
We need something easy so we can stay on top of it.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.640
We'll see.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.640
We're exploring ideas.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.380
I have a lot of time off this Christmas, and I'm going to be definitely focusing on Orange

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:46.160
Lounge Radio during that time and definitely stalking Dark Soccer and Loki for all their

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.120
help.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:52.200
So I don't see the phone ringing anymore, but let's see if there's any more last minute

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.080
stories and we'll see if we get any other calls.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.200
Okay, other fun stuff about that beautiful Katamari download content that we talked about

01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.200
earlier.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.280
They're just keys.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.740
All that info was already in the game, so you're just unlocking the ability to play

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.740
it.

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:06.740
Hooray!

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.200
You've got to love it when game companies do that.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:17.240
Let's see what else.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.180
There should be some type of ban on being able to call that downloadable content.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:25.440
That's not downloadable content when it's already on the disk.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:27.920
That is unlocked content.

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.760
That is pay to unlock content.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.960
I think we should start a movement that we are not going to refer to that stuff as downloadable

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.560
content anymore.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.560
Let's call it what it is.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.600
It's pay to unlock content.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.040
Anyway, I just wanted to start a revolution.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.040
Never mind me.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:47.800
Well, you know, if we wanted to start a revolution, we could also get rid of the micro-transaction

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:48.800
term.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.800
God, this is stupid.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.640
No, there's that too.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.320
There's this one website.

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:58.080
It's One Player Start or One Piece Start.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:02.800
Apparently, they have a comprehensive list of people who are ruining Halo 3 and it runs

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.600
down in the wonderful categories swordsmen.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.440
That's the first people, of course, that play Halo 3 that use nothing but swords.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:21.920
Rocket whores, laser lovers, children, campers, hip-slinging snipers, achievement whores,

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:30.520
deserters, heavy brothers, and I guess that's it.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.720
Heavy breathers, my mistake.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.720
That makes more sense.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.240
I guess that's going to go ahead and do it for us tonight and wrap up because we do want

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.880
to get out of here at a somewhat reasonable hour because we're going to be doing the Guitar

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.320
Hero 3 thing in a little bit.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.880
So we're going to wrap it up and say goodnight, but in order to do that, we have to go around

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.640
and get everybody's final thought.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.640
We'll start with Loki tonight.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.020
Loki, your final thought.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:58.700
My final thought is, there's a lot of games coming out soon, I need more money.

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.280
My final thought is root beer is delicious, but root beer floats are even better.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.960
Ooh, but Dole Whip floats are the best.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.880
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.680
I don't have one.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.280
Abstaining tonight from the final thought process.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280
That's okay.

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.280
No.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.280
It's a free country.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.280
I just don't have one.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.280
All right.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.280
Fair enough.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.780
Well, thank you guys very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.720
and independent radio by checking us out.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.600
We appreciate it, and it is the independent folks that keep us alive.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:37.320
So if you enjoy the show, tell two people that you enjoy the program, and we spread

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:40.640
the word little by little and end up taking over the world.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.640
We appreciate it.

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.640
All right.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.120
That's it, guys.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.120
Tune in next week.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.720
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.720
Until then, have a great week.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:54.160
