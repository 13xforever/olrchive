0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	12000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
12000	15000	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	25000	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, October the 28th, 2007
25000	28000	for this Part B of our program.
28000	32000	Since we already talked about our gaming weeks and all that stuff in Part A,
32000	34000	you can hear about my injury and all that fun stuff.
34000	38000	You gotta go back in the archives though and grab Part A because we're already in the second half.
38000	40000	And in the second half we started off with gaming news.
40000	42000	Loki, what do you got for us?
42000	49000	Anyways, what I got for you is a brand new thing that they're adding to the Wii Virtual Console.
49000	53000	It's the ability to give games as gifts apparently.
53000	60000	So you can purchase a Virtual Console game and then put one of your friends' names on there
60000	66000	and it will automatically send them a message allowing them to download the game.
66000	71000	So that's kind of cool except it doesn't address the fact that what if the person already has the game.
71000	75000	That's exactly what I want to know. What if somebody tries to send me a game which I already have?
75000	78000	Too bad, I guess. I don't know.
78000	79000	Huh.
79000	85000	I think that they should have the option where you can send, and this should be in all the online things,
85000	89000	at least in Microsoft, they should have an option where you can send people points.
89000	92000	Without having to go buy one of those cards that's taxed?
92000	101000	Example, I have my account on Live and then I have those four other Xbox 360s.
101000	104000	Say I want to download a map or something on all of them.
104000	108000	I don't want to fucking have to put in billing information for five different 360s.
108000	115000	I'd rather just send 200 points it costs to buy this map to each one.
115000	116000	I don't know why you can't do that.
116000	119000	Can't you just tie it to your Live name and then go on each?
119000	124000	No, because you have to have a different name for each one because it has to be tied to that account.
124000	127000	It's stupid. Interesting.
127000	133000	So this basically sounds like it's something that's in the very early stages that they haven't really mapped out
133000	135000	like how you're going to give the gifts or any of that yet, right?
135000	136000	Yeah.
136000	142000	Was it supposed to be some massive Wii update last month that didn't actually end up happening?
142000	143000	Yeah.
143000	146000	Do you think it'll be here in time for the holiday season which is just around the corner?
146000	148000	I hope so. I hope they have that.
148000	155000	I'm kind of curious what they're plotting because you know how Nintendo likes to slowly pull off the wrapping on things, you know what I mean?
155000	162000	Well, anyhow, the one thing that's getting the wrapping pulled off of it this week is Virtual Console in Japan.
162000	171000	The Virtual Console release has come out in Japan on Tuesdays and this week in Japan they got a little game called
171000	178000	Downtown Nekkitsu Koshinyoku Soroyuki Daikodai.
178000	179000	I know what that is.
179000	180000	What would you call that?
180000	183000	We would call that River City Ransom in the US.
183000	185000	That's right. You would call it River City Ransom.
185000	190000	I have the TurboGrafx CD version.
190000	193000	That's right. So I came out on the Virtual Console this week for 600 Wii points.
193000	196000	Donkey Kong Country 2 also came out.
196000	200000	Dinah Brothers 2 Special came out as well as Choaniki came out.
200000	202000	I'm not even kidding.
202000	203000	Somebody brought that up in part A.
203000	207000	Choaniki came out as well and then Ragai Blues Journey.
207000	213000	But what should be pointed out, I believe one of these games, wasn't that a Sega Channel game or something like that?
213000	215000	The Dinah Brothers 2?
215000	217000	I believe it might have been.
217000	221000	So kind of interesting there that, wait a minute, Sega Channel?
221000	225000	What kind of thing does this open up the Virtual Console to?
225000	227000	How about some Nintendo Channel releases?
227000	229000	Or what did they call that?
229000	232000	Was it the BS or something?
232000	233000	The Satellaview.
233000	234000	Yeah, Satellaview, that's it.
234000	236000	BS was what it was for short.
236000	242000	So that would be cool if we got the Zelda remake over here and that kind of stuff.
242000	244000	I've played a ROM of it.
244000	246000	Maybe I'm just dreaming a little bit. I don't know.
246000	250000	Well, for our friends in the UK, they get some cool stuff.
250000	256000	The coolest being Yoshi's Story that was on the Nintendo 64 for a thousand Wii points.
256000	259000	Yoshi's Story was a very, very cute game.
259000	261000	That's all I have to say.
261000	266000	And, as I mentioned in part A, Super Air Zonk! Rockabilly Paradise!
266000	269000	Which was a Turbo CD shooter.
269000	274000	They've removed a few of the graphical features to it.
274000	282000	And they have instead basically just beefed up the soundtrack a bit.
282000	286000	So, Super Air Zonk.
286000	292000	And also, Magician Lord 900 points.
292000	293000	It's a Neo Geo game.
293000	296000	I have yet to download a Neo Geo game onto my Wii.
296000	297000	I just, I don't know.
297000	298000	Get Magician Lord.
298000	300000	I kind of want it, but I don't know.
300000	302000	Magician Lord is great.
302000	305000	Magician Lord is one of those games that are like, ooh, it was so awesome.
305000	307000	And then I downloaded it ten years ago.
307000	310000	Wow, this wasn't that good. What the hell was I thinking on that?
310000	311000	I remember it being very hard.
311000	315000	That's like how Virtual Console does all of its businesses off of reactions like that.
315000	318000	Like, oh, remember this game? This game was awesome.
318000	321000	And then you download it and you're like, wait, no it wasn't.
321000	323000	That's why they don't have demos.
323000	324000	I guess, probably.
324000	327000	You know, we still need to do Super Metroid, Rob.
327000	328000	We do.
328000	329000	Anyway.
329000	330000	Let's make it happen.
330000	333000	I can't do a lot of physical stuff this week thanks to my injury, so maybe we'll have to do it this week.
333000	334000	Dude, no, no, no.
334000	336000	GS68 said it.
336000	338000	Blazing Star on Wii.
338000	341000	It's like one of my favorite ever Neo Geo games.
341000	342000	We'll see.
342000	346000	Polestar was a good game, but Blazing Star was freaking awesome.
346000	347000	Someday.
347000	354000	Apparently there's a rumor going around that Nintendo is planning on adding flash card support to the Nintendo DS.
354000	358000	Now, I'm sure that there are, many people know that there is flash card support for the DS.
358000	363000	In a not so official, not entirely legal way.
363000	374000	But they will be, the rumor is that they're going to be offering this as part of a download service that will allow you to put Game Boy and Game Boy Color games onto your DS.
374000	379000	Say, maybe via, I don't know, Virtual Console or something like that.
379000	384000	Where you can download your games using the little SD memory card.
384000	388000	Pop it out of your Wii, plug it into your DS and take it on the go.
388000	392000	Hell, they should just do that with the NES games and stuff like that.
392000	394000	That'd be fucking awesome.
394000	398000	That'd be a really added value to the Virtual Console games I've already downloaded.
398000	401000	But, of course, why would they have to give this to us for free, right?
401000	403000	Those charges to do that, right?
403000	404000	Exactly.
404000	410000	Like I said earlier, Nintendo is all about, especially with these Virtual Console releases, us remembering,
410000	414000	wow, this game was awesome, and then we'll go, no it wasn't. Same thing with the Game Boy releases, right?
414000	415000	Yeah.
415000	419000	But who knows, maybe Jamie will be able to get Kid Dracula through the service.
419000	421000	That might be kind of cool for her.
421000	423000	Actually, I'd want to play it too.
423000	437000	Here's a problem though I see with this, and I don't know how it would work, is how would you be able to say if I put a copy of Super Mario Land or something like that on my memory stick or whatever.
437000	440000	And Super Mario Land will be one of those games.
440000	441000	Exactly.
441000	447000	Let's say I put it on my SD memory card. How's that card going to know which DS it's going into?
447000	452000	For example, basically that would allow you to rip the ROMs and just distribute them freely.
452000	457000	It'd be hard for them to be able to lock that down to one DS.
457000	460000	Why can't it just beam the game over the Wi-Fi?
460000	464000	Because the DS has no internal memory to store the game.
464000	471000	Once it's beamed over the Wi-Fi, you save it to the, I don't know, maybe you link it up with a unique ID, like a friend code type thing? I don't know.
471000	478000	Well, I don't know. If you save it to like, maybe the friend code thing could work, I guess. I don't know. It would still be very hard.
478000	479000	Hmm.
479000	485000	All right, well, coming out on the Nintendo Wii is a sequel to a very obscure game.
485000	489000	I don't know if a lot of folks know about this game in the arcades.
489000	494000	I think, if I remember right, you know how we're syndicated on AllGames.com, right?
494000	501000	AllGames has their daily show, the AllGames Interactive Show, and I think this is kind of an inside joke on their show is the game Crazy Climber,
501000	505000	which is this old game from the 80s, which was in the arcades.
505000	511000	You basically played this guy crawling up the side of a building very slowly.
511000	516000	And I know that it's a joke on that show because they have that sound effect, the,
516000	519000	oh no, whenever you fall off the building, right? Well, get this.
519000	523000	Crazy Climber is being remade for the Wii.
523000	527000	And this just struck me as like very odd when I read about it. I'm like, really?
527000	530000	Out of like all the games they could pick, they're remaking Crazy Climber?
530000	531000	Who's publishing that?
531000	536000	Crazy Climber is being made by Nihon Busan is doing the publisher there.
536000	540000	Crazy Climber Wii is coming out. It kind of looks interesting from the screenshots,
540000	544000	but you actually use the Wii remote and the nunchuck to climb up the building,
544000	547000	which is kind of an interesting concept, you have to say.
547000	551000	The only thing that scares me about this, though, is the fact that they have a game like
551000	557000	Impossible Mission, or not, yeah, Impossible Mission, and they also had Spy Game,
557000	563000	what was that, Elevator Mission or some shit like that, that was really crappy.
563000	570000	Well, you can pick different characters from the game to play as.
570000	574000	And there's this one character called Fox who looks to be a foxy little girl,
574000	576000	or actually, big girl.
576000	582000	So, you know, kind of a little spin on the 80s thing where the 80s thing only had the one guy,
582000	586000	and somebody actually in chat has posted the link to the clip.
586000	589000	Let me see if I can bring this up.
589000	594000	This is a great radio right now while I go and retrieve that clip.
594000	600000	Let's see, this is the death noise from the 80s Crazy Climber game.
600000	604000	Oh, no!
604000	608000	Yeah, so that's that cheesy little sound effect you'll hear whenever the character dies in the game.
608000	610000	So, there you have it.
610000	615000	So I wonder if that classic sound effect will actually come back in the new Crazy Climber.
615000	616000	Who knows?
616000	621000	Well, I'm thinking about modding my Wii, and this comes out in Japan on December 20th,
621000	624000	so, you know, I'll be able to play region free.
624000	627000	If you don't get locked out with some future dashboard update, be careful.
627000	629000	Yeah, whatever.
629000	631000	Sorry, that's 360, but whatever, the interface update.
631000	633000	Alright, that's enough Crazy Climber.
633000	634000	So crazy.
634000	636000	Thank God.
636000	638000	No, I'm kidding.
638000	641000	There's a rumor floating around, this is all purely speculation, honestly.
641000	646000	I don't think there's much actual fact in this,
646000	652000	that Animal Crossing will be going the way of the MMO.
652000	656000	I don't think it will happen anytime soon, if it does.
656000	664000	And it's really all based off of Eguchi saying that they wanted to expand the connectivity to mobile phones and computers.
664000	669000	All of Chinese fruit sellers, you know, shaking my trees, stealing my fruit.
669000	670000	Wow.
670000	676000	Yeah, that's so, I don't even see how you can grasp that straw.
676000	678000	No.
678000	680000	If it's going to happen, it'll be much further down.
680000	683000	You know, I could kind of see something like this happening for some reason.
683000	685000	I don't know, it just seems like a very logical,
685000	692000	and maybe that's why this is grabbing all this steam around the internet and is catching a lot of, you know, whatever.
692000	695000	They've been saying it for years, though.
695000	696000	And it would make sense.
696000	702000	I mean, God, it would totally change the game, too, because on the DS it kind of felt a little bit like we'd all played before.
702000	703000	It felt forced.
703000	705000	Well, to be honest, I don't think they're going to do this,
705000	710000	because that would mean that Nintendo's actually getting with it, and we know that's not the case.
710000	714000	They're going to be opening themselves up to a lot of trouble, and you know that Nintendo plays it safe.
714000	721000	Nintendo will decide, hey, you know what, let's run an Animal Crossing BBS, and then they'll go from there.
721000	728000	And eventually you'll have your Animal Crossing chat room and your Animal Crossing game.
728000	731000	I don't know, my gut tells me something like this is definitely possible.
731000	733000	I think this could happen.
733000	734000	But we'll see.
734000	736000	It'll happen, all right.
736000	738000	In 2010.
738000	739000	We'll see.
739000	740000	Or never.
740000	742000	I'm kind of afraid of it happening.
742000	747000	If it is an MMO, I'm going to come to Jamie's Village all the time and shake her trees.
747000	749000	Who says I'll play it?
749000	750000	Oh, snap.
750000	754000	If it went the route of MMO, I don't think I'd play it.
754000	755000	What if it was free?
755000	759000	Like a Guild Wars style thing, or once you buy the game you can play it however much you want.
759000	761000	If somebody gives me the game, sure.
761000	764000	You're not the Animal Crossing addict you used to be.
764000	765000	No, not really.
765000	769000	It just got really boring for me, and I'm already playing a good MMO right now.
769000	771000	We'll see what happens.
771000	777000	Anyways, interesting rumor that got leaked out this week is that there was a new character coming,
777000	780000	or that hasn't been announced yet, coming to Smash Brothers.
780000	786000	This actually happened via one of the voice actresses' blogs.
786000	793000	Her personal webpage said the people that she's performing, the characters' voices for,
793000	800000	include Zero Suit Samus, as well as Crystal from Star Fox Adventures.
800000	806000	That, of course, was one of the ones that hasn't been announced yet.
806000	814000	Crystal, the girl fox who's also in scanly clad blue.
814000	819000	Of course, if you told me last week that King Dedede was going to be a character in the game,
819000	821000	I would have said, yeah, right.
821000	823000	And then look what happened.
823000	826000	By the way, that's too much Kirby in one game, I think.
826000	831000	I know Kirby's great and all, but seriously, three characters, two of them a bit obscure.
831000	833000	King Dedede and Meta Knight?
833000	834000	I don't know.
834000	836000	King Dedede is not obscure.
836000	840000	I know, he's not obscure, but if you think of Kirby, you'd think of Kirby.
840000	841000	What about that?
841000	843000	Mr. Game & Watch was great.
843000	845000	Mr. Game & Watch was great.
845000	846000	That was a good unlocked character.
846000	848000	It was kind of a throwback to Nintendo's history.
848000	852000	I think King Dedede is a good addition and all,
852000	855000	but I think they should have just done away with Meta Knight in that case.
855000	857000	Who's a Meta Knight fan?
857000	861000	There's a lot of people now, but I don't know who the fuck King Dedede is.
861000	864000	All that reminds me of is fucking Carlos Mencia.
864000	866000	You know what?
866000	868000	Tiger Claw has a really good point in our chat room.
868000	869000	chat.orangelandrager.com
869000	873000	Keep in mind, the creator of Smash Bros. Brawl also created Kirby.
873000	876000	So, damn good point.
876000	884000	Well, he's also created this, which for the Nintendo Wii is something a little bit unheard of,
884000	886000	which is getting people very excited.
886000	889000	And of course, there's another target Smash mode yet again.
889000	892000	We see this often in the Smash Bros. game.
892000	895000	There's going to be a new target Smash mode in the game,
895000	900000	but what's very cool about it is that you can actually send your replays through target Smash mode
900000	903000	to other people on your Wii console friends list.
903000	905000	They even show pictures of it happening.
905000	909000	So a lot of us are like, oh my gosh, we don't see a whole lot of this Wii Connect 24 thing going on right now.
909000	912000	Like you have that one random EllaBits thing and a couple other,
912000	916000	but you don't see a whole lot of this like send game stuff to friends.
916000	919000	So, very cool that this looks like it's going to be happening.
919000	921000	A real quick quote from the article.
921000	923000	Quote, this time you can view replays.
923000	928000	What this means is the game records what you did in brawls or in target Smash and lets you review it.
928000	930000	And you can record up to three minutes of data.
930000	932000	So not just in the target mode.
932000	935000	It looks like you can actually do this in the actual brawls.
935000	937000	That's going to be fun.
937000	940000	Now the next thing is we need to be able to post them to the internet.
940000	942000	Download them there, kind of like Halo 3.
942000	945000	Imagine some of the brawl matches we'd see on the site ready to download.
945000	947000	That might be kind of fun. We'll see.
947000	952000	Well, I'll tell you what is very happy for me is a zombie game on the DS.
952000	953000	I love zombies.
953000	955000	Zombies are pretty awesome.
955000	962000	Ignition is releasing a game called Teenage Zombies Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies.
962000	964000	Which is the best name ever.
964000	966000	I was a teenage zombie?
966000	970000	No, Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies.
970000	981000	And it's basically the world is taken over by an alien or something called the big brain and the army of brain thingies.
981000	984000	And so these zombies rise from their grave.
984000	986000	Rise from your grave.
986000	991000	They're immune to the brain thingy ray and start eating people.
991000	992000	That's great.
992000	994000	What exactly do you do in the game?
994000	998000	It has a bunch of stylus mini games and boss battles and puzzles.
998000	1002000	Yay, mini games and puzzles. Just what the DS needed.
1002000	1003000	But it's zombies.
1003000	1006000	And it's supposed to play out sort of comic book style.
1006000	1008000	Well, that might be kind of cool.
1008000	1011000	But it has the word thingy in it and that's great.
1011000	1014000	Maybe instead of Mario Party we need Zombie Party.
1014000	1016000	That might be kind of fun. Or Zombie Mario Party.
1016000	1018000	We need Romero Party.
1018000	1025000	You know, I'm going to stop here right there with the whole zombie teenager thing.
1025000	1029000	Ignition. What games have they put out?
1029000	1031000	Yeah, that's what I thought.
1031000	1035000	What, you mean they can't judge a game based on its title alone? What does this world come to?
1035000	1038000	Yeah, remember that other game, Monster Madness? How awesome that was?
1038000	1042000	Oh wait, I'm sorry. It was not awesome. It was crap.
1042000	1045000	We had zombies. You know what, we need a remake of Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
1045000	1048000	I knew somehow we could not get through Zombie Stories without that game coming up.
1048000	1050000	It was great.
1050000	1054000	That's what Monster Madness was sort of trying to be, but it sure as hell was not.
1054000	1057000	It failed with a pH.
1057000	1060000	Anyways, so moving on.
1060000	1071000	Some interesting stuff. Of course, not a huge surprise, but there's going to be yet another Castlevania game on the DS.
1071000	1074000	Big surprise there.
1074000	1081000	Of course, producer Koji Igarashi said the first thing we're doing is another DS version.
1081000	1085000	It hasn't been an official announcement, but we're doing it.
1085000	1087000	And that, of course, wasn't in here.
1087000	1089000	Well then that would be the official announcement.
1089000	1092000	That was in an interview with Game Life.
1092000	1098000	They're going to be doing a new DS version.
1098000	1104000	More Castlevania? Or what do they call that? Metroidvania?
1104000	1105000	Metroidvania.
1105000	1107000	Metroidvania? That would be kind of fun.
1107000	1111000	I made tonight's show roll, so I guess I'm okay in saying this and not spoiling anything,
1111000	1118000	is saying that I heard somewhere that they were actually thinking about for a 3D Castlevania,
1118000	1123000	kind of borrowing from Metroid again and doing a 3D Castlevania in the style of Metroid Prime.
1123000	1127000	That could be very interesting, especially if it has the Wii controls,
1127000	1129000	because the Wii controls on Metroid Prime are kind of fun.
1129000	1130000	So imagine how that could be.
1130000	1134000	I don't want to do that. I think that whole whipping thing might be kind of lame,
1134000	1137000	but it might be interesting.
1137000	1139000	Can you imagine Castlevania and the Metroid Prime 3 engine?
1139000	1140000	It could be interesting.
1140000	1144000	That would be fairly cool.
1144000	1146000	I don't know yet. It's iffy, obviously.
1146000	1148000	It's a very iffy thing.
1148000	1149000	It's a very iffy thing.
1149000	1151000	Well, last segment we were talking about Spore,
1151000	1154000	and of course a lot of folks are very excited about Spore and Will Wright.
1154000	1155000	He's the man.
1155000	1157000	But Will Wright made a pretty bold statement this week.
1157000	1161000	He said that the Wii is the only next-gen console.
1161000	1164000	He said in an interview, quote, somebody asked me what I thought Next Generation meant,
1164000	1167000	and what about the PlayStation 3 was Next Generation.
1167000	1169000	The only next-gen system I've seen is the Wii.
1169000	1173000	The PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 feel like better versions of the last,
1173000	1176000	but pretty much the same game with incremental improvement.
1176000	1179000	That was in an interview with The Guardian Unlimited.
1179000	1182000	It goes on to say, quote, not that the graphics are more powerful,
1182000	1185000	but that it hits a completely different demographic
1185000	1188000	in regards to how the Wii feels like a major jump.
1188000	1191000	So coming from a major gaming mind,
1191000	1193000	a pretty bold statement there.
1193000	1196000	It's kind of interesting because a lot of people call Wii
1196000	1199000	and Nintendo themselves call this the new generation.
1199000	1202000	The Wii is going off over here in this direction,
1202000	1206000	whereas the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are doing a little bit more of the same but prettier.
1206000	1210000	So it's very interesting that Will Wright steps in and says,
1210000	1213000	no, no, the Wii is the one that is really the next generation
1213000	1215000	because it's not doing the same old thing.
1215000	1216000	Shut up, you people.
1216000	1218000	Don't know anything. That's what I have to say about that.
1218000	1222000	Make your damn games and be quiet.
1222000	1223000	This is next generation.
1223000	1225000	Listen, they're all fucking new consoles.
1225000	1226000	They're all next generation.
1226000	1228000	Shut the hell up.
1228000	1229000	That's what I want to say.
1229000	1232000	If I made a new 16-bit console,
1232000	1234000	that would still be another generation console
1234000	1238000	because it has come out in this generation of consoles.
1238000	1239000	You know what? There is no next gen.
1239000	1241000	There's only current.
1241000	1244000	Next gen is stuff that doesn't exist yet.
1244000	1247000	I just like that you just told Will Wright to shut up.
1247000	1250000	Fine. Seventh generation console, I guess,
1250000	1253000	because this is, I think, the seventh generation of consoles.
1253000	1257000	Isn't technically for the PlayStation that would technically be third, wouldn't it?
1257000	1260000	No, it's in the history of time.
1260000	1262000	This is the seventh generation of consoles.
1262000	1263000	Wikipedia ordered their generation.
1263000	1265000	Are we chatting with Pong?
1265000	1270000	No, Wikipedia puts the Atari 2600 in the second generation of games
1270000	1274000	with, I believe, Coleco and some of the ones before it in the first generation.
1274000	1277000	So then the first generation would then be like the Odyssey
1277000	1279000	and the Fairchild Channel F?
1279000	1280000	Oh, boy. Here we go.
1280000	1281000	Hold on. Here we go.
1281000	1282000	I will pull up the article right now.
1282000	1283000	Well, no.
1283000	1286000	I just think that this whole classification is pretty retarded.
1286000	1289000	I'm just tired of people commenting on what systems they think are next gen
1289000	1290000	and which systems are not.
1290000	1293000	They're all fucking whatever.
1293000	1294000	It doesn't matter.
1294000	1300000	Your comment makes, so you don't own a PS3, so you don't use your 360,
1300000	1301000	I don't care.
1301000	1302000	Make your damn game.
1302000	1303000	Stop chit-chatting.
1303000	1308000	More worky on Spore.
1308000	1309000	You know what?
1309000	1310000	It doesn't matter.
1310000	1312000	I'm actually bringing this up right now,
1312000	1317000	and it's, yeah, they split this out into the different generations here,
1317000	1323000	and let's see if I can grab the wrap-up here real quick.
1323000	1326000	With the generations.
1326000	1328000	Let's talk more rock.
1328000	1329000	Sorry.
1329000	1334000	Okay, yeah, the first generation of games would be from 72 to 77
1334000	1339000	and includes the Magnavox Odyssey, Pong, and the Coleco Telstar.
1339000	1340000	Okay.
1340000	1342000	Are the games in the first generation.
1342000	1347000	Then the second generation moves on to the Fairchild Channel F,
1347000	1351000	RCA Studio 2, Atari 2600, Valley Astrocade, the Odyssey,
1351000	1355000	the APF Imagination Machine, the Intellivision, the Atari 5200,
1355000	1360000	Milton Bradley Vectrex, the Emerson Arcadia 2001,
1360000	1365000	ColecoVision, and the Sega SG1000 are all considered in the second generation.
1365000	1369000	The Fairchild Channel F was ass.
1369000	1374000	And then the video game crash of 1983 separates to the third generation,
1374000	1377000	which is the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Sega Master System,
1377000	1380000	and the Atari 7800.
1380000	1382000	Then we get into the fourth generation of console games.
1382000	1385000	SNES.
1385000	1391000	And the fourth generation of console games includes Turbografx-16,
1391000	1397000	the Sega Genesis, the Neo Geo, and the Super Nintendo.
1397000	1399000	And I just closed it, so you'll just have to, you know, fifth generation.
1399000	1400000	Speculate.
1400000	1401000	I don't want to keep reading, but there you go.
1401000	1403000	Well, hey, how about some other stuff?
1403000	1404000	Sure.
1404000	1411000	Pop'n Music Bee Mouse, the new Pop'n Music to be coming out.
1411000	1415000	It's themed after computer mice, so it's Bee Mouse.
1415000	1418000	Well, it is a computer mouse.
1418000	1420000	Wait, it is an actual mouse?
1420000	1423000	Yes, it is an actual mouse.
1423000	1424000	Take a look at the picture.
1424000	1425000	It's awesome.
1425000	1430000	It basically folds open, and there's buttons underneath it.
1430000	1431000	That's bizarre.
1431000	1433000	You really need to check it out.
1433000	1441000	You can open up the mouse for nine buttons and play a Pop'n Music simulator with a CD.
1441000	1442000	That's interesting.
1442000	1444000	That's very interesting.
1444000	1446000	I've got the list of songs.
1446000	1448000	They have a really cool picture of it.
1448000	1450000	It's on Konami style.
1450000	1452000	Definitely worth checking out.
1452000	1454000	Anything worth noting?
1454000	1456000	The song list, I mean.
1456000	1458000	There's actually some pretty cool stuff.
1458000	1463000	Mr. T, Gradius Full Speed, is on there.
1463000	1468000	Daikinkai by Desirou Gumi.
1468000	1471000	Another lament theme.
1471000	1472000	Shizuku by Asaki.
1472000	1483000	We have Megane Rock, Pop'n Music Wan, Giregire Meganidan, Sholakayo Ringoto.
1483000	1484000	I can't see the text.
1484000	1485000	It's so small.
1485000	1491000	Hachimitsu, Aneta Magiska, Orchestra Featuring Maki.
1491000	1493000	Yeah, that's what it says.
1493000	1494000	Lots of stuff.
1494000	1498000	There's Shining by Ryo and Noria.
1498000	1500000	I think this actually is a mouse.
1500000	1502000	You can actually use it on your computer.
1502000	1503000	Yeah, it is.
1503000	1508000	But if you take a look at this wonderful picture here, Rob, this is what it looks like.
1508000	1510000	Oh, good, because I was actually bringing it up right now.
1510000	1512000	Oh, that is weird.
1512000	1513000	Huh.
1513000	1515000	It's kind of cool, though, I guess.
1515000	1516000	Yeah.
1516000	1521000	So, it's a mouse, and then when you're ready to game, you can do it.
1521000	1523000	That's pretty cool.
1523000	1525000	That's totally...
1525000	1528000	I'm putting the link in the chatroom so they can see what it looks like.
1528000	1531000	Nothing in 2DX mouse.
1531000	1536000	2DX mouse would not work, especially for people like me who are right-side players.
1536000	1538000	But you could do it, though.
1538000	1541000	If you think about it, you could have a scroll wheel on the side of the mouse that would
1541000	1543000	be the scratch.
1543000	1544000	Yeah.
1544000	1545000	That's kind of weird.
1545000	1547000	Well, you know what they did for the...
1547000	1549000	Or hell, just played 2DX with this.
1549000	1550000	For the WonderSwan?
1550000	1552000	For BeatMania on WonderSwan?
1552000	1559000	They had an add-on to it that you could attach a scratch pad onto the controller.
1559000	1562000	We should get 2DX DS.
1562000	1564000	That would work.
1564000	1565000	I think that that would work.
1565000	1568000	I stand by what I said in part A about what they really need to do to innovate.
1568000	1570000	Anyways.
1570000	1573000	So other fun stuff, of course.
1573000	1577000	There's more firmwares coming out now for the PlayStation 3.
1577000	1582000	If you happen to purchase a copy of Ratchet & Clank Future, Tools of Destruction, you
1582000	1586000	got version 1.94, which didn't really do much.
1586000	1591000	I think it added some support for the DualShock 3 for that game and then maybe some other
1591000	1592000	shit.
1592000	1597000	But that doesn't matter because apparently firmware 2.0 is supposed to be released on
1597000	1605000	October 30th and will feature some wonderful stuff including the ability to turn on and
1605000	1611000	off your PS3 using the PSP Remote Play.
1611000	1613000	I don't see the purpose of that.
1613000	1622000	A new PlayStation Network category, TV category, who those of you who are in Europe who are
1622000	1625000	installing the Play TV onto your hard drive.
1625000	1634000	A new playlist for music and photo, a content group for video and game, and apparently there's
1634000	1640000	the cross-media bar customization including themes and background color settings.
1640000	1642000	Sort of like what they have with the PSP right now.
1642000	1647000	And then the Trend Micro Web Security for PS3 Internet Browser, which is a parental
1647000	1652000	lock for website viewing that will be free for a while and then eventually they will
1652000	1655000	charge you for it.
1655000	1659000	Well Ratchet and Clank also has something else very interesting in it, not just a surprise
1659000	1662000	upgrade in anticipation of 2.0.
1662000	1667000	But Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of Destruction apparently will actually tie up to the upcoming
1667000	1670000	PSP game, Secret Agent Clank.
1670000	1676000	And this was from a 1UP interview with Insomniac's Creative Director Brian Aligiere.
1676000	1682000	And apparently he says that the PS3 game and the new PSP game will actually work and connect
1682000	1687000	to each other in quote, some secret undisclosed way.
1687000	1688000	And that's all we know.
1688000	1689000	Unfortunately we don't know what it is.
1689000	1692000	Like do you unlock some like old Ratchet and Clank game with it?
1692000	1694000	Like a Metroid hookup type thing?
1694000	1695000	Unfortunately we don't know.
1695000	1699000	But we do know that the game will not connect up with other services.
1699000	1704000	Tools of Destruction will not connect to home or any other PlayStation game or PSP game.
1704000	1709000	Just the other Ratchet and Clank game that is coming out, Secret Agent Clank.
1709000	1711000	So look for it.
1711000	1713000	I'd be curious to know what that connectivity is.
1713000	1718000	I hope it's something new and exciting and not something we've kind of seen before.
1718000	1729000	Well, for anyone who is playing Motorstorm, there is a, looks like a patch to the game.
1729000	1737000	Yeah, that will actually, supposed to add vibration support for the DualShock 3 controller.
1737000	1742000	Grid order randomized for the first race in any online lobby.
1742000	1746000	Finishing positions for your last race to determine your starting grid position in the next race
1746000	1749000	within the same online lobby.
1749000	1756000	Screen indicator is added to show whether voice comms are issuing from TV or headset.
1756000	1760000	Sensitivity for 6-axis motion sensor.
1760000	1763000	Gloating index, that's kind of weird.
1763000	1771000	It gives you an idea of how well another racer is performed.
1771000	1774000	I do like how it seems like quite a few Sony games are doing this.
1774000	1778000	I like how these games kind of keep patching themselves to get a little better.
1778000	1779000	I think that's kind of cool.
1779000	1784000	I think I see that you kind of seem, it feels like I'm seeing that happen more on the Sony games than on 360 games.
1784000	1790000	Usually the 360 games get patched to fix something that broke, not often to add completely new stuff.
1790000	1794000	And that makes it feel a little more like, well, let's say World of Warcraft constantly patches itself,
1794000	1797000	and a lot of MMOs do this, patch itself with brand new stuff.
1797000	1799000	So, it's kind of interesting.
1799000	1800000	Kind of nice.
1800000	1803000	It makes you feel like you're getting a little more money for, you know, considering PS3 stuff is a lot of money.
1803000	1805000	It makes you feel like, you know, you're getting a little more for your money.
1805000	1807000	That's cool.
1807000	1808000	Right?
1808000	1811000	I mean, it's better than them releasing us download content and making us pay for it.
1811000	1812000	Seriously.
1812000	1813000	Of course, I wouldn't put that past you.
1813000	1814000	I don't know.
1814000	1821000	If I remember back to playing Final Fantasy XI, I didn't particularly like downloading the updates.
1821000	1824000	Yeah, it kind of sucks when everybody was hitting it at once.
1824000	1826000	But World of Warcraft does it kind of smart now.
1826000	1830000	Right before a major patch will come out, a couple days or maybe even a week before,
1830000	1835000	they'll actually put a thing similar to BitTorrent that will automatically run when you launch WoW,
1835000	1838000	so it slowly downloads the patch as you're playing.
1838000	1842000	And so that way when it's time for the patch to go live, then it'll send a pulse that says,
1842000	1844000	okay, time to update the game with the patch.
1844000	1846000	And so everybody already has it downloaded.
1846000	1847000	It's kind of cool.
1847000	1848000	That's pretty smart.
1848000	1850000	I like the way they do it on WoW.
1850000	1855000	And I want 2.3 already because I want my arena season one gear without having to work for it.
1855000	1863000	Although I still kind of like how they do it in Ragnarok where they do small patches every time.
1863000	1867000	And so it makes sure that your patches are all up to date right when you start the game.
1867000	1873000	That's kind of how Guild Wars worked too, wasn't it?
1873000	1874000	A little bit?
1874000	1875000	I think so.
1875000	1876000	It's just little bits at a time.
1876000	1877000	Yeah.
1877000	1879000	Cool.
1879000	1885000	Anyways, let's see here.
1885000	1886000	Interesting news.
1886000	1892000	Well, I wouldn't exactly call this news because I've been talking about how stupid easy it's going to be
1892000	1894000	to copy the damn cards for Eye of Judgment.
1894000	1897000	But apparently it's even easier than you may have thought.
1897000	1902000	The game has absolutely no copy protection whatsoever.
1902000	1910000	In fact, you can pretty much draw symbols on a piece of paper using the felt tip marker and it will work.
1910000	1912000	That's really sad.
1912000	1916000	But yeah, it's very easy to copy them.
1916000	1922000	The game has no problem reading, you know, printed out copies of the cards.
1922000	1927000	Or just if you happen to scribble in the symbols that they have on the cards, it will work as well.
1927000	1931000	So basically with a box of Crayolas, I could recreate the cards.
1931000	1932000	Yes.
1932000	1933000	Wow.
1933000	1934000	Yes, you could.
1934000	1935000	That's kind of sad.
1935000	1936000	It is sad.
1936000	1939000	You know what?
1939000	1943000	I'm just curious what the chat room has to say for this.
1943000	1944000	I will remind...
1944000	1945000	I've been having live stream problems.
1945000	1948000	Dark Tetsuya is giving a big XD to Crayola.
1948000	1958000	I will remind you though that in case you don't want to copy the cards, the theme packs are available for $15 each or $4 per booster pack.
1958000	1960000	I swear I didn't use a Crayon reference on purpose.
1960000	1961000	I swear.
1961000	1962000	Oh my God.
1962000	1963000	That's funny.
1963000	1964000	Anyhow, what's that?
1964000	1966000	Oh, the fake cards?
1966000	1967000	Yeah.
1967000	1973000	Anyhow, you know, this means we got lied to about the whole copy protection thing and I don't like getting lied to.
1973000	1974000	We all knew this was coming.
1974000	1977000	We all knew this was going to happen and this makes us very angsty.
1977000	1980000	So you know we have to bring on the FUs of the week.
1980000	1993000	And back by popular demand, folks.
1993000	1994000	FU to this music?
1994000	1996000	I'm fucking sick of it.
1996000	1998000	Done.
1998000	1999000	Sorry, we got emails.
1999000	2000000	They missed it.
2000000	2001000	Don't care.
2001000	2002000	Don't care.
2002000	2003000	Don't care.
2003000	2005000	We'll see.
2005000	2009000	FU to women for not being able to make up their mind on certain things.
2009000	2016000	For example, say for, you know, you're asking your wife what they want to eat for dinner.
2016000	2017000	And they're like, I don't know.
2017000	2019000	So you start suggesting things.
2019000	2020000	And they're like, no, I don't want to do that.
2020000	2021000	No, I don't want to do that.
2021000	2028000	We'll fucking suggest something then if you're just going to deny every one of my suggestions and fucking come up with your own.
2028000	2029000	I hate it.
2029000	2030000	And it's not about everything.
2030000	2033000	Women do this about all sorts of categories.
2033000	2035000	I'm going to give you a hint.
2035000	2037000	Just do whatever you want.
2037000	2038000	I do.
2038000	2039000	And they complain.
2039000	2045000	So there's no winning that argument.
2045000	2047000	That's it.
2047000	2048000	All right.
2048000	2054000	My FU of the week goes to my injury because it sucks.
2054000	2057000	And I don't like having a sore thigh thing.
2057000	2058000	It makes it hard to sit down.
2058000	2061000	People go, you can't sit down.
2061000	2063000	Being injured sucks.
2063000	2065000	I had a real FU, actually.
2065000	2066000	Oh, yes.
2066000	2067000	What is that?
2067000	2070000	This stupid music pushed it out of my head.
2070000	2072000	I don't even know if I have the other music queued up.
2072000	2073000	Hold on.
2073000	2079000	Let's see if we can do shuffling, shuffling, shuffling.
2079000	2080000	This is wonderful.
2080000	2081000	Radio us.
2081000	2082000	I dig through the computer.
2082000	2083000	Don't worry about it.
2083000	2084000	Hold on.
2084000	2085000	Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
2085000	2086000	I'm in the right folder.
2086000	2087000	I just need the right file name.
2087000	2090000	And here we go.
2090000	2097000	Much better.
2097000	2106000	Anyway.
2106000	2115000	So my actual FU goes towards, I don't really want to say towards my husband because I really,
2115000	2119000	really, really do love my husband.
2119000	2123000	But he can be freaking infuriating sometimes.
2123000	2137000	And I know that he has good intentions, but don't try to have a logical discussion with
2137000	2141000	me when I haven't eaten anything in like 12 hours.
2141000	2143000	It doesn't work.
2143000	2149000	And don't be pushy about it either.
2149000	2151000	The end.
2151000	2152000	All right.
2152000	2155000	Sorry, I was putting away the webcam because our Op11 time ran up.
2155000	2157000	Why are people pushy?
2157000	2159000	I don't know.
2159000	2161000	You shouldn't be pushy.
2161000	2163000	You should be pulley.
2163000	2164000	All right.
2164000	2167000	Let's get back into some gaming news because then we'll be pushing the listeners to call
2167000	2169000	in on our Skype line.
2169000	2170000	Oh, God.
2170000	2171000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
2171000	2172000	Our username on Skype.
2172000	2175000	We have a few more stories, a handful of stories for you guys before we get there.
2175000	2178000	And the first one has to do with GameStop.
2178000	2182000	GameStop, they have EB, and it seems like they're taking over the world when it comes
2182000	2183000	to mall video game stores.
2183000	2186000	And they just might be because they just opened up.
2186000	2188000	This place isn't that far from us, actually.
2188000	2189000	Jackson, California.
2189000	2190000	That's not that far from here.
2190000	2193000	Just probably about 30 miles from here.
2193000	2197000	They opened up their 5,000th store, GameStop did.
2197000	2199000	The 5,000th GameStop store.
2199000	2200000	What GameStop?
2200000	2203000	Well, to put that in perspective, and a lot of people feel that way, which is why this
2203000	2206000	news may be good news for some and bad news for others.
2206000	2213000	To put it in perspective, Starbucks has 12,000 plus locations, but I wonder if that counts
2213000	2214000	like the ones in the grocery store.
2214000	2215000	I don't know.
2215000	2219000	And McDonald's, get this, has 31,000 restaurants.
2219000	2224000	But still, to think that for every six McDonald's there's one GameStop, I mean, there's a lot
2224000	2225000	of freaking McDonald's, right?
2225000	2228000	Like every exit on the freeway has a McDonald's, right?
2228000	2232000	So, kind of interesting that for every six of those there's still one GameStop.
2232000	2233000	Interesting.
2233000	2235000	Very interesting.
2235000	2243000	Well, you know what else is interesting is that people are still making Dreamcast games.
2243000	2245000	And the rest of the world goes, why?
2245000	2247000	But I love the Dreamcast.
2247000	2249000	The Dreamcast is like the best system ever.
2249000	2251000	So Dark Sakura says, because.
2251000	2252000	Yep.
2252000	2256000	Except, why this retarded game?
2256000	2262560	The Alice Company is bringing out Dynamite Dreams, which is pretty much a Bomberman ripoff
2262560	2267000	that was based off of a minigame in Alice Dreams that they were working on.
2267000	2268000	So, whatever.
2268000	2271000	Bring me a good game, please.
2271000	2273000	I'll work on doing that right now.
2273000	2275000	The Dreamcast was so awesome.
2275000	2281000	Anyways, it's a little bit of fun here.
2281000	2286000	Well, I don't know if this is fun, but the place where every website goes, or where the
2286000	2290500	internet goes to die, is now going to be the place where games go to die, because MySpace
2290500	2294800	is launching their casual games channel in 2008.
2294800	2301120	And you'll be able to put crappy Flash games into your web page.
2301120	2304320	So I can destroy my profile with all those buildings.
2304320	2305320	Some people do that already.
2305320	2307960	I think people on MySpace have seen it.
2307960	2312000	I think a coworker of mine has Pac-Man on their profile, like a little mini Pac-Man
2312000	2313000	game.
2313000	2314000	It's not real Pac-Man.
2314000	2317360	It's some cheap knockoff, but oh boy.
2317360	2321200	Could that be interesting, though, if they had leaderboards all tied together and you
2321200	2323840	could see how you compare on these casual games to your friends?
2323840	2326000	I mean, a little silly fun.
2326000	2328880	This actually might not be such a bad thing if done right, but I don't know.
2328880	2332960	I fear that if you let users put these on their profiles, it's just going to make bad
2332960	2334800	profiles even uglier.
2334800	2335800	Yeah.
2335800	2341000	But at least on MySpace, if your profile is ugly, it's your own damn fault, right?
2341000	2344940	I had somebody make mine, but mine was pretty.
2344940	2347680	You still had the final approval, and you looked at it and you go, yeah.
2347680	2348680	Like seriously, I look at some of...
2348680	2350320	I helped design the graphics on it, too.
2350320	2354720	Well, I look at some of my friends' MySpaces and I go, do you even look at your own page?
2354720	2355880	Like it's hideous.
2355880	2358480	You have to scroll down forever to see anything.
2358480	2361000	Like who's actually going to look at this?
2361000	2365680	I actually scaled my MySpace page back a little while ago, A, so I can make it public, and
2365680	2369720	B, because it's public again, and B, so I could, you know, just not have to scroll so
2369720	2374240	much because of all the stupid pictures I had on it.
2374240	2378840	BlackLavinarChatroom says, MySpace is garbage, but don't you have a MySpace?
2378840	2379840	Hm.
2379840	2383200	GS68 says, you do not say the MS word.
2383200	2384200	Microsoft?
2384200	2386200	Oh, MySpace.
2386200	2387200	Someone left a...
2387200	2391920	I was just checking my MySpace now to see what was on it, and Neki left the best joke
2391920	2392920	ever.
2392920	2393920	What's that?
2393920	2397560	What do people go that's bigger on the inside than the out, and it's their retardus?
2397560	2398560	What?
2398560	2399560	That's awful.
2399560	2400560	Oh, retardus.
2400560	2401560	I get it.
2401560	2402560	Wow.
2402560	2403560	Bad Dr. Who joke.
2403560	2405560	That is a very bad joke in many different color forms.
2405560	2407560	But it made me laugh.
2407560	2408560	All right.
2408560	2411760	Anyhow, maybe our listeners want to tell some jokes tonight.
2411760	2416680	We're going to take some calls right now, www.OrangeLarmsRadio.com, click on interact
2416680	2420400	with us for all the details, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number if you want to pick up the phone
2420400	2421400	and call.
2421400	2424520	Have your mommy or daddy's permission because it's only toll free in the US and Canada.
2424520	2425680	Or you can call us on Skype.
2425680	2426680	That's free for everyone.
2426680	2430520	Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.
2430520	2433960	Looking at some other quick comments on chat while we wait for some calls because of the
2433960	2434960	delay.
2434960	2439700	Escapist in our chat room says, in regards to Facebook, here we go again with the MySpace
2439700	2443040	versus Facebook thing, just try to lick me in real life.
2443040	2445680	I dare you.
2445680	2449720	I'm sure that's from one of those, you just got a lick, or you just got poked by so and
2449720	2450720	so.
2450720	2452960	I don't want to go back to my annoyance with Facebook.
2452960	2458440	I actually tried to add, I went back and added some friends because some OLR people added
2458440	2459440	me on Facebook.
2459440	2463600	I guess amongst all my rants on the show recently, folks figured out I had an account.
2463600	2468760	So all right, let's head on over to the phones and we'll take a call.
2468760	2472120	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
2472120	2473120	It's Legend of Zaku.
2473120	2474560	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
2474560	2475560	What's on your mind?
2475560	2483960	Nah, just going through the usual Sunday routine, just getting playing Crysis and stuff like
2483960	2486160	that demo.
2486160	2487160	Listening to our show.
2487160	2488640	Are you doing both at the same time?
2488640	2493120	Well, if I could, now that I have a new PC to do it on.
2493120	2494120	Nice.
2494120	2495120	So what's on your mind?
2495120	2496120	What do you want to tell us about?
2496120	2501840	I don't know, the fact that Crysis is just, you know, it's not for the faint of heart,
2501840	2503360	graphics-wise and system-wise.
2503360	2509840	Obviously, you're going to need a really beefy PC to get through it.
2509840	2510840	But also, I think...
2510840	2512840	But is it a good game?
2512840	2513840	Huh?
2513840	2515140	Is it a good game?
2515140	2516140	So far it is.
2516140	2521160	I mean, it's kind of like Half-Life 2 and Far Cry had a love child.
2521160	2522160	Okay.
2522160	2523160	All right.
2523160	2531960	I mean, yeah, so far it's running pretty good for a new system that I built so far.
2531960	2536120	But you know, hopefully when it launches, it'll probably be optimized and ready for
2536120	2537120	use.
2537120	2542960	It was a little laggy from what I hear from other folks with other more powerful systems
2542960	2543960	than mine.
2543960	2544960	All right.
2544960	2545960	Very cool.
2545960	2546960	Mm-hmm.
2546960	2550480	Well, anything else you've been playing lately besides Crysis?
2550480	2556360	Just Quake Wars, another game that came with my video card, Enemy Territory Quake Wars.
2556360	2557360	And how's that?
2557360	2558360	It's all right.
2558360	2562040	I mean, it's kind of like Battlefield and the Quake Wars world.
2562040	2564880	You mean the Quake world?
2564880	2565880	Quake we own.
2565880	2566880	Quake needs...
2566880	2568480	You know, because Quake 4 wasn't all that great.
2568480	2572840	So Quake needs some good games that make me remember how much the first game was awesome.
2572840	2576560	We need Enemy Territory Duke Nukem.
2576560	2577560	That's what we need.
2577560	2578760	Maybe after Duke Nukem Forever.
2578760	2581400	Wasn't that supposed to come out at the end of the year?
2581400	2582400	Oh, fucking hell.
2582400	2584840	Wasn't one of those, hey, it finally got a release date and it's like...
2584840	2586240	No, it never got a release date.
2586240	2588520	That'd be all over the internet, Vann.
2588520	2589680	Yes, that's true.
2589680	2597520	And also, I think I heard of another Xbox Live horror story where this one guy, he got,
2597520	2603240	you know, he sent his console to get it repaired.
2603240	2608800	And then when he got the new one back, they couldn't even transfer like, you know, $320
2608800	2612960	worth of Microsoft points because they're not transferable.
2612960	2614160	Right.
2614160	2615760	Can't you call Microsoft and get that fixed?
2615760	2620880	No, that's a, that's a, that's apparently, unfortunately that's a policy that they have.
2620880	2621880	Well, here's the thing.
2621880	2627120	You don't need to transfer the points because that's, your live account is on their server.
2627120	2628120	It's not on the 360.
2628120	2629800	All you got to do is re...
2629800	2634880	They told him was that the points were actually tied to the console.
2634880	2636380	No, they're not.
2636380	2639800	It's from what I recall, it's a little bit of both is that you download the game and
2639800	2640800	that's tied to your account.
2640800	2645480	But here's the thing, like, let's say, like, let's say me and you are playing, let's say
2645480	2649240	we're roommates again, Loki, back in the day and we have one 360 in the house.
2649240	2653320	If I paid for the game and I downloaded it, you get to play the full version on the console.
2653320	2654900	But here's the thing.
2654900	2660600	If we get a new console or whatever and I sign in and download the game, you can't play
2660600	2661600	it.
2661600	2662960	You still get the trial version.
2662960	2664120	Okay.
2664120	2665880	That's still, that doesn't matter though.
2665880	2671480	That's the thing is that his games that he purchased should be able to be transferred
2671480	2675400	over because he can just redownload them again and he still has the full rights to
2675400	2680880	them because it has, you know, on record that he's paid for it and also if he has any Microsoft
2680880	2684660	points because you can purchase those points through like independent websites and stuff
2684660	2685660	and add them on there.
2685660	2689540	Like for example, if you're buying stuff for your Zune, your Microsoft account or whatever
2689540	2691120	still tied to all that stuff.
2691120	2695840	So you can port it over even if you buy a new 360.
2695840	2697000	They have the ability to do that.
2697000	2698000	I've done that.
2698000	2699000	I have a story right now.
2699000	2700000	I don't know where.
2700000	2701000	I know I saw it on.
2701000	2703760	Well, that's the story and you stick into it.
2703760	2704760	All right.
2704760	2707240	Well, Zach, we got to let you go to get some more calls real quick.
2707240	2709240	Last final thought for everybody.
2709240	2717680	Um, just, um, I don't know, just, you know, you know, just get a better computer.
2717680	2718680	All right.
2718680	2719680	Get it.
2719680	2720680	You might need one.
2720680	2721680	Everybody get a better computer.
2721680	2722680	All right.
2722680	2723680	Thanks Zach.
2723680	2724680	You have a good one, buddy.
2724680	2725680	All right.
2725680	2726680	Good.
2726680	2727680	Bye bye.
2727680	2728680	Did you hear that?
2728680	2729680	Everybody, you need to get a better computer.
2729680	2730680	Loki, get a better computer.
2730680	2732400	I did need a computer.
2732400	2734920	My computer, the hard drive or something's crapping out on it.
2734920	2738520	I actually want to get this fucking fan on this thing is so I wonder if I could like
2738520	2739520	hold the microphone.
2739520	2742360	You could hear it.
2742360	2743840	The fan on this thing is so loud.
2743840	2745480	You can hear it throughout the whole house.
2745480	2746480	It's crazy.
2746480	2747480	Hi.
2747480	2748480	You're on orange launch radio.
2748480	2749480	Who's this?
2749480	2750480	Hi.
2750480	2753200	You're on orange launch radio.
2753200	2754200	Who's this?
2754200	2756600	This would be the dark knight himself.
2756600	2757600	There you are, sir.
2757600	2758920	You're a little bit quiet, but that's all right.
2758920	2760060	We'll fix that.
2760060	2761060	How are you doing?
2761060	2762920	How are you doing, dark knight?
2762920	2763920	Yeah.
2763920	2764920	How you doing?
2764920	2765920	Good.
2765920	2766920	How are you?
2766920	2771920	A little bit happier now that I have my 360.
2771920	2774240	I noticed that you've actually been signing into live.
2774240	2777520	I was playing Guitar Hero 3 earlier today and I saw you sign on and I was kind of like,
2777520	2778520	wait a minute.
2778520	2781800	I thought he only had an Xbox.com account, but not a live, so now you're actually on
2781800	2785120	Xbox Live and all that.
2785120	2786120	Yeah.
2786120	2787120	Yeah.
2787120	2791040	So, what kind of games have you been playing?
2791040	2796120	Forza 2 and Man of 97, Man of 07, I'm sorry.
2796120	2799880	But yeah, if you were playing Man of 97 on Xbox, that would be something, though.
2799880	2803160	That means you had to cram that cartridge into some slot.
2803160	2806000	Xbox Live Arcade or something like that.
2806000	2807000	Very cool.
2807000	2811000	So, what's it like being all brand new to the Xbox now?
2811000	2814080	I mean, does it seem like there's a lot out there the Xbox has to offer?
2814080	2816440	I guess let me back up and rephrase it this way.
2816440	2819680	What made you finally decide to take the plunge after all this time and jump in and get a
2819680	2820680	360?
2820680	2824360	Part of it is because I didn't want to fall behind.
2824360	2829280	The other part was that since I do my own show, I want to kind of keep up to date with
2829280	2831560	it and everything like that.
2831560	2832880	That's understandable.
2832880	2836680	Sometimes I buy games just so I can talk about them here or what have you.
2836680	2841200	It's probably kind of dangerous, but I like to be informed, so shoot me.
2841200	2844240	Okay, so that's cool to see you finally took the plunge.
2844240	2846320	For the betterment of your own program as well as the internet.
2846320	2847440	For the greater good.
2847440	2848440	That's right.
2848440	2849440	Of all mankind.
2849440	2850440	Yes.
2850440	2851440	That's very cool.
2851440	2857040	It's kind of funny though because everybody talked about you should play it on high definition
2857040	2858040	TV and whatnot.
2858040	2868040	I admit I don't have one, but in due fairness, it looks just as good on a regular TV.
2868040	2871640	That's an excellent point is that sometimes we talk about all these graphics and the HD
2871640	2875440	TVs and everything and we forget, you know what, not everybody can just afford to run
2875440	2877700	out and go buy an HD TV.
2877700	2879920	They're still kind of pricey.
2879920	2885200	Do you think amongst your gaming experience, does Microsoft do a pretty good job of still
2885200	2888840	keeping the love for the folks that are stuck with standard definition for now?
2888840	2892400	Yeah, I mean, it's not really that bad at all.
2892400	2897240	Like I said, I'm playing Madden 07 and it looks just as good as on HD.
2897240	2902360	The only difference is I don't have that total clearness and HD would have it, but it does
2902360	2904320	do it justice.
2904320	2907560	Do most of the standard definitions games letterbox?
2907560	2916680	No, because basically it picks it up as a 480p TV.
2916680	2918480	Some games letterbox themselves though, right?
2918480	2921640	Didn't Final Fantasy XI automatically letterbox even if you were on a standard TV?
2921640	2927000	Well, it depends on the game because you have to set your console to, you can set it so
2927000	2932480	that your TV is a 4 by 3 aspect ratio and then if the game wants to letterbox it will,
2932480	2938360	otherwise it may just do full screen.
2938360	2948320	Well, Dark Knight, what would you say you're looking forward to most on the 360 now that
2948320	2951560	you're an owner?
2951560	2954640	Just messing around with it right now and just getting used to it.
2954640	2964080	So far I've downloaded some Xbox Live games and whatnot, I've downloaded Final Fantasy
2964080	2965360	Special and whatnot.
2965360	2966760	I can't get my words out tonight.
2966760	2967760	Very cool.
2967760	2968760	No, that's alright.
2968760	2973440	If you think about it, they're almost up to 100 of those games pretty soon.
2973440	2977620	For those of us who have been on Xbox Live a while, it seems like alright, we just kind
2977620	2980840	of wait for each week to see what they're going to release to see if it's worth buying.
2980840	2984040	But man, to be jumping in on that now and then you dip into the archive like, oh my
2984040	2987120	God, there's like 100 games to pick from, tons of stuff.
2987120	2988120	Exactly.
2988120	2989120	That's got to be crazy.
2989120	2990120	That's what my reaction was when I saw it.
2990120	2991120	I was like, dude, that's a long list.
2991120	2992120	Yeah, it keeps growing.
2992120	2994120	Sometimes the rest of us take it for granted.
2994120	2997200	Well, Dark Knight, we have to let you go so we can get to some more calls, but thank you
2997200	2999440	very much and enjoy the Xbox.
2999440	3003440	I hope your Xbox experiences Red Rings of Death free.
3003440	3009640	Well, lo and behold, my system is like a late system.
3009640	3013240	I think it was dated July 22nd of 07, so it's recent.
3013240	3014240	Oh, good.
3014240	3015240	Good.
3015240	3016240	Then I hope it's Red Rings free.
3016240	3017240	Alright.
3017240	3018240	We'll be pulling for you, buddy.
3018240	3019240	Alright.
3019240	3020240	You have a good one.
3020240	3021240	See you.
3021240	3022240	You too.
3022240	3023240	Bye.
3023240	3024240	Bye.
3024240	3025240	Bye.
3025240	3028640	If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3028640	3030640	Let's see if we can squeeze in some out.
3030640	3031640	We're already getting a call.
3031640	3032640	Here we go.
3032640	3033640	Hi.
3033640	3034640	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3034640	3035640	Who's this?
3035640	3036640	Yo, it's Xenocore.
3036640	3037640	How y'all doing?
3037640	3038640	Good.
3038640	3039640	How are you, Xenocore?
3039640	3040640	Yeah, I'm living.
3040640	3041640	I'm living.
3041640	3042640	You know how things go.
3042640	3043640	How are we?
3043640	3047080	Even with minor injuries and whatever else is going on in our personal lives, we're making
3047080	3048120	it to another week.
3048120	3049580	What's on your mind?
3049580	3052200	Not too much.
3052200	3057480	Just heard you guys referencing some of the old school stuff that I call in.
3057480	3059980	Dark Soccer was talking about Ragnarok II.
3059980	3065880	I touched something that looks like it was made in the same engine called Pirate King
3065880	3066880	Online.
3066880	3068420	It looks like it's done in the Ragnarok.
3068420	3069420	In the Ragnarok.
3069420	3070420	It's too damn cute.
3070420	3072240	I couldn't play it for more than an hour.
3072240	3074240	play pirate king online
3074240	3076200	It was all right
3076200	3081200	Yeah, I got that feeling. I'm gonna farm that off the farm that off the show. I couldn't review it well
3081200	3085560	Where did you know what he's a weird like echoing with you? I don't know what that is
3085560	3090360	I just want to let those people who's listening on their iPods and stuff know if you're hearing him repeat things
3090360	3095940	That's not that's not you guys. It's it's some something weird with the call actually it is you guys you just
3096480	3099560	Can't hear correctly. I don't know what that is. That's an error
3099560	3105200	I've not seen before but anyway, so so pirate king was okay was Ragnarok is a ton more fun. Okay?
3108120	3109920	That one and
3109920	3115500	All different odds and ends here and there managed to get some more points on ER kung fu and Xbox Live
3115500	3120960	But that's pretty much the only noteworthy thing. I've been doing lately. So hey yar kung fu is a pretty fun little game
3120960	3122960	It's it's often overlooked
3123080	3127440	But you know because you know fighting games have evolved so damn much since then but you know
3127440	3130200	You gotta respect the elders too. I know you play a lot of RPGs
3130200	3135220	What other kind of like obscure MMOs maybe because you know, everybody always talks about your Warcraft Warcraft Warcraft
3135440	3139200	What are the types of MMOs and and just maybe other role-playing games in general?
3139200	3142840	Should we be looking out for that? Maybe the mainstream media doesn't pay enough attention to
3143560	3147680	Well, there is one free one. I reviewed in the past called Bounty Bay online
3147680	3151400	That really looks good and it is free at the moment. Nice
3152120	3157000	It's a pirate simulator. It plays like pirates does but it's an MMO environment
3157000	3162040	So it's pretty neat. Wow. We really do have a lot of pirates MMOs cuz then Disney put out an official one
3162040	3165280	I'm thinking well, of course, uh, there's but there's puzzle pirates, too
3165280	3170800	And it's kind of all probably thanks to Johnny Depp, but I don't know you'd like to think probably yes
3170800	3175860	I'm gonna do that. But where are my ninja MMOs? That's the ultimate question. We have all these pirate MMOs
3175940	3181380	Where is my ninja MMO whether it be Ninja Gaiden or last ninja? I don't know just a ninja MMO
3182080	3184200	Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Damn. Skippy, man
3184200	3187520	We need to take our idea and patent it. There it is
3187520	3193360	I I now own the patents and trademarks on a ninja MMO watch me get see somebody probably made one
3193360	3195360	I just don't know of it. So
3195920	3198940	Well seen according to these guys anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3199960	3204480	That's pretty much it. Yeah, I'm still waiting for rock band and guitar hero 3 to come out
3204480	3210400	We'll see how they do upon release guitar instruments guitar hero 3 was out yesterday. Oh, yeah, that's true
3210400	3215520	That's true. But rock bands the one I'm looking for, but I'm waiting for the for the peripherals to start coming by themselves
3215520	3218120	I don't have that many homies around me to buy the whole set
3218120	3222400	Yeah, that's too much money for the whole set and unfortunately the peripherals by themselves
3222400	3224080	You're gonna be going into oh wait
3224080	3228480	But I'm probably gonna pick up the game because I have the guitar hero 2 controller which will work with rock band
3228480	3233660	So at least I'll have guitar and you know, if if my microphone works for Xbox Live
3233660	3238300	They'll have a microphone if it doesn't that it doesn't I didn't nobody on Xbox Live music or buying anyway
3238300	3242020	They don't need to hear me sing. I'm buying you're gonna buy the whole bundle. Yeah sucker
3242020	3246360	I know cuz I hate playing guitar here and I don't know why the fuck I keep buying this shit
3246360	3248360	I'm getting the bundle because
3248540	3253000	You guys are made of money. All right, I'm not made of money. It's worth it. If you're gonna get anything
3256420	3262700	I've cut down on my buying of 360 games, so I don't really worry about you know, I'm saving up. All right
3263700	3267580	You can buy you can spend your money. However, you want. I'm just saying 170 bucks. That's a lot of money
3267580	3269580	Oh, that's a lot of not
3269980	3277860	Really? Cuz I mean if if I don't you know go out for lunch during my work week then after you know
3277860	3282600	A few weeks that's enough to pay for the game. Hmm. Then again next month is gonna be slim for me anyway
3283300	3284540	All right
3284540	3289340	Well Zina court we got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but any of any other quick last comments
3290020	3295060	Yeah, that's pretty much it guys. I'll talk to you guys later. All right. Take care Zina court. Bye. Bye
3295060	3300820	I think it's the first time he's been on the program. Actually, I don't remember him calling him before maybe he did once
3301180	3304960	But appreciate always hearing from the people we don't often hear from but we also
3305500	3310540	Appreciate hearing from the people we do often hear from which I believe is our next call. Hello. You're on Orange launch radio
3311180	3314460	Hey, it's run. What's up, everyone? What I tell ya. Hi everyone
3317460	3320540	No, I just said because the last caller was someone we don't hear from a lot
3320580	3323860	But now we're hearing from someone we do hear from a lot, but that's alright. What's up?
3323860	3327980	Not much not much. Oh and sky. I know you're pro ninja
3327980	3332900	I'm only try to send you a ninjas versus pirate shirt where ninjas win four to three. All right
3333540	3334900	Sounds yes
3334900	3341300	Definitely, but I don't hate pirates like usually, you know in the ninja versus pirate or you have to love one and hate the others
3341300	3347040	I don't hate pirates. I respect pirates, but they're just you know, they're just inferior to ninjas
3347780	3353260	Plus ninjas are cooler. That's right. Yeah. Anyway, sorry. Yeah, what'd you want to call us talk about tonight?
3353260	3358140	Surely it wasn't pirates versus ninjas. Oh, no, I got a couple of game reviews for you. What games?
3359140	3364300	Puzzle quest for the DS and the Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass. All right, let's start with puzzle quest for the DS
3364300	3366300	Cuz it's the older game. What do you think?
3367260	3372300	Honestly, I should have waited till the game dropped to 1999. Oh snap. Not a big fan, huh?
3372780	3378260	Yeah, I am a big fan of bejeweled and a friend of mine bought it and I not really know too much about it
3378260	3379820	She said it's just like bejeweled
3379820	3383460	I'm like, really went out like a couple of weeks later and I bought it
3383460	3389900	I mean, I like the puzzle aspect the puzzle RPG element of it, but it's just that when you're looking at the game
3390100	3393940	It's like you're not sure where to begin. Do you want to build up your gold?
3394180	3397260	Do you want to start fighting the creature build up your experience?
3397260	3402220	And you just gotta be very careful in the patterns that you move because you make the wrong move
3402220	3407500	That your applause gonna hit like a five six chain combo then you're like rarely screwed
3407500	3412380	That's kind of what I like about it though, because it isn't bejeweled. I mean it isn't it isn't
3412380	3418740	I mean just adding that one small little change really kind of changes the whole the whole way you think about the game
3419100	3422740	Well, you don't want to set up really elaborate combos and bejeweled
3422780	3426940	It's all about let me make a move that will set up my next move to be really cool
3427100	3430280	But now in puzzle quest you got to go what's a cool move I can do right now
3430580	3437140	That's not gonna screw me in the next turn. I know I mean like each battle takes me about 10 to 15 minutes
3437140	3441980	I'm sitting here like scrutinizing the board if I do this, I start do that. I'll see myself doing
3442580	3445740	Two three moves in advance what's gonna happen if I do this if I do that?
3445740	3448180	I don't know my wife's not having trouble beating the game
3448940	3451840	Well, your wife has a super brain or something. No, I don't know
3452940	3457740	It's a different way of thinking about it. No, I almost got a few words for you Loki. Okay, I
3458140	3461140	Got I got there's a lot of people I know that have beat the game
3461140	3465140	But it just it's a different way of thinking about it. You can't play it like you're playing bejeweled because you'll be screwed
3465140	3467460	So yeah, pretty much it's all about the skulls
3467460	3470160	You have to look at the screen and make sure there's no
3470620	3475180	Skulls that you can line up first because if you don't get it, I swear to God the computer will every time
3475180	3478380	I know they're ruthless, but that's that's challenge
3478940	3481180	Yeah, I love unlocking stuff in the game
3481180	3484820	I mean if I could just sit there and do those puzzles like all day just kills like
3484940	3487580	Like my entire time on the train going to work
3487660	3491380	No, so maybe this game is worth a little more than giving it credit for it
3491380	3493380	But what so what don't you like about the game?
3493380	3496280	I love that really gets on me is the music
3496280	3498080	I mean yes supposed to be a medieval style
3498080	3502520	But the music can be so low that I find myself almost passing out going to sleep
3502520	3505840	I'll get that music's a little generic in the game. It's nothing too special
3507240	3510760	Alright, well tell us a little more about the other game. So you're gonna be what is a fan of hourglass?
3511280	3514400	Fan of hourglass. Ah, what about so good is it?
3515120	3516720	Yes, I mean I'm playing it
3516720	3517200	I'm like
3517200	3521800	This is so much like a link to the past to me the way I'm the way to have it set up
3521800	3523800	And this is what it reminds me so much of
3524480	3528680	Honestly, I didn't even know you controlled link with the stylus up what the game and I'm like
3528680	3535520	I don't know if I'm gonna like this but ten minutes in I'm like, okay, I could definitely rock this this this is it
3535520	3537000	This is fun
3537000	3541560	Interesting. I see I'm still not sure I feel about it. I'm gonna try and borrow it for my friend
3542120	3544280	Because I'm starting to get poor from all these games
3544280	3547880	I'm buying so I definitely want to try and borrow it from somewhere of it. That's kind of cool
3547880	3552640	Hmm, so I mean, how does it compare to other handheld Zelda games?
3552640	3558760	I mean does that does the whole stylus element just really change things for the better for the worst or just you know
3558760	3560760	The new gen or whatever you want to call it. I
3561160	3564440	Think it makes things for the better though. I mean because the last
3564960	3571560	Bunch of portable Zelda games. What do we have like Oracle of Ages Oracle of Seasons a link to the past the port of that
3571560	3573560	You know
3573560	3580400	But none of those were bad games. Yeah, but they were just kind of the Super Nintendo games on in handheld form
3580440	3585480	Yeah, definitely. Oh, could you look one second? Hold on? Did we just get it? Oh, no, no
3585480	3591480	No, I'm my roommates playing Guitar Hero 3 and I think he's on the very last song. Oh my gosh
3592400	3598080	Yeah, how funny. Oh, yeah, that's pretty hardcore. You gotta be playing that game a lot to get that far
3598080	3603960	All right, Rama any other quick thoughts? We gotta let you go to try take one more call before we sign off about
3603960	3608520	Loki's tingle costume. Yes, he'll green or bright green
3609200	3613060	Are you gonna make him a costume? I know people that will do it
3614240	3616520	You got don't get don't put the cart before the horse
3616520	3619680	The game has to sell million copies and sell million copies
3619680	3624220	But it when it does because I get the fabric for cheap by the way, it's a win-win situation
3624220	3629740	I'm pretty sure it's a darker green very similar to what link wears, but when it the game sells you a million copies
3629740	3635020	We'll send you Loki's measurements. It's not gonna sell million copies. It's told that would be
3636060	3637420	extremely
3637420	3640800	Extremely unlikely you have to admit what a hilarious Christmas gift. That would be
3642740	3645340	Well, it wouldn't be Christmas since six months from now
3646260	3651220	All right, Rama we got we gotta let you go. But thanks so much for calling in. All right, take care
3651220	3656620	It would be a fun six-year anniversary gift because over the show
3656620	3657140	Yeah
3657140	3659700	Because that it's approximately six months idea
3659700	3664820	I have to do dark soccer and I might have to go to Hancock fabrics or whatever fabric stores are out there go get some
3664820	3668420	Fabric go to LA. So just go to New York and meet up with Rama's friends
3668420	3672100	I think this is gonna be last call tonight folks. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns radio. Who's this?
3673180	3675180	It's puppy
3675980	3679860	What are you so what's on your mind? Why aren't you in studio tonight? We have a fourth mic now. Oh
3679860	3686060	You do. Well, well, I have a guitar here with me and that's what I've been busy with today fair enough fair enough
3686060	3688060	Well, how is the game? How you enjoying it? I?
3688980	3691180	Like it a lot. I'm a little bit
3691620	3694100	peed off at the amount of selling out that
3694380	3698940	Activision did with the game because I got by the time I got to the third set of songs
3698940	3702260	I had already seen like four new companies advertising in the game
3703500	3708060	Really? How did they advertise the companies in the game? Because maybe I'm just oblivious. I'm like totally missed it
3708060	3713040	Well, I live in the Guitar Center stuff for a store that I didn't notice that
3713620	3715140	too
3715140	3721820	It seemed I thought there was acts doing some stuff. They have acts guitar patterns and
3722620	3727860	These acts girls that come out and dance during some of those encore stages Wow
3727860	3734420	And then Pontiac came out and the whole there's one whole stage where it's just like the Pontiac garage
3734420	3739420	Like from Jimmy Kimmel live or whatever it is because it's supposed to be some sort of fancy music video set
3739900	3744340	Interesting and Pontiac car comes and runs you over and that's hilarious
3744340	3747020	But but at the same time I look at this and go, okay
3747020	3752020	Would I rather we have the Pontiac stage of Guitar Hero or the Yaris game?
3752020	3756940	You know here here's what one thing I've heard that they forgot to mention about Guitar Hero
3756940	3762660	That's really fucking awesome the intro and the fucking cutscenes that are in this game are the cartoons
3762660	3764660	Yeah, there's the car so cool
3765140	3769540	Why don't they just do Guitar Hero cartoon series every fucking cooler than the game?
3772780	3779300	Loki feels very strongly about his dislike of Guitar Hero over here. Well, hey, they've already done that before it was called
3780060	3786760	Legend of Black Heaven and it was an anime thing about this this like middle-aged guy who becomes a rocker again and fights aliens
3786760	3791860	It's awesome cartoons the cutscenes made me think of what the hell's metal op. What's that show on Cartoon Network?
3791860	3798500	It's a metalocalypse. Thank you. That's that's that's what the cartoon things made me think of and I don't watch the show a whole lot
3798500	3805300	But anyway, I'm sorry about because I would be funny. Yeah, so what did you we made you talk about Guitar Hero?
3805300	3807300	What did you actually want to call in talk about tonight?
3808420	3810100	Well
3810100	3817240	Other than Guitar Hero. Yeah, that's what I've been spending most of my time on but I just was wondering that also
3817240	3822720	but you know with all the you were mentioned earlier about the halo 3 downloading videos and
3823080	3824440	Game views and stuff like that
3824440	3830840	He was wearing food actually seeing a bunch of the stuff that they that had been coming out recently with all the all the funny
3830840	3836000	Little clips of like people getting killed by cones and shooting themselves in the head with sniper rifles
3836000	3836480	No
3836480	3841720	But you need to send me some of the best ones and I will simply because like I've been playing so many other games like
3841720	3846240	It was his halo because now we're getting into that, you know gaming barrage or like it seems like every week
3846240	3848200	I'm playing a new game. I want to play and then next year
3848200	3849400	I'm gonna go back and catch up on everything
3849400	3854720	So at some point I will have to go I get that but I love I love like taking the pictures and putting them online
3854720	3860040	I mean forget looking at other people's stuff. I like playing with my own stuff that I create is fun
3860040	3865800	But to be honest, I haven't touched halo 3 in about a week at least so I I need to look up some of this
3865800	3868100	Funny stuff. So please please send me some fun
3868100	3873980	Oh, yeah a bunch of a bunch of the stuff is actually on YouTube that some of the more popular stuff and it's all free
3873980	3877500	advertising for halo 3 all free advertising. Oh
3878340	3880340	Yeah, definitely
3880340	3884140	I want to say this real quick going to the chat room some comments Sephiroth1215 says
3884460	3890020	Actually, the game should be cheaper because of ads speaking about guitar hero ads but Activision is too damn greedy
3890220	3897460	So they make a music game $60 seriously. That's way too much for a game that didn't cost that much in development. Ouch
3897460	3904620	Well in all honesty all that money probably went to the celebrities that you that they had in the game because I mean they got
3905300	3906940	Slash and
3906940	3914220	Tom Morello, and I think a lot of original versions of songs too. Yeah, and like the lead singer from poison
3914220	3919660	I forgot what his name was Brett Michaels. He did all the all the motion capture for the singers in the game
3919660	3926780	What did you think of the new version of anarchy in the UK? I
3928020	3931220	Haven't gotten there. I never had heard that song before
3932820	3936420	It's the first time I think the sex pistols have been together since the 70s
3936940	3942580	To record anything. I I saw that that was an unlockable video that you could get so I might have to check that out
3942580	3947860	I remember the old song and I know the bad bad guitar freaks cover, but I'm curious about what this man
3947860	3949980	They were Monday must have been hard up for money then
3952180	3956420	All right, well puppy we gotta let you go cuz we're gonna go wrap up the show but thanks so much for calling all right
3957020	3961980	All right, right and come back to the show in the future. I don't live that way. All right, you better
3962660	3964660	All right. Take care
3965660	3971240	Escapist in our chat room says Brett Michaels should have paid to be in guitar hero 3 instead of being paid
3971240	3976900	I kind of agree. It's great exposure for these folks and in some extent. I mean, I don't know God
3976900	3981820	Maybe I'll see something controversial here. But some of these people are kind of washed up like Brett Michaels
3981820	3986940	I mean, well, he has that show on vh1, but you know, yeah, where does it make a room washed up at all?
3986940	3992820	Yes, that's true. That's you don't vh1. That's pretty much the definition of wash. Let me and true true and
3993580	3996620	you know, I don't know slash is a great guitarist, but
3997340	4001540	Not the mainstream doesn't talk about slash but now they might so you're right
4001540	4004560	These guys maybe ought to be paying them to be in the game. Who knows?
4004560	4010540	Anyhow, we've been going at this a long time. So I think it's finally time to wrap this up and call it a night
4010600	4012880	So we're gonna go around and get everybody's
4013440	4017360	Final thought actually, I do we didn't get last minute stories. They may have more than getting last minute
4017360	4022680	I'm sorry, then let's get last minute stories real quick. Anyways, um, so a few things first off
4024360	4028320	Let's see game stops drop their Xbox 360 product replacement plans
4028320	4034220	So apparently now they're no longer fixing those. I guess Microsoft will have to do more of that
4035300	4037220	Let's see here
4037220	4042280	Grip shift has been rated for the Xbox 360 if you might remember that was like crappy ass game
4042420	4046060	They came out on the PlayStation Network and also on the PSP
4046060	4052460	I highly recommend if it does come out on live arcade do not fucking buy it. It's horrible horrible horrible
4052460	4060540	That crappy Xbox live arcade game stick is now 50% cheaper in the UK still shouldn't buy it though
4061340	4068460	There is a wonderful application made by Microsoft. I guess employee Adam Keener or Kenny
4069020	4070340	Kenny
4070340	4078080	Anyways, it's Xbox live friend tracker. It's a little sidebar program that you run in Windows that will allow you to
4078080	4085080	Track your friends on live kind of fun. There was a new we channel that was announced that kind of got
4086080	4089080	under the radar here apparently the
4090080	4096560	Channel is nicknamed as a TV program schedule channel. In other words, it's a channel where you can find out what's on TV
4096560	4102080	I don't know about I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure on most cable networks
4102080	4107080	Especially if it's satellite or digital cable. There's a guide button on your remote
4107080	4113080	To see what's on TV. Do we really need this on here and people are speculating?
4113080	4118440	Oh, it's gonna lead to an lead to an IP TV channel. Yeah, where the fuck are you gonna store that shit on the Wii?
4118520	4120520	That's what I'd like to know
4121080	4124080	If you're ordering Super Mario Galaxy
4124080	4129440	You ain't getting your pre-order coin until the fucking game comes out not that you really should order the game
4129800	4136020	Because of that coin also might remind you that that game is gonna be fucking hard to find around holidays
4136020	4137560	So if you haven't pre-ordered it yet
4137560	4143700	It's time to do it because it's gonna be like the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess where it's near impossible to find
4144440	4151360	And then finally Gran Turismo 5 they've had some of the features announced for it including there's gonna be an online
4151760	4157820	Garage course online head-to-head racing time trials track of the day be spec race
4157820	4165620	a license test drift contest tuning and setting features friends lists Lobby voice chat bulletin board
4166220	4167900	spectator mode
4167900	4170000	team building club building
4171420	4176140	Color and other editors and looks like some other fun stuff
4176140	4183940	So photo albums also lots of wonderful features at for game that's not going to come out until Christmas of next year if that oh
4183940	4190660	Oh, and by the way, there's also something fun in the little Sears ad that was on go
4190860	4194580	Nintendo dot-com and I tell you this also tickles me
4195140	4197140	Rose and gold as well
4198500	4205460	Nice in other words it also they basically have the two DS light bundles one with triforces on it one with a paw print
4205660	4210380	the one the triforce is gold comes with Zelda the one of the paw print comes with a special edition of
4211500	4213180	intend dogs
4213180	4215180	another Nintendo one for
4215900	4218380	149 99 each nice
4219260	4221260	There you have it. There you go
4221340	4227540	Do you have anything to our sara for last-minute stories? I have hunger you have hunger I hunger I
