487	5573	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5893	14743	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15464	19088	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20074	27736	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, October the 28th, 2007 for this Part B of our program.
27796	34437	And since we already talked about our gaming weeks and all that stuff in Part A, you can hear about my injury and all that fun stuff.
34537	37818	You've got to go back in the archives, though, and grab Part A because we're already in the second half.
38218	40398	And in the second half, we started off with gaming news.
40538	41478	Loki, what do you got for us?
41918	44919	Anyways, what I got for you is a...
45692	49254	Brand new thing they're adding to the Wii Virtual Console.
49274	53095	It's the ability to give games as gifts, apparently.
53235	63960	So you can purchase a Virtual Console game and then put one of your friend's names on there and it will automatically send them a message allowing them to download the game.
66301	71224	So that's kind of cool, except it doesn't address the fact that what if the person already has the game?
71244	72324	That's exactly what I want to know.
72364	74385	What if somebody tries to send me a game which I already have?
75083	76124	Too bad, I guess.
76364	76704	I don't know.
79486	89151	I think that they should have the option where you can send, and this should be in all, I think, the online things, at least Microsoft, they should have an option where you can send people points.
89871	91933	Without having to go buy one of those cards that's taxed?
91993	93593	Example.
93854	99037	I have my account on Live, and then I have those four other Xbox 360s.
99117	99557	Say I want to
102438	104079	Download a map or something on all of them.
104179	108781	I don't want to fucking have to put in billing information for five different 360s.
108961	115063	I'd rather just send the 200 points it costs to buy this map to each one.
115703	116724	I don't know why you can't do that.
116744	118964	Can't you just tie it to your live name and then go on each?
119385	121686	No, because you have to have a different name for each one.
122546	123846	You have to be tied to that account.
124607	125227	It's stupid.
126351	126711	Interesting.
127111	127411	But yeah.
127752	135154	So this basically sounds like it's something that's in the very early stages that they haven't really mapped out how you're going to give the gifts or any of that yet, right?
135775	135935	Yeah.
136055	141537	Wasn't there supposed to be some massive Wii update last month that didn't actually end up happening?
141917	142157	Yeah.
143277	145958	Do you think it'll be here in time for the holiday season, which is just around the corner?
145978	146179	I hope so.
146539	147339	I hope they have that.
147359	154222	I'm kind of curious what they're plotting, because you know how Nintendo likes to slowly pull off the wrapping on things, you know what I mean?
155122	155222	Hmm.
156308	162354	Well, anyhow, one thing that's getting the wrapping pulled off of it this week is Virtual Console in Japan.
162414	164937	And the Virtual Console releases come out in Japan on Tuesdays.
165357	177829	And this week in Japan, they got a little game called Downtown Nekitsu Koshinyoku Soriyuki Dayo Kodai.
178070	179111	I know what that is.
179431	180372	And what would you call that?
180831	181732	River City Ransom
190549	191390	I believe it might have been.
217463	220545	So kind of interesting there that... Wait a minute, Sega Channel?
221326	225389	Hmm, what kind of thing does this open up the Virtual Console to?
225429	227070	How about some Nintendo Channel releases?
227770	228811	Or what do they call that?
228931	232053	The... Was it the BS or something?
232073	233074	Just the Teleview.
233174	234395	Yeah, it's Teleview, that's it.
234555	235776	BS is what it was for short.
236356	243721	So, um... That would be cool if we got like the Zelda remake over here and that kind of stuff, but... I've played a ROM of it.
243921	246103	Maybe I'm just dreaming a little bit, I don't know.
246986	250147	Well, for our friends in the UK, they get some cool stuff.
251227	255568	The coolest being Yoshi's Story that was on the Nintendo 64 for 1,000 Wii Points.
257128	259248	Yoshi's Story was a very, very cute game.
259508	260428	That's all I have to say.
262009	264649	And, as I mentioned in Part A, Super Air Zonk!
264749	269190	Rockabilly Paradise, which was a Turbo CD shooter.
270210	274151	They've removed a few of the graphical features to it.
275530	300102	and they have uh instead uh basically just beefed up the soundtrack a bit so super Arizona and also magician lord 900 points it's a neo geo game i have yet to download a neo geo game onto my wii i just i don't know i get magician lord i kind of want it but i don't know like
301362	306405	Magician Lord is one of those games that are like, ooh, it was so awesome, and then I downloaded it.
306425	306806	Ten years ago.
306826	308047	Wow, this wasn't that good.
308067	309648	What the hell was I thinking on that?
310008	311289	I remember it being very hard.
311309	315431	That's like how Virtual Console does all of its business, is off of reactions like that.
315491	316932	Like, oh, remember this game?
316952	317893	This game was awesome.
318193	320554	And then you download it, and you're like, wait, no it wasn't.
321035	322336	That's why they don't have demos.
323576	324597	I guess, probably.
324757	326638	You know, we still need to do Super Metroid, Rob.
327159	327499	We do.
327519	329220	Let's make it happen.
329240	329380	Anyways.
330230	333773	I can't do a lot of physical stuff this week thanks to my injury, so maybe we'll have to do it this week.
333793	335394	Dude, no, no, no, GS68 said it.
336055	337116	Blazing Star on Wii.
337136	341079	It's like one of my favorite ever Neo Geo games.
341599	345062	Polestar was a good game, but Blazing Star was freaking awesome.
346183	346503	Someday.
346743	354229	Apparently there's a rumor going around that Nintendo is planning on adding flash card support to the Nintendo DS.
354289	357992	Now, I'm sure that many people know that there is flash card support for the DS online,
358464	362507	in a not-so-official, not-entirely-legal way.
363428	387448	But the rumor is that they're going to be offering this as part of a download service that will allow you to put Game Boy and Game Boy Color games onto your DS, say, maybe via, I don't know, Virtual Console or something like that, where you can download your games using the little SD memory card, pop it out of your Wii, plug it into your DS, and take it on the go.
388797	389478	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
415676	443137	but who knows, maybe Jamie will be able to get Kid Dracula through the service that might be kind of cool for her actually I'd want to play it too here's a problem though I see with this and I don't know how it would work is how would you be able to say if I put a copy of Super Mario Land or something like that on my memory stick or whatever and Super Mario Land will be one of those games and I'm sure it was better when I was a kid let's say I put it on my SD memory card
443493	446455	How's that card going to know which DS is going into?
446875	451479	For example, basically that would allow you to rip the ROMs and just distribute them freely.
452579	456442	It would be hard for them to be able to lock that down to one DS.
457303	459244	Why can't it just beam the game over the Wi-Fi?
460505	463947	Because the DS has no internal memory to store the game.
464007	466589	And then once it's beamed over the Wi-Fi, you save it to the...
467227	467607	I don't know.
467767	470488	Maybe you link it up with a unique ID, like a friend code type thing?
470508	470968	I don't know.
470988	471528	Well, I don't know.
471568	475670	If you save it to, like... Maybe the friend code thing could work, I guess.
475890	476290	I don't know.
476430	477531	It would still be very hard.
478211	478411	Hmm.
479831	480171	All right.
480231	485593	Well, coming out on the Nintendo Wii is a sequel to a very obscure game.
485633	487214	I don't know if a lot of folks know about this...
488206	489047	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
507996	518422	And I know it's a joke on that show because they have that sound effect, the, oh no, whenever you fall off the building, right?
518702	519263	Well, get this.
519923	522364	Crazy Climber is being remade for the Wii.
523745	526206	And this just struck me as very odd when I read about it.
526226	526707	I'm like, really?
526807	527087	Really?
527731	530371	Out of all the games they could pick, they're remaking Crazy Climber.
530411	531412	Who's publishing that?
531832	536012	Crazy Climber is being made by Nihon Busan is doing the publisher there.
537413	538353	Crazy Climber Wii is coming out.
538373	547074	It kind of looks interesting from the screenshots, but you actually use the Wii remote and the nunchuck to climb up the building, which is kind of an interesting concept, you have to say.
547094	553976	The only thing that scares me about this, though, is the fact that they have a game like Impossible Mission and they also had Spy Game
557555	558136	What was that?
558256	560598	Elevator Mission or some shit like that?
560878	562099	That was really crappy.
563320	569445	Well, you can pick different characters from the game to play as.
570146	574069	And there's this one character called Fox who looks to be a foxy little girl.
574249	575510	Or actually, big girl.
576031	582016	So, you know, kind of a little spin on the 80s thing where the 80s thing only had the one guy.
582556	585679	And somebody actually in chat has posted the link to the clip.
586294	586454	Oh, no!
586474	586955	Crazy Climber
615907	624052	Well, I'm thinking about modding my Wii, and this comes out in Japan on December 20th, so, you know, I'll be able to play Region 3 soon.
624092	629235	If you don't get locked out with some future dashboard update, be careful, or whatever they call it.
629255	630816	Sorry, that was 360, but whatever, the interface update.
631336	632537	Alright, that's enough Crazy Climber.
633457	634158	So crazy.
634178	635158	Thank God.
636559	637160	No, I'm kidding.
638120	642623	There's rumor floating around, this is all purely speculation, honestly, I don't think there's much...
644125	651126	Actual fact in this, that Animal Crossing will be going the way of the MMO.
652427	655247	I don't think it will happen anytime soon.
655367	663709	If it does, and it's really all based off of Eguchi saying that they wanted to expand the connectivity to mobile phones and computers.
664109	668289	All Chinese fruit sellers, you know, shaking my tree, stealing my fruit.
669250	669690	Wow.
670370	671370	Yeah, that's so...
672014	675236	I don't even see how you can grasp that straw.
676377	676557	No.
677858	679839	If it's going to happen, it'll be much further down.
680019	683321	You know, I could kind of see something like this happening for some reason.
683421	691306	I don't know, it just seems like a very logical, and maybe that's why this is grabbing all this steam around the internet and is catching a lot of, you know, whatever.
692607	694288	They've been saying it for years, though.
695149	696130	and it would make sense.
696390	701814	I mean, God, it would totally change the game too because on the DS it kind of felt like a little bit like we've all played before.
701834	702414	It felt forced.
702995	709739	Well, to be honest, I don't think they're going to do this because that would mean that Nintendo's actually getting with it and we know that's not the case.
709759	713902	They're going to be opening themselves up to a lot of trouble and you know that Nintendo plays it safe.
714663	722088	Nintendo will decide, hey, you know what, let's run an Animal Crossing BBS and then they'll go from there and then eventually you'll have like your
723160	727983	Animal Crossing chat room and your Animal Crossing game.
728463	728803	I don't know.
728863	731184	My gut tells me something like this is definitely possible.
731364	732165	I think this could happen.
733245	733686	But we'll see.
734126	735086	It'll happen, all right.
736207	736667	In 2010.
738308	738668	We'll see.
739168	739769	Or never.
740229	741710	I'm kind of afraid of it happening.
742610	746412	If it is an MMO, I'm going to come to Jamie's Village all the time and shake her trees.
747493	748233	Who says I'll play it?
748833	749414	Oh, snap.
750638	753440	I don't think I... You know, if it went the route of MMO, I don't think I'd play it.
753900	754621	What if it was free?
754941	758784	Like a Guild Wars-style thing, where once you buy the game, you can play it however much you want.
758824	760105	If somebody gives me the game, sure.
760786	760926	Ooh.
761806	763568	You're not the Animal Crossing addict you used to be.
763708	764428	No, not really.
764608	768491	It just got really boring for me, and I'm already playing a good MMO right now.
768511	769832	Ooh, we'll see what happens.
770773	775737	Anyways, interesting rumor that got leaked out this week is that there was a new character...
776909	778070	Coming to Smash Bros.
806701	814327	Crystal, the girl fox who's also in scantily clad blue... Yeah.
814988	820472	Of course, you know, if you told me last week that King Dedede was going to be a character in the game, I would have said, yeah, right.
821573	822394	And then look what happened.
823075	823235	Yeah.
823755	825857	By the way, that's too much Kirby in one game, I think.
825917	833023	I mean, I know Kirby's great and all, but seriously, three characters, two of them a bit obscure, King Dedede and Meta Knight...
833905	834265	I don't know.
834325	835706	King Dedede's not obscure.
835906	839427	I know, he's not obscure, but... Mr. Play and Watch, I mean... What about Kirby?
839847	840387	What about that?
841068	842228	Mr. Play and Watch was great.
842248	843268	Or Game and Watch, I'm sorry.
843288	844789	Mr. Game and Watch was great.
844809	846089	That was a good unlocked character.
846109	847950	It was kind of a throwback to Nintendo's history.
847990	854612	But I just don't... I honestly think if they... I think King Dedede's a good addition and all, but I think they should have just done away with Meta Knight in that case.
854712	856533	Like, who's a Meta Knight fan?
857538	858259	Maybe when the game comes out.
858279	860961	There's a lot of people now, but I don't know who the fucking King Dedede is.
861001	864784	All that reminds me of is fucking Carlos Mencia.
864804	865925	You know what?
865965	867767	TigerClaw has a really good point in our chatroom.
867787	871150	Chat.OrangeLandsRadio.com Keep in mind the creator of Smash Bros.
871190	872631	Brawl also created Kirby.
873432	874873	So, damn good point.
876855	879297	Well, he's also created... You need to have Lolo and Lala.
879797	880157	I wish.
880177	880778	That would be awesome.
881018	885682	He's also created this, which for the Nintendo Wii is something a little bit unheard of, which is getting people very excited.
886141	888781	and, of course, there's another Target Smash mode yet again.
888801	890842	You know, we see this often in the Smash Bros.
890882	891082	game.
891842	903104	There's going to be a new Target Smash mode in the game, but what's very cool about it is that you can actually send your replays through Target Smash mode to other people on your Wii console friends list.
903124	904464	They even show pictures of it happening.
904784	909205	So a lot of us are like, oh my gosh, we don't see a whole lot of this Wii Connect 24 thing going on right now.
909245	914846	Like, you have that one random Elebits thing and a couple other, but you don't see a whole lot of this, like, send game stuff
915236	915896	Two Friends.
916357	919178	So, very cool that this looks like it's going to be happening.
919578	922700	A real quick quote from the article, quote, this time you can view replays.
923080	927703	What this means is the game records what you did in Brawls or in Target Smash and lets you review it.
928263	929924	And you can record up to three minutes of data.
929964	934707	So not just in the Target mode, it looks like you can actually do this in the actual Brawls.
935327	936047	That's going to be fun.
936928	939229	Now the next thing is we need to be able to post them to the internet.
940137	941418	Download them there, kind of like Halo 3.
942099	945622	Imagine some of the brawl matches we'd see on the site ready to download.
945642	946443	That might be kind of fun.
947084	947384	We'll see.
947584	952268	Well, I'll tell you what is very happy for me is a zombie game on the DS.
952829	953630	I love zombies.
953890	954951	Zombies are pretty awesome.
955512	964300	Ignition is releasing a game called Teenage Zombies Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies, which is the best name ever.
964611	965652	I was a teenage zombie.
966572	969434	No, Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies.
970895	981042	And it's basically the world is taken over by aliens called, or alien or something called the Big Brain and the Army of Brain Thingies.
981523	983584	And so these zombies rise from their grave.
984725	986166	Rise from your grave.
986226	989608	They're immune to the Brain Thingy Ray and start eating people.
991210	991810	That's great.
991850	993151	What exactly do you do in the game?
994073	998577	It has a bunch of stylus minigames and boss battles and puzzles.
998637	1001680	Yay, minigames and puzzles, just what the DS needed.
1002001	1005524	But it's zombies, and it's supposed to play out sort of comic book style.
1006685	1007546	Well, that might be kind of cool.
1008687	1011209	But it has the word thingy in it, and that's great.
1011530	1013692	Maybe instead of Mario Party, we need Zombie Party.
1014212	1014873	That might be kind of fun.
1014913	1015934	Or Zombie Mario Party.
1016194	1017195	We need Romero Party.
1018675	1025138	You know, I'm going to stop you right there with the whole zombie teenager thing.
1025738	1028399	Ignition, what games have they put out?
1029519	1030580	Yeah, that's what I thought.
1031140	1033561	What, you mean they can't judge a game based on its title alone?
1033581	1034541	What does this world come to?
1035162	1038443	Yeah, remember that other game, Monster Madness, how awesome that was?
1038663	1041704	Oh wait, I'm sorry, it was not awesome, it was crap.
1041904	1044986	We had zombies, you know what, we need a remake of Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
1045106	1048247	I knew somehow we could not get through a zombie stories without that game coming up.
1048835	1049656	It was great.
1049896	1053678	That's what Monster Madness was sort of trying to be, but it sure as hell was not.
1054058	1055139	It failed with a PH.
1057040	1060062	Anyways, so moving on.
1060322	1061303	Some interesting stuff.
1061603	1069328	Of course, not a huge surprise, but, you know, there's going to be yet another Castlevania game on the DS.
1069868	1070688	Woo!
1070928	1072269	Big surprise there.
1073770	1076172	So, of course, producer Koji...
1077170	1080292	Igarashi said, the first thing we're doing is another DS version.
1080792	1085475	There hasn't been an official announcement, but we're doing it.
1085495	1087356	That would be the official announcement.
1087376	1089418	That was in an interview with Game Life.
1092460	1096142	They're going to be doing a new DS version.
1098644	1099504	More Castlevania?
1100845	1101465	Or what do they call that?
1101525	1101946	Metroidvania?
1101966	1102286	Metroidvania.
1103513	1104073	Metroidvania
1133422	1135384	But, you know, it might be interesting.
1136625	1138847	Can you imagine Castlevania and the Metroid Prime 3 engine?
1139167	1139788	Could be interesting.
1140388	1143110	That would be fairly cool.
1143130	1144131	I don't know yet.
1144271	1144812	It's iffy.
1145592	1146934	Obviously, it's a very iffy thing.
1147774	1148535	It's a very iffy thing.
1148973	1154036	Well, last segment we were talking about Spore, and of course a lot of folks are very excited about Spore and Will Wright.
1154056	1154897	You know, he's the man.
1155197	1157199	But Will Wright made a pretty bold statement this week.
1157299	1160661	He said that the Wii is the only next-gen console.
1161381	1166745	He said in an interview, quote, Somebody asked me what I thought next-generation meant, and what about the PlayStation 3 was next-generation.
1167105	1169106	The only next-gen system I've seen is the Wii.
1169447	1176611	The PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 feel like better versions of the last, but pretty much the same game with incremental improvement.
1176651	1178713	That was in an interview with Guardian Unlimited.
1179453	1206413	uh goes on to say quote not that the graphics are more powerful but that it hits a completely different demographic in regards to how the Wii feels like a major jump so coming from one of the you know a major you know gaming mind pretty bold statement there and just kind of goes yeah it's kind of interesting because a lot of people call Wii and you know Nintendo themselves call this the new generation like the Wii's going off over here in this direction whereas Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are kind of doing a little bit more of the same but prettier
1207421	1216950	Shut up, you people don't know anything.
1216970	1218091	That's what I have to say about that.
1218891	1220353	Make your damn games and be quiet.
1222194	1223396	This is next generation.
1223616	1225518	Listen, they're all fucking new consoles.
1225538	1226819	They're all next generation.
1226979	1227940	Shut the hell up.
1228882	1238091	If I made a new 16-bit console, that would still be another generation console because it has come out in this generation of consoles.
1238131	1238631	You know what?
1238791	1239812	There is no next-gen.
1239832	1240633	There's only current.
1241273	1242855	Next-gen is stuff that doesn't exist yet.
1244276	1246518	I just like that you just told Will Wright to shut up.
1248220	1249842	7th Generation of Consoles
1266104	1274371	No, Wikipedia puts the Atari 2600 in the second generation of games with, I believe, like Coleco and some of the ones before it in the first generation.
1274491	1279055	So then the first generation would then be like the Odyssey and the Fairchild Channel 11?
1279135	1279895	Oh boy, here we go.
1279935	1280736	Hold on, here we go.
1281016	1282437	I will pull up the article right now.
1282497	1285700	Well, no, I just think that this whole classification is pretty retarded.
1286340	1290624	I'm just tired of people commenting on what systems they think are next-gen and which systems are not.
1290664	1293146	They're all fucking... whatever.
1293706	1294307	It doesn't matter.
1294927	1295568	Your comment makes...
1296666	1301191	So you don't own a PS3, so you don't use your 360, I don't care.
1301591	1302452	Make your damn game.
1302512	1303392	Stop chit-chatting.
1303793	1305034	More workie on Spore.
1309038	1309538	You know what?
1309778	1310359	It doesn't matter.
1311220	1312681	I'm actually bringing this up right now.
1314102	1317325	They split this out into the different generations here.
1318366	1321609	Let's see if I can grab the wrap-up here real quick.
1325390	1326331	with the generations.
1326551	1327611	Let's talk more rock.
1328452	1328752	Sorry.
1329432	1341580	Okay, yeah, the first generation of games would be from 72 to 77 and includes the Magnavox Odyssey, Pong, and the Coleco Telstar are the games in the first generation.
1341960	1344802	Then the second generation moves on to...
1346004	1365591	The Fairchild Channel F, RCA Studio 2, Atari 2600, Valley Astrocade, The Odyssey, The APF Imagination Machine, The Intellivision, The Atari 5200, Milton Bradley Vectrex, The Immersion Arcadia 2001, ColecoVision, and the Sega SG-1000 are all considered in the second generation.
1365611	1366992	The Fairchild Channel F was ass.
1369476	1378104	And then the video game crash of 1983 separates to the third generation, which is the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Sega Master System, and the Atari 7800.
1378544	1382348	Then we get into the fourth generation of console games.
1385110	1394979	And the fourth generation of console games includes TurboGrafx-16, the Sega Genesis, the Neo Geo, and the Super Nintendo.
1397430	1401151	Speculate!
1401492	1402792	Well, hey, how about some other stuff?
1403152	1403452	Sure!
1404033	1405553	Poppin' Music B-Mouse!
1406614	1409174	The new Poppin' Music to be coming out.
1410875	1414737	It's themed after computer mice, so it's B-Mouse.
1415157	1416537	Well, it's a computer mouse.
1417938	1419818	Wait, and it is an actual mouse?
1419958	1421279	Yes, it is an actual mouse.
1422958	1423658	Take a look at the picture.
1423678	1424098	It's awesome.
1424138	1427759	It basically folds open and there's buttons underneath it.
1429760	1430300	That's bizarre.
1430320	1431520	You really need to check it out.
1433060	1439962	You can open up the mouse for nine buttons and play a pop-up music simulator with a CD.
1441342	1442042	That's interesting.
1442582	1443462	It's very interesting.
1444383	1445643	They've got the list of songs.
1447243	1448483	They have a really cool picture of it.
1448543	1449684	It's on Konami Style.
1450504	1451484	Definitely worth checking out.
1452796	1453557	Anything worth noting?
1454438	1455599	On the song list, I mean.
1456399	1457500	There's actually some pretty cool stuff.
1457520	1462405	There's Mr. T, Gradius Full Speed is on there.
1462885	1466308	Daikinkai by Desiro Gumi.
1467609	1470092	Another Lament theme song.
1470996	1491761	Shizuku Bayasaki, we have Megane Rock, Pop Music Wan, Gira Gira Megane Dan, Showa Kayo, Ringo, I can't see the text, it's so small, Hachimitsu, Anettai Majisuka, Orchestra Featuring Maki, yeah, that's what it says.
1492762	1493302	Lots of stuff.
1493342	1495663	There's Shining by Ryo and Noria.
1496963	1497383	And I think
1497893	1499833	And I think this actually is a mouse.
1500013	1501914	You can actually use it on your computer.
1502294	1508255	But if you take a look at this wonderful picture here, Rob, this is what it looks like.
1508315	1510035	Oh, good, because I was actually bringing it up right now.
1510215	1511656	Oh, that is weird.
1512956	1513196	Huh.
1513416	1514356	It's kind of cool, though, I guess.
1514636	1514836	Yeah.
1515336	1520817	So gaming, it's a mouse, and then when you're, you know, ready to game, you can do it.
1521958	1522998	That's pretty cool.
1523358	1524098	That's totally...
1525754	1528214	I'm putting the link in the chat room so they can see what it looks like.
1528234	1530695	I think the 2DX mouse.
1532015	1533235	2DX mouse would not work.
1533776	1536416	Especially for, you know, people like me who are right side players.
1536836	1537696	But you could do it though.
1537736	1542377	I mean, if you think about it, you could have like a scroll wheel on the side of the mouse that would be the scratch.
1543938	1544138	Yeah.
1544398	1545078	That's kind of weird.
1545098	1548878	Well, you know what they did for the... Or hell, just play 2DX with this.
1548999	1549799	For the WonderSwan?
1550079	1551259	For Beat Mania on WonderSwan?
1551929	1559412	They had an add-on to it that you could attach a scratch pad onto the controller.
1559632	1561153	We should get 2DXDS.
1562534	1563214	That would work.
1564254	1565075	I think that that would work.
1565095	1567816	I stand by what I said in Part A about what they really need to do to innovate.
1568756	1572098	Anyways, so other fun stuff, of course.
1573363	1577045	There's more firmware coming out now for the PlayStation 3.
1577765	1586469	If you happen to purchase a copy of Ratchet & Clank Future, Tools of Destruction, you got version 1.94, which didn't really do much.
1586529	1591871	I think it added some support for the DualShock 3 for that game, and then maybe some other shit.
1591971	1601156	But that doesn't matter, because apparently firmware 2.0 is supposed to be released on October 30th, and will feature some wonderful stuff, including...
1602913	1609919	The ability to turn on and off your PS3 using the PSP Remote Play.
1611080	1612581	I don't see the purpose of that.
1614022	1616164	A new PlayStation Network category.
1616544	1624530	A TV category for those of you who are in Europe who are installing the Play TV onto your hard drive.
1625371	1627673	A new playlist for music and photo.
1628293	1631496	A content group for video and game.
1632112	1652868	and apparently there's the cross media bar customization including themes and background color settings sort of like what they have with the PSP right now and then the Trend Micro Web Security for PS3 Internet Browser which is a parental lock for website viewing that will be free for a while and then eventually they'll charge you for it.
1655009	1659753	Well Ratchet and Clank also has something else very interesting in it not just a surprise upgrade
1660529	1661330	in anticipation of 2.0.
1662290	1669995	But Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction apparently will actually tie up to the upcoming PSP game Secret Agent Clank.
1670415	1675278	And this was from a one-up interview with Insomniac's creative director, Brian Alagier.
1676079	1686425	And apparently he says that the PS3 game and the new PSP game will actually work and connect to each other in, quote, some secret, undisclosed way.
1687065	1687886	And that's all we know.
1688842	1692145	Do you unlock some old Ratchet & Clank game with it?
1692165	1693706	Like a Metroid hookup type thing?
1694127	1695007	Unfortunately, we don't know.
1695668	1698630	But we do know that the game will not connect up with other services.
1699511	1704235	Tools of Destruction will not connect to Home or any other PlayStation game or PSP game.
1704315	1707157	Just the other Ratchet & Clank game that is coming out.
1707198	1708098	Secret Agent Clank.
1709019	1709800	So, look for it.
1711321	1713042	I'd be curious to know what that connectivity is.
1713102	1715745	I hope it's something new and exciting.
1715785	1717386	Not something we've kind of seen before.
1718740	1727138	Well, for anyone who is playing Motorstorm, there is a, looks like a patch to the game.
1728180	1728401	Mm-hmm.
1729870	1735853	that will actually add vibration support for the DualShock 3 controller.
1737473	1741475	Grid order randomized for the first race in any online lobby.
1742055	1748558	Finishing positions for your last race to determine your starting grid position in the next race within the same online lobby.
1749518	1754380	Screen indicators added to show whether voice comms are issuing from TV or headset.
1756481	1758762	Sensitivity for 6-axis motion sensor
1760080	1762205	Gloating Index, that's kind of weird.
1763528	1768540	It gives you an idea of how well another racer has performed.
1771347	1774409	I do like how it seems like quite a few Sony games are doing this.
1774429	1777652	I like how these games kind of keep patching themselves to get a little better.
1778372	1780354	I think that's kind of cool.
1780414	1784117	It feels like I'm seeing that happen more on the Sony games than on 360 games.
1784197	1789681	Usually the 360 games get patched to fix something that broke, not often to add completely new stuff.
1790161	1796846	And that makes it feel a little more like, well, let's say World of Warcraft constantly patches itself, and a lot of MMOs do this, patch itself with brand new stuff.
1797486	1798447	So it's kind of interesting.
1799540	1800081	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1820925	1823346	Yeah, it kind of sucked when everybody was hitting it at once.
1823446	1825546	But World of Warcraft does it kind of smart now.
1825967	1834729	Right before a major patch will come out, a couple days or maybe even a week before, they'll actually put a thing similar to BitTorrent that will automatically run when you launch WoW.
1834769	1837270	So it slowly downloads the patch as you're playing.
1837690	1843652	And so that way when it's time for the patch to go live, then it'll send a pulse that says, okay, time to update the game with the patch.
1843712	1845053	And so everybody already has it downloaded.
1845733	1846253	It's kind of cool.
1846753	1847393	That's pretty smart.
1848234	1849274	I like the way they do it on WoW.
1849830	1854872	And I want 2.3 already, because I want my Arena Season 1 gear without having to work for it.
1855212	1861235	Although I still kind of like how they do it in Ragnarok, where they do small patches every time.
1862836	1865997	And so it makes sure that your patches are all up to date right when you start the game.
1867358	1873260	That's kind of how Guild Wars worked too, wasn't it?
1874100	1875981	I think so, it's just little bits at a time.
1876702	1877482	Yeah, cool.
1879611	1883373	Anyways, let's see here.
1885054	1886075	Interesting news.
1886295	1894180	Well, I wouldn't exactly call this news because I've been talking about how stupid easy it's going to be to copy the damn cards for Eye of Judgment.
1894200	1896321	But apparently it's even easier than you may have thought.
1897562	1901504	The game has absolutely no copy protection whatsoever.
1901904	1908228	In fact, you can pretty much draw symbols on a piece of paper using a felt tip marker and it will work.
1910353	1911513	That's really sad.
1912093	1914454	But yeah, it's very easy to copy them.
1916075	1927198	The game has no problem reading, you know, printed out copies of the cards, or just if you happen to scribble in the symbols that they have on the cards, it will work as well.
1927338	1930679	So basically with a box of Crayolas, I could recreate the cards.
1930859	1931059	Yes.
1931719	1931939	Wow.
1931979	1932519	Yes, you could.
1933400	1934180	That's kind of sad.
1935480	1935920	It is sad.
1936801	1937301	You know what?
1937441	1937941	I don't...
1939318	1941800	I'm just curious what the chat room has to say for this.
1942901	1945242	And I will remind... I'm having live stream problems.
1945362	1947824	Dark Tetsuya is giving a big XD to Crayola.
1948224	1957131	I will remind you, though, that in case you don't want to copy the cards, the theme packs are available for $15 each or $4 per booster pack.
1958491	1960613	I swear I didn't use a crayon reference on purpose.
1960693	1961073	I swear.
1961133	1961914	Oh my god.
1961934	1962935	That's funny.
1963475	1964075	Anyhow, what's that?
1964436	1965877	Oh, the fake cards?
1966097	1966257	Yeah.
1967190	1972411	Anyhow, you know, this means we got lied to about the whole copy protection thing, and I don't like getting lied to.
1973211	1977192	We all knew this was coming, we all knew this was going to happen, and this makes us very angsty.
1977893	1980253	So you know we have to bring on the FUs of the week.
1980773	1982954	And back by popular demand, folks.
1993637	1995497	FU to this music, I'm fucking sick of it.
1998237	1999338	Sorry, we got emails.
1999418	1999998	They missed it.
2000318	2000898	Don't care.
2001218	2001758	Don't care.
2001958	2002499	Don't care.
2003619	2004059	We'll see.
2005839	2009300	F you the women for not being able to make up their mind on certain things.
2009700	2016062	For example, say you're asking your wife what they want to eat for dinner.
2016542	2017622	And they're like, I don't know.
2017742	2018942	So you start suggesting things.
2018982	2020203	And they're like, no, I don't want to do that.
2020383	2021043	No, I don't want to do that.
2021815	2028239	We'll fucking suggest something then if you're just going to deny every one of my suggestions and fucking come up with your own.
2028459	2028900	I hate it.
2029080	2030121	It's not about everything.
2030181	2032442	Women do this about all sorts of categories.
2033523	2034524	I'm going to give you a hint.
2035624	2036625	Just do whatever you want.
2037766	2039387	I do, and they complain.
2039827	2043029	So, there's no winning that argument.
2045731	2045931	That's it.
2047892	2051575	Alright, my FU of the week goes to my injury.
2052759	2053460	Because it sucks.
2054340	2057443	And I don't like having a sore thigh thing.
2057483	2058724	It makes it hard to sit down.
2058924	2060785	People go, ha ha ha, you can't sit down.
2061986	2062747	Being injured sucks.
2063828	2065369	I had a real FU, actually.
2066009	2066650	Oh, yes, what is that?
2066950	2069732	Stupid music pushed it out of my head.
2070753	2072695	I don't even know if I have the other music queued up.
2072755	2073255	Hold on.
2073976	2079320	Let's see if we can do... Shuffling, shuffling, shuffling.
2080114	2082176	This is Wonderful Radio as I dig through the computer.
2082196	2082936	Don't worry about it.
2082956	2083637	Hold on, hold on.
2083657	2084538	Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
2084938	2085699	I'm in the right folder.
2086159	2087100	I just need the right file name.
2088261	2089942	And here we go.
2091904	2092685	Much better.
2092745	2092905	Anyway.
2097188	2097489	Anyway.
2106868	2108088	My actual F.U.
2108869	2113152	goes towards... I don't really want to say towards my husband.
2113872	2118515	Because I really, really, really do love my husband.
2119696	2122537	But he can be freaking infuriating sometimes.
2123518	2127421	And I know that he has good intentions.
2128601	2132023	But don't try to...
2134944	2141089	Don't try to have a logical discussion with me when I haven't eaten anything in like 12 hours.
2141570	2142130	It doesn't work.
2143251	2144973	And don't be pushy about it either.
2145934	2146334	The end.
2150698	2151058	Alright.
2151939	2154621	Sorry, I was putting away the webcam because our Op 11 time ran up.
2155101	2156303	Why are people pushy?
2157443	2157784	I don't know.
2159425	2161287	You shouldn't be pushy, you should be pully.
2163174	2169659	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news, because then we'll be pushing the listeners to call in on our Skype line.
2169679	2172121	1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lingerie.
2172141	2174543	We have a few more stories, a handful of stories for you guys before we get there.
2175264	2177265	And the first one has to do with GameStop.
2177746	2183490	You know, GameStop, they have EB, and it seems like they're taking over the world when it comes to mall video game stores.
2183510	2185992	And they just might be, because they just opened up.
2186573	2188174	This place isn't that far from us, actually.
2188214	2189315	Jackson, California.
2189355	2190376	That's not that far from here.
2190456	2191817	Just probably...
2192649	2197191	They opened up their 5,000th store, GameStop did.
2197231	2199332	The 5,000th GameStop store.
2199352	2199993	What GameStop?
2200633	2206336	Well, to put that in perspective, and a lot of people feel that way, which is why this news may be good news for some and bad news for others.
2206656	2214700	To put it in perspective, Starbucks has 12,000 plus locations, but I wonder if that counts like the ones in the grocery store.
2214720	2215000	I don't know.
2215376	2218858	and McDonald's, get this, has 31,000 restaurants.
2219258	2225482	But still, to think that for every six McDonald's there's one GameStop, I mean, there's a lot of frickin' McDonald's, right?
2225522	2227523	Like, every exit on the freeway has a McDonald's, right?
2228023	2231265	So, kind of interesting that for every six of those there's still one GameStop.
2232385	2232745	Interesting.
2234666	2235967	Very interesting.
2237468	2242291	Well, you know what else is interesting is that people are still making Dreamcast games.
2243491	2244592	And the rest of the world goes, why?
2245489	2246209	Dreamcast was so awesome.
2276784	2280467	Anyways, it's a little bit of fun here.
2281347	2289293	Well, I don't know if this is fun, but the place where the internet goes to die is now going to be the place where games go to die.
2289353	2293235	Because MySpace is launching their Casual Games channel in 2008.
2294576	2300560	And you'll be able to put crappy Flash games into your webpage.
2301007	2304168	So I can destroy my profile with all those buildings.
2304188	2305348	Some people do that already.
2305768	2307489	I think people on MySpace have seen it.
2307829	2310209	Some coworker of mine has Pac-Man on their profile.
2310629	2312030	Like a little mini Pac-Man game.
2312630	2313610	It's not real Pac-Man.
2313670	2315931	It's some cheap knockoff, but oh boy.
2317211	2323793	Could that be interesting though if they had leaderboards all tied together and you could see how you compare on these casual games to your friends?
2323833	2325233	I mean, a little silly fun.
2325899	2326440	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2341095	2343256	I had somebody make mine.
2343516	2344716	But mine was pretty.
2344896	2347377	You still had the final approval and you looked at it and you go, yeah.
2347657	2350198	I helped design the graphics on it too.
2350538	2354179	I look at some of my friends' MySpaces and I go, do you even look at your own page?
2354699	2355720	It's hideous.
2355840	2358100	You have to scroll down forever to see anything.
2358561	2359621	Who's actually going to look at this?
2361081	2363762	I actually scaled my MySpace page back a little while ago.
2363942	2371624	A, so I can make it public, and B, because it's public again, and B, so I could just not have to scroll so much because of all the stupid pictures I had on it.
2374244	2378565	Black Lab in our chatroom says, MySpace is garbage, but don't you have a MySpace?
2380246	2382606	GS68 says, you do not say the MS word.
2382706	2383247	Microsoft?
2384667	2385147	Oh, MySpace.
2385926	2386806	Someone left a comment.
2386847	2389548	I was just checking my MySpace now to see what was on it.
2390328	2392069	And Neki left the best joke ever.
2392369	2392689	What's that?
2392909	2395910	Where do mentally ill people go that's bigger on the inside than the out?
2395950	2396951	And it's their retardus.
2396971	2399352	That's awful.
2399872	2400732	Oh, a tardus.
2400852	2401273	I get it.
2401573	2402013	Wow.
2403053	2404054	Bad Doctor Who joke.
2404074	2406034	That is a very bad joke in many different forms.
2406095	2406975	But it made me laugh.
2406995	2407255	All right.
2408027	2410808	Anyhow, maybe our listeners want to tell some jokes tonight.
2411689	2413290	We're going to take some calls right now.

2426476	2428337	Our username is OrangeloungeRadio.
2430438	2433759	Looking at some other quick comments on chat while we wait for some calls because of the delay.
2434200	2437021	Escapist in our chatroom says, In regards to Facebook...
2437745	2440606	Here we go again with the MySpace versus Facebook thing.
2441187	2443668	Just try to lick me in real life, I dare you.
2445769	2449871	I'm sure that's from one of those, you just got a lick, or you just got poked by so-and-so.
2451191	2452972	I don't want to go back to my annoyance with Facebook.
2453012	2459175	I actually tried to, I went back and added some friends, because some OLR people added me on Facebook.
2459195	2463677	I guess amongst all my rants on the show recently, folks figured out I had an account, so.
2465007	2468550	Alright, let's head on over to the phones and we'll take a call.
2469410	2470431	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2470451	2470751	Who's this?
2471872	2473053	That's Legend of Zaku.
2473313	2474414	Hello, Legend of Zaku.
2474454	2474995	What's on your mind?
2476055	2478757	Nah, just going through the usual Sunday 15.
2480499	2484261	Just, you know, getting prices and stuff like that.
2485182	2485542	Demo.
2486163	2486943	Listening to our show.
2487204	2488445	Are you doing both at the same time?
2489345	2492227	Well, if I could, now that I have a new PC to do it on.
2492608	2492868	Nice.
2493576	2494216	So what's on your mind?
2494256	2495697	What do you want to tell us about?
2497097	2497677	I don't know.
2497757	2503819	The fact that Crysis is just, you know, it's not for the faint of heart, graphics-wise and, you know, system-wise.
2504879	2508820	Obviously, you're going to need a really beefy PC to get through it.
2510760	2511620	But is it a good game?
2512941	2513141	Huh?
2513421	2514141	Is it a good game?
2515081	2515801	So far, it is.
2515882	2520763	I mean, it's kind of like Half-Life and Far... Half-Life 2 and Far Cry had a love child.
2521303	2521583	Okay.
2522739	2530102	Alright, I mean, yeah, so far it's running pretty good for a new system that I built so far.
2531783	2537585	But, you know, hopefully when it launches it'll probably be optimized and ready for use.
2538306	2543428	It was a little laggy from what I hear from other folks with other more powerful systems than mine.
2544608	2546289	Alright, very cool.
2546549	2548690	Well, anything else you've been playing lately besides Crysis?
2549951	2550371	Um, just...
2551038	2553739	Quake Wars, another game that came with my video card.
2554900	2556181	Enemy Territory, Quake Wars.
2556321	2556801	And how's that?
2557601	2561863	It's alright, I mean, it's kind of like Battlefield in the Quake Wars world.
2562544	2563364	I mean, the Quake world.
2564705	2572809	Quake, you know, Quake needs, you know, because Quake 4 wasn't all that great, so Quake needs some good games that make me remember how much the first game was awesome.
2572829	2575470	We need Duke, Enemy Territory, Duke Nukem.
2576371	2577131	That's what we need.
2577271	2578772	Maybe after Duke Nukem Forever.
2579252	2580773	Wasn't that supposed to come out at the end of the year?
2581728	2582449	Oh, fucking hell.
2582469	2586211	Wasn't one of those, hey, it finally got a release date, and it's like... No, it never got a release date.
2586231	2587712	That'd be all over the internet, man.
2587752	2588552	Yes, that's true.
2589653	2608265	And also, I think I heard of another Xbox Live horror story where this one guy, he sent his console to get it repaired, and then when he got the new one back, he couldn't even transfer $320 worth of Microsoft points.
2611152	2612212	because they're not transferable.
2613033	2613253	Right.
2614033	2615494	Can't you call Microsoft and get that fixed?
2616154	2620536	No, that's apparently, unfortunately, that's a policy that they have.
2620816	2621717	Well, here's the thing.
2621737	2626719	You don't need to transfer the points because your live account is on their server.
2627039	2627699	It's not on the 360.
2627819	2634322	All you've got to do is re... What they told him was that the points were actually tied to the console.
2635191	2635731	No, they're not.
2636572	2638393	From what I recall, it's a little bit of both.
2638713	2641295	You download the game, and that's tied to your account, but here's the thing.
2641515	2648780	Let's say me and you, let's say we're roommates again, Loki, back in the day, and we have one 360 in the house.
2649240	2653083	If I paid for the game and I downloaded it, you get to play the full version on the console.
2653623	2654324	But here's the thing.
2654884	2660628	If we get a new console or whatever, and I sign in and download the game, you can't play it.
2660968	2662349	You still get the trial version.
2663459	2666220	Okay, that's still, that doesn't matter, that's the thing.
2666981	2679027	Is that his games that he purchased should be able to be transferred over because he can just re-download them again and he still has the full rights to them because it has, you know, on record that he's paid for it.
2679500	2685323	and also if he has any Microsoft points because you can purchase those points through like independent websites and stuff and add them on there.
2685343	2691046	Like for example, if you're buying stuff for your Zoom, your Microsoft account or whatever, still tied to all that stuff.
2691086	2693327	So you can port it over even if you buy a new 360.
2693367	2697009	They have the ability to do that.
2697069	2697549	I've done that.
2697569	2698749	I don't know the story right now.
2699890	2700670	I don't know where.
2700690	2703352	I know I saw it on... Well, that's the story and you stick into it.
2704332	2704552	All right.
2704852	2706653	Well, Zach, we got to let you go to get some more calls.
2706713	2707974	Real quick, last final thought for everybody.
2709177	2717563	Um, just, I don't know, just, you know, just get a better computer.
2717983	2719204	Somebody might need one.
2719544	2720925	Everybody, get a better computer.
2721326	2722226	Alright, thanks, Saku.
2722246	2722887	Have a good one, buddy.
2723427	2723767	Alright, good.
2723787	2724127	Bye-bye.
2725208	2725949	Did you hear that, everybody?
2725969	2726929	You need to get a better computer.
2727249	2728350	Loki, get a better computer.
2728550	2729611	DarkSakura, get a better computer.
2729631	2730272	I do need a better computer.
2730292	2731432	No, I need a computer.
2732373	2734855	My computer, the hard drive, or something's crapping out on it.
2734915	2735355	I actually want to...
2735782	2736202	Shutting off.
2736222	2739345	This fucking fan on this thing is so... I wonder if I could, like, hold the microphone.
2739385	2739906	You could hear it.
2742328	2744109	The fan on this thing is so loud.
2744129	2745350	You can hear it throughout the whole house.
2745410	2746151	It's crazy.
2746671	2747772	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2747792	2748132	Who's this?
2752236	2753117	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2753137	2753477	Who's this?
2754758	2756399	This would be the Dark Knight himself.
2756520	2757420	There you are, sir.
2757440	2758781	You're a little bit quiet, but that's all right.
2758841	2759742	We'll fix that.
2760022	2760603	How you doing?
2760823	2761584	How you doing, Dark Knight?
2763746	2764206	Yeah, how you doing?
2765202	2765682	Good, how are you?
2767723	2770464	Um, a little bit happier now that I have my 360.
2771384	2774225	I actually, I noticed that you've actually been signing into live.
2774265	2780666	I was playing Guitar Hero 3 earlier today, and I saw you sign on, and I was kind of like, wait a minute, I thought he only had an Xbox.com account, but not a live.
2780987	2782447	So now you're actually on Xbox Live.
2784207	2784568	And all that.
2785668	2787348	Yeah.
2788029	2789269	So what kind of games have you been playing?
2790809	2792670	Um, Forza 2 and, um,
2793689	2796170	Man of 97, Man of 07, I'm sorry.
2796870	2799931	But yeah, if you were playing Man of 97 on Xbox, that would be something though.
2799951	2803092	That means you had to crash the cartridge into some slot.
2803152	2805873	Xbox Live Arcade or something like that.
2805893	2806313	Very cool.
2806613	2811095	So, what's it like being all brand new to the Xbox now?
2811195	2813976	I mean, does it seem like there's like a lot out there the Xbox has to offer?
2814176	2816077	I guess let me back up and rephrase it this way.
2816377	2819638	What made you finally decide to take the plunge after all this time and jump in and get a 360?
2821639	2822539	Part of it because I
2823089	2824009	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2852728	2854610	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2873183	2873443	You know what?
2873483	2877547	Not everybody can just afford to run out and go buy an HD TV.
2877587	2879348	They're still kind of pricey.
2879848	2888175	Do you think, amongst your gaming experience, does Microsoft do a pretty good job of still keeping the love for the folks that are stuck with standard definition for now?
2889676	2892258	Yeah, I mean, it's not really that bad at all.
2892279	2897162	Like I said, I'm playing Mando 7, and it looks just as good on HD.
2897182	2900125	The only difference is I don't have that total clearness, and I...
2900908	2903770	HD would have them, but it does do it justice.
2904251	2906312	Do most of the standard definitions of games letterbox?
2907473	2908053	Do you get the bars?
2909915	2913677	No, because basically it picks up as a 480p TV.
2914438	2915078	Oh, interesting.
2916539	2918301	Some games letterbox themselves though, right?
2918321	2921403	Didn't Final Fantasy XI automatically letterbox even if you were on a standard TV?
2921983	2923384	Well, it depends on the game.
2923444	2929829	I mean, because you have to set your console to just, you can set it so that your TV is a 4x3 aspect ratio and then
2930325	2934449	If the game wants to letterbox it will, otherwise it may just do full screen.
2937551	2939974	Yeah.
2940194	2940694	Interesting.
2940814	2941235	Like I said.
2943797	2948701	Well, Dark Knight, what would you say you're looking forward to most on the 360 now that you're an owner?
2951464	2952945	Just messing around with it right now.
2953586	2954426	Just getting used to it.
2954446	2956909	I mean, so far I downloaded some, like...
2957660	2965264	Xbox Live games and whatnot, like I downloaded Final Fantasy Special and whatnot.
2965405	2966445	I can't get my words out tonight.
2966565	2967005	Very cool.
2967045	2967566	No, that's all right.
2967966	2972088	So, wow, if you think about it, they're almost up to like 100 of those games pretty soon.
2972168	2980733	So being a new, I mean, for those of us who have been on Xbox Live a while, it seems like, all right, you know, we just kind of wait for each week to see what they're going to release and see if it's worth buying.
2980773	2983515	But, man, to be jumping in on that now and then you dip into the archive, like,
2984031	2987593	Well, Dark Knight, we have to let you go so we can get to some more calls.
2987993	2989274	Thank you very much, and enjoy the Xbox.
2989294	2990575	And I hope your Xbox experience is Red Rings of Death free.
2990595	2992976	Well, lo and behold, my system is like a link to it.
3009671	3013053	I think it was dated July 22nd of 07, so it's recent.
3013293	3013613	Oh, good.
3014114	3014314	Good.
3014374	3015594	Then I hope it's red rings free.
3016075	3016315	All right.
3016335	3017756	We'll be pulling for you, buddy.
3018836	3019196	All right.
3019236	3019697	You have a good one.
3019877	3020117	See you.
3020137	3020417	You too.
3021378	3021538	Bye.
3021658	3021958	Bye-bye.
3022978	3028702	If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
3029062	3031423	Let's see if we can squeeze in some – oh, we're already getting a call.
3031463	3031803	Here we go.
3033044	3034025	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3034045	3034425	Who's this?
3035285	3036306	Yo, it's Xenacore.
3036326	3036906	How y'all doing?
3037026	3037286	Good.
3037346	3038167	How are you, Xenacore?
3039008	3040308	Yeah, I'm living, I'm living.
3040348	3041269	You know how things go.
3041509	3042349	Yeah, exactly.
3042429	3042809	So are we.
3043209	3047791	Even with minor injuries and whatever else is going on in our personal lives, we're making it to another week.
3048151	3048671	What's on your mind?
3050892	3051472	Not too much.
3051813	3055874	I just heard you guys referencing some of the old school stuff and thought I'd call in.
3057435	3059655	DarkSakura was talking about Ragnarok 2.
3060055	3064357	I touched something that looks like it was made in the same engine called, was it
3064946	3066788	Pirate King Online
3077459	3080380	I got that feeling, but I'm going to farm that off on the show.
3080420	3081300	I couldn't review it.
3082341	3084822	Xenocore, what is a weird echoing with you?
3084902	3085722	I don't know what that is.
3086002	3092304	I just want to let those people who are listening on their iPods and stuff know, if you're hearing him repeat things, that's not you guys.
3092384	3094505	It's something weird with the call.
3094785	3095805	Actually, it is you guys.
3095845	3097726	You just can't hear correctly.
3098406	3099086	I don't know what that is.
3099146	3100307	That's an error I've not seen before.
3100547	3102868	But anyway, so Pirate King was okay.
3103008	3104668	Ragnarok was a ton more fun.
3104928	3105729	Okay, all right.
3106609	3106789	Yeah.
3108483	3117990	that one and all different odds and ends here and there managed to get some more points on ER Kung Fu and Xbox Live but that's pretty much the only noteworthy thing I've been doing lately so
3118813	3120995	Hey, Yara Kung Fu is a pretty fun little game.
3121055	3122476	It's often overlooked.
3123437	3126719	But, you know, because fighting games have evolved so damn much since then.
3127139	3128580	But, you know, you've got to respect the elders, too.
3128981	3130322	I know you play a lot of RPGs.
3130502	3135465	What other kind of obscure MMOs, because everybody always talks about Warcraft, Warcraft, Warcraft.
3135846	3142951	What other types of MMOs and just maybe other role-playing games in general should we be looking out for that maybe the mainstream media doesn't pay enough attention to?
3143956	3145199	Bounty Bay Online Bounty Bay Online
3152535	3153535	It's a pirate simulator.
3153595	3157896	It plays like pirates does, but it's an MMO environment, so it was pretty neat.
3158616	3162057	Wow, we really do have a lot of pirates MMOs, because then Disney put out an official one.
3162097	3169539	I'm thinking, well, of course, there's puzzle pirates too, and it's kind of all probably thanks to Johnny Depp, but I don't know.
3169779	3171340	You'd like to think probably he has something to do with that.
3171540	3173400	But where are my ninja MMOs?
3173480	3174560	That's the ultimate question.
3174580	3175901	We have all these pirate MMOs.
3176261	3180102	Where is my ninja MMO, whether it be Ninja Gaiden or Last Ninja?
3180162	3181142	I don't know, just a ninja MMO.
3182452	3183292	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
3183332	3184253	Damn Skippy, man.
3185353	3186954	We need to take our idea and patent it.
3187234	3187534	There it is.
3188334	3190775	I now own the patents and trademarks on the Ninja MMO.
3191235	3192036	Watch me get sued.
3192456	3193396	Somebody probably made one.
3193416	3194056	I just don't know of it.
3197758	3198978	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3200319	3201239	That's pretty much it.
3201779	3204540	I'm still waiting for Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 to come out.
3204560	3206081	We'll see how they do upon release.
3206221	3206921	Guitar Hero 3 was out yesterday.
3209784	3210864	Oh yeah, that's true, that's true.
3210944	3215905	But Rock Band's the one I'm looking for, but I'm waiting for the peripherals to start coming by themselves.
3215945	3218146	I don't have that many homies around me to buy the whole set.
3218226	3220526	Exactly, that's too much money for the whole set.
3220626	3223827	And unfortunately, the peripherals by themselves are going to be going into 08.
3224507	3228588	But I'm probably going to pick up the game because I have the Guitar Hero 2 controller, which will work with Rock Band.
3228888	3234629	So at least I'll have guitar, and if my microphone works for Xbox Live, then I'll have a microphone.
3234669	3236410	If it doesn't, then it doesn't.
3236470	3237990	Nobody on Xbox Live needs to hear me sing anyway.
3238010	3238390	I'm buying it.
3238871	3239611	I don't need to hear me sing.
3239851	3240151	I'm buying.
3240171	3241191	You're going to buy the whole bundle?
3241372	3241712	Yeah.
3241832	3242312	Sucker.
3242772	3246453	I know, because I hate playing guitar here, and I don't know why the fuck I keep buying this shit.
3246673	3247393	I'm getting the bundle.
3247673	3248973	Because I can.
3248993	3249773	You guys are made of money.
3250413	3250693	All right.
3250813	3251354	I'm not made of money.
3251374	3254474	The bundle's worth it if you're going to get anything, everything, anyway.
3254554	3254794	It is.
3254834	3255214	It's okay.
3255314	3256615	If you're not going to, then you better.
3256655	3256835	Okay, Rob.
3256875	3261876	I've cut down on my buying of 360 games, so I don't have to really worry about, you know, I'm saving up.
3262436	3262736	All right.
3262996	3264056	I'm not your mommy.
3264096	3264536	You can buy.
3264556	3265997	You can spend your money however you want.
3266037	3266477	I'm just saying.
3266517	3266477	$170.
3266537	3267657	That's a lot of money.
3267677	3267997	I know.
3269126	3279774	Not really, because I mean, if I don't, you know, go out for lunch during my work week, then after, you know, a few weeks, that's enough to pay for the game.
3280755	3282616	Then again, next month is going to be slim for me anyway.
3283757	3284097	Alright.
3284938	3289321	Well, Xenocor, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but any other quick last comments?
3290382	3291642	Yeah, that's pretty much it, guys.
3291683	3292563	I'll talk to you guys later.
3292643	3293584	Alright, take care, Xenocor.
3294224	3294585	Bye-bye.
3294785	3295085	Bye-bye.
3295578	3297580	I think this is the first time he's been on the program, actually.
3297640	3299541	I don't remember him calling in before.
3300121	3300942	Maybe he did once.
3301582	3304264	But appreciate always hearing from the people we don't often hear from.
3304585	3309368	But we also appreciate hearing from the people we do often hear from, which I believe is our next call.
3309428	3310649	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3311610	3312370	Hey, it's Ranma.
3312390	3313051	What's up, everyone?
3313131	3313892	What'd I tell you?
3313932	3314912	Hi, everyone.
3315413	3316173	Ranma, how you doing?
3316313	3316934	Hey.
3317935	3323539	No, I just said because the last caller was someone we don't hear from a lot, but now we're hearing from someone we do hear from a lot, but that's all right.
3323599	3323899	What's up?
3324966	3325866	Not much, not much.
3326046	3328027	Oh, and Sky, I know you're pro-Ninja.
3328047	3332369	I'm going to try to send you a Ninjas vs. Pirates shirt where Ninjas win 4-3.
3332589	3333109	All right.
3333790	3334290	Sounds good.
3334310	3335410	Yes, definitely.
3335690	3337111	But I don't hate Pirates.
3337151	3341273	Like, usually, you know, in the Ninja vs. Pirate war, you have to love one and hate the others.
3341593	3342413	I don't hate Pirates.
3342513	3343694	I respect Pirates.
3344574	3347075	But they're just, you know, they're just inferior to Ninjas.
3348115	3349016	Plus, Ninjas are cooler.
3349276	3349676	That's right.
3350436	3350536	Yeah.
3350996	3351937	Anyway, sorry.
3351957	3353397	What did you want to call us to talk about tonight?
3353437	3354698	Surely it wasn't Pirates vs. Ninjas.
3355524	3357245	Oh no, I got a couple of game reviews for you.
3357425	3358185	Woohoo, what games?
3359346	3362708	Puzzle Quest for the DS and The Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass.
3362768	3365149	Alright, let's start with Puzzle Quest for the DS because it's the older game.
3365169	3365569	What do you think?
3367390	3370191	Honestly, I should have waited until the game dropped in 1999.
3370812	3372312	Oh snap, not a big fan, huh?
3373153	3378215	Yeah, I am a big fan of Bejeweled and a friend of mine bought it and I really didn't know too much about it.
3378255	3379856	She said, it's just like Bejeweled.
3379916	3381077	I'm like, really?
3381697	3383458	Went out like a couple of weeks later and I bought it.
3384116	3392778	I like the puzzle aspect, the puzzle RPG element of it, but it's just that when you're looking at the game, it's like you're not sure where to begin.
3392798	3394259	Do you want to build up your gold?
3394599	3397339	Do you want to start fighting the creature, build up your experience?
3398060	3407522	And you just got to be very careful in the patterns that you move because you make the wrong move, your opponent's going to hit like a 5-6 chain combo, then you're like really screwed.
3408502	3409002	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3433846	3436168	I don't know, my wife's not having trouble beating the game.
3436248	3437670	Well, your wife has a super brain or something.
3437690	3440272	No, I don't know, it's just a different way of thinking about it.
3440412	3441593	I've got a few words for you, Loki, okay?
3459173	3462675	There's a lot of people I know that have beat the game, but it's a different way of thinking about it.
3462715	3465196	You can't play it like you're playing Bejeweled, because you'll be screwed.
3466596	3467576	It's all about the skulls.
3467857	3475559	You have to look at the screen and make sure there's no skulls that you can line up first, because if you don't get it, I swear to God, the computer will every time.
3475579	3478420	They're ruthless, but that's a challenge.
3479601	3481322	I love unlocking stuff in the game.
3481402	3487644	I mean, if I could just sit there and do those puzzles all day, it just kills my entire time on the train going to work.
3488890	3491352	So maybe this game's worth a little more than giving it credit for.
3491732	3492892	So what don't you like about the game?
3494233	3496254	One thing that really gets on me is the music.
3496314	3502597	I mean, yes, it's supposed to be a medieval style, but the music can be so low that I find myself almost passing out and going to sleep.
3503217	3503717	I'll give you that.
3503757	3505158	The music's a little generic in the game.
3505198	3506018	It's nothing too special.
3507519	3510140	All right, well, tell us a little more about the other game you're going to review.
3510180	3510980	Is it Phantom Hourglass?
3511661	3512301	Phantom Hourglass.
3512681	3513662	It is so good.
3514102	3514382	Is it?
3515444	3521929	Yes, I mean, I'm playing it, I'm like, this is so much like a Link to the Past to me, the way they have it set up.
3522409	3524051	This is what it reminds me so much of.
3524651	3534078	Honestly, I didn't even know you controlled Link with the stylus, I bought the game, and I'm like, I don't know if I'm going to like this, but ten minutes in, I'm like, okay, I could definitely rock this.
3534799	3536060	This is it, this is fun.
3537020	3537481	Interesting.
3537601	3541584	I see, I'm still not sure how I feel about it, but I'm going to try and borrow it from my friend.
3542940	3547922	I'm starting to get poor from all these games I'm buying, so I definitely want to try and borrow it from somewhere, but that's kind of cool.
3549422	3552783	So, I mean, how does it compare to other handheld Zelda games?
3552863	3560366	I mean, does the whole stylus element just really change things for the better, for the worse, or just the new gen, or whatever you want to call it?
3561386	3563427	I think it makes things for the better, though.
3563787	3572090	I mean, because the last bunch of portable Zelda games, what do we have, like Oracle of Ages, Oracle of Seasons, A Link to the Past, the port of that, you know?
3574111	3575251	None of those were bad games.
3576092	3576232	Yeah.
3576772	3580453	But they were just kind of the Super Nintendo games in handheld form.
3580853	3581514	Yeah, definitely.
3581774	3582654	Could you hold up one second?
3582674	3583074	Hold on.
3583694	3584655	Did we just get put on hold?
3585015	3585695	No, no, no.
3586395	3590537	My roommate's playing Guitar Hero 3, and I think he's on the very last song.
3590997	3591677	Oh, my gosh.
3592637	3593078	Yeah.
3593298	3593838	How funny.
3594758	3595158	Oh, yeah.
3595458	3596339	That's pretty hardcore.
3596359	3598099	You've got to be playing that game a lot to get that far.
3598419	3600340	All right, Ranma, any other quick thoughts?
3600360	3600940	We've got to let you go.
3601280	3602821	Try to take one more call before we sign off.
3603817	3608681	About Loki's tingle costume, teal green or bright green?
3609682	3610983	Are you going to make him a costume?
3611744	3614986	I know people that will do it.
3615407	3616648	Don't put the cart before the horse.
3616688	3618489	The game has to sell a million copies first.
3618509	3619951	I ain't going to sell a million copies.
3620151	3623333	That's okay because I can get the fabric for cheap either way.
3623393	3624675	It's a win-win situation.
3624755	3627917	I'm pretty sure it's a darker green, very similar to what Link wears.
3628238	3631120	But when the game sells you a million copies, we'll send you Loki's measurements.
3631989	3633931	is not going to sell a million copies.
3634191	3634572	It's totally not.
3634592	3638335	That would be extremely, extremely unlikely.
3638355	3640857	But you have to admit, what a hilarious Christmas gift that would be.
3641838	3642939	The ultimate gag gift.
3643180	3645502	Well, it wouldn't be Christmas since it's six months from now.
3646763	3650246	Alright, Ranma, we've got to let you go, but thanks so much for calling in, alright?
3650887	3651347	Take care.
3652828	3655671	It would be a fun six-year anniversary gift.
3656272	3656732	For the show.
3657032	3657713	Yeah, because that
3659553	3665156	DarkSakura and I might have to go to Hancock Fabrics or whatever fabric stores are out there and go get some fabric.
3665176	3665956	Let's go to LA.
3666496	3668397	Or just go to New York and meet up with Ranma's friends.
3668877	3670338	I think this is going to be the last call tonight, folks.
3670798	3671778	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3671798	3672119	Who's this?
3673599	3674199	It's Puppy.
3674720	3676140	Puppy!
3676741	3677241	What's on your mind?
3677281	3678421	Why aren't you in studio tonight?
3678621	3679702	We have a fourth mic now.
3681162	3681743	Oh, you do?
3681783	3684944	Well, I have a guitar here with me and that's what I've been busy with today.
3685364	3686264	Fair enough, fair enough.
3686304	3686965	Well, how was the game?
3686985	3687625	How are you enjoying it?
3689208	3689989	I like it a lot.
3690149	3702379	I'm a little bit teed off at the amount of selling out that Activision did with the game because by the time I got to the third set of songs, I had already seen like four new companies advertising in the game.
3703640	3704301	Really?
3704421	3706062	How did they advertise the companies in the game?
3706082	3707203	Because maybe I'm just oblivious.
3707243	3708084	I totally missed it.
3709245	3713148	Well, other than the Guitar Center stuff from the store... That I did notice.
3713228	3713689	I've seen...
3716670	3719393	I saw there was Axe doing some stuff.
3719413	3727641	They have Axe guitar patterns and these Axe girls that come out and dance during some of the encore stages.
3727741	3728162	Wow.
3728202	3739473	And then Pontiac came out and there's one whole stage where it's just like the Pontiac garage like from Jimmy Kimmel Live or whatever it is because it's supposed to be some sort of fancy music video set.
3739733	3740514	Interesting.
3740814	3743596	and a Pontiac car comes and runs you over.
3743616	3744496	That's hilarious.
3744536	3752041	But at the same time, I look at this and go, okay, would I rather we have the Pontiac stage of Guitar Hero or the Yaris game?
3752061	3758365	You know, here's one thing that they forgot to mention about Guitar Hero that's really fucking awesome.
3758525	3761667	The intro and the fucking cut scenes that are in this game.
3762047	3762808	Yeah, the cartoons.
3763208	3764209	They're awesome.
3764229	3767871	Why don't they just do a Guitar Hero cartoon series?
3767891	3769712	That'd be fucking cooler than the game.
3773035	3776677	Loki feels very strongly about his dislike of Guitar Hero over here.
3777057	3778738	Well, hey, they've already done that before.
3778838	3787323	It was called Legend of Black Heaven, and it was an anime thing about this middle-aged guy who becomes a rocker again and fights aliens, and it's awesome.
3787343	3790825	The cartoons, the cutscenes made me think of, what the hell's Metalocalypse?
3790985	3792166	What's that show on Cartoon Network?
3792486	3794047	It's Metalocalypse.
3794087	3794528	Thank you.
3794908	3796989	That's what the cartoon things made me think of.
3797569	3799771	I don't watch that show a whole lot, but anyway, I'm sorry, Bubby.
3799791	3800611	That would be funny.
3801191	3802172	That would be funny enough.
3802617	3807160	Yeah, so what did you, we made you talk about Guitar Hero, what did you actually want to call in and talk about tonight?
3808801	3829595	Well, other than Guitar Hero, yeah, that's what I've been spending most of my time on, but I just was wondering also, you know, you were mentioning earlier about the Halo 3 downloading videos and game views and stuff like that, and I was wondering if you had actually seen a bunch of the stuff that had been coming out recently with all the
3830410	3836032	All the funny little clips of people getting killed by cones and shooting themselves in the head with sniper rifles.
3836392	3839193	No, but you need to send me some of the best ones, and I will.
3839253	3842374	Simply because I've been playing so many other games since Halo.
3842394	3847536	Because now we're getting into that gaming barrage where it seems like every week I'm playing a new game I want to play.
3847596	3849476	And then next year I'm going to go back and catch up on everything.
3849816	3852077	So at some point I will have to go get that.
3852117	3855058	But I love taking the pictures and putting them online.
3855458	3857019	I mean, forget looking at other people's stuff.
3857039	3858379	I like playing with my own stuff.
3858679	3860140	Stuff that I create is fun.
3860440	3862782	But to be honest, I haven't touched Halo 3 in about a week at least.
3862962	3866405	So I need to look up some of this funny stuff.
3866605	3868566	So please send me some funny ones.
3868746	3872469	A bunch of this stuff is actually on YouTube, some of the more popular stuff.
3872569	3875391	And it's all free advertising for Halo 3.
3876512	3877353	All free advertising.
3878694	3879494	Oh yeah, definitely.
3879654	3880355	Bungie's loving it.
3880720	3883281	Well, in all honesty, all that money probably went to the celebrities that they had in the game.
3883301	3883981	I mean, they got Slash and...
3907267	3911368	Tom Morello, and I think a lot of original versions of songs too.
3912088	3919789	Yeah, and like the lead singer from Poison, I forgot what his name was, Brett Michaels, he did all the motion capture for the singers in the game.
3921990	3926590	Did you, what did you think of the new version of Anarchy in the UK?
3926610	3929811	I haven't gotten that one.
3929831	3932971	I never had heard that song before, so I honestly don't know.
3933311	3936032	It's the first time I think the Sex Pistols have been together since the 70s.
3937361	3938342	to record anything.
3938902	3942644	I saw that that was an unlockable video that you could get, so I might have to check that out.
3943004	3947707	I remember the old song, and I know the bad, bad guitar freaks cover, but I'm curious about what this is.
3947747	3950068	Man, they must have been hard up for money then.
3951549	3952009	You never know.
3952629	3956491	All right, well, Puppy, we've got to let you go because we're going to go wrap up the show, but thanks so much for calling, all right?
3957492	3957812	All right.
3957972	3959933	All right, and come back to the show in the future.
3960113	3960914	You don't live that far away.
3960954	3961254	I will.
3961474	3962074	All right, you better.
3962094	3962715	I'll try to.
3963135	3963635	All right, take care.
3963655	3965036	Thank you.
3965056	3965116	Bye.
3965652	3971335	Escapist in our chatroom says, Brett Michaels should have paid to be in Guitar Hero 3 instead of being paid.
3972115	3972855	I kind of agree.
3973036	3974596	It's great exposure for these folks.
3975097	3980619	And in some extent, I mean, I don't know, God, maybe I'll say something controversial here, but some of these people are kind of washed up.
3981039	3984981	Like Brett Michaels, I mean, well, he has that show on VH1, but, you know.
3985141	3987022	Yeah, that doesn't make him washed up at all.
3987042	3987603	I guess that's true.
3987683	3988523	He's on VH1.
3988823	3991384	That's usually a sign of being a washed up celebrity.
3992065	3992605	True, true.
3993562	4000645	And you know, I don't know, Slash is a great guitarist, but the mainstream doesn't talk about Slash, but now they might.
4001086	4003827	So you're right, these guys maybe ought to be paying them to be in the game.
4004267	4004607	Who knows?
4005888	4010670	Anyhow, we've been going at this a long time, so I think it's finally time to wrap this up and call it a night.
4011070	4014212	So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4014232	4015792	Actually, we didn't get last minute stories.
4015812	4016573	Did we have more last minute stories?
4016593	4017573	We didn't get any last minute stories.
4017593	4019234	I'm sorry, then let's get last minute stories real quick.
4019534	4021675	Anyways, so a few things.
4022230	4028516	First off, let's see, GameStop's dropped their Xbox 360 product replacement plans.
4029437	4031719	So apparently now they're no longer fixing those.
4032620	4035523	I guess Microsoft will have to do more of that.
4035703	4036423	Let's see here.
4037545	4039847	GripShift has been rated for the Xbox 360.
4040187	4042389	If you might remember, that was a crappy-ass game.
4042850	4046173	They came out on the PlayStation Network and also on the PSP.
4046857	4047597	I highly recommend it.
4047617	4050638	If it does come out on Live Arcade, do not fucking buy it.
4050798	4053599	It's horrible, horrible, horrible.
4053959	4058801	That crappy Xbox Live Arcade game stick is now 50% cheaper in the UK.
4059341	4060622	Still shouldn't buy it, though.
4061722	4068644	There is a wonderful application made by Microsoft, I guess, employee Adam Keener, or Kenny?
4069305	4069625	Keeney?
4069805	4070085	I don't know.
4070583	4073124	XBOX Live Friend Tracker TV Program Schedule Channel
4098456	4109705	I don't know about you but I'm pretty sure on most cable networks especially if it's satellite or digital cable there's a guide button on your remote to see what's on TV.
4109745	4112287	Do we really need this on here?
4112307	4115890	People are speculating, oh it's going to lead to an IPTV channel.
4115930	4118532	Yeah, where the fuck are you going to store that shit on the Wii?
4118972	4119853	That's what I'd like to know.
4122075	4127539	If you're ordering Super Mario Galaxy you ain't getting your pre-order coin until the fucking game comes out.
4128052	4131034	Not that you really should order the game because of that coin.
4131334	4136096	Also, might remind you that that game is going to be fucking hard to find around the holidays.
4136176	4138898	So if you haven't pre-ordered it yet, it's time to do it.
4138998	4143781	Because it's going to be like the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess where it's near impossible to find.
4144641	4146302	And then finally, Gran Turismo 5.
4147463	4149904	They've had some of the features announced for it.
4150224	4155147	Including there's going to be an online garage course, online head-to-head racing, time trials.
4155886	4176202	Track of the Day, B-Spec Race, License Test, Drift Contest, Tuning and Setting Features, Friends List, Lobby, Voice Chat, Bulletin Board, Spectator Mode, Team Building, Club Building, Color and other editors and looks like some other fun stuff.
4176482	4177703	So photo albums also.
4178224	4182327	Lots of wonderful features for a game that's not going to come out until Christmas of next year.
4183127	4183708	If that.
4185120	4196830	Oh, and by the way, there's also something fun in the little Sears ad that was on gonintendo.com, and I tell you, this also tickles me rose and gold as well.
4198872	4199152	Nice.
4199533	4212384	In other words, it also, they basically have the two DS Lite bundles, one with Triforces on it, one with a paw print, the one with the Triforces gold comes with Zelda, the one with the paw print comes with a special edition of Nintendogs.
4213396	4213916	DarkSakura
4243627	4246569	I'm sorry that I forgot to bring you the lotion I was going to bring you.
4246769	4247810	But I can give it to you tomorrow.
4248211	4248431	Sure.
4248771	4249692	Or if you want to come by.
4249972	4253635	I don't know about tomorrow because tomorrow is the boyfriend's birthday.
4254015	4259219	So we're pretty busy, but maybe... Go look for anything with Arnica in it.
4259639	4259879	Okay.
4260300	4264583	This is my natural remedies session.
4264903	4266164	Now I need something for my toothache.
4266705	4267345	Clove oil.
4267465	4269687	I really don't want to go to the dentist because I hate going to the dentist.
4269707	4269927	Clove oil.
4269947	4270848	I'm a used car salesman.
4271008	4271228	All right.
4271857	4272277	Clove oil.
4272858	4273818	Not on the gum, but on the tooth.
4274199	4274579	On the tooth.
4275840	4277781	That's what they used to use in dentist's office back in the day.
4278041	4278301	Wow.
4279122	4292011	But, yeah, I'm going to be very strict for the next three weeks until Thanksgiving because when I go to Alabama, I am going to eat fried chicken and grits and fried chicken liver.
4292651	4293412	Don't talk about food.
4293452	4294092	That sounds yummy.
4294152	4295073	Fried chicken sounds good right now.
4295093	4295993	I love fried chicken liver.
4296374	4298315	With country gravy, I'm going to have fried catfish.
4299187	4300448	and I'm not going to do anything.
4300488	4302328	It's a vacation from everything.
4303369	4304749	And Sauce is coming with me.
4305690	4308491	And all we're going to do is sit and watch movies and eat.
4308991	4309531	Sounds like fun.
4309771	4310512	Sounds beautiful.
4310832	4315694	But I have to be extra, you know, constant vigilance for the next three weeks.
4315914	4320836	Speaking of food, I just want to say this real quick since we love to talk about, like when we're not talking about games, we're talking about food, right?
4320896	4321096	Yeah.
4321436	4322737	I had dim summer today.
4322797	4323357	Oh, I love dim summer.
4323517	4324417	Oh, so good.
4324537	4328239	Because like we went to one of those like authentic Chinese places that have like the duck feet and everything.
4328744	4330185	or not duck feet, chicken feet.
4330965	4335608	I didn't have any of that because I just don't like chicken feet, but there was some real good food today.
4336268	4339970	That shrimp wrapped up in pasta was so good.
4340330	4341991	The actual spring rolls.
4342991	4343772	Well, they had those too.
4344352	4346553	I'm going to go to In-N-Out.
4346573	4349895	I'm going to have a chocolate strawberry shake and animal style fries for dinner.
4349915	4350495	There you go.
4351115	4351536	Good stuff.
4351776	4352916	Tomorrow I'm having vegetables.
4353457	4354277	Loki, sorry.
4354637	4355257	All the food talk.
4355277	4356118	Your final thought, Loki.
4356278	4358179	I have a lot of games to play this week and not a lot of time.
4361553	4362033	Well said.
4363214	4364615	And that's going to bring our show to a close.
4364655	4365756	We're done tonight, folks.
