13940	26848	Tonight, October 14th, 2007, Nintendo unveils holiday news that includes a dreaded delay, Elder Scrolls Oblivion gets one last hurrah, and we're joined by members of Bizarre Creations to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxy.
32386	34107	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
34207	36948	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36988	42151	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42211	47974	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
51021	58668	If we sound a little dead, it's because this is now our third time trying to record the show, and Jamie has been... Wait, wait a minute.
58848	60750	This was empty a minute ago, and now it's full again.
61330	65454	This is Mountain Dew Gamer Fuel that Chris brought for DarkSakura.
65494	66335	It's like cocaine.
66795	67436	What's it taste like?
67796	75343	The taste is sort of like orange cream soda, but the first taste of it is sort of like very orangey fruit punch, and the aftertaste of it is cream soda.
75931	76392	Interesting.
76672	78333	I think that's fairly accurate, wouldn't you say?
78594	79975	It tastes like butt.
80115	80555	No, I don't know.
81056	82137	I didn't like it so much.
83178	83498	Kind of.
84439	87722	Also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
90685	93688	Hello, since this mic cord does not reach.
94389	94909	No, it's fine.
95570	96651	You can just speak into two microphones.
97451	98933	No, I don't need to speak into two microphones.
100200	103583	Okay, the problem we're having tonight, folks, is that we're down to two microphones.
103623	109027	The microphone that Loki usually uses died while we were trying to tape live here on this lovely Sunday evening.
109087	111149	So Loki's mic is gone.
111569	116673	So now we're having to share between the five people who are in studio tonight, two microphones.
116874	124019	So we apologize if there's any audio delays or audio slowing or other audio issues, but this is what happens when you do live radio, folks.
124660	126902	When things break, you don't have much time to fix it.
127342	128883	So Loki's over there.
128963	129684	So yes, DarkSakura.
130365	131446	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
153203	154164	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
182802	184163	My name is Black Lab.
184343	185224	What is your quest?
187505	188406	Ultimate power.
188966	191088	What is the airspeed velocity of a swallow?
191108	192048	No, forget it.
193789	195210	God, you guys are crazy.
196411	199513	It's what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
201074	202415	Is it African or European swallow?
202836	203316	I don't know that.
205878	206238	Wow.
208319	208980	Anyhow, let's...
210123	212764	Also say hello to a very special guest.
212844	213404	I was surprised.
213444	214664	I didn't even know she was coming tonight.
215064	216104	It's Chris, everybody.
216765	218705	Surprise, butt sex!
219585	220366	All right.
220386	220606	Wow.
220626	220906	Sorry.
221366	225087	I got to keep my voice down because it's the acoustics in this room.
225147	225767	That's all right.
225907	226747	Kind of interesting.
227087	230068	And Chris is one of the official lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.
230668	237810	And I'm actually surprised to see her back because I was thinking you were going to be flying to Wisconsin soon, right?
237990	238690	Oh, well, I...
239651	242512	I went to GeekCon last week, but that was only for a week.
242612	245974	And in March, I am officially moving to Wisconsin for my school career.
246454	247315	Jamie's helping me.
247335	248455	No, no, no, no, no.
248655	249316	I am leaving.
250076	252237	I am going in the U-Haul with Chris, and I'm leaving.
253177	254198	She's coming back.
254638	255138	I am not.
255238	255719	Shut up.
256259	256779	I'm kidding.
257279	259420	I was trying to be funny.
259440	260121	Oh, okay.
260261	260621	I'm sorry.
260641	261381	I failed at it.
262302	262842	I failed.
263022	263582	Fail!
264002	265163	You're not doing it right.
265183	266103	You're not doing it right.
267204	269125	So I'm trying to hang out with you guys as much as possible, so...
269844	270284	Ragnarokan
292170	293470	It was lots of Ragnarok.
294531	300632	I deleted a character and restart one, and I got two of them past job 50, and I played a lot.
300872	303993	And I looked at your copy of Every Extend Extra and couldn't find the PSP.
305314	305634	Wow.
305814	307174	You accomplished a lot.
307294	308995	And I bought a game, and I gave it to you.
309615	309815	Yes.
310315	310915	Fantasy Zone.
310935	313356	And then I don't have an old-school Nintendo to play it on, but I will do one.
313376	313916	But I have three.
314676	314856	Sweet.
314876	315676	And I will lend you one.
315837	316237	Yay.
316717	317577	Maybe our top loader.
318356	319356	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
347836	348296	So Halo.
348917	349417	Lots of Halo.
349557	350238	Halo and WoW.
350578	351719	What's your kill ratio in Halo?
353220	354561	Like, more than one.
354822	355362	That's good.
355642	357684	Mine is less than .75.
357784	358384	That's bad.
359225	359786	That's bad.
360246	360846	I think I'm like 1.6.
361547	364329	Oh wow, that's pretty good.
364589	364830	I know.
365690	366771	I'm not that good though.
367492	368733	I still suck on occasion.
369954	373176	Alright, well let's move on and Chris, how was your gaming week?
374157	374477	Wow.
375138	375438	It was fun.
376539	382103	Megzi finally caved in thanks to peer pressure to get World of Warcraft.
382944	389388	And she bought me an account for a month, so I've been kind of trying to use that up as much as possible to try to make it worth my while.
389528	395772	And so I've been playing a lot of that and dying a lot, which is always a favorite pastime.
396664	400546	Well, honey, Mac... I'm working... So, Virtual PC.
400927	406690	Virtual PC doesn't like... I don't have... Well, it works on Mac, I just don't have that much room.
406730	408451	I think that Ragnarok would run on a 486.
408531	411513	Because it was probably created on one.
412274	415756	I like my dancing blood elves.
416436	416937	That's okay.
417457	418437	Dancing blood elves are fun.
418938	419918	And good for you being Horde.
419938	421119	For the Horde!
421399	422220	For the Alliance!
423160	423721	Diedrani.
423761	424121	Boo Alliance.
424680	425380	Draenei are okay.
425620	426281	I can do Draenei.
426481	427881	Because they speak like Russians.
427921	430022	That's kind of cool.
430322	433183	Loki, how was your gaming week?
434064	434464	It was good.
435484	438966	I played Halo 3.
439046	441126	I've gotten a little bit further in Legendary.
441147	444308	Now I'm on the fifth chapter or whatever.
444748	445348	Five out of ten.
445528	446188	Halfway through the game.
446729	447489	So it's doing pretty good.
447789	452611	I just have no idea how the hell I'm going to finish the last part of the game because that's where the difficulty really ramped up.
454236	457338	and then, let's see, of course, more Saints Row multiplayer.
457578	466781	That's fun now because we've been playing in the Ultradome and we've been trying to jump cars to the top tier and actually been quite successful at that.
466821	472324	So now it's who can get to the top tier the quickest and then try to survive without getting hit by rockets.
473244	473744	That's fun.
474524	482968	And then, let's see, I've also been playing Half-Life 2 The Orange Box, mainly Portal on that, and that's...
484790	487411	I was hoping someone on the show called Orange Lounge Radio
514983	517285	I don't know, just kind of playing through that a little bit.
517525	526313	Then watching my wife play Puzzle Quest on the 360, which is just like Puzzle Quest on everything else.
526593	528996	And then I played the Yaris game.
531238	533079	God, what the fuck?
534481	535321	I don't even know.
536022	538244	It's free, but I feel like I'm being ripped off.
538504	540326	It's, you know, seriously...
542259	547161	Just because it's... I understand why it's free, because there's no way anyone would pay for that shit.
548662	552704	I just... It reminded me of, like, was it Sonic the Hedgehog 2?
553144	554425	Like, the bonus stages and that?
554865	556926	Except really crappy and made no sense.
557246	558947	And it was just stupid.
559847	560568	It was horrible.
561728	563089	I tried playing that, too.
563149	566190	I downloaded it and played, like, about ten minutes of it and got confused.
566270	571453	Because it's like, your car has, like, a tentacle that shoots lasers, and you have to shoot...
572572	577593	Like flying box birds and toasters or something like that.
578674	581034	You said the best thing ever.
581514	583295	Tentacles that shoot lasers.
584955	585696	No, I know.
585776	587676	You would think this would be the perfect game, right?
587956	590837	A car with a tentacle that shoots laser beams at things.
591337	592357	How fucking rad is that?
592597	595638	Yet somehow this game manages to fuck it up for free!
597239	601620	By the way, I will not be buying a Yaris because of this game.
602446	603606	I'm just telling you that much.
604507	607187	If I had thought about that... See, this is the thing now.
607227	610888	Every time someone thinks about Yaris, they're going to think, man, that sucked.
611409	612429	So, thank you.
612569	615090	You have now associated suck with Yaris.
615610	616570	I thought they did that already.
618051	619591	They've just driven that home now.
621752	622072	Alright.
622972	626193	So, thumbs down on the Yaris game.
627133	628153	It's not worth free.
630871	633272	It definitely is not worth free.
633372	634492	I still want a priest.
634512	635753	I want my time back.
638434	638734	All right.
639394	640114	My Gaming Week.
640634	643515	Folks, today was a good day.
643635	644836	You know why today was a good day?
646176	649077	I now have a level 70 druid in Warcraft.
650678	651978	I dinged 70 today.
652198	652958	Hold on, everybody.
653039	653779	I want my grats.
653879	654259	Here we go.
654739	655259	Ding.
655279	656940	Ding.
657080	657900	Wait, where's my grats?
658140	658560	Ding.
658680	659121	Grats.
659341	659861	There you go.
659941	660281	Thank you.
661496	662577	God, you guys need training.
662937	663237	All right.
664358	665739	And you all call yourselves WoW players.
666279	667280	I'm not a WoW player.
667380	668200	Fuck that shit.
669601	670342	These two are.
671623	677287	I was forced into exile from my dead PC and my butthead husband who won't build me a new one.
677787	678387	So you know what?
678467	681910	I'm taking matters into my own hands, and I'm playing Guild Wars.
683210	683571	Grats.
685512	685792	All right.
685812	688214	I'm level 20.
688674	689315	Hey, that's not bad.
689635	690896	20 is partway to 70.
690936	691276	All right, anyway.
692118	692279	So...
694924	702211	So I did that, hooray, I'm officially an addict, and then I also played Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live with the tiniest text ever.
702831	721808	You can definitely tell this game is a port from another system, namely the DS, and I don't know, for me, the mechanics of the game work a little well on the DS, but it is kind of fun to be able to play the game like humongous, the game itself, not the text, on the TV, just kind of kick back, you know, play on the TV, and it does have the Xbox Live element, which is kind of cool, but...
723223	724304	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
738906	740407	Use the stylus to swap the bricks.
740467	741348	It works a lot easier.
742088	743990	But otherwise, Puzzle Quest itself is a great game.
744030	749013	I mean, it took Bejeweled and made it like 100 times better by adding this whole competitive element to it.
749073	750494	So I was very happy with that.
750534	755017	But one thing to the Xbox Live's credit, it costs about half as much as the DS version.
755037	760721	And for an arcade title, for an Xbox Live arcade title, especially considering it came out the same week as Yaris...
761580	764221	It's definitely one of the better things you can download on Xbox Live Arcade.
764241	768843	So if you don't have a DS and you like puzzlers at all, I definitely recommend you check out Puzzle Quest.
768863	776106	But if you have a DS, maybe it's worth it to pay the extra 10, 15 bucks so you can have the game on the go and have the better controls.
776646	778167	So that's Puzzle Quest in a nutshell.
778387	782029	And then I also played the Yaris game and I was like, WTF, LOL, BBQ.
784110	784930	What else did you play, Chris?
785464	786527	I play Dungeons and Dragons.
787068	787388	Nerd.
787749	788531	I am a nerd.
788912	790135	And I converted nerds.
790295	791417	I attack the darkness.
793943	794823	No, no, no.
794963	802008	I went to GeekCon in Madison, Wisconsin last week, and they had a Dungeons & Dragons table in the RPG room.
802728	807951	And it was set for beginners, and I'm an experienced player, so I just wanted to go in there for the gameplay and maybe help out.
808271	816476	The guy looked at me, brought in my three core books, my 75 characters, and he looked so intimidated at me.
816496	818237	He's like, oh, you play.
819558	819939	I'm like, yeah.
820079	820419	Yeah.
821593	822594	Let's play Let's rock it
839339	842161	D&D is kind of the roots of video gaming in a way.
842281	843341	I mean, modern RPGs.
843782	851146	Yeah, Meg Z's friends, I'm teaching them how to play, and they all have played all the RPGs, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft, so they're really good at it.
851166	853408	But you're still a hardcore nerd for being into that.
853708	854869	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
855049	855369	Damn.
855822	856122	All right.
856963	857863	Going to our chat room.
857883	858683	See that webcam?
858763	859684	Damn right.
859764	861285	Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
861305	862305	Got dice right here.
862485	863826	Is where our chatters always are.
863846	871689	We're going to start off tonight with NM64 says, Sky, if the text, speaking of Puzzle Quest, is a port of a DS version, how can the text be small?
871909	874591	Wouldn't it be like five times bigger along with the rest of the screen?
874831	875511	That's what you'd think.
875851	879413	But for whatever reason, they, you know, certainly they upscaled the graphics.
879433	881374	You're not going to look at, like, pixelated stuff, okay?
881714	882815	It is HD graphics.
882855	885016	The game looks very nice and has a good art style.
885256	889818	But for whatever reason, they brought in text the size of the DS resolution.
889918	890618	I have no idea.
890638	896381	I would think that it would be a port of the PSP version since it's in a similar aspect ratio.
896421	897082	Perhaps it is.
897422	897862	I don't know.
898122	900423	I haven't played the PSP version, so it's hard for me to say.
900724	901464	But that would make sense.
902347	907752	But I hope the text in the PSP version isn't that small, because then you need a monocle to read it.
907812	909454	I don't know, a magnifying glass is crazy.
909474	911035	A fucking monocle.
911055	912637	That's right, you need a fucking monocle.
913217	915599	The NDA 4.0 is going to suck.
915880	917341	I heard they're making it like Warcraft.
917761	919463	It is, and you know what the problem is?
919583	920184	It's worse.
920564	927130	Because instead of them running around and doing stuff, it's little figures that you have on the mat, and they just move.
928720	932483	Are Chinese people going to be farming for gold in D&D 4.0 as well?
933624	934004	No idea.
934665	934925	Alright.
935185	938468	Those little figurines were cool when they were on their own separate game.
938968	941670	Because they had those D&D figurines for a few years now.
942151	944332	I used to collect them for my roommates.
944793	945933	Is that like Warhammer?
946434	946934	I am a nerd.
947134	948856	Are those like Warhammer things?
949676	950237	Kind of.
951858	954580	And you used the hex charts to move them around and all that crap?
954620	955961	Well, it wasn't a hex chart.
956001	956962	It was just the squares.
956982	957022	Oh.
958462	960403	You know, you had little characters.
960503	970249	The guy who runs our game actually uses... The guy who runs the game that I'm in actually uses a hex map and little figurines.
970790	971290	Fuck that.
971410	973151	It's, you know, fuck the hex maps.
973271	977194	It's all about, if they survive the fall down the stairs, they win.
977574	981256	That is, you just flick those little things off the stairs and they fly.
982037	983378	Well, I have a suggestion.
983738	984819	How about we move off of D&D?
987592	997221	No disrespect, but we do want to move on with the show because thanks to all our audio problems that you didn't hear tonight if you weren't listening live, we're now 40 minutes into our program tonight and no news yet.
997321	999183	So really quick, some housekeeping.
999643	1006050	You can view a live webcam of our show in progress or an archived webcam of our show over operator11.com.
1006070	1009533	You can see our smiling faces all looking at you, waving hello and doing this program.

1018069	1018589	Super Smash Bros.
1018649	1019210	Brawl It's Delayed
1048444	1051325	Haha, no Smash Brothers for Christmas, Timmy.
1051805	1056086	Anyways, it's going to be coming out now in February on the 10th.
1057826	1060947	And other news, Sonic the Hedgehog's in there.
1061047	1063628	Oh my god, that's like such a surprise.
1063768	1067629	Like, who would have thought that Sonic the Hedgehog would be on a Wii game?
1068649	1069029	Really?
1069329	1070129	Who would have thought?
1070149	1078051	I mean, you know, it's not like that they have, I don't know, Mario and Sonic at the Olympics and shit like that.
1078976	1080577	Sonic is in there, it's pretty cool.
1082998	1083799	What more can I say?
1084159	1085660	Although I am not surprised.
1085920	1091203	In fact, this will be, I'm guessing, the first of many delays to come.
1091683	1102148	In fact, we had heard, straight from Nintendo, Nintendo recently announced that there will be an additional 30 days added to most fourth quarter Wii releases due to production issues.
1103249	1106751	So you'll probably see a lot of Wii titles slipping by 30 days or so.
1108115	1108477	Uh-oh.
1108517	1109581	Where is this coming from?
1110324	1111147	Nintendo?
1111689	1112312	Oh, okay.
1113032	1114112	Mega Man
1143140	1143620	Mega Man?
1144160	1144520	Anybody?
1144761	1145061	Anybody?
1145241	1145821	Anybody else think?
1145981	1146741	Who's not in there?
1147641	1148782	Or who's already in there?
1148802	1152443	Oh, okay.
1153563	1157305	If they kept on the Sega route, I would actually put Knuckles in it.
1159305	1170829	I would say to make, because now everybody's going like OMG Mario vs. Sonic, I would say to make the console wars of yesteryear complete, Bonk needs to be the third party character in the game, but we'll see.
1171937	1176540	So they're like, okay, hooray, we're going to have Sonic in the game.
1176701	1180683	Oh, and by the way, we're going to release this game next year on February 10th.
1181804	1182825	They just ran out.
1182845	1184986	Darth Vader, no, forget it.
1188641	1189301	Bad joke.
1189341	1190002	Joke gone wrong.
1190062	1196584	I was just going to say, they probably just ran out of days, you know, to tease characters, you know, in the Smash Dojo.
1196604	1198084	So they're like, fuck, we need some more time.
1198304	1199285	Let's just push the game back.
1199325	1199745	How about that?
1199865	1202106	I think I like Saikun's suggestion of Bomberman.
1202726	1211669	Because that's more... Because Bomberman was also one of the NEC, you know, Hudson main people.
1213109	1214550	Dark Tetsuya says Pyramid Head.
1214910	1216331	That would be awesome, but not going to happen.
1216371	1216771	I'm sorry.
1217251	1217331	Um...
1219204	1220365	I don't know, we'll see.
1240650	1243712	If you want to be cooler than all your friends and play Super Smash Bros.
1243732	1248196	Brawl first, you've got to go to E4ALL, which is being held in L.A.
1249016	1249677	next week.
1250577	1252319	Starting on October 18th at the L.A.
1252339	1252959	Convention Center.
1252979	1257622	Of course, this is the little band-aid because there was no real E3.
1257642	1259243	There was mini-E3 earlier this year.
1260004	1262986	So this is their throw to try and fill that void.
1263867	1265708	But of course, Sony and Microsoft are not going to be there.
1266252	1269774	However, Nintendo is, Nintendo said, we're going to be there and we're showing off all of these games.
1269794	1272396	We're showing off Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Bros.
1272456	1291168	Brawl, Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, Battalion Wars 2, Fire Emblem, Wii Zapper, Crossbow Training, Mario Song at the Olympics, Guitar Hero 3, Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, Resident Evil Umbrella, Ella, Ella, A, A, A, Chronicles, Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad, and on the DS, there's a lot of stuff.
1292108	1294430	Pokemon, Diamond and Pearl, wait, didn't that come out?
1294790	1296431	Brain Age, wait, didn't that come out?
1296471	1297992	Brain Age 2, wait, that came out too.
1299093	1301094	Zelda Phantom Hourglass, actually that came out as well.
1301114	1303075	Nintendogs, you know, that came out too.
1303155	1307237	Mario Kart, you know, a lot of these games they're showing actually have already come out, I'm noticing.
1307517	1308458	Shh, they're new.
1310879	1312660	If they're not new, they're new to you.
1312760	1317723	But hey, if you want to play them like they're new again, head on over to E4ALL.
1317763	1322346	Hey, Final Fantasy XII is going to be there, that little spin-off game on the DS, so there's some new stuff.
1323405	1325286	They may not be new, but you'll think they are.
1326106	1327367	They're going to try to fool you.
1328507	1337371	Well, what is not new, and actually this does not completely surprise me at all, is that the Wii is not lowering price at all.
1338112	1340253	It will stay at $249.
1341773	1346816	And that's because the folks at Nintendo are saying that they're selling them as they make them.
1347596	1351578	So they're having absolutely no trouble and see no point in lowering the price.
1352150	1355552	On top of that, I mean, honestly, $249 is not bad for a system.
1356892	1361794	So basically Nintendo's saying, you know, well, you guys are still buying them, so what do we need to do any different?
1361914	1363515	In fact, we're going to increase the price!
1364455	1364856	You know.
1364876	1365276	Sucka!
1365616	1366136	They could.
1366596	1370098	The direct quote, I think it's funny that this guy's name is George Harrison.
1370798	1378482	But anyway, who is one of the Nintendo reps, said that we'll stay at $249 for the foreseeable future.
1378902	1381063	We are still selling everything we can make.
1382273	1383974	So hey, you're making money.
1384054	1384915	You're still selling them.
1385175	1385675	What the hell?
1386235	1386776	I know one thing.
1386796	1389778	I thought George Harrison was leaving Nintendo and going back to being a dead beetle.
1391298	1391639	What?
1392219	1395121	I heard... No, I seriously heard he was leaving Nintendo.
1395221	1396742	So what's going on with that?
1397502	1399363	It's a bad... Okay, that's the bad joke.
1401004	1401265	Anyway.
1401585	1409670	I was going to say that this didn't make the show roll, but there was conspiracy theories going around that there...
1411543	1418466	One, that they're either lowering production so that there's still a shortage going through the holidays to increase demand on the Wii.
1420327	1427070	Or, because this is also kind of being shown in their marketing campaign, or that they're just making the best of a bad situation.
1427611	1432993	Because, if you notice, their new set of commercials now, the very first thing that starts off is all, we got one.
1433313	1434234	Like, it's a big thing.
1434374	1435294	Like, we got one.
1435914	1436555	And now, no, you know...
1437828	1442231	We stood up, we started playing, we had fun, we bonded, all this shit.
1442451	1444172	But the whole thing is like, we got one!
1444312	1445713	Oh my god, celebration!
1446293	1448494	See, that's the fucking thing, that's what they're doing.
1448534	1450996	They're trying to market off of this shortage thing.
1451236	1455298	So whether it's intentional or not, they're using it to their advantage.
1455918	1456579	And you know what?
1457259	1460681	They probably don't need to anyways, but it's probably a good marketing campaign.
1461161	1463943	Because it's just going to increase hype, and really that's all that they care about.
1465544	1465864	Although...
1467629	1473550	There is a part in there that is a little disturbing with the mother and son.
1473690	1481012	They're playing some game or something, and she's like holding his hand, and it's like, was it We Came Together?
1481352	1482072	Or something like that.
1482352	1483752	Like, oh!
1484372	1484913	No!
1484933	1488153	God, only you people could think that.
1488713	1493114	Is that the one that at the very end, the Japanese guys hand you the controller?
1493134	1495735	We would like to play!
1498593	1499253	It was really funny.
1499273	1511220	When I was in Wisconsin, Megzi's mother was entertaining some Japanese guests, and she's got a Wii, and they were looking at it, and Megzi was like, oh, yeah, it's a Wii.
1511440	1513181	And he's like, we've never seen one.
1515142	1516723	They were from Chiba, so I don't know.
1516763	1521085	We actually have the chatroom reaction to Loki's little comment on We Came Together.
1522626	1525428	We Came Together
1531639	1534541	Wow.
1534621	1536362	Way to have that clip queued up.
1536502	1538804	I didn't realize there was going to be like 15 seconds into it.
1540605	1543667	No!
1545268	1547149	That's why we don't have a soundboard on the program, folks.
1548590	1548830	Anyways.
1550951	1558696	In other news, and more to get you up on your feet, Wii Fit's coming out to Japan on December 1st for 8,800 yen.
1560362	1588500	And of course I'll feature the Wii balance board that's approximately $75 US And yeah, no idea when it's coming out in the US though So you'll have to wait your fat asses until it comes out Actually those boards supposedly only hold up to like 300 pounds So if you're like one of those people on the Maury Povich show You may not even get to play this game at all Get two boards One for each hoof Wait, no
1590055	1590976	How many yen was that?
1591897	1592258	It was 8,800.
1592338	1593439	8,800 yen.
1593519	1599805	Now if you're having difficulty imagining how much money 8,800 yen is, imagine one yen 8,800 times.
1602548	1604890	It's not over 9,000 though, so that's good.
1604930	1605631	It's like 85 bucks.
1607453	1607713	All right.
1609358	1613901	However, what's coming out right now is the 3.1 update for the Wii.
1614361	1617883	It's going to have USB keyboard support for everything.
1617903	1621885	Because remember before, the Wii update only had the limited USB support.
1622005	1623686	And how long did it take them to do this shit?
1623726	1624727	Come on, seriously.
1624787	1625928	This should have been in their...
1627737	1636061	and also with the new Wii update a brand new enhanced Everybody Votes channel and did they make the Everybody Votes channel interesting again?
1636522	1642485	Sadly no, they just added the USB keyboard support to the Everybody Votes channel so if you're actually still voting
1643326	1655153	of which I can't imagine there's that many people still voting, but if you are, then, well, you get a new enhanced version and you can submit your questions now using the keyboard so you can annoy Nintendo even faster with your questions like, what's better, cake or pie?
1655533	1656254	Cake or death?
1658675	1659996	What's a better way to die?
1660136	1661677	Fire, boat fire, you know?
1663258	1666580	And I encourage people to send their dumb questions to Nintendo because it's funny.
1667900	1668681	It's really funny.
1669941	1670562	Funny!
1671345	1700534	funny haha or funny oh fuck well for our friends in the UK we have a few updates to virtual console we have Super Metroid dun dun dun and it is 800 points uh 560 or 8 euro what Rob's giving me this look I'm like what so yeah go play Super Metroid all of you now
1702392	1708696	And then you also get, that was on the NES, you get Protector Bot 2, Return of the Evil Forces.
1709436	1711277	Known to us as Super Contra.
1711297	1716580	That's a retarded name that they... Protector Bot.
1716860	1719402	Contra came out of there as Protector Bot.
1720382	1720982	Protector Bot.
1721963	1723284	I think it had different sprites too.
1724404	1727066	Dude, Contra is just awesome, so whatever.
1728687	1729047	With blood.
1731108	1738233	Going to the chatroom, I was giggling because Nintendo Maniacs64 says, The best Everybody Votes channel question, what's better, the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3?
1740695	1745378	Let's see, SSJ100Matt thinks the Mii's will be the last unlockable character in Super Smash Bros.
1745418	1745718	Brawl.
1746539	1749441	VXChaseXP says, The Everybody Votes channel rules!
1749982	1753624	I vote every day, says our loyal webmaster, VXChaseXP.
1753684	1756306	So I just made fun of the guy that hosts our website for nothing.
1756567	1757027	Good job, Rob.
1758311	1760613	I thought Jason had more of a life than that.
1761774	1762114	You know what?
1762154	1763114	He's just very democratic.
1763175	1764295	He wants his voice to be known.
1764576	1767698	He wants people to know who he thinks should win American Idol.
1768118	1770540	He wants people to know what color is better.
1771220	1773222	What other kinds of dumbass things did they ask on there?
1773802	1778626	He wants people to know that he prefers winter over summer and all that crap.
1779106	1779386	All right.
1780427	1784049	And Jason Oches commented, gotta love this like, puppy should die in a boat fire.
1784170	1784590	There you go.
1789008	1814839	boat fire is okay at least there's water so finally it seems that Nintendo is going to be turning around this whole lack of stuff for Wii Online including of course they talked about the WiiWare service and they made some announcements of new titles that are going to be coming out for the WiiWare service including Pokemon Farm a Crystal Chronicles Yay!
1814979	1816259	Pokemon Farm!
1816279	1816640	Shut up!
1816800	1817420	Don't just poke
1818560	1842664	Crystal Chronicles game called The Young King and the Promised Land where you build your own country and let's see here also Star Soldier R and Dr. Mario Wii that's also going to be coming out as well of course no dates yet as far as when we're going to see them in the US or pretty much anywhere on Earth imagine next year at some point
1843383	1844984	Other games announced as well.
1845644	1849326	There was Mina de Puzzle Loop, which came out over here as Magnetica.
1849526	1850667	It's a ripoff of Zuma.
1851547	1858671	And then also, of course, there was a game called Marubo Shikaku.
1859211	1865854	And that's some weird thing that involves screens displaying different patterns, circle, line, and square based.
1866614	1867755	And no idea what the fuck that is.
1870023	1876829	Anyways, and of course, those are only kind of a little sampling of what's going to be coming.
1877230	1881794	Nintendo says that there's going to be over 100 WiiWare games that have been proposed to them.
1882214	1883836	And who knows?
1883996	1886438	We'll see some good original content coming in 2008.
1886599	1894166	I was going to say there was one other thing, too, that they showed off there real quick.
1894784	1895404	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1925390	1926711	Fuck yeah, it's about fucking time.
1953143	1955225	Yes, I wish to understand that you have a mudkip.
1955965	1957866	I would like to trade your mudkip for my pillup.
1960608	1963090	Hey, that pillup turns into a big buttfucker penguin.
1963671	1967093	That pillup turns into a big buttfucker penguin, to quote my girlfriend.
1970133	1972855	Anyhow, so WiiWare, lots of stuff coming out for the WiiWare.
1973216	1975278	Also, another game coming out, Wii Music.
1975398	1979461	Now, a lot of us saw this game at the very first time we saw the Wii at E3 2006.
1980102	1985086	Remember when, I think it was Miyamoto came out on stage, he's conducting the orchestra, da-da-da, what?
1986468	1991012	No, that was Miyamoto on the thing, but I saw Koji Kondo playing, and got his autograph.
1992347	1992927	www.DarkSakura.com
2007894	2010235	I want a band that has a zither, a harmonica, a melodica...
2037526	2041568	an auto harp, and one snare drum.
2042809	2048111	I would like Nintendo to know that if this game does not have a didgeridoo, it sucks.
2049691	2056414	Seriously, like, you better fucking have a didgeridoo in this game, because I want nothing to do with it if I cannot have my... A flugelhorn.
2056514	2056814	Anyway...
2066443	2067104	and a cowbell.
2067364	2068705	It has to have a cowbell.
2071648	2072729	It has to have a cowbell.
2072769	2085541	So we need a band with a didgeridoo, a zither, a cowbell, a flugelhorn, a sitar and a harmonica.
2086102	2088324	And this is why we don't let you guys make music.
2088718	2093824	Son of Dad would like there to be a skin flute in the game that you can play.
2109231	2111373	I like the sound of human screams.
2111433	2112494	Is that an instrument?
2112594	2113334	No, no, no.
2113774	2119098	If you need a game for that, then you need to do simple steps.
2120499	2121200	Stand up.
2122521	2123301	Go to your door.
2123802	2124242	Open it.
2124482	2125082	Walk out.
2125223	2126884	Closing the door is optional.
2127744	2130326	Go through the appropriate hallway to get to your front door.
2130566	2130987	Open it.
2131067	2131627	Step out.
2131787	2132147	Leave.
2133068	2134649	Experience nature.
2135470	2136410	Real life.
2138312	2138512	Get
2139452	2142033	I highly recommend that.
2142053	2145294	Okay, this coming from the bitch who wants a sitar in Wii Music.
2146555	2149636	I want an electric sitar, because sitars are sexy.
2150636	2150936	Anyway.
2152657	2154117	That's explicit on chat.
2155918	2158679	We were explicit from the moment you said surprise butt sex.
2162489	2163950	I make the explicit tag come up.
2164030	2165270	So, shall I continue?
2166250	2178373	For anyone who's looking forward to the new Mario Kart, you are going to be able to play up to 12 players online on Mario Kart Wii, which will officially make it the biggest Mario Kart ever.
2180574	2181334	As long as you do it right.
2182834	2188856	And as long as there's not two people on the car at the same time, because that's just going to be bad memories I don't want to revisit.
2190953	2192354	and also there's bikes now.
2193334	2194995	Wait, so now it's like Project Gotham 4?
2195295	2195535	Yeah.
2195715	2199177	Okay, I tried playing the motorbikes in Project Gotham 4, not pretty.
2199477	2201738	I'm really bad at Project Gotham racing.
2202098	2209421	And like, watching me race the motorbike in Project Gotham 4 was like watching me learn how to ride a bike for the first time.
2209461	2216985	I was like, I'm going left, I'm going right, and then left, right, and then I fall off and collapse in a big heap and my bike falls on top of me to add insult to injury.
2217385	2219826	Thank you, Project Gotham, for making me feel like a bad driver.
2221653	2227219	but yeah, there will be bikes which, it's like why the fuck do you need bikes?
2227579	2232204	I mean, the game was fine as Mario Kart it's not Mario Kart and stuff I mean, seriously
2233210	2255832	um anyways so Mario and Sonic at the Olympics they've already announced a bunch of really cool characters that you can play as but fuck that let's play as myself because you can play as your own me in the game because you know hey fuck all the time that you know it takes to actually put these wonderful characters in the game let's just have some dick put his own stupid me in there and play as himself hooray
2256601	2258082	Fuck that, I ain't buying the game anyways.
2258142	2259083	It's the fucking Olympics.
2259123	2260505	You're gonna trick me this time.
2260565	2264989	Hey, I like this idea because now, like, we can find out who's better, me or Mario.
2265609	2265849	Me.
2266470	2267711	Who's faster, me or Sonic?
2268031	2268211	Me.
2269412	2274597	I can now prove that I'm the best thing ever with my me, right?
2277380	2277880	It's all about me.
2278200	2279001	Yeah, it's all about me.
2280763	2281043	Anyhow.
2283269	2294316	One game that I'm glad my me cannot be put into is Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles because I would not want to die in this game or get shot or what have you or get my brains eaten by zombies.
2294837	2299060	But what you can get with the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles is the Wii Zapper.
2299360	2299640	That's right.
2299680	2303743	There's actually going to be a Wii Zapper combo coming out.
2304043	2307866	And although right now it looks like it's only coming out in Japan, you never know.
2308246	2311288	If you cross your fingers, hold your breath, it might come out over here on stateside.
2311328	2312489	Not gonna happen!
2312649	2313129	Why's that?
2313369	2314430	Because it's not gonna happen.
2314850	2315971	Japan gets all the cool shit.
2316131	2323697	Alright, well they also get with this cool shit called the Expert Package, a 28-page book called Wesker's Extra Report.
2324057	2325097	And they also get stickers.
2325117	2326418	Stickers!
2327079	2328240	Because who doesn't love stickers?
2329721	2331622	Well, I love that it says zombie pew pew.
2332663	2333003	Anyway...
2333627	2345512	Well, one thing though about the special editions is that when we got, when Biohazard Code Veronica came out over here, well, we didn't get the big briefcase that had the Wesker's files and everything.
2345652	2346793	Dan and I were tempted to order it.
2347213	2355977	However, what they did after the fact was release the Wesker report as a special disc, like a free giveaway.
2356717	2358358	And I got like a bunch of them.
2358978	2362060	But, you know, I think that we're going to get the stuff
2362782	2364804	It's just not going to be in the cool-ass bundle.
2365124	2366685	So, anyway.
2368327	2373951	Something that is happy yay face is... It's O-face.
2374191	2374432	Anyway.
2375973	2389564	If you get Contra 4, you are getting Contra... Not just that, you're getting Contra Super C and the Protector Bot from the UK version.
2389584	2389644	Wow.
2391297	2393318	Rob, stop having Pikachu fuck!
2396220	2399242	I'm just entertaining our Op11 people before they get cut off, but I'm listening.
2402023	2412309	The Op11 feed limits us to 40 minutes of recording, so... Anyway, so, um... So you get... Stop it!
2413730	2417452	So you get Contra, Super C, and you get the Protector Bot.
2417772	2418953	So, I bet you're happy.
2419699	2422040	and art galleries and comics and all that fun shit.
2422760	2424981	I don't know about the comics, but fun shit.
2426361	2448788	Anyways, so other things that you're going to get, including this week, lots of fun games coming out, including one game that's kind of infamous with this show, a certain game on the Xbox 360 to which you roll around a ball, we'll call it, and you roll over objects and you're, let's call them
2449215	2451317	The Prince, Mercury Meltdown Revolution
2471745	2472125	20 bucks.
2472285	2473546	That's not bad for that game.
2474586	2476947	Guilty Gear XX Accent Core.
2477367	2478208	That should be pretty cool.
2479068	2480269	Victoria's Boxers.
2480529	2484150	So if you're looking for an anime Mike Tyson's punch-out, maybe.
2485211	2486871	That doesn't sound very interesting at all.
2487372	2490713	It sounds like Victoria's secret is that she actually wears boxers.
2491914	2494315	Victorious, not Victoria boxers.
2495055	2496335	I thought you said Victoria's.
2496876	2498216	No, it's Victorious.
2499157	2499457	Never mind.
2499497	2499797	Anyways.
2501716	2503437	So other stuff coming out.
2503797	2505577	Tony Hawk's Proving Ground on almost everything.
2505838	2511240	PlayStation 2, 360, Wii, PlayStation 3, DS.
2511900	2513040	Avatar, The Burning Earth.
2513660	2516722	That's coming out on almost everything as well.
2517262	2518422	Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
2519122	2527345	The Shivering Owls expansion is coming out on a disc version for Xbox 360 as well as Oblivion, the Game of the Year edition is finally coming out for the PlayStation 3.
2529646	2530327	Let's see here.
2530627	2531187	On PSP
2531937	2539702	Spider-Man 3 is coming out, which, for those who don't remember, the game originally came out back in June on everything else.
2539882	2541703	Or actually, I think May on everything else.
2542224	2543685	And it sucked.
2544345	2544685	Let's see.
2544785	2547527	SWAT Target Liberties coming out on PSP as well.
2548428	2551330	Crash of the Titans is finally getting its PSP version coming out.
2553051	2553771	Let's see here.
2554152	2555072	Backyard Football 2008.
2556073	2556993	Don't touch that game.
2557033	2557834	It's horrible.
2559955	2560756	Let's see here.
2561465	2564948	And then on PC, there's a whole bunch of crap.
2565308	2566769	And then, let's see here.
2567249	2568951	Fury's coming out, so that's going to be pretty cool.
2571092	2571613	Flight Deck 5.
2572053	2573334	Yeah, that looks like shit.
2573434	2574235	Zoo Tycoon 2.
2574795	2577257	Because where would we be without a Tycoon game each week?
2579169	2580110	Finally, let's see here.
2580250	2584133	On the DS, Flash Focus Vision Training.
2584193	2589698	Yes, another fucking training game that Nintendo's going to sucker you into buying because you're blind without it.
2590258	2594281	And Disney Princess Magical Jewels is going to be coming out on the DS.
2595582	2599245	I do not want to see the princess's magical jewels because that sounds just really wrong.
2599426	2602048	And this, I'm sure, will make a certain chatter happy.
2602888	2606011	Hannah Montana Music Jam on the DS.
2608140	2609741	Fuck the chatters, I'm happy!
2611801	2613902	Are you paying $2,000 for a concert ticket?
2615283	2616623	No, I'm not stupid.
2616663	2617583	I'm happy, not stupid.
2617984	2618984	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2619784	2620124	What?
2621725	2622625	It's a wonderful game.
2622725	2627767	It's like jam sessions, except, well, you can, I don't know.
2630077	2631598	Jamie was asking me what.
2632358	2638219	I've seen it on CNN four times in the last month about how their concert tickets are getting sold by scalpers.
2638779	2645241	Real quick, though, and one other thing on the PC, Heroes of Might and Magic 5, Tribes of the East, that expansion is finally coming out as well.
2646001	2648242	So that is pretty much everything.
2648582	2652283	Well, then let's go to Japan and see what our friends overseas are getting this week.
2652723	2656344	They are also getting a game you may have heard of on this program.
2657332	2658232	Before we had to get rid of it.
2658272	2663734	Beautiful Katamari Damacy ships in Japan on October 18th on the Xbox 360.
2663794	2667575	Another game coming out on the Xbox 360, Zoids Alternative.
2667675	2669416	Not Zoinks, but Zoids Alternative.
2669816	2676518	And it kind of looks like a cyborg type game, but what I find very interesting is that the box art totally has Final Fantasy font.
2676979	2681100	But yet it has, like, it totally looks like a Final Fantasy game, but yet...
2682370	2684811	Nothing to do with Final Fantasy.
2684891	2688693	I noticed that it's a Takara game and Takara is responsible for Transformers over there.
2688933	2700157	Zoids is like a, I don't know, I call it a ripoff of like fucking, I don't know, like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers or maybe even like... Which was a ripoff on the Japanese franchise.
2701578	2705199	Exactly, and I'd say maybe even also a ripoff of Voltron a little bit.
2707231	2709552	Power Rangers destroyed my childhood.
2709852	2713973	Hitstun in our chatroom would like to remind us they've been making Zoids games since the NES.
2715394	2727718	I would also like to point out with all the ripping off thing and Rob bringing up the Final Fantasy font that it was Yoshitaka Amano who was in part responsible for us having the whole transforming team whatever mecha genre to begin with.
2728558	2730519	So he's responsible for the rape of my childhood.
2730639	2733960	He did the character designs for Kagaki Ninja Tai Gatchaman.
2734840	2735721	I don't care what anyone says.
2735781	2736421	Trini was hot.
2737902	2742405	Also hot is Tobey Maguire starring in Spider-Man 3 coming out on the PlayStation 3.
2744226	2746188	See how I took it right back on track?
2746208	2747208	That's so cool.
2747288	2748269	I like the Japanese.
2748929	2751251	Yeah, well, because it's the Japanese version.
2751271	2752912	That's why the box says Japanese writing.
2752952	2753432	Go figure.
2754853	2755454	It's interesting.
2755494	2756414	I don't see that every day.
2756735	2757315	PlayStation 3.
2758396	2759096	Don't panic.
2759556	2760137	Seaman 2.
2760897	2766041	Notice that is a sea man, not the other thing.
2766061	2766201	Wow.
2768698	2769439	No, no, no, no, no.
2769879	2774543	Dan and I sat around with our Dreamcast talking to our Seaman for how long?
2780607	2782088	How often do you talk to Dan's Seaman?
2783409	2785011	Dan was the one who talked to our Seaman.
2786352	2787973	And then they turned into man-frogs and left.
2793376	2794117	Make it stop!
2794698	2796040	Wow.
2796220	2800505	That sound you hear is millions of listeners across America throwing up into their mouths.
2801527	2801987	There you go.
2806551	2807852	That's true, Rob.
2808112	2810292	Do you know you can import this into America?
2810632	2813013	The bundle for Seaman 2 for the PlayStation 2.
2813053	2818275	The full title, Seaman 2 Peking Engine Ikusi Kit is coming out this week.
2818335	2820676	It's going to cost you 90 bucks if you want to import that sucker.
2820876	2823677	But that comes with a microphone so you can yell at your Seaman.
2824297	2824697	What is it?
2825017	2825357	I'm sorry.
2825837	2826778	I've never played that.
2828118	2832199	Seaman, first of all, when it came out over here, it was narrated by Leonard Nimoy and that was really cool.
2833540	2834280	You start off with these
2835279	2838880	These eggs, and you grow them into tadpoles, and they eventually grow human faces.
2839420	2844322	And you... Wait a minute, wait a minute.
2845602	2847322	Isn't that kind of like the other kind of Seaman?
2847883	2848383	Does that too?
2848823	2850403	Allow me to continue.
2851204	2852264	I grant thee permission.
2853464	2855145	Someone take the mic away from Rob.
2857425	2860826	See, I like having two mics now, because I can tell Rob to STFU.
2861967	2862867	Continue, I want... Anyway.
2863187	2863407	Anyway.
2864125	2868827	So they speak this own little nonsense language and you talk to them.
2869728	2874290	And eventually they start talking back and they build their vocabulary as you talk to them.
2874690	2877952	And then they start speaking in this distinguished sort of posh British accent.
2880233	2886896	And then you have conversations with them and they ask you questions and then they remember the things that you've answered.
2887740	2895705	and they ask you your birthday and you speak back and forth to them and you monitor their habitat, make sure that the water is right, feed them every day.
2896486	2897886	But eventually they start eating each other.
2900708	2903170	I know, it's fantastic.
2903550	2905251	Or like one will die or something.
2905591	2908693	Wait, okay, so it's like Pokemon and the Sims combined.
2909353	2910154	But you talk to them.
2910654	2912956	And you're teaching them to say damn fucking shit.
2912976	2913076	No.
2913136	2913256	No.
2914342	2915103	They have everything.
2915143	2917024	It's programmed in, but it's very interesting.
2917144	2921767	How has this game not shown up on my radar in the years that we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio?
2921827	2923788	Five and a half years and I've never heard of this game.
2923828	2924249	What the hell?
2924269	2924989	Do you want to borrow mine?
2925269	2925910	I think so.
2926470	2927731	Do you have a working VMU?
2929152	2929812	Actually, I do.
2930013	2930313	Okay.
2930813	2931634	I still have my chow.
2931654	2933095	I have the Dreamcast hooked up in the garage.
2933395	2934936	I can play Seaman all night long.
2936197	2936697	At any rate...
2939306	2942208	As you progress through the game, you have another tank that's a terrarium.
2942609	2949775	So you're actually growing another environment, and after a while, your seaman's going to start floundering around and start turning into a cocoon.
2953398	2954679	I can't stop laughing!
2954699	2957482	I'm trying to take the mic from Rob!
2958803	2965249	And then you eventually move the cocoon into the terrarium, and it hatches into a frogman.
2966460	2968422	And then he leaves, and the game is over.
2970943	2975226	See, and then in the sequel game, you actually, your guy turns into a caveman.
2975767	2978929	And so, thus the cycle starts all over again.
2979730	2980350	Think about it.
2982572	2985174	So he turns into a caveman, so he can do Geico commercials.
2986815	2988856	There's a series about that now.
2989297	2993600	And they sold that from Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer on Saturday Night Live.
2993956	2995657	Why'd y'all have to remind us about that show?
2995838	2997859	I mean, just when I purged it from my memory.
2997999	2999100	So, my turn, right?
2999581	3000201	Or do you have more stuff?
3000221	3001362	No, I have more stuff, actually.
3001402	3002883	We got sidetracked by Seaman.
3003424	3005485	But the sequel to Seaman's coming out on the PlayStation 2.
3005545	3010089	Okay, Galaxy Angel 2, Mugen Karunokagi is coming out.
3010349	3014172	I have no idea what the hell this game is, but you know it's cool because it's by a company called Broccoli.
3015333	3018315	Broccoli did DigiCarrot.
3018916	3019556	Ah, very cool.
3019777	3020417	Well, there you go.
3020477	3022639	So, from the people who brought you DigiCarrot.
3023783	3052054	so Sonic Rush Adventure is coming out on the Nintendo DS from Sega and also in Japan this week on the PSP Riviera Yasuko Nochi Special Edition is coming out and looks like another game based off an anime surprise surprise that's it my turn and coming out over in the UK on the 16th Warmonger Operation Downtown Destruction 17th Speedball 2 Brutal Deluxe everything else is coming out on the 19th
3053923	3060227	Eternal Sonata for Xbox 360, Football Manager 2008, which, by the way, is real football and not the shit we have in America.
3061668	3072836	Galactic Assault, Half-Life 2, Episode 2, King of Clubs, Lair, Life Science, Hospital Affairs, Luminous, Ark, Myst, Naruto, Ultimate Ninja, and Naruto Ultimate Ninja 2.
3073296	3075537	Like, they get the game and then they get the sequel the same day.
3075918	3076258	Why?
3077941	3083644	Portal on Xbox 360, Pursuit Force Extreme Justice, Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis.
3084284	3085564	Didn't that already come out?
3085584	3088306	They're just getting Portal on Xbox 360?
3089386	3089606	Yeah.
3089626	3090487	They're just getting Portal.
3091027	3093688	I would just buy Portal and skip Half-Life altogether.
3094949	3102972	Also, Tabula Rasa on PC, Team Fortress 2, The Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, The Orange Box on Xbox 360.
3103392	3105273	Why did they get an option of getting Portal?
3106474	3106774	I don't know.
3107557	3108418	I think it might be a typo.
3109799	3112280	You can buy it standalone here, but only on the PC.
3112641	3113421	You can get it through Steam.
3113481	3114062	It's Xbox 360.
3114982	3115382	Bastards.
3117904	3121867	Thrillville Off the Rails, also coming out on damn near everything else.
3124229	3126810	Oh yeah, I forgot Thrillville Off the Rails is also coming out in the US.
3127871	3129292	It's fun, you get to make people hurl.
3130113	3130553	Yee.
3131534	3131874	Anyways.
3132898	3142146	Something else that's coming out here pretty soon and unfortunately is the last in the long line of download content for Oblivion is the brand new Fighter Stronghold.
3142766	3150212	It is the same price as a Yaris Xbox Live Arcade game, but way better.
3151133	3158859	And it will be coming out, it's actually going to be free beginning on October 15th, but it's only free for a week.
3159879	3160520	I need to remember that.
3160970	3161810	Make sure you download it.
3161910	3169254	It's the last bit of download content you're going to see for Oblivion, so what a way to close it off for free.
3170594	3171335	Well, here you go.
3171475	3177838	This show actually will go to its podcast form on the 15th, which is the way most people listen to the program, so go check Xbox Live.
3177858	3178538	It should be up now.
3178818	3180639	Friendly reminder from the folks here at OLR.
3181676	3186557	Also, the other thing, here's some of the cool features, though, that the Fighter Stronghold comes with.
3187317	3194018	You can get your own, I guess, Venter to create your own wines for you.
3194538	3199059	You have a combat trainer, a taxidermist to create trophies for your pad.
3199379	3200979	Oh, that's cool.
3201520	3203280	They also, I think there was some other stuff.
3203620	3207661	Basically, you get this whole castle to run after you do a little quest to get.
3208181	3209641	So, fucking awesome.
3210049	3214731	That would be so cool to just fill my castle with a bunch of dead bears.
3215051	3217692	Seriously, how is Elder Scrolls V going to top Oblivion?
3217952	3218492	I don't know.
3218652	3223294	I mean, like, Oblivion, I mean, this is literally saying, look, we're going to give you the kitchen sink in this game.
3223994	3224894	I mean, it's everything.
3225054	3225875	It's amazing.
3226175	3227015	It is amazing.
3229776	3230616	It's a video game, Chris.
3230636	3232937	You don't actually have to have real pets on your wall.
3232957	3235298	I know, but it's only fun to kill the simpets.
3237279	3237539	Chris.
3237579	3238560	But still.
3238600	3239300	You're so difficult to please.
3239320	3242220	But in The Sims, you can't throw fireballs at things.
3245221	3246581	I mean, look, I'll tell you what, Chris.
3246621	3250682	There's nothing funner in Oblivion than throwing fireballs at the sheep constantly.
3251323	3253543	And then they start to attack you.
3254243	3255624	They figure out you're a bad man.
3256564	3257684	If they live long enough.
3258144	3259365	That is awesome.
3260685	3261985	When sheep attack.
3264066	3264866	It's pretty bad.
3265566	3268355	Alright, as was that joke.
3271063	3271444	Moving on.
3272726	3276189	Sierra Online, also Vivendi Games, is part of that.
3276589	3282454	They have given us some more details about what is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and PC through the rest of the year.
3282774	3287399	There is a third-person retro arcade shooter called Aces of the Galaxy.
3288219	3290061	There's another title called Boogie Bunnies.
3290701	3294445	This is a game where players match rabbits in a match-three puzzle game.
3294785	3297748	Those are both coming out on the PC and Xbox Live Arcade.
3297828	3298588	Rabbit threesomes?
3299502	3301984	X-Box Live Arcade Shooter Assault Heroes Arcadian Warriors
3319808	3343767	and 33, Scar, Resurrection Ship, Exodus, and the one some people have been looking forward to or not looking forward to because it may bastardize what they know and love, Battlestar Galactica, where you can play as the humans or the Cylons, 16-player online gaming on the PC, 8 players on Xbox Live Arcade, even though the early reviews on that were mediocre at best, but, you know, they've had a long time since then.
3343787	3345448	I'm sure that was an early version, so you never know.
3345929	3346549	Well, who knows?
3346789	3347310	Let's be fair.
3347570	3348851	Like time makes games better.
3349039	3349599	I don't feel so bad now!
3349679	3350399	But I have Doctor Who.
3374167	3380910	Anyway, anyone who cares, Speedball 2 is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.
3381510	3382211	I care, Jamie.
3385592	3392275	And I think this is funny that it was referred to like this on Joystick, that it's like Calvin Ball.
3393356	3394856	For anyone who reads Calvin and Hobbes.
3395817	3397858	Calvin Ball is the game where you make up your own rules.
3398958	3399418	As you go.
3399779	3400779	I demand euphoria.
3402759	3430785	so yeah, Calvin Ball the game anyways let's see here for those who may not be into Calvin Ball there are some other tidbits on Xbox Live Marketplace that you might be interested in including a whole fucking ton of demos the Simpsons game is actually on there now definitely check it out I forgot I did play that this week awesome, awesome game if you're a Simpsons fan you're going to love it
3431422	3435569	Conan, which of course is based off the movie and comic series.
3435870	3437332	And it's supposed to be very, very bloody.
3437653	3439015	I haven't got a chance to play it yet.
3439035	3439597	I will soon.
3439797	3440278	I tried it.
3441093	3443234	I could not understand the control system at all.
3443734	3444394	So, I don't know.
3444654	3449575	I just hit, mash one button, swung my sword, and there was lots of blood, and I died a lot.
3449655	3453877	But at least that's why they have demos, so you don't have to waste $60 to find that out.
3454917	3456977	Project Gotham Racing 4 is up there now.
3457117	3458118	I played that one.
3458218	3460898	It's pretty, it's fun, but I really suck at it.
3460958	3462479	Like, I cannot control the car for shit.
3462619	3467120	I just have not figured out, like, the only racing game I can control worth a damn besides Mario Kart is Burnout.
3467420	3468901	Like, these other ones, I can't do it.
3468961	3470081	I keep crashing into walls.
3470561	3475965	I highly recommend, Rob, I swear you're going to love this game, Flat Out Ultimate Destruction.
3475985	3477125	Oh, I played the demo for that, too.
3477686	3477986	I did.
3478346	3480047	Based on your recommendation, I downloaded the demo for that.
3480347	3481108	It was kind of fun.
3481148	3487392	A little clunkier than Burnout for me, but I like the fact that when you ran people off the road, it actually told you who you just killed.
3487812	3488493	That was pretty fun.
3488573	3489633	And they get pissed off at you, too.
3489734	3489954	Yes.
3490374	3491195	So that was good.
3491315	3491875	That was good.
3491935	3493216	Yeah, Ultimate Destruction.
3493236	3496318	And the majority of them were hot chicks that I was offing, so...
3496778	3497099	Sorry, babe.
3497139	3497319	Woohoo.
3516812	3525315	All right, well, Microsoft is cracking down on naughty, naughty, naughty, very naughty mottos that people have in their gamer tag.
3525375	3530917	Not so much the tag itself, but you know how everybody on Xbox 360 gets a motto, a little line that they can have under their name?
3531477	3533818	Like, for instance, mine is OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
3534158	3535619	Trying to plug the site in very cheap ways.
3535959	3540321	So when people kick my ass at Halo, they'll go, hey, let's check out this guy's crappy podcast that he does with his friends.
3540821	3542061	So, yeah, that's there.
3542081	3543302	I don't know what you guys have for your mottos.
3543322	3544362	What do you have for your motto, Loki?
3546144	3546725	I don't remember.
3547085	3547866	You don't remember?
3548487	3548888	Wow.
3548928	3550470	Does anybody... What's yours, puppy?
3550590	3550990	Do you remember?
3552532	3553513	I honestly... You know what?
3553694	3555316	I only made it a month ago and I don't remember it.
3555856	3557038	Because it's really not important.
3557318	3560662	I think to be funny the first time, I think I had it so much fun.
3561163	3564247	And then I think I just changed it to the website.
3564707	3564968	Nice.
3565419	3572261	Well, one of our fellow independent podcasters found out the hard way that Microsoft is actually keeping an eye on those mottos.
3572601	3577002	Cheapy D over at the CheapAssGamer, they're the guys that won the podcast award this year.
3577782	3578523	So, good for them.
3579183	3584764	But they got banned from Xbox Live for a day for saying, Konichiwa, bitches, in their motto.
3585365	3593387	Apparently Microsoft does not appreciate the word bitch, because poor Cheapy D. Yeah, they're offended by the word Konichiwa.
3593427	3593827	Come on.
3596155	3601799	You know what's funny is that when I read that, I think of the Robins song, but maybe I'm just, I don't know, I'm crazy.
3602139	3608643	Anyway, also, another user on the site, an unnamed user, but I think I actually know who this might be if you listen to All Games Radio.
3608684	3611946	There is a person whose motto was, called the shit poop.
3612406	3613186	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3636064	3639950	Here's my thing is I want to know what exactly does Microsoft consider offensive?
3640471	3642273	I'm like, the bans are just for a day.
3642654	3643896	So let's have a little fun with this.
3643916	3644917	Let's push the limits.
3645358	3649564	So tonight I'm going to change my motto to fisting fan.
3651969	3656052	And I want to see if anybody catches that that could be actually a pornographic thing.
3656272	3658834	I meant like karate fisting.
3661235	3666159	We'll see what happens.
3667459	3671962	So I'm going to change my motto tonight to like I heart fisting or fisting fan or fan of fisting.
3672303	3674464	And I want to see if that will get by the censors.
3674664	3675465	So we'll see what happens.
3678187	3681649	One of Dan's friends, his gamer tag
3682424	3689026	is, um, uh, okay, I have to think of how he has it, um, DuckMySock.
3691807	3703710	Um, apparently, um, one of the listeners over at All Games, Flaming Bozo is reporting, uh, one of the other listeners at All Games, Buck Fush, is his nickname, Buck Fush got banned for a day because his motto said Bush Plan 9-11.
3704870	3706691	Apparently, that was a no-no.
3706711	3711072	Who cares?
3711092	3711432	Seriously, my girl?
3712987	3714548	Seriously, Microsoft, who cares?
3715068	3716709	Okay, Loki, a seat now, good.
3717089	3717530	I like this.
3717570	3722152	The chatroom is coming up with things that are questionably offensive for us to put in our mottos.
3722432	3725114	So, Loki, you're going to use this one from Takeo Rei, okay?
3725474	3727075	Dirty Sanchez is all around.
3729937	3732298	Can you change your motto to that and see if you get banned for a day?
3733358	3734299	It's just a day.
3735119	3735940	It's just one day.
3735980	3737061	You can go without Halo for a day.
3737081	3738702	I can get banned for other reasons, but...
3740134	3742716	Son of Dad's new motto says, Halo soaks cork.
3756085	3757866	Frisbee says, buy a Wii.
3758766	3760767	I don't have an Xbox in my garage.
3760787	3761528	This is on Xbox, right?
3761548	3761848	I'm sorry.
3762168	3762748	No, it's 360.
3762848	3763508	Oh, 360, okay.
3763869	3766430	Well, Megsie's got one, but she doesn't have time to play because she's stuttering for finals.
3766470	3773493	But can someone in chat, for me, or anyone who's listening, like, who wants to actually participate, add something to the lesbian?
3773873	3775354	Or, like, I like dykes or something.
3776134	3776934	Carpet muncher.
3776974	3777895	Carpet muncher.
3779135	3779675	How do you know?
3779735	3780636	That could be my cat.
3781221	3781481	That's true.
3781501	3782881	I think it's a special time, Rob.
3810360	3813344	Color of Sakura is going to change his motto to save the rug doctor.
3813824	3814725	Oh, God, yes.
3815166	3816027	That's awesome.
3817068	3821613	So we need to start a thread in the forums for questionable mottos that get caught by Microsoft.
3821913	3823635	Yeah, that would be funny.
3823675	3826879	Somebody start that up, orangejohnsradio.com, forums.
3827557	3828217	Plug, plug.
3828578	3831820	Or, like, have one that says, like, I want a fag, or something like that.
3831920	3833161	Yeah, but fag means cigarette, right?
3833181	3833641	Yeah, exactly.
3833681	3834402	Okay, here's the thing.
3834842	3838004	If you get banned for reels, like, permanently, though, you can't blame us, okay?
3838064	3842988	You're doing this at your own, because I don't want no, like, lawsuit, like, oh, those assholes on Oregon Radio told me to change my mind.
3843028	3844449	No, you're doing it for yourself, okay?
3845189	3848011	But we really appreciate it, so give it to pure pleasure.
3848932	3850453	But only cool kids do it.
3850473	3851093	Segment.
3854015	3854315	Ah, yes.
3855036	3855376	I'm sorry.
3855696	3856857	We have a segment coming up now.
3859065	3861666	Because we're over an hour now, so it's time for Part A to finish up.
3861686	3870167	And you know we like to close out Part A here at Orange Lounge Radio by respecting our elders and paying tribute to a classic video game.
3870508	3873528	It's DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week.
3873548	3877549	So DarkSakura, what game should all the kids be putting in their Gamefly queues right now?
3882630	3884170	The Classic Game of the Week.
3884650	3887451	For all of you awesome people who own a Saturn.
3889620	3895030	Magical Night's Dream Cotton Boomerang, which is a fantastic game.
3896893	3898696	Cotton Boomerang is actually...
3900007	3901888	A Saturn port of Cotton 2.
3902689	3909954	So actually, if you've got MAME, you can play the game on your emulator, and it'll run just fine.
3910054	3917579	But it was basically going back to the original Cotton, the way that it worked, as being a side-scrolling shooter with extra fun.
3917779	3920641	And I know I've talked about Panorama Cotton and Rainbow Cotton a lot.
3921382	3926025	Those are sort of special in the series, in the fact that they are...
3927003	3930224	Behind the Character View, and they're actually kind of hard to play.
3930584	3944448	But Cotton Boomerang is completely side-scroller with lovely animation for the levels, but you also get pretty much unlimited magic, and you get all these different skill items that you can use in the game.
3944888	3949350	My favorite item in this game is this big ball of fire.
3949430	3953671	And what you do with the big ball of fire is you bounce it.
3954777	3970801	and you actually will have lines of enemies that come at you and you can bounce the ball at and it'll just knock out completely lines of you know complete lines of enemies and the cool thing about the Cotton series though is that there was also this collector um thing that if you got different um
3971937	3974178	Cotton Games, like Panorama Cotton was one.
3974498	3979561	And keep in mind, they only made something about 600 copies in this game.
3980121	3985604	And there were only 300 of these tea mugs, tea cups that they issued out.
3985904	3989126	There was one with the original cotton version.
3989746	3991087	There was the Panorama Cotton one.
3991107	3995509	There's Cotton 2 cup, but they don't know how many of them are out in circulation.
3995529	3997670	But these are like lots of money now, anyway.
3999345	4008732	Actually, for anyone who wants to play any of the Cotton games, if you've got a Neo Geo Pocket Color, and I think it actually came out on DS, I want to say.
4009593	4011134	There's also a Super Nintendo version.
4011154	4017779	They did release Cotton on a number of systems, but I'd have to say of the side scrollers, the best of them is Cotton 2.
4018080	4021923	It's just really, really a lot of fun.
4023324	4025946	And I love that in the bonus stages, we pick up teacups.
4027276	4031841	I just like the concept of a side-scrolling shooter game starring witches flying on brooms.
4031881	4033302	That's just kind of rad and original.
4033463	4040970	The whole story behind it is that Cotton is this little witch girl who's addicted to this candy called Willow that makes her throw up.
4042832	4047037	And she rescues... Kind of like how I'm addicted to crack.
4047918	4048879	It makes me throw up too.
4049579	4049920	Whatever.
4050513	4055316	Anyway, um, and she rescues this, um, fairy, oh, this fairy named Silk comes to get her help.
4055776	4056496	That's her, by the way.
4057437	4061219	That's a sexy mama that comes up there on the little stage selection screen.
4061739	4063280	Is that Cotton's lesbian lover?
4063320	4064140	What is that?
4064180	4065321	That's the fairy Silk.
4066181	4076947	Well, of course, there has to be some gratuitous... And the whole point of this game is that, and the whole reason that the character is participating in this adventure at all is because either she wants candy...
4077967	4089696	or someone is threatening her supply of candy and she's only doing it for the candy, she could give a shit about the trials and tribulations of the land she's rescuing because she wants candy.
4089996	4090737	Is she single?
4091597	4093739	Probably.
4094099	4095180	She's also a little girl.
4096661	4099703	Cotton is a little girl.
4101084	4102245	She's a very little girl.
4103066	4104587	The graphics are just awesome.
4104647	4106048	Rob's got something on YouTube.
4106782	4112344	This, yeah, this, yeah, video one, and it's pretty much showing what the game is looking like.
4112704	4114345	And the graphics, how old is this game?
4114685	4115866	This came out on the Sega Saturn.
4115906	4117846	Um, I do believe, The graphics are awesome!
4117906	4120827	I do, I do want to say that this game came out in 95?
4121008	4124089	I want to say.
4124489	4124669	Really?
4124689	4127350	Because, yeah, the Saturn in Japan came out when, 93, Rob?
4128791	4134353	Um, no, it came out in 94 because my, um, my, I had just started college, and my friend imported a Saturn that year.
4135153	4135213	Um,
4135879	4144274	But yeah, I want to say that Cotton Boomerang came out in 95, and it's, you know, for anyone who's a fan of 2D shooters, this game is gorgeous.
4144655	4145216	I mean, really.
4145236	4145997	Yeah, it really is.
4146418	4147741	And it's a ton of fun.
4148533	4156600	So I'd say anyone who's got MAME or the equivalent, if you want to play it on one of your emulators, you'll find it as Cotton 2.
4157560	4159842	But if you've got a Saturn, find this game if you can.
4159902	4161103	It's really a ton of fun.
4161524	4166107	And I can say that I have played through Cotton 2, or Cotton Boomerang, and it's really great.
4166608	4167709	I don't actually own it myself.
4168549	4174274	Cotton Boomerang or Cotton 2 is the classic game of the week, as judged by DarkSakura.
4174912	4175292	Very cool.
4175312	4176033	This game looks like fun.
4176053	4178035	I'm actually thinking I want to check that out too at some point.
4178095	4179055	So, very cool.
4179676	4180917	I'm liking this new segment.
4181117	4181838	What do you guys think?
4181898	4184300	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us an email.
4184320	4190284	If you have a suggestion, a game that Jamie needs to check out to consider for the segment, even though I think you have like your next month and a half already picked out.
4191305	4195929	Actually, I make sure to pick them out ahead of time.
4196297	4197918	And Dirtetsia, thank you.
4198139	4203403	He posted a link to the Panorama Cotton Mega Drive one that has the teacup with it.
4203823	4206726	And I actually do know somebody who has a copy of Panorama Cotton.
4206746	4214832	If anybody wants to have a headache, then go on YouTube and look at... Well, actually, Panorama Cotton, I've played on the Genesis Emulator, but my friend owns a legit copy.
4215853	4219036	It really is fun, but Rainbow Cotton was really fun, too.
4219116	4220137	That was the Dreamcast version.
4220477	4221758	It's the same type of game.
4222419	4222699	All right.
4223186	4226730	Well, that's going to do it for Orange Lounge Radio, this Part A of our podcast.

4272310	4273971	I made a bad boo-boo when I was late.
4292176	4304621	I made myself look very unprofessional, but I'll tell you more about that in part B. For those of you guys listening on OrangeLawnsRadio.com, you're getting some music, specifically tonight, some of the music from the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 3 soundtrack.
