0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Mojo!
13000	20000	Tonight, October 14th, 2007, Nintendo unveils holiday news that includes a dreaded delay,
20000	25000	Elder Scrolls Oblivion gets one last hurrah, and we're joined by members of Bizarre Creations
25000	27000	to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxy.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37000	42000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
49000	58000	We sound a little dead, it's because this is now our third time trying to record the show, and Jamie has-
58000	61000	Wait, wait a minute, this was empty a minute ago and now it's full again.
61000	66000	This is Mountain Dew gamer feel that Chris brought for Dark Sakura.
66000	67000	It's like cocaine.
67000	68000	What does it taste like?
68000	74000	The taste is like sort of like orange cream soda, but the first taste of it is sort of like very orange-y fruit punch,
74000	76000	and the aftertaste of it is cream soda.
76000	77000	Interesting.
77000	79000	It's fairly accurate, wouldn't you say?
79000	83000	It tastes like butt. No, I don't know, I didn't like it so much.
83000	84000	Kind of.
84000	88000	Also joining us tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
88000	94000	Hello, since his mic cord does not reach.
94000	95000	No, it's fine.
95000	97000	I think they're speaking in two microphones.
97000	99000	No, I don't need to speak in two microphones.
99000	103000	Okay, the problem we're having tonight, folks, is that we're down to two microphones.
103000	109000	The microphone that Loki usually uses died while we were trying to tape live here on this lovely Sunday evening,
109000	111000	so Loki's mic is gone.
111000	116000	So now we're having to share between the five people who are in studio tonight, two microphones.
116000	121000	So we apologize if there's any audio delays or audio slowing or other audio issues,
121000	124000	but this is what happens when you do live radio, folks.
124000	127000	When things break, you don't have much time to fix it.
127000	129000	So Loki's over there.
129000	130000	So yes, Dark Sakura.
130000	134000	You should put on cam the thing that I gave you today.
134000	135000	I gave it to my room.
135000	137000	You're mean.
137000	143000	I will go get it during a story later, but it's Tengen Fantasy Zone on the NES, the classic Game of the Week last week.
143000	144000	Very good.
144000	149000	We'll all be seeing what Dark Sakura picked for her Game of the Week this week a little later.
149000	153000	I don't have $100, though, to buy you the game for this week.
153000	154000	That's all right.
154000	155000	We'll get to that in a little bit.
155000	159000	Anyhow, let's introduce our guests who are here in studio for the madness tonight
159000	161000	and the third time we're getting to our show.
161000	163000	Say hello once again to Puppy.
163000	164000	Hello.
164000	168000	And what's ironic is Puppy came back tonight because he didn't get to talk too much last week.
168000	172000	And now that we're down another microphone, he probably won't get to talk much tonight at all.
172000	174000	So give it up for Puppy while you can, everybody.
174000	177000	I'm an attention whore, so say hi to me or whatever.
177000	180000	Ask me questions.
180000	181000	Or talk to me.
181000	183000	What is your name?
183000	184000	My name is Black Lab.
184000	187000	What is your quest?
187000	189000	Ultimate power.
189000	191000	What is the airspeed velocity of a swallow...
191000	194000	No, forget it.
194000	196000	God, you guys are crazy.
196000	201000	What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
201000	203000	Is it African or European swallow?
203000	205000	I don't know that.
205000	208000	Wow.
208000	213000	Anyhow, let's also say hello to a very special guest.
213000	214000	I was surprised.
214000	215000	I didn't even know she was coming tonight.
215000	216000	It's Chris, everybody.
216000	218000	Surprise, butt sex!
218000	220000	Wow.
220000	225000	Sorry, I got to keep my voice down because it's the acoustics in this room.
225000	226000	That's all right.
226000	227000	Kind of interesting.
227000	230000	And Chris is one of the official lesbians of Orange Lounge Radio.
230000	238000	And I'm actually surprised to see her back because I was thinking you were going to be flying to Wisconsin soon, right?
238000	242000	Oh, well, I went to GeekCon last week, but that was only for a week.
242000	246000	And in March I am officially moving to Wisconsin for my school career.
246000	248000	Jamie's helping me.
248000	250000	I am leaving.
250000	253000	I am going into U-Haul with Chris and I'm leaving.
253000	254000	She's coming back.
254000	256000	I am not. Shut up.
256000	257000	I'm kidding.
257000	259000	I was trying to be funny.
259000	260000	Oh, okay.
260000	262000	I'm sorry. I failed at it.
262000	263000	I failed.
263000	264000	Fail!
264000	265000	You're not doing it right.
265000	267000	You're not doing it right.
267000	269000	So I'm trying to hang out with you guys as much as possible.
269000	270000	All right.
270000	272000	Well, it's all good. We're glad to have you here.
272000	276000	And thank you to Chris for unlocking the explicit tag on tonight's program.
276000	277000	Sorry.
277000	278000	There you go.
278000	279000	All right.
279000	280000	I do that.
280000	281000	All right.
281000	287000	Anyhow, let's start off with how was your gaming week and we'll take it over to DarkSakura.
287000	289000	How was your gaming week?
289000	294000	It was Ragnarok and it was lots of Ragnarok.
294000	301000	I deleted a character and restarted one and I got two of them past job 50 and I played a lot.
301000	305000	And I looked at your copy of Every Extend Extra and couldn't find the PSP.
305000	306000	Wow.
306000	307000	You accomplished a lot.
307000	309000	And I bought a game and I gave it to you.
309000	310000	Yes.
310000	311000	Fantasy Zone.
311000	313000	And then I don't have an old school Nintendo to play it on.
313000	314000	But I have three.
314000	315000	Sweet.
315000	316000	I will lend you one.
316000	317000	Yay.
317000	318000	Maybe our top loader.
318000	322000	That would be cool because then I won't have to go to get games to play.
322000	323000	Oh, yeah.
323000	324000	Damn it.
324000	325000	All right.
325000	327000	Puppy, since you have the mic, how was your gaming week?
327000	329000	We'll have to do a different order because of the audio issues tonight.
329000	331000	How was your gaming week, Puppy?
331000	334000	I spent too much time playing Halo again.
334000	339000	But then I also spent the rest of it beta testing the new stuff on WoW that's coming
339000	340000	out in a couple weeks.
340000	342000	Don't forget, even with that mic you had to get really close.
342000	343000	There you go.
343000	344000	I have to watch the green lines.
344000	347000	I want big lines.
347000	348000	So, Halo.
348000	349000	Lots of Halo.
349000	350000	Yeah.
350000	351000	Halo and WoW.
351000	354000	What's your ratio in Halo?
354000	355000	More than one.
355000	356000	That's good.
356000	358000	Mine is less than 0.75.
358000	360000	That's bad.
360000	362000	I think I'm like 1.6.
362000	363000	Oh, wow.
363000	364000	That's pretty good.
364000	365000	I know.
365000	367000	I'm not that good, though.
367000	369000	I still suck on occasion.
369000	370000	All right.
370000	371000	Well, let's move on.
371000	374000	Chris, how was your gaming week?
374000	375000	Wow.
375000	376000	It was fun.
376000	383000	Megzi finally caved in thanks to peer pressure to get World of Warcraft.
383000	385000	And she bought me an account for a month.
385000	389000	So I've been kind of trying to use that up as much as possible to try to make it worth
389000	390000	my while.
390000	396000	So I've been playing a lot of that and dying a lot, which is always a favorite pastime.
396000	399000	Well, honey, Mac.
399000	401000	So, virtual PC.
401000	402000	Virtual PC doesn't let...
402000	403000	I don't have...
403000	405000	Well, it works on Mac.
405000	407000	I just don't have that much room on my...
407000	409000	I think that Ragnarok would run on a 486.
409000	412000	Because it was probably created on one.
412000	416000	I like my dancing blood elves.
416000	417000	That's okay.
417000	419000	Dancing blood elves are fun.
419000	420000	And good for you being Horde.
420000	421000	Yes.
421000	422000	For the Horde.
422000	423000	For the Alliance.
423000	424000	Do Draenei.
424000	425000	Who Alliance?
425000	426000	Draenei are okay.
426000	427000	I can do Draenei.
427000	428000	Okay.
428000	429000	Because they speak like Russians.
429000	430000	That's kind of cool.
430000	431000	That's enough rage.
431000	432000	Loki.
432000	434000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
434000	435000	It was good.
435000	436000	I played...
436000	438000	Let's see what I play here.
438000	439000	Halo 3.
439000	441000	I've gotten actually a little bit further in Legendary.
441000	444000	Now I'm, I think, on the 5th chapter or whatever.
444000	445000	5 out of 10.
445000	446000	Halfway through the game.
446000	447000	So it's doing pretty good.
447000	450000	I just have no idea how the hell I'm going to finish the last part of the game.
450000	454000	Because that's where the difficulty really ramped up.
454000	455000	And then, let's see.
455000	457000	Of course, more Saints Row multiplayer.
457000	460000	That's fun now because we've been playing in the Ultra Dome.
460000	464000	And we've been trying to jump cars to the top tier.
464000	466000	And actually have been quite successful at that.
466000	469000	So now it's who can get to the top tier the quickest.
469000	472000	And then try to survive without getting hit by rockets.
472000	474000	That's fun.
474000	476000	And then, let's see.
476000	480000	I've also been playing Half Life 2, the Orange Box.
480000	482000	Mainly Portal on that.
482000	484000	And that's pretty fun.
484000	489000	I was hoping someone on the show called Orange Lounge Radio would have been playing the Orange Box this week.
489000	491000	Because I know it wasn't me.
491000	492000	Although I think I might have to get it.
492000	493000	So how is Orange Box?
493000	494000	It's awesome.
494000	497000	Does it give Orange a good name when we trash it constantly every week?
497000	499000	It is the worst box art I've ever seen.
499000	502000	But it's cool, I guess.
502000	504000	I mean the game itself is pretty good.
504000	507000	I haven't really touched much of the other parts of the game.
507000	510000	You know, all other total 5 games on there.
510000	511000	Just mainly Portal.
511000	513000	But Portal is fun.
513000	515000	And, I don't know.
515000	517000	Just kind of playing through that a little bit.
517000	523000	Then, watching my wife play Puzzle Quest on, you know, the 360.
523000	526000	Which is, you know, just like Puzzle Quest on everything else.
526000	531000	And then, I played the Yaris game.
531000	534000	God, what the fuck?
534000	536000	I don't even know.
536000	538000	It's free, but I feel like I'm being ripped off.
538000	542000	It's, you know, seriously.
542000	548000	Just because it's, I understand why it's free, because there's no way anyone would pay for that shit.
548000	553000	I just, it was, it reminded me of like, was it Sonic the Hedgehog 2?
553000	555000	Like the bonus stages and that.
555000	557000	Except really crappy and made no sense.
557000	559000	And it was just stupid.
559000	561000	It was horrible.
561000	563000	I tried playing that too.
563000	566000	I downloaded it and played like about 10 minutes of it and got confused.
566000	570000	Because it's like, your car has like a tentacle that shoots lasers.
570000	578000	And you have to shoot like flying bird, box birds and toasters or something like that.
578000	581000	You said the best thing ever.
581000	584000	Tentacles that shoot lasers.
584000	586000	No, I know.
586000	588000	You would think this would be the perfect game, right?
588000	591000	A car with a tentacle that shoots laser beams at things.
591000	593000	How fucking rad is that?
593000	597000	Yet, somehow this game manages to fuck it up for free.
597000	602000	By the way, I will not be buying a Yaris because of this game.
602000	604000	I'm just telling you that much.
604000	607000	If I had thought about that, you know, see this is the thing now.
607000	611000	Every time someone thinks about Yaris, they're going to think, man, that sucked.
611000	615000	So, thank you, you have now associated suck with Yaris.
615000	618000	I thought they did that already.
618000	621000	They've just driven that home now.
621000	627000	Alright, so thumbs down on the Yaris game.
627000	631000	Yeah, it's not worth free.
631000	633000	It definitely is not worth free.
633000	635000	Yeah, I still want a Prius.
635000	638000	I want my time back.
638000	641000	Alright, my gaming week.
641000	644000	Folks, today, today was a good day.
644000	646000	You know why today was a good day?
646000	650000	I now have a level 70 druid in Warcraft.
650000	652000	I dinged 70 today.
652000	653000	Hold on, everybody.
653000	654000	I want my grats.
654000	655000	Here we go.
655000	657000	Ding.
657000	658000	Wait, where's my grats?
658000	659000	Ding.
659000	660000	Grats.
660000	661000	There you go.
661000	662000	Thank you.
662000	663000	God, you guys need training.
663000	664000	Alright.
664000	666000	And you're going to call yourselves WoW players.
666000	667000	I'm not a WoW player.
667000	669000	Fuck that shit.
669000	671000	These two are.
671000	677000	I was forced into exile from my dead PC and my butthead husband who won't build me a new one.
677000	683000	So you know what, I'm taking matters into my own hands and I'm playing Guild Wars.
683000	685000	Grats.
685000	686000	Alright.
686000	688000	So I hit.
688000	689000	Hey, that's not bad.
689000	691000	20s part way 70.
691000	692000	Alright, anyway.
692000	695000	So I did that.
695000	696000	Hooray.
696000	697000	I'm officially an addict.
697000	702000	And then I also played Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live with the tiniest text ever.
702000	706000	You can definitely tell this game is a port from another system, namely the DS.
706000	711000	And I don't know, for me, the mechanics of the game work a little well on the DS.
711000	716000	But it is kind of fun to be able to play the game humongous, the game itself, not the text,
716000	717000	on the TV.
717000	719000	Just kind of kick back, play on the TV.
719000	722000	And it does have the Xbox Live element, which is kind of cool.
722000	727000	But I do think the DS is a slightly better version if you're not going to be doing a
727000	729000	lot of the Xbox Live battling.
729000	732000	Just because you can read the text a little better, the interface works better when you
732000	736000	don't have to use the control pad to move to the block you want and then hit the button
736000	737000	to switch.
737000	740000	You can just use the stylus to swap the bricks.
740000	741000	It works a lot easier.
741000	744000	But otherwise, Puzzle Quest itself is a great game.
744000	748000	It took Bejeweled and made it like 100 times better by adding this whole competitive element
748000	749000	to it.
749000	750000	So I was very happy with that.
750000	755000	But one thing to the Xbox Live's credit, it costs about half as much as the DS version.
755000	759000	And for an arcade title, for an Xbox Live arcade title, especially considering it came
759000	763000	out the same week as Yaris, it's definitely one of the better things you can download
763000	764000	on Xbox Live Arcade.
764000	768000	So if you don't have a DS and you like puzzlers at all, I definitely recommend you check out
768000	769000	Puzzle Quest.
769000	773000	But if you have a DS, maybe it's worth it to pay the extra 10, 15 bucks so you can have
773000	776000	the game on the go and have the better controls.
776000	778000	So that's Puzzle Quest in a nutshell.
778000	781000	And then I also played the Yaris game and I was like, WTF.
781000	782000	LOL.
782000	783000	BBQ.
783000	784000	All right.
784000	785000	What else did you play, Chris?
785000	787000	I played Dungeons and Dragons.
787000	788000	Nerd.
788000	790000	And I converted nerd.
790000	792000	I attacked the darkness.
792000	794000	No, no, no.
794000	801000	I went to GeekCon in Madison, Wisconsin last week and they had a Dungeons and Dragons table
801000	806000	in the RPG room and it was said for beginners and I'm an experienced player, so I just wanted
806000	808000	to go in there for the gameplay and maybe help out.
808000	814000	The guy looked at me, like brought in my three core books, my like 75 characters, and he
814000	816000	looked so intimidated at me.
816000	819000	He's like, oh, you play.
819000	821000	I'm like, yeah.
821000	824000	This is the only D&D game in this entire convention.
824000	825000	Let's play.
825000	826000	No, he didn't know.
826000	827000	He was like, uh.
827000	828000	Let's rock it.
828000	831000	And he basically, there were so many people that showed up to that game.
831000	833000	He's like, all right, can you run a game?
833000	835000	I'm like, yeah.
835000	837000	And I ended up converting like three other people.
837000	838000	Cool.
838000	839000	Yeah, it was awesome.
839000	842000	D&D is kind of the roots of video gaming in a way.
842000	843000	I mean, modern RPGs.
843000	844000	Yeah, Meg Z's friends.
844000	849000	I'm teaching them how to play, and they all have played all the RPGs, Final Fantasy, World
849000	851000	of Warcraft, so they're really good at it.
851000	853000	But you're still a hardcore nerd for being into that.
853000	855000	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
855000	856000	Damn.
856000	857000	All right.
857000	858000	Going to our chat room.
858000	859000	See that webcam?
859000	860000	Damn right.
860000	861000	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
861000	862000	Look at that dice right here.
862000	864000	This is where our chatters always are.
864000	868000	We're going to start off tonight with NM64 says, Skye, if the text, speaking of Puzzle
868000	872000	Quest, is a port of a DS version, how can the text be small?
872000	875000	Wouldn't it be like five times bigger along with the rest of the screen?
875000	879000	That's what you'd think, but for whatever reason they, you know, certainly they upscaled
879000	880000	the graphics.
880000	881800	You're not going to look at like pixelated stuff, okay?
881800	882940	It is HD graphics.
882940	885400	The game looks very nice and has a good art style.
885400	889880	But for whatever reason, they brought in text the size of the DS resolution.
889880	890880	I have no idea.
890880	896180	I would think that it would be a port of the PSP version since it's in a similar aspect
896180	897180	ratio.
897180	898180	Perhaps it is.
898180	899180	I don't know.
899180	900840	I haven't played the PSP version, so it's hard for me to say.
900840	902440	But that would make sense.
902440	906680	But I hope the text in the PSP version isn't that small because you need frickin', it was
906680	907760	like a monocle to read it.
907760	908760	I don't know.
908760	909760	A magnifying glass.
909760	910760	Crazy.
910760	911760	Fucking monocle.
911760	912760	That's right.
912760	913760	You need a fucking monocle.
913760	914760	All right.
914760	915760	The NDA 4.0 is going to suck.
915760	916760	Why?
916760	917760	I heard they're making it like Warcraft.
917760	918760	It is.
918760	919760	And you know what the problem is?
919760	920760	It's worse.
920760	924800	Because instead of them like running around and doing stuff, it's little figures that
924800	928760	you have on the mat and they just move forward.
928760	933660	Are Chinese people going to be farming for gold in D&D 4.0 as well?
933660	934660	No idea.
934660	935660	All right.
935660	939320	Well, those little figurines were cool when they were on their own separate game because
939320	942080	they had those D&D figurines for a few years now.
942080	944800	I used to collect them for my roommates.
944800	946320	Is that like Warhammer?
946320	947320	I am a nerd.
947320	949960	Are those like Warhammer things?
949960	950960	Kind of.
950960	951960	But like the little figures?
951960	954640	And you used the hex charts to move them around and all that crap?
954640	957240	Well, it wasn't a hex chart, it was just little squares.
957240	958240	Squares.
958240	960520	You know, you had little characters.
960520	965560	The guy who runs our game actually uses...
965560	970920	The guy who runs the game that I'm in actually uses a hex map and little figurines.
970920	971920	Fuck that.
971920	973320	It's, you know, it's fuck the hex maps.
973320	977720	It's all about if they survive the fall down the stairs, they win.
977720	981760	That is, just flick those little things off the stairs and they fly and...
981760	983800	Well, I have a suggestion.
983800	987600	How about we move off of D&D?
987600	990760	No disrespect, but we do want to move on with the show, because thanks to all our audio
990760	995320	problems that you didn't hear tonight, if you weren't listening live, we're now 40 minutes
995320	997360	into our program tonight and no news yet.
997360	999680	So really quick, some housekeeping.
999680	1004400	You can view a live webcam of our show in progress or an archived webcam of our show
1004400	1006080	over operator11.com.
1006080	1009880	You can see our smiling faces all looking at you, waving hello, and doing this program.
1009880	1011320	So operator11.com.
1011320	1016600	Also join our live journal and our MySpace, and if you swing this way, you can join our
1016600	1018120	Facebook communities, too.
1018120	1022640	We have a presence on all those sites, and we love having folks in our communities.
1022640	1026840	Also tonight's program, bringing back the interviews with the folks out there who make
1026840	1027840	the games.
1027840	1031200	A lot of you guys have given us feedback that you want to hear more interviews, and so we're
1031200	1035360	very happy tonight to have some representation from Bizarre Creations tonight.
1035360	1037320	We're going to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxies.
1037320	1042140	We'll get to that in Part B. For now, though, let's get into the gaming news.
1042140	1046960	So anyways, big news this week about Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
1046960	1047960	It's delayed.
1047960	1051720	Ha ha, no Smash Brothers for Christmas, Timmy.
1051720	1060000	Anyways, it's going to be coming out now in February on the 10th, and other news, Sonic
1060000	1061000	the Hedgehog's in there.
1061000	1063840	Oh my God, that's like such a surprise.
1063840	1068360	Like who would have thought that Sonic the Hedgehog would be on a Wii game?
1068360	1069360	Really?
1069360	1070760	Who would have thought?
1070760	1076600	I mean, you know, it's not like that they have, I don't know, Mario and Sonic at the
1076600	1078600	Olympics and shit like that.
1078600	1079960	But anyways, Sonic is in there.
1079960	1083080	It's pretty cool.
1083080	1084320	What more can I say?
1084320	1085920	Although I am not surprised.
1085920	1091680	In fact, this will be, I'm guessing, the first of many delays to come.
1091680	1096280	In fact, we had heard, straight from Nintendo, Nintendo recently announced that there will
1096280	1103280	be an additional 30 days added to most 4th quarter Wii releases due to production issues.
1103280	1107400	So you'll probably see a lot of Wii titles slipping by 30 days or so.
1107400	1110360	Uh oh, where is this coming from?
1110360	1111360	Nintendo?
1111360	1114600	Oh, okay, sorry.
1114600	1118680	So okay, so they go and they announce that Sonic is going to actually be in the game,
1118680	1120520	which is like to no one's surprise, right?
1120520	1124800	We all figured, okay, they said there were going to be other third party stuff in the
1124800	1128840	game and so it's no surprise that Sonic is one of them, right?
1128840	1130080	So what do you guys think?
1130080	1134200	If that earlier quote is true that there are three third party characters that are going
1134200	1136980	to show up in the game, who do you think the third is going to be?
1136980	1137980	If it's true.
1137980	1138980	I think at this point, actually, it's not true.
1138980	1142160	I think Sonic's all you're going to get, but what would you think?
1142160	1143160	Mega Man?
1143160	1144160	Mega Man?
1144160	1145160	Anybody?
1145160	1146160	Anybody?
1146160	1147160	Anybody else think?
1147160	1148160	Who's not in there?
1148160	1149160	Or who's already in there?
1149160	1153600	Third party is only Snake and Sonic, meaning not Nintendo themselves.
1153600	1159160	If they kept on the Sega route, I would actually put Knuckles in it.
1159160	1164260	I would say to make, because now everybody's going like OMG Mario vs. Sonic, I would say
1164260	1169820	to make the console wars of yesteryear complete, Bonk needs to be the third party character
1169820	1170820	in the game.
1170820	1171820	But we'll see.
1171820	1172820	Sora.
1172820	1176560	So they're like, okay, hooray, we're going to have Sonic in the game.
1176560	1181840	Oh, and by the way, we're going to release this game next year on February 10th.
1181840	1197280	They just ran out of days to tease characters in the Smash dojo, so they're like, fuck,
1197280	1198280	we need some more time.
1198280	1199800	Let's just push the game back.
1199800	1209000	I think I like Cycoon's suggestion of Bomberman, because Bomberman was also one of the NEC,
1209000	1212120	you know, Hudson main people.
1212120	1214640	Dr. Tetsuya says Pyramid Head.
1214640	1217080	That would be awesome, but not going to happen.
1217080	1218080	I'm sorry.
1218080	1219080	I nominate Sora or Ash.
1219080	1226960	I can see them doing Bomberman since they've already had Bomberman Dream Mix TV, so that
1226960	1230120	pretty much had Snake as well.
1230120	1231120	Why not?
1231120	1235440	Yeah, but they can just rip all the fucking moves from that and just throw it in here,
1235440	1239440	I mean, shit, essentially it was a rip-off of Smash Bros. anyways.
1239440	1243400	All right, well, if you want to be cooler than all your friends and play Super Smash
1243400	1250840	Bros. Brawl first, you've got to go to E4ALL, which is being held in LA next week, starting
1250840	1253000	on October 18th at the LA Convention Center.
1253000	1257740	Of course, this is the little band-aid, because there was no real E3.
1257740	1260080	There was many E3s earlier this year.
1260080	1263960	So this is their throw to try and kind of fill that void.
1263960	1266120	And of course, Sony and Microsoft are not going to be there.
1266120	1269240	However, Nintendo is, and Nintendo said, we're going to be there and we're showing off all
1269240	1270240	of these games.
1270240	1274200	We're showing off Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Donkey Kong Barrel Blast,
1274200	1279960	Battalion Wars 2, Fire Emblem, Wii Zapper, Crossbow Training, Mario Song at the Olympics,
1279960	1286600	Guitar Hero 3, Rayman Raving Rabbids 2, Resident Evil Umbrella, Ella Ella AAA, Chronicles,
1286600	1291760	Medal of Honor Heroes 2, Ghost Squad, and on the DS, there's a lot of stuff.
1291760	1295000	Pokemon, Diamond and Pearl, wait, didn't that come out?
1295000	1296600	Brain Age, wait, didn't that come out?
1296600	1299000	Brain Age 2, wait, that came out too.
1299000	1301080	Zelda Found an Hourglass, actually, that came out.
1301080	1303200	Nintendogs, you know, that came out too.
1303200	1306320	Mario Kart, you know, a lot of these games they're showing actually have already come
1306320	1308320	out, I'm noticing.
1308320	1310880	They're new.
1310880	1312920	If they're not new, they're new to you.
1312920	1317720	But hey, if you want to play them like they're new again, head on over to E4ALL.
1317720	1321560	Hey, Final Fantasy XII is going to be there, that little spin-off game on the DS.
1321560	1323440	So there's some new stuff.
1323440	1326220	They may not be new, but you'll think they are.
1326220	1328320	They're going to try to fool you.
1328320	1334200	Well, what is not new, and actually this does not completely surprise me at all, is that
1334200	1338100	the Wii is not lowering price at all.
1338100	1341960	It will stay at $249.
1341960	1346720	And that's because the folks at Nintendo are saying that they're selling them as they make
1346720	1347720	them.
1347720	1352200	So they're having absolutely no trouble and seeing no point in lowering the price.
1352200	1356980	On top of that, I mean, honestly, $249 is not bad for a system.
1356980	1360760	So basically Nintendo's saying, you know, well, you guys are still buying them, so what
1360760	1361760	do we need to do any different?
1361760	1364520	In fact, we're going to increase the price.
1364520	1365520	You know.
1365520	1366520	Sucka!
1366520	1367520	They could.
1367520	1370560	The direct quote, I think it's funny that this guy's name is George Harrison.
1370560	1377520	But anyway, who is one of the Nintendo reps, said that we'll stay at $249 for the first
1377520	1378920	sale of the future.
1378920	1382340	We are still selling everything we can make.
1382340	1384160	So hey, you're making money.
1384160	1385280	You're still selling them.
1385280	1386280	What the hell?
1386280	1387280	I know one thing.
1387280	1390320	I thought George Harrison was leaving Nintendo and going back to being a dead beetle.
1390320	1391320	What?
1391320	1395260	I heard, no, I heard, I seriously heard he was leaving Nintendo.
1395260	1397560	So what, what's going on with it?
1397560	1398800	It's a bad, okay.
1398800	1399800	That's the bad joke.
1399800	1406160	Anyway, look, I was going to say that, um, there, this didn't make the show roll, but
1406160	1412640	there was conspiracy theories going around that they're, um, one, that they're either,
1412640	1417040	you know, lowering production so that they're still a shortage going through the holidays
1417040	1423440	to increase demand on the Wii, um, or because this is also kind of being shown in their
1423440	1427880	marketing campaign or that they're just making the best of a bad situation.
1427880	1431880	Because if you notice, their new set of commercials now, the very first thing that starts off
1431880	1436000	as a, we got one, like it's a big thing, like we got one.
1436000	1441720	And now, no, you know, we stood up, we started playing, we had fun, you know, we bonded,
1441720	1442720	all this shit.
1442720	1444280	But the whole thing is like, we got one.
1444280	1445680	Oh my God, celebration.
1445680	1447900	See, that's the, that's the fucking thing.
1447900	1448900	That's what they're doing.
1448900	1451300	They're trying to market off of, you know, the shortage thing.
1451300	1456040	So whether it's intentional or not, they're using it, you know, to their advantage.
1456040	1460200	And you know what, they probably don't need to anyways, but it's probably a good marketing
1460200	1463720	campaign because it's just going to increase hype and really that's all that they care
1463720	1472280	about, although, although there is a part in there that is a little disturbing with
1472280	1473840	the mother and son.
1473840	1477880	They're playing some game or something and she's like holding his hand.
1477880	1484480	It's like, um, was it, uh, we came together or something like, like, oh no,
1484480	1491040	God, only you people can think that, is that the one that at the very end, the Japanese
1491040	1494760	guys like can do the controller.
1494760	1503720	It was really funny when I was, when I was in Wisconsin, um, Megzi's mother was entertaining
1503720	1508720	some Japanese guests and they looked at, and she's got a Wii and they were looking at it
1508720	1511480	and you know, Megzi was like, oh yeah, it's a Wii.
1511480	1514840	And he's like, we've never seen one.
1514840	1520040	We they were from Chiba, so we actually have the chat room reaction to Loki's little comment
1520040	1523840	on Wii came together.
1523840	1536400	Wait, wait to have that clip queued up.
1536400	1545400	I didn't realize it was going to be like 15 seconds into it.
1545400	1550960	That's why we don't have a soundboard on the program folks anyways.
1550960	1557440	In other news and more to get you up on your feet, Wii Fit's coming out to, um, Japan on
1557440	1560400	December 1st for 8,800 yen.
1560400	1562920	And of course I'll feature the Wii balance board.
1562920	1566080	That's approximately $75 US.
1566080	1570320	And um, yeah, no idea when it's coming out in the US though.
1570320	1575700	So you'll have to wait your fat asses until, you know, it comes out.
1575700	1578840	Actually those boards supposedly only hold up to like 300 pounds.
1578840	1582040	So if you're like, you know, one of those people on the Maury Povich show, uh, you may
1582040	1587080	not even get to play this game at all, two boards.
1587080	1588320	One for each hoof.
1588320	1591880	Wait now how, how many yen was that?
1591880	1592880	It was 8,800.
1592880	1593880	8,800 yen.
1593880	1597900	Now, if you're having difficulty, imagine how much money 8,800 yen is.
1597900	1602600	Imagine 1 yen 8,800 times.
1602600	1604920	It's not over 9,000 though, so that's good.
1604920	1607440	It's like 85 bucks.
1607440	1608440	Alright.
1608440	1614440	However, what's coming out right now is the 3.1 update for the Wii.
1614440	1618080	It's going to have USB keyboard support for everything.
1618080	1622060	Because remember before, the Wii update only had the limited USB support.
1622060	1623800	And how long did it take them to do this shit?
1623800	1627820	Come on, seriously, this should have been in there from the get-go?
1627820	1633180	And also with the new Wii update, a brand new enhanced everybody votes channel.
1633180	1636360	And did they make the everybody votes channel interesting again?
1636360	1640320	Sadly, no, they just added the USB keyboard support to the everybody votes channel.
1640320	1645040	So if you're actually still voting, of which I can't imagine there's that many people still
1645040	1649320	voting, but if you are, then, uh, well, you get a new enhanced version and you can submit
1649320	1653480	your questions now using the keyboard so you can annoy Nintendo even faster with your questions
1653480	1655680	like what's better, cake or pie?
1655680	1658840	Cake or death?
1658840	1660240	What's a better way to die?
1660240	1661240	Fire?
1661240	1662240	Boat fire?
1662240	1663300	You know?
1663300	1667960	And I encourage people to send their dumb questions to Nintendo because it's funny.
1667960	1669960	It's really funny.
1669960	1671520	Funny!
1671520	1675840	Funny haha or funny oh fuck.
1675840	1681880	Well for our friends in the UK, we have a few updates to Virtual Console.
1681880	1692200	You have Super Metroid, dun dun dun, and it is 800 points, uh, uh, 560 or 8 euro.
1692200	1693200	What?
1693200	1696840	Okay, Rob's giving me this look, I'm like what?
1696840	1702480	So yeah, go play Super Metroid, all of you, now!
1702480	1708080	And then you also get, um, those on the NES, you get Protector Bot 2, Return of the Evil
1708080	1721800	Forces, known to us as Super Contra, because, Contra came out over there as Protector Bot.
1721800	1723960	I think it had different sprites too.
1723960	1728480	Dude, Contra is just awesome, so whatever.
1728480	1729480	With blood.
1729480	1734680	Um, going to the chat, I was giggling because NintendoManiac64 says, the best everybody
1734680	1739160	votes channel question, what's better, the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3?
1739160	1744720	Uh, let's see, SSA100Matt thinks the Miis will be the last unlockable character in Super
1744720	1749760	Smash Bros. Brawl, uh, VXJsonXV says the everybody votes channel rules!
1749760	1755200	I vote every day, says our loyal webmaster, VXJsonXV, so I just made fun of the guy that
1755200	1758240	hosts our website for nothing, good job Rob.
1758240	1761840	I thought, I thought Jason had more of a life than that.
1761840	1763200	You know what, he's just very democratic.
1763200	1764600	He wants his voice to be known.
1764600	1768140	He wants people to know who he thinks should win American Idol.
1768140	1771320	He wants people to know what color is better.
1771320	1773800	What other kinds of dumbass things did they ask on there?
1773800	1780520	He wants people to know that he prefers winter over summer, and all that crap, alright.
1780520	1784640	And uh, Jason Ochs commented, gotta love this like, puppies should die in a boat fire.
1784640	1787720	I like puppies!
1787720	1791580	Well, boat fire is okay, at least there's water.
1791580	1798640	So finally, it seems that Nintendo's going to be turning around this whole lack of stuff
1798640	1805040	for Wii Online, including, of course they talked about the WiiWare service, and they
1805040	1808120	made some announcements of new titles that are going to be coming out for the WiiWare
1808120	1821560	service, including Pokemon Farm, uh, a Crystal Chronicles game called The Young King and
1821560	1828440	The Promised Land, where you build your own country, and let's see here, also Star Soldier
1828440	1834440	R, and Dr. Mario Wii, that's also going to be coming out as well.
1834440	1838740	Of course, no dates yet as far as when we're going to see them in the US, or pretty much
1838740	1841840	anywhere on Earth.
1841840	1843520	Imagine next year at some point.
1843520	1848400	Other games announced as well, um, there was Mina de Puzloop, which came out over here
1848400	1855760	as Magnetica, it's a rip-off of Zuma, and um, then also of course, there was a game
1855760	1863400	called Maruboushikaku, and that's um, some weird thing that involves screens displaying
1863400	1867640	uh, different patterns, circle, line, and square based, and no idea what the fuck that
1867640	1868640	is.
1868640	1876160	Ah, anyways, and of course, those are only um, kind of um, a little um, sampling of what's
1876160	1880600	going to be coming, Nintendo says that there is going to be over a hundred WiiWare games
1880600	1886160	that have been proposed to them, and who knows, we'll see some good original content coming
1886160	1887160	in 2008.
1887160	1893120	Um, I was going to say, there was one other thing too that they um, showed off there,
1893120	1898640	um, real quick, one of which of course was that um, was it the Wii Contest channel or
1898640	1904320	something like that, the you know, Me Is Your Me Hot or Not type shit, that was being shown
1904320	1905320	on there.
1905320	1909920	Also, there's going to be a DS um, download channel as well, but it's actually going to
1909920	1914280	be called like, I believe the Nintendo channel, where you can download DS demos to stream
1914280	1920240	to your um, DS of course over the Wii, um, using the download play, and also they're
1920240	1926020	going to have videos and possibly later on, Wii game demos, so, fuck yeah, it's about
1926020	1928020	fucking time.
1928020	1933920	And uh, yeah I know, when they asked Nintendo how many WiiWare games would be available
1933920	1938840	next year, they said, OVER NINE THOUSAND!
1938840	1940880	I mean seriously, a hundred, that's a lot.
1940880	1945880	Um, let's see, uh, Color of Sakura in our chatroom says uh, maybe the channel should
1945880	1950240	be called My Pokemans, Let Me Show You Them, the My Pokemans, Let Me Show You Them channel.
1950240	1952240	I hear you like mudkips.
1952240	1957200	Yes, and we should understand that you have a mudkip, I don't like to trade your mudkip
1957200	1958200	from my pillup.
1958200	1965000	And that pillup turns into a big buttfucker penguin, but that pillup turns into a big
1965000	1968440	buttfucker penguin, to quote my girlfriend.
1968440	1973440	Anyhow, so WiiWare, lots of stuff coming out for the WiiWare.
1973440	1975440	Also another game coming out, Wii Music.
1975440	1980520	Now a lot of us saw this game at the very first time we saw the Wii at E3 2006, remember
1980520	1983780	that was, you know, remember when uh, I think it was Miyamoto came out on stage, he's conducting
1983780	1985920	the orchestra, da da da, what?
1985920	1991480	Uh, no, that was Miyamoto on the thing, but I saw um, Koji Kondo playing a guy's autograph.
1991480	1995440	Yeah, I mean, and throughout the show they had like the guy's drumming or whatever, well,
1995440	1999520	now it actually is going to be this fleshed out music title, it's called Wii Music, and
1999520	2003120	uh, actually they've released some screenshots, you can see here, here's a bunch of Miis playing
2003120	2006600	a variety of instruments like a xylophone, a guitar, a trumpet, all kind of standing
2006600	2007600	out in a field.
2007600	2012360	Um, so even though it was kind of a tech demo now, now there's this whole new, you know,
2012360	2013880	version of the concept.
2013880	2017360	Basically what you're going to be able to do, you can control up to six band members
2017360	2020280	and use both motions and button presses.
2020280	2024180	There's forty different types of instruments in the game and you can pretty much mix and
2024180	2025180	match your band.
2025180	2028980	Uh, supposedly the game's going to have a variety of different music styles and multiplayer
2028980	2031560	mode featuring four players.
2031560	2041280	I want a band that has a zither, a harmonica, a melodica, um, an autoharp, and uh, one snare
2041280	2042720	drum.
2042720	2049400	I would like Nintendo to know that if this game does not have a didgeridoo, it sucks.
2049400	2053360	Seriously, like, you better fuckin' have a didgeridoo in this game, because I want
2053360	2055360	Nothing to do with it if I cannot have my
2059000	2062120	And and and a flugelhorn
2064680	2066680	Anyway
2071160	2076340	It has to have a cowbell so we need a band that with a didgeridoo a zither a
2076340	2081940	a cowbell a flugelhorn a sitar
2084060	2088340	And a harmonica and this is why we don't let you guys make music
2089220	2094300	Hey, I can play saxophone and clarinet. Hey, thanks to thanks to Mac
2094300	2097940	I am a certified musician with my garage band and iMovies
2097940	2107780	Oh, they caught that on camera too crap. Hey, I have a story son of dad would like there to be a skin flute in the game that you can play
2108580	2112180	Dude, you don't need a video round of human screams. Is that an instrument?
2112180	2118900	No, no, no, no, no, no if you need a game for that then you need to do if there's there's simple steps
2120300	2122100	Stand up
2122100	2126820	Go to your door open it walk out close the closing the doors optional
2126820	2131900	Go through the appropriate hallway to get to your front door open it step out leave
2133140	2136180	experience nature real life
2137940	2139940	Get laid I
2141020	2145220	Highly recommend. Okay this coming from the bitch who wants a sitar and we music
2146740	2150860	Well an electric sitar cuz the tars are sexy anyway
2152300	2154300	That's explicit on chat
2154300	2158940	You know, we've we were explicit from the moment. You said surprise butt sex. I
2161700	2164820	Think I make the explicit so shall I continue
2165860	2170740	For anyone who's looking forward to the new Mario Kart and you are going to be able to play up to
2171180	2178220	12 players online on Mario Kart Wii which will officially make it the biggest Mario Kart of ours
2178220	2185780	As long as you do it, right and as long as there's not two people on the car at the same time because that
2185980	2188700	That's just gonna be bad memories. I don't want to revisit
2190460	2192460	And also there's like
2193160	2199060	So now it's like project Gotham four. Yeah. Okay. I tried playing the motorbikes and project Gotham for not pretty
2199060	2204580	I'm really bad at project Gotham racing and like watching me race the motorbike
2204580	2210060	In project Gotham four it was like watching me learn how to ride a bike for the first time was I only left
2211060	2216940	Right and then I fall off and collapse in a big heap and my bike falls on top of me to add insult to injury
2217060	2219780	Thank You project Gotham for making me feel like a bad driver
2221260	2223260	But yeah, there will be bikes
2223860	2225500	which it's like
2225500	2232180	Why the fuck do you need bikes? I mean the game was fine as Mario Kart. It's not Mario Kart and stuff. I mean seriously
2232180	2233460	um
2233460	2236440	Anyways, so Mario and Sonic at the Olympics
2236440	2239660	They've already announced a bunch of really cool characters that you can play as but fuck that
2239660	2244980	Let's play as myself because you can play as your own me in the game because you know
2244980	2249560	Hey, fuck all the time that you know takes to actually put these wonderful characters in the game
2249580	2253620	Let's just have some dick put his own stupid me in there and play as himself
2254940	2256220	Hooray
2256220	2260340	Fuck that ain't buying the game. Anyways, it's the fucking Olympics. You're gonna trick me this time
2260340	2268340	Hey, I like this idea because now like we can find out who's better me or Mario me who's faster me or Sonic me. I
2269140	2274460	Can now prove that I'm the best thing ever with my me, right?
2276940	2278940	It's all about me yeah, that's all about me
2280500	2288040	Anyhow, if you're you know one game that I'm glad my me cannot be put into is a resin evil umbrella chronicles
2288040	2290720	Because I would not want to die in this game
2290840	2294240	Get shot or what have you or get my brains eaten by zombies
2294400	2299620	But what you can get with the resin evil umbrella chronicles is the Wii Zapper. That's right
2299620	2302340	There's actually going to be a Wii Zapper combo
2302940	2306760	Coming out and although right now it looks like it's only coming out in Japan
2306760	2311040	You never know if you cross your fingers hold your breath. It might come out over here on states
2311040	2315860	I'm not gonna happen. Why is that because it's not gonna happen. It's Japan gets all the cool shit
2315860	2319760	All right. Well, they also get with this cool shit called the expert package a
2320400	2325040	28-page book called Wesker's extra report and they also get stickers
2326760	2328760	Because who doesn't love stickers
2329320	2331320	Well, I love this in zombie pew pew
2332440	2340240	Anyway, well one thing though about the special editions is that when we got one biohazard code Veronica came out over here
2340240	2346800	Well, we didn't get the big briefcase that had the Wesker's files and everything and Dan and I were tempted to order it
2347040	2350100	however, what they did after the fact was
2351200	2358280	Release the Wesker report as a special disk like a free giveaway and I got like a bunch of them
2358560	2365220	But you know, I think that we're gonna get the stuff. It's just not gonna be in the cool ass bundle. So
2366080	2368080	anyway
2368080	2371000	something that is happy a face is
2372440	2374440	It's it's O face anyway
2375000	2376840	is if you
2376840	2383520	get contra for you are getting contra not just that you're getting contra super C and

2393120	2399200	I'm just entertaining our op 11 people before they get cut off, but I'm listening
2401560	2407240	The op 11 feed limits us to 40 minutes a recording so anyway, so
2408760	2410760	So you get
2411440	2413300	Stop it
2413300	2415120	so you get

2479040	2484040	Victoria's boxers. So if you're looking for like an anime Mike Tyson's punch-out, maybe
2486840	2490640	It sounds like Victoria's secret is that she actually wears boxers

2619400	2627720	What it's it's a wonderful game it's like jam sessions except well you can I don't know
2627720	2629720	I
2632560	2634560	See it like on CNN like four times
2635960	2639440	Concert tickets are getting sold by scalpers real quick though
2639440	2645180	And one other thing on the PC heroes of might and magic five tribes of the East that expansions finally coming out as well
2645640	2652160	So that is pretty much everything. Well, then let's go to Japan and see what our friends overseas are getting this week
2652280	2656120	They are also getting a game. You may have heard of on this program
2656120	2658240	Before we had to get rid of it
2658240	2665480	Beautiful Katamari Damacy ships in Japan on October 18th on the Xbox 360 another game coming out on the Xbox 360
2666040	2672200	Zoids alternative not zoinks but Zoids alternative and it kind of looks like a cyborg type game
2672200	2676400	But what I find very interesting is that the box art totally has Final Fantasy font
2676560	2681040	But yeah, it has like it totally looks like a Final Fantasy game yet
2681040	2688700	It's nothing to do with Final Fantasy Zoids is like it's a Takara game and Takara is responsible for transformers over there
2688700	2693700	Zoids is like a I don't know. I call it a ripoff of like fucking I
2694300	2695780	don't know like
2695780	2698200	Mighty Morphin Power Rangers or maybe even like
2701500	2705180	Exactly and I'd say maybe even also ripoff of Voltron a little bit
2705180	2711460	Which is also Japanese. Power Rangers destroyed my childhood. Hitstun in our chat room would like to remind us
2711460	2714140	They've been making Zoids games since the NES.
2715060	2720620	I would also like to point out with all the ripping off thing and Rob bringing up the Final Fantasy font that it was Yoshitaka
2720620	2725940	Amano who was in part responsible for us having the whole transforming team whatever mecha
2726660	2730460	Genre to begin with so he's responsible for the rape of my childhood
2730460	2736300	He did the character he did the character designs for a kagaki ninja taigachiman. I don't care what anyone says Trini was hot
2737660	2742420	Also hot is Tobey Maguire starring in spider-man 3 coming out on the PlayStation 3
2743820	2751240	See how I took it right back on track. I like the Japanese. Yes. Well because it's the Japanese version
2751240	2757540	That's why the box says Japanese writing go figure coming out. It's interesting. I don't see that every day PlayStation 3
2757540	2764420	I don't panic see man to notice that is a see man not
2764980	2766980	The other thing okay
2768260	2774240	No no no no Dan, and I sat around with our dreamcast talking to our C man for how long
2774240	2784920	How often do you talk to Dan C man Dan was the one who taught to our C man
2787200	2789520	And then they turned into in demand frogs
2792960	2794960	Make it stop Wow
2795400	2800320	Which that sound you hear is millions of listeners across America throwing up into their mouths
2800320	2804320	There you go all
2806120	2813040	Right well sure you do you know you can import this into America the bundle for C man to for the PlayStation 2
2813120	2818160	The full title C man to pay King Genjin. He could see kit is coming out this week
2818160	2821940	It's gonna cost you 90 bucks if you want to import that sucker, but that comes with a microphone
2821940	2826680	So you can you know yell at your C man? What is it? I'm sorry. I've never played that
2826680	2832120	C man first of all when it came out over here. It was narrated by Leonard Nimoy, and that was really cool
2832120	2834240	Um you you start off with these
2834880	2839600	These eggs, and you grow them into tadpoles, and they eventually grow human faces and you
2845280	2851920	Isn't that kind of like the other kind of C man does that to allow me to continue I grant the permission
2851920	2860760	And so I'm gonna take the mic away from Rob see I like having two mics now cuz he can tell Rob to SDF you
2862880	2869000	Anyway, so um they speak this own little like nonsense language, and you talk to them and
2869800	2874240	Eventually they start talking back and they build their vocabulary as you talk to them
2874240	2877900	And then they start speaking in this distinguished sort of posh British accent
2878960	2879960	and
2879960	2887040	then decide and then that you have conversations with them, and they ask you questions, and then they remember the things that you've answered and
2887720	2890880	You you know they ask you your birthday, and you speak back and forth to them
2890880	2897840	And you monitor their habitat make sure the water is right feed them every day, but eventually they start eating each other
2902640	2905080	Fantastic or like one will die or something
2905080	2910080	Okay, so it's like Pokemon in the Sims combined, but you talk to them
2912720	2913720	No
2913720	2916760	They they have every this program in that is very interesting
2916760	2919880	How is this game not shown up on my radar in the years?
2919880	2923700	So we've been doing orange lounge radio five and a half years, and I've never heard of this game
2923700	2927880	What the hell do you want to borrow mine? I think so. Do you have a working VMU I?
2928720	2932920	Actually, I do okay. I still have my child. I have the Dreamcast hooked up in the garage
2932920	2934920	I can play C man all night long
2935600	2937600	at any rate as
2938280	2941300	As you as you progress through the game you have another tank
2941300	2942200	That's a terrarium
2942200	2949620	So you're actually growing another environment and after a while your C man's gonna start floundering around and start turning into a cocoon
2949620	2958620	And
2958620	2965180	Then and then you you eventually move the cocoon into the terrarium and it hatches into a frog man
2965180	2968180	And then he leaves and the game is over
2970580	2976200	See and then in a sequel game you actually your your guy turns into a caveman and so
2976200	2979920	So, thus the cycle starts all over again.
2979920	2980920	Think about it.
2980920	2985800	So he turns into a caveman so he can do Geico commercials.
2985800	2989200	There's a series about that now.
2989200	2990200	Like an actual TV series.
2990200	2993560	And they stole that from Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer on Saturday Night Live.
2993560	2995800	Why did you all have to remind us about that show?
2995800	2998080	I mean, just when I purged it from my memory.
2998080	2999080	So, my turn, right?
2999080	3000080	Or do you have more stuff?
3000080	3001760	No, I have more stuff, actually.
3001760	3005400	We got sidetracked by C-Man, but the sequel to C-Man is coming out on the PlayStation
3005400	3006400	video.
3006400	3007400	Okay.
3007400	3010200	Galaxy Angel 2 Mugen Kairou no Kage is coming out.
3010200	3013360	I have no idea what the hell this game is, but you know it's cool because it's by a company
3013360	3015880	called Broccoli.
3015880	3017840	Broccoli did Digicarrot.
3017840	3019880	Ah, very cool.
3019880	3020880	Well there you go.
3020880	3023840	So, from the people who brought you Digicarrot.
3023840	3031340	So Sonic Rush Adventure is coming out on the Nintendo DS from Sega and also in Japan this
3031340	3038180	week on the PSP Riviera Yasuko No Chi Special Edition is coming out.
3038180	3041040	And it looks like another game based off an anime, surprise surprise.
3041040	3042240	That's it.
3042240	3043780	My turn.
3043780	3045960	And coming out over in the UK.
3045960	3051120	On the 16th, Warmonger Operation Downtown Destruction, 17th Speedball 2 Brutal Deluxe.
3051120	3053920	Everything else is coming out on the 19th.
3053920	3059180	Eternal Sonata for Xbox 360 Football Manager 2008, which by the way is real football and
3059180	3061560	not the shit we have in America.
3061560	3067480	Galactic Assault Half Life 2 Episode 2, King of Clubs, Lair, Life Science Hospital Affairs
3067480	3073880	Luminous Arc, Myst, Naruto Ultimate Ninja, Naruto Ultimate Ninja 2, like they get the
3073880	3078240	game and then they get the sequel the same day, why?
3078240	3084360	Portal on Xbox 360, Pursuit Force Extreme Justice, Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis.
3084360	3089760	Didn't that already come out?
3089760	3090960	They're just getting Portal.
3090960	3095160	I would just buy Portal and skip Half Life altogether.
3095160	3101520	Also Tabula Rasa on PC, Team Fortress 2, The Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass, The Orange
3101520	3106360	Box on Xbox 360, why did they get an option of getting Portal?
3106360	3107520	I don't know.
3107520	3109860	I think it might be a typo.
3109860	3112720	You can buy it standalone here but only on PC.
3112720	3117960	You can get it through Steam, bastards.
3117960	3122160	Thrillville Off the Rails also coming out on damn near everything else.
3122160	3127960	Oh yeah, I forgot Thrillville Off the Rails is also coming out in the US.
3127960	3130760	It's fun, you get to make people hurl.
3130760	3135920	Anyways, something else that's coming out here pretty soon and fortunately is the last
3135920	3142800	in the long line of download content for Oblivion is the brand new Fighter's Stronghold.
3142800	3152040	It is the same price as a Yaris Xbox Live Arcade game but way better and will be coming
3152040	3153040	out.
3153040	3161080	It's actually going to be free beginning on October 15th but it's only free for a week.
3161080	3162080	Make sure you download it.
3162080	3167040	It's the last bit of download content you're going to see for Oblivion so what a way to
3167040	3170960	close it off for free.
3170960	3171960	Here you go.
3171960	3175520	This show actually will go to its podcast form on the 15th which is the way most people
3175520	3177880	listen to the program so go check Xbox Live.
3177880	3178880	It should be up now.
3178880	3181040	Friendly reminder from the folks here at OLR.
3181040	3186120	Also the other thing, here's some of the cool features though that the Fighter's Stronghold
3186120	3187400	comes with.
3187400	3194600	You can get your own vinter to create your own wines for you.
3194600	3201960	You have a combat trainer, a taxidermist to create trophies for your pad.
3201960	3203960	I think there is some other stuff.
3203960	3209280	Basically you get this whole castle to run after you do a little quest to get so fucking
3209280	3210280	awesome.
3210280	3214920	That would be so cool to just fill my castle with a bunch of dead bears.
3214920	3217840	Seriously, how is Elder Scrolls V going to top Oblivion?
3217840	3220200	I don't know.
3220200	3224320	This is literally saying, look, we're going to give you the kitchen sink in this game.
3224320	3225320	It's everything.
3225320	3226320	It's amazing.
3226320	3227320	It is amazing.
3227320	3229840	I have all my cat on my wall.
3229840	3230840	It's a video game, Chris.
3230840	3232840	You don't actually have to have real pets on your wall.
3232840	3237640	I know, but it's only fun to kill the sim pets.
3237640	3238640	But still.
3238640	3239640	You're so difficult to please.
3239640	3245920	As a sim, you can't throw fireballs at things.
3245920	3249480	I'll tell you what, Chris, there's nothing funner in Oblivion than throwing fireballs
3249480	3254280	at the sheep constantly, and then they start to attack you.
3254280	3256600	They figure out you're a bad man.
3256600	3257920	If they live long enough.
3257920	3260800	That is awesome.
3260800	3264160	When sheep attack.
3264160	3265480	It's pretty bad.
3265480	3271200	All right, as was that joke.
3271200	3272800	Moving on.
3272800	3276600	Sierra Online, also Vivendi Games, is a part of that.
3276600	3280360	They have given us some more details about what is coming out on Xbox Live Arcade and
3280360	3282840	PC through the rest of the year.
3282840	3288280	There is a third person retro arcade shooter called Aces of the Galaxy.
3288280	3290720	There's another title called Boogie Bunnies.
3290720	3294840	This is a game where players match rabbits in a match three puzzle game.
3294840	3298040	Those are both coming out on the PC and Xbox Live Arcade.
3298040	3299040	Rabbit threesomes?
3299040	3301720	I don't even want to go there.
3301720	3307840	Coming from Wanako Studios, an Xbox Live arcade shooter, Assault Heroes, that of course I
3307840	3311420	believe was already on the Xbox Live Arcade.
3311420	3317140	It's going to retail shelves on the PC for $19.99.
3317140	3325080	Also coming out, Arcadian Warriors, and 33 Scar, Resurrection Ship, Exodus, and the one
3325080	3328800	some people have been looking forward to or not looking forward to because it may bastardize
3328800	3334040	what they know and love, Battlestar Galactica, where you can play as the humans or the Cylons.
3334040	3339280	Sixteen player online gaming on the PC, eight players on Xbox Live Arcade, even though the
3339280	3343760	early reviews on that were mediocre at best, but they've had a long time since then.
3343760	3346080	I'm sure that was an early version, so you never know in my head.
3346080	3347080	Who knows?
3347080	3348080	Let's be fair.
3348080	3349080	Time makes games better.
3349080	3350080	You never know.
3350080	3351080	You never know.
3351080	3353280	That's what we're all hoping with Smash Brothers Brawl, right?
3353280	3354280	Right?
3354280	3355280	Right.
3355280	3356280	We'll see.
3356280	3359400	Speaking of a geek as I am, I never got into Battlestar Galactica.
3359400	3360400	Well...
3360400	3361400	Jamie, show me the way.
3361400	3362400	Hang your head in shame.
3362400	3366040	Actually, I haven't watched any at all Battlestar Galactica since the one from the 70s.
3366040	3367040	Oh, okay.
3367040	3370080	Well, I don't feel so bad now.
3370080	3371080	But I have...
3371080	3372080	Ladies, I have season one and two if you need it.
3372080	3374000	But I has Doctor Who.
3374000	3381400	Anyway, anyone who cares, Speedball 2 is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.
3381400	3385720	I care, Jamie.
3385720	3391940	And I think this is funny that it was referred to like this on Joystiq, that it's like Calvin
3391940	3395840	Ball for anyone who reads Calvin and Hobbes.
3395840	3399720	Calvin Ball is the game where you make up your own rules as you go.
3399720	3402820	I demand euphoria.
3402820	3405960	So yeah, Calvin Ball the game.
3405960	3409000	Anyways, let's see here.
3409000	3415360	For those who may not be into Calvin Ball, there are some other tidbits on Xbox Live
3415360	3420780	Marketplace that you might be interested in, including a whole fucking ton of demos.
3420780	3424320	The Simpsons game is actually on there now.
3424320	3425320	Definitely check it out.
3425320	3427320	I forgot I did play that this week.
3427320	3428320	Awesome.
3428320	3429320	Awesome game.
3429320	3432280	If you're a Simpsons fan, you're going to love it.
3432280	3436760	Which, of course, is based off the movie and comic series, and it's supposed to be very,
3436760	3437760	very bloody.
3437760	3438760	I haven't got a chance to play it yet.
3438760	3439760	I tried it.
3439760	3440760	I will soon.
3440760	3441760	I tried it.
3441760	3443800	I could not understand the control system at all.
3443800	3444800	So I don't know.
3444800	3449320	I just hit mash one button, swung my sword, and there was lots of blood, and I died a
3449320	3450320	lot.
3450320	3455080	At least that's why they have demos, so you don't have to waste $60 to find that out.
3455080	3457080	Project Gotham Racing 4 is up there now.
3457080	3458320	I played that one.
3458320	3459320	It's pretty.
3459320	3460320	It's fun.
3460320	3461320	But I really suck at it.
3461320	3462520	I cannot control the car for shit.
3462520	3464040	I just have not figured out.
3464040	3467640	The only racing game I can control worth a damn besides Mario Kart is Burnout.
3467640	3468920	These other ones, I can't do it.
3468920	3470440	I keep crashing into walls.
3470440	3472040	I highly recommend, Rob.
3472040	3474560	I swear you're going to love this game.
3474560	3475960	Flat-out ultimate destruction.
3475960	3477600	I played the demo for that, too.
3477600	3478600	I did.
3478600	3480360	Based on your recommendation, I downloaded the demo for that.
3480360	3481360	It was kind of fun.
3481360	3485380	A little clunkier than Burnout for me, but I like the fact that when you ran people off
3485380	3487880	the road, it actually told you who you just killed.
3487880	3488880	That was pretty fun.
3488880	3489880	And they get pissed off at you, too.
3489880	3490880	Yes.
3490880	3491880	That was good.
3491880	3492880	That was good.
3492880	3493880	Yeah.
3493880	3494880	Ultimate destruction.
3494880	3497080	And the majority of them were hot chicks that I was offing.
3497080	3502000	A lot of them look like the cast of The Fast and the Furious and shit, so it's funny.
3502000	3503000	Let's see.
3503000	3506640	Fear Files, that's going to be coming up as well.
3506640	3510520	And then finally, Virtua Fighter 5.
3510520	3511520	Lots of demos.
3511520	3512520	Check them out.
3512520	3514520	More demos, I'm sure, this week.
3514520	3515520	Woohoo.
3515520	3523000	All right, well, Microsoft is cracking down on naughty, naughty, naughty, very naughty
3523000	3525480	mottos that people have in their gamer tag.
3525480	3529320	Not so much the tag itself, but you know how everybody on Xbox 360 gets a motto, a little
3529320	3531680	line that they can have under their name?
3531680	3536040	For instance, mine is OrangeLawnTrader.com, trying to plug the site in very cheap ways.
3536040	3538920	So when people kick my ass at Halo, they'll go, hey, let's check out this guy's crappy
3538920	3540860	podcast that he does with his friends.
3540860	3541860	So yeah, that's there.
3541860	3543200	I don't know what you guys have for your mottos.
3543200	3546040	What do you have for your motto, Loki?
3546040	3547040	I don't remember.
3547040	3548040	You don't remember?
3548040	3549040	No.
3549040	3550040	Wow.
3550040	3551040	Does anybody?
3551040	3552040	What's yours, puppy?
3552040	3553040	Do you remember?
3553040	3554040	I honestly, you know what?
3554040	3557240	I only made it a month ago, and I don't remember it, because it's really not important.
3557240	3559040	I think it'd be funny the first time.
3559040	3564960	I think I had, it's so much fun, and then I think I just changed it to the website.
3564960	3565960	Nice.
3565960	3569900	Well, one of our fellow independent podcasters found out the hard way that Microsoft is actually
3569900	3575380	keeping an eye on those mottos, Cheepy D over at the Cheap Ass Gamer.
3575380	3579840	They're the guys that won the podcast award this year, so good for them, but they got
3579840	3585360	banned from Xbox Live for a day for saying, Konnichiwa, bitches, in their motto.
3585360	3591980	Apparently Microsoft does not appreciate the word bitch, because poor Cheepy D, yeah, they're
3591980	3593520	offended by the word Konnichiwa.
3593520	3594520	Come on.
3594520	3595520	They're racist.
3595520	3600200	You know what's funny is that when I read that, I think of the Robins song, but maybe
3600200	3602280	I'm just, I don't know, I'm crazy.
3602280	3606600	Anyway, also another user on the site, an unnamed user, but I think I actually know
3606600	3608760	who this might be if you listen to All Games Radio.
3608760	3613920	There is a person whose motto was, called the shit poop, but they used a little wavy
3613920	3619720	thing for the S and a little symbol for the P in poop, so it got past the little language
3619720	3620720	filters.
3620720	3623700	I'm thinking, you know, there's a guy on All Games called, he called the shit poop is actually
3623700	3626480	his nickname, and I'm like, it must be the same guy.
3626480	3630280	So these poor guys are getting booted for, well, they're not booted, but they're getting
3630280	3634960	the ban for a day for their naughty mottos and getting a nasty email and all that stuff.
3634960	3639960	Now here's my thing is I want to know what exactly does Microsoft consider offensive.
3639960	3644000	I'm like, the bans are just for a day, so let's have a little fun with this.
3644000	3645400	Let's push the limits.
3645400	3653080	So tonight I'm going to change my motto to fisting fan, and I want to see if anybody
3653080	3657120	catches that that could be actually a pornographic thing, and I'm like, I meant like, you know,
3657120	3659560	I meant like karate, fisting.
3659560	3662160	So we'll see what happens.
3662160	3667480	The national term in karate, you have valleys, fisting.
3667480	3671320	So I'm going to change my motto tonight to like, I heart fisting or fisting fan or fan
3671320	3678200	of fisting, and I want to see if that will get by the censors, so we'll see what happens.
3678200	3692000	One of Dan's friends, his gamer tag is, okay, I have to think of how he has it, DuckMySock.
3692000	3696300	Apparently one of the listeners over at AllGames, Flaming Bozo is reporting, one of the other
3696300	3701680	listeners at AllGames, Buck Fush, was his nickname, Buck Fush got banned for a day because
3701680	3704080	his motto said Bush Plan 9-11.
3704080	3708800	Apparently, that was a no-no.
3708800	3711560	Who cares?
3711560	3715040	Seriously, Microsoft, who cares?
3715040	3716920	Okay, Loki, a seat now, good.
3716920	3717920	I like this.
3717920	3721560	The chat room is coming up with things that are questionably offensive for us to put in
3721560	3722560	our mottos.
3722560	3725520	So, Loki, you're going to use this one from Takeo Ray, okay?
3725520	3730040	Dirty Sanchez is all around.
3730040	3733440	Can you change your motto to that and see if you get banned for a day?
3733440	3734440	It's just a day.
3734440	3736040	It's just one day.
3736040	3737040	You can go without Halo for a day.
3737040	3740200	I can get banned for a whole other reasons, but...
3740200	3741200	All right.
3741200	3746720	Oh, Son of Dad is doing a little play on what there is there.
3746720	3747720	My new...
3747720	3748720	Oh, Son of Dad's...
3748720	3753000	No, I guess Son of Dad's new motto says, Halo Soaks Cork.
3753000	3756120	I like Frisbees.
3756120	3757720	Frisbees says, buy a Wii.
3757720	3760560	I don't have an Xbox in my...
3760560	3761560	That's not an Xbox, sorry.
3761560	3762560	I'm sorry.
3762560	3763560	Oh, 360.
3763560	3764560	Oh, 360.
3764560	3765560	Okay.
3765560	3766560	Well, Megsy's got one, but she doesn't have time to play.
3766560	3767560	She's studying for finals.
3767560	3772080	But can someone in chat, for me, or anyone who's listening, who wants to actually participate,
3772080	3775520	add something to the lesbian, or like, I like dykes or something?
3775520	3776520	Yeah.
3776520	3777520	Carpet muncher.
3777520	3778520	Carpet muncher.
3778520	3779520	How do you know?
3779520	3780520	That could be my cat.
3780520	3781520	Sharmi used to do that.
3781520	3782520	My cat does that too.
3782520	3783520	Our witness says, I like box.
3783520	3791520	My mom says, if I want to be a lesbian, I have to lick a lot of carpet.
3791520	3793520	Pretty much.
3793520	3794520	Anyway.
3794520	3796920	It's really that simple.
3796920	3798560	I make you an honorary lesbian.
3798560	3799560	Damn it.
3799560	3805680	All there is in this house are hardwood floors.
3805680	3806680	That's true.
3806680	3809880	I think it's a special time, Rob.
3809880	3813840	Okay, Color of Sakura's going to change his motto to say, the rug doctor.
3813840	3815920	Oh, God, yes.
3815920	3817160	That's awesome.
3817160	3820740	So we need to start a thread in the forums for questionable mottos that get caught by
3820740	3821740	Microsoft.
3821740	3822740	Yeah.
3822740	3823740	That would be funny.
3823740	3829680	Somebody start that up, orangetownsradio.com, forums, plug plug, or like have one that says,
3829680	3831960	I want a fag, or something like that.
3831960	3833320	Yeah, but fag means cigarette, right?
3833320	3834320	Yeah, exactly.
3834320	3835320	Okay, here's the thing.
3835320	3838140	If you get banned for reals, like permanently though, you can't blame us, okay?
3838140	3841320	You're doing this at your own, because I don't want no lawsuit, like, oh, those assholes
3841320	3843040	on Orange Island Radio told me you changed my mottos.
3843040	3845320	No, you're doing it for yourself, okay?
3845320	3849000	But we really appreciate it, so give it to pure pleasure.
3849000	3851640	The only cool kids do it.
3851640	3852640	Segment.
3852640	3854040	Ah, yes.
3854040	3855760	I'm sorry.
3855760	3861080	We have a segment coming up now, because we're over an hour now, so it's time for part A
3861080	3862080	to finish up.
3862080	3866960	And you know we like to close out part A here at Orange Lounge Radio by respecting our elders
3866960	3870600	and paying tribute to a classic video game.
3870600	3873640	It's Dark Sakura's classic game of the week.
3873640	3879560	Dark Sakura, what game should all the kids be putting in their Gamefly cues right now?
3879560	3890040	The classic game of the week for all of you awesome people who own a Saturn.
3890040	3897520	Magical Night's Dream Cotton Boomerang, which is a fantastic game.
3897520	3904760	And Boomerang is actually a Saturn port of Cotton 2, so actually if you've got BAME,
3904760	3911160	you can play the game on your emulator, and it'll run just fine, but it was basically
3911160	3915840	going back to the original Cotton the way that it worked as being a side-scrolling shooter
3915840	3917840	with extra fun.
3917840	3921680	And I know I've talked about Panorama Cotton and Rainbow Cotton a lot.
3921680	3927960	Those are sort of special in the series in the fact that they are behind the character
3927960	3930720	view, and they're actually kind of hard to play.
3930720	3937460	But Cotton Boomerang is completely side-scroller with lovely animations and levels, but you
3937460	3943800	also get pretty much unlimited magic, and you get all these different skills and items
3943800	3944800	that you can use in the game.
3944800	3951160	Like my favorite item in this game is this big ball of fire.
3951160	3955920	And what you do with the big ball of fire is you bounce it, and you actually will have
3955920	3960000	lines of enemies that come at you, and you can bounce the ball at, and it'll just knock
3960000	3963400	out complete lines of enemies.
3963400	3966800	And the cool thing about the Cotton series, though, is that there was also this collector
3966800	3974800	thing that if you got different Cotton games, like Panorama Cotton was one, and keep in
3974800	3982160	mind they only made something about 600 copies of this game, and there were only 300 of these
3982160	3984960	tea cups that they issued out.
3984960	3989840	There was one with the original Cotton version.
3989840	3991200	There was the Panorama Cotton one.
3991200	3995680	There's a Cotton 2 cup, but they don't know how many of them are out in circulation, but
3995680	3999560	these are like lots of money now.
3999560	4005840	For anyone who wants to play any of the Cotton games, if you've got a Neo Geo Pocket Color,
4005840	4010760	and I think it actually came out on DS, I want to say, there's also a Super Nintendo
4010760	4011760	version.
4011760	4016760	They did release Cotton on a number of systems, but I'd have to say of the side-scrollers,
4016760	4023440	the best of them is Cotton 2, it's just really, really a lot of fun.
4023440	4027240	And I love that in the bonus stages we pick up tea cups.
4027240	4032040	I just like the concept of a side-scrolling shooter game starring witches flying on brooms.
4032040	4033480	That's just kind of rad and original.
4033480	4039000	The whole story behind it is that Cotton is this little witch girl who is addicted to
4039000	4042920	this candy called Willow that makes her throw up.
4042920	4047960	And this, she rescues, kind of like how I'm addicted to crack.
4047960	4049520	It makes me throw up too.
4049520	4050520	Whatever.
4050520	4055940	Anyway, and she rescues this fairy, this fairy named Silk comes to get her help.
4055940	4057620	That's her, by the way.
4057620	4061760	That's a sexy mama that comes up there on the little stage selection screen.
4061760	4063400	Is that Cotton's lesbian lover?
4063400	4064400	What is that?
4064400	4065400	That's the fairy Silk.
4065400	4068760	Well, of course, there has to be some gratuitous tea shot somewhere.
4068760	4072160	And the whole point of this game is that, and the whole reason that the character is
4072160	4078320	participating in this adventure at all is because either she wants candy, or someone
4078320	4083700	is threatening her supply of candy, and she's only doing it for the candy, she could give
4083700	4089240	a shit about the trials and tribulations of the land she's rescuing because she wants
4089240	4090240	candy.
4090240	4091240	Is she single?
4091240	4092240	Probably.
4092240	4094200	But I'd like to do her if I was.
4094200	4095760	She's also a little girl.
4095760	4098120	Oh, wow.
4098120	4101200	Cotton is a little girl.
4101200	4102200	She's a very little girl.
4102200	4104560	Well, the graphics is just awesome.
4104560	4111200	Rob's got something on YouTube that's, yeah, video one, and it's pretty much showing what
4111200	4113720	the game is looking like, and the graphics.
4113720	4114720	How old is this game?
4114720	4116720	This came out on the Sega Saturn.
4116720	4117720	The graphics are awesome.
4117720	4125200	I do want to say that this game came out in 95, I want to say.
4125200	4128200	The Saturn in Japan came out in 93, Rob.
4128200	4134640	No, it came out in 94 because I had just started college and my friend imported a Saturn that
4134640	4135640	year.
4135640	4141920	But, yeah, I want to say that Cotton Boomerang came out in 95, and it's, for anyone who's
4141920	4144560	a fan of 2D shooters, this game is gorgeous.
4144560	4145560	I mean, really.
4145560	4146560	Yeah, it really is.
4146560	4148560	And it's a ton of fun.
4148560	4152920	So I'd say anyone who's got name or the equivalent, fine.
4152920	4157840	If you want to play it on one of your emulators, you'll find it as Cotton 2, but if you've
4157840	4161560	got a Saturn, find this game in Japan, it's really a ton of fun.
4161560	4166480	And I can say that I have played through Cotton 2, or Cotton Boomerang, and it's really great.
4166480	4168600	I don't actually own it myself.
4168600	4174360	Cotton Boomerang, or Cotton 2, is the classic game of the week, as judged by Dark Sakura.
4174360	4175360	Very cool.
4175360	4176360	This game looks like fun.
4176360	4179600	I'm actually thinking I want to check that out too at some point, so, very cool.
4179600	4181200	I'm liking this new segment.
4181200	4182200	What do you guys think?
4182200	4184240	Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com if you want to send us an email.
4184240	4187360	If you have a suggestion, a game that Jamie needs to check out to consider for the segment,
4187360	4190600	even though I think you have your next month and a half already picked out.
4190600	4196760	Actually, I make sure to pick them out ahead of time.
4196760	4202040	And Dark Tetsuya, thank you, he posted a link to the PanoramaCotton Mega Drive one that
4202040	4203880	has the teacup with it.
4203880	4206760	And I actually do know somebody who has a copy of PanoramaCotton.
4206760	4211640	If anybody wants to have a headache, then go on YouTube and look at, well actually,
4211640	4215880	PanoramaCotton, I've played on the Genesis emulator, but my friend owns a legit copy.
4215880	4219160	It really is fun, but Rainbow Cotton was really fun too.
4219160	4222280	That was the Dreamcast version that's the same type of game.
4222280	4223280	All right.
4223280	4227000	Well, that's going to do it for Orange Lounge Radio, this part A of our podcast, but don't
4227000	4228000	worry.
4228000	4232000	We're going to be right back with part B, and in part B tonight, we're being joined
4232000	4234920	by Craig Howard and Ben Ward from Bizarre Creations.
4234920	4239680	They're going to be here to talk about Geometry Wars Galaxies, so we'll be right back with
4239680	4245200	part B of our show.
4245200	4248800	And for those of you guys listening live tonight, first off, I apologize for those audio issues
4248800	4251200	because now it's already like 7.30, but that's okay.
4251200	4253920	We'll just pretend part A was really long because it was.
4253920	4256040	We're going to be right back in a little bit with part B of our show.
4256040	4259680	If you're listening on AllGames.com, the Kirkpockin and Hendricks review is up next.
4259680	4262080	It's sandwiched in between part A and B of our show.
4262080	4266640	One guy from the US and one guy from the UK reviewing the exact same game.
4266640	4270080	And speaking of folks from the UK, did you know, Dark Soccer, that Bizarre Creations
4270080	4271080	is in the UK?
4271080	4272080	Yes.
4272080	4276760	So yeah, I actually had to get up at like six in the morning to interview these guys,
4276760	4277760	so it's going to be cool.
4277760	4278760	We're going to have them on.
4278760	4280400	That would have been two o'clock in the afternoon there.
4280400	4281400	Yep, sure was.
4281400	4283680	They probably were well fed and well rested after lunch.
4283680	4286800	Although there was some snafus with the time zone stuff, but I'll talk about that when
4286800	4289120	we come back in part B. Remember, eight hour time difference.
4289120	4293520	I made a bad boo-boo when I was late, so I made myself look very unprofessional.
4293520	4297680	I'll tell you more about that in part B. For those of you guys listening on OrangeLawnsRadio.com,
4297680	4302400	you're getting some music, specifically tonight, some of the music from the Wangan Midnight
4302400	4305060	Maximum Tune 3 soundtrack.
4305060	4308920	So don't drive right now, because you might drive really, really fast through this music.
4308920	4335280	We'll be right back in about ten minutes.
