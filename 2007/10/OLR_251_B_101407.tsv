5760	12240	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links
12240	15480	to websites with listings of past episodes.
15480	19720	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19720	23600	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Part B of our podcast.
23600	27760	Of course, Orange Lounge Radio is released twice every week, once on Sundays right after
27760	30440	our live program has finished taping, and once on Tuesdays.
30440	35200	That is a slightly different schedule, starting last week is when we started that new schedule.
35200	40160	Joining us tonight in Orange Lounge Radio Part B, Craig Howard, game manager, and Ben
40160	42160	Ward, community manager for Bizarre Creations.
42160	46800	We're going to be talking Geometry Wars Galaxies in just a little bit, but first we're going
46800	48360	to get back to the news.
48360	50920	So Loki, why don't you start us off in this Part B.
50920	58200	Anyway, so of course the 40GB PS3 has now been rumored to be coming out in the U.S.
58200	62800	on November 2nd, that would be the same, I think it's around the same time as the Euro
62800	63800	version.
63800	68800	Anyway, same issues with the European model, it's not going to have backwards compatibility
68800	69800	to PlayStation 2.
69800	73920	And I stand corrected from what I said last week, I was a little confused with the chips
73920	75440	and what they did and shit.
75440	80520	So originally they had taken out the Emotion engine, which dropped the backwards compatibility
80520	84460	a little bit, now they removed the second chip that did the rest of the backwards compatibility
84460	85460	for PlayStation 2.
85460	89560	So it's not a software thing, it is something that they're doing to save money, still stupid
89560	90560	though.
90560	96440	They took out one of the biggest marketing things they had, I mean they were totally
96440	97680	doing it around that Emotion.
97680	101920	You don't have to buy that version, you can spend $100 more and buy one that does play
101920	104120	some...
104120	108720	Basically they removed it's soul, or my soul, depending on how you want to look at it.
108720	112920	But hey, that's okay because you'll buy a 48 PS3 if you're in Japan because they're
112920	113920	white.
113920	117240	And that makes all the difference.
117240	121040	They're available in white, as well as black.
121040	124400	Any chance we might get the other colors over here?
124400	127120	Or do they say, are they going to be all Nintendo?
127120	130720	We don't need to do different colors right now, even though we always do different colors,
130720	133120	because the current consoles are still selling like crazy.
133120	136360	We don't want to confuse people anymore, you know.
136360	140360	I don't know, eventually I'm sure there will be different console colors, much like there
140360	141360	is with the PS2.
141360	146600	But PS2, they stuck with black for a long time, until silver, I think that was just
146600	147600	this summer.
147600	153120	So, I mean, shit, they're a little late to the game with the colors for the PS2 as well.
153120	159760	Going to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, GS68 says, white PS3s, I call racism.
159760	164640	Did anybody else do that ad?
164640	165640	What?
165640	170320	You guys already probably covered it, it just reminded me of that ad for I think a PSP in
170320	171320	Japan.
171320	176000	That was a long time ago, it just reminded me of it, that white chick.
176000	181040	Chris the lesbian, taking us back to the sounds of 2006, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
181040	182440	Love you, Chris.
182440	183440	You're up.
183440	184440	Bite me.
184440	191240	Okay, so we know Sony has these white and black issues.
191240	196120	Why not red, where's the red love, and the yellow love, and the blue love and the purple
196120	197120	love, huh?
197120	198120	Where is it?
198120	199120	American love.
199120	202400	Well, you aren't going to get any love.
202400	207680	You see those extra colors, that costs money, and obviously they're trying to save money.
207680	212560	Actually, I take it back, there is a red PlayStation 3, I think they made like three of them, because
212560	217040	I seem to remember some Canadian contest where they were giving away like red PS3s in Canada.
217040	219800	Or you can go on the internet and buy them in any color.
219800	223460	Or you can go to Target and get a can of spray paint.
223460	227460	Just be careful.
227460	232440	But I have to have one that matches my carpet.
232440	234080	I'm being hypothetical.
234080	240320	Alright, anyhow, speaking of the Sony PSP, see at least Chris was able to take us on
240320	245440	the right path, and take us over to the PSP, and we want to talk about some first party
245440	248960	PSP titles that are coming in the year 2008.
248960	253140	There's going to be seven first party download titles coming to the PSP.
253140	254140	Now how does that work?
254140	256440	Because I haven't downloaded anything on the PSP yet.
256440	260480	I haven't either.
260480	264520	Well I guess you take your PSP, connect to the Sony store, and you can download all of
264520	265520	these.
265520	269120	It's eventually going to be with the Sony store on PC or on the PS3, you just download
269120	276040	it and you transfer it to the memory stick, and hopefully it's a lot better than the stupid
276040	279880	demos, because the demos you have to put in this fucking specific directory and they have
279880	285240	all these specific instructions instead of, throw it in the games folder and it will work.
285240	286880	You know, something like that.
286880	291540	Well there's going to be three action games, two music games, one shooter, and one racer.
291540	295680	But if you were hoping I was going to name those seven titles, sorry, that story's in
295680	296680	another castle.
296680	301720	You know, sorry, this kind of brings me back to that WiiWare story that we did in part
301720	309360	A, but I remember there was also a Hudson karaoke game that's coming to WiiWare.
309360	310360	Hudson's cool.
310360	321560	Well, as long as I can sing Fergalicious, to the E, to the R-G-I-L-E, no one can hear
321560	322560	you.
322560	331280	So a new demo was announced for the PS3 store, which is Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction.
331280	342600	Also, I think out for a demo is NHL 2K8 and Conan, but Sony's recent update was also saying
342600	348040	that they were also going to be putting up demos for Uncharted, Folklore, and Fallout
348040	350040	3.
350040	373120	Demos, demos, demos.
373120	376600	When did EA become a contestant on Supermarket Sweep?
376600	379600	I mean seriously, they're taking these gaming companies and just throwing them into the
379600	382480	carts like the hams that they used to have on the show.
382480	383480	Does anybody know what I'm talking about?
383480	384480	Yes, I do.
384480	386400	Please tell me someone in the chat knows what I'm talking about when I say they're being
386400	387400	like Supermarket Sweep.
387400	393440	So anyways, and then of course Pandemic, they're making the brand new Mercenaries 2 game, which
393440	395520	looks pretty cool.
395520	397480	So lots of good stuff.
397480	401320	No word on what's going to happen with Mass Effect since it's being published by Microsoft
401320	406600	this time, but who knows, Mass Effect 2 is definitely going to be published by EA.
406600	409760	Why do they have that picture?
409760	413220	So it's very interesting.
413220	415360	Why do you think EA is trying to buy all these companies?
415360	416360	What's their strategy?
416360	419600	Is it just like a Monopoly type thing or they're just trying to grab the, I mean, because Bioware
419600	422720	doing Mass Effect, I mean, they're just trying to foresee that, oh, this is going to be a
422720	423720	huge title.
423720	431120	Because Activision is bizarre, so, you know, they got a monkey see monkey do, I don't know.
431120	437880	Activision and like EA are in this pissing contest to who can make the best games.
437880	441120	Hint to Activision, stay away from Spider-Man games.
441120	443920	Not doing very good for you.
443920	449360	Sorry, I was looking up on YouTube some clips of Supermarket Sweep, but I guess we'll have
449360	452440	to, I want you all in the studio to know I'm not crazy.
452440	456840	This was a real bad ass TV show they used to have on the telly.
456840	457840	Do you?
457840	462240	My granny used to watch it and I'd be, I'd have to watch it when I went to Dothan.
462240	465840	I used to make my grandma watch it.
465840	470180	I used to watch it all the time with like one of the early morning game shows back when
470180	473720	I was like 10 years old and all I watched was game shows.
473720	478040	Now when I was 10 years old, the things that we watched were reruns of Press Your Luck.
478040	483080	No, Amy, no, Amy, no, Amy, no, Amy, no, Amy, stop!
483080	486780	What dude, when I used to go shopping with my mom and I would put these random, like
486780	490640	Nintendo magazines and candy in the cart, my mom would be all, how did that get there?
490640	494960	I'm like, I'm practicing to be on Supermarket Sweep.
494960	495960	Innocent look.
495960	499400	Why did I hear 50 hams in our cart?
499400	502480	I don't know, I like ham.
502480	508080	Christmas is coming, didn't you get the memo?
508080	513240	PlayStation Network is getting some updates, or actually got some updates, not only the
513240	517240	Ratchet and Clank demo, to which Jamie earlier mentioned, but also a title that a lot of
517240	520320	folks have been looking forward to, Everyday Shooter.
520320	523720	So it's kind of cool that the PlayStation is now getting some kind of like, you know,
523720	527980	indie-ish games you can't get other places and Everyday Shooter is one of those games
527980	529240	I've heard a lot of good things about.
529240	530960	You can get a wrestler for that kind of stuff.
530960	531960	What?
531960	532960	If you're an everyday shooter.
532960	537480	I'm not talking about like going out and shooting people from a clock tower or whatever.
537480	542240	I'm talking about, Chris, your jaw just dropped and like hit the hardwood floor.
542240	547040	While I was in Madison, I don't know the details and you guys may have covered it, but some
547040	551120	guy was going through one of the University of Wisconsin buildings.
551120	556360	I don't know if he had a weapon with him, or I forgot what exactly the details were,
556360	560320	but he ended up jumping out of a window and the reason he was, you know, he was running
560320	563880	around the building like he was shooting things, because he thought he was playing the video
563880	564880	game Doom.
564880	565880	Wow.
565880	572360	And people wonder why video games are being purchased.
572360	576560	That's the problem is he was playing Doom still, I mean, he needs to really update his
576560	577560	game.
577560	580880	If we could ban him from Doom, we would.
580880	590560	You know what, Darwin Awards, that's a perfect candidate for the Darwin Awards.
590560	597200	Well Everyday Shooter will set you back $9.99, or to the rest of us that's $10.
597200	601320	Also on the PlayStation Network, you can get some Everyday Shooter wallpaper, and the cost
601320	602320	of that?
602320	603320	Free!
603320	608480	Some movie trailers as well, Spiderwick Chronicles, Walk Hard, The Assassination of Jesse James,
608480	612440	and some trailers for some video games, Fallout 3, Folklore, and I believe some things that
612440	616480	were already mentioned previously in the show.
616480	621040	So that means you gotta tune in, yo, listen to what we say.
621040	630100	So for those who were all, you know, happy about SingStar coming out, prepare to be unhappy.
630100	631100	Completely not happy.
631100	638760	It has been delayed past November 3rd, and it is hanging out, I guess, with Duke Nukem
638760	653800	forever in Limbo Land, going, uh, I exist in theory, but will I release, oh no, oh no.
653800	659600	They're not giving a reason for the delay, although the theories are that it's licensing
659600	668220	problems and PlayStation Network issues, um, but the Euro version will be out on time.
668220	671640	This kind of makes me sad, because I was looking forward to that whole, like, YouTubey channel
671640	676080	that they were going to be doing with SingStar, and, like, I was going to tape Loki in secret,
676080	679280	singing, like, Britney Spears or something, and then, like, put that up for the internet
679280	681700	to see, and they would have loved it.
681700	687240	So damn it, when we made the tingle bet, we should have made the tingle bet around SingStar.
687240	690820	Instead of Loki setting an eye of judgment on fire in a match with Bobby, what we should
690820	694240	have done is we should have made him do something on SingStar and then upload it to the network.
694240	696320	You know it would have been the number one video of all time.
696320	699480	Hey, you know, we still have I'm Staying In.
699480	702240	I know, but that's, that's, like, last year's joke.
702240	703240	I lied.
703240	704240	Actually, it's three years ago's joke.
704240	708000	You know what, though, at E3, I really liked SingStar, because I had some random guy come
708000	713320	up and we were singing, um, um, Motorhead at E3.
713320	716720	Do you have any My Chemical Romance on it?
716720	717720	I don't remember.
717720	720240	Well, they have the expandable store, so you could get probably tons of stuff on it.
720240	722440	I think everyone can get their emo on.
722440	725560	Yes, I'm sure there's one of those bands you can get your emo on.
725560	729200	I have a video of Meg Z singing that from her cell phone, so I think she would enjoy
729200	730200	that.
730200	732200	Meg Z is very much now obsessed with My Chemical Romance.
732200	733200	Interesting.
733200	738920	She has the emo kid haircut now.
738920	742040	She might be the first lesbian I've ever met who's obsessed with My Chemical Romance.
742040	745320	I don't usually, like, oh, second lesbian.
745320	746320	Sorry, Chris.
746320	750720	What about, like, I thought lesbians listened to, like, Melissa Etheridge and, uh, Katie
750720	755560	Lang and, uh, yeah, that I Kissed a Girl song and, uh, Sarah McLachlan.
755560	756560	Come on.
756560	757560	What's up?
757560	758560	What happened to Lilith Fair?
758560	766160	Yeah, well, most people think that a lot of gay guys don't play video games, Rob, and
766160	769240	the webcam can catch that look.
769240	771840	Well, what can we say?
771840	773600	We're special here at Orange Lawners Radio.
773600	774600	Very special.
774600	778120	We are special because, uh, we're getting back into the interview habit and getting
778120	782520	some people on our program, uh, coming on here and talking about the latest.
782520	786480	As you know, we here at Orange Lawners Radio have a strange fascination with the lolcats,
786480	789800	so if you were listening a few weeks ago, you know that the advertisements for Geometry
789800	792340	Wars Galaxies gave us a good laugh.
792340	795580	We knew we had to get them on the show to talk to them a little bit more about the ads
795580	797520	and more importantly, the game, and guess what?
797520	798520	We got them.
798520	802960	Craig Howard is a game manager for Bizarre Creations and worked on not only Geometry
802960	805800	Wars Galaxies but Boom Boom Rocket.
805800	810480	We were also joined during the interview by Ben Ward, Bizarre Creations' community manager.
810480	814560	Sadly, they couldn't be here live due to the time delay because they're over in the UK,
814560	824240	but let's listen in on what they had to say earlier this week.
824240	825240	How are you doing out there, Craig?
825240	826240	Yeah, I'm doing well, thanks.
826240	827240	Awesome.
827240	828240	It's a little bit cold at the moment.
828240	833040	We'll see you here as well as Ben Ward as well as some Bizarre.
833040	834040	Oh, great.
834040	837080	Welcome, both of you guys, to the program.
837080	840400	Of course, there's a little bit of a delay here since we are talking from such a cross
840400	844960	a great distance because you guys are based out over there in the UK, right?
844960	847360	Yeah, it rained in Liverpool.
847360	848360	Oh, right.
848360	850360	I'll do that at the moment.
850360	852000	It's just great.
852000	853000	Awesome.
853000	857200	So now, you've worked on games not only just like Geometry Wars but you've also worked
857200	859200	on Boom Boom Rocket in the past?
859200	860760	Yeah, that's right.
860760	861760	Yeah.
861760	862760	Awesome.
862760	867000	And the first thing I've got to ask you, since when do cats advertise video games?
867000	871600	I don't know, who came up with that idea?
871600	873000	Was it Roger Sierra?
873000	878920	It was just some crazy sort of idea that Sierra guys came up with and it sort of went with
878920	882320	the crazy commercial that we were running just before that.
882320	885840	Did you see the TV advert with all the guys dressed up as drum tour shapes?
885840	890840	I did, and that's available on the internet, on the website, too, and that's one of my
890840	894560	favorite songs you guys are using in the background for that advertisement.
894560	897400	It's a cover of a They Might Be Giants song, and so that's hilarious.
897400	898400	Yeah, you got it.
898400	903200	So that was just something that the guys at Sierra came up with, and they literally just
903200	907680	wanted to make it a little bit quirky and a little bit sort of unusual and pull the
907680	911200	sort of audience in that you wouldn't normally get in a drum tour game?
911200	913200	Yeah, I mean, we did.
913200	917800	One of the good things is it's not just like a sci-fi style advertising campaign if you
917800	918800	guys are drum tours.
918800	925120	It's very interesting to try to get more people interested in looking at the game.
925120	930120	Yeah, and it strangely seems to fit, you know, when you're hearing about Triangle Man, and
930120	933840	there actually are little triangle things that you're fighting in the game and everything,
933840	934840	right?
934840	935840	Yeah, totally.
935840	939400	Well, we couldn't really make it too serious because that's not really what drum tours
939400	940400	is about.
940400	944920	It's about having fun with your friends and sort of really getting stuck into a fun arcade
944920	945920	game.
945920	950400	It's not about realistically fighting geometric shapes in outer space or something, you know?
950400	952200	So it's all about having fun.
952200	953200	Absolutely, I agree.
953200	955040	It is all about having fun.
955040	961440	Tell me about, you know, Geometry Wars started as a part of Project Gotham Racing, turns
961440	965920	into this spin-off game that's hugely successful on Xbox Live Arcade.
965920	971160	Where did the decision come to take the game, the series, from the Xbox Live or the Xbox
971160	973040	platform over to the Nintendo platform?
973040	974560	It's a standalone series.
974560	979680	Well, I mean, one of the things with Geometry Wars is it's always kind of used to test code
979680	980680	as well.
980680	985600	And when we got the dev kits for Wii, we started to have an experiment.
985600	991240	Obviously, a few people started playing it, and then our ideas were going, initially,
991240	997480	there was no channel, there was no WiiWare or anything like that for the DS or Wii.
997480	1003080	So we thought if we were going to take it across into these platforms, what would we
1003080	1007400	give, how would we get it to make it feel worthwhile on those platforms?
1007400	1009960	It just seemed like a fun challenge, you know?
1009960	1011280	The controls are interesting.
1011280	1016320	Some people don't believe that it'll work well, but until you actually play the game,
1016320	1023360	the nunchuck and the, you know, it just feels so, it feels so much, it's different, but
1023360	1026200	it still feels really good and fun and involved when you play the game.
1026200	1031080	Yeah, it wasn't really sort of a eureka, hey, let's do Geometry Wars on the Wii or anything
1031080	1032080	like that.
1032080	1036440	It was built up, and we saw the new platforms, and we saw what they were capable of, and
1036440	1039840	somebody sort of said, hey, it'd be kind of cool if we put Geometry Wars on here.
1039840	1043840	So we did, and then it built up and built up, and then we got the guys at Sierra involved,
1043840	1048840	and they put Kuju in, and it just sort of built up into a full game over time.
1048840	1050800	Did you guys put motion control in the game?
1050800	1053660	I haven't really been able to get a sense of that from what I've read initially.
1053660	1057360	Is there motion, did you guys incorporate the Wii motion controls in the game?
1057360	1063680	Yeah, I mean, what you do is you use the, you point with the wand, and you use the nunchuck
1063680	1070080	to move around, sorry, I'm full of a cold at the moment, it's all very difficult to
1070080	1071080	speak.
1071080	1072080	That's alright.
1072080	1077760	So it's, yeah, so we've got the controls working on that, it works a little bit like a keyboard
1077760	1081960	and mouse in a way that the controls work, but it does feel really nice, and obviously
1081960	1085920	on the DS we support the stylus, so it works that way.
1085920	1086920	Very cool.
1086920	1091840	So the motion, so you're kind of like aiming either with the Wii mode or the stylus in
1091840	1096040	the case of the DS version, and then moving with the control, with the nunchuck or the
1096040	1097040	directional pad.
1097040	1098440	That's right, yeah.
1098440	1099440	Okay.
1099440	1103720	Now you mentioned about kind of exploring the various platforms when you were taking,
1103720	1109040	or I guess kind of developing on the Wii, and then kind of finding the Geometry Wars
1109040	1111000	was a good fit for the Wii.
1111000	1115480	What made you guys decide to kind of release this as its own standalone game, as opposed
1115480	1120080	to maybe something on the WiiWare service or a downloadable title very similar to what
1120080	1121080	it was on Xbox?
1121080	1126520	I think, well, I mean the DS obviously hasn't got anything like that, and the amount of
1126520	1130640	fans that come back and say they'd love to be able to play the game on the move is really
1130640	1134240	high, so it made sense to work on the DS.
1134240	1140440	The Wii game, I mean WiiWare still is quite a way off, well, it's getting closer now,
1140440	1146560	but at the time, yeah, it was just a way to take the game across to the new people.
1146560	1153480	I mean, we're not going for full retail price, it's going for a competitive price as well.
1153480	1156760	So you get a lot of gameplay there.
1156760	1160360	I was going to ask about that, because that's probably going to be a real shift for a lot
1160360	1165000	of people who, you know, the Geometry Wars was really known on the Xbox for being a very
1165000	1169600	cheap $5 title, and although Geometry Wars is going to be a budget title on the Wii,
1169600	1173480	there's still going to be a little increase in money for people who are now going to the
1173480	1176220	old-fashioned DVD and box format.
1176220	1181520	What can people expect to get for the extra money they're going to be spending?
1181520	1186800	It's a whole new campaign mode, since it gives you, sort of like 60 versions of Geometry
1186800	1193560	Wars, new enemies, you've got different sort of grid shapes, which makes a huge difference
1193560	1198240	in the way you play certain levels and the strategies, you've also got a drone, which
1198240	1203840	is one of the big new additions, you've got an autonomous drone, over the game you build
1203840	1208400	experience on this drone, you can nurture it to get new skills, that can give you more
1208400	1216080	battle strategies when you play the game, so there's a lot more there, it's also got
1216080	1221880	the original retro involved in there as well for fans of the game, and also the big one
1221880	1227720	as well, we've got multiplayer as well, which is also a nice new addition to the series.
1227720	1231960	We did sort of see those questions come in when we first sort of came up with this whole
1231960	1236680	concept, we did think that, hey, how are we going to justify charging however amount of
1236680	1241520	money to buy this game, and you know, we've really thrown in a hell of a lot of gameplay
1241520	1245280	to make it worthwhile for people, we don't want anyone to feel ripped off once they've
1245280	1249240	bought the game, but I don't think they will, because as Craig says, there's absolutely
1249240	1252120	loads of content in them.
1252120	1256280	All right, very cool, it does sound like, I like the comparison there, it's like Geometry
1256280	1261960	Wars retro is just kind of one level, whereas this new one's going to be about 60 and has
1261960	1265200	the upgrades and everything, that sounds pretty awesome.
1265200	1268600	One other thing that really caught my eye, because I don't see a lot of people doing
1268600	1273320	this on the Nintendo Wii right now, save one in-house Nintendo game I can think of, is
1273320	1278000	that you have the Wii and the DS functioning together in Geometry Wars.
1278000	1279800	Tell me a little more about how this works in the game.
1279800	1286440	Yeah, I mean if you have, there's quite a few ways of interconnecting the two platforms
1286440	1287440	work.
1287440	1292880	You can, if you have both versions of the game, you can unlock an extra solar system
1292880	1297880	within the game, with new unique maps and battles, so that's a reward people have brought
1297880	1299880	on both platforms.
1299880	1304600	Also, if you've just got the Wii version, or just the DS version, you can upload the
1304600	1310040	whole retro evolved to your DS or your friend's DS.
1310040	1314960	So again, a lot more people play in the game, that's the theory behind all of this.
1314960	1321920	So by doing that with one card reach, in the office a lot of people can be playing on multiplayer
1321920	1322920	games.
1322920	1323920	Things like that.
1323920	1327320	We try to be as generous as we can with the game.
1327320	1331640	And I noticed the Wi-Fi seal on the game too, does that mean you've got the online leaderboards
1331640	1332640	in that too?
1332640	1335360	That's right, yeah, we support full online leaderboards.
1335360	1340240	One of the caveats of the game is we wouldn't do it if we couldn't support online leaderboards.
1340240	1344280	Because no matter how good you are, you want to see how good you are against your friends
1344280	1346360	and against everyone else in the world.
1346360	1347360	Awesome.
1347360	1349920	Well, where do you guys see Geometry Wars going in the future?
1349920	1356320	Do you think there's a possibility of something based on Geometry Wars waves when, if the
1356320	1360440	Nintendo Wii version, DS versions are successful at continuing and growing of the franchise
1360440	1361760	on the Nintendo platforms?
1361760	1367600	Yeah, I mean, Geometry Wars is something that is its own beast and it's moving on in its
1367600	1369600	own mysterious past at the moment.
1369600	1375840	So there's definitely things that we're considering in the future and looking at at the moment.
1375840	1380680	It's great to be very careful with what he says, because I'm sort of holding a hammer
1380680	1384400	over his head at the moment saying, we haven't announced this yet!
1384400	1390080	But no, we're always looking at expanding, you know, there's a big fan base for the game
1390080	1395040	and we listen to our fans and we're trying to set aside them and get more people playing
1395040	1396040	the game.
1396040	1397360	Well, best of luck to you guys.
1397360	1402200	I hope the cats sell tons and tons of copies of Geometry Wars, because it certainly is
1402200	1407000	a, you know, Geometry Wars Retro was definitely one of my favorite Xbox Live download titles
1407000	1410320	and you gotta love the cats advertised in the game.
1410320	1412400	You definitely know you can trust them.
1412400	1417400	But I gotta ask you, since I understand, Craig, you're the game manager not only over Geometry
1417400	1419640	Wars, but you also worked on Boom Boom Rocket, right?
1419640	1420640	That's right.
1420640	1421640	Yeah.
1421640	1425440	Now, our radio station actually started based around music-based video games.
1425440	1429080	So we, you know, obviously snatched up Boom Boom Rocket when it first came out.
1429080	1434020	I'm kind of curious, is there going to be content in the future, maybe some expansions
1434020	1438960	on the songs in Boom Boom Rocket or a continuation of that franchise in one way or another?
1438960	1442920	Yeah, there's more to come from the world of Boom Boom Rocket.
1442920	1449200	I don't know exactly what I can say about that, but we've made additional content and
1449200	1453160	hopefully it's going to be releasing, but there's still all sorts of caveats that we
1453160	1457600	need to sort out with the publisher and Xbox Live Marketplace and all that sort of stuff.
1457600	1461000	So hopefully there will be something, but I don't want to commit to anything because
1461000	1463480	I don't know the details, to be honest.
1463480	1464480	Understandable.
1464480	1465680	I understand there's got to be secrets.
1465680	1469120	Well, thank you guys so much for being on the show today, but before I let you guys
1469120	1473080	go, we always ask all our guests that come on the program, we want to know how is your
1473080	1474080	gaming week?
1474080	1479360	What kind of video games have you been playing besides the ones at the office?
1479360	1486400	I've been playing Halo 3, obviously, Halo 3, and I've been playing Board of Ag on the
1486400	1489640	Dreamcast because it's a great show.
1489640	1495120	I've been playing Halo 3 as well, and I've just finished World in Conflict on PC, that's
1495120	1499080	awesome, I really, really love that, but I've been playing Halo 3 and then when Gotham hits
1499080	1503000	the shelves in the UK, I'll be playing that some more as well and beating all of our community
1503000	1507680	on that, or losing horribly to all of me on that, but yeah.
1507680	1511800	Sounds pretty awesome, I mean, I think the entire internet is playing Halo 3 right now,
1511800	1516280	but I have to ask the question, definitive question on Halo 3, do you prefer co-op or
1516280	1517280	competitive?
1517280	1518280	Co-op.
1518280	1519280	Competitive.
1519280	1525000	Ah, dissension amongst the ranks, all right.
1525000	1530120	You know, whoever said co-op, I'd be wary of the guy who said competitive there, and
1530120	1538200	well, thank you guys so much for being on the programme this week, is there anything
1538200	1543160	else you want to share with our listeners about the upcoming products at Bazaar?
1543160	1547360	Just hope, you know, you keep checking our website and see the stuff we're announcing
1547360	1551040	and give us feedback and we do listen to it.
1551040	1556160	Yeah, it's a very busy time at Bazaar right now, so I mean, we're just looking for everyone
1556160	1559640	to tell us what they think, tell us what they like, tell us what they don't like, and we're
1559640	1563280	going to build it into all our future projects and stuff, we welcome as much feedback as
1563280	1568240	we can get, so yeah, just stop by the website and shout on us, we like it.
1568240	1570240	And the website link for our listeners?
1570240	1572240	Oh, that's www.bazaarcreations.com.
1572240	1579600	All right, www.bazaarcreations.com for more information on such games like Geometry Wars
1579600	1583320	Galaxies and Boom Boom Rocket and things we didn't even touch on today like Project Gotham
1583320	1585120	Racing and so on.
1585120	1588080	Craig and Ben, thank you guys so much for being on the programme this week.
1588080	1589080	Thanks a lot.
1589080	1590080	Cheers.
1590080	1601520	All right, well, thank you very much to those folks from Bazaar Creations for joining us.
1601520	1603200	That was Craig, Howard and Ben Wharton.
1603200	1607680	I have to actually kind of give a little bit of personal apologies because the whole time
1607680	1612720	zone thing, I said I would interview them at 2 o'clock their time and I thought for
1612720	1617160	some reason when I looked it up on the internet, it said 7 a.m. but it actually ended up being
1617160	1620320	6 a.m. so I roll out of bed at like 6.30 and I check my email, they're like, we're waiting
1620320	1621320	for you to call.
1621320	1622320	I'm like, oh, no.
1622320	1623320	Time's up.
1623320	1625840	They were very good and very accommodating and they came back even though I was hideously
1625840	1630160	late and unprofessional so big thanks to those guys for coming on the programme.
1630160	1631160	So cool.
1631160	1635200	All right, and I got to say, just so you guys know, we're having some problems in our studio
1635200	1639080	right now so the live listeners unfortunately are locked out right now.
1639080	1643160	Basically the way it works is we have a big desktop computer that streams the internet
1643160	1647040	through our wireless network and up until now, it's been doing just fine but tonight
1647040	1651240	for whatever reason, the mainframe computer is not speaking to the wireless network.
1651240	1656000	It went down during that taped interview so we're on laptop power right now but unfortunately,
1656000	1659720	I am locked out of chat but I believe Dark Sakura used to have a connection to the chat
1659720	1663380	room but unfortunately the chat room can't hear our programme because the desktop computer's
1663380	1667920	down and not streaming to live 365.
1667920	1672320	It would, actually your mic's off too so they can't hear you but I know we're having all
1672320	1673320	sorts of problems tonight.
1673320	1674320	I'm in the chat.
1674320	1677320	Tonight's the kind of night where we just need to quit.
1677320	1678320	No, that's all right.
1678320	1680520	Hey, let's go quit and get fries.
1680520	1681520	That's all right.
1681520	1683880	We're going to just keep going with the show.
1683880	1686640	If the stream comes back in time, we'll do some Skype calls.
1686640	1690120	If not, unfortunately I guess this will be one for the tapes only.
1690120	1691120	What else can you do?
1691120	1693880	So we're going to go back to Loki with some gaming news.
1693880	1694880	Awesome.
1694880	1696880	I get a mic.
1696880	1703480	Anyways, so yeah, some fun information other than bizarre stuff.
1703480	1705040	Let's see here.
1705040	1711680	Our friends over all games of course, they have some ties with G4 and stuff and this
1711680	1715960	all goes back to of course Video Games Live.
1715960	1721080	Video Games Live, a wonderful show that's been going for a few years now I believe.
1721080	1725360	This year they, or at least I guess for the next year, they've got 25 new shows across
1725360	1732240	the US announced in their tour with a couple in Canada, one in London actually.
1732240	1736320	Of course this year they're going to have a new concert including music from Halo 3,
1736320	1741800	Bioshock, Conan, and Starcraft 2.
1741800	1747680	That's pretty cool and of course it's a little bit different than say your usual concerts,
1747680	1750840	all video game music, all done by an orchestra.
1750840	1751840	Very cool.
1751840	1756280	If you're in the area of one of those concerts, definitely worth checking out.
1756280	1761880	All righty, well you know the game Rock Band, if you want to have a concert of your own,
1761880	1765360	you're going to get this game Rock Band because it is going to have the guitars and the keyboards,
1765360	1768080	I'm sorry not the keyboards, I wish I had the keyboards, it's going to have the drum
1768080	1773200	set and the vocals and tambourines because you can use the microphone as a tambourine.
1773200	1776760	Well unfortunately the only way you're going to be able to get this game is in a bundle
1776760	1777880	form.
1777880	1780400	It's going to be bundle only in the year 2007.
1780400	1784560	You cannot get these separate peripherals until 2008.
1784560	1786480	Bundle only or game only, that's your only option.
1786480	1790880	But you can't get the actual guitar itself which is interesting because I went on All
1790880	1794520	Games Radio, I was doing the typical Monday plug because our show simulcast there so I
1794520	1798640	usually go on on Mondays to kind of plug the show that's coming up and one of the chatters
1798640	1802560	said I was wrong and that there was, because I thought for some reason I had heard this
1802560	1806760	earlier that only the bundle was going to be out in 2007 but they said I was wrong.
1806760	1810360	No, EA's been telling us that's what's been going on.
1810360	1812440	And now it was confirmed for the public this week.
1812440	1816160	Now what I'm thinking, maybe there was like a third party, like are third party controllers
1816160	1817160	going to be out and available?
1817160	1818160	Of course, right?
1818160	1819160	Maybe.
1819160	1822480	So maybe that's what it is but as far as the official first party peripherals, unfortunately
1822480	1826360	those are not going to be out until 2008.
1826360	1827360	Sorry guys.
1827360	1830600	So it's going to cost you 170 bucks to play a rock band unless you want to use your existing
1830600	1832960	guitars or microphones.
1832960	1836680	Well this one's sort of interesting to me although it's interesting in a quite different
1836680	1839840	way than probably how they're listing it.
1839840	1849960	There's a group of graduate students that have mapped video game controllers onto different
1849960	1859040	types of wearable fabrics where you can give massages while playing video games.
1859040	1866040	And on their website they give instructions on how to make one for yourself.
1866040	1871720	But I want to watch the video on this however it's not loaded up and given that I am a massage
1871720	1879600	therapist I have definite reservations for how safe this is because I know from personal
1879600	1883600	experience if you do it wrong you can fuck somebody up.
1883600	1890080	I mean that's why we have to go to school for however many hours and learn how to do
1890080	1891440	it right.
1891440	1894920	Let me ask your professional opinion, quote unquote, since you have gone to the school,
1894920	1896240	got the training and all that stuff.
1896240	1900160	There's a lot of people though that give the casual massages you know like in the privacy
1900160	1904120	of their own home like, oh baby I could really use a massage right now you know and no training
1904120	1905360	and that stuff right.
1905360	1910000	So as long as they're not applying a lot of pressure though as long as it's like a I don't
1910000	1913020	know what I'm doing type massage do you think it's okay?
1913020	1920100	Actually you can, this is just going from what they said in school, touch is very important
1920100	1928960	for people and even if it's really light there's still a lot of emotion that you can bring
1928960	1936520	out in another person, a lot of if they've got to say that they have a circulatory issue
1936520	1942120	you can actually cause problems with that, lymphatic problems you can move the length
1942120	1948340	in their skin and you have to be you, you have to be kind of careful, well they actually
1948340	1954960	have a full on hospital grade lymphatic massage for people like, for example a lot of women
1954960	1960640	who've had mastectomies they remove a lot of the lymph nodes and so you'll see these
1960640	1966080	deposits in their arms under their armpits from excess lymph drainage.
1966080	1975040	And so you run into when any one who's not a professional tries to give and it seems
1975040	1980000	to me that for to use a controller like this that have to be using a bit of pressure don't
1980000	1981000	you think?
1981000	1982000	Yeah.
1982000	1989020	So they run into a lot of risk with especially listening to me they're doing around the center
1989020	1993600	back you're dealing with problems dealing with the spine you can get into some nerve
1993600	1998440	damage everything the way it connects I would not agree with letting an unprofessional.
1998440	2004100	I'm looking at the official website for this massage-me.at is the official site for this
2004100	2008040	I don't see anything on the front page about you know doctor tests or anything now granted
2008040	2011240	I have not you know to this website's credit because I don't want to misrepresent anything
2011240	2014800	I've not looked through and through all these different pages that are here so I don't know
2014800	2019280	if they have any type of hey the doctor says it's okay but this looks like you know university
2019280	2024940	students to me I'm looking at this university students idea of you know something innovative
2024940	2031480	so yes it's innovative but could it be dangerous possibly I don't know I'm checking out their
2031480	2035240	thanks I'm trying to look at their blog yeah their thanks didn't say any doctor there's
2035240	2044240	nothing on here about being an actual professional massage therapist I'm looking at and they're
2044240	2049280	they're very true you know massage is very good for you and I know this from experience
2049280	2055940	but at the same point they have if they're not professional they don't have anything
2055940	2063260	on there listening any kind of credentials I would not condone having this type of thing
2063260	2067040	yeah I mean you know to enter these guys credit you know I don't want to again misrepresented
2067040	2071340	or whatever it seems like a really interesting idea and you know certainly they're thinking
2071340	2075120	outside the box but just for their own sake I hope they've consulted a doctor on it because
2075120	2078220	I don't see anything on the site they don't really have to consult a doctor just to consult
2078220	2083080	another massage therapist I'm confused you do the massage on somebody yes on the person
2083080	2089740	they're wearing this jacket that has the contacts in it oh and now if it's something like you
2089740	2096320	were saying like a little light you know massage then that's one thing but if you're and it
2096320	2102180	seems to me that if you're trying to play a game by doing it then turn out well then
2102180	2108660	now the only other thing that I know what might be good is having your feedback go through
2108660	2112240	the jacket sometimes when I get mad at the games I throw the controller against the wall
2112240	2120080	so I feel bad for the subject that has to be my massage well exactly you know you're
2120080	2124840	it seems to me that you'd be putting repetitive pressure in the same continuous area it'd
2124840	2129280	just be like having someone punch you in the back over and over and over again like mash
2129280	2133560	the b button mash the b button where wait sorry I just dislocated your shoulder where
2133560	2144760	the concept is interesting I would not and okay there's there's actually a list on here
2144760	2149880	that's telling how you know how to do it but they're not doing it right you're doing it
2149880	2157120	wrong you're doing it wrong all right well if you want more information on that it's
2157120	2161320	called massage me so we don't want to take too much time talking about it because we're
2161320	2165680	not a massage podcast but I do not condone this and on top of that I'm actually going
2165680	2170680	to be referring the site to the director of my school because this is actually potentially
2170680	2183480	very dangerous narc anyway anyways so anyway Konami's made a little boo-boo or somebody
2183480	2189160	has made a little boo-boo as far as advertising the brand new Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles
2189160	2196320	unfortunately the Beaumonts have now become the Beaumonts so I don't know it's a different
2196320	2202600	family that's destroying Dracula it's just you know quite a coincidence that their names
2202600	2208240	are so close together and of course there's been you know mistakes and ads before including
2208240	2217720	an ad for Tony Hawk's downhill Jam which was advertised as being on the Sony Wii so I don't
2217720	2225300	know mistakes happen much like the show the proofreaders out there are getting fired as
2225300	2233500	we speak what can we say all right the gods and heroes MMO is on indefinite hiatus we're
2233500	2239000	sorry to say unfortunately gods and heroes Rome rising was supposed to be this MMO that
2239000	2244100	was being developed by perpetual entertainment well the perpetual co-founder Chris McKibben
2244100	2249920	has posted an open letter saying stating the basically we were too ambitious in the terms
2249920	2254120	of the game's development and now that we're going to be shelving this title the team will
2254120	2259800	now have time to focus their attention elsewhere such as the Star Trek online MMO that's being
2259800	2264900	worked on by the same company so while this might be good news for Star Trek fans who
2264900	2270120	are hoping to see you know the best game possible for the Star Trek MMO this is kind of a bad
2270120	2274820	news for all those people who unfortunately lost their jobs over this and one of those
2274820	2279120	folks you might know who is working on the gods and heroes MMO you know our buddy Renee
2279120	2284200	who comes to the show sometimes unfortunately this affected her so on her behalf we will
2284200	2309000	dedicate this week's FUs of the week FU goes to the security at my work for saying oh there's
2309000	2318440	nothing we can do which was bullshit pure and utter stinky bullshit so I am going to
2318440	2324160	go back and take a photo of the license tag of that car say they can't find them oh fuck
2324160	2331680	you I can find them easily I saw them just the other day and I have a very good camera
2331680	2339440	I am not going I am not going to stop until justice is served judge Jamie's on the case
2339440	2346560	and if they decide to do nothing else I'm going to address it with our CEO about how
2346560	2351440	ineffectual our security is I'm sorry to hear that follow-up also kind of screwed up story
2351440	2358160	you told last week on the show so that's kind of unfortunate oh yes F that oh yes all right
2358160	2364440	because remember when I have my mind set to something I get results anything else anything
2364440	2372840	else fuck a whole bunch of that shit Loki I guess fuck you the fact that there's not
2372840	2377360	a lot of good games are you know I mean it's a bit of a lull until like next few weeks
2377360	2382640	when there's a ton of shit coming out so I need more stuff to play I need more time to
2382640	2390560	play it in two I'll go next and then we'll go to puppy and Chris my F you the week obviously

2453800	2459560	to kind of take some responsibility for her fucking actions and neat and also this is
2459560	2465040	the biggest one needs to realize that if you cannot accept the consequences of having a
2465040	2471040	child then don't get knocked up in the first place she did she literally told me and I
2471040	2477560	quote because I told everyone that I'm moving to Wisconsin in March oh you cannot she's

2532560	2536720	what to do but his girlfriend I seriously she needs to just get the shit kicked out
2536720	2540760	of her hopefully she doesn't listen to the show she does she doesn't know how to work
2540760	2546040	a computer well I'm gonna say she does it's just she just she got in a car crap this is
2546040	2552520	how well this is the level of stupid she got in a car crash the other the other week and
2552520	2556480	they everyone who's involved in the car accident got her information got everything they needed
2556480	2561520	to get she didn't get their names even she didn't get anything there was nothing that
2561520	2567280	she took away from this car crash except excuses and of course it's her fault she's gonna crash
2567280	2577320	into them damn woman all right I'm done all right that's gonna do it for the FUs the week
2577320	2581200	unfortunately the poltergeist still affecting our network we're still not live mm-hmm bummer
2581200	2588520	I know it's like Halloween this place is haunted what oh thank you Chris got a little picture
2588520	2596920	of the kitty wait I'll fix it thanks thanks just what I need well maybe the mailbag will
2596920	2600000	fix it because if this keeps up unfortunately we're not gonna be able to get to Skype tonight
2600000	2603880	and I know some folks want to call in do some game reviews but at least there's the old
2603880	2607920	mailbag and when you email us at mailbag at orange launch radio.com it's practically the
2607920	2611540	old-fashioned way of interacting with a podcast at this point but when the newfangled stuff
2611540	2616160	breaks we turn to the mailbag so mailbag orange launch radio.com dark soccer is gonna open
2616160	2629840	it up pick some of her favorites right now hey listen it is time for the mailbag so first
2629840	2637140	thing actually comes from Rob with two B's he sent a link to a story and this is very
2637140	2644360	Darwin awardee in Moscow a 10 year old kid suicide after parents banned computer games
2644360	2655920	and just to his name was Andre Smirnoff which I'm not gonna see anything who was a class
2655920	2664080	three student jumped to his death after his parents were blaming his bad conduct in school
2664080	2670140	and performance in class on video games and he had made a comment about it in his diary
2670140	2676960	and then jumped out of a window so I'm like yeah that just means that your kid was fucked
2676960	2684880	in the head also and to continue with his email also I loved your me argument about
2684880	2690320	microtransactions and other poorly named events if you really want to draw a line objectively
2690320	2698640	a transaction in quotes is a payment in monetary units a microtransaction would be a one one
2698640	2704600	thousandth of a transaction or less than one penny if you remember the office space in
2704600	2709200	Belgium that scenario was based upon taking the money less than one cent off every transaction
2709200	2717840	and adding them up so in that case and if you are using pure terminology a microtransaction
2717840	2724360	would have to consist of less of one one thousandth of a penny so therefore the term microtransaction
2724360	2728620	is actually an incorrect term I was right I'm not gonna have this stupid argument again
2728620	2735920	I just well that's my whole thing that I hate about modern language use is this whole let's
2735920	2742520	just completely define everything but use really well ROTFL no that's not what I'm talking
2742520	2756100	about pre-boarding you know putting unnecessary prefixes towards George Carlin did point that
2756100	2761420	out didn't he but but then again there's also literal and you know applied means of things
2761420	2767080	for example micro machines were not one thousandth the size of a car actually I think that they
2767080	2773560	were they were smaller okay I think that they were one thousand one thousand whatever shit
2773560	2778120	there was smaller okay that's all that matters no one's gonna do the fucking scale shit it's
2778120	2783980	not model building okay no fucking train sets here would you say this compares to how it
2783980	2789120	works there's an item on the menu called the cheese quesadilla when it quesadilla literally
2789120	2793400	means you know cheese so it's like you're ordering it it's like you're ordering a peanut
2793400	2798440	peanut butter sandwich or something I you're ordering a cheese cheese sandwich like ordering
2798440	2806220	chai tea because chai means tea so you know I think that it's more or less you everybody
2806220	2811220	in the world is stupid let's accommodate the language to everybody's stupidity I don't
2811220	2813620	like to... I do not like to live in the real world.
2813620	2816700	Here's the Poltergeist again. Suddenly we're the language podcast tonight.
2816700	2819860	No, that's all right. It's all good.
2819860	2823580	I just honestly think that it's a reflection of society.
2823580	2827780	Don't sign on to Xbox Live and listen to the way people talk because you will weep
2827780	2831140	on behalf of society. Chris, stop distracting.
2831140	2834380	Stop distracting Jamie while she's trying to read the mailbag.
2834380	2840220	I love that site. She did though, she did show me the one I have in my cubicle
2840220	2844060	with a picture of Captain Kirk saying, James T. Kirk. I'm sorry, I can't hear you
2844060	2845340	over the sound of how awesome I am.
2845340	2849900	Emails. Okay. This one comes from One Night Stands.
2849900	2854700	Hello, I just recently started to listen to your podcast and I must say that I really like
2854700	2855980	them as they don't bore me
2855980	2861380	except for the Onion audio and video podcast. A few times on the show, Skye, I think,
2861380	2864140	I'm still trying to figure out the difference between the two guys,
2864140	2868100	has mentioned that he's gay. The first time I thought he was just...
2868100	2873820	What? Nothing. Okay. The first time, I just thought he was just joking and then I was listening to your most
2873820	2874680	recent one where
2874680	2878020	Skye and Jamie went to the movies and started talking about the sanctity of
2878020	2881220	marriage and then running off to Vegas to get married to immediately divorce.
2881220	2885940	It's just something about being gay. And I know it's tacky to dig into other people's
2885940	2888100	lives and find out what their sexual orientation is.
2888100	2891580	I long for the days when people like Perez Hilton were branded with a
2891580	2893700	scarlet letter, probably G for gossip,
2893700	2896860	and I'd been wondering, are you gay? I res... No.
2896860	2901380	No. Rob is... I'm very happy to be on this program.
2901380	2905700	I think that it's great to hear that one of the three main people is. As a gay
2905700	2907360	gamer, I think it's great to hear.
2907360	2910900	It's great to see celebrities being out and proud and know the fan base is not
2910900	2913980	swayed by their sexual preference. Skye, DarkSakuraLoki, keep up the good work.
2913980	2917100	Is that person insinuating I'm a celebrity? Rad!
2917100	2920500	Ooh, ego plus plus. And I look forward to
2920500	2925100	hearing your next podcast. Thank you. P.S. my handle is a Simpsons reference.
2925100	2928540	Everyone thinks it's a sex thing. Wow.
2928540	2932020	It's One Night Stands. One Night Stands.
2932020	2935180	Now that... usually that's what you'd find on gay.com, One Night Stands.
2935180	2938540	Yeah, no, I'm Skye, the voice you hear right now is... or Rob.
2938540	2942180	I don't really... not a lot of people call me Skye anymore, but Rob. And yeah, I'm gay.
2942180	2945060	So, but that's not what the show's all about. The show's about video games. But I
2945060	2945620	understand.
2945620	2949340	I totally understand where you're coming from. Because sometimes I can kind of
2949340	2949800	speak
2949800	2954280	from experience. It's kinda hard to find. Gay gamers are in an interesting niche, I
2954280	2955340	think, because in
2955340	2959940	gaming culture, you know, obviously thanks to the Xbox Lives of the world where, you
2959940	2961380	know, fag, fag, fag.
2961380	2965580	You know, literally, I wear pink armor in Halo, okay? Because I think it's funny.
2965580	2966420	It has...
2966420	2971320	Lightest red. I wear it because I think it's funny and nobody else wears pink.
2971320	2975580	I stand out. But, you know, somebody goes, oh, I just got killed by the fag in pink
2975580	2976140	armor.
2976140	2980300	Click, click, mute, warn. Love Halo 3. It's cause Rob is an attention whore.
2980300	2984100	But, well, and then in the other side of it. So you have the gaming culture,
2984100	2988360	you know, frowns on gays. To some extent. Obviously not everybody.
2988360	2991940	It's a few bad apples ruining the barrel. But then you have in gay culture,
2991940	2996460	you know, like, oh, you mean you don't shop at, you know, Nordstrom's and you don't
2996460	3000660	listen to Madonna? And why don't you go to the club with us? Why do you have to stay home and play games?
3000660	3005700	Come on, let's go out, you know. Let's go get Madonna tickets for $250.
3005700	3009740	And, you know, let's do crack. I don't know, you know, it's like...
3009740	3016740	I'm not saying all gays are like that. But, unfortunately, you know, I felt
3016860	3020660	that kind of judgment from some of those very superficial people that, you know,
3020660	3022260	oh, you play games? That's like a,
3022260	3025620	you know, that's a little kid thing. That's not a gay thing. Well, you know, who's to say?
3025620	3027500	What is, what, you know, people
3027500	3030820	like what they like. So, anyway, you know, and I don't
3030820	3034740	like to usually advertise the fact I'm gay on the program because this is not the,
3034740	3037980	oh my god, the really big gay podcast about video games.
3037980	3044140	Okay, guys, I cannot wait to review Gears of War because that is hot.
3044140	3047660	No, you missed Rob singing show tunes last week.
3047660	3051060	We already busted out the show tunes last week. But, no, in all seriousness,
3051060	3054820	again, it's just that, you know, it is what it is.
3054820	3058860	I'm gay, but I also... I've been playing video games
3058860	3062100	a lot longer than I've been dating men. Let's put it that way,
3062100	3065220	I guess. I don't know. Yes, and Chris is a lesbian.
3065220	3068700	Yes. I'm a very big dyke. Dyke,
3068700	3073020	power, yo. I like boobies. But, most of all,
3073020	3076420	we like games, so that's what it really boils down to.
3076420	3082100	And boobies. I like boobies, too, so that's, I guess, something every... I think it's a unanimous vote in this room that boobies are great.
3082100	3083180	Boobies, yes.
3083180	3086980	All right, all in favor of boobies? Aye. All opposed?
3086980	3091620	I was too late on the, I was too late on the four
3091620	3095780	boobies. All right. The Pokemon does not like boobies.
3095780	3099460	So, I don't know what else to say to that email, but,
3099460	3103700	okay, I think it's... I'm gonna have to tell William that somebody couldn't figure it out.
3103700	3107540	What? I'm kidding. Here's the thing, though.
3107540	3111700	Perez Hilton totally sold out. Like, he used to be cool, like, a year ago, but
3111700	3112820	totally sold out.
3112820	3116500	You gotta find some new blogs to read, dude. Sorry. Perez Hilton kinda sold out.
3116500	3119820	Drawing coke coming out of people's noses isn't funny anymore, sorry to say.
3119820	3123900	Yeah, that website. The Gossip Blogger.
3123900	3127180	Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Anyway, sorry.
3127180	3130580	Next email. Next email. Hey, okay, good God, this is such
3130580	3134380	awful spelling. I'm sorry, whoever you are.
3134380	3138420	I'm sorry. One more thing on the gay thing, because I forgot to mention this. Praise
3138420	3142420	and happy thoughts and thank yous to the folks who make websites
3142420	3147460	for the minorities in whatever cultures. In this case, I'm talking
3147460	3150740	gay gamers, but whatever cultures, to come together. So specifically, I'm talking
3150740	3151980	like gaygamer.net,
3151980	3155300	I'm talking the gamers experimentation forums, and all those other little niche places on the
3155300	3155740	internet
3155740	3158900	for, you know, people that feel like, you know, like,
3158900	3162780	gosh, I feel like abnormal because
3162780	3166300	I like games and I'm gay and the two don't go together. It's like oil and
3166300	3166820	water.
3166820	3171420	Praise to those people that make the niches on the internet for those
3171420	3172700	kind of people to find each other.
3172700	3176460	And I'm just talking in general, too. Not just gay and gaming, but all types of
3176460	3180100	minorities. So, hooray.
3180100	3183540	Now we can move on. Hey OrangeLunch, I'm kinda a new listener, but I already say
3183540	3184500	you guys rock.
3184500	3188380	I do have a question. You talk about Final Fantasy a lot, but I've never heard
3188380	3190260	you talk about Final Fantasy X.
3190260	3193860	Is there a reason, as I've been playing it a lot recently, this is from
3193860	3198260	Lycan. Wait, am I on crack or wasn't there an email last week where we talked about Final Fantasy X?
3198260	3202140	I swear to God it came up like last week or two weeks ago. I think we did talk about Final Fantasy X.
3202140	3205140	Maybe this person's behind in their podcast listening, so we'll give them a
3205140	3205860	bye, but
3205860	3209940	that and Final Fantasy X's fucking old.
3209940	3213380	I mean, if we're on Final Fantasy XII now, no seriously,
3213380	3216780	played that game like years ago. It was an awesome game,
3216780	3219780	but it was years ago. 10-2, not so great.
3219780	3222860	The fandom has it, they're still on 8.
3222860	3226620	Oh my God, the fandom for X. The fandom for X, I mean,
3226620	3231620	you go to any, you know, anime convention guaranteed you're gonna see
3231620	3234780	a tubby Yuna somewhere, always.
3234780	3238220	Always. So the fandom is never gonna die.
3238220	3241660	And then, you know, a Waka with a pooch, you know.
3241660	3248140	You know what really bothers me is the pregnant fetish fan art.
3248140	3251940	What? It's on DeviantArt, all over DeviantArt.
3251940	3255620	Okay, when I talked about the whole, like, minority
3255620	3259500	subculture thing, maybe there are a few exceptions.
3259500	3262740	Yeah, they have a big, big subculture
3262740	3266100	of people who like, what is it, inflated
3266100	3269540	art? Where basically they make girls, it's mostly girls.
3269540	3273540	With boobs that are three times the size of their bodies? Exactly, and they're like,
3273540	3277380	they're big, they're fat, like, way more physically than
3277380	3280660	they should be. Like in any way, shape, or form. It's not physical, it's not physically
3280660	3282140	possible for these people to breathe.
3282140	3285660	You know, I think I need to rethink my argument on the counterculture thing.
3285660	3287900	Maybe I need to rethink those kudos a little bit.
3287900	3292540	I'm so hypocritical because I'm so sad, like, I sit there and I go,
3292540	3295700	you know, I don't care what they, it's like, I don't have to look at that art,
3295700	3298740	but then I see it on the favorites page, and I just go,
3298740	3302860	that shit should not be here! Because it's so fucking,
3302860	3306940	you know, most of it is really bad, too. Like, these people can't draw, but the only reason
3306940	3310540	that it ends up on the favorite page is because some,
3310540	3313580	there's a bunch of morons out there who are wanking to this,
3313580	3317620	and it's disgusting. Are you sure they just aren't out of proportion just because they are bad
3317620	3318140	artists?
3318140	3321740	You know, sometimes I wonder, like, they accidentally got it really big.
3321740	3325260	No, they draw fat very well. Yeah, I can show you.
3325260	3328420	It's really disgusting. Yeah, I can draw fat. It's a circle
3328420	3331780	with a stick for leg, stick for arm, stick for neck,
3331780	3335980	circle for head. Oh, like the chicken Willy Wonka when she ate the blueberry thing.
3335980	3340180	Yeah, okay.
3340180	3344740	Next email, please.
3344740	3349180	From Final Fantasy X to Snozberries, look, you're going to ask us a question like that, that's what
3349180	3349780	you're going to get.
3349780	3353020	Hey, O-L-R. What do you think of Final Fantasy X? Snozberries.
3353020	3356660	Hey, O-L-R, it's Nintendo Maniac 64.
3356660	3361220	I noticed something this week with the update for Kirby's Final Smash on the Smash
3361220	3362140	Bros. Brawl site.
3362140	3365380	If you compare the bottom of the Japanese webpage to the English or any other
3365380	3366180	language page,
3366180	3370740	you notice that the Japanese version has some kind of extra sound clip recording.
3370740	3373860	Any idea what this might be? Unfortunately,
3373860	3376940	Rob's computer is the primary. We cannot
3376940	3381100	correctly answer this question. So, next! But I will hypothesize,
3381100	3384100	since they're saying it's an audio thing, right? I will hypothesize.
3384100	3388020	Perhaps it is a piece of work that has not been translated
3388020	3392180	or brought over yet, or simply it was just an oversight. If it's Kirby, why would it have any
3392180	3395740	words to it? I guess that's true. I think it's just an oversight then.
3395740	3399100	I think you're being a little tinfoil hat-ish. I wouldn't worry just yet.
3399100	3402700	I think it's just an oversight, so don't worry.
3402700	3409100	Oh my God! What the hell
3409100	3413100	is that?
3413100	3416800	There's a picture on DeviantArt and it's on the
3416800	3420340	favorites page, and it's actually a lot better than the most of the stuff. At least
3420340	3423260	this girl is somewhat in proportion, but Jesus Christ.
3423260	3428860	She looks like a walrus. She looks like she's about ready to go goo goo ka choo,
3428860	3431780	okay, for one. Okay, for B,
3431780	3435340	did you ever see, and this is great radio, by the way, because I'm responding to a picture
3435340	3438900	for B, and I'm totally being a hypocrite right now with this whole thing that I said,
3438900	3440500	you know, oh, the countercultures are great.
3440500	3443940	Not this! Everything I said earlier, this
3443940	3447420	is not a part of that. Do not want, exactly.
3447420	3452180	Here's the thing, like, did you ever see that faces of death where the guy had
3452180	3453620	elephantitis of the balls?
3453620	3457820	That's what her tits look like. What?
3457820	3462660	What web site? Is it DeviantArt?
3462660	3466340	You want to have a fun time? Go to deviantart.com
3466340	3471780	and in the search, type inflation and just watch the funny shit happen. I
3471780	3472660	swear
3472660	3477380	it's just like people that should not be. It looks like a bunch of
3477380	3482060	freaking world record tumors, like I saw on Ripley's Believe It or Not. Or you know what?
3482060	3486100	Or you know what? Don't, and go play video games instead.
3486100	3489660	You'll thank us later. Sorry, oh no.
3489660	3495660	That can't be real. It's like somebody's Halloween costumes. Now that's funny, if you see that.
3495660	3499380	It looks like she has like
3499380	3503380	beach balls for titties.
3503380	3508220	Next email please. Do not want. Hey guys, I love the show. Just want to know if you've seen
3508220	3510500	the masterpiece that is Dead Fantasy 1.
3510500	3515860	Not check it out now. Congrats on another milestone. 250 is certainly an
3515860	3517780	accomplishment for independent podcast.
3517780	3521220	Pat yourselves on the ass. Thanks for reading this.
3521220	3524980	Yeah, we did. That's from Rissimo. I know, I've seen it.
3524980	3528740	Was it Tomonobu? No, that's
3528740	3532460	not who did it. Who did it? Monty Oum is the guy that does
3532460	3536780	those. And it's actually, it's really cool. You should check it out. Dead Fantasy and
3536780	3537740	also Haloid.
3537740	3541460	It is pretty neat. And then he has another one too, if you go to his DeviantArt page.
3541460	3544860	He doesn't have any inflation pictures, unfortunately.
3544860	3549620	He has some really kick ass stuff though. Like they have a picture of like Cloud as a chick
3549620	3554460	on a bike. And it looks really good. But definitely check out like you know the
3554460	3557020	Haloid and Dead Fantasy stuff. I'll have to show it
3557020	3560260	in studio after the show. But it's
3560260	3564740	seriously some kick ass wire food shit that's a lot of
3564740	3568340	borrowed heavily from the Matrix. But really awesome. Check it out.
3568340	3573740	That's it for the emails. How about something that has nothing to do with
3573740	3574980	inflation? Chris,
3574980	3578060	put the inflation away. I seriously,
3578060	3581660	although seriously like part of me wants to like make the album art for Orange
3581660	3583560	Lounge Radio this week. One of those pictures.
3583560	3588020	If there weren't copyright issues I'd totally do it. But anyway, let's
3588020	3591140	let's move on. Shout, Chris. I'm not looking at inflation.
3591140	3594740	It's his fault. Alright, moving on. Loki, it's your turn.
3594740	3598700	Anyway, let's get this
3598700	3601980	train back in the tracks here.
3601980	3605940	Anyways, Games for Windows Live is getting an update
3605940	3609660	in November as well. Of course you know normally Xbox Live does their
3609660	3613300	spring and fall updates. So it sounds around the time
3613300	3616300	we'll be seeing an update for Live as well on 360.
3616300	3619300	But Games for Windows Live will become 1.2.
3619300	3622740	And with that there's going to be some improvements to
3622740	3626100	actually some of the features that they have on there including new languages.
3626100	3629900	Now with Dutch. Twelve new gamer pics
3629900	3634860	and a network information viewer. So you can provide a simpler way to
3634860	3638180	troubleshoot connectivity issues and stuff like that.
3638180	3641900	So that's pretty cool. And
3641900	3645140	it looks like best of all the internet connection
3645140	3648860	they're saying that they're going to have offline achievements. So if your
3648860	3650260	internet connection is down
3650260	3653260	you can do that just like you can on normal 360.
3653260	3659980	Awesome!
3659980	3664580	Alrighty, well Prince of Persia is also going to be getting an update of their
3664580	3667300	own except kind of in the other way. They're going backwards.
3667300	3671180	But that's not a bad thing because it's actually a prequel trilogy
3671180	3674220	for the Prince of Persia games. Of course these games are very popular.
3674220	3677180	However, this is
3677180	3681180	a rumor so take it with a grain of salt.
3681180	3684860	But I could totally see something like this happening. I don't know. But anyway,
3684860	3690020	supposedly some early images have leaked from this. It's called Ghosts of the Pass.
3690020	3693260	It's supposed to be coming out the second half of next year.
3693260	3696580	And according to the site this originally ran on, quote,
3696580	3700220	it's stylistically and gameplay wise the game has abandoned the dark edginess of the
3700220	3701080	last two titles
3701080	3704820	in favor of a fantastical cross between the sands of time
3704820	3709580	Ico and Zelda. I don't know. When you put it that way it sounds a little fanboyish to me.
3709580	3713060	At the same time though that's about the time I think that the Prince of Persia movies are
3713060	3714580	supposed to be coming out as well.
3714580	3718260	I mean obviously the Prince of Persia series is not a dead series.
3718260	3721540	So big fat duh that there's another game coming out.
3721540	3725540	But is it a prequel? That could be interesting.
3725540	3728580	And who knows? Maybe it's actually the movie version because maybe they're
3728580	3730220	going in a different direction with the movie. Maybe it
3730220	3733540	isn't based on existing storyline and these games are there to support the movie.
3733540	3736940	Who knows? Theories abound everywhere.
3736940	3740940	But we don't know for sure until next year.
3740940	3746780	Well, this is fairly interesting as far as something that may or may not be.
3746780	3752660	But one of the SNKs, to me one of the games that I like the best from them,
3752660	3755980	Magician Lord, has an ESRB rating.
3755980	3760020	So it most likely will not be
3760020	3763940	only for Japan. We could see it coming out on
3763940	3767020	the Virtual Console for Wii very soon.
3767020	3770540	That's what I gotta say about that.
3770540	3774100	Basically you go through all these different levels that you can
3774100	3777540	turn your character into different types of
3777540	3780740	I guess elemental type characters.
3780740	3784340	So it's a pretty good game. Magician Lord is pretty hardcore awesome.
3784340	3787620	Cool.
3787620	3791860	Anyways, other sorts of awesome.
3791860	3795740	There was before a problem with the Bioshock PC version.
3795740	3798740	Of course people getting pissed off that you can only
3798740	3802700	have three different activations available for that. Well now they have
3802700	3806180	a brand new tool that's been released officially.
3806180	3811700	It's a activation revoke tool and will allow you to revoke some of the
3811700	3816180	activations that you have so that if you want to install on different PC
3816180	3821380	you can do that. It's basically allow you to race and reload copies of
3821380	3824300	Bioshock onto your PC as many times as you want
3824300	3828900	without using up one of your activation tokens provided you don't make any major
3828900	3831140	changes to your current hardware.
3831140	3834540	And of course the tool is downloadable on the Cult
3834540	3837460	of Rapture website.
3837460	3841740	Awesome. At least they're trying to fix some stuff. Well this is the part of the show
3841740	3844620	where we would have opened it up to the Skype line to take some phone calls at
3844620	3847300	1-877-GAME-OLR but unfortunately
3847300	3850340	the system is down. The system is down.
3850340	3856180	So unfortunately live radio you know if we were a tape show we could you know
3856180	3857660	futz with it and
3857660	3860380	put a band-aid on it and make it look like nothing ever happened but
3860380	3863140	unfortunately we're live and the tape still rolling from when we were
3863140	3864060	connected to
3864060	3867140	Live 365 and everybody was here in chat so
3867140	3870620	sadly we're gonna have to forego the Skype line tonight. However I just want to
3870620	3874180	remind folks they can call anytime because we often get emails from folks that say
3874180	3874620	you know
3874620	3878060	hey I want to call in sometime but you know I'm just not around on Sunday
3878060	3879180	nights it's a bad time for me.
3879180	3883060	Don't forget we have voicemail there at 1-877-GAME-OLR so if you wanted to call
3883060	3883580	in tonight
3883580	3886800	call in and leave a voicemail and we'll try to play it on next week's show.
3886800	3889580	The only reason we haven't been playing voicemails lately is because we haven't been getting a
3889580	3889940	lot
3889940	3893700	but if we get some good ones we'll definitely play them. Just my only advice try to just
3893700	3896420	you know keep it under two minutes because when you go on and ramble and
3896420	3898380	ramble it makes us want to play it less because you know
3898380	3902180	the show is for us to ramble and ramble. No. We want you guys to definitely have a say as
3902180	3904280	well so the Skype line is there or our email
3904280	3908740	mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and apologies to our live listeners who got
3908740	3913420	cut off tonight. What can I say? The show was just all kinds of broken tonight.
3913420	3917580	It's like this whole year old now quit curse. I don't know what else to say
3917580	3920380	but we will go around and get some last minute stories of which I'm sure Loki's
3920380	3921100	gotta have some.
3921100	3925460	Yeah. What's up? Anyways let's see here there's some interesting pictures coming
3925460	3927340	out from Postal 3
3927340	3931860	one of which features a new gun apparently that's going to be in the
3931860	3932540	game
3932540	3937220	which features a guy's hand up a badger's ass
3937220	3940700	and he's firing a badger gun apparently
3940700	3944300	it's like laser badger or something like that so this is
3944300	3947540	and I gotta show this in in studio here real quick
3947540	3950700	Well you don't have to. Yes I do. Destructoid
3950700	3954260	ran a little interview based on that and I gotta say
3954260	3958580	I was already gonna buy this game I'm thinking I may buy two copies of this game
3958580	3959100	because it's
3959100	3963940	it's fucking awesome looking so
3963940	3969140	go runny with scissors you know I gotta respect. Yeah well they'll be on the badger's ass.
3969140	3972780	Hey I gotta respect the fact that they leave
3972780	3976860	nothing to chance as far as offending people. Good luck getting this past the
3976860	3979100	ESRB though that's all I gotta say.
3979100	3984500	Other fun stuff there's gonna be a new tool that's
3984500	3987700	I can't hold on I just have to say I can't wait for the YouTube where
3987700	3989740	somebody's gonna film themselves doing this to the
3989740	3993620	badger badger badger badger badger badger badger badger mushroom
3993620	3998300	like seriously let's take some over-unders on how long before those
3998300	3999220	YouTube show up
3999220	4003380	I say they show up before the game now that I've said that
4003380	4006700	somebody's gonna take that picture and put it on YouTube. Send us the link when you get it done.
4006700	4010300	Now also a max console has
4010300	4014660	some pictures up of a brand new device it's an adapter to let you use
4014660	4018620	HDMI inputs on your first generation
4018620	4022380	Xbox 360 of course the ones without HDMI
4022380	4026380	and this is from the XCM 1080i
4026380	4030460	HDMI and it's shaped like a disc and it plugs into the back of
4030460	4034500	your 360 where the normal AV stuff goes
4034500	4039740	and we'll do HDMI out and we'll also do DVI out so that's pretty fucking awesome
4039740	4044860	that's gonna be available. The other thing there's a Phantom Hourglass DS
4044860	4047820	bundle that's appeared on internet retail sites
4047820	4052420	this is for the UK so it's a nice silver color with
4052420	4055500	looks like some silkscreens of
4055500	4060340	Zelda from Phantom Hourglass and also the
4060340	4063580	Zelda Phantom Hourglass logo so that's kinda neat
4063580	4068340	and that's probably coming soon and also if you are pre-ordering Super Mario
4068340	4070180	Galaxy and you want a free
4070180	4074460	pre-order coin just make sure you pre-order your copies at Amazon Circuit
4074460	4075420	City, Fred Meyers,
4075420	4079060	Fry's Electronics, GameCrazyGameStop, Kmart
4079060	4082420	and many others
4082420	4085740	pretty much every single store out there so
4085740	4089260	yeah that's awesome and
4089260	4093340	finally and I'm sure you're gonna hear this about the time that
4093340	4097100	this podcast is released some wonderful information which
4097100	4100140	you know was gonna be for our live listeners but since they're not with us
4100140	4103660	I'll just save it for the part B
4103660	4107060	there is each year
4107060	4111180	the ESA does kind of a I guess a
4111180	4115740	charity drive with games last year
4115740	4120460	Sony got together and put some games a PlayStation 2 collection
4120460	4125260	together with a couple games now and this will be announced officially on
4125260	4130380	Tuesday and it's actually what's gonna be is three games
4130380	4134540	Robbie Bach of the ESA will announce the holiday bundle it's gonna feature three
4134540	4136580	Xbox 360 games including
4136580	4143580	Cars Open Season and Fusion Frenzy 2 all for $29.99
4144740	4148140	and the proceeds will go to
4148140	4151780	you know basically helping the ESA
4151780	4156620	and I guess that's kinda neat last year their goal is basically to
4156620	4160260	deliver two million dollars to the ESA charity
4160260	4163500	and all the game publisher or let me just quote this right here
4163500	4167940	each year the ESA partners with key industry gaming platforms to create a
4167940	4171340	three game hard bundle which is
4171340	4175860	specially packaged with the messaging about the ESA and its charity status and
4175860	4177020	sold through retail
4177020	4181940	to deliver this program the game publishers unite together to work
4181940	4183340	through issues around
4183340	4188340	issues such as waiving royalties packaging costs etc. in order to maximize
4188340	4190140	charitable contribution last year Sony
4190140	4193940	delivered a bundle for the ESA and this year Microsoft has agreed to create a
4193940	4195900	three-game bundle to sell a retail
4195900	4198660	with the proceeds going to the ESA charity so
4198660	4203580	awesome then you'll probably see that in stores on the 23rd
4203580	4206900	alright well
4206900	4210540	I guess that's it for the show unfortunately our stream never came back
4210540	4211500	up so
4211500	4214740	if one of you that's still in chat DarkSakura I don't know just let them know unfortunately
4214740	4215760	we've wrapped the show
4215760	4218900	and unfortunately I'll just have to come back next week or download the show on Tuesday
4218900	4220420	but we thank them for sticking out
4220420	4223100	any of those folks that were still around hoping we'd come back up but
4223100	4224300	unfortunately the
4224300	4227220	computer screwed up and now I have this dialogue box on my screen that will not
4227220	4228420	go away this is just
4228420	4233620	oh my god somebody put a gun in this computer it's done
4233620	4238660	alright so we're gonna go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thoughts and
4238660	4243380	wrap up tonight's broken show. It doesn't seem like the first show after a major landmark
4243380	4246140	show is always like really broken like I seem to remember 201 was really screwed
4246140	4248940	there's the craptacular artwork for it
4248940	4252540	too bad Fusion Frenzy 2 is shit
4252540	4256020	too bad all those games are shit
4256020	4259420	alright anyhow let's go around and get everybody's final thought Chris thank you
4259420	4262740	very much for being here even if now you think you're some type of bad luck charm
4262740	4265860	but I don't care we still love having you here and come back
4265860	4269060	dammit I am and I didn't tell you I'm going to Disneyland next week
4269060	4273180	so I'll be thinking of you. Whore. No. Get lots of pictures on the teacups
4273180	4278940	I will. Me and Xtaphir are going. Aww that would be fun. He hasn't been in a long long time so I'm
4278940	4281820	gonna make him go on that ferris wheel that sways back and forth he's gonna cry
4281820	4285620	it'll be fun. Yeah I won't go on that but yeah I'm you're probably gonna see a lot
4285620	4285980	more
4285980	4289340	me until until March because I'm gonna be moving out there
4289340	4292860	and hopefully you'll be able to hear me on my podcast
4292860	4297220	Oh! Which just goes to further prove
4297220	4301300	everybody has a freaking podcast. Exactly. We were first god dammit
4301300	4305740	Alright thank you very much for being here. You're welcome. Puppy thanks for coming back
4305740	4308980	and I'm glad you got to talk more this week even if
4308980	4313340	sorta even though there was like like only two microphones but you know what
4313340	4314220	can you do? More chaos.
4314220	4317700	It's like your shirt says, Booched. Yes. The show is Booched
4317700	4322660	Is that a Puzzle Pirates thing? Yes it is a Puzzle Pirates thing. Wow what does Booched mean?
4322660	4327140	You screwed up? Yeah that's basically what it means. This is like the worst rating you get on a
4327140	4327860	puzzle if you
4327860	4333180	Oh okay well that was a very appropriate shirt to wear to the show
4333180	4336900	I have to see there was another article I was reading on
4336900	4340180	Destructoid that they had is this game called
4340180	4344180	Animal Kaiser and it's basically where you can pit different animals against each other
4344180	4347260	in like deathmatch in the arcade so they have
4347260	4350540	snake versus Black Panther and Indian Cobra
4350540	4354580	and it's awesome because you can just pick all sorts of different animals to fight each
4354580	4354980	other
4354980	4358380	I swear to God just pick a black mumble you'll want every time
4358380	4362540	I swear to God there's like an entire video game craze that is just dead set
4362540	4363980	on pissing Peeta off
4363980	4368220	And as far as I'm concerned, have at em. Peeta can kiss my ass
4368220	4371820	Hey Peeta came back with Super Chick Sisters or whatever that was it was
4371820	4372900	actually kinda cute
4372900	4375900	I gotta say all things but that was again I'm
4375900	4377220	I'm visiting
4377220	4380900	Oh my god. Now what?
4380900	4385220	Loki, this will double as your final thought
4385220	4389500	They have a shark versus a lion
4389500	4393500	That's the coolest shit I've ever seen
4393500	4398260	I gotta see this here. They've got to have this in the United States
4398260	4401140	I know this is one of those quirky, okay
4401140	4404700	We need to see
4404700	4411220	Sorry I gotta...
4411220	4414340	This is on YouTube? Animal Kaiser
4414340	4418060	There's a shark and a freaking lion
4418060	4422180	The lion and the shark is out of water
4422180	4425380	and it's kicking the lion's ass. How is that possible?
4425380	4430220	The fucking shark won! If this is why Smash Brothers got delayed then I'm okay with it
4430220	4434820	Seriously, the new third-party characters being announced
4434820	4439020	Shark and lion
4439020	4443860	DarkSakura, your final thought. First of all, everyone's still PMing me
4443860	4447180	on a chat
4447180	4450500	My final thought is
4450500	4454980	bitches. Alright. They're referring to work
4454980	4458340	And my final thought is sorry the show is broken tonight
4458340	4462420	and you get what you pay for. But thank you anyway. Thank you. What?
4462420	4466660	What do you mean I'm doing it wrong?
4466660	4470220	Can we just stop the show now?
4470220	4474060	Thank you very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and
4474060	4476620	independent radio even when it's as screwed up as this
4476620	4479860	If you like what you hear since we do this for free
4479860	4483580	tell friends about the program, tell enemies about the program. Leave us a five
4483580	4484860	star review on iTunes
4484860	4487940	Post us in your signature, I don't know, whatever. Just spread the word
4487940	4491860	We need it. Thank you guys very much. We'll see you next week and hopefully
4491860	4495540	things will be in working order and not booched
4495540	4524780	Have a good week.
4525540	4527620	you
