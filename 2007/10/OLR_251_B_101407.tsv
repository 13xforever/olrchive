15296	19080	and now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
32152	33813	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
60971	63152	I think it's around the same time as the Euro version.
63653	67434	Anyway, same issues with the European model.
67494	69475	It's not going to have backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2.
69695	72056	And I stand corrected from what I said last week.
72396	74937	I was a little confused with the chips and what they did and shit.
75378	81160	So, originally they had taken out the Emotion Engine, which dropped the backwards compatibility a little bit.
81180	85102	Now they removed the second chip that did the rest of the backwards compatibility for PlayStation 2.
85142	85262	So...
86465	87465	It's not a software thing.
87505	88906	It is something that they're doing to save money.
88926	89706	It's still stupid, though.
90147	94309	They took out one of the biggest marketing things they had.
94709	97590	I mean, they were totally doing it around that emotion.
97610	99231	You don't have to buy that version.
99271	107975	You can spend $100 more and buy one that does play some... Basically, they removed its soul, or my soul, depending on how you want to look at it.
108635	113037	But hey, that's okay, because you'll buy a 40-gig PS3 if you're in Japan, because they're wiped.
115658	117059	And that makes all the difference.
117119	120401	They're available in white, as well as black.
120961	122622	Any chance we might get the other colors over here?
124364	126745	Or do they say, well, are they going to be all Nintendo?
127086	132950	We don't need to do different colors right now, even though we always do different colors, because the current consoles are still selling like crazy.
133070	135492	We don't want to confuse people anymore, you know.
136452	136813	I don't know.
137193	141076	Eventually, I'm sure there'll be different console colors, much like there is with the PS2.
141874	147200	But PS2, they stuck with black for a long time until silver, which I think that was just this summer.
147280	148181	So, I mean, shit.
149442	152385	They're a little late to the game with the colors for the PS2 as well.
152946	158451	Going to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, GS68 says, White PS3s?
158832	159693	I call racism.
160393	164378	Did anybody else do that ad?
164638	164738	What?
165237	167098	Oh, you guys already probably covered it.
167138	171220	It just reminded me of that ad for, I think, a PSP in Japan.
171620	172881	That was a long time ago.
173161	174221	It just reminded me of it.
174442	175142	That white chick.
175902	181005	Chris the Lesbian, taking us back to the sounds of 2006 here on Orange Lounge Radio.
181405	181805	Love you, Chris.
182806	183206	Bite me.
185447	189389	Okay, so we know Sony has these white and black issues.
191167	192047	Why not red?
192647	196469	Where's the red love and the yellow love and the blue love and the purple love, huh?
196589	196949	Where is it?
196969	198089	Native American love.
198809	200850	Well, you aren't going to get any love.
202350	203871	You see those extra colors?
204111	205091	That costs money.
205531	207292	And obviously they're trying to save money.
207964	208904	Actually, I take it back.
208984	210345	There is a red PlayStation 3.
210985	216867	I think they made like three of them because I seem to remember some Canadian contest where they were giving away like red PS3s in Canada.
217007	219688	Or you can go on the internet and buy them in any color.
219788	221929	Or you can go to Target and get a can of spray paint.
223329	223989	Just be careful.
224009	224770	That's a Krylon touch.
227431	230111	But I have to have one that matches my carpet.
230131	231772	You don't have any carpet.
232532	233613	I'm being hypothetical.
234253	234533	All right.
235217	242299	Anyhow, speaking of the Sony PSP, at least Chris was able to take us on the right path and take us over to the PSP.
242919	248201	And we want to talk about some first-party PSP titles that are coming in the year 2008.
248881	252802	There's going to be seven first-party download titles coming to the PSP.
253102	253703	Now, how does that work?
253723	256223	Because I haven't downloaded anything on the PSP yet.
256523	257264	I haven't either.
257844	258104	Okay.
260376	264620	Well, I guess you take your PSP, connect to the Sony store, and you can download all of these.
264660	268083	It's eventually going to be with the Sony store on PC or on the PS3.
268444	271667	You just download it, and you transfer it to the memory stick.
274069	281376	Hopefully it's a lot better than the stupid demos, because the demos you have to put in this fucking specific directory, and they have all these specific instructions.
281436	284859	Instead of, throw it in the games folder, and it will work.
285179	286080	You know, something like that.
286676	291019	Well, there's going to be three action games, two music games, one shooter, and one racer.
291419	293961	But if you were hoping I was going to name those seven titles, sorry.
294001	296282	That story's in another castle.
296322	297383	You know, sorry.
298183	307750	This kind of brings me back to that WiiWare story that we did in Part A. But I remember there was also a Hudson karaoke game that's come in the WiiWare.
308990	309891	Hudson's cool.
311312	312293	Bomberman karaoke.
312473	315715	As long as I can sing Fergalicious...
317089	319973	No, that's okay.
320294	320875	No one can hear you.
322397	331149	So... So a new demo was announced for the PS3 store, which is Ratchet & Clank Tools of Destruction.
332210	332311	Um...
334381	348005	Also, I think out for demo is NHL 2K8 and Conan, but Sony's recent update was also saying that they were also going to be putting up demos for Uncharted, Folklore, and Fallout 3.
351866	353227	Demos, demos, demos.
353647	354747	Finally.
354767	355027	Alright.
356168	356668	Demos.
356688	357088	Demos.
358038	360140	When did EA become a contestant on Supermarket Sweep?
376624	377805	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
402659	406602	But who knows, Mass Effect 2, definitely going to be published by EA.
407603	407883	I don't know.
409705	411346	So it's very interesting.
413167	415209	Why do you think EA is trying to buy all these companies?
415249	416050	What's their strategy?
416090	417631	Is it just like a Monopoly type thing?
417711	424016	Or are they just trying to grab the, I mean, because BioWare doing Mass Effect, I mean, are they just trying to foresee that, oh, this is going to be a huge title, we want part of that?
424056	429380	Because Activision is bizarre, so, you know, they got a monkey see monkey do, I don't know.
431112	435595	Activision in like EA or in this pissing contest to who can make the best games.
437757	440579	Hint to Activision, stay away from Spider-Man games.
440979	442400	Not doing very good for you.
446162	452367	Sorry, I was looking up on YouTube some clips of Supermarket Suite, but I guess I wanted you all in the studio to know I'm not crazy.
452407	456470	This was a real badass TV show they used to have on the telly.
456830	457030	Do you?
457782	461285	My granny used to watch it, and I'd have to watch it when I went to Dothan.
462325	463926	I used to make my grandma watch it.
465908	469010	I used to watch it all the time with, like, one of the early morning game shows.
469971	472493	Back when I was, like, ten years old, all I watched was game shows.
473693	477776	Now, when I was ten years old, the things that we watched were reruns of Press Your Luck.
479137	480939	No, Ami, no, Ami, no, Ami, no, Ami, no, Ami, stop!
480959	481299	Stop!
483516	490523	Dude, when I used to go shopping with my mom and I would put these random Nintendo magazines and candy in the cart, my mom would be all, how did that get there?
490543	492404	I'm like, I'm practicing to be on Supermarket Sweep.
494927	495448	Innocent look.
496188	498070	White-eared 50 hams in our cart.
499612	499992	I don't know.
500112	500813	I like ham.
502515	503616	Christmas is coming.
503776	504657	Didn't you get the memo?
507990	512515	PlayStation Network is getting some updates, or actually got some updates.
512855	519242	Not only the Ratchet & Clank demo to which Jamie earlier mentioned, but also a title that a lot of folks have been looking forward to, Everyday Shooter.
520255	526217	So it's kind of cool that the PlayStation is now getting some kind of like, you know, indie-ish games you can't get other places.
526317	529018	And Everyday Shooter is one of those games I've heard a lot of good things about.
529178	530579	You can get arrested for that kind of stuff.
530799	530999	What?
531479	532720	If you're an everyday shooter.
532780	537461	I'm not talking about like going out and shooting people from a clock tower or whatever.
537501	541663	I'm talking about... Chris, your jaw just dropped and like hit the hardwood floor.
543379	550744	While I was in Madison, I don't know the details, and you guys may have covered it, but some guy was going through one of the University of Wisconsin buildings.
551205	564574	I don't know if he had a weapon with him, or I forgot what exactly the details were, but he ended up jumping out of a window, and the reason he was running around the building like he was shooting things, because he thought he was playing the video game Doom.
567336	567777	Wow.
569355	572117	And people wonder why video games are being persecuted.
572137	572978	See, that's the problem.
573218	575100	He was playing Doom still.
575360	576861	He needs to really update his game.
576881	578803	If we could ban him from Doom, we would.
580865	581385	You know what?
582846	583667	Darwin Awards.
585128	588031	That's a perfect candidate for the Darwin Awards.
590478	596099	Well, Everyday Shooter will set you back $9.99, or to the rest of us, that's $10.
596980	602141	Also, on the PlayStation Network, you can get some Everyday Shooter wallpaper, and the cost of that, free.
602621	614864	Some movie trailers as well, Spiderwick Chronicles, Walk Hard, The Assassination of Jesse James, and some trailers for some video games, Fallout 3, Folklore, and I believe some things that were already mentioned previously in the show.
616404	618085	So that means you gotta tune in, yo.
619065	619905	Listen to what we say.
620945	628571	So, for those who were all, you know, happy about SingStar coming out, prepare to be unhappy.
629712	630933	Completely not happy.
631654	641082	It has been delayed past November 3rd, and it is hanging out, I guess, with Duke Nukem forever in Limbo Land.
642123	648568	Going, uh, I exist in theory, but will I release?
649348	649769	Oh, no!
651852	652192	Oh no.
653673	656594	They're not giving a reason for the delay.
657195	661797	Although the theories are that it's licensing problems and PlayStation Network issues.
664558	667459	But the Euro version will be out on time.
668120	681026	This kind of makes me sad because I was looking forward to that whole YouTube-y channel that they were going to be doing with SingStar and I was going to tape Loki and Secret singing Britney Spears or something and then put that up for the internet to see and they would have loved it.
681650	686653	So, damn it, when we made the tingle bet, we should have made the tingle bet around SingStar.
687013	694156	Instead of Loki setting an eye of judgment on fire in a match with Bobby, what we should have done is we should have made him do something on SingStar and then upload it to the network.
694196	696217	You know it would have been the number one video of all time.
696458	698699	Hey, you know, we still have I'm Staying In.
699639	702220	I know, but that's like last year's joke.
702741	703821	Actually, it's three years ago's joke.
703861	704562	You know what, though?
704662	709544	At E3, I really liked SingStar because I had some random guy come up and we were singing...
711630	713671	Motorhead at E3.
715952	717353	I don't remember.
717373	720535	Well, they have the expandable store, so you could get probably tons of stuff there.
720555	722316	I think everyone can get their emo on.
722676	725457	Yes, I'm sure there's one of those bands you can get your emo on.
725737	729019	I have a video of Megzi singing that from her cell phone, so I think you would enjoy that.
729079	731980	Megzi is very much now obsessed with My Chemical Romance.
733601	734582	Interesting.
735462	736823	She has the emo kid haircut now.
738867	741988	She might be the first lesbian I've ever met who's obsessed with My Chemical Romance.
742048	745149	I don't... Usually, like... Oh, second lesbian.
745189	745629	Sorry, Chris.
746069	751250	What about, like... I thought lesbians listened to, like, Melissa Etheridge and Katie Lang.
752430	755411	And, yeah, that I Kissed a Girl song and Sarah McLachlan.
755471	755751	Come on.
755791	757512	What happened to Lilith Fair?
758752	764253	Yeah, well, most people think that a lot of gay guys don't play video games, Rob.
766034	767414	And the webcam can catch that look.
770635	771655	Well, what can we say?
771755	773436	We're special here at Orange Lounge Radio.
773476	774056	Very special.
774496	782279	We are special because we're getting back into the interview habit and getting some people on our program coming on here and talking about the latest.
782499	785981	As you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio have a strange fascination with the lolcats.
786421	791663	So if you were listening a few weeks ago, you know that the advertisements for Geometry Wars Galaxies gave us a good laugh.
792276	796920	We knew we had to get them on the show to talk to them a little bit more about the ads and more importantly the game.
796960	797461	And guess what?
797501	798001	We got them.
798281	805307	Craig Howard is a game manager for Bizarre Creations and worked on not only Geometry Wars Galaxies but Boom Boom Rocket.
805788	810252	We were also joined during the interview by Ben Ward, Bizarre Creations community manager.
810652	817218	Sadly they couldn't be here live due to the time delay because they're over in the UK but let's listen in on what they had to say earlier this week.
824184	825144	How are you doing out there, Craig?
826665	827665	Yeah, I'm doing well, thanks.
828125	829605	Just a little bit cold at the moment.
829645	832646	We'll see you here as well as Ben Ward as well from Bazaar.
833226	833666	Oh, great.
833706	835547	Well, welcome, both of you guys, to the program.
836267	844069	And, of course, there's a little bit of a delay here since we are talking from such across a great distance because you guys are based out over there in the UK, right?
845650	847330	Yeah, it rained in Liverpool.
847810	849471	We'll do that at the moment.
849591	850331	It's just great.
852060	854162	I don't know, who came up with that idea?
854323	854863	Was it Roger Sierra?
873672	882174	It was just some crazy sort of idea that Sierra guys came up with, and it sort of went with the crazy commercial that we were running just before that.
882194	885675	Did you see the TV advert with all the guys dressed up as drum tour shapes?
885955	889056	I did, and that's available on the internet, on the website, too.
889456	894417	And that's one of my favorite songs you guys are using in the background for that advertisement.
894457	897798	It's a cover of a They Might Be Giants song, and so that's hilarious.
899011	899651	Yeah, you got it.
899691	910975	So that was just something that the guys at Sierra came up with and they literally just wanted to make it a little bit quirky and a little bit sort of unusual and pull the sort of audience in that you wouldn't normally get in a Drunk Toys game.
911616	918658	Yeah, I mean, we did, one of the good things is it's not just like a sci-fi style advertising campaign of the guys at Drunk Toys.
918978	919999	It's very interesting.
920359	923120	It tries to get more people interested in looking at the game.
925178	933766	Yeah, and it strangely seems to fit, you know, when you're hearing about Triangle Man and there actually are little, you know, triangle things that you're fighting in the game and everything, right?
934867	935487	Yeah, totally.
935527	940191	Well, we couldn't really make it too serious because that's not really what John Troll is about.
940251	945276	It's about having fun with your friends and sort of really getting stuck into a fun arcade game.
945356	951461	It's not about realistically fighting geometric shapes in outer space or something, you know, so it's all about having fun.
952533	953294	Absolutely, I agree.
953314	954414	It is all about having fun.
954915	965321	Tell me about, you know, Geometry Wars started as a part of Project Gotham Racing, turns into this spin-off game that's hugely successful on Xbox Live Arcade.
965801	974086	Where did the decision come to take the game, the series, from the Xbox Live or the Xbox platform over to the Nintendo platform as a standalone series?
975286	980089	Well, I mean, one of the things with Geometry Wars is it's always kind of used to test code as well.
980289	980629	And when...
981991	983472	We got the dev kits for Wii.
983892	985592	We started to have an experiment.
986533	989674	Obviously, people started playing it and then our ideas were going.
990314	991975	Initially, there was no channel.
991995	996436	There was no WiiWare or anything like that for the DS or Wii.
997397	1003519	So we thought if we were going to take it across into these platforms, what would we do?
1003619	1007601	How would we get it to make it feel worthwhile on those platforms?
1008101	1009381	It just seemed like a fun challenge.
1009961	1011342	The controls are interesting
1012026	1026014	Some people don't believe that it'll work well, but until you actually play the games and nunchuck, it just feels so much... It's different, but it still feels really good and fun and involved when you play the game.
1026595	1031498	Yeah, it wasn't really sort of a eureka, hey, let's do Geometry Wars on the Wii or anything like that.
1031558	1037081	It just sort of built up when we saw the new platforms and we saw what they were capable of, and somebody sort of said...
1037498	1039758	It'd be kind of cool if we put Geometry Wars on here.
1039778	1047700	So we did, and then it built up and built up, and then we got the guys at Sierra involved, and they brought Kuju in, and it's just sort of built up into a full game over time.
1048780	1050760	Did you guys put motion control in the game?
1050820	1053581	I haven't really been able to get a sense of that from what I've read initially.
1053641	1054281	Is there motion?
1054581	1056901	Did you guys incorporate the Wii motion controls in the game?
1058062	1064003	Yeah, I mean, what you do is you use the... You point with the wand, and you use the nunchuck to... to...
1066741	1068682	Sorry, I'm full of a cold at the moment.
1068822	1072403	It's all very difficult to speak.
1073564	1075345	We've got the controls working like that.
1075425	1080046	It works a little bit like a keyboard and mouse in the way that the controls work.
1080627	1081587	It does feel really nice.
1081667	1083688	And obviously on the DS we support the stylus.
1085736	1098154	Very cool, alright, so you're kind of like aiming either with the Wiimote or the stylus in the case of the DS version and then moving with the nunchuck or the directional pad That's right, yeah
1098530	1102171	I think, well, I mean, the DS obviously hasn't gone anything like that, and the amount of fans...
1127358	1129599	come back and say they'd love to be able to play the game on the move.
1129839	1133220	It was really high, so it made sense to work on the DS.
1134300	1137401	The Wii game, I mean, WiiWare still is quite a way off.
1138821	1140502	Well, it's getting closer now.
1140962	1146243	But at the time, yeah, it was a way for... It was just a way to take the game across to new people.
1146343	1150465	I mean, we're not going for full retail price.
1150485	1152885	It's going for competitive price as well.
1153445	1155386	So, you know, and you get a lot of gameplay there.
1156523	1158305	Well, I mean, it's a whole new campaign, though, since you've
1184815	1187256	sort of like 60 versions of Geometry Wars.
1188557	1195779	New enemies, you've got different sort of grid shapes, which make a huge difference in the way you play certain levels and the strategies.
1196940	1199761	You've also got a drone, which is one of the big new additions.
1200501	1212266	You've got an autonomous drone who, over the game, you build experience on this drone, you can nurture it to get new skills that can give you more battle strategies when you play the game.
1213320	1215262	There's a lot more there.
1215342	1218985	It's also got the original retro involved in there as well for fans of the game.
1220367	1226933	And also the big one is we've got multiplayer as well, which is also a nice new addition to the series.
1227694	1232495	We did sort of see those questions coming when we first sort of came up with this whole concept.
1232535	1238897	We did think that, hey, how are we going to justify charging however amount of money to buy this game?
1238937	1243098	And, you know, we've really thrown in a hell of a lot of gameplay to make it worthwhile for people.
1243338	1250560	We don't want anyone to feel ripped off once they've bought the game, but I don't think they will because, as Craig says, there's absolutely loads of content in there.
1252059	1253399	Yeah, I mean, if you have the
1282185	1286186	There's quite a few ways of interconnecting the two platforms work.
1287006	1295648	If you have both versions of the game, you can unlock an extra solar system within the game with new unique maps and battles.
1296388	1298969	So that's a reward people have brought on both platforms.
1300089	1308651	Also, if you've just got the Wii version or just the DS version, you can upload the whole retro evolved to your DS or your friend's DS.
1309942	1312243	So, you know, again, a lot more people play in the game.
1312283	1314023	That's the theory behind all of this.
1314863	1322265	So, by doing that, you know, with one cartridge in the office, a lot of people can be playing multiplayer games.
1322925	1323565	Things like that.
1323985	1326025	We try to be as generous as we can with the game.
1327226	1329386	And I noticed the Wi-Fi seal on the game too.
1329406	1332147	Does that mean you've got the online leaderboards and that too?
1333387	1334067	That's right, yeah.
1334087	1335647	We support full online leaderboards.
1336108	1338048	One of the caveats to the game was we wouldn't
1338479	1340559	wouldn't do it if we couldn't support online leaderboards.
1340979	1345820	Because no matter how good you are, you want to see how good you are against your friends and against everyone else in the world.
1347260	1347501	Awesome.
1347541	1349821	Well, where do you guys see Geometry Wars going in the future?
1349861	1361363	Do you think there's a possibility of something based on Geometry Wars waves if the Nintendo Wii version, DS versions are successful at continuing and growing the franchise on the Nintendo platforms?
1362503	1367404	Yeah, I mean, Geometry Wars is something that is its own beast and it's moving on in its own...
1368844	1375349	but there's definitely things that we're considering in the future and looking at at the moment.
1376030	1385677	It's great to be very careful with what he says because I'm sort of holding a hammer over his head at the moment saying, we haven't announced this yet!
1385697	1387578	We're always looking at expanding.
1387778	1395224	It's a big fan base to the game and we listen to our fans and we're trying to set aside them and get more people playing the game.
1396164	1397245	Well, best of luck to you guys.
1397265	1409971	I hope the cats sell tons and tons of copies of Geometry Wars, because it certainly is, you know, Geometry Wars Retro was one of, definitely my favorite Xbox Live download titles, and you gotta love the cats advertising the game.
1410291	1411952	You definitely know you can trust them.
1412332	1419115	But I gotta ask you, since I understand, Craig, you're the game manager not only over Geometry Wars, but you also worked on Boom Boom Rocket, right?
1419892	1420232	That's right, yeah.
1420252	1422194	Yeah, there's more to come from the world of Boom Boom Rocket.
1422214	1424556	I don't know exactly what I can say, what I can't, but...
1446956	1450720	We've made additional content and hopefully it's going to be releasing.
1450740	1457346	There's still all sorts of caveats that we need to sort out with the publisher and Xbox Live Marketplace and all that sort of stuff.
1457366	1462491	So hopefully there will be something but I don't want to commit to anything because I don't know the details to be honest.
1463419	1465519	Understandable, I understand there's got to be secrets.
1465879	1473821	Well, thank you guys so much for being on the show today, but before I let you guys go, we always ask all our guests that come on the program, we want to know, how is your gaming week?
1473861	1476781	What kind of video games have you been playing besides the ones at the office?
1479262	1481002	I've been playing Halo 3, obviously.
1481022	1488143	Halo 3, and I've been playing Boarded Out on the Dreamcast, because it's a great show.
1488283	1491564	I've been playing Halo 3 as well.
1492137	1494638	and I've just finished World in Conflict on PC.
1494798	1495958	That's an awesome game.
1496038	1497039	Really, really love that.
1497079	1506842	But I think Halo 3 and then when Gotham hits the shelves in the UK, I'll be playing that some more as well and beating all of our community on that or losing horribly to all our community on that.
1507762	1508583	Sounds pretty awesome.
1508623	1511704	I mean, I think the entire internet is playing Halo 3 right now.
1511744	1514585	But I have to ask the question, definitive question on Halo 3.
1515145	1516826	Do you prefer co-op or competitive?
1518246	1518826	Co-op.
1519266	1519967	Competitive.
1521704	1525405	Just hope you keep checking our website and see the stuff we're announcing and
1548564	1549365	www.bizarrecreations.com
1574594	1575035	Thanks a lot.
1575596	1575776	Cheers.
1597330	1597570	All right.
1597590	1601293	Well, thank you very much to those folks from Bizarre Creations for joining us.
1601473	1603134	That was Craig Howard and Ben Ward.
1603154	1611739	And I have to actually kind of give a little bit of personal apologies because, you know, the whole time zone thing, I said I would interview them at 2 o'clock their time.
1612180	1617563	And I thought for some reason when I looked it up on the Internet, it said 7 a.m., but it actually ended up being 6 a.m.
1617603	1619685	So I roll out of bed at like 6.30 and I check my email.
1619705	1620925	They're like, we're waiting for you to call.
1620965	1621606	I'm like, oh, no.
1622239	1622759	Thanks for watching!
1638729	1639769	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1667210	1667610	Awesome!
1667690	1668610	Awesome, I get a mic.
1695976	1702603	Anyways, so yeah, some fun information other than bizarre stuff.
1703344	1704025	Let's see here.
1705006	1710892	Our friends over at All Games, of course, they have some ties with G4 and stuff.
1711473	1714716	And this all goes back to, of course, Video Games Live.
1715457	1717419	And so Video Games Live, wonderful show.
1717479	1717780	It's been...
1718712	1719232	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1741656	1742376	That's pretty cool.
1742837	1747479	And, of course, it's a little bit different than, say, your usual concerts.
1747619	1749840	All video game music, all done by an orchestra.
1750680	1751201	Very cool.
1751261	1755383	If you're in the area of one of those concerts, definitely worth checking out.
1757264	1757744	All righty.
1758268	1760410	Well, you know the game Rock Band?
1760430	1772878	If you want to have a concert of your own, you've got to get this game Rock Band because it's going to have the keyboards and the vocals and tambourines because you can use the microphone as a tambourine.
1773118	1777421	Well, unfortunately, the only way you're going to be able to get this game is in a bundle form.
1777802	1779523	It's going to be bundle only in the year 2007.
1780363	1782345	You cannot get these separate peripherals separately.
1782665	1782745	E.A.
1782805	1784747	has been telling us that's what's been going on.
1810331	1812033	And now it was confirmed for the public this week.
1812453	1817097	Now what I'm thinking, maybe there was like a third party, like are third party controllers going to be out and available?
1817117	1817457	Possibly.
1817477	1818117	Of course, right?
1818398	1818638	Maybe.
1818978	1819999	Yeah, so maybe that's what it is.
1820039	1824362	But as far as the official first party peripherals, unfortunately those are not going to be out until 2008.
1825203	1826624	Sorry, guys.
1827465	1831488	So it's going to cost you $170 to play a rock band unless you want to use your existing guitars or microphones.
1832809	1838293	Well, this one's sort of interesting to me, although it's interesting in a quite different way than probably how they're listing it.
1839497	1857487	There's a group of graduate students that have mapped video game controllers onto different types of wearable fabrics where you can give massages while playing video games.
1859848	1864891	On their website, they give instructions on how to make one for yourself.
1865798	1869519	But, and I want to watch the video on this, however it's not loaded up.
1869719	1877820	And given that, you know, I am a massage therapist, I have definite reservations for how safe this is.
1877860	1882901	Because I know, from personal experience, if you do it wrong, you can fuck somebody up.
1883682	1890523	I mean, that's why we have to go to school for however many hours and learn how to do it right.
1891337	1895858	Let me ask your professional opinion, quote-unquote, since you have, you know, gone to the school, gone to the training and all that stuff.
1896098	1904961	There's a lot of people, though, that give the casual massages, you know, like in the privacy of their own home, like, ooh, baby, I could really use a massage right now, you know, and no training and that stuff, right?
1905281	1912263	So as long as they're not applying a lot of pressure, though, as long as it's like a I don't know what I'm doing type massage, do you think it's okay?
1912724	1914844	Actually, you can.
1916405	1918485	This is just going from what they said in school.
1918986	1920506	Touch is very important for people.
1921309	1943460	and even if it's really light there's still a lot of um emotion that you can bring out in another person um a lot of uh if they've got say that they have a circulatory issue you can actually cause problems with that lymphatic problems you can move um the lymph in their skin um
1946804	1947745	You have to be kind of careful.
1947905	1951027	Well, they actually have a full-on hospital-grade lymphatic massage.
1951687	1958392	For example, a lot of women who've had mastectomies, they remove a lot of the lymph nodes.
1958852	1964876	And so you'll see these deposits in their arms, under their armpits, from excess lymph drainage.
1965997	1971441	And so you run into... Anyone who's not a professional...
1972353	1980358	Tries to give, and it seems to me that for, to use a controller like this, they'd have to be using a bit of pressure, don't you think?
1980378	1981178	Yeah.
1981558	1991044	So, they run into a lot of risk with, especially it seems to me they're doing around the center back, you're dealing with problems dealing with the spine.
1991064	1991584	Mm-hmm.
1992379	1994140	You can get into some nerve damage.
1994520	2004184	Everything, the way it connects, I would not agree with letting an unprofessional... I'm looking at the official website for this, massage-me.at is the official site for this.
2004244	2007465	I don't see anything on the front page about doctor tests or anything.
2007686	2015869	Now granted, I have not, to this website's credit, because I don't want to misrepresent anything, I have not looked through and through all these different pages that are here, so I don't know if they have any type of...
2016169	2017610	Hey, the doctor says it's okay.
2017910	2019850	But this looks like, you know, university students.
2020491	2024632	To me, I'm looking at this university students idea of, you know, something innovative.
2025052	2026433	So, yes, it's innovative.
2026833	2030054	But could it be dangerous, possibly?
2030474	2030854	I don't know.
2030874	2032054	I'm checking out their thanks.
2032455	2033475	I'm trying to look at their blog.
2033555	2034995	Yeah, their thanks didn't say any doctor.
2035015	2040417	There's nothing on here about being an actual professional massage therapist.
2040958	2041798	I'm looking at...
2044165	2045185	They're very true.
2045786	2047227	Massage is very good for you.
2047387	2062537	I know this from experience, but at the same point, if they're not professional, they don't have anything on their listing, any kind of credentials, I would not condone having this type of thing.
2063359	2067561	Yeah, I mean, you know, and to these guys' credit, you know, I don't want to, again, misrepresent it or whatever.
2067681	2076364	It seems like a really interesting idea, and, you know, certainly they're thinking outside the box, but just for their own sake, I hope they've consulted a doctor on it, because I don't see anything on the website.
2076384	2079205	They don't really have to consult a doctor, just consult another massage therapist.
2079625	2080145	I'm confused.
2080165	2081806	Do you do the massage on somebody?
2082346	2082506	Yes.
2082526	2083066	Or on the person?
2083106	2086508	They're wearing this jacket that has the contacts in it.
2086948	2087028	Oh.
2088283	2089704	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2108476	2109096	Go through the jacket.
2140743	2141483	I would not.
2143324	2149068	Okay, there's actually a list on here that's telling you how to do it, but they're not doing it right.
2149428	2150408	You're doing it wrong.
2151809	2153310	You're doing it wrong.
2154470	2154911	All right.
2154971	2158072	Well, if you want more information on that, it's called Massage Me.
2158333	2162895	So we don't want to take too much time talking about it because we're not a massage podcast.
2163075	2164476	I do not condone this.
2164536	2168438	And on top of that, I'm actually going to be referring this site to the director of my school.
2169534	2171235	Because this is actually potentially very dangerous.
2173436	2173757	Narc.
2174577	2176979	Anyways.
2177799	2182682	So... Konami's made a little boo-boo.
2183043	2189206	Or somebody has made a little boo-boo as far as advertising the brand new Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles.
2189307	2192468	Unfortunately, the Belmonts have now become the Beaumonts.
2193229	2195751	So... I don't know.
2195791	2197932	It's a different family that's destroying Dracula.
2198579	2204063	It's just, you know, quite a coincidence that their names are so close together.
2204864	2213390	And of course, there's been, you know, mistakes in ads before, including an ad for Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, which was advertised as being on the Sony Wii.
2215592	2217894	So... I don't know.
2218154	2218814	Mistakes happen.
2220115	2220996	Much like the show.
2223097	2225960	The proofreaders out there are getting fired as we speak.
2226040	2226620	What can we say?
2227060	2227381	Alright, um...
2228425	2233148	The Gods and Heroes MMO is on indefinite hiatus.
2247674	2248295	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2266681	2267141	Thank you for watching!
2305362	2310325	FU goes to the security at my work for saying, oh, there's nothing we can do.
2311066	2312086	Which was bullshit.
2312987	2316309	Pure and utter stinky bullshit.
2317410	2321392	So I am going to go back and take a photo of the license tag of that car.
2322453	2323553	Say they can't find them?
2323673	2324574	Oh, fuck you.
2325635	2326635	I can find them easily.
2326795	2329517	I saw them just the other day, and I have a very good camera.
2331798	2333359	I am not going to stop.
2333379	2333479	Stop.
2335683	2336724	Until justice is served.
2338085	2339146	Judge Jamie's on the case.
2339586	2348333	And if they decide to do nothing else, I'm going to address it with our CEO about how ineffectual our security is.
2348873	2350054	I'm sorry to hear that follow-up.
2350074	2353797	That was a kind of screwed-up story you told last week on the show, so that's kind of unfortunate.
2354218	2354538	Oh, yes.
2355519	2355839	F that.
2356439	2356820	Oh, yes.
2357380	2357680	All right.
2358121	2361764	Because remember, when I have my mindset to something, I get results.
2362624	2363125	Anything else?
2364245	2364706	Anything else?
2365236	2366817	Fuck a whole bunch of that shit!
2367097	2367438	Loki.
2370120	2374363	Um... I guess, fuck you, the fact that there's not a lot of good games out right now.
2374483	2381028	I mean, it's a bit of a lull until, like, next few weeks when there's a ton of shit coming out, so... I need more stuff to play.
2382029	2383350	I need more time to play it in, too.
2386167	2388650	I'll go next, and then we'll go to Puppy and Chris.
2389271	2393136	My FU of the week obviously goes to the sad state of disrepair this show is in tonight.
2393456	2401626	I have no idea what's going on, but between the audio problems and now we have our internet problems that we don't have the live listeners right now, we're pretty much doing Part B for tape this week.
2401966	2404229	It's like poltergeist is in the house tonight.
2404329	2405651	I don't know what the hell is going on.
2406590	2408151	I apologize to the listeners.
2408371	2409091	I don't know what's up.
2409351	2410132	Shit happens, though.
2410172	2410552	What can you expect?
2410752	2411953	You get what you pay for, right?
2412033	2412853	It's a free program.
2412873	2413413	What can you say?
2413553	2414154	Damn straight.
2414174	2414934	We try our best.
2415354	2416175	We gotta keep it moving.
2416355	2417375	We do better than Yaris.
2417695	2418496	Yeah, that's true.
2418516	2419656	We do a better job at it than Yaris.
2419696	2420717	Alright, Puppy, your FU's.
2421657	2422678	Um, let's see.
2422978	2426720	Comcast gets one for internet going down at my apartment earlier today.
2428500	2432542	And... Wow, I... Otherwise, I had a good week.
2432883	2433643	That's a surprise.
2435681	2438582	FU to you for having such a good week, bastard.
2439182	2440403	Sucks to be you, then.
2441003	2441983	Chris, your FU of the week.
2442423	2445784	My FU of the week goes to my dad's girlfriend.
2447084	2452206	She needs to know that she's 33 now, and not 13.
2452366	2457267	It needs to kind of take some responsibility for her fucking actions.
2458027	2461188	And also, this is the biggest one, needs to realize...
2462176	2468320	that if you cannot accept the consequences of having a child, then don't get knocked up in the first place.
2469761	2475264	She literally told me, and I quote, because I told everyone that I'm moving to Wisconsin in March.
2476024	2478366	Oh, you cannot... She's Japanese, by the way.
2478386	2479406	I'm not trying to make fun of her.
2479426	2480767	This is exactly how she sounds.
2481327	2485610	Oh, you cannot move to... You have to move here and take care of our babies.
2487391	2490813	Elise, it's the parents' job to take care of the babies.
2491966	2496734	Oh, being a parent is a full-time job.
2497656	2498116	Yeah!
2498197	2499419	No shit, Sherlock!
2502305	2502845	God!
2502865	2509829	I seriously thought, think, she thinks that I was going to stay there and take care of their little bundle of joy.
2509849	2512850	I mean, I'm going to be a big sister and all, but I ain't taking care of it.
2512910	2514070	It ain't my responsibility.
2514651	2516852	She's just like, she seriously acts like she's 13.
2516972	2518993	I don't know what my dad sees in her.
2519313	2520794	I think he's having a midlife crisis.
2520814	2521154	He's like 53.
2523579	2526641	This is the level of stupid She got in a car crash the other week
2552108	2556810	and they, everyone who was involved in the car accident got her information, got everything they needed to get.
2557230	2559391	She didn't get their names even.
2559611	2560611	She didn't get anything.
2560631	2564773	There was nothing that she took away from this car crash except excuses.
2564873	2567734	And of course it's her fault because she's the one who crashed into them.
2570996	2571456	Damn woman.
2573497	2573797	Alright.
2573897	2574237	I'm done.
2575617	2575978	Alright.
2576178	2577358	That's going to do it for the FUs of the week.
2577398	2579459	Unfortunately, the Poltergeist is still affecting our network.
2579479	2580379	We're still not live.
2581020	2581280	Bummer.
2582368	2583369	I know, it's like Halloween.
2583429	2585090	This place is haunted.
2585570	2585771	What?
2586491	2587071	Oh, thank you.
2587712	2589033	Chris got the little picture of the kitty.
2589193	2590013	Wait, I'll fix it.
2591134	2591434	Thanks.
2592315	2592595	Thanks.
2592996	2593556	Just what I need.
2595836	2597297	Well, maybe the mailbag will fix it.
2597317	2600019	Because if this keeps up, unfortunately, we're not going to be able to get to Skype tonight.
2600039	2602200	And I know some folks wanted to call in and do some game reviews.
2602581	2604522	But at least there's the old mailbag.
2604602	2610246	And when you email us at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, it's practically the old-fashioned way of interacting with a podcast at this point.
2610266	2614129	But when the newfangled stuff breaks, we turn to the mailbag.
2614169	2615410	So mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
2615430	2618152	DarkSakura is going to open it up and pick some of her favorites right now.
2619012	2619733	I'm tangled up.
2620313	2621394	I can't do it by myself.
2622695	2624456	Hey, listen.
2626337	2627717	It is time for the mailbag.
2628697	2632038	So, um, first thing actually comes from Rob with two B's.
2633238	2638099	Um, he sent a link to a story, and this is very Darwin award-y.
2639119	2643600	Um, in Moscow, a ten-year-old committed suicide after parents banned computer games.
2644460	2650381	And just to, uh, his name was, um, Andrei Smirnoff, which, I'm not gonna say anything.
2650401	2650441	Um,
2654817	2680878	who was a class 3 student jumped to his death after his parents were blaming his bad conduct in school and poor performance in class on video games and he had made a comment about it in his diary and then jumped out of a window so I'm like yeah that just means that your kid was fucked in the head also and to continue with his email
2681525	2687147	Also, I loved your argument about microtransactions and other poorly named events.
2687727	2694810	If you really want to draw a line objectively, a transaction, in quotes, is a payment in monetary units.
2695370	2702093	A microtransaction would be a one-one-thousandth of a transaction, or less than one penny.
2703133	2709976	If you remember, the office space embezzlement scenario was based upon taking the money less than one cent off every transaction and adding them up.
2711895	2721807	So in that case, and if you are using pure terminology, a microtransaction would have to consist of less than one one-thousandth of a penny.
2722487	2725531	So therefore, the term microtransaction is actually an incorrect term.
2726132	2726872	I was right.
2727053	2728735	I'm not going to have this stupid argument again.
2731489	2738752	Well, that's my whole thing that I hate about modern language use is this whole let's just completely define everything but use really bad definitions.
2739032	2739212	LOL.
2739912	2740912	ROTFL.
2741253	2742853	No, that's not what I'm talking about.
2744153	2744974	Preboarding.
2746974	2752376	You know, putting unnecessary prefixes to words.
2755117	2756658	George Carlin did point that out, didn't he?
2756678	2757098	Yeah.
2757620	2761463	But then again, there's also literal and, you know, applied means of things.
2761523	2765646	For example, micromachines were not one thousandth the size of a car.
2766307	2767348	Actually, I think that they were.
2767368	2769049	They were smaller.
2769529	2769890	Okay.
2769990	2771751	I think that they were one thousandth.
2771911	2772512	Whatever.
2772632	2773052	Shit.
2773592	2774553	They were smaller.
2774653	2775034	Okay.
2775114	2776074	That's all that matters.
2776134	2777956	No one's going to do the fucking scale shit.
2777976	2779157	This is not model building.
2779217	2779477	Okay.
2779877	2781198	No fucking train sets here.
2782379	2784421	Would you say this compares to how it works?
2784521	2787123	There's an item on the menu called the cheese quesadilla.
2787890	2790331	When a quesadilla literally means, you know, cheese.
2790671	2794893	So it's like you're ordering a peanut peanut butter sandwich or something.
2796254	2797754	You're ordering a cheese cheese sandwich.
2797774	2799055	Or it's like ordering chai tea.
2799695	2800675	Because chai means tea.
2802516	2807258	So, you know, I think that it's more or less... You know, everybody in the world is stupid.
2807318	2809459	Let's accommodate the language to everybody's stupidity.
2810760	2811640	I don't like to...
2812466	2813606	I do not like to live in a world where...
2838473	2845199	She did show me the one I have in my cubicle with a picture of Captain Kirk saying, James T. Kirk, I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome I am.
2845699	2845959	Emails?
2846199	2847521	Okay.
2847641	2849722	This one comes from One Night Stands.
2851424	2858730	Hello, I just recently started to listen to your podcast and I must say that I really like them as they don't bore me, except for the Onion Audio and Video podcast.
2859851	2865576	A few times on the show, Sky, I think I'm still trying to figure out the difference between the two guys, has mentioned that he's gay.
2866743	2881094	The first time I thought he was just joking and then I was listening to your most recent one where Skye and Jamie went to the movies and started talking about the sanctity of marriage and then running off to Vegas to get married to immediately divorce.
2881994	2883295	It's just something about being gay.
2884216	2887999	And I know it's tacky to dig into other people's lives and find out what their sexual orientation is.
2888459	2893563	I long for the days when people like Perez Hilton were branded with a scarlet letter, probably G for gossip.
2894043	2895224	And I've been wondering, are you gay?
2898663	2901266	I'm very happy to be on this program.
2902507	2905330	I think that it's great to hear that one of the three main people is.
2905450	2907211	As a gay gamer, I think it's great to hear.
2907732	2912196	It's great to see celebrities being out and proud and know the fan base is not swayed by their sexual preference.
2912256	2913897	Sky, DarkSakura, Loki, keep up the good work.
2914098	2915779	Is that person insinuating I'm a celebrity?
2916420	2917020	Rad!
2918061	2919202	Ooh, ego plus plus.
2919443	2921865	And I look forward to hearing your next podcast.
2922745	2923146	P.S.
2923206	2924908	My handle is a Simpsons reference.
2925409	2926650	Everyone thinks it's a sex thing.
2927992	2928253	Wow.
2928633	2929594	It's one night stands.
2929855	2930516	One night stands.
2932105	2935106	Now that, usually that's what you'd find on gay.com, one night stands.
2935666	2942068	Yeah, no, I'm Sky, the voice you hear right now is, or Rob, I don't really, not a lot of people call me Sky anymore, but Rob, and yeah, I'm gay.
2942328	2943829	So, but that's not what the show's all about.
2943849	2945589	The show's about video games, but I understand.
2945729	2947130	I totally understand where you're coming from.
2947490	2961234	Because sometimes, I can kind of speak from experience, it's kind of hard to find, gay gamers are in an interesting niche, I think, because in gaming culture, you know, obviously thanks to the Xbox Lives of the world, where, you know, fag, fag, fag,
2961494	2961794	DarkSakura.com
2976505	2977627	Click, click, mute, warn.
2977867	2978468	Love Halo 3.
2978668	2980210	It's because Rob is an attention whore.
2981151	2982833	Well, and then in the other side of it.
2982853	2987279	So you have the gaming culture frowns on gays to some extent.
2987399	2988280	Obviously not everybody.
2988601	2990083	It's a few bad apples ruining the barrel.
2990323	2991765	But then you have in gay culture...
2992165	2997467	You know, like, oh, you mean you don't shop at, you know, Nordstrom's and you don't listen to Madonna?
2997587	2998787	And why don't you go to the club with us?
2998827	3000528	Why do you have to stay home and play games?
3000868	3002289	Come on, let's go out, you know.
3003509	3008691	Let's go get Madonna tickets for $250 and, you know, let's do crack.
3008791	3011032	I don't know, you know.
3011072	3011592	I'm not, again.
3012947	3021590	I'm not saying all gays are like that, but unfortunately, you know, I felt that kind of judgment from some of those very superficial people that, you know, oh, you play games?
3021650	3024872	That's like a, you know, that's a little kid thing, or that's not a gay thing.
3024892	3026672	Well, you know, who's to say what is what?
3026712	3028233	You know, people like what they like.
3028613	3037837	So anyway, you know, and I don't like to usually advertise the fact I'm gay on the program because this is not the, oh my god, the really big gay podcast about video games!
3040015	3044016	Okay guys, I cannot wait to review Gears of War because that is hot.
3044996	3047136	No, you missed Rob singing show tunes last week.
3048417	3050057	We already busted out the show tunes last week.
3050077	3054558	But no, in all seriousness, again, it's just that, you know, it is what it is.
3055218	3060699	I'm gay, but I also, I've been playing video games a lot longer than I've been dating men.
3061019	3062899	Let's put it that way, I guess.
3063079	3063419	I don't know.
3064580	3065180	Chris is a lesbian.
3065500	3066800	Yes, I'm a very big dyke.
3068263	3069864	Dyke Power, Yo.
3070725	3071406	I like boobies.
3071786	3076269	But most of all, we like games, so that's what it really boils down to.
3076590	3077110	And boobies.
3077310	3082134	I like boobies too, so that's I guess something everybody... I think it's a unanimous vote in this room that boobies are great.
3082154	3082915	Boobies, yes.
3083295	3084676	All right, all in favor of boobies?
3085016	3085757	Aye.
3086177	3086858	All opposed?
3089200	3092082	I was too late on the four boobies.
3092943	3093203	All right.
3093423	3094264	We have unanimous...
3096071	3098972	I don't know what else to say to that email.
3099152	3103613	I'm going to have to tell William that somebody couldn't figure it out.
3103933	3104133	What?
3104333	3105753	I'm kidding.
3106113	3107193	Here's the thing, though.
3107673	3110094	Perez Hilton totally sold out.
3110114	3112714	He used to be cool a year ago, but totally sold out.
3112994	3114615	You've got to find some new blogs to read, dude.
3114955	3115195	Sorry.
3115495	3116415	Perez Hilton kind of sold out.
3117335	3119736	Drawing coke coming out of people's noses isn't funny anymore, sorry to say.
3120876	3121816	Perez Hilton?
3121836	3122416	Yeah, that website.
3122436	3123777	The Gossip Blogger.
3124477	3124617	Oh!
3124697	3125257	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3125277	3125557	All right.
3125936	3127097	Anyway, sorry.
3127277	3127938	Next email.
3128359	3128979	Next email.
3129039	3129940	Hey, okay.
3129960	3131462	God, this is such awful spelling.
3131522	3132663	I'm sorry, whoever you are.
3133744	3134205	Lycan.
3134505	3134866	I'm sorry.
3135106	3137188	One more thing on the gay thing because I forgot to mention this.
3137749	3143275	Praise and happy thoughts and thank yous to the folks who make websites for the...
3144315	3145055	DarkSakura.com
3167301	3172603	Praise to those people that make the niches on the internet for those kind of people to find each other.
3173103	3177564	And I'm just talking in general too, not just gay and gaming, but all types of minorities.
3178004	3180085	So, hooray.
3180185	3180805	Now we can move on.
3181025	3184386	Hey Orange Lounge, I'm kind of a new listener, but I already say you guys rock.
3184806	3185746	I do have a question.
3185806	3194169	You talk about Final Fantasy a lot, but I've never heard you talk about Final Fantasy X. Is there a reason, as I've been playing it a lot recently, this is from Lycan.
3194557	3198320	Wait, am I on crack or wasn't there an email last week where we talked about Final Fantasy X?
3198381	3200182	I swear to God it came up like last week or two weeks ago.
3200202	3208630	I think we did talk about Final Fantasy X. Maybe this person's behind in their podcast listening, so we'll give them a bye, but... That and Final Fantasy X's fucking old.
3209551	3212393	I mean, if we're on like Final Fantasy XII now.
3212814	3213294	No, seriously.
3214315	3215476	Played that game like years ago.
3215916	3217718	It was an awesome game, but it was years ago.
3217738	3218879	X was great, but we've moved on.
3218919	3219720	X2, not so great.
3220481	3220781	We're with...
3223055	3224916	This fandom is still on seven.
3225136	3226237	The fandom for ten.
3226277	3233241	I mean, you go to any, you know, anime convention, guaranteed you're going to see a Tubby Yuna.
3233461	3233901	Somewhere.
3234362	3234662	Always.
3236223	3236603	Always.
3236663	3238124	So the fandom is never going to die.
3239104	3241086	And then, you know, a Waka with a pooch.
3241206	3248070	You know, it's... You know what really bothers me is the pregnant fetish fan art.
3248690	3248970	What?
3250011	3250831	It's on DeviantArt.
3251031	3251932	All over DeviantArt.
3251992	3252212	Okay.
3252232	3252312	Okay.
3252961	3257903	When I talked about the whole, like, minority subculture thing, maybe there are a few exceptions.
3259783	3266405	Yeah, they have a big, big subculture of people who like, what is it, inflated art?
3266945	3268866	Where basically they make girls.
3269086	3269746	It's mostly girls.
3269766	3272187	With boobs that are three times the size of their bodies?
3272467	3272987	Exactly.
3273087	3277909	And they're, like, they're big, they're fat, like, way more physically than they should be.
3278329	3279549	Like, in any way, shape, or form.
3279709	3282030	It's not physically possible for these people to breathe.
3283403	3285724	I think I need to rethink my argument on the counterculture thing.
3285764	3287825	Maybe I need to rethink those kudos a little bit.
3288726	3300551	I'm so hypocritical because I sit there and I go, I don't have to look at that art, but then I see it on the favorites page and I just go, that shit should not be here.
3301505	3304788	Because it's so fucking... You know, most of it is really bad, too.
3304848	3305868	Like, these people can't draw.
3305928	3313534	But the only reason that it ends up on the favorite page is because some... There's a bunch of morons out there who are wanking to this.
3313674	3314675	And it's disgusting.
3315215	3318017	Are you sure they just aren't out of proportion just because they are bad artists?
3318638	3320139	You know, sometimes I wonder.
3320239	3322921	Like, they accidentally got it really big.
3322941	3324242	No, they draw fat very well.
3324462	3325123	Yeah, I can show you.
3325583	3326344	It's really disgusting.
3326564	3327505	Yeah, I can draw fat.
3327585	3329206	It's a circle with a stick.
3329673	3332535	for leg, stick for arm, stick for neck, circle for head.
3333395	3340399	Oh, like the chicken Willy Wonka when she ate the blueberry thing.
3340439	3344661	Next email, please.
3345142	3346983	From Final Fantasy X to snozzberries.
3347043	3349684	Look, you're going to ask us a question like that, that's what you're going to get.
3350465	3352025	What do you think of Final Fantasy X?
3352145	3352826	Snozzberries.
3354193	3355894	Hey OLR, it's Nintendo Maniac 64.
3356014	3361579	I noticed something this week with the update for Kirby's Final Smash on the Smash Bros.
3361619	3362079	Brawl site.
3362599	3370646	If you compare the bottom of the Japanese webpage to the English or any other language page, you notice that the Japanese version has some kind of extra sound clip recording.
3371226	3372687	Any idea what this might be?
3373067	3378532	Unfortunately, since Rob's computer is the primary, we cannot correctly answer this question.
3378572	3379052	So next!
3379562	3383145	But I will hypothesize, since they're saying it's an audio thing, right?
3383205	3384006	I will hypothesize.
3384346	3389351	Perhaps it is a piece of work that has not been translated or brought over yet.
3389471	3390792	Or simply it was just an oversight.
3390812	3393255	If it's curvy, why would it have any words to it?
3393295	3393855	I guess that's true.
3393875	3395617	I think it's just an oversight then.
3395957	3397899	I think you're being a little tinfoil hat-ish.
3398079	3398980	I wouldn't worry just yet.
3400121	3401823	I think it's just an oversight, so don't worry.
3401843	3403124	There you go.
3403144	3403844	There's an example.
3403904	3405206	Oh, my God!
3407634	3409936	What the hell is that?
3410116	3419925	That's actually a lot better than... There's a picture on DeviantArt, and it's on the favorites page, and it's actually a lot better than the most of the stuff.
3420025	3423288	At least this girl is somewhat in proportion, but Jesus Christ.
3424389	3425770	She looks like a walrus.
3426570	3429793	She looks like she's about ready to go goo-goo-ka-choo, okay, for one.
3430874	3435238	Okay, for B, did you ever see... And this is great radio, by the way, because I'm responding to a picture...
3436296	3440439	And I'm totally being a hypocrite right now with this whole thing that I said, you know, oh, the countercultures are great.
3440660	3441140	Not this.
3442501	3445383	Everything I said earlier, this is not a part of that.
3445403	3445923	Do not want.
3446064	3446764	Do not want.
3446864	3447324	Exactly.
3447625	3448225	Here's the thing.
3449186	3453469	Like, did you ever see that face as a death where the guy had elephantitis of the balls?
3453729	3454210	Here we go.
3454230	3455390	That's what her tits look like.
3457252	3457592	What?
3459593	3460154	What website?
3460314	3461215	Is it DeviantArt?
3461235	3461595	DeviantArt.
3462879	3464180	Do you want to have a fun time?
3464440	3471764	Go to deviantart.com and in the search, type inflation and just watch the funny shit happen.
3471824	3475407	I swear, it's just like, people that should not be.
3476107	3481270	It looks like a bunch of freaking world record tumors like I saw on Ripley's Believe It or Not.
3481310	3482031	Or you know what?
3483291	3483932	Or you know what?
3484072	3485733	Don't and go play video games instead.
3485753	3486974	You'll thank us later.
3488495	3488755	Sorry.
3489155	3489695	Oh no.
3489735	3490276	That can't be real.
3490316	3490776	You have to show me.
3492452	3494173	It's like somebody's Halloween costume.
3494193	3494933	See, now that's funny.
3495173	3500936	Somebody looks like she has beach balls for titties.
3503497	3504597	Next email, please.
3504617	3505457	Do not want.
3506298	3507358	Hey guys, I love the show.
3507378	3510039	Just wanted to know if you've seen the masterpiece that is Dead Fantasy 1.
3511560	3513041	If not, check it out now.
3513101	3514341	Congrats on another milestone.
3514921	3517683	250 is certainly an accomplishment for an independent podcast.
3518023	3519423	Pat yourselves on the ass.
3519864	3520924	Thanks for reading this.
3522240	3523040	That's from Resimo.
3545128	3546749	It has some really kick-ass stuff, though.
3546789	3552013	Like, they have a picture of, like, Cloud as a chick on a bike, and it looks really good.
3552533	3556276	But definitely check out, like, you know, the Haloid and Dead Fantasy stuff.
3556296	3559398	I'll have to show it in the studio after the show.
3559479	3566764	But it's seriously some kick-ass wire foo shit that a lot of it borrowed heavily from The Matrix.
3566864	3567985	But really awesome.
3568005	3568265	Check it out.
3571124	3572104	That's it for the emails.
3572164	3574446	How about something that has nothing to do with inflation?
3574506	3576106	Chris, put the inflation away.
3578287	3583470	Although seriously, part of me wants to make the album art for Orange Lounge Radio this week, one of those pictures.
3583770	3586171	If there weren't copyright issues, I'd totally do it.
3586251	3588852	But anyway, let's move on.
3588912	3589492	Shout, Chris.
3589512	3590373	I'm not looking at inflation.
3590393	3590833	It's his fault.
3592013	3592294	All right.
3593154	3593594	Moving on.
3593954	3594735	Loki, it's your turn.
3596175	3600017	Anyways, let's get this train back in the tracks here.
3600743	3622471	Um, anyways, um, Games for Windows Live is getting an update in November as well, and of course, you know, normally Xbox Live, those are spring and fall updates, so it sounds around the, about around the time, um, we'll be seeing an update for Live as well on 360, but Games for Windows Live will become 1.2, and with that, there's gonna be some improvements to, um,
3623618	3624158	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3654455	3660622	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3675560	3676880	Thank you for watching!
3693685	3706015	And according to the site this originally ran on, quote, it's stylistically and gameplay-wise, the game has abandoned the dark edginess of the last two titles in favor of a fantastical cross between the Sands of Time, Ico, and Zelda.
3706956	3710038	I don't know, when you put it that way, it sounds a little fanboyish to me, but you never know.
3710058	3714422	At the same time, though, that's about the time I think that the Prince of Persia movies are supposed to be coming out as well.
3715481	3718163	I mean, obviously the Prince of Persia series is not a dead series.
3718363	3721466	So, big fat duh that there's another game coming out.
3721866	3724107	But is it a prequel?
3724148	3725288	That could be interesting.
3725609	3726309	And who knows?
3726369	3727730	Maybe it's actually the movie version.
3728150	3729912	Because maybe they're going in a different direction with the movie.
3729952	3733454	Maybe it isn't based on existing storyline and these games are there to support the movie.
3734315	3734635	Who knows?
3734976	3736797	Theories abound everywhere.
3736977	3738478	But we don't know for sure until next year.
3740560	3741801	Well, this is...
3742967	3746629	Fairly interesting as far as something that may or may not be.
3747270	3755876	But one of SNK's, to me, one of the games that I like the best from them, Magician Lord, has an ESRB rating.
3757497	3761579	So it most likely will not be only for Japan.
3762300	3766002	We could see it coming out on the virtual console for Wii very soon.
3766162	3766823	Fuck yeah.
3767343	3768464	That's what I got to say about that.
3769528	3780560	Basically, you go through all these different levels that can turn your character into different types of, I guess, elemental type characters.
3781381	3782302	So, it's a pretty good game.
3782703	3784224	Magician Lord is pretty hardcore awesome.
3787368	3787528	Cool.
3789127	3791549	Anyways, other sorts of awesome.
3792250	3796954	There was before a problem with the Bioshock PC version, of course.
3797014	3801558	People getting pissed off that you can only have three different activations available for that.
3801618	3806082	Well, now they have a brand new tool that's been released officially.
3807003	3815871	It's an activation revoke tool and will allow you to revoke some of the activations that you have so that if you want to install on a different PC...
3817047	3817607	You can do that.
3817808	3831034	It's basically allow you to race and reload copies of Bioshock onto your PC as many times as you want without using up one of your activation tokens provided you don't make any major changes to your current hardware.
3831954	3835676	And, of course, the tool is downloadable on the Cult of Rapture website.
3837097	3838137	So, awesome.
3838157	3839738	At least that they're trying to fix some stuff.
3840686	3841387	Thank you for watching.
3841407	3841788	See you next time.
3853343	3855324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3874815	3878338	Hey, I want to call in sometime, but I'm just not around on Sunday nights.
3878378	3879098	It's a bad time for me.
3879379	3882281	Don't forget, we have voicemail there at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3882301	3886704	So if you wanted to call in tonight, call in and leave a voicemail, and we'll try to play it on next week's show.
3886984	3889867	The only reason we haven't been playing voicemails lately is because we haven't been getting a lot.
3890167	3891788	But if we get some good ones, we'll definitely play them.
3892028	3898273	Just my only advice, try to just keep it under two minutes because when you go on and ramble and ramble, it makes us want to play it less because, you know,
3898666	3900127	The show is for us to ramble and ramble.
3900187	3900307	No.
3900867	3902508	We want you guys to definitely have a say as well.
3902548	3903488	So the Skype line is there.
3903568	3906769	Or our email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
3906809	3910531	And apologies to our live listeners who got cut off tonight.
3910951	3911571	What can I say?
3911671	3913312	The show was just all kinds of broken tonight.
3913632	3915733	It's like this whole year old now quit curse.
3916593	3917494	I don't know what else to say.
3917874	3920975	But we will go around and get some last minute stories, of which I'm sure Loki's got to have some.
3921355	3921536	Yeah.
3921896	3922436	What's up?
3922636	3923817	Anyways, let's see here.
3923857	3926738	There's some interesting pictures coming out from Postal 3.
3928249	3940597	One of which features a new gun, apparently, that's going to be in the game, which features a guy's hand up a badger's ass, and he's firing a badger gun, apparently.
3940797	3943058	It's like Laser Badger or something like that.
3943518	3947481	So this is, and I've got to show this in studio here real quick.
3947721	3948882	Well, you don't have to.
3949062	3949462	Yes, I do.
3949742	3955986	Destructoid ran a little interview based on that, and I've got to say, I was already going to buy this game
3956758	3960961	I'm thinking I may buy two copies of this game because it's fucking awesome looking.
3964804	3966205	Go runny with scissors.
3966305	3969007	Yeah, well, they'll be on the badger's ass.
3969568	3974972	Hey, I got to respect the fact that they leave nothing to chance as far as offending people.
3975512	3978014	Good luck getting this past the ESRB, though.
3978054	3979035	That's all I got to say.
3980796	3981717	Other fun stuff.
3982441	3985644	There's going to be a new tool that's... I can't... Hold on.
3985664	3994312	I just have to say I can't wait for the YouTube where somebody's going to film themselves doing this to the badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, badger, mushroom, mushroom.
3995112	3999096	Like, seriously, let's take some over-unders on how long before those YouTubes show up.
4000878	4002159	I say they show up before the game.
4002279	4005282	Now that I've said that, somebody's going to take that picture and put it on YouTube.
4005502	4006603	Send us the link when you get it done.
4007773	4012995	Now, also, Mac's console has some pictures up of a brand new device.
4013095	4019898	It's an adapter to let you use HDMI inputs on your first generation Xbox 360.
4020819	4022299	Of course, the ones without HDMI.
4022739	4027141	And this is from the XCM 1080i HDMI.
4027241	4030703	It's shaped like a disc, and it plugs into the back of your...
4032928	4034409	360, where the normal AV stuff goes.
4034969	4038212	And we'll do HDMI out, and we'll also do DVI out.
4038332	4041274	So that's pretty fucking awesome that that's going to be available.
4042515	4047619	The other thing, there's a Phantom Hourglass DS bundle that's appeared on internet retail sites.
4048860	4056686	This is for the UK, so it's a nice silver color with, looks like some silk screens of Zelda...
4057865	4062206	from Phantom Hourglass and also the Zelda Phantom Hourglass logo.
4062786	4064947	So that's kind of neat and that's probably coming soon.
4065607	4082190	And also if you are pre-ordering Super Mario Galaxy and you want a free pre-order coin, just make sure you pre-order your copies at Amazon, Circuit City, Fred Meyers, Fry's Electronics, Game Crazy GameStop, Kmart, and many others.
4083711	4085391	Pretty much every single store out there, so
4086872	4088073	Yeah, that's awesome.
4088813	4110744	And finally, and I'm sure you're going to hear this about the time that this podcast is released, some wonderful information, which was going to be for our live listeners, but since they're not with us, I'll just save it for the Part B. There is, each year, the ESA does kind of a, I guess a...
4112495	4114876	Charity Drive with games.
4114976	4121640	Last year, Sony got together and put some games, a PlayStation 2 collection together with a couple games.
4122100	4130244	Now, and this will be announced officially on Tuesday, and it's actually what's going to be is three games.
4131005	4133806	Robbie Bach of the ESA will announce the Holiday Bundle.
4133846	4138949	It's going to feature three Xbox 360 games, including Cars, what was his...
4140940	4143744	Car's Open Season and Fusion Frenzy 2, all for $29.99.
4145486	4151593	And the proceeds will go to basically helping the ESA.
4153840	4154501	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4177279	4187347	To deliver this program, the game publishers unite together to work through issues such as waiving royalties, packaging costs, etc.
4187407	4189528	in order to maximize charitable contribution.
4189568	4197955	Last year, Sony delivered a bundle for the ESA, and this year, Microsoft has agreed to create a three-game bundle to sell at retail with the proceeds going to the ESA charity.
4200877	4201297	Awesome.
4201337	4203499	Then you'll probably see that in stores on the 23rd.
4205641	4205941	All right.
4206516	4208977	Well, I guess that's it for the show.
4209037	4210818	Unfortunately, our stream never came back up.
4210918	4214279	So if one of you that's still in chat, DarkSakura, I don't know, just let them know.
4214339	4215619	Unfortunately, we've wrapped the show.
4216320	4218940	And unfortunately, I'll just have to come back next week or download the show on Tuesday.
4218981	4222582	But we thank them for sticking out, any of those folks that were still around, hoping we'd come back up.
4223002	4225083	But unfortunately, the computer is screwed up.
4225523	4227644	And now I have this dialog box on my screen that will not go away.
4227704	4229564	This is just, oh, my God.
4231805	4233106	Somebody put a gun in this computer.
4233166	4233526	It's done.
4233866	4234106	All right.
4235248	4240330	So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up tonight's broken show.
4254906	4255947	I don't know about the other two games.
4256067	4256327	All right.
4256367	4258628	Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4258668	4262671	Chris, thank you very much for being here, even if now you think you're some type of bad luck charm.
4263011	4263731	But I don't care.
4263792	4264892	We still love having you here.
4265052	4265693	And come back.
4266133	4266433	Damn it.
4266793	4267074	I am.
4267174	4267794	And I didn't tell you.
4267814	4268895	I'm going to Disneyland next week.
4269315	4270015	So I'll be thinking of you.
4270135	4270456	Whore.
4270656	4270776	No.
4271816	4273077	Get lots of pictures on the teacups.
4273277	4273558	I will.
4274058	4275078	Me and Extifer are going.
4275399	4275539	Aw.
4275719	4276599	That'll be fun.
4276740	4278240	He hasn't been in a long, long time.
4278300	4281202	So I'm going to make him go on that Ferris wheel that sways back and forth.
4281242	4281723	He's going to cry.
4281823	4282183	It'll be fun.
4282543	4283924	Yeah, I won't go on that.
4284004	4289267	But yeah, you're probably going to see a lot more of me until March because I'm going to be moving out there.
4290048	4292709	And hopefully you'll be able to hear me on my podcast.
4293890	4298993	Oh, which just goes to further prove everybody has a freaking podcast.
4299013	4299713	Exactly.
4300074	4300654	We were first.
4300714	4301254	God damn it.
4302115	4302395	All right.
4303156	4304116	Thank you very much for being here.
4304136	4304416	You're welcome.
4304436	4305677	Puppy, thanks for coming back.
4305917	4310440	And I'm glad you got to talk more this week, even if sort of, even though there was like
4311608	4313769	Only two microphones, but what can you do?
4314310	4316071	It's like your shirt says, Booched.
4316551	4317532	The show is Booched.
4318092	4319012	Is that a Puzzle Pirates thing?
4319032	4321094	Yes, it is a Puzzle Pirates shirt.
4321134	4322514	Wow, what does Booched mean?
4323095	4323915	You screwed up?
4324035	4325076	Yeah, that's basically what it means.
4325396	4327557	This is like the worst rating you get on a puzzle.
4328518	4330239	Oh, okay.
4330619	4333361	Well, that was a very appropriate shirt to wear to the show.
4334001	4334521	I have to see.
4334841	4338604	There was another article I was reading on Destructoid that they had...
4339474	4346320	is this game called Animal Kaiser and it's basically where you can pit different animals against each other in like deathmatch in the arcade.
4346680	4350483	So they have snake versus black panther and Indian cobra.
4351584	4354866	And it's awesome because you can just pick all sorts of different animals to fight each other.
4355387	4358269	I swear to God, just pick a black mom, we'll yield one every time.
4358589	4363954	I swear to God, there's like an entire video game craze that is just dead set on pissing PETA off.
4364614	4366356	And as far as I'm concerned, have at them.
4367096	4368057	PETA can kiss my ass.
4368942	4371624	Hey, PETA came back with Super Chick Sisters or whatever that was.
4371684	4373725	It was actually kind of cute, I gotta say.
4374646	4381630	But that was, again, I'm visiting... Oh, now what?
4382471	4385072	Loki, this will double as your final thought.
4386293	4389415	They have a shark versus a lion.
4389735	4391997	That is the coolest shit I have ever seen.
4392017	4394979	I gotta see this here.
4395362	4398204	They've got to have this in the United States.
4398364	4402087	I know this is one of those quirky... Okay.
4402107	4402747	We need to see.
4402767	4404288	Sorry.
4404308	4405209	Sorry, I gotta... Brother.
4415694	4419997	There's a shark and a freaking lion.
4420277	4423879	The shark is out of water and is kicking the lion's ass.
4424199	4425160	How is that possible?
4426060	4427221	The fucking shark won!
4427841	4429002	If this is why Smash Bros.
4429022	4430203	got delayed, then I'm okay with it.
4431844	4434765	Seriously, the new third-party character is being announced.
4435046	4438888	Shark and lion.
4439148	4440689	DarkSakura, your final thought.
4441970	4443711	First of all, everyone's still PMing me.
4445342	4447064	on chat.
4448927	4452171	My final thought is bitches.
4453633	4453913	All right.
4453953	4454814	Referring to work.
4455495	4459840	And my final thought is sorry the show is broken tonight and you get what you pay for.
4459901	4460762	But thank you anyway.
4461603	4462063	Thank you.
4462143	4462364	What?
4462384	4464086	What do you mean I'm doing it wrong?
4468002	4469422	Can we just stop the show now?
