5800	11800	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
11800	15000	for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19600	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19600	21600	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
21600	25100	We are live here on this Sunday evening, October the 7th, 2007,
25100	29100	for part B of our 250th weekly episode.
29100	31600	That's 250 weeks in a row, give or take a few.
31600	33600	It's applause.
33600	36600	We're testing out our new applause light tonight, everybody. It's great.
36600	40100	It just means that we've had nothing to do on a Sunday night now for how long?
40100	41100	I know.
41100	43600	I think we've gotten emails about this before, like,
43600	46600	how do you guys manage to motivate yourselves to do it every week?
46600	48600	And we just kind of go, well, we just do it, you know?
48600	50600	It's our club.
50600	53600	Some people go to, you know, knitting clubs.
53600	55100	Some people go to church.
55100	57100	Do or do not. There is no try.
57100	59600	Some people go to poker. We do a radio show on the internet.
59600	61600	Some people go to bingo.
61600	63600	Some people go to a bar and get pissed, by the way.
63600	65600	Anyhow, back to the news.
65600	67600	So bungee. Bungee bungee bungee bungee.
67600	69600	Some people play Halo religiously every Sunday night.
69600	72600	I like the word bungee and I like saying it repeatedly.
72600	74600	It's like balls.
74600	77600	Just one of those words that makes you laugh.
77600	78600	Well.
78600	83600	Anyway, bungee has decided to be independent once again.
83600	85600	You know what this means?
85600	90600	This means we could very well get bungee games on a system that isn't an Xbox.
90600	93600	They could go back to Mac games.
93600	95600	Whoa.
95600	98600	Halo for the iMac.
98600	100600	You know, actually, that would be kind of rad.
100600	102600	And you know what? It would look better.
102600	105600	It would probably look better.
105600	109600	Because what does graphics better, Mac or PC?
109600	110600	The Mac.
110600	112600	Exactly.
112600	114600	That should be determined, actually.
114600	116600	Not. No. No.
116600	118600	This battle is not happening tonight.
118600	124600	So Microsoft is going to continue keeping up with the Halo franchise.
124600	127600	And continue to partner with bungee on games.
127600	132600	However, we could have another rare on our hands.
132600	135600	So Killer Instinct 3 by bungee?
135600	136600	Ooh.
136600	138600	I guess that wouldn't really happen, would it?
138600	140600	Dude, I would love another Killer Instinct. Wouldn't that be great?
140600	143600	That's a whole other company's issues, though.
143600	145600	That's a whole other box of ex-lax.
145600	147600	I want to say I heard that there's some part of the deal, though,
147600	150600	where Microsoft gets first look at the games bungee puts out.
150600	154600	So it's kind of like, well, we're setting you free, okay?
154600	157600	So we're letting the hoe leave the bedroom.
157600	163600	But she's still got to turn tricks for me whenever I want, basically, is what it is.
163600	165600	It's like the pimp and his hoe.
165600	166600	Kind of, yeah. That's what I'm saying.
166600	168600	So the hoe's still got to put out when I need it, right?
168600	169600	Yeah.
169600	170600	So, yeah.
170600	174600	I mean, then that makes me think, what in their right mind is Microsoft going to pass on?
174600	176600	Because bungee makes a lot, a lot of hits.
176600	180600	You know, I think the only way they're going to pass is if bungee says,
180600	183600	hey, we want to make a game starring Mario,
183600	189600	or we want to make a game starring, what's a Sony franchise, Ratchet and Clank?
189600	190600	Spyro?
190600	192600	Spyro, yes. We won't make a Spyro game.
192600	193600	Well, that's not a Sony franchise anymore.
193600	194600	Banjo-Kazooie?
194600	195600	No, anyhow.
195600	197600	No, that was Nintendo.
197600	199600	That was Nintendo.
199600	200600	Smash Bandicoot.
200600	201600	Sweet Tooth.
201600	202600	There you go.
202600	203600	Sweet Tooth.
203600	204600	Darkknight in chat.
204600	207600	Chat.orangemanstrated.com says, Marathon. K, thanks.
207600	210600	And GS191 says, I think it's time to revisit the Marathon series.
210600	214600	Rama says, and Halo was originally developed for the PC before Microsoft bought them.
214600	215600	Hmm.
215600	216600	All right.
216600	217600	Your comments in chat.
217600	220600	Chat.orangemanstrated.com, when we tape live every Sunday night.
220600	225600	Anyways, so as we've been talking for the past few weeks now,
225600	231600	there's this new SKU that people keep talking about, the Xbox 360 Arcade console.
231600	234600	Well, it's been listed on a few retail sites now.
234600	236600	Toys R Us being one of them.
236600	238600	Another one being Amazon.com.
238600	242600	Both having it showing as being released on the 23rd.
242600	245600	But, of course, I'm sure that means that it's not coming out, right?
245600	247600	Because it must be fake.
247600	251600	A rumor and stuff, since all this information has been constantly leaking out about it.
251600	256600	For those who may not remember, it's basically the replacement for the core system.
256600	262600	It will come with an HDMI port, a wireless controller, a 256 megabyte memory unit,
262600	266600	and five Xbox Live Arcade games on a single disk,
266600	272600	including Booboo, Rocket, Pac-Man, Uno, Feeding Frenzy, and Luxor 2.
272600	277600	All for the same price as the current core system, which is $279.99 in the U.S.
277600	281600	Uh...
281600	286600	Yeah, you will not be surprised to see this come out.
286600	291600	Yeah, this story just goes to prove that rumors about Microsoft are always true.
291600	294600	I mean, right? Because this rumor about the arcade thing has been going around forever.
294600	298600	Forever, and they have screenshots taken from the website.
298600	299600	Yeah.
299600	301600	That's what I was saying with the Namco.
301600	304600	It's like, oh, let's take five games that are each a megabyte and put it on a DVD.
304600	308600	It's like, ahh!
308600	313600	Let's not bring up Namco in secrets. That's a sore subject for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
313600	318600	Because all Namco rumors are true, too, but they don't want you to know that.
318600	323600	Anyhow, because I'm sure that certain games aren't coming to a certain platform next week or anything.
323600	328600	They'll be rolling tether consoles soon, I'm sure.
328600	333600	Moving on. Pardon the man behind the curtain there. Pay no attention to him.
333600	338600	Going back to Halo 3. That's right. Halo 3 is in the news, and we love Halo 3.
338600	341600	What's the hatred for Halo 3 over here, Casper?
341600	346600	I don't hate Halo 3. It's just a boring generic space fighter game that I'm just indifferent about.
346600	347600	Haha!
347600	348600	Says Metroid.
348600	350600	Yeah, but have you played the multiplayer game?
350600	352600	It's not generic, thank you, huh?
352600	353600	Oh, yeah.
353600	356600	Oh, God. Are we going to get into the Halo 3?
356600	358600	Yeah, that's why 73% of people voted for Samus.
358600	366600	Well, I just want to say this. On the Japanese software charts this week, Halo 3 actually managed to top the charts in Japan.
366600	370600	Now, keep in mind, though, that if you separate two of the Pokemon games and these Pokemon games,
370600	374600	if you separate the two Pokemon games, then Halo 3 was number one.
374600	378600	But this is just kind of a nyah nyah nyah for people who said that Halo would not do well in Japan,
378600	380600	and the Japanese hate Halo, and blah blah blah.
380600	384600	I would like to actually say, because I really suck at Halo,
384600	390600	I got my ass kicked by a Japanese player the other day on Halo, and it made me feel, well,
390600	394600	I mean, every time I play Halo, I feel inadequate, to be honest.
394600	396600	But you do have the power of the donut armor.
396600	400600	Yes, I have the pink armor, so that's always awesome.
400600	403600	And I had to show Rob donut in red versus blue last night.
403600	410600	Halo 3 moved 59,000 copies, but it should be said, Pokemon's mysterious dungeon Toki moved 55,000 copies,
410600	415600	but there's another version called Yami which moved 46,000 copies, but they're counted separately.
415600	416600	So, there you have it.
416600	418600	By the way, PlayStation 3 is in the top ten.
418600	422600	Elder Scrolls Oblivion is number nine on the Japanese charts.
422600	426600	I think that's also newsworthy as well, to point out that that Japanese translation is doing pretty well,
426600	429600	when it's a very, quote unquote, American RPG.
429600	431600	Doing pretty well in Japan.
431600	432600	But it's an RPG.
432600	434600	Yeah, it is. So, good times.
434600	443600	Well, something that is going to be coming out in the UK on the 9th of November is Gears of War PC,
443600	446600	which we all know was an Xbox 360 title.
446600	453600	There are five new single player parts of the game, new campaigns.
453600	457600	Or, I'm sorry, there are new places to explore in the main campaign,
457600	466600	and there's also an encounter with the, what's it called, Bromack, that's from the end of Act 1 in the 360 version.
466600	469600	I guess it's this big dinosaur.
469600	470600	I'd never played it.
470600	472600	It's a big creature thing.
472600	474600	They had it, like, in the trailers and stuff.
474600	475600	Okay.
475600	482600	Well, they've also, of course, expanded the multiplayer options.
482600	484600	They have a bunch of new maps.
484600	487600	There's also, they've improved graphic quality and resolution,
487600	496600	so that if your machine is beefy enough, it'll make it look sweet.
496600	499600	They don't have, though, the four player co-op.
499600	503600	I'd like to ask a question and start a little fight here in the chat room and in the studio,
503600	507600	because this is always fun, a little bit of controversy, speaking of Gears of War.
507600	511600	Since both these games came out this year, which game do you think is better overall?
511600	515600	Start with Loki. Gears of War or Halo 3?
515600	516600	And why?
516600	519600	I would say Halo 3 just because it's a lot more fun of a game.
519600	524600	Gears of War was really fucking hard, especially if you don't play first person shooters a lot.
524600	527600	You probably wouldn't like the multiplayer in it.
527600	530600	And the multiplayer is kind of, I don't know, I didn't like the multiplayer for Gears of War.
530600	535600	I didn't play it that much either, though, so I can't really judge it too much.
535600	542600	Halo is fun. Now, if you're into just straight graphics, then Gears of War fucking kicks the crap out of Halo 3.
542600	547600	And also, too, you know, a bit of semantics here.
547600	549600	Gears of War came out last year.
549600	551600	Oh, did it? I thought it was like November last year.
551600	554600	Oh, damn it. Never mind.
554600	558600	Well, then wait, but they're still out within a year of each other, so the question still works.
558600	559600	So there you go.
559600	561600	Well, how about this?
561600	568600	If you were a completely new player sitting down and you played through Gears of War and you played through Halo, what would be your opinion? How's that?
568600	572600	My thing is I love co-op mode in both of the games.
572600	576600	I think they both have a stellar co-op mode, and more games should have co-op mode in them because it makes the game fun.
576600	578600	Quit falling asleep over there, Eddie.
578600	584600	But as far as I just didn't like the cover system in Gears of War, so Halo 3 is more of the game for me personally.
584600	585600	I didn't like the cover thing.
585600	586600	Say what you will.
586600	588600	That's that.
588600	592600	Alright, I'm sorry, we're putting the Nintendo fanboy to sleep, so we better move on with some news.
592600	595600	So sorry to inconvenience you.
595600	600600	Maybe we'll just get some completely random news, Loki, to wake Eddie up over there.
600600	610600	Well, something very inconceivable has happened, and they have decided to make a Princess Bride game,
610600	619600	which is going to be releasing a demo version of it to coincide with the 20th anniversary DVD of it,
619600	626600	and it will be the True Love and High Adventure, the official Princess Bride game.
626600	635600	Only one little problem, though, is that it is going to be a casual game, at least by the sounds of it so far.
635600	640600	Wouldn't it be more appropriate to call this game Wuv Twi-Wuv?
640600	643600	Mallage.
643600	647600	But it is going to be a PC game, and it's going to be probably a downloadable title.
647600	649600	Is it like point and click?
649600	650600	No idea.
650600	653600	Oh, I was just asking if it was like point and click, or what's the interface style?
653600	655600	Nope, no one knows yet.
655600	667600	It's being put out by, let's see here, well they said World Wide Biggies, which I've never heard of them.
667600	670600	So Rob's choking?
670600	672600	We're not going to go there.
672600	682600	No, honestly, I've never heard of World Wide Biggies, which can be found at www.biggies.com.
682600	689600	I don't know. I'm not familiar with any of their games, so I can't see if it's going to be good.
689600	697600	Alright, well, you know, sleep all you want through the Halo and the Gears of War news, Eddie, but you've got to admit this is good.
697600	699600	This is Halo being used for a good cause.
699600	702600	This is a group called the Cave Girls who put this together.
702600	704600	No, seriously, it's like a gaming group called the Cave Girls who put this together.
704600	711600	It's a tournament called the Fight Like a Girl Halo tournament, and it's being held this year on October 20th, and it's on Xbox Live.
711600	714600	It's a $10 entry fee. Anybody can sign up and it takes place.
714600	717600	All the proceeds go towards the fight against breast cancer.
717600	722600	So the tournament is being used to raise money for breast cancer awareness, which is pretty awesome.
722600	724600	There's two different tournaments they're having.
724600	727600	There's a single elimination and double team, two versus two.
727600	733600	And if you want to check out their forums at CaveGirlForums.com, they really go down the list of everything that it is,
733600	736600	and you can actually donate your entry fee there online.
736600	737600	Pretty neat there.
737600	740600	Very creative idea for a good cause.
740600	743600	I would hope that maybe Microsoft, this will get on their radar.
743600	745600	Maybe it'll be a blip on their radar.
745600	748600	Maybe they'll advertise it on the site or something.
748600	750600	Is it Cave Girls with a G?
750600	753600	No, it's just like a cave G-I-R-L.
753600	757600	Like a no riot girl G-R-R thing going on there or whatever.
757600	758600	Girl.
758600	760600	So there you have it.
760600	761600	Girl.
761600	767600	Well, the resident O-L-R Cave Girl is going to open up the mailbag right now.
767600	774600	And you notice how she responded with a very cave girl.
774600	779600	Hey, don't make me get out of this club and beat you.
779600	786600	When you send in your e-mails every week to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, our very own dark Sakura.
786600	787600	Even if she is a cave girl, we still love her.
787600	791600	She reads the e-mails and we respond to them.
791600	793600	So open up the mailbag and let's see what's there.
793600	795600	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
795600	797600	Our Tetsuya says Rob's going to get clubbed.
797600	799600	First up, your mom.
799600	801600	Last night.
801600	802600	Ooh.
802600	803600	Ooh.
803600	810600	Anyway, we have an e-mail from Picaruno.
810600	812600	Is that how it's pronounced?
812600	813600	I believe so.
813600	814600	Hi all.
814600	815600	Hi.
815600	816600	Who's all?
816600	819600	I'm writing in to tell you about something I verified this week.
819600	824600	So you know that Sony opened the PC version of the PlayStation Store in Japan only for now, right?
824600	830600	Well, there's something decidedly dodgy about how they check to see if you're allowed to access it.
830600	835600	When I tried to access the store, I managed to see the front page in usage FAQs.
835600	843600	But since I tried to click on a game, I got an English message saying PlayStation Store is not available in the selected country or region.
843600	847600	This is rather odd seeing as, you know, I live in Japan.
847600	853600	So I took a screenshot showing the error message along with an IP geolocation result.
853600	855600	It's on Flickr.
855600	863600	Now you might be thinking that since I was using a Mac, the error message was a badly worded way of saying use Windows, fool.
863600	866600	But no, even on Windows, I get the exact same error.
866600	870600	Then Sakurina suggested I try changing my system's language settings to Japanese.
870600	872600	Lo and behold, it now works.
872600	875600	There are several reasons why this is retarded.
875600	880600	First, regional settings on a machine should make no difference to a website.
880600	889600	And also to point out something, when the Sarah Jane Avengers was first coming out and they had all the clips up and everything on the BBC's website,
889600	892600	they actually had it blocked by IP, not by your language.
892600	898600	This is what Sony should have done so that you couldn't see the website outside of the UK.
898600	903600	But anyway, second is borderline racist as it implies.
903600	909600	Anyone who doesn't have their computer set to Japanese, i.e. native Japanese people, shouldn't have access to the site.
909600	914600	Seriously, I'm a registered resident of Japan and I have a legal right to access the store.
914600	918600	It's ridiculous that I'm barred because I have my computer set in a language I'm more comfortable with.
918600	926600	Does this mean that any native Japanese person can access the Japan store from wherever they are in the world just because of their computer's language settings?
926600	927600	How dare you, Sony.
927600	933600	You know what I would love for you to do is change your settings to Japanese.
933600	940600	And I don't think you should be able to do this given where you live, but I would love to have somebody else anywhere else in the country,
940600	946600	anywhere else in the world, set their language settings to Japanese and try to order to ship outside of Japan.
946600	952600	I was going to ask, if that's all you have to do, then me living in the US, could I just change my language to Japanese and do it?
952600	956600	The only other thing I think of, and this is because I've ordered stuff through Japanese websites,
956600	964600	is that they actually, the way that the postal system works there, it has it all set by your postal code.
964600	970600	And it's set by your postal code, what city you live in, and what section of the city you live in.
970600	977600	It's really, really difficult because it's set so completely different than the US system that you're not going to really be able to...
977600	980600	If the fields are preloaded that way, then you're not going to be able to do it.
980600	984600	Huh. Well, good luck on your quest, Picaruno.
984600	986600	Seriously.
986600	990600	So, next email up is...
990600	999600	You mentioned the orange box in the last episode, and it just occurred to me that I should send you guys my anti-orange box rant from a couple weeks ago.
999600	1001600	Okay?
1001600	1005600	The rant. Valve and the orange box. Valve, you suck.
1005600	1008600	That shall be the thesis of this rant.
1008600	1012600	Wow, this is a rant with a college education.
1012600	1017600	I log in to Steam a few days ago, and I see pre-order Half-Life 2, Episode 2.
1017600	1020600	Now, I'm pumped. I love Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2, Episode 1.
1020600	1022600	So, I click to pre-order, and I see this.
1022600	1029600	Pre-order the orange box. The orange box contains Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2, Episode 1, Half-Life 2, Episode 2, Team Fortress 2, and Portal.
1029600	1035600	So, instead of the $20 that was advertised when Valve first announced the ship date for Half-Life 2, Episode 2, TF2, and Portal,
1035600	1041600	they added two games I already own and love into the package, cranked the price up to $50, and forced me to buy them.
1041600	1043600	Again.
1043600	1045600	I'm not pleased by this.
1045600	1051600	Now, I wouldn't mind this normally, but this is the one way Valve has announced they're selling Half-Life 2, Episode 2.
1051600	1053600	Why is that?
1053600	1057600	This is the point where some of you might say that they did this with Half-Life 2's release.
1057600	1059600	Now, I know I have a special edition DVD.
1059600	1063600	The difference is Half-Life 2 completely upgraded the graphics system for its packaged older games,
1063600	1068600	Half-Life and Counter-Strike, now known as Counter-Strike Source and Half-Life Source.
1068600	1069600	Ugh.
1069600	1075600	Now, some of the smart people may be like, wow, a company like Valve couldn't have screwed up their release this much.
1075600	1078600	Oh, they think they didn't, but they have a solution.
1078600	1080600	Gifting.
1080600	1085600	It turns out that if I buy the orange box, I can give away Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2, Episode 1 to people.
1085600	1087600	What happens to them if they want to buy Half-Life 2, Episode 2?
1087600	1094600	Are they going to release it so that you can buy Episode 2 alone, or are they going to do it launch day, or are they going to make us wait?
1094600	1101600	At one point, they were going to have the black box, which didn't have Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, but that was axed.
1101600	1103600	Ugh.
1103600	1105600	Okay.
1105600	1110600	I'll probably break down and dish out the extra cash, because I absolutely adore the series, and must know what happens next,
1110600	1117600	so if anyone wants a free copy of Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, I will probably post a follow-up regarding if I break down or not.
1117600	1123600	Either way, Valve has gone out of their way to piss off the core audience in hopes of increasing their gamership.
1123600	1125600	Well done, Valve. Well done.
1125600	1127600	And that is from...
1127600	1129600	There's still tons of people excited about this coming out, though.
1129600	1131600	That's from Super Al.
1131600	1136600	But that is, you know, nobody ever enjoys those type of bait-and-switch things, where it's like, you know,
1136600	1139600	hey, you can get it for this low price, but oh, never mind, we don't want to do that anymore,
1139600	1141600	because we thought of a way to make more money out of it.
1141600	1143600	That's just capitalism at its finest.
1143600	1145600	Oh, hell yeah.
1145600	1148600	So, the last email, because we didn't get very many.
1148600	1150600	Greetings, OLR peoples!
1150600	1151600	Greetings!
1151600	1152600	Ow, my neck hurts.
1152600	1154600	This is from Pooface, by the way.
1154600	1156600	I love that name.
1156600	1158600	Hi, Pooface!
1158600	1163600	On last week's show, you were talking about the asshole Mario levels on YouTube.
1163600	1167600	Well, there is a download of a file you can use to patch Super Mario World ROM
1167600	1170600	and turn it into the Kaizo Mario World Game, a.k.a. Asshole Mario.
1170600	1172600	I downloaded it and played it.
1172600	1177600	I was trying for nearly an hour on just the first part where you have to jump the Bullet Bills across the enormous jump.
1177600	1183600	I still haven't gotten it, and I have no clue how many vulgarities I yelled at while trying to attempt this mass torture device.
1183600	1186600	Download it and give it a try if you're feeling brave.
1186600	1188600	Okay, I don't even need to download Asshole Mario,
1188600	1193600	because you know what I did download this week on Virtual Console is Super Mario Bros. 2, the Japanese version.
1193600	1195600	Which is almost asshole.
1195600	1199600	Okay, that's a pretty asshole Mario right there.
1199600	1204600	I was shouting obscenities, and I barely got to World 1-2, and I kept dying and having to continue.
1204600	1206600	I mean, that game is hard.
1206600	1208600	But the sad part is... I'm not dumb.
1208600	1210600	Don't say that. You hurt my feelings.
1210600	1214600	We got another email in, however I'm not going to read it because it was fairly rude.
1214600	1215600	Save it for next week.
1215600	1216600	About one of our listeners.
1216600	1217600	Save it for next week.
1217600	1218600	I'm not going to read it at all.
1218600	1223600	Real quick though, I want to say that the sad part about it is I remember playing this game
1223600	1228600	back when it was a part of Mario All-Stars on the Super Nintendo, and I totally beat it.
1228600	1232600	No problem. It took me like a day to beat it. No problem.
1232600	1236600	And now it's like my video game skills have deteriorated with age, and that just makes me sad.
1236600	1238600	Okay, you're getting old, Rob.
1238600	1239600	So which is harder, Rob?
1239600	1241600	Maybe some asper cream to combat the arthritis.
1241600	1242600	Shut up.
1242600	1248600	Which is harder, that or the first level of Kid Icarus?
1248600	1254600	Actually, seeing as I got to World 2 and Kid Icarus eventually, it's probably that.
1254600	1256600	Terror, danger, horror.
1256600	1259600	I didn't even know there was a second level to Kid Icarus.
1259600	1264600	Kid Icarus, I only know the first level song, and it's like, wait a minute, did you beat the game?
1264600	1267600	What about you, smartass? Did you ever get to World 2?
1267600	1269600	I never played Kid Icarus.
1269600	1270600	You suck.
1270600	1271600	So no, I didn't.
1271600	1272600	I've beaten Kid Icarus.
1272600	1273600	Me too, when I was seven.
1273600	1274600	I beat Rygar.
1274600	1275600	Or no, I haven't been older than that.
1275600	1276600	Rygar is a great game.
1276600	1278600	Rygar is great except for the ending.
1278600	1282600	Now, if you beat Rygar, that's hardcore, because you could not save or password that game.
1282600	1283600	I know, that shit was hard.
1283600	1285600	You have to leave the Nintendo on overnight.
1285600	1286600	Oh, we did too.
1286600	1289600	And you know what else though, Bionic Commando with Hitler's brain blowing up.
1289600	1290600	That was great.
1290600	1291600	I never beat that game.
1291600	1293600	That game was so frickin' hard.
1293600	1294600	You know what game was frickin' hard?
1294600	1295600	It was Strider on the NES.
1295600	1297600	It was based off of the Japanese comics.
1297600	1299600	We need to pay tribute to video game endings at some point.
1299600	1300600	Yes, we do.
1300600	1301600	Good ones.
1301600	1303600	Not ones that are like, the end user game.
1303600	1307600	There actually was a funny YouTube clip, I want to say it showed up on Digg this week,
1307600	1309600	about really bad video game endings.
1309600	1311600	And it just was a bunch of bad video game endings back to back.
1311600	1312600	It was kind of funny.
1312600	1316600	I hate the ones where it's like, you can only get the good ending if you play in hard mode.
1316600	1318600	You know, I'm thinking, ah!
1318600	1319600	Wimp.
1319600	1320600	I am playing hard mode.
1320600	1321600	Wimp.
1321600	1324600	All right, well if you would like Dark Soccer to read your emails on air, send your emails
1324600	1326600	to mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.
1326600	1328600	Just keep it clean, and don't make them mean.
1328600	1329600	We don't like mean emails.
1329600	1332600	I don't want emails bad mouthing other listeners, so just drop it.
1332600	1334600	Unless you want to badmouth Loki.
1334600	1336600	Yeah, you can, you can.
1336600	1337600	Or Rice Princess.
1337600	1338600	Hey, shut up.
1338600	1340600	We need some good Rice Princess bashing emails.
1340600	1341600	Hey, no.
1341600	1342600	And Eddie bashing emails.
1342600	1345600	Eddie's fine, but not me.
1345600	1346600	All right.
1346600	1348600	Let's move on to some gaming news.
1348600	1354800	Anyways, it started out as an April Fool's joke from ThinkGeek, but now, due to popular
1354800	1357280	demand, they have gone ahead and made it.
1357280	1359280	It is the 8-bit tie.
1359280	1363800	It's a tie that looks like it's made out of pixels, and you can buy it for yourself for
1363800	1366640	the low, low price of $19.99.
1366640	1370960	It's available on their online store, and I guess it's gonna...
1370960	1378880	It's a way to get you some extra nerd cred, and it's a clip-on, by the way.
1378880	1383760	So 8-bit tie, that's kind of nifty.
1383760	1386320	All right.
1386320	1389360	I think it looks kind of cool.
1389360	1392000	I tried.
1392000	1396920	I think it would be funny to wear it to work one day, just randomly, and have people stare
1396920	1399520	at me going, what is wrong with you, because they don't already do that.
1399520	1401480	Oh, did you guys see it in the studio there?
1401480	1402480	Now, what do you think?
1402480	1403800	Would you wear that out in public?
1403800	1404960	Would you wear that to the bank?
1404960	1408880	Not to the bank, but yeah, I would actually probably wear that.
1408880	1411880	Because you're a nerd.
1411880	1414040	All right.
1414040	1419520	Well, something else that is not to be seen in public is new levels from the new Simpsons
1419520	1420520	game.
1420520	1424460	That is, if you're Rockstar, because Rockstar has their panties in a bunch because they're
1424460	1429720	upset that the Simpsons game dares to make fun of Grand Theft Auto with its own little
1429720	1432840	Grand Theft Scratchy game thing going on.
1432840	1437720	Apparently, some of the game's content had to be pulled because Rockstar was not happy
1437720	1439240	with the way the license was being used.
1439240	1442560	Now, to be fair, Rockstar is not the only one, apparently, but Rockstar is the only
1442560	1445560	one that's being called out by name.
1445560	1449680	So apparently, at Leipzig, there was actually a poster at the games convention in Germany,
1449680	1450680	right?
1450680	1453760	There was a poster with Grand Theft Scratchy that caught Rockstar's eye, and they asked
1453760	1454760	for it to be removed.
1454760	1459320	Now, on the other hand, Harmonix, they thought Satar Hero was funny.
1459320	1465940	So that is being left in the game, apparently.
1465940	1468280	So apparently, some companies don't love it.
1468280	1473200	Some people have a sense of humor, some do not.
1473200	1474200	Probably it's without poo.
1474200	1475200	I have no idea.
1475200	1476200	I know somebody who has an electric sitar.
1476200	1483320	But here's the thing is that I have this feeling, to Rockstar's credit, I have this feeling
1483320	1487600	that it's just one suit who has their feathers ruffled over this.
1487600	1491480	There's just one person whose words have been misconstrued to person versus person.
1491480	1493800	Because I bet most people at Rockstar have a sense of humor.
1493800	1498800	And it's sad that one person probably has made this whole thing get blown out of proportion.
1498800	1501640	But that's what happens when you're an executive and you say something silly.
1501640	1507100	Well the thing, I think that their thing behind it is that it's kind of, I mean, they're making
1507100	1512200	it so that it's very obvious that it's a parody of Grand Theft Auto.
1512200	1517240	I mean, Grand Theft's scratchy, they're not doing it like, you know, was it the game that
1517240	1522800	was in the actual Simpsons show, which I don't remember was, like, Grand Theft Auto or something.
1522800	1526880	You know, I don't remember where they called it, like, Death Hunter or something out, whatever.
1526880	1531120	But either way, you know, the fact that it's so similar is why they're probably pissed
1531120	1532120	off.
1532120	1535600	I mean, if it was a game that you knew was kind of like Grand Theft Auto but didn't actually
1535600	1538880	sound like Grand Theft Auto, they might not be so mad.
1538880	1541160	Yeah, but is it really going to cut into their profits?
1541160	1542440	No, it's not.
1542440	1545400	They're just weighing little pussies, but, you know, that's still...
1545400	1546840	Well, thank you for translating.
1546840	1548840	I appreciate that.
1548840	1551220	All right.
1551220	1555560	One more story before we get into tonight's episode of Match Game, which we promised for
1555560	1557840	this part of Part B. One more story.
1557840	1558840	One more story.
1558840	1559840	Hold your applause.
1559840	1560840	We're not into match games just yet.
1560840	1561840	We have one more story.
1561840	1563400	We do, don't we?
1563400	1564400	Mm-hmm.
1564400	1565400	Ooh.
1565400	1566400	We do.
1566400	1570920	Well, more joy for our European buddies is that Call of Duty 4 is going to have a special
1570920	1571920	edition.
1571920	1575920	You know, there was the beta test and all that went on.
1575920	1582040	So what's going to come with the special edition is two and a half hours of SCS footage with
1582040	1588640	the elite soldiers' history and their formation in the Second World War up to modern day conflicts,
1588640	1595520	a making of documentary, a level walkthrough by Infinity Ward, and a hardcover art book
1595520	1599520	with lots of the concept pictures.
1599520	1602920	And anyone playing on the PC has to download their strategy guide.
1602920	1605920	And that will also be available in the United States.
1605920	1607360	Cool.
1607360	1609080	Worldwide loving for Call of Duty fans.
1609080	1610520	But only on the Xbox 360.
1610520	1611520	All right.
1611520	1615480	Since it is episode number 250, we're going to play one of our very favorite games, the
1615480	1616480	Match Game.
1616480	1619480	But in order to play the Match Game, we need to get some contestants.
1619480	1623160	So we're going to take, if you would like to play the Match Game, if you're in our chat
1623160	1625240	room, just type me.
1625240	1626240	Only once.
1626240	1627840	If you type me more than once, you're not going to get picked.
1627840	1631520	But if you type me once, then we're going to let Puppy pick our contestant from chat
1631520	1633640	today because he hasn't really talked a lot in tonight's episode.
1633640	1634640	I know.
1634640	1635640	There's not enough microphones at once.
1635640	1636640	I know.
1636640	1638980	Sadly, our fourth microphone died, so we only have three microphones we're sharing.
1638980	1642080	So Puppy will pick the chat contestant soon.
1642080	1645360	But we also want to get somebody on the telephone.
1645360	1648920	So if you would like to give us a call and be our person on the phone to play, give us
1648920	1649920	a call right now.
1649920	1658880	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or our telephone number 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1658880	1661000	We're going to wait for somebody to call.
1661000	1665600	There's a little bit of a delay between when we say something and when people hear it.
1665600	1667480	Just now seeing all the me's jumping up the street.
1667480	1668480	Yes, meanwhile.
1668480	1669480	Okay, so Puppy sees all the me's.
1669480	1672960	So why don't you pick somebody who said me only once that gets to play Match Game tonight.
1672960	1673960	I'm going to roll.
1673960	1674960	I'm just going to be nerdy.
1674960	1677280	You're going to roll a D20?
1677280	1678280	I did, actually.
1678280	1679280	Oh my lord.
1679280	1680280	Wait, hold on.
1680280	1681280	Hold on.
1681280	1682280	We're getting a chatter.
1682280	1683280	Hold on.
1683280	1684280	Hi.
1684280	1685280	You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
1685280	1686280	Who's this?
1686280	1687280	Hello.
1687280	1688280	You're on.
1688280	1689280	Hi, Footy Monster.
1689280	1690280	Hi, Footy Monster.
1690280	1692480	How are you?
1692480	1693480	Is there a bad delay tonight?
1693480	1694480	Oh, it's probably...
1694480	1695480	I'm fine.
1695480	1696480	How are you guys doing?
1696480	1697480	Good.
1697480	1699840	It's probably the Operator 11 webcam causing us a little bit of a delay tonight.
1699840	1703480	So I have a feeling we might have to kill Op 11 in order to have a little lag.
1703480	1704480	I'm sorry, Operator 11.
1704480	1707800	We're going to have to say bye-bye to you guys to kill the lag.
1707800	1708800	But we'll see you next week.
1708800	1710400	We're going to be here on Operator 11 with more OrangeLoungeRadio.
1710400	1711680	Should we try calling back?
1711680	1712680	No, that's okay.
1712680	1716120	I'm pretty sure it's the lag is being caused from Operator 11, so we're just going to end
1716120	1717120	the feed there.
1717120	1718120	I can hear, but...
1718120	1719120	Ah.
1719120	1720120	Don't...
1720120	1721120	Why are you staring at that?
1721120	1722120	Meh.
1722120	1723120	All right.
1723120	1724120	Hopefully that'll help a little better.
1724120	1726880	Can you hear us now, Footy Monster?
1726880	1727880	I can hear you.
1727880	1728880	I don't know if...
1728880	1729880	All right.
1729880	1730880	There might just be a little bit of a delay.
1730880	1731880	That's okay.
1731880	1732880	We'll deal with it.
1732880	1733880	All right.
1733880	1734880	Puppy, who's playing from chat room?
1734880	1736880	My random roll of a die has picked escapists.
1736880	1737880	Escapists.
1737880	1741620	Oh, great, because escapists did the thing about the show tunes earlier, so I'm really
1741620	1744960	excited to see what escapists is going to do during match games.
1744960	1746120	So I'll send a message.
1746120	1747720	You win.
1747720	1749040	Stand by.
1749040	1750120	All right.
1750120	1754440	Do you know how the match game works, Footy Monster?
1754440	1755520	I believe so.
1755520	1760040	You say something, then blank, and have to figure out what that's supposed to be, right?
1760040	1761040	Yes.
1761040	1763240	We're going to say something with a blank, and you have to figure out what that something
1763240	1764240	is.
1764240	1767080	So I just want to make sure you can hear us okay, right?
1767080	1768080	I can hear you okay.
1768080	1769080	I think this is the grape.
1769080	1770080	I can hear you okay.
1770080	1771080	Okay.
1771080	1772080	Well, that's all right.
1772080	1774080	Now I see escapists has left chat, so I hope that's not a bad sign.
1774080	1775080	Let's see.
1775080	1776080	I want to make sure he's still there.
1776080	1779720	Are you going to play?
1779720	1784480	You left chat.
1784480	1785480	That's never happened before.
1785480	1786480	We have a player just leave.
1786480	1787480	Oh, shit.
1787480	1788480	I got picked.
1788480	1789480	Bye.
1789480	1790480	I'm bailing.
1790480	1791480	I scared him off.
1791480	1792480	Leaving.
1792480	1793480	See ya.
1793480	1794480	Oh, wait.
1794480	1796480	I got a prime message back.
1796480	1797480	Whoops.
1797480	1798480	Yep.
1798480	1799480	I'll still be there.
1799480	1800480	Okay.
1800480	1801480	Good.
1801480	1802480	All right.
1802480	1803480	What's over here?
1803480	1804480	It is tonight.
1804480	1805480	Footy monster versus escapists.
1805480	1806480	But before we get to it, we need to get some theme music and introduce our celebrities
1806480	1807480	tonight.
1807480	1812240	All right.
1812240	1816200	Celebrity number one tonight is the queen of the show who does not put up with shit
1816200	1817200	from anybody.
1817200	1818640	It is dark Sakura.
1818640	1819640	Hi.
1819640	1821720	All right.
1821720	1825920	Celebrity number two tonight is the king of the show.
1825920	1826920	It's me.
1826920	1827920	No, I'm kidding.
1827920	1828920	Loki is here.
1828920	1829920	Say hello to Loki.
1829920	1830920	I'm here.
1830920	1835200	And celebrity number three is the other king of the show.
1835200	1836200	I don't know.

1838200	1839200	Hi.
1839200	1840200	Hello.

1843200	1844200	Say hello to puppy.
1844200	1845200	Hello.

1846200	1847200	And puppy.
1847200	1848200	Are you here to, are you here to plug anything puppy?
1848200	1851640	Because celebrities on game shows are usually here to plug something.
1851640	1856800	Normally I would plug baskin Robins, but I don't work for them anymore.
1856800	1857800	So I don't give a shit.
1857800	1858800	So go eat some Ben and Jerry's this week.
1858800	1859800	Good idea.
1859800	1860800	There you go.
1860800	1861800	Go get your cakes from cold stone.
1861800	1862800	All right.
1862800	1863800	Moving on.
1863800	1866960	Celebrity number five is rice princess.
1866960	1868360	Hello there.
1868360	1869360	Hello.
1869360	1870360	Hi.
1870360	1872460	And what are you here plugging tonight?
1872460	1873460	My friends.
1873460	1875460	You were about to say.
1875460	1877460	La la la la.
1877460	1880960	She's not like she's going to say her butt.
1880960	1881960	Yes.
1881960	1889400	And as carousel in chat says the drag queen of the show that might've been about somebody
1889400	1890400	else.
1890400	1891400	I don't know.
1891400	1892400	There you have it.
1892400	1893400	All right.
1893400	1894400	And then also joining us.
1894400	1895400	Celebrity number six.
1895400	1896400	Hello.
1896400	1897400	Casper the gay.
1897400	1898400	Yes.
1898400	1899400	How are you?
1899400	1900400	Pretty good.
1900400	1901400	Excellent.
1901400	1902400	And what are you here to plug tonight?
1902400	1903400	I will be playing your button.
1903400	1904400	All right.
1904400	1905400	Remember it's only porn.
1905400	1906400	If you tape it.
1906400	1907400	All right.
1907400	1911120	Now, Footy Monster, do you have anything to plug tonight?
1911120	1912120	I do.
1912120	1913120	What?
1913120	1914120	No, no, no.
1914120	1915120	You don't get to plug unless you win.
1915120	1916120	All right.
1916120	1917120	Okay.
1917120	1918120	There you go.
1918120	1919120	All right.
1919120	1920120	So here we go.
1920120	1921120	All right.
1921120	1922120	So since we all know how it works, here it comes.
1922120	1923120	Question number one.
1923120	1924120	All right.
1924120	1926840	And Footy Monster, when you know your answer, just keep to yourself until the rest of us
1926840	1927840	have come up with our answer.
1927840	1928840	Okay.
1928840	1929840	So here we go.
1929840	1930840	Do I have to exit the chat or anything?
1930840	1931840	No.
1931840	1932840	You don't have to.
1932840	1933840	You can use them for ideas.
1933840	1934840	It's okay.
1934840	1935840	It's not cheating.
1935840	1936840	All right.
1936840	1939840	So question number one.
1939840	1946280	Jamie was very excited to hear that Brewfest was going to be celebrated in World of Warcraft.
1946280	1951480	However, when she remembered that she canceled her account, she was sad.
1951480	1953640	But that's okay, she thought to herself.
1953640	1961840	If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can blank.
1961840	1965440	Jamie was very excited to hear that Brewfest was going to be celebrated in World of Warcraft
1965440	1966920	but she remembered she canceled her account.
1966920	1967920	That's okay.
1967920	1971600	If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can blank.
1971600	1975600	Our celebrities will need to ding when they think of their answer.
1975600	1976600	Ding.
1976600	1977600	Ding.
1977600	1979600	Ding, I guess.
1979600	1980600	Bang.
1980600	1981600	Bang.
1981600	1982600	All right.
1982600	1983600	Puppy?
1983600	1984600	Ding.
1984600	1985600	All right.
1985600	1986600	Puppy's going to...
1986600	1987600	All right.
1987600	1988600	Here we go.
1988600	1989600	All right.
1989600	1994080	And do you have an answer, Footy Monster?
1994080	1996080	I did, I think.
1996080	1998080	Have you thought of one?
1998080	1999080	Yep.
1999080	2002760	We're having very bad connections to Argentina tonight.
2002760	2004080	Have you thought of an answer, Footy Monster?
2004080	2005080	Yeah.
2005080	2006560	Can you hear me, guys?
2006560	2007560	Yes, I can hear you.
2007560	2008560	All right.
2008560	2009560	Here it is.
2009560	2010560	Footy Monster, fill in the blank.
2010560	2012480	If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can...
2012480	2018080	Dance nude with no armor in the middle of Ironforge.
2018080	2021680	Ah, dance nude with no armor in the middle of Ironforge.
2021680	2022680	Very good answer.
2022680	2023680	Very good answer.
2023680	2030240	The tape has said, gain 50 points and breathe through my mouth.
2030240	2031240	I'm sorry.
2031240	2034400	I guess I missed something here.
2034400	2035400	I don't know.
2035400	2037000	DarkSakura, what did you answer this?
2037000	2039000	Let's see if there's a match.
2039000	2041000	Not play World of Warcraft.
2041000	2044080	All right, fair enough.
2044080	2045080	Not a match, though.
2045080	2046080	Can I go next?
2046080	2047080	Sure.
2047080	2048080	Rice Princess.
2048080	2049080	Now, I can celebrate by...
2049080	2052800	Logging on to my Final Fantasy XI account.
2052800	2054040	Not a match, either.
2054040	2055840	Casper the Gay, what did you pick?
2055840	2060480	Go to the strip club, the Full Murloc.
2060480	2062480	You are an idiot.
2062480	2064480	That's terrible, Urha.
2064480	2066680	The Full Murloc.
2066680	2069240	That was the best part.
2069240	2070240	All right.
2070240	2073500	Loki, I know I can celebrate by...
2073500	2075440	Just drinking at home.
2075440	2076440	Just drinking at home.
2076440	2078800	How is that any different from any other night?
2078800	2079800	All right.
2079800	2081440	Good answer, but not a match.
2081440	2083320	You would have a celebratory hat.
2083320	2086720	Party hats, ooh.
2086720	2087720	All right.
2087720	2088720	Puppy.
2088720	2089720	That makes drinking more fun.
2089720	2092840	Puppy, I'm going to celebrate by...
2092840	2094400	Drinking by myself.
2094400	2095640	Drinking by myself.
2095640	2097300	Good answer, but not a match.
2097300	2104920	And lastly, my answer, she's going to participate by cosplaying in nothing but her Liederhosen,
2104920	2105920	which also was not a match.
2105920	2110080	Was that almost like a match with me, dancing dude kind of thing?
2110080	2111080	No.
2111080	2112080	All right.
2112080	2114360	Yours didn't involve Liederhosen.
2114360	2118760	Oh, escapist admits to being a shitty answer, okay?
2118760	2123020	Escapist meant to say, gain 50 pounds and breathe through my mouth, because that would
2123020	2125720	make her a better Warcraft player, get it?
2125720	2126720	To be...
2126720	2127720	Yeah.
2127720	2128720	But, but, but, but, but.
2128720	2129720	What?
2129720	2131720	I have a life.
2131720	2132720	Hey now, wait a minute.
2132720	2133720	I play Ragnarok.
2133720	2134720	I'm level 68.
2134720	2135720	At least you don't role play.
2135720	2136720	That's right.
2136720	2137720	I still would not have been a match.
2137720	2140600	But I did play on a role play server, however, I never partied with anyone.
2140600	2142560	We were wondering what the fuck escapist was smoking.
2142560	2143560	All right.
2143560	2144840	Glad to know everything's okay.
2144840	2145840	All right.
2145840	2147320	Ready for question number two, everybody?
2147320	2149040	All right, here we go.
2149040	2151200	Are you ready for question number two, footy monster?
2151200	2152200	Definitely.
2152200	2153440	All right, bring on the pain.
2153440	2154700	Here we go.
2154700	2156360	Question number two.
2156360	2163760	Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release.
2163760	2164940	It's a game, people.
2164940	2168480	The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie.
2168480	2174020	When Loki came home from work one day wearing the tie, the wife exclaimed, what is that
2174020	2175440	around your neck?
2175440	2181480	It looks like a blank.
2181480	2184760	Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release.
2184760	2188180	The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie when Loki came home from work one
2188180	2189180	day wearing the tie.
2189180	2190540	The wife explained, what is that around your neck?
2190540	2193020	It looks like a blank.
2223020	2225020	You don't need to know about your ding on the show.

2258860	2261840	Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its released

2267260	2269420	What is that around your neck it looks like a?
2270860	2272860	Piece of shit piece of shit

2320480	2322480	What
2323320	2325320	What the fuck
2326520	2330440	That doesn't make any sense what is wrong with you for real
2330440	2332440	I
2333760	2335920	Don't want to ask my boyfriend he
2338960	2340960	Wow okay
2340960	2346080	Loki for the love of God have a decent answer. It looks like a piece of shit piece of shit
2346080	2352600	Oh and footy monster gets a point ding ding ding hooray all right puppy. It looks like a
2353760	2359320	Dildo by Nintendo dildo by Nintendo dildo would have been a good answer all right a good answer
2359320	2364880	But not a match and my answer says it looks like a fucking waste of our hard-earned money
2365680	2371680	There you go all right way to be realistic. Sorry well. That's what she would really say I mean honestly
2372360	2373800	All right
2373800	2375800	So here we go
2375800	2377800	I
2383960	2388720	Right are you ready for question number three are you gonna keep up your lead footy monster?
2390040	2396880	I'm gonna try all right, and it blow escapist out of the water tonight, but escapist you know try to catch up here we go
2399480	2403560	Just blow them out of the way I have to come I have to compliment everybody all right here
2403560	2407160	We go question number three and our last question tonight
2407560	2410640	Which thankfully has nothing to do with titty juice all right question number three?
2411840	2417840	Rob was happy to make amends with Nintendo when he called that poor rep back on Monday
2418080	2423600	They worked out their differences and the Nintendo rep said she would send out the Wii cases right away
2424120	2430540	However Rob was very surprised and shocked when inside the box from Nintendo there wasn't any Wii cases
2430540	2433120	But instead the rep sent him some blank. Oh
2433120	2435920	Do I ever think ding ding?
2436600	2438600	Ding of the century
2438600	2443640	happy to make amends with Nintendo when he called that poor rep back on Monday. They
2443640	2447640	worked out their differences and the Nintendo rep said she would send out the Wii cases
2447640	2451120	right away. However, Rob was surprised when shots went inside the box from Nintendo. There
2451120	2454680	wasn't any Wii cases, but instead the rep sent him some blank.
2454680	2479400	Rob was very surprised and shocked when inside the box from Nintendo there wasn't any Wii
2479400	2491080	cases, but instead the rep sent him some steaming piles of crap and escapist said instead the
2491080	2504020	rep sent him some dried Yoshi crap. What the hell is wrong with our country tonight? And
2504020	2512240	Argentina? Alright, Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. Instead of the Wii cases, the rep
2512240	2519360	sent him some tube of lube. Good answer, not a match. Rice Princess, instead of the cases,
2519360	2532640	the rep sent him some tacked. Not a match. Eddie, the rep sent him some titty juice.
2532640	2536200	Yeah, I know that was coming. It was funny the first time. Oh, and Escapist will like
2536200	2539960	to remind us he's Canadian, so I'm sorry. What's wrong with three different countries
2539960	2547040	tonight apparently? Alright. Loki, Dooty! Dooty! Dooty, that's a match with Footy Monster.
2547040	2553000	Footy Monster gets another point. Good job, Footy Monster. Alright. Puppy, Nintendo rep
2553000	2560400	sent him some ribbed condoms. Ribbed condoms, not a match. Good answer though. And lastly,
2560400	2568560	my answer, the rep sent him a bowel movement. Someone had the nerve to send me a bowel movement
2568560	2574960	and they shall pay for this crime. Watch Pink Flamingo sometime. The couch has rejected
2574960	2580280	me. Alright, so there it is, another match for Footy Monster. Footy Monster. Argentina
2580280	2588640	beats Canada 3-0 tonight. Good job. Goal! That's okay, Escapist. We still love you.
2588640	2593040	We love Canada, but unfortunately you did not win tonight. Enjoy our lovely partying
2593040	2598680	gift. Our lovely partying gift tonight. Some of Rice Princess's love and affection. Love
2598680	2604040	and affection. What did you think I was going to say? Perfect. Alright. Footy Monster, you
2604040	2608640	win. You get to plug something. What did you want to plug? I just wanted to plug the Ultimate
2608640	2615440	Quest, the RPG podcast that's also on ultimatequest.net and ballgames.com. And you can listen to it
2615440	2623160	on Wednesdays at noon pacific or 3pm eastern time. Check it out if you haven't yet. Alright,
2623160	2627080	the Ultimate Quest, the ultimate podcast about roleplaying games. They certainly are more
2627080	2631340	educated on roleplaying games than we could ever be. So check that out on all games on
2631340	2637280	Wednesdays or their site, ultimatequest.net. Awesome. Congratulations Footy Monster. Thanks.
2637280	2644880	You're welcome. No problem. Now we're going to let you go. Bye. Bye Footy Monster. Alright.
2644880	2650160	That was a fun match game tonight even if it was a little bit random. What is it not?
2650160	2654440	I guess so. Alright. Anyways. More Skype calls later in the show but for now back to the
2654440	2659120	news. So, I think a while back we talked a little bit about how they were going to be
2659120	2669120	remaking Elevator Action for the Wii. Okay. Now they have a new game. It's, well, they
2669120	2673680	first off, their first step in remaking the game is changing the name entirely to something
2673680	2681560	really retarded called Spy Game Elevator Mission. And now it's a crappy looking gun game. Hooray!
2681560	2691040	And if they had some screenshots on this ds-x2.com site, oh my god does it look like shit. So,
2691040	2699100	I don't know. I only hope that that's just the DS screenshots although I think it's only
2699100	2705480	for the Wii. You know, those are Wii screenshots. Wow. One of those games I don't recommend
2705480	2710320	buying. I know it's coming out at the end of October for like $29.99. Probably not worth
2710320	2717720	$29.99 but hey, find it used. Rent it if you really want to. It might not be that bad.
2717720	2722100	Then again, it might be that bad. No, it looks really bad. I'll post some screens in the
2722100	2726760	chat. They should have made it a sequel to like Leisure Larry like Elevator Mission.
2726760	2733920	You mean Leisure Suit Larry? Yeah, whatever. Alright. I'm looking in our chat room here.
2733920	2740040	Corizzle's commenting on the match game tonight. Show tunes would have added to the randomness.
2740040	2744720	No show tunes tonight in match game. Go figure. It would have been one of my answers actually.
2744720	2749600	Just the questions just didn't work out that way. Moving on in the news, if you want to
2749600	2756060	go back to Halo 3, everybody's asking is Halo 3 it? I mean, I can't really talk about the
2756060	2761100	plot of Halo 3 but let's certainly say it makes people think that Halo 3 could be the
2761100	2769760	last game in the series. However, into which Eddie's going, oh man, Creamy River, meh.
2769760	2775380	However, community leader Brian Gerard has revealed that Bungie is at work on another
2775380	2780140	Halo game. It is based on the Halo universe and is a collaboration between Bungie and
2780140	2786160	Peter Jackson. Isn't that Halo Wars? No, but that announcement's been out for a while.
2786160	2791300	Yeah, that announcement was out there for a while, but it's not Halo 4. Some other Halo
2791300	2793580	universe project. I thought that announcement was already out there as well. I thought it
2793580	2797620	was supposed to be a movie or a game based on the supposed movie that they were going
2797620	2805740	to do. Yeah, who knows? Who knows? Apparently though, if they do want to make a Pimps at
2805740	2810220	Sea game, they do still have the ability to make that. Of course, the code name for Halo
2810220	2817580	when it was being developed was Pimps at Sea, which actually is a game I would want to play.
2817580	2830180	Who knows? Alright. So, for anyone who wanted the Halo movie, sucks to be you. It's dead.
2830180	2839520	It ain't happening. You've been shafted. Yeah. For the bits that were on TV, they had nothing
2839520	2848700	to do with the supposed movie. In fact, the powers that be are quoted saying, the film
2848700	2854580	is entirely dead. The configuration it was in, whatever happens with that movie, assuming
2854580	2860300	the movie gets made, will be a totally different configuration. It's not so much me as the
2860300	2865940	entire vessel sank. Basically, it was a combination of, and there were two studios involved that
2865940	2871580	weren't getting along in the process of making it, Universal and Fox. So, guess what sucks?
2871580	2878300	Well, if they're not going to make it, I'll buy that Warthog that they made for prop purposes.
2878300	2886340	That'd be kind of fun. You know, I'd rather they cancel the movie than make one that bastardizes
2886340	2889700	the entire series, to be honest. I think we can all agree on that. It's probably for the
2889700	2893260	best that they cancel the movie, as opposed to making one that will completely give the
2893260	2897900	series a bad name. Which, I'm wondering, if the World of Warcraft movie is really based
2897900	2902140	on the Alliance, maybe it should be Mercy Killed 2. I don't know. Because I heard the
2902140	2906980	World of Warcraft movie is based on the Alliance, and who wants to pay $9.50 to see that, honestly?
2906980	2910020	Yeah, the Horde's much better. Rice Princess is going to be in the theater
2910020	2913060	by herself. Much more angst and anger on the Horde.
2913060	2917260	All right. Pooface wanted to correct something I said, saying Pimps at Sea was a fake joke
2917260	2921540	project that Bungie announced. But I thought at one point during the alpha process, people
2921540	2924780	were seeing on Xbox Live playing Pimps at Sea. So, I think it was a little more than
2924780	2930260	just a fake project. Well, it started off, it was basically they were seeing playing
2930260	2936640	Pimps at Sea, which was the codename for Halo. And then for April Fool's Day, they created
2936640	2942540	a poster or box art or teaser for Pimps at Sea, which featured a parrot with a pirate
2942540	2948420	hook head. Which is pretty funny, actually. Now, I would go back to playing Puzzle Pirates
2948420	2951740	if it had that theme going on. I love Puzzle Pirates.
2951740	2955080	Yes, actually, I'm considering going back to it after not having played it for years.
2955080	2958420	You played Puzzle Pirates about as long as I played Final Fantasy XI, huh? You played
2958420	2961300	it a long time. I played it for about at least two years.
2961300	2962420	Wow. Wow.
2962420	2966260	That's hardcore. And it's still going, huh? Yeah, it's still going. They just, like in
2966260	2971940	the last month and a half or so, released a couple of new big features that actually
2971940	2978760	have made the game even more successful. And Three Rings is rolling in dough. And they
2978760	2985180	have the coolest fucking office ever. SSJ 100 Matt says if he could cast the Halo
2985180	2989900	movie, he might cast Horatio Sans as Master Chief. I think that might be a sure recipe
2989900	2990900	for disaster. What?
2990900	2995080	I think that's, no, I think that's more maybe why the movie got cancelled, who knows. Shadow
2995080	2999460	Next Gen says with the success of Halo 3, I find it hard to believe there won't be a
2999460	3003540	Halo movie. There's too much money to be made. Yeah, but they can make even more by just
3003540	3007980	making Halo 4. Yeah, but, you know, it would be nice if they
3007980	3013160	made a movie to fill in all the plot holes between the games.
3013160	3016340	For real. Whatever, minimal. It's more like a plot dashed
3016340	3018620	line. And Cortana can just randomly interrupt the
3018620	3023260	movie going like, eh, save me, Master Chief. No, I mean, because, like, I mean, yeah, playing
3023260	3026220	devil's, I mean, don't, don't people play it for the multimode? I mean, is it really
3026220	3031340	about the, the actual game? I mean, look at all the advertisements that
3031340	3035020	they did. I mean, they went through that whole process of like, oh, humanity's last hope
3035020	3038020	is Master Chief. Believe! No, look, if, if.
3038020	3041380	And it had nothing to do, those commercials had nothing to do with the game.
3041380	3045620	Y'all know that if the Halo movie gets cast, I am bidding for the role of Donut. Okay,
3045620	3050980	that's all I have to say. You have to watch, you have to watch Red vs Blue. Never mind.
3050980	3054020	Oh, wow. Forget it. I would think that more people would do that.
3054020	3058380	I love Donut. I love Donuts, too. Donuts, either way.
3058380	3064540	No, no, okay, just, just go on YouTube and look up Red vs Blue and Donut, D-O-N-U-T.
3064540	3069060	Or just go to Roosterteeth.com and view them all there.
3069060	3073420	It's not pink, it's lightish red! Or you can watch all the episodes on Xbox Live
3073420	3077400	Video Marketplace, or... Escapist says, I think there's a comic series
3077400	3081220	coming out that fills in the hole between Halo 2 and 3.
3081220	3085340	Fuck that, I ain't reading for shit! Why did they make me read?
3085340	3090460	And GS68 is basically saying that I can play Tingle, but only, quote, as long as Loki is
3090460	3095700	a Covenant alien in a Tingle costume. In the Halo movie.
3095700	3099700	The fuck does that have to do with anything? I don't know, but it would be funny. Who would?
3099700	3105180	Yes, they have some fascination with wanting to see me dress up as Tingle. I don't know
3105180	3108020	why. No, we actually made a bet a couple episodes
3108020	3110540	ago. We actually made this bet, and I'm totally
3110540	3113100	going to reiterate this for our listeners' benefit.
3113100	3116700	Loki said there is no way in hell the Eye of Judgment will be a success.
3116700	3121100	So what we made the bet is, if the Eye of Judgment sells one million units in the first
3121100	3126660	six months, then Loki will dress up in a Tingle costume, and skip around the garage while
3126660	3130900	we film him on the Eye of Judgment live in a match with Bobby Blackwolf, and then set
3130900	3135880	the Eye of Judgment on fire. Why has this not happened yet?
3135880	3137940	Because the Eye of Judgment has to sell a million units first.
3137940	3141660	We should still do it anyway. It did, it did.
3141660	3147780	We need to convince Joystick or Kotaku or something to run the story as a lie, just
3147780	3153700	so we can say, look, it happened. Where do you even find a Tingle costume?
3153700	3155420	Get a green leotard and a pair of red for the looms?
3155420	3157960	Rice Princess will have to get out her sewing kit.
3157960	3165460	First off, Rob, just so you know, I do get monthly sales numbers, you know, of each title
3165460	3172180	individually, so we can tell if they've sold a million units or not.
3172180	3173180	Well, shit.
3173180	3175180	We could ruin the fun.
3175180	3176180	Thank you, Debbie Downer.
3176180	3177180	All right.
3177180	3182860	Or, or he can just, you know, change the numbers if it actually does sell over a million.
3182860	3184260	He has, he could say he has proof.
3184260	3187260	Yeah, we'll see. All right, well, okay, moving on.
3187260	3189540	First off, it'll never sell a million.
3189540	3197260	Anyways, so, um, there's a lot of Command & Conquer going around, apparently.
3197260	3203220	Electronic Arts announced this week that they'll release a Command & Conquer Saga, which is
3203220	3207140	a compilation of 13 games in the series.
3207140	3211860	Included in it will be the original Command & Conquer, Command & Conquer the Covert Operations,
3211860	3215860	Command & Conquer Red Alert, Command & Conquer Red Alert Counter-Strike, Command & Conquer
3215860	3221540	Red Alert the Aftermap, Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun, Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun
3221540	3227960	Firestorm, Command & Conquer Red Alert 2, Command & Conquer Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge,
3227960	3232420	Command & Conquer Renegade, Command & Conquer Generals, Command & Conquer Generals Zero
3232420	3236020	Hour and finally, Command & Conquer 3 The Tiberian Games.
3236020	3237960	Where do you have time to play all that?
3237960	3240400	That will be coming out later this month for 50 bucks.
3240400	3241640	Says the manual.
3241640	3244840	...
3244840	3249880	Rice Princess, do not say things unless you're going to say them in a microphone, because that joke is lost forever.
3249880	3254280	Alright, anyhow, really quickly, I wanna mention this MMO,
3254280	3258020	which is something I'm looking forward to, it's a sci-fi based MMO, and it's by
3258020	3259240	Richard Garriott, who
3259240	3263660	of course, was the guy behind Ultima. Hell yeah! Tabula Rasa
3263660	3268300	is coming out! Hell yeah! Tabula Rasa is coming out,
3268300	3275300	But a little later than originally intended. It was going to be out this month, but NCsoft has had to delay the release until November 2nd, but that's not that far back.
3275300	3279300	It was originally going to come out October 19th. It's been delayed a couple weeks.
3279300	3287300	So apparently there was a post on the game's official website. The game is having some stability and balance issues, so it's going to be in beta for just two more weeks.
3287300	3291300	It's a sci-fi based MMO that looks like it could be kind of fun, so I'm going to check it out.
3291300	3294300	And the main character is Tank Girl? What?
3294300	3296300	Dude, Tank Girl is awesome.
3296300	3300300	Kind of. I don't know. Well, you can customize your character. I can show you.
3300300	3308300	I don't know how to describe how the game looks. I was looking at a trailer earlier today, and it looks like, I don't know, like, Fantasy Star Online meets MechWarriors or something. It's kind of crazy.
3308300	3313300	But it looks like fun, so I'm going to check. I want to try a good sci-fi MMO. We'll see.
3313300	3315300	So you said they're working on balance issues?
3315300	3316300	Yes.
3316300	3319300	You mean there's actually MMO companies that care about that?
3319300	3322300	Apparently. I don't know.
3322300	3325300	Lord knows there haven't been enough class changes in WoW.
3325300	3332300	Well, you know, the good thing about MMOs is that they can keep changing it if it ain't broke. Or if it is broke.
3332300	3335300	Well, Blizzard likes to break things a lot anyway.
3335300	3337300	Apparently I'm broken, and I need to be changed.
3337300	3340300	If it's broke, break it more. That's the way you do it.
3340300	3343300	Let's finish up the gaming news so we can get calls and end the show already.
3343300	3349300	Well, Nintendo is giving us a little love. They're offering a Zelda feather stylus.
3349300	3350300	What?
3350300	3352300	A feather?
3352300	3358300	Yeah, it's this transparent feather-shaped plastic thingy.
3358300	3365300	It's like if you are registering your copy of Phantom Hourglass on Nintendo's website, you can get a stylus that looks like a feather pen.
3365300	3368300	But really all it is is a chunk of plastic that looks like a feather.
3368300	3369300	Is it free?
3369300	3370300	Yes, it's free.
3370300	3372300	Oh.
3372300	3374300	I would think they would at least be able to pay for it.
3374300	3376300	Register it like you didn't steal it.
3376300	3378300	I'll register mine and give it to you.
3378300	3382300	And that puts the nail in the coffin on those stories.
3382300	3386300	All right. Well, we're going to be getting to the Skype line very soon.
3386300	3389300	But one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.
3389300	3396300	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeloungeRadio.
3396300	3399300	So we look forward to hearing your calls very soon.
3399300	3401300	But first, one more story.
3401300	3409300	Well, unfortunately, I guess Rockstar is going to be giving out a Manhunt 2 themed Wii.
3409300	3414300	What's disappointing about the whole thing is the whole artwork is a sticker, basically.
3414300	3417300	I mean, come on, that's a little cheap, don't you think?
3417300	3423300	But it looks like the Wii has been, I don't know, through some medical waste or something.
3423300	3426300	It's like covered in fake blood.
3426300	3428300	But once again, it's a fucking sticker.
3428300	3430300	I mean, seriously, pay for it to be airbrushed or something.
3430300	3433300	I mean, come on, that's fucking lazy.
3433300	3439300	Watch that be some sort of GameStop promo item or something that comes with the fucking game.
3439300	3441300	I just like the idea of a bloody looking Wii.
3441300	3445300	It's this weird paradox, because Nintendo's always been so family friendly,
3445300	3449300	so to see the Wii all horrified is pretty cool.
3449300	3452300	Maybe they'll just have a Wii on her period sit on it.
3452300	3454300	That's disgusting.
3454300	3457300	You know, the times I don't want you to have a mic, you somehow get one.
3457300	3459300	Oh my god. Like titties you should forget about.
3459300	3461300	It's like having extra fur on the show again.
3461300	3463300	I know, totally.
3463300	3467300	Alright, Skyblind is open. Give us a call. 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3467300	3468300	The calls are already coming in.
3468300	3470300	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?
3470300	3472300	Hey, it's Ronmo. What's up, everyone?
3472300	3474300	Hello, Ronmo.
3474300	3476300	What's up? How you doing?
3476300	3481300	I'm doing good. I'm recovering from yet another convention I went to this weekend.
3481300	3483300	What convention did you go to this weekend?
3483300	3492300	It's Mong A Neck, a smaller, low-key convention geared towards Japanese comics and panels and cool stuff like that.
3492300	3497300	And really quickly, sum us up for the con. What was the highlights?
3497300	3507300	The 18-plus stuff, like 18-plus yaoi yuri dating game, the 18-plus match game that I ran, and cosplay chess.
3507300	3512300	That's right. You asked us if you could steal the match game from us to play at the con, huh?
3512300	3519300	I remember that. I was like, dude, it's a Mark Goodson production. It's not really our idea, so you'd rip it off just like we would, so there you go.
3519300	3525300	That's okay. We recorded the whole thing, so we're going to try to dump it to DVD so I'll send you guys a copy of it.
3525300	3527300	We'll see how rude and raunchy we got.
3527300	3530300	Alright, sounds good. So what else is going on in your gaming world?
3530300	3540300	Not too much. From listening from last week, I figured I would call in and get a much better review of Digital Life.
3540300	3541300	I'd like to hear it.
3541300	3545300	Alright. I swear to God, if we get into the DDR contest, this is going to be a short call.
3545300	3549300	Well, I wasn't even there for that.
3549300	3552300	Oh, thank God. Alright, so then what was your review of Digital Life?
3552300	3562300	The rating on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd have to give it a 6.5. I'd gone to 3 out of 4 past Digital Life.
3562300	3572300	Last year, it was big in the terms of there's more vendors, there's more companies, more distributors showing off newer products and selling cool stuff.
3572300	3576300	This year, it was like as if they really couldn't get too much of anything.
3576300	3583300	I mean, last year, Game Cap was having a Street Fighter III tournament giving out a lot of cool stuff.
3583300	3588300	You had Guitar Hero 2, Justice League Heroes, a bunch of other cool games.
3588300	3592300	And you had two different sets of pro gaming tournaments going on.
3592300	3599300	This year, the big things were the Namco display, even though it was the same one from last year.
3599300	3602300	They were there. It was just a little bit bigger.
3602300	3607300	Best Buy and Geek Squad were there. Intel showed up.
3607300	3611300	I think it was Global Gaming League out there this year with Dell.
3611300	3618300	They had famous people handing out autographs. They had a gamers lounge with the PMS clan.
3618300	3621300	They had a little kid section for the kids to play games and stuff.
3621300	3626300	Why do you think things got downgraded this year?
3626300	3629300	That, I don't know. It didn't make any sense.
3629300	3635300	Because when I got there, I got there Friday after work for about hours and change.
3635300	3641300	I expected to be packed full of people, full of vendors and exhibits.
3641300	3644300	And I didn't see it, you know?
3644300	3649300	Do you think there's any correlation to the downsizing of E3 causing this?
3649300	3654300	I have no idea because, honestly, what Digital Life is,
3654300	3659300	is more of an expo on the latest digital innovations and technologies
3659300	3663300	and some cool games that are coming out this year.
3663300	3667300	Maybe what I think it was, so many people went last year thinking it was going to be all of this.
3667300	3670300	And they figured, eh, what is it going to be so?
3670300	3674300	But the thing was, almost everybody there got in for free
3674300	3679300	because if you knew the proper code, which almost everybody knew,
3679300	3683300	you said you spent about $6-$7 for entries for four straight days.
3683300	3687300	Alright, so if you could give, just to kind of wrap things up here so we can get to some more calls,
3687300	3692300	if you had any piece of advice to give the Digital Life planners for next year's show,
3692300	3696300	what would you say?
3696300	3699300	Keep the same people you got here, get some newer people,
3699300	3702300	if you really want to expand and watch the game, get more companies in there.
3702300	3705300	More free swag, definitely.
3705300	3709300	Alright, more free swag. Free stuff is always a good thing.
3709300	3712300	Oh, definitely. Last year I made like a bandit.
3712300	3717300	Thanks so much for the call. Any last minute words you want to give our folks here?
3717300	3719300	I love you, Irene.
3719300	3722300	Thank you too, Ranma.
3722300	3724300	Bye, Ranma. Take care.
3724300	3726300	Come back out here and see us. Definitely.
3726300	3727300	I will. I promise.
3727300	3729300	Alright, you better.
3729300	3732300	Alright, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3732300	3735300	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3735300	3736300	Let's go to the phones.
3736300	3739300	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
3739300	3742300	Hola, como estas?
3742300	3744300	It's your ex.
3744300	3746300	Hi, Extifer.
3746300	3747300	What?
3747300	3748300	We were just talking about you.
3748300	3751300	Oh, your ears must have been burning.
3751300	3753300	Oh, really? No, I didn't hear. I haven't been listening.
3753300	3759300	I've been watching freakin' Flavor of Love or whatever.
3759300	3762300	How did you know to call us?
3762300	3766300	Because I got a text from Irene saying you guys were taking calls.
3766300	3768300	Dammit.
3768300	3770300	I'm supposed to say it on the air.
3770300	3777300	Well, is there anything you would like to share that's gaming-oriented with your week?
3777300	3782300	Sure. I love Puzzle Quest and WoW still.
3782300	3784300	Oh, Christopher, guess what?
3784300	3791300	Did Annie tell you that I'm moving my orc from Elder Thallus, my 38, to Ravencrest?
3791300	3792300	Really?
3792300	3793300	Yeah.
3793300	3794300	Oh, my goodness.
3794300	3796300	I'm actually going to play on that server now.
3796300	3798300	That's awesome news.
3798300	3801300	Hey, Christopher. Hey, Christopher. It's Eddie the Gay.
3801300	3804300	How's your iPhone doing?
3804300	3809300	My iPhone is doing absolutely wonderful. Thank you for asking.
3809300	3811300	Yeah, I miss it a lot.
3811300	3813300	You do?
3813300	3815300	Yes, I'm Eddie and I do.
3815300	3817300	Brand new information, Eddie.
3817300	3819300	Like everybody else's.
3819300	3824300	What the hell happened to this show? I mean, it's like our 250th fucking episode, for God's sake.
3824300	3828300	I always derail the show. It's my power.
3828300	3829300	It's your mutant power.
3829300	3831300	Hey, except for say, titty juice.
3831300	3833300	No.
3833300	3836300	Titty juice? What?
3836300	3838300	All right.
3838300	3840300	At least he didn't talk about bleached assholes.
3840300	3846300	Did you hear that Puzzle Quest is supposed to be the next week's release on Xbox Live Arcade?
3846300	3849300	That's nice. I'm still playing on my DS.
3849300	3851300	Will you give Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live a try?
3851300	3855300	No, I'm not. I'm Christopher and I will not.
3855300	3856300	Why not?
3856300	3857300	Because it's stupid.
3857300	3861300	I don't have an Xbox 360, silly.
3861300	3865300	Well, what if you had one? Let's imagine you had one. Would you pay the $15 to download it?
3865300	3866300	No, my hands would fall off.
3866300	3869300	No.
3869300	3871300	What is your problem, Rice Princess?
3871300	3873300	This is X-Topher.
3873300	3876300	Sorry, X-Topher. What's your problem?
3876300	3878300	Xbox 360, that's my problem.
3878300	3881300	Wait, so what were you guys saying about me before I called?
3881300	3886300	That's something about how you derail the show. And look, look what happened.
3886300	3888300	I know. Look at me.
3888300	3896300	I just want to take a moment and let everybody know that you guys need to think about me in the next two hours
3896300	3899300	so they might find out if I get a promotion at work.
3899300	3905300	I know that has nothing to do with video games, but think of me while you're playing your video games.
3905300	3908300	Yes, it does because you're going to level up at work.
3908300	3909300	Grats.
3909300	3915300	I will. I will level up at work. I'll be plus infinity to pwnage, man.
3915300	3917300	Yeah, man.
3917300	3923300	No matter what, win or lose on the job thing, we're still going to go to Disneyland in a couple of weeks to celebrate, right?
3923300	3926300	What does it have to do with video games, Ross?
3926300	3928300	I want to go to Disneyland.
3928300	3930300	This is what it has to do with video games because we're going to Disneyland
3930300	3934300	and we're going to be in LA at the same time E for All is going on, but we're not going to E for All.
3934300	3939300	By the way, a moment of silence from my premium annual pass which expired today.
3939300	3943300	Did you know that you could play WoW at Disneyland for $7 an hour?
3943300	3944300	I just farted.
3944300	3946300	Why would I do that? Why?
3946300	3949300	I didn't say you were going to, but you have the ability to.
3949300	3951300	Really? Where is that? Because that's kind of a novelty thing.
3951300	3953300	Why would you want to know? You wouldn't do that.
3953300	3955300	I'm just curious. I'm going to take pictures of people who do.
3955300	3958300	Look, if I know you think I've ever been to Disneyland, geez. Someone just told me.
3958300	3960300	Look it up, noob.
3960300	3961300	Stop being so poor.
3961300	3962300	No.
3962300	3963300	All right.
3963300	3964300	I want to be poor.
3964300	3966300	All right. Any last words for our listeners, Extrofer?
3966300	3972300	Die? No, I'm kidding. Live, people, live.
3972300	3974300	Rude. All right, live.
3974300	3976300	You look beautiful.
3976300	3977300	Bye.
3977300	3978300	Bye, Christopher.
3978300	3980300	Bye.
3980300	3982300	All right, let's get some more calls.
3982300	3991300	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3991300	3997300	Waiting for some calls. Just waiting for some calls.
3997300	3999300	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
3999300	4000300	It's GS68.
4000300	4003300	Hello, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?
4003300	4007300	I'm still playing Maximum Tune 3. I finally got the soundtrack this week.
4007300	4016300	Damn it. I saw somebody linked me. I don't know if it was you or somebody linked me to where I could obtain the soundtrack for a low, low, low cost.
4016300	4017300	A zero.
4017300	4019300	Oh, no, it was just a very low cost.
4019300	4020300	What was the soundtrack?
4020300	4022300	Midnight Maximum Tune 3.
4022300	4027300	Oh, that just really sucks that you don't have that yet. Do you have that?
4027300	4031300	Well, maybe you could play it for me.
4031300	4032300	Over and over.
4032300	4038300	Yes, on my iPod. Anyway, okay, so tell me a little bit about Maximum Tune 3.
4038300	4039300	I would also like to hear it.
4039300	4040300	The soundtrack?
4040300	4041300	Mm-hmm.
4041300	4053300	Yeah, it's very good so far. Especially the songs. One song that sticks out is Black Pressure.
4053300	4062300	It's not the original Maximum Tune soundtrack. There's a song called Destination Black and it's the Blackbirds theme.
4062300	4064300	Why's it always got to be about the black songs?
4064300	4077300	Yeah, well, this song starts off with some choir chanting and that's what made it stand out from the other songs.
4077300	4079300	But it's still Eurobeat, right?
4079300	4084300	No, still, wait, Eurobeat?
4084300	4089300	No, you're thinking of Initial D, silly. You think of Initial D as the Eurobeat music.
4089300	4091300	Well, it still kind of is.
4091300	4095300	It's more of a Euro rave or something. I don't know how to explain it.
4095300	4101300	But is number three as good of a soundtrack as number two, if not better?
4101300	4106300	Oh, I'm liking it better. It has more, I'm working out all the songs in my car.
4106300	4108300	Is it good driving music?
4108300	4113300	Yeah, it's pretty good, but only when you're driving.
4113300	4116300	Just make sure to obey those speed laws, son.
4116300	4120300	Yeah, the problem is it's not very good music to listen to in traffic jams.
4120300	4123300	It's probably not because then you want to run over the cars like it's burnt out.
4123300	4133300	Or I'm going to stop. I just pause the music and rewind it back because I don't want to be listening to that kind of music when I stop because it wouldn't feel right.
4133300	4138300	All right, well, appreciate the review of the soundtrack. Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
4138300	4145300	Yeah, J.P. Moss's Speedcar is horrible. It's an okay song, but it's the cheesiest song I've ever heard.
4145300	4146300	Which song was this?
4146300	4149300	Speedcar, the one I was singing last week.
4149300	4152300	Oh, okay. Cheesy. All right.
4152300	4155300	All right, well, thank you, GS68, for the phone call. Appreciate it.
4155300	4156300	No problem.
4156300	4158300	Take care, buddy.
4158300	4165300	All right. We'll do one more call. 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4165300	4171300	Give us a call. We'll talk. Our number is 555-4444. No, just kidding.
4171300	4176300	We're waiting for that call. Oh, here we go. Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
4176300	4177300	This is Pooface.
4177300	4180300	Pooface, what's on your mind, buddy?
4180300	4187300	I was just going to say how I'm really looking forward to Half-Life 2, the Orange Box.
4187300	4190300	What is it about the Orange Box that has you so excited?
4190300	4196300	I've just been really... I really got into Half-Life 2, and Portal looks really sweet.
4196300	4204300	Like, I played the project thing, the Narbacular Drop game. That was pretty cool, but it was really short.
4204300	4206300	And Portal looks like it's going to make it a lot better.
4206300	4211300	And, of course, there's Half-Life 2 Episode 2, which continues the story of Half-Life 2.
4211300	4215300	And Team Fortress 2, I've been playing the beta for a couple weeks. That's pretty sweet.
4215300	4223300	All I'm hoping is that later on, as a downloadable piece, that they have Garry's Mod, because that would be so awesome.
4223300	4226300	It's my crap PC at home. Can't run Half-Life 2.
4226300	4232300	Portal looks kind of interesting, but I can't help but think, didn't Prey have something similar, where you have the little portals?
4232300	4233300	No one played Prey.
4233300	4239300	I know. I played Prey. The one first-person shooter I did play was Prey. I beat Prey.
4239300	4247300	I played Prey. Yeah, I beat Prey. That was pretty cool, and that was what got me looking at Portal, because I thought the portals in Prey were pretty cool.
4247300	4250300	I think they just switched the graphics and made it the same game.
4250300	4252300	Yeah.
4252300	4254300	So, wait. Now, I see...
4254300	4255300	It's a great month.
4255300	4256300	Hold on. I have to say this, because I...
4256300	4257300	It's a great month. Hang on. Okay.
4257300	4262300	Uh-huh. Well, I see Casper the Gay over here in studio rolling his eyes at this talk of first-person shooters.
4262300	4268300	So, I need to give you a few seconds to try and sell Portal as what is so great about, what looks so awesome about Portal.
4268300	4275300	Even if you don't like first-person shooters, it's not even necessarily a first-person shooter. It's more of a first-person, like, puzzle game.
4275300	4288300	Like, it's really original, and it just looks like a lot of fun, and especially for the PC version, because people are going to be coming out with mods, like, for multiplayer, probably, and custom maps.
4288300	4296300	No, that's fair, because I liked Metroid for that reason, just because it's not a shooter, really. It's like an adventure, first-person adventure game, so good stuff.
4296300	4297300	That and your total Nintendo fanboy.
4297300	4301300	Yeah, whatever. No, but I don't like first-person shooters on any system, even PC, so...
4301300	4303300	I get Uber motion sick.
4303300	4305300	All right. Anyhow, sorry, Pooface, you had another thought I cut you off from.
4305300	4307300	What's a fight in the days of Hexen?
4307300	4314300	Uh, well, yeah, I've also been looking forward to Guitar Hero 3, obviously.
4314300	4316300	I'm totally looking forward to Guitar Hero 3.
4316300	4317300	Me, too.
4317300	4322300	Because I actually have a guitar. So, it's like, I only have to buy the game, and no fucking peripheral this time.
4322300	4327300	Unlike Rock Band, where I'm going to have to buy the Uber box, where nobody's going to want to come over and play with me.
4327300	4328300	No, they're not.
4328300	4334300	Yeah, I'm actually getting Drum Mania instead of Rock Band.
4334300	4337300	Are you importing the one from Japan?
4337300	4338300	Yeah.
4338300	4339300	That's hardcore.
4339300	4345300	But I don't have the money to get the arcade-style DTX drum set, so I'm just getting the Konami controller.
4345300	4350300	Well, there you go. That'll do, as long as it gets you through the game. That's all that's important.
4350300	4355300	All right, well, it sounds like you have a very busy gaming next couple of months between Orange Box and Drum Mania.
4355300	4359300	You're going to be very busy. Any other last-minute thoughts for our listeners?
4359300	4361300	Uh, no.
4361300	4364300	All right. Well, Puface, thank you very much for the call. Have a wonderful week.
4364300	4365300	All right.
4365300	4366300	Hope to hear from you again.
4366300	4367300	Yeah.
4367300	4368300	All right. Bye-bye.
4368300	4373300	Puface hasn't been listening for a little while. He just returned tonight for our 250th episode, so happy to hear from him.
4373300	4377300	I'd like to remind everybody that I had the Orange Box last year.
4377300	4378300	Hm?
4378300	4381300	Yeah, I had the Orange Box last year. In fact, I still have it.
4381300	4382300	Oh.
4382300	4383300	I don't really use it too much, though.
4383300	4386300	Isn't that what you called something of yours? I don't know. All right.
4386300	4387300	What?
4387300	4388300	Hello?
4388300	4389300	Hi.
4389300	4390300	It's Ravenstaufen.
4390300	4392300	And Mr. Bucket.
4392300	4393300	Hello.
4393300	4399300	We just want to wish you a happy 250th episode from the Tekken Game Podcast.
4399300	4400300	Aww.
4400300	4405300	That's so nice to hear from podcasts who are whooping our ass on Operator 11 rankings.
4405300	4406300	That's great.
4406300	4407300	For sure.
4407300	4411300	I'm glad that you guys are thinking of the little people in your lives, like us.
4411300	4412300	Little people?
4412300	4413300	You're bigger than us.
4413300	4414300	I'm glad to hear that we're not.
4414300	4415300	Yeah, you probably are.
4415300	4416300	It's all good.
4416300	4420300	No, but seriously, you guys are like on the Operator 11 top of the charts. It's pretty rad.
4420300	4421300	Not anymore.
4421300	4424300	We were first, and now we're number 14. We're slightly getting back up there.
4424300	4425300	It's okay. We're like number 16.
4425300	4426300	Yeah, we don't care, though.
4426300	4429300	We're number 69, which is an okay place to be, honestly.
4429300	4430300	It's hilarious.
4430300	4431300	It's a great place to be.
4431300	4432300	It's a great place to be.
4432300	4433300	That's an awesome place.
4433300	4434300	Oh, yeah.
4434300	4435300	Great for 69.
4435300	4436300	That's my producer, Toki. She produces the show.
4436300	4437300	Hello.
4437300	4438300	Wow, there's a lot of you.
4438300	4439300	Hi.
4439300	4440300	Wait, do you all?
4440300	4441300	Yeah.
4441300	4442300	Oh, it's a girl. Hello.
4442300	4443300	She's my co-host.
4443300	4444300	All right.
4444300	4448300	God, what was I going to ask? I don't know.
4448300	4449300	Is she hot?
4449300	4452300	Rice Princess wants to know if she's hot.
4452300	4453300	Why are you...
4453300	4454300	I think so.
4454300	4455300	All right.
4455300	4459300	Yeah, Raven and her, they've been together for like six months now.
4459300	4460300	Is there a little showmance going?
4460300	4461300	I think the bucket's serious.
4461300	4463300	Is there a showmance going on on Tekken Games?
4463300	4465300	No, no, no, no. Not at all.
4465300	4467300	Okay, it's all a publicity stunt.
4467300	4468300	I can hear her in the background going,
4468300	4469300	What are you guys doing?
4469300	4470300	What are you guys doing?
4470300	4471300	I'm not your publicity stunt.
4471300	4475300	Oh, we tried to fake it like you guys had a child or something that was like illegitimate.
4475300	4476300	We never did.
4476300	4477300	All right.
4477300	4479300	Sorry, we did call in for something, Sky.
4479300	4480300	All right, what's up?
4480300	4481300	We want to talk about the Orange Box.
4481300	4483300	Ah, it's all the rage this week.
4483300	4484300	Tell us about...
4484300	4489300	You know, it would make sense that people think the Orange Lounge show is about the Orange Box, so we forgive the confusion.
4489300	4490300	Orange Box radio.
4490300	4492300	Tell us about the Orange Box.
4492300	4493300	Did you see the commercial?
4493300	4496300	You should call our show next week, Orange Box Radio.
4496300	4497300	Just to fuck with people.
4497300	4498300	That's stupid.
4498300	4500300	It is stupid. All right, what do you want to say about Orange Box?
4500300	4501300	Did you see the commercial?
4501300	4503300	The commercial for the Orange Box?
4503300	4504300	Yes, I did.
4504300	4506300	It was during the Sarah Silverman program.
4506300	4507300	I saw the commercial for the Orange Box.
4507300	4509300	Did you hear what they said about Half-Life?
4509300	4511300	Oh, God, you were watching that.
4511300	4512300	No, what did...or what?
4512300	4514300	Like Game of the Year or something?
4514300	4516300	Yeah, greatest game ever.
4516300	4518300	Greater than Zelda, greater than anything.
4518300	4519300	Greatest game ever.
4519300	4527300	I loved it that they said, this is the game of the year in 2002.
4527300	4530300	Well, I mean, like, come on, when they sell movies, like when they do...
4530300	4531300	That is us.
4531300	4538300	When they do, like, DVDs, like, you know, they're going to release Unforgiven Special Edition on HD DVD.
4538300	4543300	This was the best movie of the year in 1994, you know?
4543300	4545300	Yeah, that commercial pisses me off.
4545300	4550300	It's like, greatest game of all time, greater than Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time.
4550300	4551300	You know what, I forgive them.
4551300	4553300	Do they actually say that in the commercial?
4553300	4554300	I forgive them.
4554300	4555300	They should.
4555300	4556300	That's hilarious.
4556300	4557300	Yeah, they actually said, greatest game of all time.
4557300	4558300	That's hilarious.
4558300	4559300	You know why I forgive them?
4559300	4564300	Because when we try to sell our show to other people, like, you know, why they should come on our show and why we're a cool show,
4564300	4569300	we always say, hey, we're the podcast award-winning podcast in 2005.
4569300	4571300	Yeah.
4571300	4575300	All I can do is say, hey, our podcast is award-winning.
4575300	4576300	Exactly.
4576300	4577300	We've won awards.
4577300	4579300	We've got, like, two thumbs up from some guy on podcast.
4579300	4583300	We go like, hey, we're a four-time nominee for Best of Life 365 in 2003.
4583300	4584300	Yeah, look at the iTunes store.
4584300	4586300	We've got some good reviews, man.
4586300	4587300	None of that pew-pew-pew shit.
4587300	4588300	We've got some good reviews.
4588300	4590300	Yeah, it's that creator, Scott.
4590300	4592300	We don't get no mew-mew-mews.
4592300	4594300	We've got some, like, good stuff, people saying we're the greatest.
4594300	4598300	I mean, you should get on here so people can hear you and you've got awards.
4598300	4599300	All right.
4599300	4600300	Well, guys, we've got to let you go.
4600300	4602300	We've got to wrap up the show because, damn, we've been going a long time.
4602300	4603300	It's okay.
4603300	4604300	Thank you for letting us get on.
4604300	4605300	You're welcome.
4605300	4606300	Have a good one, you guys.
4606300	4607300	You, too.
4607300	4608300	Bye.
4608300	4609300	Bye.
4609300	4610300	backwards completely lives.
4610300	4611300	Bye, producer.
4611300	4612300	Have a good one.
4612300	4613300	Bye.
4613300	4614300	Bye.
4614300	4615300	They hung up on us.
4615300	4616300	See you later.
4616300	4617300	All right.
4617300	4618300	That's it.
4618300	4619300	We're going to close up the Skype line.
4619300	4621300	Thank you guys very much for calling in tonight.
4621300	4622300	It was fun.
4622300	4625300	But now we need to wrap up the show because we've been going a long time tonight.
4625300	4626300	First, any last-minute stories?
4626300	4627300	Yes.
4627300	4628300	All right.
4628300	4629300	Okay.
4629300	4631300	Let's get real small here.
4631300	4637020	The Simple Series, one of my favorite things to talk about from D3, is coming to the Wii.
4637020	4639460	I have the first few titles.
4639460	4641740	These are all, of course, coming to Japan.
4641740	4650500	The first one is the Mina de Cart Race.
4650500	4651500	Everybody Cart Race.
4651500	4652500	Yes.
4652500	4653500	Everybody Cart Race.
4653500	4655500	It's slated for October 25th.
4655500	4664620	They also have Mina de Basuri Taikai, or the Everybody's Fishing Conference, also coming
4664620	4668340	out on the 25th.
4668340	4670820	The Party Casino, coming in December.
4670820	4675940	The Shooting Action, coming in December.
4675940	4682460	The Block Kuzushi, or the Block Destructions, coming out February next year.
4682460	4689100	And the YY Combat, which I have no translation for, also coming in February.
4689100	4694460	And I guess the Onichan Bara R is supposed to be coming out to the Wii, and that's that
4694460	4696660	one for those who don't remember.
4696660	4703260	It's the Sexy Zombie Killer Game, which is basically the chick wearing just brown panties
4703260	4707220	and a cowboy hat with a samurai sword killing zombies.
4707220	4708220	What more would you like?
4708220	4709220	I mean, seriously.
4709220	4715980	I don't know, it's not the fishing conference game, I don't know, I'm going to be busy playing
4715980	4716980	that.
4716980	4721460	Anyways, other things in the room middle here on the Wii, and this is probably just going
4721460	4726700	to happen at some point, Nintendo's supposedly working on a game that's going to support
4726700	4730460	the Wii Balance Board that's going to be a snowboarding title, and rumors are that it's
4730460	4735300	going to be the 1080 game coming back, so maybe?
4735300	4740420	I mean, I'm assuming someday there'll be a snowboarding game that'll support that.
4740420	4746380	And then finally, one piece of Wii accessories that will not be coming out to the market
4746380	4750100	will be the Nyko Wii Party Station.
4750100	4753900	If you remember, that's that stupid thing that they had to hold controllers, chips and
4753900	4756260	soda and all sorts of stuff like that.
4756260	4761680	Apparently, originally they were marketing that as $25, but it ended up having to come
4761680	4768420	out for the price of $50, and so no one decided to buy it.
4768420	4773420	Oh, and by the way, I also had LED scoreboards for your Wii tournaments.
4773420	4775740	I mean, seriously.
4775740	4778260	Whatever happened to the Wii-like thing that would hold the beer?
4778260	4780620	Oh, is that the same thing?
4780620	4781620	Oh, okay.
4781620	4782620	Yeah.
4782620	4785900	So, it's not coming out anymore, because apparently it's too expensive to make.
4785900	4786900	What?
4786900	4787900	What?
4787900	4788900	What?
4788900	4789900	What?
4789900	4790900	That is it.
4790900	4791900	Okay.
4791900	4792900	Dark Sakura, you have anything?
4792900	4795340	No, I have nothing.
4795340	4796340	Me neither.
4796340	4797340	All right.
4797340	4798340	Nothing.
4798340	4799340	Nothing to say.
4799340	4803260	Well, that is going to bring our 250th episode to a close, and that deserves applause.
4803260	4804740	Thank God it's over.
4804740	4805940	All right.
4805940	4809620	But first, we have to get everybody's final thought, so we'll start off with Dark Sakura.
4809620	4812020	Your final thought tonight?
4812020	4813780	I like beer.
4813780	4814780	Do you now?
4814780	4815780	Is there any particular type of beer?
4815780	4816780	I like Newcastle.
4816780	4817780	All right.
4817780	4819900	We'll go around in a circle here.
4819900	4821540	Casper the Gay, your final thought tonight?
4821540	4822820	Thanks for being here, by the way.
4822820	4826300	When you play video games, children do learn.
4826300	4827300	What?
4827300	4829300	Nobody got that.
4829300	4830820	All righty.
4830820	4834420	Rice Princess, your final thought?
4834420	4835660	Bye.
4835660	4839180	Loki, your final thought?
4839180	4844260	And just when you thought Sony was done with releasing new secues, there is another rumor
4844260	4846100	coming out of Japan.
4846100	4849340	About a 160 gigabyte ES3 system.
4849340	4850340	Oh, yes.
4850340	4855480	This will come with 160 gigabytes of memory on your hard drive there.
4855480	4862320	It will also feature six USB ports, two HDMI outs, and the three Ethernet ports, much like
4862320	4864980	the original design that they showed.
4864980	4871340	And actually, they have a brand new skew that's been logged in, and it will do your dishes
4871340	4872340	and suck your dick.
4872340	4875420	In related news, Japanese men everywhere are marrying their PlayStations.
4875420	4879620	Why the fuck does it need three fucking Ethernet ports, is what I want to know.
4879620	4883220	Seriously, what the fuck do you need that many Ethernet ports for?
4883220	4886340	I don't get it.
4886340	4888900	Nobody understands that.
4888900	4889900	Wow.
4889900	4890900	All right.
4890900	4891900	Is that it, Loki?
4891900	4892900	That's it.
4892900	4898940	And I'm sure, as with all other Sony rumors, it will probably become true soon enough.
4898940	4900340	All right.
4900340	4901740	Puppy, your final thought?
4901740	4902740	Thank you for being here tonight.
4902740	4903740	My final thought?
4903740	4904740	Yes.
4904740	4905740	Believe.
4905740	4908340	All right.
4908340	4909340	My final thought?
4909340	4911260	Master Chief will save us.
4911260	4916260	My final thought is 250 episodes later, and you know what?
4916260	4919340	George Takei is still awesome.
4919340	4921580	He is still fucking awesome.
4921580	4922580	Oh my.
4922580	4924100	All right.

4943420	4944420	Yeah.
4944420	4946580	For only three low payments of $39.90.
4946580	4947580	No.

4948580	4951340	Three low payments of $14.95.
4951340	4952660	Forget it.
4952660	4953660	Word of mouth.
4953660	4957100	What was it that Mitch Hedberg said?
4957100	4959580	Three easy payments and one difficult payment?
4959580	4960580	Yes.
4960580	4964900	No, I think that was actually, it was the other, no, it was the guy who...
4964900	4965900	That was Mitch Hedberg.
4965900	4966900	Mitch Hedberg.
4966900	4967900	I just listened to this on Friday at work.
4967900	4968900	That was good.
4968900	4969900	Sorry.
4969900	4970900	I thought you said Dane Cook for some reason.
4970900	4974180	No, Dane Cook would have just made obnoxious noises and then talked about his penis.
4974180	4975180	Yeah.
4975180	4976180	No.
4976180	4981220	The thing was I somehow got my list of comedians who died mixed with comedians I wish would
4981220	4982580	die.
4982580	4983580	Just kidding.
4983580	4984580	I don't wish death on anyone.
4984580	4985580	That's really mean.
4985580	4986580	I love Dane Cook.
4986580	4987580	No, I don't.
4987580	4988580	All right.
4988580	4990260	Anyway, can we end the show now please?
4990260	4991260	Thank you.
