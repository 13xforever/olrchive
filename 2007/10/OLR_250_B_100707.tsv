504	5608	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5928	14754	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15474	19117	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19801	21644	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
21664	29158	We are live here on this Sunday evening, October the 7th, 2007, for part B of our 250th weekly episode.
29178	31762	That's 250 weeks in a row, give or take a few.
31782	32644	Let's applaud.
33629	36150	We're testing out our new applause light tonight, everybody.
36230	36690	It's great.
36710	40071	It just means that we've had nothing to do on a Sunday night now for how long?
40091	41291	I know.
41691	43471	I think we've gotten emails about this before.
43511	46572	Like, how do you guys manage to motivate yourselves to do it every week?
46632	48693	And we just kind of go, well, we just do it.
49233	50513	It's our club.
50913	53594	Some people go to knitting clubs.
53694	54934	Some people go to church.
55074	55995	Do or do not.
56015	57035	There is no try.
57075	58135	Some people go to poker.
58255	59876	We do a radio show on the internet.
59896	60976	Some people go to bingo.
60996	61156	Yeah.
61696	64057	Some people go to a bar and get pissed, by the way.
64297	66298	Anyhow, back to the news.
66398	67399	Bungie, Bungie, Bungie, Bungie.
67419	69880	Some people play Halo religiously every Sunday night.
69960	72621	I like the word Bungie, and I like saying it repeatedly.
72681	73482	It's like balls.
74122	76943	Just one of those words that makes you laugh.
77524	77804	Well.
78664	83547	Anyway, Bungie has decided to be independent once again.
84247	85268	You know what this means?
86188	90150	This means we could very well get Bungie games on a system that isn't an Xbox.
91914	93574	They could go back to Mac games.
96035	100776	Halo for the iMac.
100856	101456	And you know what?
101536	102396	It would look better.
103156	104356	It would probably look better.
106457	109277	Because what does graphics better, Mac or PC?
109717	110337	The Mac.
111378	111818	Exactly.
112198	113898	That should be determined, actually.
116058	117639	No, this battle is not happening tonight.
118739	119459	Microsoft
119944	131378	is going to continue keeping up with the Halo franchise and continue to partner with Bungie on games however we could have another Rare on our hands
133501	134842	Killer Instinct 3 by Bungie
157955	163078	But she's still got to turn tricks for me whenever I want, basically, is what it is.
163398	164659	It's like the pimp in his hoe.
164919	165399	Kind of, yeah.
165419	165940	That's what I'm saying.
166280	168181	So the hoe's still got to put out when I need it, right?
168481	168681	Yeah.
169021	169682	So, yeah.
170342	174805	But, I mean, then that makes me think, what in their right mind is Microsoft going to pass on?
174905	176526	Because Bungie makes a lot, a lot of hits.
177046	185191	You know, I think the only way they're going to pass is if Bungie says, hey, we want to make a game starring Mario, or we want to make a game starring...
186124	187205	What's the Sony franchise?
187285	187965	Ratchet and Clank?
188486	189547	Spyro?
189747	190668	We want to make one of these games.
190708	191268	Spyro, yes.
191288	191949	We want to make a Spyro game.
191969	193330	Well, that's not a Sony franchise anymore.
193350	194250	Banjo-Kazooie?
194691	195111	No, anyhow.
195591	196592	No, that was Nintendo.
196612	197193	That was Nintendo.
199415	200155	Crash Bandicoot.
200235	200996	Sweet Tooth.
201656	202417	There you go.
203097	203578	Sweet Tooth.
203978	210523	Dark Knight in chat, chat.orangelauncher.com says, Marathon, Kthanks, and GS191 says, I think it's time to revisit the Marathon series.
210964	214206	Ranma says, and Halo was originally developed for the PC before Microsoft bought them.
215027	215127	Hmm.
216502	220666	Alright, your comments in chat, chat.orangeontrade.com when we tape live every Sunday night.
220926	231635	Anyways, so as we've been talking for the past few weeks now, there's this new SKU that people keep talking about, the Xbox 360 Arcade console.
232556	241744	Well, it's been listed on a few retail sites now, Toys R Us being one of them, another one being Amazon.com, both having it showing as being released on the 23rd.
243243	244123	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
273183	277084	All for the same price as the current core system, which is $279.99 in the U.S.
282245	284765	Yeah, you will not be surprised to see this come out.
287226	291266	Yeah, this story just goes to prove that rumors about Microsoft are always true.
292167	292567	I mean, right?
292587	294827	Because this rumor about the arcade thing has been going around forever.
294867	298368	Forever, and they have screenshots taken from the website.
298388	298588	Yeah.
299168	299348	Yeah.
300438	300938	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
328621	329201	Moving on.
330382	331823	Pardon the man behind the curtain there.
332384	333084	Pay no attention to him.
333604	334345	Going back to Halo 3.
334405	335166	That's right.
335186	337707	Halo 3 is in the news, and we love Halo 3.
338228	340969	What's the hatred for Halo 3 over here, Casper?
341950	343071	I don't hate Halo 3.
343291	346373	It's just a boring, generic space fighter game that I'm just indifferent about.
348114	349015	Says Metroid.
349035	350996	Yeah, but have you played the multiplayer game?
351276	352577	Oh, yeah.
352818	353318	Oh, God.
353338	355860	Are we going to get into the Halo game?
356120	357541	Yeah, that's where 73% of people go.
359031	360092	Well, I just want to say this.
360532	366476	On the Japanese software charts this week, Halo 3 actually managed to top the charts in Japan.
366536	374562	Now, keep in mind, though, that's if you separate two of the Pokemon games, of these Pokemon games, if you separate the two Pokemon games, then Halo 3 was number one.
374842	381167	But this is just kind of a for people who said that Halo would not do well in Japan and the Japanese hate Halo and blah, blah, blah.
381187	388452	I would like to actually say I got, because I really suck at Halo, I got my ass kicked by a Japanese player the other day on Halo and it made me feel
389400	397542	Halo 3 moved 59,000 copies, but it should be said Pokemon's Mysterious Dungeon Toki moved 55,000 copies, but there's another version called Yami which moved 46,000 copies, but they're counted separately.
416435	416855	Gears of War PC
444154	446655	which we all know was an Xbox 360 title.
447236	453059	There are five new single-player parts of the game, new campaigns.
453779	457120	Or, I'm sorry, there are new places to explore in the main campaign.
457721	462183	And there's also an encounter with the, what's it called, Bromak?
463003	465405	That's from the end of Act 1 in the 360 version.
466745	467986	I guess it's this big dinosaur.
469887	470507	I've never played it.
471247	472488	It's a big creature thing.
473118	474679	They had it in the trailers and stuff.
475220	475480	Okay.
476201	480804	Well, they've also, of course, expanded the multiplayer options.
482946	485648	They have a bunch of new maps.
485688	492374	They've improved graphic quality and resolution so that if your machine is beefy enough, it'll make it look sweet.
496537	498939	They don't have, though, the four-player co-op.
500219	503181	Gears of War was really fucking hard, especially if you don't play first person shooters.
524341	525202	A lot.
525462	527464	You probably wouldn't like the multiplayer in it.
527684	529025	And the multiplayer is kind of... I don't know.
529065	530726	I didn't like the multiplayer for Gears of War.
531207	534369	I didn't play it that much either, though, so I can't really judge it too much.
536090	536731	Halo's fun.
536791	542576	Now, if you're going to compare just straight graphics, then Gears of War fucking kicks the crap out of Halo 3.
543396	547199	And also, too, you know, a bit of semantics here.
547660	548981	Gears of War came out last year.
549501	549862	Oh, did it?
549902	551103	I thought it was like... No, in November.
551483	552043	Oh, damn it.
552143	552884	All right, then never mind.
555219	558741	Well, then wait, but they're still out within a year of each other, so the question still works.
558941	559501	So there you go.
559981	561262	Well, how about this?
561442	567845	If you were a completely new player sitting down and you played through Gears of War and you played through Halo, what would be your opinion?
567925	568345	How's that?
569746	572327	My thing is I love co-op mode in both of the games.
572427	576549	I think they both have a stellar co-op mode, and more games should have co-op mode in them because it makes the game fun.
576589	577850	Quit falling asleep over there, Eddie.
579271	583933	But as far as I just didn't like the cover system in Gears of War, so Halo 3 is more the game for me.
584492	585713	I didn't like the cover thing.
585753	586333	Say what you will.
587213	587653	That's that.
588634	593135	Alright, I'm sorry, we're putting the Nintendo fanboy to sleep, so we better move on with some news.
593195	594576	So sorry to inconvenience you.
595796	600598	Maybe we'll just get some completely random news, Loki, to wake Eddie up over there.
601438	606820	Well, something very inconceivable has happened, and they have...
607558	635585	they have decided to make a Princess Bride game which is going to be they're going to be releasing I guess sort of a demo version of it to coincide with the 20th anniversary DVD of it and it will be I guess the True Love and High Adventure the official Princess Bride game only one little problem though is that it is going to be a casual game so at least by the sounds of it so far
636075	636355	Wuv, Twiwuv
666497	667758	I've never heard of them.
670901	671881	We're not going to go there.
674003	679968	No, honestly, I've never heard of Worldwide Biggies, which can be found at www.biggies.com.
682930	683391	I don't know.
683711	688375	I'm not familiar with any of their games, so I can't say if it's going to be good.
689435	690116	Alright, well...
691168	695849	You know, sleep all you want through the Halo and the Gears of War news, Eddie.
695889	697329	But you've got to admit, this is good.
697349	698910	This is Halo being used for a good cause.
698930	701890	This is a group called the Cave Girls who put this together.
702050	704131	No, seriously, it's like a gaming group called the Cave Girls put this together.
704451	707271	It's a tournament called the Fight Like a Girl Halo Tournament.
707611	709492	And it's being held this year on October 20th.
709932	710932	And it's on Xbox Live.
710972	712753	It has a $10 entry fee.
712893	714573	Anybody can sign up and it takes place.
714973	717613	All the proceeds go towards the fight against breast cancer.
717734	719994	So the tournament is being used to raise money.
720302	722083	for breast cancer awareness, which is pretty awesome.
722683	724405	There's two different tournaments they're having.
724445	727567	There's a single elimination and double team, two versus two.
728107	733210	And if you want to check out their forums at cavegirlforums.com, they really go down the list of everything that it is.
733590	736472	And you can actually donate your entry fee there online.
737132	737713	Pretty neat there.
737753	740094	Good, very creative idea for a good cause.
740495	744097	I would hope that maybe Microsoft, this will get on their radar.
744157	745438	Maybe it'll be a blip on their radar.
745478	745858	Maybe they'll
746722	748083	Advertise it on the site or something.
748343	750204	Is it Cave Girls?
750404	757248	No, it's just like a cave, G-I-R-L, like a no riot girl, G-R-R thing going on there or whatever.
757268	759189	So there you have it.
760070	760390	All right.
761511	767054	Well, the resident OLR cave girl is going to open up the mailbag right now.
768155	775179	And you notice how she responded with a very cave girl.
775359	775539	Hey!
776249	777710	Don't make me get out of this club and beat you.
806456	810099	We have an email from Picaruno.
810840	811840	Is that how it's pronounced?
812080	812641	I believe so.
813502	814262	Hi, all.
814762	815403	Hi.
816464	819106	I'm writing in to tell you about something I verified this week.
819406	825210	So you know that Sony opened the PC version of the PlayStation Store in Japan only for now, right?
825750	830614	Well, there's something to slightly dodge you about how they check to see if you're allowed to access it.
831363	843932	When I tried to access the store, I managed to see the front page and usage FAQs, but since I tried to click on a game, I got an English message saying PlayStation Store is not available in the selected country or region.
844233	847055	This is rather odd seeing as, you know, I live in Japan.
848396	853659	So I took a screenshot showing the error message along with an IP geolocation result.
854800	856021	It's on Flickr, but...
858303	863748	Now, you might be thinking that since I was using a Mac, the error message was a badly worded way of saying, Use Windows, fool!
864268	867050	But no, even on Windows, I get the exact same error.
867491	870734	Then Sakurina suggested I try changing my system's language settings to Japanese.
870894	872235	Lo and behold, it now works.
874036	876158	There are several reasons why this is retarded.
876679	880462	First, regional settings on the machine should make no difference to a website.
881282	892027	And also to point out something, when the Sarah Jane Adventures was first coming out and they had all the clips of everything on the BBC's website, they actually had it bought by IP, not by your language.
892967	897949	This is what Sony should have done so that you couldn't see the website outside of the UK.
898449	898750	But anyway...
901716	907657	Second is borderline racist as it implies anyone who doesn't have their computer set to Japanese, i.e.
907717	910018	native Japanese people, shouldn't have access to the site.
910418	914459	Seriously, I'm a registered resident of Japan and I have a legal right to access the store.
914859	918739	It's ridiculous that I'm barred because I have my computer set in a language I'm more comfortable with.
919620	926501	Does this mean that any native Japanese person can access the Japan store from wherever they are in the world just because of their computer's language settings?
926641	927481	How dare you, Sony?
928081	929562	You know what I would love for you to do is...
932145	945640	Change your settings to Japanese, and I don't think that you'd be able to do this given where you live, but I would love to have somebody else anywhere else in the world set their language settings to Japanese and try to order to ship outside of Japan.
947265	952507	I was going to ask, if that's all you have to do, then me living in the U.S., could I just change my language to Japanese and do it?
952707	964251	The only other thing I think of, and this is because I've ordered stuff through Japanese websites, is that they actually, the way that the postal system works there, it has it all set by your postal code.
965271	970213	And it's set by your postal code, what city you live in, and what section of the city you live in.
971661	975842	It's really, really difficult because it's set so completely different than the U.S.
975862	980504	system that you're not going to really be able to... If the fields are preloaded that way, then you're not going to be able to do it.
982545	984425	Well, good luck on your quest, Picoruno.
985466	985966	Seriously.
987787	999411	So, next email up is... You mentioned the orange box in the last episode, and it just occurred to me that I should send you guys my anti-orange box rant from a couple weeks ago.
999431	1000411	Okay.
1000431	1000611	Okay.
1001724	1004149	The Rant, Valve and the Orange Box.
1004329	1005231	Valve, you suck.
1006914	1008657	That shall be the thesis of this rant.
1010748	1011889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1035467	1036467	TF2 and Portal.
1036507	1042308	They added two games I already own and love into the package, cranked the price up to $50 and forced me to buy them.
1042549	1043029	Again.
1043889	1044889	I'm not pleased by this.
1045449	1051930	Now, I wouldn't mind this normally, but this is the one way Valve has announced they're selling Half-Life 2 Episode 2.
1051990	1052591	Why is that?
1053391	1057452	This is the point where some of you might say that they did this with Half-Life 2's release.
1057992	1059872	Now, I know I have a special edition DVD.
1059892	1063973	The difference is Half-Life 2 completely upgraded the graphics system for its packaged older games.
1064403	1067926	Half-Life and Counter-Strike, now known as Counter-Strike Source and Half-Life Source.
1069868	1074913	Now, some of the smart people may be like, wow, a company like Valve couldn't have screwed up the release this much.
1075674	1078416	Oh, they think they didn't, but they have a solution.
1078536	1078917	Gifting!
1080919	1085063	Turns out that if I buy the orange box, I can give away Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episode 1 to people.
1085503	1087585	What happens to them if they want to buy Half-Life 2 Episode 2?
1087765	1089167	Are they going to release it so that you can buy it...
1090205	1094368	Episode 2 alone, or are they going to do it launch day, or are they going to make us wait?
1094728	1100552	At one point, they were going to have the black box, which didn't have Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, but that was axed.
1104034	1104314	Okay.
1105795	1111119	I'll probably break down and dish out the extra cash, because I absolutely adore the series, and let's know what happens next.
1111139	1117383	So if anyone wants a free copy of Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, I'll probably post a follow-up regarding if I break down or not.
1118519	1123180	Either way, Valve has gone out of their way to piss off the core audience in hopes of increasing their gamership.
1123520	1124180	Well done, Valve.
1124220	1124620	Well done.
1125961	1129861	And that is from... There's still tons of people excited about this coming out, though.
1129881	1130581	That's from Super Al.
1132322	1141624	But that is, you know, nobody ever enjoys those type of, like, bait-and-switch things where it's like, you know, hey, you can get it for this low price, but oh, never mind, we don't want to do that anymore because we thought of a way to make more money out of it.
1142084	1143644	That's just capitalism at its finest.
1143944	1144604	Oh, hell yeah.
1145644	1148105	So, the last email, because we didn't get very many.
1148843	1150127	Greetings, OLR Peoples.
1150187	1150608	Greetings.
1151290	1152193	Ow, my neck hurts.
1152413	1153697	This is from Poo Face, by the way.
1155382	1156184	I love that name.
1156244	1157046	Hi, Poo Face.
1160334	1163717	Last week's show you were talking about the Asshole Mario levels on YouTube.
1164057	1170002	Well, there is a download of a file you can use to patch Super Mario World ROM and turn it into the Kaizo Mario World Game, a.k.a.
1170082	1170782	Asshole Mario.
1171203	1172423	I downloaded it and played it.
1172824	1177427	I was trying for nearly an hour on just the first part where you have to jump the bullet bills across the enormous jump.
1177828	1183672	I still haven't gotten it, and I have no clue how many vulgarities I yelled out while trying to attempt this mass torture device.
1184172	1186054	Download it and give it a try if you're feeling brave.
1186772	1187633	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1206653	1208434	But the sad part is... I'm not dumb.
1209474	1210115	Don't say that.
1210195	1210915	You hurt my feelings.
1211035	1212036	We got another email in.
1212076	1214357	However, I'm not going to read it because it was fairly rude.
1214517	1215117	Save it for next week.
1215177	1216118	About one of our listeners, though.
1216718	1217238	Save it for next week.
1217278	1218619	I'm not going to read it at all.
1218719	1219459	Well, real quick, though.
1219479	1228643	I want to say that the sad part about it is I remember playing this game back when it was a part of Mario All-Stars on the Super Nintendo, and I totally beat it.
1229404	1230084	No problem.
1230104	1231165	It took me like a day to beat it.
1231285	1231925	No problem.
1232623	1236548	and now it's like my video game skills have deteriorated with age.
1236568	1238070	Okay, you're getting old, Rob.
1238711	1239652	So which is harder, Rob?
1239672	1241655	Who gives you some aspirin to combat the arthritis?
1241835	1242216	Shut up.
1242757	1246481	Which is harder, that or the first level of Kid Icarus?
1249151	1254059	Actually, seeing as I got to World 2 and Kid Icarus eventually, it's probably that.
1254200	1255742	Terror, danger, horror.
1256423	1260109	I didn't even know there was a second level to Kid Icarus.
1260209	1262994	I only know the first level song and it's like, wait a minute.
1263717	1264638	Did you beat the game?
1264918	1266139	What about you, smartass?
1266159	1267080	Did you ever get to World 2?
1267620	1269402	I never played Kid Icarus.
1269442	1270022	You suck!
1270122	1270983	So no, I didn't.
1271023	1271844	I've beaten Kid Icarus.
1272364	1273185	Me too, when I was 7.
1273805	1274446	I beat Rygar.
1274466	1275707	Or no, I have to have been older than that.
1275747	1276687	Rygar is a great game.
1276727	1278269	Rygar is great, except for the ending.
1278329	1282832	Now, if you beat Rygar, that's hardcore, because you could not save or password that game.
1282852	1283593	I know, that shit was hard.
1283613	1285214	You have to leave the Nintendo One overnight.
1285294	1286335	Oh, we did, too.
1286816	1289578	And you know what else they would buy on at Commando with Hitler's brain blowing up?
1290418	1291698	I never beat that game.
1291778	1293659	That game was so frickin' hard.
1293799	1294979	You know what game was frickin' hard?
1294999	1296319	It was Strider on the NES.
1296379	1297880	It was based off of the Japanese comics.
1297900	1300080	We need to pay tribute to video game endings at some point.
1300180	1300840	Yes, we do.
1301040	1301581	Good ones.
1301721	1309962	Not ones that are like... There actually was a funny YouTube clip, I want to say it showed up on Dig this week, about really bad video game endings.
1310202	1312383	And it just was a bunch of bad video game endings back to back.
1312423	1312983	It was kind of funny.
1313583	1316524	I hate the ones where it's like you can only get the good ending if you play it in hard mode.
1316544	1317644	You know, I'm thinking, ahhh!
1318996	1319216	Wimp.
1319276	1319856	Wimp.
1320057	1326520	Alright, well if you would like DarkSakura to read your emails on air, send your emails to mailbag at orangelawnradio.com.
1326540	1328061	Just keep it clean and don't make them mean.
1328481	1329381	We don't like mean emails.
1329461	1333203	I don't want emails bad-mouthing other listeners, so just drop it.
1333283	1334604	Unless you want to bad-mouth Loki.
1334824	1337506	Yeah, you can... Or Rice Princess.
1337806	1340267	We need some good Rice Princess bashing emails.
1340427	1341187	Hey, no.
1341628	1342888	And Eddie bashing emails.
1343288	1344409	Eddie's fine, but not me.
1345670	1345950	Alright.
1347010	1348111	Let's move on with some gaming news.
1348564	1356969	Anyways, it started out as an April Fool's joke from ThinkGeek, but now, due to popular demand, they have gone ahead and made it.
1357249	1358990	It is the 8-bit tie.
1359170	1364853	It's a tie that looks like it's made out of pixels, and you can buy it for yourself for the low, low price of $19.99.
1364993	1374419	It's available on their online store, and I guess it's a way to get you some extra nerd cred.
1375359	1376700	And it's a clip-on, by the way.
1378695	1381076	8-bit tie.
1381276	1382437	That's kind of nifty.
1383738	1384158	All right.
1386459	1387800	I think it looks kind of cool.
1389441	1392482	I tried.
1392502	1398225	I think it would be funny to wear it to work one day, just randomly, and have people stare at me going, what is wrong with you?
1398245	1399406	Because they don't already do that.
1399846	1401347	Oh, would you guys see it in the studio there?
1401707	1402127	What do you think?
1402427	1403608	Would you wear that out in public?
1403748	1404929	Would you wear that to the bank?
1405789	1407570	Not to the bank, but yeah, I would actually probably wear that.
1408800	1409543	Because you're a nerd.
1411830	1412131	Yep.
1412934	1413235	Alright.
1414324	1419867	Well, something else that is not to be seen in public is new levels from the new Simpsons game.
1419907	1421128	That is, if you're Rockstar.
1421408	1432294	Because Rockstar has their panties in a bunch because they're upset that the Simpsons game dares to make fun of Grand Theft Auto with its own little Grand Theft scratchy game thing going on.
1433074	1439158	Apparently, some of the game's content had to be pulled because Rockstar was not happy with the way the license was being used.
1439398	1443000	Now, to be fair, Rockstar's not the only one, apparently, but Rockstar's the only one that's being...
1443300	1444440	called out by name.
1445480	1449901	So apparently at Leipzig, there was actually a poster at the Games Convention in Germany, right?
1449921	1454882	There was a poster with Grand Theft Scratchy that caught Rockstar's eye, and they asked for it to be removed.
1455363	1458943	Now, on the other hand, Harmonix, they thought Sitar Hero was funny.
1459263	1460744	So that is... That's great.
1461504	1470506	That is being left in the game, apparently, so... So apparently some companies don't... Some people have a sense of humor, some do not.
1471686	1471786	What?
1472213	1473893	I, I, yeah, probably it's with Apu.
1473913	1474374	I have no idea.
1474454	1475894	I know somebody who has an electric sitar.
1475994	1480415	But here's the thing is that I, I, I have this feeling, to Rockstar's credit, credit?
1480755	1487457	To Rockstar's credit, I have this feeling that it's just one suit who has their feathers ruffled over this.
1487497	1491418	There's just one person whose words have been misconstrued to person versus person.
1491438	1493419	Because I bet most people at Rockstar have a sense of humor.
1493739	1495039	And it's sad that one person...
1495492	1501414	probably has made this whole thing get blown out of proportion, but that's what happens when you're an executive and you say something silly.
1501474	1512338	Well, the thing, I think that their thing behind it is that it's kind of, I mean, they're making it so that it's very obvious that it's a parody of Grand Theft Auto.
1512358	1522841	I mean, Grand Theft Scratchy, they're not doing it like, you know, was it the game that was in the actual Simpsons show, which I don't remember, was like Grand Theft Auto or something, you know,
1523729	1526610	I don't remember what they called it, like Death Hunter or something, whatever.
1527090	1531412	But either way, the fact that it's so similar is why they're probably pissed off.
1531452	1538695	I mean, if it was a game that you knew was kind of like Grand Theft Auto but didn't actually sound like Grand Theft Auto, they might not be so mad.
1539175	1541396	Yeah, but is it really going to cut into their profits?
1541556	1542317	No, it's not.
1542337	1543697	They're just whining little pussies.
1543737	1546798	Well, thank you for translating.
1546818	1547479	I appreciate that.
1549059	1549340	Alright.
1551176	1557444	One more story before we get into tonight's episode of Match Game, which we promised for this part of RP.
1557804	1558325	One more story.
1558806	1559326	Hold your applause.
1559346	1560247	We're not into Match Game just yet.
1560267	1560948	We have one more story.
1561869	1562931	We do, don't we?
1565514	1568097	Well, more joy for our European buddies.
1568927	1571529	Call of Duty 4 is going to have a special edition.
1573191	1575392	There was the beta test and all that went on.
1575853	1597590	So what's going to come with the special edition is two and a half hours of SAS footage with the elite soldiers' history and their formation in the Second World War up to modern day conflicts, a making of documentary, a level walkthrough by Infinity Ward, and a hardcover art book with lots of the concept pictures.
1599443	1601765	Anyone playing on the PC has to download their strategy guide.
1602805	1604466	And that will also be available in the United States.
1606268	1606568	Cool!
1607208	1609030	Worldwide loving for Call of Duty fans.
1609050	1610571	But only on the Xbox 360.
1610951	1615834	Alright, since it is episode number 250, we're going to play one of our very favorite games, the match game.
1615854	1619076	But in order to play the match game, we need to get some contestants.
1619457	1624260	So we're going to take, if you would like to play the match game, if you're in our chat room, just type me.
1624280	1624320	Me.
1625123	1625683	Only once.
1625783	1627884	If you type me more than once, you're not going to get picked.
1627924	1633546	But if you type me once, then we're going to let Puppy pick our contestant from chat today because he hasn't really talked a lot tonight's episode.
1633707	1633867	I know.
1633887	1634827	There's not enough microphones.
1635087	1635367	I know.
1635427	1638568	Sadly, our fourth microphone died, so we only have three microphones we're sharing.
1638929	1644731	So Puppy will pick the chat contestant soon, but we also want to get somebody on the telephone.
1645291	1649534	So if you would like to give us a call and be our person on the phone to play, give us a call right now.
1649875	1654598	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio or our telephone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1654618	1656640	1-877-GAME-OLR.
1656660	1660082	We're going to wait for somebody to call.
1660883	1664946	There's a little bit of a delay between when we say something and when people hear it.
1665046	1667087	I'm just now seeing all the me's jumping up on the screen.
1667127	1669049	Yes, meanwhile, okay, so Puppy sees all the me's.
1669189	1672912	So why don't you pick somebody who said me only once that gets to play Match Game tonight.
1673052	1673432	I'm going to...
1674977	1676158	You're going to roll a D20?
1676318	1678360	I did, actually.
1678440	1679160	Oh my lord.
1679841	1680381	Oh my lord.
1680421	1680882	Wait, hold on.
1681002	1681202	Hold on.
1681222	1682143	We're getting a chatter.
1682163	1682403	Hold on.
1683023	1683864	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
1683884	1684224	Who's this?
1687487	1688968	Hello, you're on... Hi, FootyMonster.
1689128	1689889	Hi, FootyMonster.
1689929	1690329	How are you?
1692451	1693412	Is there a bad delay tonight?
1693532	1694593	Oh, it's probably... I'm having fun.
1694613	1695333	How are you guys doing?
1695734	1696074	Good.
1696174	1699937	It's probably the Operator 11 webcam causing us a little bit of a delay tonight, so...
1700393	1703475	I have a feeling we might have to kill Op 11 in order to have a little lag.
1703515	1704215	I'm sorry, Operator 11.
1704295	1706957	We're going to have to say bye-bye to you guys to kill the lag.
1707757	1711459	But we'll see you next week here on Operator 11 with more Orange Lounge Radio.
1711920	1712520	No, that's okay.
1712560	1716642	I'm pretty sure it's the lag is being caused from Operator 11, so we're just going to end the feed there.
1719504	1720564	Why are you staring at that?
1721565	1721805	All right.
1722545	1723766	Hopefully that will help a little better.
1723926	1725027	Can you hear us now, Footy Monster?
1726966	1728247	I can hear you, I don't know if I'll do it.
1754905	1759687	Well, if so, you say something in blank and have to figure out what that's supposed to be, right?
1759907	1763249	Yes, we're going to say something with a blank and you have to figure out what that something is.
1763409	1765490	So I just want to make sure you can hear us okay, right?
1767130	1767691	I can hear you okay.
1767711	1769451	I think this is a bit late, but I can hear you okay.
1769511	1770512	Okay, well, that's all right.
1770932	1774253	Now I see Escapist has left chat, so I hope that's not a bad sign.
1774313	1774533	Let's see.
1774553	1775774	I want to make sure he's still there.
1777235	1778615	Are you going to play?
1779656	1780636	You left chat.
1784249	1785289	That's never happened before.
1785309	1786269	We have a player just leave.
1786329	1787170	Oh shit, I got picked.
1787330	1787710	Bye.
1788570	1789190	I'm bailing.
1789330	1790250	I scared him off.
1790590	1791131	Leaving.
1791551	1791971	See ya.
1795232	1796332	Oh wait, I got a private message back.
1796972	1797972	Whoops, yep, I'll still be there.
1798032	1798392	Okay, good.
1798412	1799032	Alright, what's over here?
1799072	1801653	This is tonight, Footy Monster vs. Escapist.
1801693	1805614	But before we get to it, we need to get some theme music and introduce our celebrities tonight.
1811204	1816726	All right, celebrity number one tonight is the queen of the show who does not put up with shit from anybody.
1816786	1818066	It is DarkSakura.
1819826	1819866	Hi.
1820126	1820427	All right.
1821307	1824868	Celebrity number two tonight is the king of the show.
1825828	1826188	It's me.
1826228	1826628	No, I'm kidding.
1827128	1827869	Loki is here.
1827949	1828649	Say hello to Loki.
1829009	1829529	I'm here.
1830569	1832970	And celebrity number three is...
1834430	1838853	Rob, it's me, hi, hello, how you doing?
1839173	1842095	Also joining us tonight, say hello to Puppy!
1843476	1844276	Hello.
1844516	1847658	Yes, and Puppy, are you here to plug anything, Puppy?
1848859	1851201	Because celebrities on game shows are usually here to plug something.
1852081	1856204	Normally I would plug Baskin Robbins, but I don't work for them anymore, so I don't give a shit.
1856744	1858405	So go eat some Ben & Jerry's this week.
1859145	1859566	Good idea.
1859666	1861167	There you go, go get your cakes from Cold Stone.
1861207	1861507	All right.
1862499	1866782	Moving on, celebrity number five is Rice Princess.
1867582	1868723	Hello there.
1868843	1869704	Hello.
1869864	1870604	Hi.
1870624	1872125	And what are you here plugging tonight?
1872425	1873946	My friends.
1874166	1874887	You were about to say.
1874907	1877508	La, la, la, la, la.
1877528	1879530	I thought you were going to say something else.
1879570	1880950	She sounded like she was going to say her butt.
1881271	1882671	I didn't say butt.
1882752	1884272	I said my friends.
1884372	1887314	Yes, and as Carizzle in chat says, the drag queen of the show.
1887915	1888235	Oh, yeah.
1888535	1889676	That might have been about somebody else.
1889736	1890036	I don't know.
1890441	1891561	There you have it.
1891782	1893922	And then also joining us, celebrity number six.
1894242	1895123	Hello.
1895243	1896063	Casper the Gay.
1896123	1896583	Yes.
1896723	1897123	How are you?
1897384	1897864	Pretty good.
1898184	1898544	Excellent.
1898644	1899744	And what are you here to plug tonight?
1899964	1901085	I will be plugging your butt.
1903346	1903646	All right.
1904066	1905847	Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.
1906247	1907107	All right.
1907547	1909408	Footy Monster, do you have anything to plug tonight?
1911489	1911829	I do.
1912369	1912589	What?
1912629	1913089	No, no, no.
1913109	1914010	You don't get to plug unless you win.
1915635	1916035	Okay, there you go.
1916075	1917256	Do I have to exit the chat or anything?
1917276	1917756	No, you don't have to.
1917776	1918337	You can use them for ideas.
1918357	1918697	It's okay.
1918777	1919157	It's not cheating.
1919177	1920338	But remember, escapists can see their answers too.
1920358	1920898	Here it is.
1920999	1922980	Question number one.
1939719	1945663	Jamie was very excited to hear that Brewfest was going to be celebrated in World of Warcraft.
1946544	1950687	However, when she remembered that she cancelled her account, she was sad.
1951388	1953149	But that's okay, she thought to herself.
1953589	1957052	If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can blank.
1961775	1966717	Jamie was very excited to hear that Brewfest was going to be celebrated in World of Warcraft, but she remembered she canceled her account.
1966757	1967377	That's okay.
1967798	1970459	If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can blank.
1971599	1974080	Our celebrities will need to ding when they think of their answer.
1975641	1976061	Ding.
1976741	1977161	Ding.
1980803	1981803	Ding, I guess.
1982924	1983544	Bang.
1983784	1984204	Bang.
1984665	1985265	All right, Puppy?
1985925	1986145	Ding.
1986205	1987446	All right, Puppy's going to... All right, here we go.
1988346	1988626	All right.
1989387	1990227	And do you have...
1991038	1993640	Do you have an answer, FootyMonster?
1995982	1996603	Have you thought of one?
1998104	2002448	We're having very bad connections to Argentina tonight.
2002668	2003929	Have you thought of an answer, FootyMonster?
2006612	2007272	Yes, I can hear you.
2007312	2007753	Alright, here it is.
2008473	2009694	FootyMonster, fill in the blank.
2009774	2012397	If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can...
2015169	2036918	Dance nude with no armor in the middle of Ironforge Dance nude with no armor in the middle of Ironforge Very good answer And Escapist said Gain 50 points and breathe through my mouth I'm sorry I guess I missed something I don't know DarkSakura, what did you answer this?
2036938	2040119	Let's see if there's a match Not play World of Warcraft
2042938	2043719	Alright, fair enough.
2044019	2044720	Not a match, though.
2044740	2045400	Can I go next?
2045660	2046541	Sure, Rice Princess.
2047021	2051445	Now, I can celebrate by... Logging on to my Final Fantasy XI account.
2052706	2053447	Not a match, either.
2054027	2055388	Casper the Gay, what did you pick?
2055809	2057610	Go to the strip club, The Full Murloc.
2060432	2061513	You are an idiot!
2062334	2063535	That's terrible, Ross!
2063575	2068079	The Full Murloc!
2068119	2068979	That was the best part.
2069019	2069280	Alright.
2070440	2070921	Loki...
2071596	2074339	I know, I can celebrate by... Just drinking at home.
2076621	2078663	How is that any different from any other night?
2079584	2080444	Good answer, but not a hat.
2080464	2082747	Because you would have a celebratory hat.
2084849	2086290	Party hats, ooh!
2086310	2088692	That makes drinking more fun.
2089653	2091455	Puppy, I'm going to celebrate by...
2092586	2093707	Drinking by myself.
2094027	2095427	Drinking by myself.
2095567	2096708	Good answer, but not a match.
2097248	2105952	And lastly, my answer, she's going to participate by cosplaying in nothing but her lederhosen, which also was not a match.
2105972	2107472	Isn't that almost like a match with me?
2107813	2108993	Dancing dude kind of thing?
2110074	2110454	Uh, no.
2110594	2110694	No.
2110994	2111314	All right.
2111534	2113035	Yours didn't involve lederhosen.
2114798	2118220	Oh, Escapist admits to being a shitty answer, okay?
2118320	2124804	Escapist meant to say, gain 50 pounds and breathe through my mouth, because that would make her a better Warcraft player, get it?
2125664	2130167	To be... Yeah, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, I have a life.
2131708	2132388	Hey now, wait a minute.
2132408	2132928	I play Ragnarok.
2132968	2133268	I'm level 68.
2134620	2150785	at least you don't roleplay that's right, still would not have been a match but I did play on a roleplay server, however I never partied with anyone we were wondering what the fuck Escapist was smoking glad to know everything's okay ready for question number two, everybody are you ready for question number two, FoodieMonster?
2151945	2161068	definitely bring on the pain, here we go question number two Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release
2163686	2164446	It's a game, people.
2164927	2167748	The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie.
2168408	2174891	When Loki came home from work one day wearing the tie, the wife exclaimed, What is that around your neck?
2175411	2176772	It looks like a blank.
2181394	2184375	Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release.
2184755	2186856	The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie.
2186896	2190497	When Loki came home from work one day wearing the tie, the wife exclaimed, What is that around your neck?
2190558	2191438	It looks like a blank.
2197930	2199470	NilssonSky, everybody think in here.
2199530	2200891	Oh, puppies think in here.
2200971	2211094	Oh, okay.
2211134	2212014	Footie Monster said ding.
2214315	2215136	Ding.
2215516	2216476	Dingly ding.
2218917	2219397	I have a ding.
2220783	2221583	You sure do.
2221623	2224985	We don't need to know about your ding on the show.
2225345	2225625	Shut up.
2225905	2226525	Rice Princess.
2227826	2228766	Did you ding?
2228926	2229467	Do you have a ding?
2230007	2231988	Yes, I do, but do you have a ding?
2232648	2233368	All right, here we go.
2233388	2235709	All right, here we go.
2235849	2237990	Oh, wait, I'm actually waiting on Escapist still.
2238070	2240071	Escapist does not send me a private message with his answer.
2240111	2244153	We'll just let the music play while we wait for that answer.
2246334	2249175	Folks in chat are trying to help, giving answers there.
2252392	2252752	All right.
2253373	2254233	Sorry, I just saw the answer.
2254293	2254833	All right, here we go.
2254873	2255994	Finally, Escapist gives an answer.
2256294	2257515	All right, FootyMonster, you ready?
2257615	2257995	Here we go.
2259116	2261977	Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release.
2262918	2264739	The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie.
2264759	2268661	When Loki came home from work one day wearing the tie, the wife exclaimed, What is that around your neck?
2268721	2271962	It looks like a... Piece of shit.
2272243	2275865	Piece of shit, says FootyMonster.
2276205	2277305	Keeps it very simple.
2277425	2278066	Piece of shit.
2278126	2278466	All right.
2279763	2281704	Let's go around and see what the folks in the studio got.
2281924	2282524	DarkSakura.
2282845	2283245	Oh, I'm sorry.
2283265	2283465	Whoops.
2283505	2284646	I have to say Escapist's answer.
2284706	2285186	I'm so sorry.
2285206	2285567	Yes, say it.
2285827	2289329	Escapist said it looks like a ding-a-ling ding-dong.
2291551	2292752	That's going to be a tough one to match.
2292792	2293272	Let's see, though.
2293292	2294673	You never know with this group.
2294733	2295473	All right.
2295534	2297155	DarkSakura, did you put ding-a-ling and ding-dong?
2297715	2298536	Something close.
2298676	2301518	I said big, blue, stripy, pixelated-looking dildo.
2302078	2304700	Big, blue, stripy, pixelated-looking dildo.
2304740	2305200	Good answer.
2305240	2305681	Not a match.
2306181	2307542	Rice Princess, did you ever think of an answer?
2308587	2309567	Yeah, I said clubbed foot.
2309988	2310928	Clubbed foot.
2311949	2313809	Good answer, I think, but not a match.
2313849	2314730	Casper the Gay.
2315350	2318552	It looks like a... Stripe of Rice Princess's titty juice.
2318872	2320853	What?
2320873	2321313	Wow.
2323714	2324875	What the fuck?
2326936	2327976	That doesn't make any sense.
2328436	2329837	What is wrong with you?
2329957	2330737	For real?
2334099	2335660	I don't want to ask my boyfriend.
2339338	2340138	Wow, okay.
2341098	2343459	Loki, for the love of God, I have a decent answer here.
2343479	2344139	It looks like a?
2344379	2344979	Piece of shit.
2345279	2346280	Piece of shit!
2346960	2348820	Oh, and Footy Monster gets a point.
2348860	2349640	Ding, ding, ding.
2349700	2350160	Hooray.
2350240	2350460	All right.
2350821	2352701	Puppy, it looks like a?
2353901	2355061	Dildo by Nintendo.
2355402	2356782	Dildo by Nintendo.
2356802	2357922	Dildo would have been a good answer.
2357942	2358662	All right.
2358902	2359802	Good answer, but not a match.
2360243	2365004	And my answer says it looks like a fucking waste of our hard-earned money.
2366084	2366544	There you go.
2367372	2368653	Way to be realistic.
2368893	2369233	Sorry.
2369713	2371034	Well, that's what she would really say.
2371134	2371815	I mean, honestly.
2372835	2373115	All right.
2374256	2375177	So here we go.
2380140	2381280	You are so stupid.
2384202	2384562	All right.
2385403	2387024	Are you ready for question number three?
2387044	2388785	Are you going to keep up your lead, footy monster?
2390546	2390966	I'm going to try.
2391226	2391507	All right.
2391607	2393768	And blow Escapist out of the water tonight.
2393828	2395909	But Escapist, you know, try to catch up.
2396550	2396890	Here we go.
2401965	2403246	I have to compliment everybody.
2403286	2403906	All right, here we go.
2404066	2404847	Question number three.
2406067	2409589	And our last question tonight, which thankfully has nothing to do with titty juice.
2409649	2411710	All right, question number three.
2412191	2417874	Rob was happy to make amends with Nintendo when he called that poor rep back on Monday.
2418494	2423637	They worked out their differences, and the Nintendo rep said she would send out the Wii cases right away.
2424326	2432903	However, Rob was very surprised and shocked when inside the box from Nintendo, there wasn't any Wii cases, but instead the reps sent him some blanks.
2438266	2438426	Ding.
2438466	2438566	Ding.
2438586	2438686	Ding.
2438706	2439247	Ding of the century.
2464750	2466311	Steaming piles of crap?
2466331	2466971	Dried Yoshi crap.
2499907	2502968	What the hell is wrong with our country tonight?
2503348	2503708	All right.
2503888	2504709	And Argentina.
2505509	2505849	All right.
2506789	2509650	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
2510090	2514251	Instead of the Wii cases, the rep sent him some... Tube of Lube.
2514571	2515652	Tube of Lube.
2516252	2516672	Good answer.
2516732	2517112	Not a match.
2517172	2517892	Rice Princess.
2518453	2521694	Instead of the cases, the rep sent him some... Tact.
2522374	2522894	Tact.
2524614	2525295	Not a match.
2526215	2527155	All right.
2527355	2529336	Eddie, the rep sent him some...
2531055	2531475	Titty Juice.
2532577	2533598	How did I know that was coming?
2533918	2534839	It was funny the first time.
2535380	2537322	Oh, and Escapist will like to remind us he's Canadian.
2537622	2538162	So, I'm sorry.
2538603	2540625	What's wrong with three different countries tonight, apparently?
2540645	2540905	All right.
2541886	2542267	Loki.
2542727	2543248	Doody!
2543648	2544449	Doody!
2544970	2546912	Doody, that's a match with Footy Monster.
2547012	2548233	Footy Monster gets another point.
2548293	2549014	Good job, Footy Monster.
2549334	2549634	All right.
2551276	2551637	Puppy.
2552277	2553759	Nintendo rep sent him some.
2554824	2555605	Ribbed condoms.
2555945	2557507	Ribbed condoms.
2557667	2558168	Not a match.
2558228	2558829	Good answer, though.
2559810	2564415	And lastly, my answer, the rep sent him a bowel movement.
2564795	2570842	Someone had the nerve to send me a bowel movement, and they shall pay for this crime.
2571362	2572624	Watch Pink Flamingo sometime.
2573644	2575046	The couch has rejected me.
2575446	2575806	All right.
2575886	2576587	So there it is.
2576687	2578229	Another match for Footy Monster.
2578629	2579450	Footy Monster.
2579690	2582573	Argentina beats Canada 3-0 tonight.
2582613	2583314	Good job.
2583354	2584996	Cool!
2585496	2587018	That's okay, Escapist.
2587438	2588319	We still love you.
2588599	2589480	We love Canada.
2589861	2591442	But unfortunately, you did not win tonight.
2591723	2593384	Enjoy our lovely partying gift.
2593845	2595006	Our lovely partying gift tonight.
2595286	2596648	Some of Rice Princess's...
2597421	2598241	Love and affection.
2598522	2599122	Love and affection.
2599142	2600623	What did you think I was going to say, perverts?
2600963	2601243	All right.
2602603	2604084	Foodie Monster, you win.
2604124	2605265	You get to plug something.
2605285	2605945	What did you want to plug?
2607426	2614089	I just wanted to plug the Ultimate Quest, the RPG podcast that's also on ultimatequest.net and allgames.com.
2614649	2618911	And you can listen to it on Wednesdays at noon Pacific or 3 p.m.
2619031	2619711	Eastern time.
2620031	2621692	And, yeah, check it out if you haven't yet.
2622785	2626226	All right, the Ultimate Quest, the ultimate podcast about role-playing games.
2626326	2628866	They certainly are more educated on role-playing games than we could ever be.
2628987	2633208	So check that out on all games on Wednesdays or their site, ultimatequest.net.
2633328	2633688	Awesome.
2634208	2635288	Congratulations, Footy Monster.
2635308	2635588	Thanks.
2637168	2637589	You're welcome.
2637609	2638269	Thanks for having me on.
2638489	2638929	No problem.
2638989	2639689	Now we're going to let you go.
2641009	2641249	All right.
2641770	2642150	Bye.
2642190	2642930	Bye, Footy Monster.
2643730	2644270	All right.
2644770	2647431	That was a fun match game tonight, even if it was a little bit random.
2650134	2651555	Spy Game Elevator Mission
2678681	2681022	And now it's a crappy looking gun game.
2681242	2682203	Hooray!
2682863	2687205	And they had some screenshots on this ds-x2.com site.
2687765	2690146	Oh my god, does it look like shit.
2691006	2694648	So, uh, I don't know.
2695428	2699550	I only hope that that's just the DS screenshots, although I think it's only for the Wii.
2699870	2701831	You know, those are Wii screenshots, so.
2704192	2705853	One of those games I don't recommend buying.
2705893	2709314	I know it's coming out at the end of October for like $29.99.
2709774	2714496	Probably not worth $29.99, but hey, find it used.
2714756	2715917	Rent it if you really want to.
2716737	2717657	It might not be that bad.
2718778	2719598	Then again, it might be that bad.
2719618	2720699	No, it looks really bad.
2720739	2722799	I'll post some screens in the chat.
2723560	2726861	They should have made it a sequel to Leisure Larry, like Elevator Mission.
2727401	2729202	You mean Leisure Suit Larry?
2729222	2729582	Yeah, whatever.
2731443	2731743	All right.
2732651	2734052	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2763286	2776169	However, community leader Brian Gerrard has revealed that Bungie is at work on another Halo game.
2776689	2780830	It is based on the Halo universe and is a collaboration between Bungie and Peter Jackson.
2781130	2782010	Isn't that Halo Wars?
2782731	2785931	No, but that announcement's been out for a while now.
2785951	2788112	Yeah, that announcement was out there for a while, but it's not Halo 4.
2789753	2792295	and some other Halo Universe projects.
2792335	2793636	I thought that announcement was already out there.
2793656	2797978	I thought it was supposed to be like a movie or a game based on the supposed movie that they were going to do.
2798399	2799199	Yeah, I don't know.
2799219	2799559	Who knows?
2799679	2800060	Who knows?
2800320	2801541	And, yeah.
2802381	2808565	And apparently, though, if they do want to make a Pimps at Sea game, though, they do still have the ability to make that.
2808585	2816309	Of course, the codename for Halo when it was being developed was Pimps at Sea, which actually is a game I would want to play.
2817570	2817850	Who knows?
2818571	2818811	All right.
2822351	2828373	So, for anyone who wanted the Halo movie, sucks to be you.
2829113	2829853	It's dead.
2830113	2831094	It ain't happening.
2831814	2833094	You've been shafted.
2834635	2835155	Yeah.
2836295	2841537	For the bits that were on TV, they had nothing to do with the supposed movie.
2842497	2847519	And, in fact, the powers that be are quoted saying,
2848052	2850332	The film is entirely dead.
2851193	2857034	And the configuration it was in, whatever happens with that movie, assuming the movie gets made, will be a totally different configuration.
2857534	2861674	It's not so much me as the entire vessel sank.
2862114	2869076	Basically, it was a combination of, and there were two studios involved that weren't getting along in the process of making it, Universal and Fox.
2870356	2871896	So guess what sucks?
2872676	2876117	Well, if they're not going to make it, I'll buy that Warthog that they made for the...
2883400	2887802	I'd rather they cancel the movie than make one that bastardizes the entire series, to be honest.
2887842	2889042	I think we can all agree on that.
2889102	2894224	It's probably for the best that they cancel the movie as opposed to making one that will completely give the series a bad name.
2894544	2900007	Which I'm wondering, if the World of Warcraft movie is really based on the Alliance, maybe it should be Mercy Killed 2.
2900347	2900647	I don't know.
2901815	2911141	Pimps at Sea was a fake joke project that Bungie announced, but I thought at one point during the alpha process people were seeing on Xbox Live playing Pimps at Sea, so I think it was a little more than just a fake project.
2911161	2911241	So...
2927272	2946236	Well, it started off, it was basically, they were seeing, playing Pimps at Sea, which was, you know, the codename for Halo, and then for April Fool's Day, they created a poster or box art or teaser for Pimps at Sea, which featured a parrot with a pirate hook head, which is pretty funny, actually.
2946536	2949857	Now, I would go back to playing Puzzle Pirates if it had that theme going on.
2951758	2955201	Yes, actually I'm considering going back to it after not having played it for years.
2955221	2958323	You played Puzzle Pirates about as long as I played Final Fantasy XI, huh?
2958863	2960925	I played it for about at least two years.
2961085	2961505	Wow.
2962286	2963066	That's hardcore.
2963226	2964047	And it's still going, huh?
2964067	2964747	Yeah, it's still going.
2964787	2974254	They just, like in the last month and a half or so, released a couple of new big features that actually have made the game even more successful.
2975375	2977837	And Three Rings is rolling in dough.
2978637	2980519	And they have the coolest fucking office ever.
2982751	3011689	SSJ100 Matt says if he could cast the Halo movie he might cast Horatio Sanz as Master Chief I think that might be a sure recipe for disaster I think that's no I think that's more maybe why the movie got cancelled who knows ShadowNextGen says with the success of Halo 3 I find it hard to believe there won't be a Halo movie there's too much money to be made yeah but they can make even more by just making Halo 4 yeah but you know it would be nice if they made a movie to fill in all the plot holes between the games yeah
3013677	3016660	It's more like a plot dashed line.
3016680	3023765	And Cortana can just randomly interrupt the movie going like, Save me, Master Chief.
3023846	3025727	Don't people play it for the multi-mode?
3025747	3027689	Is it really about the actual game?
3029650	3032032	I mean, look at all the advertisements that they did.
3032432	3035835	They went through that whole process of like, Oh, humanity's last hope is Master Chief.
3035935	3036616	Believe!
3036636	3039598	And those commercials had nothing to do with the game.
3041460	3045121	Y'all know that if the Halo movie gets cast, I am bidding for the role of Donut.
3045261	3046282	Okay, that's all I have to say.
3049142	3050243	You have to watch Red vs. Blue.
3050263	3050663	Never mind.
3051403	3052123	Forget it.
3052203	3054964	I love Donut.
3056045	3058025	I love Donuts, too.
3059146	3062367	Just go on YouTube and look up Red vs. Blue and Donut.
3064527	3066548	Or just go to RoosterTeeth.com
3067950	3069030	and view them all there.
3069050	3070931	It's not pink, it's lightish red.
3071311	3079472	Or you can watch all the episodes on Xbox Live Video Marketplace or... Escapist says, I think there's a comic series coming out that fills in the hole between Halo 2 and 3.
3081053	3082833	Fuck that, I ain't reading for shit.
3083573	3084693	Why did they make me read?
3085274	3092275	And GS68 is basically saying that I can play Tingle but only, quote, as long as Loki is a Covenant alien in a Tingle costume.
3093635	3094576	Tingle from Zelda.
3104489	3106010	And then set the Eye of Judgment on fire.
3133948	3135169	Why has this not happened yet?
3135649	3138011	Because the Eye of Judgment has to sell a million units first.
3138051	3138891	Ah, we should still do it anyway.
3139252	3142494	It did, it did.
3142574	3149078	I know, we need to convince Joystick or Kotaku or something to run the story as a lie, just so we can say, look, it happened.
3149538	3152700	Where do you even find a Tingle costume, I mean?
3153161	3155362	Like, get a green leotard and a pair of red Tingle loose?
3155382	3157043	Rice Princess will have to get out her sewing kit.
3157724	3159105	First off, Rob...
3159736	3166000	Just so you know, I do get monthly sales numbers, you know, of each title individually.
3166480	3169922	So we can tell if they've sold a million units or not.
3172064	3172684	Well, shit.
3175025	3175866	Thank you, Debbie Downer.
3177867	3181550	Or he can just, you know, change the numbers if it actually does sell over a million.
3183130	3183851	He can say he has proof.
3184551	3185092	Yeah, we'll see.
3185652	3187233	All right, well, okay, moving on.
3187253	3188794	First off, it'll never sell a million units.
3189452	3195917	Anyways, so there's a lot of Command & Conquer going around apparently.
3196817	3205744	Electronic Arts announced this week that they'll release a Command & Conquer Saga, which is a compilation of 13 games in the series.
3206744	3217272	Included in it will be the original Command & Conquer, Command & Conquer The Covert Operations, Command & Conquer Red Alert, Command & Conquer Red Alert Counter-Strike, Command & Conquer Red Alert The Aftermath,
3217657	3235612	Command & Conquer Tyberian Sun, Command & Conquer Tyberian Sun Firestorm, Command & Conquer Red Alert 2, Command & Conquer Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge, Command & Conquer Renegade, Command & Conquer Generals, Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour, and finally Command & Conquer 3, The Tyberian Wars.
3235712	3237114	I mean, where do you have time to play all that?
3237654	3239596	And that will be coming out later this month for $50.
3239636	3239876	Well, for...
3246101	3249766	Rice Princess, do not say things unless you're going to say them in a microphone because that joke is lost forever.
3250347	3250567	All right.
3250607	3250827	Boo.
3251268	3255754	Anyhow, really quickly, I want to mention this MMO, which is something I'm looking forward to.
3255794	3260941	It's a sci-fi-based MMO, and it's by Richard Garriott, who, of course, was the guy behind Ultima.
3260961	3261081	Ultima.
3261659	3266004	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3280119	3283200	So apparently there was a post on the game's official website.
3283741	3287663	The game is having some stability and balance issues, so it's going to be in beta for just two more weeks.
3287943	3291645	It's a sci-fi based MMO that looks like it could be kind of fun, so I'm going to check it out.
3292246	3293747	And the main character is Tank Girl?
3293847	3294047	What?
3295027	3296208	Dude, Tank Girl is awesome.
3296248	3296868	Kinda.
3297048	3297369	I don't know.
3297709	3299010	Well, you can customize your character.
3299070	3299550	I can show you.
3300683	3302243	I don't know how to describe how the game looks.
3302283	3307225	I was looking at a trailer earlier today, and it looks like, I don't know, like Phantasy Star Online meets Mech Warriors or something.
3307285	3308085	It's kind of crazy.
3308445	3309185	But it looks like fun.
3309745	3310486	So I'm going to check.
3310526	3312826	I want to try a good sci-fi MMO.
3312886	3313306	We'll see.
3313787	3315627	So you said they're working on balance issues?
3315947	3316167	Yes.
3316287	3319188	You mean there's actually MMO companies that care about that?
3320128	3320688	Apparently.
3320808	3321189	I don't know.
3322849	3324910	Lord knows there haven't been enough class changes in WoW.
3325290	3329891	Well, you know, the good thing about MMOs is that they can keep changing it if it ain't broke.
3330834	3331495	or if it is broke.
3332496	3334938	Blizzard likes to break things a lot anyway.
3334958	3336499	Apparently I'm broken and I need to be changed.
3336559	3338061	If it's broke, break it more.
3339342	3340083	That's the way you do it.
3340103	3342725	Let's finish up the gaming news so we can get calls and end the show already.
3343286	3345347	Well, Nintendo is giving us a little love.
3345368	3348410	They're offering a Zelda feather stylus.
3349551	3350072	What?
3350152	3350492	See?
3350632	3351153	A feather?
3354036	3356518	It's this transparent feather-shaped plastic thing.
3357250	3360152	And that puts the nail in the coffin on those stories All right
3383288	3386189	Well, we're going to be getting to the Skype line very soon.
3386629	3389030	But one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.
3389050	3395993	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3396053	3398954	So we look forward to hearing your calls very soon.
3398994	3399894	But first, one more story.
3401595	3409218	Well, unfortunately, I guess Rockstar is going to be giving out a Manhunt 2 themed Wii.
3409438	3412279	What's disappointing about the whole thing is the whole artwork is...
3413109	3413830	Airbrush Airbrush
3433854	3435396	Do you think they'll just have a lady on her period sit on it?
3435436	3436056	Oh my god!
3457968	3461510	It's like having Extifer on the show again.
3461751	3462611	I know, totally.
3462971	3464752	Alright, Skyblind is open.
3464772	3465713	Give us a call.
3465733	3467314	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3467434	3468415	The calls are already coming in.
3468755	3469856	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3469876	3470256	Who's this?
3471317	3472057	Hey, it's Ranma.
3472077	3472718	What's up, everyone?
3472818	3474319	Hello, Ranma.
3474379	3475419	What's up?
3475459	3476000	How you doing?
3477140	3477861	I'm doing good.
3477901	3480763	I'm recovering from yet another convention I went to this weekend.
3481463	3482784	What convention did you go to this weekend?
3484036	3492681	It's Manga Next, a smaller, low-key convention geared towards Japanese comics and panels and cool stuff like that.
3493021	3494642	And really quickly, sum us up for the con.
3494683	3495423	What was the highlights?
3498045	3507450	The 18-plus stuff, like 18-plus Yaoi, Yuri, dating game, the 18-plus match game that I ran, and cosplay chess.
3508091	3508651	That's right.
3508691	3511893	You asked us if you could steal the match game from us to play at the con, huh?
3512836	3513276	I remember that.
3513596	3515838	I was like, dude, it's a Mark Goodson production.
3515898	3518899	It's not really our idea, so you'd rip it off just like we would.
3518959	3519499	So there you go.
3519880	3520600	That's okay.
3520960	3527283	We recorded the whole thing, so I'm going to try to dump it to DVD, so I'll send you guys a copy of it and see how lewd and raunchy we got.
3527904	3528184	All right.
3528244	3528684	Sounds good.
3528944	3530425	So what else is going on in your gaming world?
3532526	3533306	Not too much.
3534307	3540130	From listening from last week, I figured I would call in and get a much better review of Digital Life.
3541874	3545595	Alright, I swear to God, if we get into the DDR contest, this is going to be a short call.
3546756	3549816	Well, I wasn't even there for that.
3550316	3551097	Oh, thank God.
3551137	3552817	Alright, so then what was your review of Digital Life?
3554638	3558579	The rate between a scale from 1 to 10, I'd have to give it a 6.5.
3559399	3562980	I've gone to 3 out of 4 past Digital Life.
3563100	3564360	Last year, it was bad.
3565050	3572372	in terms of there's more vendors, there's more companies, more distributors showing off newer products and selling cool stuff.
3572413	3575954	This year, it was like as if they really couldn't get too much of anything.
3576834	3583356	I mean, last year, GameCap was having a Street Fighter 3 tournament giving out a lot of cool stuff.
3583796	3588198	You had Guitar Hero 2, Justice League Heroes, a bunch of other cool games.
3588878	3592039	And you had like two different sets of pro gaming tournaments going on.
3592850	3598334	This year, the big things were the Namco display, even though it was the same one from last year.
3599755	3601936	They were there, you know, it was just a little bit bigger.
3602537	3604238	Best Buy and Geek Squad were there.
3605959	3610542	Intel showed up, they had, I think it was Global Gaming League out there this year with Dell.
3611163	3617087	And if you know any famous people that are handing out autographs, they have like a gamers lounge with the PMS clan.
3617985	3622148	and then like a little kid section for the kids to play games and stuff.
3624010	3625691	Why do you think things got downgraded this year?
3626812	3627792	That I don't know.
3627832	3634737	It didn't make any sense because when I got there, I got there Friday after work for about an hour or some change.
3635117	3642823	I'm expected to be packed full of people, full of vendors and exhibits and I didn't see it, you know?
3643891	3648735	Do you think there's any correlation to the downsizing of E3 causing this?
3649856	3661567	I have no idea because honestly what Digital Life is is more of an expo on the latest digital innovations and technologies and some cool games that are coming out this year.
3663588	3669834	Maybe what I think it was so many people went last year thinking it was going to be all of this and they figured it wasn't going to be so.
3670294	3670935	But the thing was
3671460	3682069	Almost everybody there got in for free because if you knew the proper code, which almost everybody knew, you'd save yourself about $7 for entrance for four straight days.
3683810	3692677	All right, so if you could give, just to kind of wrap things up here so we can get some more calls, if you had any piece of advice to give the digital life planners for next year's show, what would you say?
3692697	3692777	Okay.
3696024	3697384	Keep the same people you got here.
3697445	3698665	Get some newer people.
3698705	3701726	If you really want to expand more into the game, get more companies in there.
3702606	3704327	More free swag, definitely.
3705187	3706368	All right, more free swag.
3706828	3707848	Free is always a good thing.
3707908	3708768	Free stuff is always a good thing.
3708848	3709509	Oh, definitely.
3709609	3709829	All right.
3710009	3712890	Well, Ranma, thanks so much for the call.
3712930	3715351	Any last-minute words you want to give our folks here?
3717071	3717771	I love you, Irene.
3718712	3720833	Oh, I love you too, Ranma.
3721253	3721553	All right.
3722573	3723113	Bye, Ranma.
3723153	3723774	Take care.
3723874	3724874	Come back out here and see us.
3725809	3726990	I will, I promise.
3727290	3728010	Alright, you better.
3728570	3728850	Alright.
3729791	3731351	Give us a call.
3731371	3735013	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3735033	3735793	Let's go to the phones.
3736373	3737433	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3737473	3737914	Who's this?
3739834	3741575	Hola, como estas?
3742115	3743736	Hi, Extifer.
3745436	3746417	Hi, Extifer.
3746477	3746937	What?
3747077	3748137	We were just talking about you.
3748157	3749518	I know, your ears must have been burning.
3751019	3751479	Oh, really?
3751619	3752319	No, I didn't hear.
3752399	3753459	I haven't been listening.
3753499	3754180	I've been watching...
3759624	3761085	How did you know to call us?
3762526	3770272	Because I got a text from Myrene saying you guys are taking calls.
3770332	3774415	Well, is there anything you would like to share that's gaming-oriented with your week?
3777477	3777958	Sure.
3778298	3782001	I love Puzzle Quest and WoW still.
3782281	3783642	Oh, Christopher, guess what?
3784266	3790471	Did Annie tell you that I'm moving my orc from Elder Thalys, my 38, to Ravencrest?
3791692	3792092	Really?
3792112	3792512	Yeah.
3792532	3793353	Oh my goodness.
3793433	3795595	So I'm actually going to play on that server now.
3796976	3799518	That's awesome news.
3799678	3800819	Hey Christopher, it's Eddie the Gay.
3801419	3802500	How's your iPhone doing?
3804382	3807744	My iPhone is doing absolutely wonderful.
3807924	3809866	Thank you for asking.
3810066	3810787	I miss it a lot.
3812128	3812468	You do?
3813755	3815335	Yes, I'm Eddie and I do.
3815916	3818196	This hasn't raked yet like everybody else's.
3819356	3820597	What the hell happened to this show?
3820777	3823497	I mean, it's like our 250th fucking episode, for God's sake.
3824058	3826918	I always derail the show.
3826998	3828599	It's my power.
3828679	3829659	It's your mutant power.
3829679	3831500	Hey, XFR, say titty juice.
3831700	3832000	No.
3833660	3834520	Titty juice?
3834540	3834620	What?
3838345	3840266	At least he didn't talk about bleached assholes.
3840286	3845228	Did you hear that Puzzle Quest is supposed to be the next week's release on Xbox Live Arcade?
3846509	3847189	That's nice.
3847229	3848850	I'm still playing it on my DS.
3849350	3851651	Will you give Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live a try?
3851971	3852611	No, I'm not.
3852671	3854232	I'm Christopher and I will not.
3855512	3856052	Why not?
3856853	3857513	Because it's stupid.
3857533	3859414	I don't have an Xbox 360.
3860534	3860914	Silly.
3861234	3862415	Well, what if you had one?
3862515	3863455	Let's imagine you had one.
3863475	3865116	Would you pay the $15 to download it?
3865236	3866277	No, my hands would fall off.
3866377	3866577	No.
3868873	3870815	What is your problem, Rice Princess?
3871196	3873318	This is Xtofer.
3873478	3874459	Sorry, Xtofer.
3874519	3875320	What's your problem?
3876381	3876982	Xbox 360.
3877042	3880405	Wait, so what were you guys saying about me before I called?
3881266	3883068	That's something about how you derail the show.
3883148	3883829	And look!
3884469	3885150	Look what happened.
3886355	3887716	I know, look at me.
3890217	3899622	I just want to take a moment and let everybody know that you guys need to think about me in the next two hours, because I might find out if I get a promotion at work.
3900062	3906025	I know that has nothing to do with video games, but think of me while you're playing your video games.
3906105	3907886	Yes, it does, because you're going to level up at work.
3908746	3909306	Grats.
3909787	3910267	I will.
3910647	3911888	I will level up at work.
3911928	3912508	I'll be part of
3913166	3914926	Infinity to Pwnage, man.
3915727	3916907	Yeah, man.
3918487	3923688	No matter what win or lose on the job thing, we're still going to go to Disneyland in a couple weeks and celebrate, right?
3923708	3925649	What does it have to do with video games, Rob?
3925729	3931750	Because, because, this is what it has to do with video games, because we're going to Disneyland and we're going to be in L.A.
3931790	3934151	at the same time E for All is going on, but we're not going to E for All.
3934171	3938572	By the way, by the way, a moment of silence from my premium annual pass, which expired today.
3940782	3944063	Did you know that you could play WoW at Disneyland for $6 an hour?
3944443	3945484	Why would I do that?
3945604	3945884	Why?
3946144	3948806	I didn't say you were going to, but you have the ability to.
3948826	3949046	Really?
3949106	3949646	Where is that?
3949666	3951007	Because that's kind of a novelty thing.
3951607	3952608	Why would you want to know?
3952648	3953428	You wouldn't do that.
3953448	3953828	I'm just curious.
3953848	3955029	I'm going to take pictures of people who do.
3955049	3956730	Fuck if I know anything I've ever been to Disneyland.
3956750	3957090	Jeez.
3957270	3957930	Someone just told me.
3958170	3958671	Gosh.
3958731	3959691	Look it up, noob.
3959711	3960692	Stop being so poor.
3961252	3961552	No.
3961652	3961932	All right.
3962893	3963553	I want to be poor.
3963613	3963833	All right.
3963913	3965774	Any last words for our listeners, Extifer?
3967795	3968776	Um, die.
3969304	3970524	No, I'm kidding.
3970584	3971784	Live, people, live.
3972285	3972705	Rude.
3972825	3973565	All right, live.
3973625	3974405	Just live.
3974425	3975125	You're beautiful.
3975365	3975765	Bye.
3976685	3978166	Bye, Christopher.
3978326	3978606	Bye.
3980286	3981866	All right, let's get some more calls.
3981926	3991588	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3991648	3992768	Waiting for some calls.
3992868	3994208	Just waiting for some calls.
3997049	3998009	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3998029	3998349	Who's this?
3999409	4000289	It's GS68.
4000409	4001189	Hello, GS68.
4001289	4001949	What's on your mind, buddy?
4003230	4005010	I'm still playing Maximum Tune 3.
4005110	4006530	I finally got the soundtrack this week.
4007090	4007491	Damn it.
4007591	4009091	I saw somebody linked me.
4009131	4015492	I don't know if it was you or somebody linked me to where I could obtain the soundtrack for a low, low, low cost.
4016212	4016972	Zero.
4017512	4018673	No, it was just a very low cost.
4018693	4019893	What soundtrack?
4020513	4021413	Midnight Maximum Tune 3.
4021733	4025234	Oh, that just really sucks that you don't have that yet.
4025594	4026114	Do you have that?
4027739	4030260	Well, maybe you could play it for me.
4031480	4032920	Over and over.
4033080	4034121	On my iPod.
4034161	4038102	Anyway, okay, so tell me a little bit about Maximum Tune 3.
4038162	4039322	I would also like to hear it.
4039842	4040562	The soundtrack?
4041342	4041462	Mm-hmm.
4042743	4043803	Yeah, it's very good so far.
4043903	4049764	Like, especially, like, the songs.
4050244	4053805	Like, especially, like, one song that sticks out is, like, Black Pressure.
4053845	4056706	Like, it's not like the original...
4057239	4062400	Max and Toon Soundtrack, like, there's a song called Destination Black that's, like, the Blackbirds theme.
4062700	4064140	Why's it always gotta be about the black songs?
4065141	4073122	Yeah, well, this song, like, starts off with some choir chanting, and that's what, like, made it stand out from the other songs.
4074202	4078803	Like... But it's still Eurobeat, right?
4079804	4082164	Uh, no, mostly... Still... Uh, wait, Eurobeat?
4084705	4086885	This is my heart... No, you're thinking of Initial D, silly.
4087898	4089439	You think of initial D as the Eurobeat music?
4089739	4091801	Well, it still kind of is.
4091901	4094483	It's more of a Euro rave or something.
4094523	4095323	I don't know how to explain it.
4095584	4096064	But I'm glad.
4096764	4099486	Is number three as good of a soundtrack as number two, if not better?
4101428	4102248	Oh, I'm liking it better.
4102288	4106291	It has more... I'm worried about all the songs in my car.
4107192	4108213	Is it good driving music?
4109213	4112416	Yeah, it's pretty good, but only when you're driving...
4113850	4116292	Just make sure to obey those speed laws, son.
4117452	4120594	It's not very good music to listen to in traffic jams.
4121235	4124477	It's probably not, because then you want to run over the cars like it's burnout.
4124697	4131941	I just pause the music and rewind it back, because I don't want to be listening to that kind of music when I'm stopped, because it wouldn't feel right.
4133682	4136084	Alright, well, appreciate the review of the soundtrack.
4136164	4137885	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
4139306	4141407	Yeah, Jamie Moss' speed car is horrible.
4141987	4143208	It's an okay song, but it's
4143766	4145408	The cheesiest song I've ever heard.
4145568	4146228	Which song was this?
4146989	4149111	Speed Car, the one I was singing last week.
4149731	4150312	Oh, okay.
4151393	4152254	Cheesy.
4152434	4152694	All right.
4152714	4154696	All right, well, thank you, GS68, for the phone call.
4154736	4155216	Appreciate it.
4156177	4156598	No problem.
4156938	4157478	Take care, buddy.
4158599	4158980	All right.
4159560	4161622	We'll do one more call.
4161642	4164685	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4165546	4166126	Give us a call.
4166166	4166607	We'll talk.
4167708	4168108	Our number is 555-4444.
4168188	4168929	No, just kidding.
4172110	4172890	We're waiting for that call.
4172910	4173371	Oh, here we go.
4173471	4174591	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4174611	4174932	Who's this?
4176592	4177333	This is Pooh Face.
4177993	4178654	Pooh Face.
4178734	4179574	What's on your mind, buddy?
4181475	4186658	I was just going to say how I'm really looking forward to Half-Life 2, the orange box.
4187318	4189560	What is it about the orange box that has you so excited?
4190940	4196003	I've just been really... I really got into Half-Life 2 and Portal looks really sweet.
4196163	4198604	Like, I played the...
4200238	4215850	Project thing, the Narbacular Drop game, that was pretty cool, but it was really short, and Portal looks like it's going to make it a lot better, and of course there's Half-Life 2 Episode 2, which continues the story of Half-Life 2, and Team Fortress 2, I've been playing the beta for a couple weeks, that's pretty sweet.
4215930	4223396	All I'm hoping is that later on as a downloadable piece that they have Gary's mod, because that would be so awesome.
4223897	4225798	It's my crappiezy at home, can't write Half-Life 2.
4226478	4233441	Um, Portal is, it looks kind of interesting, but I can't help but think, didn't Prey have something similar, where, like, you had little portals, but... No one played Prey!
4233521	4235121	I know, that's just, I played Prey!
4235181	4238103	Like, the one first-person shooter I did play was Prey.
4238623	4239243	I beat Prey.
4239443	4240163	I played Prey.
4240183	4241324	Yeah, I beat Prey.
4241344	4249467	That was pretty cool, and that was what got me looking at Portal, because I thought the Portals and Prey were pretty cool, but... I think they just switched the graphics and made it the same game.
4250647	4251068	Yeah, um...
4252626	4253087	It's the first month.
4253107	4253787	It's the first month, hang on.
4253807	4256309	Even if you don't like first person shooters, it's not even necessarily a first person shooter.
4256329	4257310	It's more of a first person puzzle game.
4257330	4258051	It's really original and
4280228	4287574	It just looks like a lot of fun, and especially for the PC version, because people are going to be coming out with mods, like for multiplayer probably, and custom maps.
4289475	4296081	No, that's fair, because I liked Metroid for that reason, just because it's not a shooter really, it's like an adventure, first person adventure game, so, good stuff.
4296341	4297822	That, you're a total Nintendo fanboy.
4297982	4298442	Yeah, whatever.
4298743	4301925	No, but I don't like first person shooters on any system, even PC, so.
4301985	4303186	I get uber motion sick.
4303606	4306208	Alright, anyhow, sorry Poohface, you had another thought I cut you off from.
4306229	4306269	Uh...
4309645	4314466	But yeah, I've also been looking forward to Guitar Hero 3, obviously.
4314666	4316266	I'm totally looking forward to Guitar Hero 3.
4316866	4317446	Me too.
4317486	4318747	Because I actually have a guitar.
4319087	4322247	So it's like I only have to buy the game and no fucking peripheral this time.
4322607	4327208	Unlike Rock Band where I'm going to have to buy the Uber box where nobody's going to want to come over and play with me.
4328448	4331569	Yeah, I'm actually getting Drum Mania instead of Rock Band.
4331609	4333669	Are you importing the one from Japan?
4338374	4338694	Yeah.
4339015	4339735	That's hardcore.
4339775	4345539	But I don't have the money to get the arcade-style DTX drum set, so I'm just getting the Konami controller.
4346019	4346640	Well, there you go.
4347560	4349622	That'll do, as long as it gets you through the game.
4349782	4350542	That's all that's important.
4351063	4355986	All right, well, it sounds like you have a very busy gaming next couple of months between Orange Box and Drum Mania.
4356006	4356847	You're going to be very busy.
4357427	4359068	Any other last-minute thoughts for our listeners?
4360809	4360989	No.
4361430	4361670	All right.
4361890	4363311	Well, Pooface, thank you very much for the call.
4363992	4364572	Have a wonderful week.
4364612	4365272	All right.
4365292	4366113	Hope to hear from you again.
4366233	4366433	Yeah.
4366893	4367154	All right.
4367214	4367554	Bye-bye.
4368356	4369736	PooFace hasn't been listening for a little while.
4369776	4373357	He just returned tonight for our 250th episode, so happy to hear from him.
4373637	4376918	I'd like to remind everybody that I had the orange box last year.
4378178	4378398	Hmm?
4378978	4380899	Yeah, I had the orange box last year.
4380919	4382119	In fact, I still have it.
4382139	4383520	I don't really use it too much, though.
4383860	4385820	Isn't that what you called something of yours?
4385900	4386200	I don't know.
4386340	4386980	All right, what?
4387821	4389001	Hello, Young Orange Songs Radio.
4390061	4391061	It's Raven Stolfen.
4391561	4392402	I missed you, Bucket.
4393022	4393302	Hello.
4394645	4399147	We just want to wish you a happy 250th episode from the Techie Game Podcast
4422020	4423221	and now we're number 14.
4423281	4425762	We're slightly getting back up there.
4426182	4429524	We're number 69, which is an okay place to be, honestly.
4429884	4434386	It's hilarious.
4434726	4435907	That's my producer, Toki.
4435927	4437027	She produces the show.
4437247	4440549	Wow, there's a lot of you.
4440909	4441569	Oh, it's a girl.
4441669	4441970	Hello.
4442670	4446892	She's my co-host.
4446932	4447932	God, what was I going to ask?
4448013	4448373	I don't know.
4449676	4450296	Is she hot?
4450556	4452477	Rice Princess wants to know if she's hot.
4452517	4454437	Why are you... I think so.
4454998	4455338	Alright.
4455358	4459599	Yeah, Raven and her, you know, they've been together for like six months now.
4459639	4461539	Is there a little showmance going on?
4461719	4463800	Is there a showmance going on on Tekken games?
4464400	4465681	No, no, no, no.
4465741	4466361	Not at all, Scott.
4466401	4467681	Okay, it's all a publicity stunt.
4467941	4471062	I can hear her in the background going, What's your publicity stunt here?
4471082	4472122	I'm not your publicity stunt!
4472162	4476224	Well, Rook tried to fake it like you guys had a child or something that was illegitimate.
4476324	4477024	He never did.
4478064	4479885	Sorry, we did call in for something, Sky.
4480125	4481606	We want to talk about the Orange Box.
4482046	4484927	Ah, it's all the rage this week.
4484967	4490089	It would make sense that people think the Orange Lounge show is about the Orange Box, so we forgive the confusion.
4490109	4491190	Orange Box Radio.
4491370	4492690	Tell us about the Orange Box.
4492710	4493811	Did you see the commercial?
4493851	4497792	We should call our show next week Orange Box Radio, just to fuck with people.
4498373	4498893	It is stupid.
4498933	4500214	All right, what do you want to say about Orange Box?
4500494	4503415	Did you see the commercial for the Orange Box?
4504344	4504904	Yes, I did.
4505084	4506685	It was during the Sarah Silverman program.
4506725	4508006	I saw the commercial for the Orange Box.
4508026	4509787	Did you hear what they said about Half-Life?
4510307	4511388	Oh God, you were watching that.
4511588	4514109	No, what did, or what, like Game of the Year or something?
4514710	4516551	Yeah, greatest game ever.
4516711	4518792	Greater than Zelda, greater than anything.
4519312	4520033	Greatest game ever.
4520253	4523575	I loved it that they said, this is the game of the year in 2002.
4527997	4533440	But it's, well, I mean, like, come on, when they sell movies, like when they do, when they do like DVDs.
4534415	4534956	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4554540	4556122	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4573259	4575100	Hey, our podcast is award winning.
4575120	4576321	We've won awards.
4576341	4578181	We got like two thumbs up from some guy.
4578221	4582343	We go like, hey, we're a four-time nominee for Best of Life 365 in 2003.
4582983	4584104	Yeah, look at the iTunes store.
4584124	4585444	We got some good reviews, man.
4585464	4587305	None of that pew-pew-pew shit.
4587325	4588406	We got some good reviews.
4590626	4591807	We don't get some mew-mew-mews.
4591847	4592987	We got some good stuff.
4593007	4594188	People saying we're the greatest.
4594248	4596529	I mean, you should get on here so people can hear you.
4597898	4598518	You got awards.
4598799	4599119	All right.
4599639	4602641	Well, guys, we've got to let you go because we've got to wrap up the show because, damn, we've been going a long time.
4602701	4603201	It's okay.
4603221	4604562	Thank you for letting us get on.
4604602	4605083	You're welcome.
4605383	4607024	Have a good one, you guys.
4607064	4607364	You too.
4607904	4608125	Bye.
4608685	4609225	Bye.
4609445	4610066	Bye, producer.
4610426	4610886	Have a good one.
4612087	4612527	Bye.
4612547	4613208	They hung up on us.
4615849	4616530	See you later.
4617611	4617891	All right.
4617951	4618331	That's it.
4618391	4619632	We're going to close up the Skype line.
4619652	4621533	Thank you guys very much for calling in tonight.
4621553	4621993	It was fun.
4622354	4625015	But now we need to wrap up the show because we've been going a long time tonight.
4625055	4626396	First, any last-minute stories?
4626756	4626977	Yes.
4627297	4627577	All right.
4628052	4629993	Okay, a couple just real small here.
4631234	4635736	The simple series, one of my favorite things to talk about from D3, is coming to the Wii.
4636897	4638417	And I have the first few titles.
4639358	4641319	These are all, of course, coming to Japan.
4641719	4646542	The first one is the Mina de Kart Race.
4647022	4647422	Mina.
4647842	4649963	The Mina de Kart Race.
4650143	4650984	Everybody Kart Race.
4651084	4652164	Yes, Everybody Kart Race.
4652485	4653885	It's slated for October 25th.
4654746	4656967	And then they also have Mina de...
4657956	4665425	Bassuri Taikai, or the Everybody's Fishing Conference, also coming out on the 25th.
4667368	4667808	Wow.
4668309	4670532	The Party Casino coming in December.
4670792	4673195	The Shooting Action coming in December.
4675900	4687622	the Block Kuzushi, or the Block Destructions, coming out February next year, and the YY Combat, which I have no translation for, also coming in February.
4688082	4696144	And I guess the Onichanbara R is supposed to be coming out to the Wii, and that's that one for those who don't remember.
4696564	4701125	It's the sexy zombie killer game, which is basically the chick wearing just a...
4702176	4703437	No, it's not the fishing conference game.
4703477	4704058	I don't know.
4704118	4705119	I'm going to be busy playing that.
4723717	4732943	Nintendo's supposedly working on a game that's going to support the Wii balance board that's going to be a snowboarding title and rumors are that it's going to be the 1080 game coming back.
4733323	4735104	So, maybe.
4735384	4739967	I mean, I'm assuming someday there'll be a snowboarding game that'll support that.
4740367	4746831	And then finally, one piece of Wii accessories that will not be coming out to the market will be
4747701	4750022	The Nyko Wii Party Station.
4750062	4755725	If you remember, that's that stupid thing that they had to hold controllers, chips and soda, and all sorts of stuff like that.
4756045	4764009	Apparently, originally they were marketing it as $25, but it ended up having to come out for the price of $50.
4765790	4768051	And so no one decided to buy it.
4768992	4773074	Oh, and by the way, it also had LED scoreboards for your Wii tournaments.
4774494	4775815	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4798649	4801670	Well, that is going to bring our 250th episode to a close.
4802050	4803290	And that deserves applause.
4803310	4804250	Thank God it's over.
4804871	4805171	All right.
4805831	4807711	But first we have to get everybody's final thoughts.
4807851	4809312	So we'll start off with DarkSakura.
4809532	4811432	Your final thought tonight.
4812092	4812713	I like beer.
4813733	4814153	Do you now?
4814313	4815453	Is there any particular type of beer?
4815753	4816494	I like Newcastle.
4816914	4817194	All right.
4818354	4819794	We'll go around in a circle here.
4819834	4821395	Casper the Gay, your final thought tonight.
4821435	4822315	Thanks for being here, by the way.
4822735	4825076	When you play video games, children's do learn.
4827111	4827352	What?
4828974	4829595	Alrighty.
4831919	4833341	Rice Princess, your final thought.
4834463	4835044	Bye.
4836606	4837548	Loki, your final thought.
4839105	4845566	And just when you thought Sony was done with releasing new SKUs, there is another rumor coming out of Japan.
4845906	4849067	About a 160 gigabyte PS3 system.
4849467	4855148	Oh yes, this will come with 160 gigabytes of memory on your hard drive there.
4855468	4861550	It will also feature six USB ports, two HDMI outs, and the three Ethernet ports.
4861930	4864310	Much like the original design they showed.
4864870	4868231	And this, actually, they have a brand new SKU that's been logged in.
4870240	4872281	and it will do your dishes and suck your dick.
4872381	4875642	In related news, Japanese men everywhere are marrying their PlayStations.
4875863	4878924	Why the fuck does it need three fucking Ethernet ports is what I want to know.
4879304	4882606	Seriously, what the fuck do you need that many Ethernet ports for?
4884847	4889609	Wow.
4889949	4890269	All right.
4890409	4891149	Is that it, Loki?
4891730	4892290	That's it.
4892390	4898372	And I'm sure, as with all other Sony rumors, it will probably become true soon enough.
4899193	4899513	All right.
4900591	4901571	Puppy, your final thought.
4901611	4902532	Thank you for being here tonight.
4903092	4903692	My final thought?
4904132	4904312	Yes.
4904632	4905432	Believe.
4906893	4907253	All right.
4908333	4909173	My final thought.
4909193	4910714	Master Chief will save us.
4911234	4915715	My final thought is 250 episodes later, and you know what?
4916375	4917936	George Takei is still awesome.
4919316	4921257	He is still fucking awesome.
4921717	4922197	Oh, my.
4923621	4926123	Alright, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.
4926323	4929545	Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.
4930066	4932247	If you like what you hear, remember we do this shit for free.
4932527	4934109	All we ask is for a little word of mouth.
4934569	4935429	Just go advertise.
4935469	4936470	Tell two people about our show.
4936730	4941254	If you have no friends, or even if you do have friends, leave a comment on the iTunes.
4941274	4942755	Am I Ron Popeil now?
4942835	4943395	Am I Ron Popeil?
4944036	4945717	For only three low payments of $39.99.
4945957	4946137	No!
4946177	4946377	No!
4946397	4947798	Three low payments of $14.95.
4947878	4948519	Forget it.
4952574	4956356	What was it that Mitch Hedberg said?
4956957	4958978	Three easy payments and one difficult payment?
4959499	4959799	Yes.
4961400	4964542	I think that was actually the other guy.
4964762	4965563	That was Mitch Hedberg.
4966163	4967804	I just listened to this on Friday at work.
4967984	4969705	Sorry, I thought you said Dane Cook for some reason.
4970125	4973908	No, Dane Cook would have just made obnoxious noises and then talked about his penis.
4974769	4981413	No, the thing was I somehow got my list of comedians who died mixed with comedians I wish would die.
4982378	4982938	Just kidding.
4982998	4984138	I don't wish death on anyone.
4984158	4985079	That's really mean.
4985299	4985999	I love Dane Cook.
4986059	4986359	No, I don't.
4986859	4987159	All right.
4988379	4989859	Anyway, can we end the show now, please?
4990099	4990379	Thank you.
4990580	4990780	All right.
4990800	4991160	Bye-bye.
