Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, October the 28th, 2007

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
for this Part B of our program.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Since we already talked about our gaming weeks and all that stuff in Part A,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
you can hear about my injury and all that fun stuff.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
You gotta go back in the archives though and grab Part A because we're already in the second half.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
And in the second half we started off with gaming news.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Loki, what do you got for us?

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
Anyways, what I got for you is a brand new thing that they're adding to the Wii Virtual Console.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
It's the ability to give games as gifts apparently.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
So you can purchase a Virtual Console game and then put one of your friends' names on there

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
and it will automatically send them a message allowing them to download the game.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
So that's kind of cool except it doesn't address the fact that what if the person already has the game.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
That's exactly what I want to know. What if somebody tries to send me a game which I already have?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Too bad, I guess. I don't know.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Huh.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
I think that they should have the option where you can send, and this should be in all the online things,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
at least in Microsoft, they should have an option where you can send people points.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Without having to go buy one of those cards that's taxed?

01:32.000 --> 01:41.000
Example, I have my account on Live and then I have those four other Xbox 360s.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Say I want to download a map or something on all of them.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I don't want to fucking have to put in billing information for five different 360s.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
I'd rather just send 200 points it costs to buy this map to each one.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I don't know why you can't do that.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Can't you just tie it to your Live name and then go on each?

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
No, because you have to have a different name for each one because it has to be tied to that account.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
It's stupid. Interesting.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
So this basically sounds like it's something that's in the very early stages that they haven't really mapped out

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
like how you're going to give the gifts or any of that yet, right?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.000
Was it supposed to be some massive Wii update last month that didn't actually end up happening?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Do you think it'll be here in time for the holiday season which is just around the corner?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I hope so. I hope they have that.

02:28.000 --> 02:35.000
I'm kind of curious what they're plotting because you know how Nintendo likes to slowly pull off the wrapping on things, you know what I mean?

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
Well, anyhow, the one thing that's getting the wrapping pulled off of it this week is Virtual Console in Japan.

02:42.000 --> 02:51.000
The Virtual Console release has come out in Japan on Tuesdays and this week in Japan they got a little game called

02:51.000 --> 02:58.000
Downtown Nekkitsu Koshinyoku Soroyuki Daikodai.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
I know what that is.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
What would you call that?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
We would call that River City Ransom in the US.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
That's right. You would call it River City Ransom.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
I have the TurboGrafx CD version.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
That's right. So I came out on the Virtual Console this week for 600 Wii points.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Donkey Kong Country 2 also came out.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Dinah Brothers 2 Special came out as well as Choaniki came out.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm not even kidding.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Somebody brought that up in part A.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
Choaniki came out as well and then Ragai Blues Journey.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
But what should be pointed out, I believe one of these games, wasn't that a Sega Channel game or something like that?

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
The Dinah Brothers 2?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I believe it might have been.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
So kind of interesting there that, wait a minute, Sega Channel?

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
What kind of thing does this open up the Virtual Console to?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
How about some Nintendo Channel releases?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Or what did they call that?

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
Was it the BS or something?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
The Satellaview.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Yeah, Satellaview, that's it.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
BS was what it was for short.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
So that would be cool if we got the Zelda remake over here and that kind of stuff.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I've played a ROM of it.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Maybe I'm just dreaming a little bit. I don't know.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Well, for our friends in the UK, they get some cool stuff.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
The coolest being Yoshi's Story that was on the Nintendo 64 for a thousand Wii points.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Yoshi's Story was a very, very cute game.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
That's all I have to say.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
And, as I mentioned in part A, Super Air Zonk! Rockabilly Paradise!

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Which was a Turbo CD shooter.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
They've removed a few of the graphical features to it.

04:34.000 --> 04:42.000
And they have instead basically just beefed up the soundtrack a bit.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
So, Super Air Zonk.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
And also, Magician Lord 900 points.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
It's a Neo Geo game.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
I have yet to download a Neo Geo game onto my Wii.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
I just, I don't know.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Get Magician Lord.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I kind of want it, but I don't know.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Magician Lord is great.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Magician Lord is one of those games that are like, ooh, it was so awesome.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And then I downloaded it ten years ago.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Wow, this wasn't that good. What the hell was I thinking on that?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I remember it being very hard.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
That's like how Virtual Console does all of its businesses off of reactions like that.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
Like, oh, remember this game? This game was awesome.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
And then you download it and you're like, wait, no it wasn't.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
That's why they don't have demos.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
I guess, probably.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
You know, we still need to do Super Metroid, Rob.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
We do.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Anyway.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Let's make it happen.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I can't do a lot of physical stuff this week thanks to my injury, so maybe we'll have to do it this week.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Dude, no, no, no.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
GS68 said it.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Blazing Star on Wii.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
It's like one of my favorite ever Neo Geo games.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
We'll see.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Polestar was a good game, but Blazing Star was freaking awesome.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Someday.

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
Apparently there's a rumor going around that Nintendo is planning on adding flash card support to the Nintendo DS.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
Now, I'm sure that there are, many people know that there is flash card support for the DS.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
In a not so official, not entirely legal way.

06:03.000 --> 06:14.000
But they will be, the rumor is that they're going to be offering this as part of a download service that will allow you to put Game Boy and Game Boy Color games onto your DS.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
Say, maybe via, I don't know, Virtual Console or something like that.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Where you can download your games using the little SD memory card.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Pop it out of your Wii, plug it into your DS and take it on the go.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
Hell, they should just do that with the NES games and stuff like that.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
That'd be fucking awesome.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
That'd be a really added value to the Virtual Console games I've already downloaded.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
But, of course, why would they have to give this to us for free, right?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Those charges to do that, right?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Exactly.

06:44.000 --> 06:50.000
Like I said earlier, Nintendo is all about, especially with these Virtual Console releases, us remembering,

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
wow, this game was awesome, and then we'll go, no it wasn't. Same thing with the Game Boy releases, right?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
But who knows, maybe Jamie will be able to get Kid Dracula through the service.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
That might be kind of cool for her.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Actually, I'd want to play it too.

07:03.000 --> 07:17.000
Here's a problem though I see with this, and I don't know how it would work, is how would you be able to say if I put a copy of Super Mario Land or something like that on my memory stick or whatever.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
And Super Mario Land will be one of those games.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Exactly.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
Let's say I put it on my SD memory card. How's that card going to know which DS it's going into?

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
For example, basically that would allow you to rip the ROMs and just distribute them freely.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
It'd be hard for them to be able to lock that down to one DS.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Why can't it just beam the game over the Wi-Fi?

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Because the DS has no internal memory to store the game.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
Once it's beamed over the Wi-Fi, you save it to the, I don't know, maybe you link it up with a unique ID, like a friend code type thing? I don't know.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
Well, I don't know. If you save it to like, maybe the friend code thing could work, I guess. I don't know. It would still be very hard.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Hmm.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
All right, well, coming out on the Nintendo Wii is a sequel to a very obscure game.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
I don't know if a lot of folks know about this game in the arcades.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
I think, if I remember right, you know how we're syndicated on AllGames.com, right?

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
AllGames has their daily show, the AllGames Interactive Show, and I think this is kind of an inside joke on their show is the game Crazy Climber,

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
which is this old game from the 80s, which was in the arcades.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
You basically played this guy crawling up the side of a building very slowly.

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
And I know that it's a joke on that show because they have that sound effect, the,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
oh no, whenever you fall off the building, right? Well, get this.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Crazy Climber is being remade for the Wii.

08:43.000 --> 08:47.000
And this just struck me as like very odd when I read about it. I'm like, really?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Out of like all the games they could pick, they're remaking Crazy Climber?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Who's publishing that?

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Crazy Climber is being made by Nihon Busan is doing the publisher there.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
Crazy Climber Wii is coming out. It kind of looks interesting from the screenshots,

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
but you actually use the Wii remote and the nunchuck to climb up the building,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
which is kind of an interesting concept, you have to say.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
The only thing that scares me about this, though, is the fact that they have a game like

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
Impossible Mission, or not, yeah, Impossible Mission, and they also had Spy Game,

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
what was that, Elevator Mission or some shit like that, that was really crappy.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
Well, you can pick different characters from the game to play as.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
And there's this one character called Fox who looks to be a foxy little girl,

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
or actually, big girl.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
So, you know, kind of a little spin on the 80s thing where the 80s thing only had the one guy,

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
and somebody actually in chat has posted the link to the clip.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Let me see if I can bring this up.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
This is a great radio right now while I go and retrieve that clip.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
Let's see, this is the death noise from the 80s Crazy Climber game.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Oh, no!

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah, so that's that cheesy little sound effect you'll hear whenever the character dies in the game.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
So, there you have it.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
So I wonder if that classic sound effect will actually come back in the new Crazy Climber.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Who knows?

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
Well, I'm thinking about modding my Wii, and this comes out in Japan on December 20th,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
so, you know, I'll be able to play region free.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
If you don't get locked out with some future dashboard update, be careful.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah, whatever.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Sorry, that's 360, but whatever, the interface update.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Alright, that's enough Crazy Climber.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
So crazy.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Thank God.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
No, I'm kidding.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
There's a rumor floating around, this is all purely speculation, honestly.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
I don't think there's much actual fact in this,

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
that Animal Crossing will be going the way of the MMO.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
I don't think it will happen anytime soon, if it does.

10:56.000 --> 11:04.000
And it's really all based off of Eguchi saying that they wanted to expand the connectivity to mobile phones and computers.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.000
All of Chinese fruit sellers, you know, shaking my trees, stealing my fruit.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Wow.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
Yeah, that's so, I don't even see how you can grasp that straw.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
No.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
If it's going to happen, it'll be much further down.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
You know, I could kind of see something like this happening for some reason.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I don't know, it just seems like a very logical,

11:25.000 --> 11:32.000
and maybe that's why this is grabbing all this steam around the internet and is catching a lot of, you know, whatever.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
They've been saying it for years, though.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
And it would make sense.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
I mean, God, it would totally change the game, too, because on the DS it kind of felt a little bit like we'd all played before.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
It felt forced.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Well, to be honest, I don't think they're going to do this,

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
because that would mean that Nintendo's actually getting with it, and we know that's not the case.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
They're going to be opening themselves up to a lot of trouble, and you know that Nintendo plays it safe.

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
Nintendo will decide, hey, you know what, let's run an Animal Crossing BBS, and then they'll go from there.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
And eventually you'll have your Animal Crossing chat room and your Animal Crossing game.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
I don't know, my gut tells me something like this is definitely possible.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I think this could happen.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
But we'll see.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
It'll happen, all right.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
In 2010.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
We'll see.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Or never.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I'm kind of afraid of it happening.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
If it is an MMO, I'm going to come to Jamie's Village all the time and shake her trees.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Who says I'll play it?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Oh, snap.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
If it went the route of MMO, I don't think I'd play it.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
What if it was free?

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
Like a Guild Wars style thing, or once you buy the game you can play it however much you want.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
If somebody gives me the game, sure.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
You're not the Animal Crossing addict you used to be.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
No, not really.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
It just got really boring for me, and I'm already playing a good MMO right now.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
We'll see what happens.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
Anyways, interesting rumor that got leaked out this week is that there was a new character coming,

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
or that hasn't been announced yet, coming to Smash Brothers.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
This actually happened via one of the voice actresses' blogs.

13:06.000 --> 13:13.000
Her personal webpage said the people that she's performing, the characters' voices for,

13:13.000 --> 13:20.000
include Zero Suit Samus, as well as Crystal from Star Fox Adventures.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
That, of course, was one of the ones that hasn't been announced yet.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
Crystal, the girl fox who's also in scanly clad blue.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
Of course, if you told me last week that King Dedede was going to be a character in the game,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I would have said, yeah, right.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
And then look what happened.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
By the way, that's too much Kirby in one game, I think.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
I know Kirby's great and all, but seriously, three characters, two of them a bit obscure.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
King Dedede and Meta Knight?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
I don't know.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
King Dedede is not obscure.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
I know, he's not obscure, but if you think of Kirby, you'd think of Kirby.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
What about that?

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Mr. Game & Watch was great.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Mr. Game & Watch was great.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
That was a good unlocked character.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
It was kind of a throwback to Nintendo's history.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
I think King Dedede is a good addition and all,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
but I think they should have just done away with Meta Knight in that case.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Who's a Meta Knight fan?

14:17.000 --> 14:21.000
There's a lot of people now, but I don't know who the fuck King Dedede is.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
All that reminds me of is fucking Carlos Mencia.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
You know what?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Tiger Claw has a really good point in our chat room.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
chat.orangelandrager.com

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
Keep in mind, the creator of Smash Bros. Brawl also created Kirby.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
So, damn good point.

14:36.000 --> 14:44.000
Well, he's also created this, which for the Nintendo Wii is something a little bit unheard of,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
which is getting people very excited.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
And of course, there's another target Smash mode yet again.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
We see this often in the Smash Bros. game.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
There's going to be a new target Smash mode in the game,

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
but what's very cool about it is that you can actually send your replays through target Smash mode

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
to other people on your Wii console friends list.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
They even show pictures of it happening.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
So a lot of us are like, oh my gosh, we don't see a whole lot of this Wii Connect 24 thing going on right now.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
Like you have that one random EllaBits thing and a couple other,

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
but you don't see a whole lot of this like send game stuff to friends.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
So, very cool that this looks like it's going to be happening.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
A real quick quote from the article.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Quote, this time you can view replays.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
What this means is the game records what you did in brawls or in target Smash and lets you review it.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
And you can record up to three minutes of data.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
So not just in the target mode.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
It looks like you can actually do this in the actual brawls.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
That's going to be fun.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Now the next thing is we need to be able to post them to the internet.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Download them there, kind of like Halo 3.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Imagine some of the brawl matches we'd see on the site ready to download.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
That might be kind of fun. We'll see.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
Well, I'll tell you what is very happy for me is a zombie game on the DS.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
I love zombies.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Zombies are pretty awesome.

15:55.000 --> 16:02.000
Ignition is releasing a game called Teenage Zombies Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Which is the best name ever.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I was a teenage zombie?

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
No, Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies.

16:10.000 --> 16:21.000
And it's basically the world is taken over by an alien or something called the big brain and the army of brain thingies.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
And so these zombies rise from their grave.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Rise from your grave.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
They're immune to the brain thingy ray and start eating people.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
That's great.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
What exactly do you do in the game?

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
It has a bunch of stylus mini games and boss battles and puzzles.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
Yay, mini games and puzzles. Just what the DS needed.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
But it's zombies.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
And it's supposed to play out sort of comic book style.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Well, that might be kind of cool.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
But it has the word thingy in it and that's great.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Maybe instead of Mario Party we need Zombie Party.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
That might be kind of fun. Or Zombie Mario Party.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
We need Romero Party.

16:58.000 --> 17:05.000
You know, I'm going to stop here right there with the whole zombie teenager thing.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Ignition. What games have they put out?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
What, you mean they can't judge a game based on its title alone? What does this world come to?

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Yeah, remember that other game, Monster Madness? How awesome that was?

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Oh wait, I'm sorry. It was not awesome. It was crap.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
We had zombies. You know what, we need a remake of Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
I knew somehow we could not get through Zombie Stories without that game coming up.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
It was great.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
That's what Monster Madness was sort of trying to be, but it sure as hell was not.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
It failed with a pH.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
Anyways, so moving on.

17:40.000 --> 17:51.000
Some interesting stuff. Of course, not a huge surprise, but there's going to be yet another Castlevania game on the DS.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Big surprise there.

17:54.000 --> 18:01.000
Of course, producer Koji Igarashi said the first thing we're doing is another DS version.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
It hasn't been an official announcement, but we're doing it.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
And that, of course, wasn't in here.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Well then that would be the official announcement.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
That was in an interview with Game Life.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
They're going to be doing a new DS version.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
More Castlevania? Or what do they call that? Metroidvania?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Metroidvania.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Metroidvania? That would be kind of fun.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
I made tonight's show roll, so I guess I'm okay in saying this and not spoiling anything,

18:31.000 --> 18:38.000
is saying that I heard somewhere that they were actually thinking about for a 3D Castlevania,

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
kind of borrowing from Metroid again and doing a 3D Castlevania in the style of Metroid Prime.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
That could be very interesting, especially if it has the Wii controls,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
because the Wii controls on Metroid Prime are kind of fun.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
So imagine how that could be.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
I don't want to do that. I think that whole whipping thing might be kind of lame,

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
but it might be interesting.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Can you imagine Castlevania and the Metroid Prime 3 engine?

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
It could be interesting.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
That would be fairly cool.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I don't know yet. It's iffy, obviously.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
It's a very iffy thing.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
It's a very iffy thing.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Well, last segment we were talking about Spore,

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
and of course a lot of folks are very excited about Spore and Will Wright.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
He's the man.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
But Will Wright made a pretty bold statement this week.

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
He said that the Wii is the only next-gen console.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
He said in an interview, quote, somebody asked me what I thought Next Generation meant,

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
and what about the PlayStation 3 was Next Generation.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
The only next-gen system I've seen is the Wii.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
The PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 feel like better versions of the last,

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
but pretty much the same game with incremental improvement.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
That was in an interview with The Guardian Unlimited.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
It goes on to say, quote, not that the graphics are more powerful,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
but that it hits a completely different demographic

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
in regards to how the Wii feels like a major jump.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
So coming from a major gaming mind,

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
a pretty bold statement there.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
It's kind of interesting because a lot of people call Wii

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
and Nintendo themselves call this the new generation.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
The Wii is going off over here in this direction,

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
whereas the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are doing a little bit more of the same but prettier.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
So it's very interesting that Will Wright steps in and says,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
no, no, the Wii is the one that is really the next generation

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
because it's not doing the same old thing.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Shut up, you people.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Don't know anything. That's what I have to say about that.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Make your damn games and be quiet.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
This is next generation.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Listen, they're all fucking new consoles.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
They're all next generation.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Shut the hell up.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
That's what I want to say.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
If I made a new 16-bit console,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
that would still be another generation console

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
because it has come out in this generation of consoles.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
You know what? There is no next gen.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
There's only current.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Next gen is stuff that doesn't exist yet.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
I just like that you just told Will Wright to shut up.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Fine. Seventh generation console, I guess,

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
because this is, I think, the seventh generation of consoles.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
Isn't technically for the PlayStation that would technically be third, wouldn't it?

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
No, it's in the history of time.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
This is the seventh generation of consoles.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Wikipedia ordered their generation.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Are we chatting with Pong?

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
No, Wikipedia puts the Atari 2600 in the second generation of games

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
with, I believe, Coleco and some of the ones before it in the first generation.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
So then the first generation would then be like the Odyssey

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
and the Fairchild Channel F?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Oh, boy. Here we go.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Hold on. Here we go.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
I will pull up the article right now.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Well, no.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
I just think that this whole classification is pretty retarded.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
I'm just tired of people commenting on what systems they think are next gen

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
and which systems are not.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
They're all fucking whatever.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
It doesn't matter.

21:34.000 --> 21:40.000
Your comment makes, so you don't own a PS3, so you don't use your 360,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I don't care.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Make your damn game.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Stop chit-chatting.

21:43.000 --> 21:48.000
More worky on Spore.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
You know what?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
It doesn't matter.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I'm actually bringing this up right now,

21:52.000 --> 21:57.000
and it's, yeah, they split this out into the different generations here,

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
and let's see if I can grab the wrap-up here real quick.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
With the generations.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Let's talk more rock.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Sorry.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.000
Okay, yeah, the first generation of games would be from 72 to 77

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
and includes the Magnavox Odyssey, Pong, and the Coleco Telstar.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
Okay.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Are the games in the first generation.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
Then the second generation moves on to the Fairchild Channel F,

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
RCA Studio 2, Atari 2600, Valley Astrocade, the Odyssey,

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
the APF Imagination Machine, the Intellivision, the Atari 5200,

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
Milton Bradley Vectrex, the Emerson Arcadia 2001,

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
ColecoVision, and the Sega SG1000 are all considered in the second generation.

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
The Fairchild Channel F was ass.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.000
And then the video game crash of 1983 separates to the third generation,

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
which is the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Sega Master System,

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
and the Atari 7800.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Then we get into the fourth generation of console games.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
SNES.

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
And the fourth generation of console games includes Turbografx-16,

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
the Sega Genesis, the Neo Geo, and the Super Nintendo.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
And I just closed it, so you'll just have to, you know, fifth generation.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Speculate.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
I don't want to keep reading, but there you go.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Well, hey, how about some other stuff?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Sure.

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
Pop'n Music Bee Mouse, the new Pop'n Music to be coming out.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
It's themed after computer mice, so it's Bee Mouse.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Well, it is a computer mouse.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Wait, it is an actual mouse?

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Yes, it is an actual mouse.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
Take a look at the picture.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
It's awesome.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
It basically folds open, and there's buttons underneath it.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
That's bizarre.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
You really need to check it out.

23:53.000 --> 24:01.000
You can open up the mouse for nine buttons and play a Pop'n Music simulator with a CD.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
That's interesting.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
That's very interesting.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
I've got the list of songs.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
They have a really cool picture of it.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
It's on Konami style.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Definitely worth checking out.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Anything worth noting?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
The song list, I mean.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
There's actually some pretty cool stuff.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
Mr. T, Gradius Full Speed, is on there.

24:23.000 --> 24:28.000
Daikinkai by Desirou Gumi.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
Another lament theme.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Shizuku by Asaki.

24:32.000 --> 24:43.000
We have Megane Rock, Pop'n Music Wan, Giregire Meganidan, Sholakayo Ringoto.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
I can't see the text.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
It's so small.

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
Hachimitsu, Aneta Magiska, Orchestra Featuring Maki.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Yeah, that's what it says.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Lots of stuff.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
There's Shining by Ryo and Noria.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I think this actually is a mouse.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
You can actually use it on your computer.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah, it is.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
But if you take a look at this wonderful picture here, Rob, this is what it looks like.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Oh, good, because I was actually bringing it up right now.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Oh, that is weird.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Huh.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
It's kind of cool, though, I guess.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
So, it's a mouse, and then when you're ready to game, you can do it.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
That's pretty cool.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
That's totally...

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
I'm putting the link in the chatroom so they can see what it looks like.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
Nothing in 2DX mouse.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
2DX mouse would not work, especially for people like me who are right-side players.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
But you could do it, though.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
If you think about it, you could have a scroll wheel on the side of the mouse that would

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
be the scratch.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Yeah.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
That's kind of weird.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Well, you know what they did for the...

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Or hell, just played 2DX with this.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
For the WonderSwan?

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
For BeatMania on WonderSwan?

25:52.000 --> 25:59.000
They had an add-on to it that you could attach a scratch pad onto the controller.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
We should get 2DX DS.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
That would work.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
I think that that would work.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
I stand by what I said in part A about what they really need to do to innovate.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Anyways.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
So other fun stuff, of course.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
There's more firmwares coming out now for the PlayStation 3.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
If you happen to purchase a copy of Ratchet & Clank Future, Tools of Destruction, you

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
got version 1.94, which didn't really do much.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
I think it added some support for the DualShock 3 for that game and then maybe some other

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
shit.

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
But that doesn't matter because apparently firmware 2.0 is supposed to be released on

26:37.000 --> 26:45.000
October 30th and will feature some wonderful stuff including the ability to turn on and

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
off your PS3 using the PSP Remote Play.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I don't see the purpose of that.

26:53.000 --> 27:02.000
A new PlayStation Network category, TV category, who those of you who are in Europe who are

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
installing the Play TV onto your hard drive.

27:05.000 --> 27:14.000
A new playlist for music and photo, a content group for video and game, and apparently there's

27:14.000 --> 27:20.000
the cross-media bar customization including themes and background color settings.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Sort of like what they have with the PSP right now.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
And then the Trend Micro Web Security for PS3 Internet Browser, which is a parental

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
lock for website viewing that will be free for a while and then eventually they will

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
charge you for it.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
Well Ratchet and Clank also has something else very interesting in it, not just a surprise

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
upgrade in anticipation of 2.0.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
But Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of Destruction apparently will actually tie up to the upcoming

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
PSP game, Secret Agent Clank.

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
And this was from a 1UP interview with Insomniac's Creative Director Brian Aligiere.

27:56.000 --> 28:02.000
And apparently he says that the PS3 game and the new PSP game will actually work and connect

28:02.000 --> 28:07.000
to each other in quote, some secret undisclosed way.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
And that's all we know.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Unfortunately we don't know what it is.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
Like do you unlock some like old Ratchet and Clank game with it?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Like a Metroid hookup type thing?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Unfortunately we don't know.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
But we do know that the game will not connect up with other services.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.000
Tools of Destruction will not connect to home or any other PlayStation game or PSP game.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
Just the other Ratchet and Clank game that is coming out, Secret Agent Clank.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
So look for it.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I'd be curious to know what that connectivity is.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
I hope it's something new and exciting and not something we've kind of seen before.

28:38.000 --> 28:49.000
Well, for anyone who is playing Motorstorm, there is a, looks like a patch to the game.

28:49.000 --> 28:57.000
Yeah, that will actually, supposed to add vibration support for the DualShock 3 controller.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
Grid order randomized for the first race in any online lobby.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
Finishing positions for your last race to determine your starting grid position in the next race

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
within the same online lobby.

29:09.000 --> 29:16.000
Screen indicator is added to show whether voice comms are issuing from TV or headset.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
Sensitivity for 6-axis motion sensor.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Gloating index, that's kind of weird.

29:23.000 --> 29:31.000
It gives you an idea of how well another racer is performed.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
I do like how it seems like quite a few Sony games are doing this.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
I like how these games kind of keep patching themselves to get a little better.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
I think that's kind of cool.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
I think I see that you kind of seem, it feels like I'm seeing that happen more on the Sony games than on 360 games.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
Usually the 360 games get patched to fix something that broke, not often to add completely new stuff.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
And that makes it feel a little more like, well, let's say World of Warcraft constantly patches itself,

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
and a lot of MMOs do this, patch itself with brand new stuff.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
So, it's kind of interesting.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Kind of nice.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
It makes you feel like you're getting a little more money for, you know, considering PS3 stuff is a lot of money.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
It makes you feel like, you know, you're getting a little more for your money.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
That's cool.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
Right?

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
I mean, it's better than them releasing us download content and making us pay for it.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
Seriously.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Of course, I wouldn't put that past you.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
I don't know.

30:14.000 --> 30:21.000
If I remember back to playing Final Fantasy XI, I didn't particularly like downloading the updates.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Yeah, it kind of sucks when everybody was hitting it at once.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
But World of Warcraft does it kind of smart now.

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
Right before a major patch will come out, a couple days or maybe even a week before,

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
they'll actually put a thing similar to BitTorrent that will automatically run when you launch WoW,

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
so it slowly downloads the patch as you're playing.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
And so that way when it's time for the patch to go live, then it'll send a pulse that says,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
okay, time to update the game with the patch.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
And so everybody already has it downloaded.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
It's kind of cool.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
That's pretty smart.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I like the way they do it on WoW.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
And I want 2.3 already because I want my arena season one gear without having to work for it.

30:55.000 --> 31:03.000
Although I still kind of like how they do it in Ragnarok where they do small patches every time.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
And so it makes sure that your patches are all up to date right when you start the game.

31:07.000 --> 31:13.000
That's kind of how Guild Wars worked too, wasn't it?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
A little bit?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
I think so.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
It's just little bits at a time.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Yeah.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Cool.

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
Anyways, let's see here.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
Interesting news.

31:26.000 --> 31:32.000
Well, I wouldn't exactly call this news because I've been talking about how stupid easy it's going to be

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
to copy the damn cards for Eye of Judgment.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
But apparently it's even easier than you may have thought.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
The game has absolutely no copy protection whatsoever.

31:42.000 --> 31:50.000
In fact, you can pretty much draw symbols on a piece of paper using the felt tip marker and it will work.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
That's really sad.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
But yeah, it's very easy to copy them.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
The game has no problem reading, you know, printed out copies of the cards.

32:02.000 --> 32:07.000
Or just if you happen to scribble in the symbols that they have on the cards, it will work as well.

32:07.000 --> 32:11.000
So basically with a box of Crayolas, I could recreate the cards.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Yes.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
Wow.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Yes, you could.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
That's kind of sad.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
It is sad.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
You know what?

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
I'm just curious what the chat room has to say for this.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
I will remind...

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
I've been having live stream problems.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
Dark Tetsuya is giving a big XD to Crayola.

32:28.000 --> 32:38.000
I will remind you though that in case you don't want to copy the cards, the theme packs are available for $15 each or $4 per booster pack.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
I swear I didn't use a Crayon reference on purpose.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
I swear.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Oh my God.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.000
That's funny.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Anyhow, what's that?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Oh, the fake cards?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
Yeah.

32:47.000 --> 32:53.000
Anyhow, you know, this means we got lied to about the whole copy protection thing and I don't like getting lied to.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
We all knew this was coming.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
We all knew this was going to happen and this makes us very angsty.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
So you know we have to bring on the FUs of the week.

33:00.000 --> 33:13.000
And back by popular demand, folks.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
FU to this music?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I'm fucking sick of it.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Done.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Sorry, we got emails.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
They missed it.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Don't care.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
Don't care.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
Don't care.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
We'll see.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
FU to women for not being able to make up their mind on certain things.

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
For example, say for, you know, you're asking your wife what they want to eat for dinner.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
And they're like, I don't know.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
So you start suggesting things.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
And they're like, no, I don't want to do that.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
No, I don't want to do that.

33:41.000 --> 33:48.000
We'll fucking suggest something then if you're just going to deny every one of my suggestions and fucking come up with your own.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
I hate it.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
And it's not about everything.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Women do this about all sorts of categories.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I'm going to give you a hint.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Just do whatever you want.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
I do.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
And they complain.

33:59.000 --> 34:05.000
So there's no winning that argument.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
That's it.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
All right.

34:08.000 --> 34:14.000
My FU of the week goes to my injury because it sucks.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
And I don't like having a sore thigh thing.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
It makes it hard to sit down.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
People go, you can't sit down.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Being injured sucks.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I had a real FU, actually.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Oh, yes.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
What is that?

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
This stupid music pushed it out of my head.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
I don't even know if I have the other music queued up.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Hold on.

34:33.000 --> 34:39.000
Let's see if we can do shuffling, shuffling, shuffling.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
This is wonderful.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Radio us.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
I dig through the computer.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Don't worry about it.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Hold on.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
I'm in the right folder.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
I just need the right file name.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
And here we go.

34:50.000 --> 34:57.000
Much better.

34:57.000 --> 35:06.000
Anyway.

35:06.000 --> 35:15.000
So my actual FU goes towards, I don't really want to say towards my husband because I really,

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
really, really do love my husband.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
But he can be freaking infuriating sometimes.

35:23.000 --> 35:37.000
And I know that he has good intentions, but don't try to have a logical discussion with

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
me when I haven't eaten anything in like 12 hours.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
It doesn't work.

35:43.000 --> 35:49.000
And don't be pushy about it either.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
The end.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
All right.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
Sorry, I was putting away the webcam because our Op11 time ran up.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Why are people pushy?

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
I don't know.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
You shouldn't be pushy.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
You should be pulley.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
All right.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
Let's get back into some gaming news because then we'll be pushing the listeners to call

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
in on our Skype line.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Oh, God.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Our username on Skype.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
We have a few more stories, a handful of stories for you guys before we get there.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
And the first one has to do with GameStop.

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
GameStop, they have EB, and it seems like they're taking over the world when it comes

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
to mall video game stores.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.000
And they just might be because they just opened up.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
This place isn't that far from us, actually.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Jackson, California.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
That's not that far from here.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
Just probably about 30 miles from here.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
They opened up their 5,000th store, GameStop did.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
The 5,000th GameStop store.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
What GameStop?

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
Well, to put that in perspective, and a lot of people feel that way, which is why this

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
news may be good news for some and bad news for others.

36:46.000 --> 36:53.000
To put it in perspective, Starbucks has 12,000 plus locations, but I wonder if that counts

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
like the ones in the grocery store.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
I don't know.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
And McDonald's, get this, has 31,000 restaurants.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
But still, to think that for every six McDonald's there's one GameStop, I mean, there's a lot

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
of freaking McDonald's, right?

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Like every exit on the freeway has a McDonald's, right?

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
So, kind of interesting that for every six of those there's still one GameStop.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Interesting.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Very interesting.

37:15.000 --> 37:23.000
Well, you know what else is interesting is that people are still making Dreamcast games.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
And the rest of the world goes, why?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
But I love the Dreamcast.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
The Dreamcast is like the best system ever.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
So Dark Sakura says, because.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Yep.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
Except, why this retarded game?

37:36.000 --> 37:42.560
The Alice Company is bringing out Dynamite Dreams, which is pretty much a Bomberman ripoff

37:42.560 --> 37:47.000
that was based off of a minigame in Alice Dreams that they were working on.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
So, whatever.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
Bring me a good game, please.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I'll work on doing that right now.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
The Dreamcast was so awesome.

37:55.000 --> 38:01.000
Anyways, it's a little bit of fun here.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
Well, I don't know if this is fun, but the place where every website goes, or where the

38:06.000 --> 38:10.500
internet goes to die, is now going to be the place where games go to die, because MySpace

38:10.500 --> 38:14.800
is launching their casual games channel in 2008.

38:14.800 --> 38:21.120
And you'll be able to put crappy Flash games into your web page.

38:21.120 --> 38:24.320
So I can destroy my profile with all those buildings.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.320
Some people do that already.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.960
I think people on MySpace have seen it.

38:27.960 --> 38:32.000
I think a coworker of mine has Pac-Man on their profile, like a little mini Pac-Man

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
game.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
It's not real Pac-Man.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.360
It's some cheap knockoff, but oh boy.

38:37.360 --> 38:41.200
Could that be interesting, though, if they had leaderboards all tied together and you

38:41.200 --> 38:43.840
could see how you compare on these casual games to your friends?

38:43.840 --> 38:46.000
I mean, a little silly fun.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.880
This actually might not be such a bad thing if done right, but I don't know.

38:48.880 --> 38:52.960
I fear that if you let users put these on their profiles, it's just going to make bad

38:52.960 --> 38:54.800
profiles even uglier.

38:54.800 --> 38:55.800
Yeah.

38:55.800 --> 39:01.000
But at least on MySpace, if your profile is ugly, it's your own damn fault, right?

39:01.000 --> 39:04.940
I had somebody make mine, but mine was pretty.

39:04.940 --> 39:07.680
You still had the final approval, and you looked at it and you go, yeah.

39:07.680 --> 39:08.680
Like seriously, I look at some of...

39:08.680 --> 39:10.320
I helped design the graphics on it, too.

39:10.320 --> 39:14.720
Well, I look at some of my friends' MySpaces and I go, do you even look at your own page?

39:14.720 --> 39:15.880
Like it's hideous.

39:15.880 --> 39:18.480
You have to scroll down forever to see anything.

39:18.480 --> 39:21.000
Like who's actually going to look at this?

39:21.000 --> 39:25.680
I actually scaled my MySpace page back a little while ago, A, so I can make it public, and

39:25.680 --> 39:29.720
B, because it's public again, and B, so I could, you know, just not have to scroll so

39:29.720 --> 39:34.240
much because of all the stupid pictures I had on it.

39:34.240 --> 39:38.840
BlackLavinarChatroom says, MySpace is garbage, but don't you have a MySpace?

39:38.840 --> 39:39.840
Hm.

39:39.840 --> 39:43.200
GS68 says, you do not say the MS word.

39:43.200 --> 39:44.200
Microsoft?

39:44.200 --> 39:46.200
Oh, MySpace.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.200
Someone left a...

39:47.200 --> 39:51.920
I was just checking my MySpace now to see what was on it, and Neki left the best joke

39:51.920 --> 39:52.920
ever.

39:52.920 --> 39:53.920
What's that?

39:53.920 --> 39:57.560
What do people go that's bigger on the inside than the out, and it's their retardus?

39:57.560 --> 39:58.560
What?

39:58.560 --> 39:59.560
That's awful.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.560
Oh, retardus.

40:00.560 --> 40:01.560
I get it.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.560
Wow.

40:02.560 --> 40:03.560
Bad Dr. Who joke.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.560
That is a very bad joke in many different color forms.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.560
But it made me laugh.

40:07.560 --> 40:08.560
All right.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.760
Anyhow, maybe our listeners want to tell some jokes tonight.

40:11.760 --> 40:16.680
We're going to take some calls right now, www.OrangeLarmsRadio.com, click on interact

40:16.680 --> 40:20.400
with us for all the details, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number if you want to pick up the phone

40:20.400 --> 40:21.400
and call.

40:21.400 --> 40:24.520
Have your mommy or daddy's permission because it's only toll free in the US and Canada.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.680
Or you can call us on Skype.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.680
That's free for everyone.

40:26.680 --> 40:30.520
Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.

40:30.520 --> 40:33.960
Looking at some other quick comments on chat while we wait for some calls because of the

40:33.960 --> 40:34.960
delay.

40:34.960 --> 40:39.700
Escapist in our chat room says, in regards to Facebook, here we go again with the MySpace

40:39.700 --> 40:43.040
versus Facebook thing, just try to lick me in real life.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.680
I dare you.

40:45.680 --> 40:49.720
I'm sure that's from one of those, you just got a lick, or you just got poked by so and

40:49.720 --> 40:50.720
so.

40:50.720 --> 40:52.960
I don't want to go back to my annoyance with Facebook.

40:52.960 --> 40:58.440
I actually tried to add, I went back and added some friends because some OLR people added

40:58.440 --> 40:59.440
me on Facebook.

40:59.440 --> 41:03.600
I guess amongst all my rants on the show recently, folks figured out I had an account.

41:03.600 --> 41:08.760
So all right, let's head on over to the phones and we'll take a call.

41:08.760 --> 41:12.120
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

41:12.120 --> 41:13.120
It's Legend of Zaku.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.560
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

41:14.560 --> 41:15.560
What's on your mind?

41:15.560 --> 41:23.960
Nah, just going through the usual Sunday routine, just getting playing Crysis and stuff like

41:23.960 --> 41:26.160
that demo.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.160
Listening to our show.

41:27.160 --> 41:28.640
Are you doing both at the same time?

41:28.640 --> 41:33.120
Well, if I could, now that I have a new PC to do it on.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.120
Nice.

41:34.120 --> 41:35.120
So what's on your mind?

41:35.120 --> 41:36.120
What do you want to tell us about?

41:36.120 --> 41:41.840
I don't know, the fact that Crysis is just, you know, it's not for the faint of heart,

41:41.840 --> 41:43.360
graphics-wise and system-wise.

41:43.360 --> 41:49.840
Obviously, you're going to need a really beefy PC to get through it.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.840
But also, I think...

41:50.840 --> 41:52.840
But is it a good game?

41:52.840 --> 41:53.840
Huh?

41:53.840 --> 41:55.140
Is it a good game?

41:55.140 --> 41:56.140
So far it is.

41:56.140 --> 42:01.160
I mean, it's kind of like Half-Life 2 and Far Cry had a love child.

42:01.160 --> 42:02.160
Okay.

42:02.160 --> 42:03.160
All right.

42:03.160 --> 42:11.960
I mean, yeah, so far it's running pretty good for a new system that I built so far.

42:11.960 --> 42:16.120
But you know, hopefully when it launches, it'll probably be optimized and ready for

42:16.120 --> 42:17.120
use.

42:17.120 --> 42:22.960
It was a little laggy from what I hear from other folks with other more powerful systems

42:22.960 --> 42:23.960
than mine.

42:23.960 --> 42:24.960
All right.

42:24.960 --> 42:25.960
Very cool.

42:25.960 --> 42:26.960
Mm-hmm.

42:26.960 --> 42:30.480
Well, anything else you've been playing lately besides Crysis?

42:30.480 --> 42:36.360
Just Quake Wars, another game that came with my video card, Enemy Territory Quake Wars.

42:36.360 --> 42:37.360
And how's that?

42:37.360 --> 42:38.360
It's all right.

42:38.360 --> 42:42.040
I mean, it's kind of like Battlefield and the Quake Wars world.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.880
You mean the Quake world?

42:44.880 --> 42:45.880
Quake we own.

42:45.880 --> 42:46.880
Quake needs...

42:46.880 --> 42:48.480
You know, because Quake 4 wasn't all that great.

42:48.480 --> 42:52.840
So Quake needs some good games that make me remember how much the first game was awesome.

42:52.840 --> 42:56.560
We need Enemy Territory Duke Nukem.

42:56.560 --> 42:57.560
That's what we need.

42:57.560 --> 42:58.760
Maybe after Duke Nukem Forever.

42:58.760 --> 43:01.400
Wasn't that supposed to come out at the end of the year?

43:01.400 --> 43:02.400
Oh, fucking hell.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.840
Wasn't one of those, hey, it finally got a release date and it's like...

43:04.840 --> 43:06.240
No, it never got a release date.

43:06.240 --> 43:08.520
That'd be all over the internet, Vann.

43:08.520 --> 43:09.680
Yes, that's true.

43:09.680 --> 43:17.520
And also, I think I heard of another Xbox Live horror story where this one guy, he got,

43:17.520 --> 43:23.240
you know, he sent his console to get it repaired.

43:23.240 --> 43:28.800
And then when he got the new one back, they couldn't even transfer like, you know, $320

43:28.800 --> 43:32.960
worth of Microsoft points because they're not transferable.

43:32.960 --> 43:34.160
Right.

43:34.160 --> 43:35.760
Can't you call Microsoft and get that fixed?

43:35.760 --> 43:40.880
No, that's a, that's a, that's apparently, unfortunately that's a policy that they have.

43:40.880 --> 43:41.880
Well, here's the thing.

43:41.880 --> 43:47.120
You don't need to transfer the points because that's, your live account is on their server.

43:47.120 --> 43:48.120
It's not on the 360.

43:48.120 --> 43:49.800
All you got to do is re...

43:49.800 --> 43:54.880
They told him was that the points were actually tied to the console.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.380
No, they're not.

43:56.380 --> 43:59.800
It's from what I recall, it's a little bit of both is that you download the game and

43:59.800 --> 44:00.800
that's tied to your account.

44:00.800 --> 44:05.480
But here's the thing, like, let's say, like, let's say me and you are playing, let's say

44:05.480 --> 44:09.240
we're roommates again, Loki, back in the day and we have one 360 in the house.

44:09.240 --> 44:13.320
If I paid for the game and I downloaded it, you get to play the full version on the console.

44:13.320 --> 44:14.900
But here's the thing.

44:14.900 --> 44:20.600
If we get a new console or whatever and I sign in and download the game, you can't play

44:20.600 --> 44:21.600
it.

44:21.600 --> 44:22.960
You still get the trial version.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.120
Okay.

44:24.120 --> 44:25.880
That's still, that doesn't matter though.

44:25.880 --> 44:31.480
That's the thing is that his games that he purchased should be able to be transferred

44:31.480 --> 44:35.400
over because he can just redownload them again and he still has the full rights to

44:35.400 --> 44:40.880
them because it has, you know, on record that he's paid for it and also if he has any Microsoft

44:40.880 --> 44:44.660
points because you can purchase those points through like independent websites and stuff

44:44.660 --> 44:45.660
and add them on there.

44:45.660 --> 44:49.540
Like for example, if you're buying stuff for your Zune, your Microsoft account or whatever

44:49.540 --> 44:51.120
still tied to all that stuff.

44:51.120 --> 44:55.840
So you can port it over even if you buy a new 360.

44:55.840 --> 44:57.000
They have the ability to do that.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
I've done that.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
I have a story right now.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
I don't know where.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
I know I saw it on.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.760
Well, that's the story and you stick into it.

45:03.760 --> 45:04.760
All right.

45:04.760 --> 45:07.240
Well, Zach, we got to let you go to get some more calls real quick.

45:07.240 --> 45:09.240
Last final thought for everybody.

45:09.240 --> 45:17.680
Um, just, um, I don't know, just, you know, you know, just get a better computer.

45:17.680 --> 45:18.680
All right.

45:18.680 --> 45:19.680
Get it.

45:19.680 --> 45:20.680
You might need one.

45:20.680 --> 45:21.680
Everybody get a better computer.

45:21.680 --> 45:22.680
All right.

45:22.680 --> 45:23.680
Thanks Zach.

45:23.680 --> 45:24.680
You have a good one, buddy.

45:24.680 --> 45:25.680
All right.

45:25.680 --> 45:26.680
Good.

45:26.680 --> 45:27.680
Bye bye.

45:27.680 --> 45:28.680
Did you hear that?

45:28.680 --> 45:29.680
Everybody, you need to get a better computer.

45:29.680 --> 45:30.680
Loki, get a better computer.

45:30.680 --> 45:32.400
I did need a computer.

45:32.400 --> 45:34.920
My computer, the hard drive or something's crapping out on it.

45:34.920 --> 45:38.520
I actually want to get this fucking fan on this thing is so I wonder if I could like

45:38.520 --> 45:39.520
hold the microphone.

45:39.520 --> 45:42.360
You could hear it.

45:42.360 --> 45:43.840
The fan on this thing is so loud.

45:43.840 --> 45:45.480
You can hear it throughout the whole house.

45:45.480 --> 45:46.480
It's crazy.

45:46.480 --> 45:47.480
Hi.

45:47.480 --> 45:48.480
You're on orange launch radio.

45:48.480 --> 45:49.480
Who's this?

45:49.480 --> 45:50.480
Hi.

45:50.480 --> 45:53.200
You're on orange launch radio.

45:53.200 --> 45:54.200
Who's this?

45:54.200 --> 45:56.600
This would be the dark knight himself.

45:56.600 --> 45:57.600
There you are, sir.

45:57.600 --> 45:58.920
You're a little bit quiet, but that's all right.

45:58.920 --> 46:00.060
We'll fix that.

46:00.060 --> 46:01.060
How are you doing?

46:01.060 --> 46:02.920
How are you doing, dark knight?

46:02.920 --> 46:03.920
Yeah.

46:03.920 --> 46:04.920
How you doing?

46:04.920 --> 46:05.920
Good.

46:05.920 --> 46:06.920
How are you?

46:06.920 --> 46:11.920
A little bit happier now that I have my 360.

46:11.920 --> 46:14.240
I noticed that you've actually been signing into live.

46:14.240 --> 46:17.520
I was playing Guitar Hero 3 earlier today and I saw you sign on and I was kind of like,

46:17.520 --> 46:18.520
wait a minute.

46:18.520 --> 46:21.800
I thought he only had an Xbox.com account, but not a live, so now you're actually on

46:21.800 --> 46:25.120
Xbox Live and all that.

46:25.120 --> 46:26.120
Yeah.

46:26.120 --> 46:27.120
Yeah.

46:27.120 --> 46:31.040
So, what kind of games have you been playing?

46:31.040 --> 46:36.120
Forza 2 and Man of 97, Man of 07, I'm sorry.

46:36.120 --> 46:39.880
But yeah, if you were playing Man of 97 on Xbox, that would be something, though.

46:39.880 --> 46:43.160
That means you had to cram that cartridge into some slot.

46:43.160 --> 46:46.000
Xbox Live Arcade or something like that.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Very cool.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
So, what's it like being all brand new to the Xbox now?

46:51.000 --> 46:54.080
I mean, does it seem like there's a lot out there the Xbox has to offer?

46:54.080 --> 46:56.440
I guess let me back up and rephrase it this way.

46:56.440 --> 46:59.680
What made you finally decide to take the plunge after all this time and jump in and get a

46:59.680 --> 47:00.680
360?

47:00.680 --> 47:04.360
Part of it is because I didn't want to fall behind.

47:04.360 --> 47:09.280
The other part was that since I do my own show, I want to kind of keep up to date with

47:09.280 --> 47:11.560
it and everything like that.

47:11.560 --> 47:12.880
That's understandable.

47:12.880 --> 47:16.680
Sometimes I buy games just so I can talk about them here or what have you.

47:16.680 --> 47:21.200
It's probably kind of dangerous, but I like to be informed, so shoot me.

47:21.200 --> 47:24.240
Okay, so that's cool to see you finally took the plunge.

47:24.240 --> 47:26.320
For the betterment of your own program as well as the internet.

47:26.320 --> 47:27.440
For the greater good.

47:27.440 --> 47:28.440
That's right.

47:28.440 --> 47:29.440
Of all mankind.

47:29.440 --> 47:30.440
Yes.

47:30.440 --> 47:31.440
That's very cool.

47:31.440 --> 47:37.040
It's kind of funny though because everybody talked about you should play it on high definition

47:37.040 --> 47:38.040
TV and whatnot.

47:38.040 --> 47:48.040
I admit I don't have one, but in due fairness, it looks just as good on a regular TV.

47:48.040 --> 47:51.640
That's an excellent point is that sometimes we talk about all these graphics and the HD

47:51.640 --> 47:55.440
TVs and everything and we forget, you know what, not everybody can just afford to run

47:55.440 --> 47:57.700
out and go buy an HD TV.

47:57.700 --> 47:59.920
They're still kind of pricey.

47:59.920 --> 48:05.200
Do you think amongst your gaming experience, does Microsoft do a pretty good job of still

48:05.200 --> 48:08.840
keeping the love for the folks that are stuck with standard definition for now?

48:08.840 --> 48:12.400
Yeah, I mean, it's not really that bad at all.

48:12.400 --> 48:17.240
Like I said, I'm playing Madden 07 and it looks just as good as on HD.

48:17.240 --> 48:22.360
The only difference is I don't have that total clearness and HD would have it, but it does

48:22.360 --> 48:24.320
do it justice.

48:24.320 --> 48:27.560
Do most of the standard definitions games letterbox?

48:27.560 --> 48:36.680
No, because basically it picks it up as a 480p TV.

48:36.680 --> 48:38.480
Some games letterbox themselves though, right?

48:38.480 --> 48:41.640
Didn't Final Fantasy XI automatically letterbox even if you were on a standard TV?

48:41.640 --> 48:47.000
Well, it depends on the game because you have to set your console to, you can set it so

48:47.000 --> 48:52.480
that your TV is a 4 by 3 aspect ratio and then if the game wants to letterbox it will,

48:52.480 --> 48:58.360
otherwise it may just do full screen.

48:58.360 --> 49:08.320
Well, Dark Knight, what would you say you're looking forward to most on the 360 now that

49:08.320 --> 49:11.560
you're an owner?

49:11.560 --> 49:14.640
Just messing around with it right now and just getting used to it.

49:14.640 --> 49:24.080
So far I've downloaded some Xbox Live games and whatnot, I've downloaded Final Fantasy

49:24.080 --> 49:25.360
Special and whatnot.

49:25.360 --> 49:26.760
I can't get my words out tonight.

49:26.760 --> 49:27.760
Very cool.

49:27.760 --> 49:28.760
No, that's alright.

49:28.760 --> 49:33.440
If you think about it, they're almost up to 100 of those games pretty soon.

49:33.440 --> 49:37.620
For those of us who have been on Xbox Live a while, it seems like alright, we just kind

49:37.620 --> 49:40.840
of wait for each week to see what they're going to release to see if it's worth buying.

49:40.840 --> 49:44.040
But man, to be jumping in on that now and then you dip into the archive like, oh my

49:44.040 --> 49:47.120
God, there's like 100 games to pick from, tons of stuff.

49:47.120 --> 49:48.120
Exactly.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.120
That's got to be crazy.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.120
That's what my reaction was when I saw it.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.120
I was like, dude, that's a long list.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.120
Yeah, it keeps growing.

49:52.120 --> 49:54.120
Sometimes the rest of us take it for granted.

49:54.120 --> 49:57.200
Well, Dark Knight, we have to let you go so we can get to some more calls, but thank you

49:57.200 --> 49:59.440
very much and enjoy the Xbox.

49:59.440 --> 50:03.440
I hope your Xbox experiences Red Rings of Death free.

50:03.440 --> 50:09.640
Well, lo and behold, my system is like a late system.

50:09.640 --> 50:13.240
I think it was dated July 22nd of 07, so it's recent.

50:13.240 --> 50:14.240
Oh, good.

50:14.240 --> 50:15.240
Good.

50:15.240 --> 50:16.240
Then I hope it's Red Rings free.

50:16.240 --> 50:17.240
Alright.

50:17.240 --> 50:18.240
We'll be pulling for you, buddy.

50:18.240 --> 50:19.240
Alright.

50:19.240 --> 50:20.240
You have a good one.

50:20.240 --> 50:21.240
See you.

50:21.240 --> 50:22.240
You too.

50:22.240 --> 50:23.240
Bye.

50:23.240 --> 50:24.240
Bye.

50:24.240 --> 50:25.240
Bye.

50:25.240 --> 50:28.640
If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

50:28.640 --> 50:30.640
Let's see if we can squeeze in some out.

50:30.640 --> 50:31.640
We're already getting a call.

50:31.640 --> 50:32.640
Here we go.

50:32.640 --> 50:33.640
Hi.

50:33.640 --> 50:34.640
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

50:34.640 --> 50:35.640
Who's this?

50:35.640 --> 50:36.640
Yo, it's Xenocore.

50:36.640 --> 50:37.640
How y'all doing?

50:37.640 --> 50:38.640
Good.

50:38.640 --> 50:39.640
How are you, Xenocore?

50:39.640 --> 50:40.640
Yeah, I'm living.

50:40.640 --> 50:41.640
I'm living.

50:41.640 --> 50:42.640
You know how things go.

50:42.640 --> 50:43.640
How are we?

50:43.640 --> 50:47.080
Even with minor injuries and whatever else is going on in our personal lives, we're making

50:47.080 --> 50:48.120
it to another week.

50:48.120 --> 50:49.580
What's on your mind?

50:49.580 --> 50:52.200
Not too much.

50:52.200 --> 50:57.480
Just heard you guys referencing some of the old school stuff that I call in.

50:57.480 --> 50:59.980
Dark Soccer was talking about Ragnarok II.

50:59.980 --> 51:05.880
I touched something that looks like it was made in the same engine called Pirate King

51:05.880 --> 51:06.880
Online.

51:06.880 --> 51:08.420
It looks like it's done in the Ragnarok.

51:08.420 --> 51:09.420
In the Ragnarok.

51:09.420 --> 51:10.420
It's too damn cute.

51:10.420 --> 51:12.240
I couldn't play it for more than an hour.

51:12.240 --> 51:14.240
play pirate king online

51:14.240 --> 51:16.200
It was all right

51:16.200 --> 51:21.200
Yeah, I got that feeling. I'm gonna farm that off the farm that off the show. I couldn't review it well

51:21.200 --> 51:25.560
Where did you know what he's a weird like echoing with you? I don't know what that is

51:25.560 --> 51:30.360
I just want to let those people who's listening on their iPods and stuff know if you're hearing him repeat things

51:30.360 --> 51:35.940
That's not that's not you guys. It's it's some something weird with the call actually it is you guys you just

51:36.480 --> 51:39.560
Can't hear correctly. I don't know what that is. That's an error

51:39.560 --> 51:45.200
I've not seen before but anyway, so so pirate king was okay was Ragnarok is a ton more fun. Okay?

51:48.120 --> 51:49.920
That one and

51:49.920 --> 51:55.500
All different odds and ends here and there managed to get some more points on ER kung fu and Xbox Live

51:55.500 --> 52:00.960
But that's pretty much the only noteworthy thing. I've been doing lately. So hey yar kung fu is a pretty fun little game

52:00.960 --> 52:02.960
It's it's often overlooked

52:03.080 --> 52:07.440
But you know because you know fighting games have evolved so damn much since then but you know

52:07.440 --> 52:10.200
You gotta respect the elders too. I know you play a lot of RPGs

52:10.200 --> 52:15.220
What other kind of like obscure MMOs maybe because you know, everybody always talks about your Warcraft Warcraft Warcraft

52:15.440 --> 52:19.200
What are the types of MMOs and and just maybe other role-playing games in general?

52:19.200 --> 52:22.840
Should we be looking out for that? Maybe the mainstream media doesn't pay enough attention to

52:23.560 --> 52:27.680
Well, there is one free one. I reviewed in the past called Bounty Bay online

52:27.680 --> 52:31.400
That really looks good and it is free at the moment. Nice

52:32.120 --> 52:37.000
It's a pirate simulator. It plays like pirates does but it's an MMO environment

52:37.000 --> 52:42.040
So it's pretty neat. Wow. We really do have a lot of pirates MMOs cuz then Disney put out an official one

52:42.040 --> 52:45.280
I'm thinking well, of course, uh, there's but there's puzzle pirates, too

52:45.280 --> 52:50.800
And it's kind of all probably thanks to Johnny Depp, but I don't know you'd like to think probably yes

52:50.800 --> 52:55.860
I'm gonna do that. But where are my ninja MMOs? That's the ultimate question. We have all these pirate MMOs

52:55.940 --> 53:01.380
Where is my ninja MMO whether it be Ninja Gaiden or last ninja? I don't know just a ninja MMO

53:02.080 --> 53:04.200
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Damn. Skippy, man

53:04.200 --> 53:07.520
We need to take our idea and patent it. There it is

53:07.520 --> 53:13.360
I I now own the patents and trademarks on a ninja MMO watch me get see somebody probably made one

53:13.360 --> 53:15.360
I just don't know of it. So

53:15.920 --> 53:18.940
Well seen according to these guys anything else you want to share with our listeners?

53:19.960 --> 53:24.480
That's pretty much it. Yeah, I'm still waiting for rock band and guitar hero 3 to come out

53:24.480 --> 53:30.400
We'll see how they do upon release guitar instruments guitar hero 3 was out yesterday. Oh, yeah, that's true

53:30.400 --> 53:35.520
That's true. But rock bands the one I'm looking for, but I'm waiting for the for the peripherals to start coming by themselves

53:35.520 --> 53:38.120
I don't have that many homies around me to buy the whole set

53:38.120 --> 53:42.400
Yeah, that's too much money for the whole set and unfortunately the peripherals by themselves

53:42.400 --> 53:44.080
You're gonna be going into oh wait

53:44.080 --> 53:48.480
But I'm probably gonna pick up the game because I have the guitar hero 2 controller which will work with rock band

53:48.480 --> 53:53.660
So at least I'll have guitar and you know, if if my microphone works for Xbox Live

53:53.660 --> 53:58.300
They'll have a microphone if it doesn't that it doesn't I didn't nobody on Xbox Live music or buying anyway

53:58.300 --> 54:02.020
They don't need to hear me sing. I'm buying you're gonna buy the whole bundle. Yeah sucker

54:02.020 --> 54:06.360
I know cuz I hate playing guitar here and I don't know why the fuck I keep buying this shit

54:06.360 --> 54:08.360
I'm getting the bundle because

54:08.540 --> 54:13.000
You guys are made of money. All right, I'm not made of money. It's worth it. If you're gonna get anything

54:16.420 --> 54:22.700
I've cut down on my buying of 360 games, so I don't really worry about you know, I'm saving up. All right

54:23.700 --> 54:27.580
You can buy you can spend your money. However, you want. I'm just saying 170 bucks. That's a lot of money

54:27.580 --> 54:29.580
Oh, that's a lot of not

54:29.980 --> 54:37.860
Really? Cuz I mean if if I don't you know go out for lunch during my work week then after you know

54:37.860 --> 54:42.600
A few weeks that's enough to pay for the game. Hmm. Then again next month is gonna be slim for me anyway

54:43.300 --> 54:44.540
All right

54:44.540 --> 54:49.340
Well Zina court we got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but any of any other quick last comments

54:50.020 --> 54:55.060
Yeah, that's pretty much it guys. I'll talk to you guys later. All right. Take care Zina court. Bye. Bye

54:55.060 --> 55:00.820
I think it's the first time he's been on the program. Actually, I don't remember him calling him before maybe he did once

55:01.180 --> 55:04.960
But appreciate always hearing from the people we don't often hear from but we also

55:05.500 --> 55:10.540
Appreciate hearing from the people we do often hear from which I believe is our next call. Hello. You're on Orange launch radio

55:11.180 --> 55:14.460
Hey, it's run. What's up, everyone? What I tell ya. Hi everyone

55:17.460 --> 55:20.540
No, I just said because the last caller was someone we don't hear from a lot

55:20.580 --> 55:23.860
But now we're hearing from someone we do hear from a lot, but that's alright. What's up?

55:23.860 --> 55:27.980
Not much not much. Oh and sky. I know you're pro ninja

55:27.980 --> 55:32.900
I'm only try to send you a ninjas versus pirate shirt where ninjas win four to three. All right

55:33.540 --> 55:34.900
Sounds yes

55:34.900 --> 55:41.300
Definitely, but I don't hate pirates like usually, you know in the ninja versus pirate or you have to love one and hate the others

55:41.300 --> 55:47.040
I don't hate pirates. I respect pirates, but they're just you know, they're just inferior to ninjas

55:47.780 --> 55:53.260
Plus ninjas are cooler. That's right. Yeah. Anyway, sorry. Yeah, what'd you want to call us talk about tonight?

55:53.260 --> 55:58.140
Surely it wasn't pirates versus ninjas. Oh, no, I got a couple of game reviews for you. What games?

55:59.140 --> 56:04.300
Puzzle quest for the DS and the Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass. All right, let's start with puzzle quest for the DS

56:04.300 --> 56:06.300
Cuz it's the older game. What do you think?

56:07.260 --> 56:12.300
Honestly, I should have waited till the game dropped to 1999. Oh snap. Not a big fan, huh?

56:12.780 --> 56:18.260
Yeah, I am a big fan of bejeweled and a friend of mine bought it and I not really know too much about it

56:18.260 --> 56:19.820
She said it's just like bejeweled

56:19.820 --> 56:23.460
I'm like, really went out like a couple of weeks later and I bought it

56:23.460 --> 56:29.900
I mean, I like the puzzle aspect the puzzle RPG element of it, but it's just that when you're looking at the game

56:30.100 --> 56:33.940
It's like you're not sure where to begin. Do you want to build up your gold?

56:34.180 --> 56:37.260
Do you want to start fighting the creature build up your experience?

56:37.260 --> 56:42.220
And you just gotta be very careful in the patterns that you move because you make the wrong move

56:42.220 --> 56:47.500
That your applause gonna hit like a five six chain combo then you're like rarely screwed

56:47.500 --> 56:52.380
That's kind of what I like about it though, because it isn't bejeweled. I mean it isn't it isn't

56:52.380 --> 56:58.740
I mean just adding that one small little change really kind of changes the whole the whole way you think about the game

56:59.100 --> 57:02.740
Well, you don't want to set up really elaborate combos and bejeweled

57:02.780 --> 57:06.940
It's all about let me make a move that will set up my next move to be really cool

57:07.100 --> 57:10.280
But now in puzzle quest you got to go what's a cool move I can do right now

57:10.580 --> 57:17.140
That's not gonna screw me in the next turn. I know I mean like each battle takes me about 10 to 15 minutes

57:17.140 --> 57:21.980
I'm sitting here like scrutinizing the board if I do this, I start do that. I'll see myself doing

57:22.580 --> 57:25.740
Two three moves in advance what's gonna happen if I do this if I do that?

57:25.740 --> 57:28.180
I don't know my wife's not having trouble beating the game

57:28.940 --> 57:31.840
Well, your wife has a super brain or something. No, I don't know

57:32.940 --> 57:37.740
It's a different way of thinking about it. No, I almost got a few words for you Loki. Okay, I

57:38.140 --> 57:41.140
Got I got there's a lot of people I know that have beat the game

57:41.140 --> 57:45.140
But it just it's a different way of thinking about it. You can't play it like you're playing bejeweled because you'll be screwed

57:45.140 --> 57:47.460
So yeah, pretty much it's all about the skulls

57:47.460 --> 57:50.160
You have to look at the screen and make sure there's no

57:50.620 --> 57:55.180
Skulls that you can line up first because if you don't get it, I swear to God the computer will every time

57:55.180 --> 57:58.380
I know they're ruthless, but that's that's challenge

57:58.940 --> 58:01.180
Yeah, I love unlocking stuff in the game

58:01.180 --> 58:04.820
I mean if I could just sit there and do those puzzles like all day just kills like

58:04.940 --> 58:07.580
Like my entire time on the train going to work

58:07.660 --> 58:11.380
No, so maybe this game is worth a little more than giving it credit for it

58:11.380 --> 58:13.380
But what so what don't you like about the game?

58:13.380 --> 58:16.280
I love that really gets on me is the music

58:16.280 --> 58:18.080
I mean yes supposed to be a medieval style

58:18.080 --> 58:22.520
But the music can be so low that I find myself almost passing out going to sleep

58:22.520 --> 58:25.840
I'll get that music's a little generic in the game. It's nothing too special

58:27.240 --> 58:30.760
Alright, well tell us a little more about the other game. So you're gonna be what is a fan of hourglass?

58:31.280 --> 58:34.400
Fan of hourglass. Ah, what about so good is it?

58:35.120 --> 58:36.720
Yes, I mean I'm playing it

58:36.720 --> 58:37.200
I'm like

58:37.200 --> 58:41.800
This is so much like a link to the past to me the way I'm the way to have it set up

58:41.800 --> 58:43.800
And this is what it reminds me so much of

58:44.480 --> 58:48.680
Honestly, I didn't even know you controlled link with the stylus up what the game and I'm like

58:48.680 --> 58:55.520
I don't know if I'm gonna like this but ten minutes in I'm like, okay, I could definitely rock this this this is it

58:55.520 --> 58:57.000
This is fun

58:57.000 --> 59:01.560
Interesting. I see I'm still not sure I feel about it. I'm gonna try and borrow it for my friend

59:02.120 --> 59:04.280
Because I'm starting to get poor from all these games

59:04.280 --> 59:07.880
I'm buying so I definitely want to try and borrow it from somewhere of it. That's kind of cool

59:07.880 --> 59:12.640
Hmm, so I mean, how does it compare to other handheld Zelda games?

59:12.640 --> 59:18.760
I mean does that does the whole stylus element just really change things for the better for the worst or just you know

59:18.760 --> 59:20.760
The new gen or whatever you want to call it. I

59:21.160 --> 59:24.440
Think it makes things for the better though. I mean because the last

59:24.960 --> 59:31.560
Bunch of portable Zelda games. What do we have like Oracle of Ages Oracle of Seasons a link to the past the port of that

59:31.560 --> 59:33.560
You know

59:33.560 --> 59:40.400
But none of those were bad games. Yeah, but they were just kind of the Super Nintendo games on in handheld form

59:40.440 --> 59:45.480
Yeah, definitely. Oh, could you look one second? Hold on? Did we just get it? Oh, no, no

59:45.480 --> 59:51.480
No, I'm my roommates playing Guitar Hero 3 and I think he's on the very last song. Oh my gosh

59:52.400 --> 59:58.080
Yeah, how funny. Oh, yeah, that's pretty hardcore. You gotta be playing that game a lot to get that far

59:58.080 --> 01:00:03.960
All right, Rama any other quick thoughts? We gotta let you go to try take one more call before we sign off about

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:08.520
Loki's tingle costume. Yes, he'll green or bright green

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.060
Are you gonna make him a costume? I know people that will do it

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.520
You got don't get don't put the cart before the horse

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.680
The game has to sell million copies and sell million copies

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.220
But it when it does because I get the fabric for cheap by the way, it's a win-win situation

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:29.740
I'm pretty sure it's a darker green very similar to what link wears, but when it the game sells you a million copies

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:35.020
We'll send you Loki's measurements. It's not gonna sell million copies. It's told that would be

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.420
extremely

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:40.800
Extremely unlikely you have to admit what a hilarious Christmas gift. That would be

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.340
Well, it wouldn't be Christmas since six months from now

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:51.220
All right, Rama we got we gotta let you go. But thanks so much for calling in. All right, take care

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:56.620
It would be a fun six-year anniversary gift because over the show

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:57.140
Yeah

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.700
Because that it's approximately six months idea

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:04.820
I have to do dark soccer and I might have to go to Hancock fabrics or whatever fabric stores are out there go get some

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:08.420
Fabric go to LA. So just go to New York and meet up with Rama's friends

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:12.100
I think this is gonna be last call tonight folks. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns radio. Who's this?

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.180
It's puppy

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.860
What are you so what's on your mind? Why aren't you in studio tonight? We have a fourth mic now. Oh

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:26.060
You do. Well, well, I have a guitar here with me and that's what I've been busy with today fair enough fair enough

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:28.060
Well, how is the game? How you enjoying it? I?

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.180
Like it a lot. I'm a little bit

01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:34.100
peed off at the amount of selling out that

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:38.940
Activision did with the game because I got by the time I got to the third set of songs

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:42.260
I had already seen like four new companies advertising in the game

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:48.060
Really? How did they advertise the companies in the game? Because maybe I'm just oblivious. I'm like totally missed it

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:53.040
Well, I live in the Guitar Center stuff for a store that I didn't notice that

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.140
too

01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:01.820
It seemed I thought there was acts doing some stuff. They have acts guitar patterns and

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:07.860
These acts girls that come out and dance during some of those encore stages Wow

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:14.420
And then Pontiac came out and the whole there's one whole stage where it's just like the Pontiac garage

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:19.420
Like from Jimmy Kimmel live or whatever it is because it's supposed to be some sort of fancy music video set

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:24.340
Interesting and Pontiac car comes and runs you over and that's hilarious

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:27.020
But but at the same time I look at this and go, okay

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:32.020
Would I rather we have the Pontiac stage of Guitar Hero or the Yaris game?

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:36.940
You know here here's what one thing I've heard that they forgot to mention about Guitar Hero

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:42.660
That's really fucking awesome the intro and the fucking cutscenes that are in this game are the cartoons

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.660
Yeah, there's the car so cool

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:49.540
Why don't they just do Guitar Hero cartoon series every fucking cooler than the game?

01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:59.300
Loki feels very strongly about his dislike of Guitar Hero over here. Well, hey, they've already done that before it was called

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:06.760
Legend of Black Heaven and it was an anime thing about this this like middle-aged guy who becomes a rocker again and fights aliens

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:11.860
It's awesome cartoons the cutscenes made me think of what the hell's metal op. What's that show on Cartoon Network?

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:18.500
It's a metalocalypse. Thank you. That's that's that's what the cartoon things made me think of and I don't watch the show a whole lot

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:25.300
But anyway, I'm sorry about because I would be funny. Yeah, so what did you we made you talk about Guitar Hero?

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.300
What did you actually want to call in talk about tonight?

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:30.100
Well

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:37.240
Other than Guitar Hero. Yeah, that's what I've been spending most of my time on but I just was wondering that also

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:42.720
but you know with all the you were mentioned earlier about the halo 3 downloading videos and

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.440
Game views and stuff like that

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:50.840
He was wearing food actually seeing a bunch of the stuff that they that had been coming out recently with all the all the funny

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:56.000
Little clips of like people getting killed by cones and shooting themselves in the head with sniper rifles

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:56.480
No

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.720
But you need to send me some of the best ones and I will simply because like I've been playing so many other games like

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:06.240
It was his halo because now we're getting into that, you know gaming barrage or like it seems like every week

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.200
I'm playing a new game. I want to play and then next year

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.400
I'm gonna go back and catch up on everything

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:14.720
So at some point I will have to go I get that but I love I love like taking the pictures and putting them online

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:20.040
I mean forget looking at other people's stuff. I like playing with my own stuff that I create is fun

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:25.800
But to be honest, I haven't touched halo 3 in about a week at least so I I need to look up some of this

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:28.100
Funny stuff. So please please send me some fun

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:33.980
Oh, yeah a bunch of a bunch of the stuff is actually on YouTube that some of the more popular stuff and it's all free

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.500
advertising for halo 3 all free advertising. Oh

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.340
Yeah, definitely

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:44.140
I want to say this real quick going to the chat room some comments Sephiroth1215 says

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:50.020
Actually, the game should be cheaper because of ads speaking about guitar hero ads but Activision is too damn greedy

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:57.460
So they make a music game $60 seriously. That's way too much for a game that didn't cost that much in development. Ouch

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:04.620
Well in all honesty all that money probably went to the celebrities that you that they had in the game because I mean they got

01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.940
Slash and

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:14.220
Tom Morello, and I think a lot of original versions of songs too. Yeah, and like the lead singer from poison

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:19.660
I forgot what his name was Brett Michaels. He did all the all the motion capture for the singers in the game

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:26.780
What did you think of the new version of anarchy in the UK? I

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.220
Haven't gotten there. I never had heard that song before

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:36.420
It's the first time I think the sex pistols have been together since the 70s

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:42.580
To record anything. I I saw that that was an unlockable video that you could get so I might have to check that out

01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:47.860
I remember the old song and I know the bad bad guitar freaks cover, but I'm curious about what this man

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.980
They were Monday must have been hard up for money then

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:56.420
All right, well puppy we gotta let you go cuz we're gonna go wrap up the show but thanks so much for calling all right

01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:01.980
All right, right and come back to the show in the future. I don't live that way. All right, you better

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:04.660
All right. Take care

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:11.240
Escapist in our chat room says Brett Michaels should have paid to be in guitar hero 3 instead of being paid

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:16.900
I kind of agree. It's great exposure for these folks and in some extent. I mean, I don't know God

01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.820
Maybe I'll see something controversial here. But some of these people are kind of washed up like Brett Michaels

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:26.940
I mean, well, he has that show on vh1, but you know, yeah, where does it make a room washed up at all?

01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:32.820
Yes, that's true. That's you don't vh1. That's pretty much the definition of wash. Let me and true true and

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:36.620
you know, I don't know slash is a great guitarist, but

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:41.540
Not the mainstream doesn't talk about slash but now they might so you're right

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:44.560
These guys maybe ought to be paying them to be in the game. Who knows?

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.540
Anyhow, we've been going at this a long time. So I think it's finally time to wrap this up and call it a night

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.880
So we're gonna go around and get everybody's

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.360
Final thought actually, I do we didn't get last minute stories. They may have more than getting last minute

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:02.680
I'm sorry, then let's get last minute stories real quick. Anyways, um, so a few things first off

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.320
Let's see game stops drop their Xbox 360 product replacement plans

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:14.220
So apparently now they're no longer fixing those. I guess Microsoft will have to do more of that

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.220
Let's see here

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:22.280
Grip shift has been rated for the Xbox 360 if you might remember that was like crappy ass game

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:26.060
They came out on the PlayStation Network and also on the PSP

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:32.460
I highly recommend if it does come out on live arcade do not fucking buy it. It's horrible horrible horrible

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:40.540
That crappy Xbox live arcade game stick is now 50% cheaper in the UK still shouldn't buy it though

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:48.460
There is a wonderful application made by Microsoft. I guess employee Adam Keener or Kenny

01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:50.340
Kenny

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:58.080
Anyways, it's Xbox live friend tracker. It's a little sidebar program that you run in Windows that will allow you to

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:05.080
Track your friends on live kind of fun. There was a new we channel that was announced that kind of got

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.080
under the radar here apparently the

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:16.560
Channel is nicknamed as a TV program schedule channel. In other words, it's a channel where you can find out what's on TV

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:22.080
I don't know about I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure on most cable networks

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:27.080
Especially if it's satellite or digital cable. There's a guide button on your remote

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:33.080
To see what's on TV. Do we really need this on here and people are speculating?

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:38.440
Oh, it's gonna lead to an lead to an IP TV channel. Yeah, where the fuck are you gonna store that shit on the Wii?

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.520
That's what I'd like to know

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:44.080
If you're ordering Super Mario Galaxy

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:49.440
You ain't getting your pre-order coin until the fucking game comes out not that you really should order the game

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:56.020
Because of that coin also might remind you that that game is gonna be fucking hard to find around holidays

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:57.560
So if you haven't pre-ordered it yet

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:03.700
It's time to do it because it's gonna be like the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess where it's near impossible to find

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:11.360
And then finally Gran Turismo 5 they've had some of the features announced for it including there's gonna be an online

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.820
Garage course online head-to-head racing time trials track of the day be spec race

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:25.620
a license test drift contest tuning and setting features friends lists Lobby voice chat bulletin board
