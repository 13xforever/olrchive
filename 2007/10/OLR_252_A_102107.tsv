0	20960	Tonight, October 21st, 2007, Street Fighter is back for more in SF4, Sega brings its characters
20960	26120	to a new tennis game, and a classic video game movie returns to at least one big screen.
26120	31640	Orange Lounge Radio
31640	36560	Hello everybody out there on the Internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36560	41640	We are that podcast on the Internet dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer
41640	42800	lifestyle.
42800	43800	My name is Rob Roberts.
43800	48520	Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
48520	49520	Hi.
49520	50520	How are you doing, Jamie?
50520	51520	I'm here.
51520	52520	You're here?
52520	53520	I'm here too.
53520	54920	And we're here to talk about games.
54920	56520	So joining us, the one and only Loki.
56520	57520	Hello.
57520	59160	How are you doing, Loki?
59160	60160	I'm doing fine.
60160	64200	Now, I notice, and probably the folks on the operator 11 feet are noticing too, unless my
64200	67920	big old butt's blocking the way, that you actually have a little Guitar Hero 3 box laid
67920	68920	out here.
68920	69920	Tell us the story.
69920	70920	What's going on here?
70920	75880	I have a Guitar Hero 3 demo kit that retailers would be getting and anybody that has the
75880	79600	Guitar Hero 3 game playing in their store would be getting one of these.
79600	85240	And inside is the brand new guitar for Guitar Hero 3 for the 360, except it's kind of rare
85240	87720	because it is a wired version instead of wireless.
87720	88720	Interesting.
88720	92480	Not that I really give a damn if it's wireless or not, I mean, because that's one less battery
92480	93480	I need, so.
93480	96400	Now, are we going to be unboxing that on operator 11 a little later?
96400	97400	Yeah, sure, why not?
97400	98400	All right, sounds good.
98400	99400	So check that out.
99400	103440	Remember, we do always webcam our show as well on operator11.com.
103440	107200	Usually it's pretty boring, but just sitting here watching our big talking faces doing
107200	110880	the show, but now we have little cool things like this to show you guys, and we'll talk
110880	113760	about that later, and show you guys the interchangeable face plate on the guitar, which I thought
113760	114760	was pretty neat.
114760	118040	I still haven't figured out how to take that off completely, I'm afraid I'm going to break
118040	123760	it and I don't want to, but they do have face plates that they're going to be selling.
123760	127920	I've seen them, they're kind of ugly, but hey, they're face plates.
127920	128920	All right.
128920	132880	Well, let's start off the show talking about our gaming week, so we'll go over to Dark
132880	133880	Soccer.
133880	136040	How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?
136040	139160	It was very singular.
139160	141120	Meaning you only showed love to one game?
141120	142120	Ragnarok.
142120	143120	Of course, Ragnarok.
143120	144760	How was the Ragnarok addiction going?
144760	146040	It was great.
146040	151500	I've got another character up to the second job level now.
151500	154020	What exactly does that mean in English?
154020	157880	It means you have a first job level and a second job level, and I hit the second job
157880	160040	level.
160040	161640	So what are your jobs?
161640	163760	Are you still that one where you kick people in the face?
163760	166460	Well, yeah, I've got that one.
166460	170960	She's on the second part of kicking people in the face.
170960	173400	Like first you learn how to kick people in the face with your right foot, and then you
173400	174400	learn about your left foot?
174400	175400	Is that how it works?
175400	180200	Actually, I'm working on a merchant to blacksmith now, and I have, what do I have now?
180200	186440	I have two crusaders, a blacksmith, a fire mage, who I'm building up to sage.
186440	192760	I have two assassins, one of them hit level 91 this week.
192760	196840	I have a dancer who looks like a hoochie.
196840	197840	Fun.
197840	198840	Yeah.
198840	199840	All right.
199840	200840	Well, enjoy your Korean MMOs.
200840	203240	Of course, we'll go over to the chat room.
203240	207440	Our always present fourth guest on the program, chat.orangelongeradio.com, especially tonight
207440	210280	because unlike weeks past, we're actually kind of quiet here in studio tonight.
210280	213800	It's just the three of us, so we have to show a little love to our chat room.
213800	218760	We always love the comments, and we'll start off tonight with Wetu says, of course, dark
218760	222880	Sakura and Korean MMOs, of course.
222880	225740	Loki, how was your gaming week?
225740	228480	My gaming week was pretty filled.
228480	240680	I would say, God, let me start off with I played Conan on Xbox 360, and it's interesting.
240680	245440	It's actually very much of a rip off of God of War, but that's not a bad thing.
245440	247880	It's still a pretty good game.
247880	252200	And let's see, I also tried, of course, Beautiful Katamari, and I actually finished that game
252200	255240	because it's very short.
255240	262920	I tried the, what else did I play here, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.
262920	265480	I tried the demo for that.
265480	269640	You know, it's a good looking game.
269640	270920	The cars look good.
270920	275680	The track that they picked, though, to showcase it, I wouldn't have picked that one, just
275680	280960	because it really doesn't look that great, and you know, minor complaints, and I know
280960	286320	this is kind of nitpicking, but the rear view mirrors on your car, for example, the side
286320	292360	rear view mirror lacks a lot of the detail that's in like your center rear view mirror,
292360	296320	so it makes no sense why they couldn't just have the same level of detail on that stuff.
296320	301240	Also, the crowds still are like little, you know, canned animation things, and I know
301240	302240	that Project...
302240	303240	Paper dolls?
303240	306440	Which, I know Project Gotham does the same thing, but you know what, Project Gotham looks
306440	311240	way better, and you know, this isn't really a huge deal right now because Project Gotham
311240	317200	is only on 360, but come, you know, a year from now when Project Gotham Racing 5 is probably
317200	321720	going to be coming out, and Gran Turismo 5 is coming out at the same time, sadly enough,
321720	324560	I think a lot of people are going to buy Project Gotham over in Gran Turismo.
324560	327160	Wait, back up, though, doesn't Microsoft own the Project Gotham?
327160	329560	They just sent it out to Bazaar to do it, so...
329560	332760	Yeah, but I don't know if that, if they own the rights to the game or not.
332760	334280	It might be just Bazaar's game.
334280	336560	I'm pretty sure Project Gotham is a Microsoft IP.
336560	340800	I know you told me about this for the show, but now it's like, I'm pretty sure, unlike
340800	346480	Mass Effect, Project Gotham Racing is a Microsoft IP that they gave to Bazaar Creations.
346480	352680	Let me put it this way, I mean, your choices for sim racing games on the Playstation 3,
352680	357840	or even the Playstation 2, were pretty much limited to Gran Turismo, and that's it.
357840	361680	If you don't want, if you're looking for a sim racing game, that was your only choice,
361680	363800	for the most part.
363800	366820	So probably at the Playstation 3, it's going to be the same deal.
366820	370720	I'm just saying, you know, for them, putting all this hype behind it, and trying to even
370720	377240	sell this kind of demo of a game before it comes out, you know, officially, I don't know,
377240	379240	it's not, it's not that great.
379240	383640	But if you're really dying to play some Gran Turismo, I highly recommend checking out the
383640	387600	demo first, and then judging it based off that, see if you want to buy it or not.
387600	393720	It looks good, but I just, you know, after seeing the video, the video of it looked really,
393720	397720	really nice, but when you're playing the game, it's not as nice, so I don't know.
397720	403600	I'm trying to think if there's anything else that I played that was really awesome.
403600	407640	I think that's pretty much it, other than, you know, Saints Row, because I've always
407640	409360	been playing Saints Row now.
409360	410360	Always.
410360	414720	My gaming week, yeah, I spent a large part of my week in Southern California, no, I did
414720	417000	not go to E for All, actually.
417000	420480	I decided instead of going to E for All, I was going to go to Disneyland, because, and
420480	423160	I think I've said this on the show before, I felt like if I was going to go to E for
423160	428080	All, I was going to end up working, quote unquote, the whole time, and honestly, I just
428080	433400	felt that the games to see at E for All, there was just going to be huge crowds for all that
433400	439280	stuff, and the media invites I was getting, not a lot of real wowing kind of stuff, so
439280	443720	I said, you know what, I'm going to just take a real vacation from both of my jobs, Orange
443720	448160	Orange Radio and my day job, and I'm going to go to Disneyland, so I spent the week playing
448160	452120	Buzz Lightyear once again, and I got the number 17 high score for the day one time I played,
452120	456160	I have a picture to prove it, heh heh, anyway, no, but seriously, other video games I've
456160	460280	been playing, I did play Typing of the Dead before I left, because I remember we had this
460280	463200	story on the show a couple weeks ago, where we were talking about how they added Typing
463200	468120	of the Dead to GameTap, I'm like, I've got to go play that, and it's still as wonderful
468120	472440	as I remember it, and it runs great on the computer, so I was very happy about that.
472440	476640	Even though it is the PC version that GameTap is emulating, not the Dreamcast version, but
476640	480000	they still do have the Dreamcast strapped to their backs, and that's, you know, the
480000	482440	part we all know and love.
482440	488160	Also, a large majority of my gaming week otherwise was spent playing E4, the other E4, not the
488160	494080	Expo, but every Xtend Xtra Xtreme, which came out on Xbox Live this week, which I think
494080	498440	the game has a lot more depth than you might realize at first, because there is the main
498440	502640	game mode, which, I don't even know how to explain this, is basically a game of setting
502640	504520	off chain reactions.
504520	508440	Basically you explode your ship, and you're trying to set off chain reactions with other
508440	511520	things that are floating around the screen, but there's a catch.
511520	516280	Even though your ship regenerates once the chain reaction is done, your shields are only
516280	519440	on for about two seconds once you regenerate.
519440	523280	After those two seconds are up, anything on the screen can kill you, so you want to commit
523280	526600	suicide before something on the screen kills you, because if something on the screen kills
526600	528800	you, you basically have to go back to start.
528800	533520	The game time is limited to three minutes, but you can collect power-ups throughout the
533520	534520	game.
534520	538240	You can collect a power-up to extend your game time, a power-up to extend your shield
538240	543120	time, a power-up to make things float on the screen faster and increase the beats of the
543120	546720	song, that's what they call the quicken, or you can pick a power-up that increases your
546720	548640	bonus multiplier.
548640	553220	Basically that's essentially the core component of the game, so you get higher and higher
553220	557080	bonuses if you actually detonate your ship in time to the music.
557080	563160	It's a game by Tetsuya Mizuguchi who did Luminous and a bunch of other stuff I love, and I played
563160	567520	every Sin Extra on the PSP, so I knew I was going to like this game, and I do.
567520	571320	The game has a lot of depth, it has the regular game mode, and then it has a shooter mode,
571320	575320	it's called the revenge mode, where you can go around and actually, it's just a shooter,
575320	579520	it doesn't even bother with the music or the exploding, it just shoots things.
579520	583680	So that was kind of interesting, but then there's another mode, and it's pretty intricate
583680	589080	the way they set it up, but you can actually, using the whole media center and doing the
589080	593480	MP3s on your Xbox 360 through the network, you can actually configure every Sin Extra
593480	599440	Extreme to read those songs, and you can work with the game to either auto-detect the BPM
599440	604240	or set the BPM by button-tapping or whatever, so you can use your own songs in the game,
604240	609180	which is kind of cool, it's kind of fun to be able to play the game with your own songs.
609180	612320	So that being said, the game has a lot of depth, and I think it is worth the $10, but
612320	618920	the game has some really major flaws, I think, and one is the fact that I managed to keep
618920	623600	a game going for 70 minutes the other day, and I found that I was getting very bored
623600	628560	of the default songs, so I was very surprised that unlike the PSP version, the game did
628560	633860	not increment in stages, and I realized maybe that's a different game, this wasn't necessarily
633860	637120	supposed to be a direct port of the PSP version, but I kind of liked that better when there
637120	641240	was that more sense of accomplishment as opposed to the fact of, I've survived for 70 minutes
641240	644200	now and my thumbs are getting numb, so I'm just going to suicide, which is what I ended
644200	646920	up doing.
646920	652480	The other thing that actually kind of makes me wonder why they chose to do this in the
652480	656840	game is that the graphics aren't that good, and I was kind of surprised, like compared
656840	661300	to the PSP version, which has these very bright visuals and different types of backgrounds
661300	668120	and different skins, I kind of felt that this game just had white on black, and the types
668120	672440	of objects that would float around the screen would change depending on what stage you were
672440	677800	playing, and the little ships that get into it as well, that's really about it, like the
677800	681880	backgrounds don't change too much, granted when you set off big combos, you get some
681880	686680	different rainbow patterns like the familiar cover looking chick and the rainbow circles
686680	693000	and stuff, but there wasn't the amazing seizure-inducing backgrounds of the PSP version, and I kind
693000	697180	of was disappointed, like I was expecting a little more from the game graphically, especially
697180	702240	with such a vibrant game like Luminous, and I understand the game relies on the chains
702240	706300	and the explosions to kind of give that vibrance, but I don't know, I kind of felt it was boring,
706300	711620	there wasn't a lot to entertain me after 70 minutes of playing one round of this game,
711620	715780	so it kind of didn't add up to a lot, so that was a bit of a disappointment, but overall
715780	719360	I think it is a good value for money, especially if you're not a PSP owner, I think it is a
719360	720360	fun game.
720360	724080	I did play a little bit of Luminous because they have the new content, I neglected to
724080	729740	download the holiday pack, but I did download the new Genkai Rocket song, Breeze, mediocre
729740	734200	at best, I did not enjoy Breeze, which is sad because I love love love love love Heavenly
734200	740140	Star and I love the video, but Breeze is basically the same concept for the video, the cartoon
740140	745080	Asian girl bouncing around, which makes sense because Genkai Rockets is supposed to be like
745080	750560	a, sorry, it's supposed to be like a cartoony band or whatever it is, you know, I don't
750560	751560	know.
751560	754040	Cartoon Heroes did it.
754040	757440	So did Gorillaz, but you know, it's just, at least, Gorillaz did it best, but there's
757440	762440	different, well you're a fangirl, there's different, there's variance in the Gorillaz
762440	766600	videos, you know what I mean, like their videos are all different, say what you will, like,
766600	768080	dislike, all the videos are different.
768080	772040	Actually actually actually, the videos only got different when you got to Demon Days,
772040	775680	the first album ones were not different.
775680	776680	They need to vary it up a little bit.
776680	780720	Well, I mean, they couldn't keep that level of, you know, I mean, Heavenly Star and, you
780720	784960	know, Shining were both really good, and, you know, eventually they're going to have
784960	786560	to have a mediocre song.
786560	791960	All right, going to chat room for some comments, chat.orangelandradio.com, pikaruno says, the
791960	795680	new seasonal luminous life pack is awesome and you should buy it right now.
795680	798880	I've heard good things about it, so I'm contemplating buying it, we'll see.
798880	802400	As long as I don't have any speed mixes of fucking Christmas songs.
802400	803400	Oh, yes, please no.
803400	806640	I'm looking at you, DanceMania, I'm looking at you.
806640	811120	Gerardimo says, they're trying to set you up with microtransactions like in Luminous,
811120	815480	who knows, maybe, maybe that's where my backgrounds are, there are going to be microtransactions
815480	816480	later on.
816480	819600	Well, I refuse, I'm putting my foot down this time on the microtransactions, damn it.
819600	823200	So you're paying less than a penny?
823200	829640	Well, look, it's, I know we've had this discussion about micro and macrotransactions, but that's,
829640	834480	you know, despite, it's still what people call it.
834480	838400	Gerardimo is also still having fun with the E4 demo.
838400	841960	Darktids Studio says, Loki, what, speed mix of Jingle Bells doesn't do it for you?
841960	842960	No, it doesn't.
842960	843960	It doesn't.
843960	844960	All right.
844960	850680	Oh, GS68 would also like to point out, speeding up a song does not equal a remix.
850680	851680	Good point.
851680	854360	All right, well, that's going to do it for our gaming weeks.
854360	858360	So adding heavy synth to it does make it Eurobeat.
858360	859360	It might.
859360	863880	And, you know, having some guy singing about fire, whatever, if I just insert blank of
863880	865280	fire and it's instant Eurobeat.
865280	868440	Oh, we'll get into remix stuff later on.
868440	871360	I have some complaints with certain artists out there.
871360	872360	Oh my.
872360	873360	All right.
873360	877120	Did I mention that Luminous does have, or I'm sorry, not Luminous, Every Sin Extra Extreme
877120	880280	does have a remix of Heavenly Star in it.
880280	881280	It's not that great.
881280	882280	I'm sorry to say.
882280	884280	You probably have already heard it, too.
884280	885280	Maybe.
885280	886280	All right.
886280	888040	Let's go into tonight's news.
888040	890280	We don't have a lot of housekeeping tonight.
890280	894120	I will then, therefore, use the opportunity to plug our communities.

895840	897640	Add us as your friend on Myspace.
897640	899480	We post bulletins with extra stuff.
899480	903440	We actually did a whole bonus show last week because of our outage after the show, and
903440	907800	so we posted it to our Myspace people and the live journal people at Orange Lounge.
907800	912400	We also have a community on Facebook, but I've been irritated with Facebook lately because
912400	916940	I'm getting sick of getting the invites for, so and so wants you to be on their team for
916940	918040	quiz show.
918040	921080	So and so wants you to join them in the battle of ninjas versus pirates.
921080	925840	I'm like, this so and so doesn't give two shits and is thinking about deleting his account.
925840	929480	Did you hear that the Mass Effect characters are now on Facebook looking for friends?
929480	932560	I could give a shit, honestly.
932560	935120	I hope they find no friends on Facebook.
935120	936600	I am not happy with Facebook.
936600	940440	Facebook was cool like six months ago before they started adding all the, like you would
940440	946520	think usually like user created mods are a good thing for almost everything you can think
946520	947520	of.
947520	948520	No.
948520	949880	Not Facebook.
949880	955200	Facebook has somehow proven that, you know, user enabled created mods can single handedly
955200	956560	make your site suck balls.
956560	959920	Just like user created themes for Myspace.
959920	963080	Now everybody's yelling at me to just block the applications.
963080	964760	Can I block everything?
964760	966960	Can I just put, is there like a box, block everything?
966960	968360	Maybe I'll do that.
968360	969520	I didn't even know that was a feature.
969520	971440	See, this is why I love chat.
971440	972440	Chat educates me.
972440	976380	In fact, I will check Facebook right now while we get into some gaming news.
976380	977680	So let's start off.
977680	984560	So during this week there was a wonderful event in London, Capcom's Gamers' Day, and
984560	989360	of course their bombshell announcement for that event would be Street Fighter IV.
989360	992200	Oh my God, it's coming.
992200	995680	I mean I'm not too surprised that there's a Street Fighter IV, that's like saying there's
995680	999160	not going to be a Halo 4 or something like that, I mean come on.
999160	1004380	But okay, it is Street Fighter IV, it's supposed to continue with the 2D series, it's not going
1004380	1007400	to be 3D, so far at least.
1007400	1008400	Thank God.
1008400	1009400	That's a good thing.
1009400	1010400	That is a good thing.
1010400	1013760	And it doesn't have, you know, any other funky titles.
1013760	1018240	Although they didn't really show too much, they did have a nice teaser video showing
1018240	1020080	both Ken and Ryu fighting.
1020080	1022600	It was, I'm sorry, the teaser video was lame.
1022600	1026580	I mean it was nothing more than like a hype the crowd type thing when I'm sitting there
1026580	1029840	watching it on the computer, I'm thinking, show me the game.
1029840	1034560	I hate these stupid cinematic, like teasers that are nothing but cinematics, the CGI rendering.
1034560	1038360	We're in a day and an age of gaming where we know that's just all the BS cut scenes.
1038360	1040160	Like I want to see some actual game.
1040160	1043480	It would be awesome though if it was in that art style, because it was kind of like a water
1043480	1046880	colored type thing, but no.
1046880	1052520	So Street Fighter IV, it's going to be a fighting game, it'll probably be awesome, and out sometime
1052520	1053520	someday.
1053520	1054520	Yay!
1054520	1060920	Now let's see, GS68 says, nobody will play Street Fighter IV, arcade scene has been reduced
1060920	1064480	down to initial D4, and when, again, midnight, maximum 2 and 3.
1064480	1066200	Oh, people will play Street Fighter IV.
1066200	1069320	Well, because they're not going to gun for the arcades necessarily.
1069320	1072280	They're going to use Xbox Live and PlayStation Network to get people to play.
1072280	1073280	People still play the damn arcades.
1073280	1075840	I mean, come on, people still play Tekken there.
1075840	1076840	People still go to the arcades.
1076840	1078360	But there's still arcades out there.
1078360	1082000	There's not as many arcades, because arcade games have gotten more expensive, and if you
1082000	1086160	don't have the foot traffic, you're not going to be able to pay for your $6,000 game.
1086160	1089840	So that's why arcades are failing.
1089840	1096360	It's not because people stopped going to them, it's just that games got more expensive.
1096360	1100240	Out of curiosity, why would I bother to go to an arcade if I can just plug it in on my
1100240	1102920	Xbox 360 and sign into Live and play?
1102920	1105720	Because the D-pad sucks on Xbox 360.
1105720	1107360	Ouch, good point.
1107360	1108360	Touche.
1108360	1111160	What can ever replace the arcade experience?
1111160	1112160	That's true.
1112160	1115800	I know this is interesting coming from me on this program when you consider the three
1115800	1118480	of us all met, Hal, at an arcade, right?
1118480	1124200	But you know, arcades, they're saying in chat, they really have become nothing but gambling
1124200	1126200	for children and the ticket spitters.
1126200	1127600	It's sad.
1127600	1132340	Every good arcade I've ever known is gone or replaced with something that is under the
1132340	1138460	disguise of a good arcade, but it's not, I don't know, I'm sad.
1138460	1142960	So are you excited, I know you're a Capcom fighting girl fan, Dark Sakura, are you excited
1142960	1143960	about Street Fighter IV?
1143960	1144960	Hell yeah!
1144960	1147340	What do you hope they do differently this time?
1147340	1148340	Take out Chun-Li.
1148340	1150680	No, they can't do that!
1150680	1152220	And put in Sakura.
1152220	1155440	Why would, they would never take out Chun-Li, why would they do that?
1155440	1158860	Because I'm sick of all of the fanboyism, seriously.
1158860	1166920	It's like, okay, her moves are all, she's like, I'm trying to, after a while, you know,
1166920	1170440	a character is in a game and you kind of like him at first, and then you just get so sick
1170440	1173760	of seeing them all the time, that you just want something fresh.
1173760	1178480	If they're gonna do, I would love to see Sakura in the game, older.
1178480	1184160	I would like to see Ibuki come back, because Ibuki was my Street Fighter III person.
1184160	1191200	And I want to see the guy with one arm taken out, what was his name, Oro?
1191200	1193120	He needs to leave.
1193120	1194120	And they need to...
1194120	1197200	He needs to come back, but missing another arm, or a leg or something.
1197200	1198200	That'd be awesome.
1198200	1199200	The joke will continue.
1199200	1203240	Because then he'd be Elena, and fight with his legs.
1203240	1206040	She was cool too, she needs to come back.
1206040	1211920	And they need to actually have, you know, do they have any characters in the game who
1211920	1212920	use Taekwondo?
1212920	1219000	Uh, Footy Monster says, Dark Sakura, fuck you, leave my beautiful thunder thighs alone.
1219000	1222160	Hey, I have a kick power, thank you.
1222160	1226600	I think that they should take Street Fighter IV and actually add other Capcom characters
1226600	1229840	into it, instead of just this Capcom versus shit.
1229840	1233640	Then you'd have Puzzle Fighter.
1233640	1237240	Not Puzzle Fighter, but Pocket Fighter.
1237240	1240360	I'm all fine with them putting in new characters.
1240360	1243520	You know, why not have some new characters to sell?
1243520	1245680	Like, you know, Soul Calibur III kind of did it.
1245680	1250520	They had the guy with the big old sickle and stuff, you know, they were able to sell out
1250520	1251520	new characters.
1251520	1256400	Seriously, don't follow the route of Tekken 6, I mean, because Bob, the fat guy that sort
1256400	1260860	of looks like Mario, and no, that's not a cool character.
1260860	1262720	You know what I would like to see?
1262720	1265860	I would like to see a tag mode.
1265860	1268560	Like the versus games.
1268560	1269560	I think that would be cool.
1269560	1275780	I also really wouldn't mind just another Capcom versus game that isn't like, what was it,
1275780	1276780	Fighting Evolution.
1276780	1281880	I want them to go back to the Marvel versus Capcom style that they did, because that was
1281880	1285160	probably one of their most solid fighting games.
1285160	1288760	But I wanted to have like a, you know what they need to do?
1288760	1292760	Instead of doing Street Fighter IV, we need another freaking CyberBots.
1292760	1295640	Blaze in our chat room is getting in on the Capcom crossover madness.
1295640	1299600	He says Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth in Street Fighter IV.
1299600	1300680	Objection.
1300680	1306480	They should just do a new game series called Capcom versus and then do like a new installment
1306480	1307480	each year.
1307480	1311840	No, I think they should focus on Street Fighter IV and making it good, and I don't think they
1311840	1313720	should do any of this crossover bullshit.
1313720	1317800	I think they should focus on making a new original fun game.
1317800	1322100	To talk to Son of Dad for a moment, they, first of all, the Final Fight characters were
1322100	1326240	in the Alpha series, and that is, it's a different type of game.
1326240	1328080	It plays different than How 3 was.
1328080	1331400	I mean, I kind of liked How 3 was with the parrying system.
1331400	1334560	I thought that was cool and that needs to stay.
1334560	1339800	Especially because I have one time parried a Shoryuken, so that was really cool.
1339800	1342640	That was my awesome moment.
1342640	1347120	But I think that they need to have a few more unique styles.
1347120	1348120	I thought it was really good.
1348120	1349180	They had a boxer in there.
1349180	1354320	They had, you know, the stupid one-armed guy that kind of grossed me out that would have
1354320	1355320	the style.
1355320	1356320	They need a luchador.
1356320	1357320	They need a luchador.
1357320	1358320	No, they had one.
1358320	1359320	They had Vega.
1359320	1361320	He wasn't really a luchador, though.
1361320	1362320	No, not a luchador.
1362320	1363320	I'm thinking Matador.
1363320	1365680	No, they do need a luchador.
1365680	1367680	They need Mexican wrestling.
1367680	1370440	That'd be cool.
1370440	1375920	They need, well, there was Armeika in there.
1375920	1377720	In fact, Screw just a luchador.
1377720	1379760	They just need Santo in there.
1379760	1388840	No, they need to, oh god, they need a, well, not like a wrestler wrestler, but they need
1388840	1390720	like a big brawler.
1390720	1395240	Not like Zangief was, but just like this brute character.
1395240	1396240	Like T-Hawk?
1396240	1398640	No, T-Hawk was a wrestler.
1398640	1405840	They need this, just like the slow punch, like, oh god, who was it in Darkstalker?
1405840	1407880	Suddenly this game is turning into Saturday Night Slammasters.
1407880	1409360	The mummy guy?
1409360	1414360	Yeah, they need something like that, where they're slow and tough, but, you know, that's
1414360	1415440	just the thing.
1415440	1417520	They're slow and tough, and that's what's frustrating about them.
1417520	1418520	Do another Darkstalkers game.
1418520	1419520	That'd be kinda cool.
1419520	1421440	They need a, we need a good Darkstalkers game.
1421440	1425080	Okay, I love these comments from chat rooms on the crossover games.
1425080	1426760	GS68 says, fuck crossovers.
1426760	1428200	Stop feeding the fanboys.
1428200	1431680	Sephiroth1215 says, Street Fighter is only for Street Fighter characters.
1431680	1433080	You want other Capcom characters?
1433080	1434960	Play the Wacky Versus series.
1434960	1440760	Hey, I was hoping they'd come out with that other, another Sega Versus series, you know.
1440760	1444920	All I have to say is, thank god they're sticking with 2D, because I seem to remember there
1444920	1448520	was a 3D Street Fighter game, like, Roselle Golfland had it, didn't they?
1448520	1449520	And it was, oh god.
1449520	1450520	There was a 3D.
1450520	1451520	It was so horrible.
1451520	1455680	See, Son of Dad is saying exactly what I was thinking, that they need more unique styles
1455680	1456780	in the game.
1456780	1463000	And also, just to talk to hitson, I actually like Darkstalkers 3, and I've actually played
1463000	1465720	it where all the sprites on the screen, the character sprites on the screen were missing
1465720	1469480	because my employer at the time when I worked for an arcade was fixing it while I was playing
1469480	1472840	it, and beat the game that way.
1472840	1477600	But um, Fighters Megamix 2, that's a good idea.
1477600	1478840	Oh, thank you.
1478840	1480960	The chat room reminded me, I'm thinking of the EX series.
1480960	1482280	Those were the 3D ones.
1482280	1485360	Yeah, and Dark Knight reminds me that Capcom didn't do the 3D ones.
1485360	1486360	No.
1486360	1491760	Well, they should, like, sue whoever did it, again, just because people actually remember
1491760	1495360	how horrible those games are, so they should sue them again if they haven't already.
1495360	1497160	You know what game that I would like for them to make?
1497160	1502120	And this is what I would totally call it, too, is Capcom Fighting Universe.
1502120	1504160	Just a big clusterfuck of every character ever, or something?
1504160	1505680	You have your Rival Schools characters.
1505680	1506680	Oh, lordy.
1506680	1510640	You have your Alpha characters, you have your She-Fighter 3, you have your Cyberbot.
1510640	1512640	They did something like that, though.
1512640	1513640	They did that one.
1513640	1514640	Fangirl alert.
1514640	1515640	Fangirl alert.
1515640	1517680	I think that was, like, Capcom Fighting Evolution or something like that.
1517680	1519680	Yeah, but that game sucked.
1519680	1522160	Capcom Fighting Evolution sucked.
1522160	1524200	They need to just do...
1524200	1528280	You get the wolf from Okami, you get, you know, the guy from Dead Rising.
1528280	1531960	You choose your mode at the beginning of the game, and everyone fights in the same mode.
1531960	1534620	Alright, too much fanboy stuff for me.
1534620	1538680	We gotta move on with the other Capcom news, and speaking of the wolf from Okami, Okami
1538680	1541160	for the Wii has been confirmed.
1541160	1545100	Okami is coming to the Nintendo Wii in the spring of 2008.
1545100	1548720	If you've played Okami, it's the kind of game that really could benefit from some motion
1548720	1553160	controls, and certainly the game will be making use of the Wii-mote controls.
1553160	1557320	The motion controls will be used primarily for the Celestial Brush.
1557320	1561160	I'm actually excited about this because Okami's kind of one of those games everybody said
1561160	1564400	I should play and I didn't really get to play enough of, like, there was just so many games
1564400	1568000	coming out around that time, so this kind of allows a lot of people like me to take
1568000	1571500	a second look, just like when Resident Evil 4 came out for the Wii.
1571500	1572500	Same thing.
1572500	1574100	I think it's a good choice for them to bring it there.
1574100	1577640	I think it's an excellent choice, so I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out, Okami
1577640	1578640	on the Wii.
1578640	1584160	I don't know, and this is kind of off the subject a little bit, but I'm surprised they
1584160	1588320	even brought Viewtiful Joe to the Wii, but then that made me think, how much do you want
1588320	1593360	to bet that there might be a character announced that's Viewtiful Joe for Super Smash Bros.?
1593360	1594360	Interesting.
1594360	1595360	I don't know.
1595360	1599560	Because they did have that game that was sort of like Smash Bros. with Viewtiful Joe, but...
1599560	1603160	I think Viewtiful Joe's on ice for a little bit, and that's just fine, because, like...
1603160	1604160	It sucked.
1604160	1607880	Well, it started good, but then it was one of those, like, saturation...
1607880	1610120	It was a really good concept.
1610120	1613760	But it got too oversaturated, so I think Capcom's doing the smart thing right now, and Viewtiful
1613760	1617360	Joe, at least it seems to me anyway, is on ice for a little while, and that's just fine
1617360	1618360	by me.
1618360	1619360	The series needs to be on ice.
1619360	1622880	Well, there is a little bit more good Capcom news.
1622880	1629840	They have released word about a game called Dark Void that will be out next winter, developed
1629840	1636640	by Airtight Games, and they gave us Crimson Skies Hyrule to Revenge, so it is supposed
1636640	1643520	to be mid-air and on foot, and they haven't said what it's going to be on, although they're
1643520	1650620	thinking PS3 and Xbox 360, so it's a game where you go against these...
1650620	1654760	They're called the Watchers, and they've been watching, and now they stopped watching and
1654760	1655760	are doing...
1655760	1657240	What have they been watching me do?
1657240	1658240	Porn.
1658240	1659240	They watch...
1659240	1660240	Oh, noes.
1660240	1662240	Ceiling Watchers are watching you fap.
1662240	1664080	Oh, noes.
1664080	1670160	Well, hooray for original ideas, right, because this is a whole new IP for them, right?
1670160	1671160	Yeah.
1671160	1672160	It's a new world.
1672160	1673160	Well, good.
1673160	1679280	Well, folks that may have owned a PS3 and not a 360 may have missed out on the Lost
1679280	1680280	Planet series.
1680280	1681280	Well, fear not.
1681280	1682280	Capcom...
1682280	1683280	Unless you owned a computer.
1683280	1687600	Unless you owned a PC, but who owns a PC nowadays?
1687600	1689680	I mean, seriously, nobody.
1689680	1690680	Totally.
1690680	1692280	Yeah, nobody owns a computer.
1692280	1694040	Who plays games on PCs anymore?
1694040	1695760	That's just ridiculous talk.
1695760	1696760	Anyways.
1696760	1699520	No, but seriously, Lost Planet is coming to the PS3.
1699520	1704200	They're going to have all the features and download content that was available for the
1704200	1706320	PC and Xbox 360 versions.
1706320	1709560	It's supposed to come out in the spring, so hooray!
1709560	1714920	You get your Lost Planet in almost a year later.
1714920	1716620	Are they doing anything extra for it?
1716620	1717620	Extra levels?
1717620	1718620	Extra characters?
1718620	1719620	Extra...
1719620	1720620	Just the download content.
1720620	1721620	That's pretty much it.
1721620	1728000	I mean, it's not really that extra, I guess.
1728000	1730520	There's all the bonus stuff that was available already.
1730520	1732080	No dress-up mode?
1732080	1733080	No.
1733080	1734080	No.
1734080	1735080	That's too bad.
1735080	1738160	It says apparently now that it can fit all that stuff on the Blu-ray disc, so that's
1738160	1740040	why it wasn't downloading content now.
1740040	1741920	I like Son of Dad's comment in chat.
1741920	1747440	Son of Dad says in chat, chat.orange.onnashray.com, Lost Planet PlayStation 3?
1747440	1748440	No.
1748440	1750640	Dead Rising PlayStation 3?
1750640	1752120	Yes.
1752120	1753120	That would be sweet.
1753120	1757800	And honestly, if they're looking for a game that would take advantage of their little
1757800	1763440	shaker controller-like-an-idiot function, then Dead Rising would be a good one to eat
1763440	1764440	too.
1764440	1767840	But here's the thing, and this is kind of good news for you guys, because if you think
1767840	1772720	about it, I would think that they would pick Dead Rising over Lost Planet anyways, because
1772720	1776160	I think Dead Rising sold more anyways.
1776160	1781760	So that means, to me, that means that they're making a sequel, so instead of porting the
1781760	1784600	original, they're just going to make a sequel for both platforms.
1784600	1786680	Well duh, they've got to be making a sequel.
1786680	1788600	How could they not be making a sequel to Dead Rising?
1788600	1789600	That game exceeded expectations.
1789600	1793320	Please God, fix the damn save system, because that was horrible.
1793320	1796920	I stopped playing the game because of that, sadly.
1796920	1800040	That and the fact that my monitor sucked at the time, so I couldn't see anything in the
1800040	1801040	dark.
1801040	1804240	But, um, fix the save system.
1804240	1810160	Well, also coming out of Capcom Gamers' Day, lots of news from Gamers' Day this week, Super
1810160	1814520	Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix was playable at the show.
1814520	1817820	Only Ken and Ryu were actually selectable in the game, but that didn't prevent some
1817820	1822320	crappy YouTube video from going up, and folks could actually kind of see the game in motion.
1822320	1826760	We'll also announce there are some changes that we hadn't heard yet for what we have
1826760	1828520	in store for the game.
1828520	1832800	The HD Remix, of course, supports widescreen, you know, we kind of figured that would happen.
1832800	1837200	The music has all been completely remixed for the game, which doesn't actually surprise
1837200	1840340	me too much, I think we needed that too.
1840340	1847280	There will also be, however, not just the HD version, but an arcade mirror of the Super
1847280	1851420	Street Fighter II Turbo arcade version, so if you want your purest version, that will
1851420	1853400	be included in the game.
1853400	1858080	Also, apparently, some balancing has gone into effect, some rebalancing, I'm not sure
1858080	1863400	if that means some attacks do more damages or some characters' movements are different
1863400	1866500	or what have you, but there has been some rebalancing done.
1866500	1869940	Not the first time Capcom's gone back and rebalanced one of their games, just take a
1869940	1874640	look at Puzzle Fighter II, had some rebalancing going on with the drops, but if you wanted
1874640	1879800	to, you could also play in your arcade perfect nothing has been changed mode, which I think
1879800	1883760	is the way to do it in this day and age when you revisit your retro classics, yes?
1883760	1884760	Yeah.
1884760	1885760	All right.
1885760	1888960	I'm looking forward to that, even though I am still a little bitter, I've bought Street
1888960	1894360	Fighter II on Xbox once, you have to kind of think, all right, the same thing happens
1894360	1901160	with over-the-counter games, this is just kind of like getting number two in the series
1901160	1905800	or whatever, I don't know how else to phrase it.
1905800	1913240	Well, one other thing that I think is very, very, very cool, and I'm very, very, very
1913240	1919800	excited about this, is that Bionic Commando is getting a remake.
1919800	1921400	Fuck yeah, it's about fucking time.
1921400	1922400	Fuck yes.
1922400	1923400	This is an amazing game.
1923400	1925200	I wonder if you still get to kill Hitler in it.
1925200	1928680	No, but it still looks awesome if you've seen the video for it.
1928680	1933640	I've only seen the little preview that showed the screenshots, I've not seen the game in
1933640	1934640	motion.
1934640	1935640	No, the video is, oh yeah.
1935640	1940240	Because I was a little nervous about the 3D looking, I mean.
1940240	1946360	Well, at any rate, it's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
1946360	1951080	You know, I'm noticing that we're getting a lot more, what would have been usually a
1951080	1956360	console or only game on the PC now, there's a lot more love for PC gamers.
1956360	1961040	I don't know why, no one plays games on the PC anymore, seriously, nobody.
1961040	1963440	You know you just got yelled at by several people in chat.
1963440	1966420	I beat sarcastic people, shit, come on.
1966420	1967480	Are you that dumb?
1967480	1969480	Of course people play games on a PC.
1969480	1971120	How many million people play WoW?
1971120	1976680	That would mainly get our first person shooters on PC, but now we're seeing more and more
1976680	1982120	of them on consoles, and we're seeing more and more platformers come out for PC.
1982120	1986720	So it's like, the whole gaming community is now sort of banding together.
1986720	1990320	Well remember folks, the PlayStation 3 is a computer, remember?
1990320	1991320	No it's not.
1991320	1996400	No, but according to the marketing, that's a little more accurate.
1996400	1997400	Yes it is, no it's not.
1997400	1998400	Yes it is, no it's not.
1998400	2006280	Well at any rate, Capcom is working with Grin, they did a Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter
2006280	2015720	PC, and it also, they have not announced a Wii release.
2015720	2022240	And Tigerclaw in our chat room has something to say about the lack of a Wii buy on a Commando.
2022240	2024040	Surprisingly, no Wii version.
2024040	2027740	The game looks like something perfect for the Wii mode, and it's surprising that they're
2027740	2029120	not making it for it.
2029120	2034200	Nintendo could have cashed in on it by re-releasing the original NES version on the Virtual Console.
2034200	2038120	Well they'll probably still try to cash in on it anyways, but here's the problem though
2038120	2039320	with the Wii.
2039320	2041220	It can't handle the game!
2041220	2045600	Just because it has the little waggle controls and stuff that would be perfect for this.
2045600	2049480	Unfortunately Nintendo decided, hey you know what, we don't really care about graphics,
2049480	2052280	so sorry, can't make that.
2052280	2055560	However if they had ported it to the PlayStation 2, yeah we could port that pretty easy.
2055560	2059600	But wait a minute though, ultimately that was Capcom's decision to say we're going
2059600	2068720	to go for the highest quality in looks and sound department as opposed to incorporating
2068720	2069720	the wiggle waggles.
2069720	2074720	You have to understand that people on the PlayStation 3 and 360 love action games, much
2074720	2081640	like Dead Rising, Lost Planet, the new Bionic Commando game and stuff like that.
2081640	2087360	Wii gamers only like Zack and Wiki Quest for Rose Treasure.
2087360	2088600	That's the only thing that they can handle.
2088600	2091400	Oh yeah, that's my favorite fucking game right there.
2091400	2092400	That and Resident Evil 4.
2092400	2095040	It's a little mixed up there, but you know.
2095040	2102320	I think that Capcom could do something if they were willing to focus on gameplay more.
2102320	2105920	Then again, one of the things I've always enjoyed about many Capcom games is that they
2105920	2109420	do tend to have really good gameplay.
2109420	2110840	Fuck that, maybe some more Mega Man Legends.
2110840	2111840	I can go on the Wii.
2111840	2112840	Perfect.
2112840	2113840	Done.
2113840	2114840	That's a series that needs to die.
2114840	2118840	And M64 wants to remind you also on the Wii, mini games.
2118840	2119840	My mistake.
2119840	2120840	Lots of mini games.
2120840	2121840	Bionic Commando mini games.
2121840	2123840	Oh look, pop the bubbles.
2123840	2125840	Kill Hitler again and again.
2125840	2126840	Wii.
2126840	2127840	Oh yeah.
2127840	2128840	Who knows.
2128840	2129840	Wii.
2129840	2136280	Dapho in the chat room would like to say Zack and Wiki looks awesome, how dare that be bashed.
2136280	2139120	How dare you Loki on this program.
2139120	2144080	On this show, there's not much that we don't dare to do at different times.
2144080	2147800	Son of Dad would like to remind us all that Okami's being ported to the Wii and not to
2147800	2149880	next gen with sharp graphics.
2149880	2151880	So the Wii is getting kind of something that.
2151880	2155240	I think it's been proven that the Wii can handle cel shading fairly well.
2155240	2156760	Isn't Okami cel shaded?
2156760	2160960	I'm just awfully surprised that Wii's getting yet another PlayStation 2 port.
2160960	2166720	That's surprising with Resident Evil 4 and all those other fucking games that PlayStation
2166720	2170120	2, Xbox 360 ports, or Xbox ports.
2170120	2176800	Ryoma says if you're going to do the Bionic Commando mini games, pick Hitler's nose.
2176800	2180040	Like that one game in WarioWare.
2180040	2182560	This just in on the Smash dojo.
2182560	2185640	Hitler, the new character.
2185640	2188880	I don't know about that one.
2188880	2192120	I don't think so.
2192120	2201720	And M64 reminds you very subtly, but not really, that RE4 was a GameCube port, not a PS2 port.
2201720	2204620	I believe it was a PlayStation 2 port for this one because it had the upgraded graphics
2204620	2207680	from the PlayStation 2 and the additional features.
2207680	2209040	But yeah, it was on the GameCube too.
2209040	2214620	So they could have hybrid, you know, some bastard child of the GameCube and PlayStation
2214620	2215620	2 versions.
2215620	2218120	So what you're basically trying to say is I'm right and you're wrong.
2218120	2219120	Yes!
2219120	2223120	That's exact, thank you for nailing home my point there.
2223120	2224120	You're welcome.
2224120	2225120	That's what I do here.
2225120	2229560	All right, since these games won't be out until next year at the earliest, let's talk
2229560	2232400	about some stuff you can get right now, this week.
2232400	2237320	Definitely, and there's going to be lots of fun stuff coming out this week.
2237320	2245880	Some stuff, I don't know, people, why you want them or not, but of the many things the
2245880	2251320	ever controversial Eye of Judgment is coming out this week on PlayStation 3.
2251320	2257840	Yes, you will be able to play your Magic the Gathering type of crap with the eye, the PlayStation
2257840	2258840	Eye.
2258840	2263280	And remember folks, if one million copies of this game sell, Loki will dress up in a
2263280	2267240	tingle outfit and set an Eye of Judgment on fire for your very pleasure.
2267240	2268660	He should dance around it.
2268660	2271000	I think you should do this anyway because it'll be so fun.
2271000	2272520	I'm not going to do that.
2272520	2273520	You should burn it.
2273520	2274520	Stop trying to cop out.
2274520	2278680	Okay, if it doesn't sell a million though, while we will not require you to dress as
2278680	2282120	tingle, you need to at least wear the hat and burn it.
2282120	2283720	What hat?
2283720	2288520	Can we negotiate that maybe if they can sell 50,000 units, you'll just wear the little
2288520	2290400	green hat and set it on fire?
2290400	2291920	I'm not doing that.
2291920	2294560	It's all or nothing.
2294560	2295560	Damn it.
2295560	2298360	Will you at least set one on fire?
2298360	2300720	Maybe if someone sends me one for free, I'll set one on fire.
2300720	2302760	We should dance around it.
2302760	2304560	I'm not going to buy one to set one on fire.
2304560	2305560	That's stupid.
2305560	2306560	Let's see.
2306560	2307840	If we all put in 20 bucks, we could buy one to set on fire.
2307840	2308840	Come on.
2308840	2309840	Anyways.
2309840	2310840	BurnMyEyeOfJudgment.com.
2310840	2319800	Ace Combat 6 is coming out on Xbox 360, so that's pretty interesting.
2319800	2320800	I don't know.
2320800	2321960	It's a good game.
2321960	2325320	Client Marker's Jericho is coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2325320	2328440	It's a horror first person shooter game.
2328440	2333680	Conan also coming out in both systems as well, and as I reviewed it, it's pretty good, so
2333680	2336880	definitely worth checking it out.
2336880	2337880	Let's see.
2337880	2340280	King of Fighters XI on PlayStation 2.
2340280	2344320	And that's a really budget game too, $14.99 if I remember correctly.
2344320	2348240	Dancing with the Stars on the Wii and PlayStation 2.
2348240	2349240	And you know what?
2349240	2350240	Yippee.
2350240	2351240	That sounds fun.
2351240	2352240	Actually, it's only on the Wii this week.
2352240	2356940	PlayStation 2 is coming out later, but sadly enough, it doesn't look that bad.
2356940	2361720	The models in it look pretty decent, and the game's kind of a rhythm music game.
2361720	2365000	Do you have the professional dancers that are on the show?
2365000	2368280	Yeah, the show dancers, whoever's on the show.
2368280	2369280	I don't watch the show.
2369280	2371440	But are there celebrities programmed in?
2371440	2376440	Yeah, there's celebrities in there, but they move pretty smooth from the video I saw.
2376440	2378080	I'm not buying it, but hey.
2378080	2381560	Well, I think it would be a good idea if they used the X-Tango engine.
2381560	2383160	It might be cool to rent it.
2383160	2384720	I don't know if it's the X-Tango engine.
2384720	2385720	Hold on.
2385720	2389200	Are you guys actually hyping the Dancing with the Stars video game?
2389200	2390200	I would do it.
2390200	2391900	Dude, it's like 20 bucks, okay?
2391900	2393360	I like Dancing with the Stars.
2393360	2394360	I like X-Tango.
2394360	2395640	I guess I'll give you that.
2395640	2396640	Hey, hey.
2396640	2401440	I'm not saying this game is X-Tango, okay, because we're not going to dirty the X-Tango
2401440	2402440	name with this game.
2402440	2403440	Sorry.
2403440	2404440	My bad.
2404440	2405440	Apologies to the folks behind X-Tango.
2405440	2407480	Actually, I do like Dancing with the Stars, Rob.
2407480	2408480	Really?
2408480	2409480	But you don't watch TV, I thought.
2409480	2415280	I watch the dances on YouTube, because it was all about the Stacey Keebler series.
2415280	2416280	Okay.
2416280	2420160	PlayStation 3 is getting quite a few games here.
2420160	2422840	Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, yeah, you're finally getting that now.
2422840	2426600	Ratchet and Clank, Future Tools of Destruction, that should be pretty awesome.
2426600	2430040	Ratatouille, that's coming out.
2430040	2432840	And let's see here.
2432840	2438360	On the Wii, actually in PlayStation 2 as well, Nicktoons Attack of the Toy Bots.
2438360	2442240	This week also, the game I was just making fun of, Zack and Wiki, the Quest for Barbaros
2442240	2444180	Treasure is also coming out.
2444180	2445180	How dare you.
2445180	2450640	Namco Museum Remix, hooray, that's also coming out on the Wii.
2450640	2452640	And then let's see here.
2452640	2461640	Of course, on PSP, Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles, Warriors of the Lost Empires, I have no idea
2461640	2469320	what that is, and then see Spongebob Atlantis Squarepantis also coming out as well.
2469320	2479760	And on the DS, Phoenix Wright Trials and Tribulations, Mega Man X, or Mega Man ZX Advent, and Spanish
2479760	2483120	for Everyone, Naruto Path of the Ninja.
2483120	2485840	Wait, is that the name of a game, Spanish for Everyone?
2485840	2486840	Spanish for Everyone.
2486840	2490640	I want to say there's- What do you do in Spanish for Everyone?
2490640	2492640	You learn Spanish.
2492640	2494760	Oh.
2494760	2504480	Let's see here, Chess Master, The Art of Learning, that's what it's called, Imagine Master Chef.
2504480	2506760	I think the rest of the Imagine games are coming out this week.
2506760	2507760	Oh, that's right.
2507760	2510360	Imagine Animal Doctor is also coming out.
2510360	2511600	Imagine Babies.
2511600	2513960	Imagine Fashion Designer and Imagine Master Chef.
2513960	2515240	Finally, Imagine Babies.
2515240	2516240	You know what I want?
2516240	2518280	I want Imagine Sniper.
2518280	2519640	Sorry.
2519640	2524080	Unfortunately, Sniper's not that popular with little girls.
2524080	2525080	I wanted to be a sniper.
2525080	2529240	When it does become popular, they will have Imagine Snipers, but unfortunately, they don't
2529240	2530240	right now.
2530240	2531840	GS68 says, Imagine John Lennon.
2531840	2537280	Imagine, or I'm sorry, Pocket Pets, which is yet another pet raising sim, and apparently,
2537280	2542560	judging by the cover, it features bunnies, kittens, and little birdies.
2542560	2545080	Yay.
2545080	2547280	Where's the hippopotamuses, or hippopotami?
2547280	2551660	Tiger Claws says, Imagine OLR, by the way.
2551660	2558040	And then, I was going to say also, Naruto Clash of Ninja Revolution on Wii, and finally
2558040	2561480	just a small little game, of course, on almost everything.
2561480	2566720	PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, Wii, and maybe the PC this week.
2566720	2570760	And actually, a week from now, Guitar Hero 3 will be making its way out.
2570760	2571760	So.
2571760	2572760	Excellent.
2572760	2573760	On a Sunday.
2573760	2574920	Wait, is that out this Tuesday?
2574920	2575920	It's out on next Sunday.
2575920	2576920	Oh, it's on Sunday.
2576920	2578760	On the 28th.
2578760	2582840	Because they have to be so cool Sunday.
2582840	2586560	This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Guitar Hero 3, for everybody.
2586560	2587560	Let's see here.
2587560	2590640	I was going to say, I'm looking real quick on the PC stuff.
2590640	2596600	Oh, there are some interesting PC games I was going to mention real quick.
2596600	2601720	Dream Day Honeymoon, which I have no idea what that is, but I want to take a look here
2601720	2602720	real quick.
2602720	2604480	You want to go on a Dream Day Honeymoon?
2604480	2605480	Dream Day Honeymoon.
2605480	2608080	Actually, there's no information for that whatsoever, but that is available if you're
2608080	2610200	curious.
2610200	2614480	And some Agatha Christie game.
2614480	2615480	That's it.
2615480	2619800	Alright, let's travel over to Japan and see what our friends overseas in Japan are picking
2619800	2620800	up this week.
2620800	2628080	You can get on the Xbox 360, Bladestorm, the 100 Years War is coming out on the Xbox 360.
2628080	2633000	That's from Koei, who I believe brought you Dynasty Wars.
2633000	2637840	And oh, I forgot to mention, US Tomb Raider Anniversary on the 360.
2637840	2638840	It's my turn now.
2638840	2639840	My turn.
2639840	2640840	I'm done.
2640840	2641840	I'm done.
2641840	2642840	Alright.
2642840	2644400	Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party.
2644400	2650000	You Bimani fans over in Japan get a chance now with the Wii version of DDR, the latest
2650000	2654760	title finally hitting Japanese shelves this week.
2654760	2656920	I remember back in the day, it used to be the other way around.
2656920	2660920	Japan would get these games years before we would get them, and now it seems like we get
2660920	2661920	a few of these first.
2661920	2665620	Because I think the same thing happened with Supernova 2, I don't remember.
2665620	2671340	Also on the Nintendo Wii, Ghost Squad is coming out from Sega in Japan.
2671340	2674840	Also coming out on the Wii, the Simple Wii series.
2674840	2681480	There's volume 1, the Mina de Kart Race, and there's volume 2, the Mina de Basuri Takai
2681480	2682720	is coming out.
2682720	2686480	So I'm assuming that's like fishing and kart racing?
2686480	2687880	It's like a Mario Kart game.
2687880	2688880	Yeah.
2688880	2691560	That's fucking awesome that the Simple series is coming to the Wii.
2691560	2692560	Interesting.
2692560	2696480	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, a game from Sega, it's an action-adventure game, it looks
2696480	2697600	kind of scary.
2697600	2699840	It's called Imabe Kisu.
2699840	2702640	Do we have this game over here, or is this something that's coming out, being ported
2702640	2703640	over here?
2703640	2705440	I have not heard of this game, and I don't see screenshots.
2705440	2706440	No.
2706440	2707440	Let me see if I can find it.
2707440	2708440	What was it?
2708440	2709440	PlayStation 3, you said?
2709440	2710440	Yeah, it's on PlayStation 3.
2710440	2713620	I think it's done by the guy who did the Ring series and stuff like that.
2713620	2714620	It's kind of like that.
2714620	2717440	It's kind of a horror type of game.
2717440	2719480	That might be kind of fun.
2719480	2720720	Cool.
2720720	2724280	Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, you've been waiting for this one.
2724280	2725740	Let's make sure it sells a million copies.
2725740	2729320	The Eye of Judgment comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
2729320	2734480	Also coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 2, hey, God of War 2, the end begins.
2734480	2737920	Finally making its way with a Japanese translation this week.
2737920	2743580	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Itsuka Todoku Anosora Ni is coming out.
2743580	2748320	That's an adventure game that looks to be based on yet another anime starring cute little
2748320	2751360	girls in schoolgirl outfits.
2751360	2756280	Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, Baldur Bullet Equilibrium coming from Alchemist.
2756280	2759920	It looks like another mech warrior type game.
2759920	2767080	On the Nintendo DS, Dungeon Maker, Mahou no Shovel Tu Chisa Na Yuusha.
2767080	2770600	It's a role playing game, but hence the title, Dungeon Maker.
2770600	2774420	Some of you guys like to customize your own stuff, you'll probably enjoy that.
2774420	2780680	Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Final Fantasy Tactics A2, hooray, I know a lot of
2780680	2783400	folks have been waiting for the next tactics game on the DS.
2783400	2786520	If you haven't played the one on the PSP yet, which I've heard a lot of good things about,
2786520	2790200	although I have not unfortunately picked this title up myself yet.
2790200	2796000	And lastly but not leastly, I love this title on the Nintendo DS, this is a great title,
2796000	2798300	The Frog Man Show comes out.
2798300	2799500	That's the best ever.
2799500	2802280	On the Nintendo DS.
2802280	2808520	And it looks to be, they say it's an action game, but it looks like kind of like a bunch
2808520	2809520	of different little mini games.
2809520	2811080	It looks like another one of those types of games.
2811080	2813280	We should have action mini games.
2813280	2815080	Action based mini games.
2815080	2816520	That's it for Japanese releases.
2816520	2821560	Well, moving over to the UK, we have some stuff.
2821560	2826800	On the 23rd, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, Trials and Tribulations, 26 Aqua Team Hunger
2826800	2832800	4 Zombie Ninja Pro-Am, I think that's the best name ever.
2832800	2839800	On the 26th, Castlevania, The Dracula X Chronicles, Clive Barker's Jericho, Coded Arms Contagion,
2839800	2846400	Escape from Paradise City on PC, I'm sorry on PSP, Escape from Paradise City on PC, Jackass
2846400	2852080	the Game on PSP, Juice 2, Hot in Fortnite, King of Clubs, Metroid Prime 3, Corruption
2852080	2860040	on Wii, NBA 2K8, NBA Live 08, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Portal on Playstation 3, Pro Evolution
2860040	2866960	Soccer 2008 on a bunch of stuff, Stranglehold, Siphon Filter Dark Mirror, Team Fortress 2,
2866960	2874240	The Sims 2 Castaway, The Witcher on PC, Retro Fighter 5, Who the Hell Cares, Wipe Out Pulse
2874240	2877920	on PSP, and Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on PSP.
2877920	2880560	All right, awesome.
2880560	2889920	Well, in un-gaming release news, apparently this week they've been having some interesting
2889920	2893640	guests on The Morning Show here in the U.S. and...
2893640	2896200	Okay, first off, what the hell's The Morning Show?
2896200	2897200	I've never heard of that.
2897200	2898200	Is that like a...
2898200	2900080	That's not The Today Show or anything.
2900080	2901640	No, it's The Morning Show.
2901640	2902640	I've never heard of it.
2902640	2903640	I've never heard of it either.
2903640	2904640	All right.
2904640	2908820	Anyways, apparently The Morning Show, I have no idea who that is, features such wonderful
2908820	2917200	guests as Voldemort and apparently this wonderful woman who goes to bash Halo 3, and actually
2917200	2922560	I guess just violent games in general, Susan Bartell, she apparently says, when kids play
2922560	2928280	violent video games, we can see that their brains are different than when they play non-violent
2928280	2930280	games.
2930280	2934800	We can see a very big difference in their brains, which tells us how dangerous these
2934800	2939440	games can be.
2939440	2944520	Just an FYI, according to Wikipedia, The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet is mostly on Fox
2944520	2946720	and my network TV stations.
2946720	2949160	It's syndicated.
2949160	2951280	Yay!
2951280	2957520	So basically, they're saying that, I guess she wrapped the whole segment up by saying
2957520	2963960	they're going to react in the same highly aroused, angry way that we saw what happened
2963960	2964960	yesterday.
2964960	2969040	Of course, they were talking about a school shooting that happened in Cleveland that she
2969040	2970440	was referencing back to that.
2970440	2975400	Well, here's the interesting thing about that though, you see, because Game Politics
2975400	2980640	actually went and asked her about that because they had some issues with it.
2980640	2987640	One of the things that they found concerning, I guess, was a comment when they saw the Indiana
2987640	2992680	University brain scan pick five minutes before the airing of the show.
2992680	2998600	So she had looked at basically the brain scan image literally minutes before the show started
2998600	3003960	and they're saying, well, how can you base your professional opinion on just a brief
3003960	3005460	glance at it?
3005460	3012840	And she was saying, well, it's not concrete proof, but that doesn't change anything, blah,
3012840	3013840	blah, blah.
3013840	3020160	And they're saying that maybe it was a little bit sensationalized because it's on TV and
3020160	3021160	stuff.
3021160	3025120	So they understand how you feel, there's an element of sensationalism to it, I suppose.
3025120	3030440	I couldn't five minutes before going on air say, sorry, I won't do it.
3030440	3033480	I don't have enough background information about this brain scan.
3033480	3035480	I'm not that much of a purist.
3035480	3038840	So basically she was talking out of her ass.
3038840	3039840	Awesome.
3039840	3045600	And then the follow up with the whole thing, Game Politics, also ran another story about,
3045600	3052240	I guess is being reported in Scientific America, Richard Tremblay, a professor of pediatrics,
3052240	3060320	psychiatry and psychology said that kids were aggressive before modern media came along.
3060320	3064320	So we can't blame modern media for kids being aggressive.
3064320	3071560	Well, then again, wasn't there the study on how underage crime decreased?
3071560	3074680	People just want to blame something because they don't want to cop up to shit.
3074680	3075780	That's all it is.
3075780	3080000	And I hate when they get these experts out there that start blah, blah, blah, blah.
3080000	3084000	They tell someone what they want to hear and then they invite them on all these shows.
3084000	3085000	All right.
3085000	3088680	You know I got to get some chat room feedback because you know they are lit up on this story.
3088680	3093360	Kiki says, I did a report on video games and violence for school and in my research found
3093360	3097600	that only violent kids get violent in games.
3097600	3101960	Blaze says, couldn't various games cause the same brain scan read?
3101960	3108120	Darkshy wants to know why are all school shootings blamed on video games and GS68 is wondering
3108120	3113080	since we call Tack Jompson because we don't want to call him by name and he's effectively
3113080	3116640	banned from the show, since we call him Lord Voldemort, just in case you're first time
3116640	3121160	listening and you wonder who the hell is Voldemort, it's you know that guy, that lawyer guy that
3121160	3127400	needs to SDF you, GS68 is wondering should we call this lady Bellatrix Lestrange?
3127400	3135820	To be honest, I don't think she's going to be randomly posting on different websites
3135820	3141200	about shit making threats and acting purely crazy.
3141200	3145040	So I don't think we really need to worry about calling her anything else since obviously
3145040	3147000	she's going to be out of the news.
3147000	3149000	We should call her loser.
3149000	3152720	You know what, I agree with what Shadow Charlie said and honestly I think this just pretty
3152720	3153840	much sums up our feedback.
3153840	3158400	Shadow Charlie in our chatroom says she can shut the fuck up.
3158400	3164980	She really can and you know people like this just get our anger going and our blood boiling.
3164980	3169360	You knew, you knew when you read this story on Game Politics or wherever you might have
3169360	3173840	seen it earlier this week, you knew that on this program, this segment would be following
3173840	3176620	a story about this stupid, stupid woman.
3176620	3193680	It's the FUs of the week.
3193680	3201700	My FU of the week goes towards certain things at my place of employment without getting
3201700	3210680	into too much detail about what I do for a living, I work a job that they assign tasks
3210680	3215800	to me that I'm supposed to have done within a certain number of days, right?
3215800	3219200	And on average I do about 70 to 80 a day.
3219200	3227040	So I come in one day and there's 600 and something of them and so I closed 110 that day which
3227040	3229040	is a lot more than I usually do.
3229040	3232640	I came back the next day, there were 704.
3232640	3233940	I closed 90 that day.
3233940	3238200	I came back in, there were 780.
3238200	3241520	So yeah.
3241520	3247640	I have a right to complain about this because if I don't finish enough of it within my turnaround
3247640	3250560	time then it comes back and I get dinged for it.
3250560	3260440	So don't be surprised when certain things happen, is all I'm going to say.
3260440	3264360	Oh yeah and every time I try to apply for another position at work I'm written up for
3264360	3265360	something.
3265360	3266360	Hmm.
3266360	3270680	Alright, Loki, let loose, FUs of the week.
3270680	3276160	Fuck you to Kanye West for ruining Harder Better Faster Stronger by Daft Punk and trying
3276160	3282440	to claim, I guess make his own song by sampling that entire thing.
3282440	3286640	He's awful as an artist to begin with and I also watched Saturday Night Live, they had
3286640	3290280	another song that he did where he sampled Pretty Young Thing from Michael Jackson.
3290280	3293480	Once again an unoriginal bastard who needs to fucking die.
3293480	3299180	I mean he has no talent and I hate people that fucking sample shit, you know.
3299180	3305900	Also looking at you Black Eyed Peas, you fucking suck too so FU the both of them.
3305900	3312160	My FU of the week goes to children that go to Disneyland because kids ruin Disneyland
3312160	3313160	seriously.
3313160	3317520	Let's see what else, so what if supposedly Disneyland is for them.
3317520	3319200	I say they ruin it.
3319200	3324380	Also FU to the blaring hot sun, it's like October and in LA the sun was shining like
3324380	3330240	so horribly, it was horrible, so I want to say FU to that and FU to the fact that my
3330240	3332560	vacation is over and I have to go back to work tomorrow.
3332560	3335400	That sucks.
3335400	3337480	That's it though for the FUs of the week.
3337480	3344360	Let's get back into some news and I'll start it off with a story about Nintendo and guess
3344360	3351120	what Nintendo has decided that much like Sega's done recently with the Dreamcast, Nintendo
3351120	3357480	will be ending all hardware support for the Famicom, Super Famicom, Nintendo 64, Game
3357480	3360240	Boy and Game Boy Pocket.
3360240	3365360	The reason they're citing, rarity and scarcity of repair parts.
3365360	3370120	Now when I first read this I was actually surprised, they've still been repairing Famicoms
3370120	3375760	this long, but apparently they were and unfortunately now it is over.
3375760	3380860	Again this is just Nintendo of Japan but still, you know, dude seriously if you have a broken
3380860	3385320	Nintendo now go out and buy something else, I mean seriously, why are you still playing
3385320	3386320	Nintendo?
3386320	3387600	Bad news for retro collectors though.
3387600	3390840	I wonder though if, well you know that means that the prices of these systems are going
3390840	3398360	to go up because to use pinball as a comparison, for machines that start seeing revivals when
3398360	3403600	you can start getting parts for them again, the price of the tables goes down but when
3403600	3409040	they stop making the replacement plastics and stuff for some of the other tables, the
3409040	3410440	value jumps up by at least $5,000.
3410440	3413880	To be honest a lot of people that are collecting these retro systems anyways probably know
3413880	3418600	how to fix them or if they don't know how to fix them, know of somebody who can fix
3418600	3419600	them.
3419600	3423560	There are other websites or have extras or there are other people out there that know
3423560	3426640	how to fix these systems, it's not just Nintendo.
3426640	3430160	Here's a thought, I bet this is why they're ending the support now.
3430160	3435360	Why would they want to encourage people to buy the games at garage sales and stuff on
3435360	3439160	these old systems when they have this brand spanking new virtual console that's delivering
3439160	3440840	all the games from these old consoles?
3440840	3444880	This is why they're ending support now, I'll bet you.
3444880	3445880	Just a thought.
3445880	3447680	I think it's just because of what they actually said.
3447680	3449440	No I think I'm right and you're wrong.
3449440	3453240	Well I mean Game Boy Color, we don't see any Game Boy Color stuff on fucking...
3453240	3454240	Yet.
3454240	3455240	Yet.
3455240	3456240	Oh come on.
3456240	3458240	It would look like shit.
3458240	3465140	This is my theory behind it, why waste manpower on something the company itself has decided
3465140	3472280	was obsolete when they can focus towards their current thing and it's sort of like paying
3472280	3475960	somebody to fix a Betamax, you know?
3475960	3480600	I kind of buy that, that makes sense to me, but at the same time, why didn't they do that
3480600	3482360	ten years ago with the Famicom?
3482360	3483360	You know?
3483360	3484840	I mean Famicom's been out like twenty years.
3484840	3488120	But ten years ago I think that they still had a big enough user base, because ten years
3488120	3490520	ago, what was it that we were seeing out?
3490520	3495320	I was still playing my Super Nintendo, I think the N64 had just been out.
3495320	3497560	Because the Famicom's still probably outselling the PlayStation 3?
3497560	3502680	And on top of that, the only way you could get any of your retro games is to either own
3502680	3505600	the old system or to play on emulators.
3505600	3510960	But now we have it to where all these games are being re-released on, you know, we have
3510960	3517680	Virtual Console, we have Xbox Live Arcade, and so they're looking at it as progress.
3517680	3523200	What's the point now when they can get the same thing on one of our more up-to-date systems?
3523200	3526040	So why should they waste the support and manpower and product?
3526040	3531080	Well if they make some systems actually put on the market, you know, so we can buy them
3531080	3533320	to replace our broken Famicom.
3533320	3538000	Maybe that's why they gotta pull the old support, get some people on the assembly line.
3538000	3544840	And to go back to my, I guess, analogy to the Betamax, you know, you can't get Sony
3544840	3548120	to replace your Betamax machine, but you can go to specialty repair shops and they'll do
3548120	3549120	it.
3549120	3550120	It's gonna be the same way with old systems.
3550120	3551120	Alright.
3551120	3555600	Wow, I didn't think we'd have this much conversation over this story, this was just supposed to
3555600	3557280	be a little niche piece, but very interesting.
3557280	3562320	I guess we all in the room feel very passionately about retro gaming, especially Dark Soccer
3562320	3565680	of course, we've got our classic game of the week coming up in just a little bit.
3565680	3566680	But first, more news!
3566680	3573760	Probably five people have heard of, anyway, virtual console stuff for the UK, wee!
3573760	3580320	So what we are seeing out this time is World Heroes, which was a Neo Geo game.
3580320	3585880	Not really one of my favorite fighters, but it was pretty, pretty good, and it's 900 points.
3585880	3591440	And then coming up is a Gate of Thunder from the TurboGrafx-16.
3591440	3597980	It was made by Hudson, and that was a pretty damn good game, where you have your ship called
3597980	3602280	the Hunting Dog, and you are saving the starlight power.
3602280	3606800	But I think that it's cool because the planet referred to as planet Ares, and I'm an Ares,
3606800	3607800	so that's cool.
3607800	3608800	It's 800 points.
3608800	3614580	And, and then, and for anyone who watches the Angry Nintendo Nerd, you'll know where
3614580	3617760	my frustration with this game comes from for exactly the same reason he did.
3617760	3624400	Castlevania II, Simon's Quest for the NES, where, you know, it turns night time, and
3624400	3628400	then it turns day time, and then you can't save your game, and you have to start over
3628400	3632600	from the beginning, and you lose all your shit, and oh my god that game is frustrating,
3632600	3634400	and then Dracula's like, butt easy.
3634400	3637480	Yeah, I remember that too, that was crazy.
3637480	3642000	Now wait, since she's doing dates in the UK, I don't recall we've gotten Simon's Quest
3642000	3644000	in the US yet, right?
3644000	3650360	I don't think, that's a frickin' awesome game though, despite the frustration, I love the
3650360	3655400	game, and honestly, the music is half of what makes that game, so I'm hoping it's over here
3655400	3656640	on Monday.
3656640	3661120	I would like to see us get the Japanese version of Castlevania III.
3661120	3663080	What was the difference between that and this one, I don't...
3663080	3667440	It was certain gameplay factions that they took out, like for example, if you use the,
3667440	3670360	oh god I can't remember his name now, the guy who used the dagger?
3670360	3671360	Grant.
3671360	3672360	Grant, yes.
3672360	3676200	In the Japanese version, he would throw the dagger, and so it gave you range of attack
3676200	3677200	with him.
3677200	3678200	Hmm.
3678200	3680280	Yeah, that's just one of the things I remember.
3680280	3684520	I always like to use Alucard, because he can turn into the bat.
3684520	3686200	I like Grant, because he can climb on walls.
3686200	3688760	I guess that's true, and then there was the guy that had the orbs, right?
3688760	3689760	I don't even remember.
3689760	3690760	That was Saifa.
3690760	3691760	Wow.
3691760	3692760	That's old school.
3692760	3693760	Yeah.
3693760	3694760	Alright.
3694760	3696960	Oh, by the way, that's 500 points.
3696960	3700960	Tigerclaw would like to point out Dark Sakura, also the fact that it had two different endings,
3700960	3702800	and one of them, Simon Belmont, dies.
3702800	3703800	Yes.
3703800	3704800	That was the other thing.
3704800	3710560	I've played the disc version of it, luckily I've played a disc version of it, and the
3710560	3713880	music was also a little bit different, but then again, the disc games had a different
3713880	3714880	music processor.
3714880	3716800	I was going to say, didn't they have an extra sound channel in Japan?
3716800	3717800	Yeah.
3717800	3718800	For that stuff?
3718800	3719800	Yeah.
3719800	3722200	I think I remember one of my old roommates, who was really into collecting games, had
3722200	3725240	the old, old Castlevania III, and that was part of the reason.
3725240	3727600	That was the first time I had played it, though.
3727600	3731680	I played a disc one later on than that, but he brought it over to my house.
3731680	3732680	Ah.
3732680	3733680	I never played it.
3733680	3734680	Yeah.
3734680	3735680	Yep.
3735680	3736680	Alright.
3736680	3742240	Well, soon enough, GameTap will be hitting 1,000 games, and they're supposed to hit this
3742240	3747320	wonderful landmark achievement on November 15th.
3747320	3751160	But in the meantime, they will be getting some pretty cool stuff this week, including
3751160	3753760	Clive Barker's Jericho.
3753760	3758760	And the Sam & Max Season 2 will be starting here pretty soon, on November 8th, with Ice
3758760	3767640	Station Santa, and I guess Season 1's episode, Abe Lincoln Must Die, I guess is available
3767640	3769440	free right now.
3769440	3776440	Mr. Uru Online's final episode in the Season 1 story arc will begin the 1st of November,
3776440	3782040	and let's see here, I guess now the first three Hitman games will be free to play for
3782040	3787080	the non-subscribers, as that part of kind of a free game sampling that they have there
3787080	3789080	that's ad-supported.
3789080	3795280	And I guess a new season of Revisioned, which before was looking at Lara Croft, Davin said
3795280	3800720	which character we're going to do this time, or which series, and then game trailers for
3800720	3801720	various games.
3801720	3802720	Alright.
3802720	3803720	Sounds like fun.
3803720	3809400	I keep neglecting to go back to GameTap and checking out some of those other new games
3809400	3810400	that they have, like Blast Miner.
3810400	3813600	I wanted to check, because now they're starting to put out the indie games, too, and I'm pretty
3813600	3817640	sure Blast Miner finally made its way to GameTap, so I gotta check out some of the indie stuff
3817640	3819400	they have on there.
3819400	3824240	I still wish, though, they have Civilization III up in their archives, but they don't have
3824240	3825600	Civ I.
3825600	3829040	And I, for whatever reason, and I know I've gone into this tirade on the show before,
3829040	3834440	so I'll keep it short tonight, but I prefer Civilization I, the old school one, compared
3834440	3837080	to any other Civ they've released since then.
3837080	3842720	So Sid Meier, if you happen to be listening, please let them have Civilization on GameTap.
3842720	3846980	Also I would love you if you'd let them have Covert Action, because that was like my favorite
3846980	3850960	Sid Meier game ever, and probably nobody's ever heard of it.
3850960	3859280	Anyhow, speaking of games that you can download quickly, of course we all know the WiiWare
3859280	3863320	is coming out very soon, and one game people are very excited about on the WiiWare is the
3863320	3864320	Final Fantasy game.
3864320	3869600	It's the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Little King in the Promised Country.
3869600	3875880	This game is going to be out March 2008 in Japan, and it's going to be priced at 1,500
3875880	3879760	Wii Points, which of course would be $15 here in the US.
3879760	3883320	So at least this gives you some type of idea to what kind of pricing you're probably going
3883320	3886900	to see for the WiiWare, although not too much of a surprise.
3886900	3890880	This is pretty competitive with the Xbox Live pricing, because you consider a game like
3890880	3895960	Luminous was also $15, a Final Fantasy game is going to be definitely an A-list title
3895960	3900080	for the service, so it's not too surprising that they're going to want to charge $15 for
3900080	3901080	that.
3901080	3902560	Although actually Luminous got a price cut recently, didn't it?
3902560	3903560	It's only $10 now.
3903560	3904560	Not this week.
3904560	3905560	Yeah.
3905560	3907560	So there you have it.
3907560	3910800	Looking forward to getting more information on the game, all we know so far is that there
3910800	3916060	is a main character named the Little King, and he creates towns to basically build up
3916060	3917060	a new country.
3917060	3922640	He uses special powers to make elemental skills, and basically this is all used to develop
3922640	3923640	the land.
3923640	3926480	So it almost sounds like it's some type of sim game, because you get...
3926480	3928320	It's like one half of Actraiser.
3928320	3929320	Dirty work.
3929320	3930720	Hey, no problem with that.
3930720	3931720	I freaking love Actraiser.
3931720	3932720	You know what?
3932720	3936480	I think if I had a kid, I'd name him Little King.
3936480	3939680	Son of Dad says, Wii needs a hard drive bad.
3939680	3944680	Yeah, I am curious how, yeah, I am also curious how the Wii is going to fit all this stuff
3944680	3945680	in here.
3945680	3948120	I wouldn't be surprised, Nintendo's going to come out sometime next year.
3948120	3950280	That's what the SD cards are for.
3950280	3951280	Not just that.
3951280	3954880	They're going to come out at some point, and they're going to say, we have this super hidden
3954880	3959160	expansion port thing, and we're bringing out this thing.
3959160	3963920	If you invert your Wii, you'll find the port hidden somewhere on the system of the board.
3963920	3967160	Well, there are expansion ports that aren't being used on there right now, right?
3967160	3968160	Or USB, right?
3968160	3969160	Hell, if you...
3969160	3970160	It's got USB connections.
3970160	3971160	Yeah, it does have USB.
3971160	3974520	Hell, if you even wanted to get crazy with it, you could have something that plugs into
3974520	3979240	like the memory card slots and the controller ports or something, and it just expands on
3979240	3982480	the top where the GameCube stuff is, plugs in that, and has additional storage.
3982480	3983480	I don't know.
3983480	3984480	Whatever.
3984480	3985480	They can get crazy.
3985480	3986480	It'd probably be USB.
3986480	3987480	That would be the change.
3987480	3989480	I'm kind of irritated because they have all these hard drives that run on USB now, right?
3989480	3991960	I mean, like, I think I saw one at Target the other day.
3991960	3997120	Yeah, yeah, Jamie has one, but I've seen, now they even have new ones that are 500 gigabytes.
3997120	3999040	Five hundred gigabyte USB drive.
3999040	4000040	Mine's 500 gigabytes.
4000040	4001040	Is it really?
4001040	4002040	I thought you said it had like a 300 or something.
4002040	4003040	I paid 120 for it.
4003040	4004040	Oh, my God.
4004040	4005040	Oh, my gosh.
4005040	4009240	500 gigabytes for one of those things, and I can't, it's USB, but I can't hook it up
4009240	4013320	to my Wii, or I can't hook it up to my 360, and I can't, I mean, because of...
4013320	4017000	Because you know they're going to want you to use anything with their name on it so they
4017000	4018440	can market it and make money on it.
4018440	4020600	And I'm just saying that sucks.
4020600	4024080	Because seriously, what else am I going to fill up the 500 gigabytes with besides lots
4024080	4026200	of pornography, lots and lots of pornography?
4026200	4027200	They're going to find a way.
4027200	4028200	They're going to find a way.
4028200	4029200	Lots and lots.
4029200	4030200	I don't know.
4030200	4034240	It's quite a few Xbox 360 games quite easily.
4034240	4035240	In theory.
4035240	4036760	Next story, please.
4036760	4041960	Well, Mad Cats has decided that they're going to give their support to the National Breast
4041960	4052880	Cancer Foundation and release a pink tech pack for the DS Lite.
4052880	4059080	It will have accessories that have like a carry case, a power adapter for your car,
4059080	4066440	USB charge cable, two game cases, and two of the stylus pens.
4066440	4068720	So that's pretty cool.
4068720	4074200	And there's going to be a percentage from the purchase of this that's going to go toward,
4074200	4078160	you know, like I said, the National Breast Cancer Foundation and retail for $19.99.
4078160	4082040	Well, good for gaming and fundraising colliding.
4082040	4083040	That's a good thing.
4083040	4087280	Going back to the previous story in our chat room, chat.ownerswansradio.com, Rama is pointing
4087280	4092840	out you can get a one terabyte, that's 1,000 gigabytes, drive for $399.
4092840	4096480	And Sephiroth1215 says, yeah, I know someone who has a one terabyte drive.
4096480	4098440	What do you put on that?
4098440	4100960	I mean, that's a lot of porn.
4100960	4101960	That's a lot.
4101960	4103680	That's like a week's worth of porn.
4103680	4105680	That's what I was looking to buy was a terabyte.
4105680	4107320	They sell them at Fry's.
4107320	4108320	HD porn, even.
4108320	4113000	Do you know how much HD porn you could fit on a terabyte drive?
4113000	4115000	That's a lot.
4115000	4119720	The terabyte drives are something like 300 to 400 bucks, but iOmega makes one.
4119720	4122040	That's 300 to 400 hours of porn.
4122040	4123040	That's amazing.
4123040	4126120	Problem is, though, downloading that amount of porn, it would take lots of time.
4126120	4127120	That's true.
4127120	4131520	Well, the whole reason I bought mine was because, and now that it's happened, you know, like
4131520	4138080	I saw it coming, my PC was dying, so I bought my hard drive to save all my crap.
4138080	4141620	Zappy24 in chat says, a terabyte isn't as much as it seems.
4141620	4142840	It fills fast.
4142840	4145440	So you know who's been downloading the HD porn.
4145440	4146440	Just teasing.
4146440	4147440	Just teasing.
4147440	4152900	Actually, what was taking up most of mine was, I was, I have entire seasons of Doctor
4152900	4158420	Who and Stargate, because, you know, I don't watch TV.
4158420	4165400	Which is borderline porn for you, because every time you see David Tennant, like, you
4165400	4168000	get a fem boner or whatever they're called.
4168000	4169000	Fan-gasm.
4169000	4170000	Sure, a fan-gasm.
4170000	4171000	Fan-gasm.
4171000	4172000	Okay.
4172000	4173000	A girl boner.
4173000	4174440	A girl boner.
4174440	4177880	So one thing that really shouldn't collide, but for some reason this year has been colliding
4177880	4184200	more than I would like, would be baby raising sims for the DS.
4184200	4188220	And yet another one has come along, Crave Entertainment's Baby Pals, which should be
4188220	4195360	coming out in November, if I remember correctly, is a baby washing, dressing, and patty caking
4195360	4196360	sim.
4196360	4200320	It's basically Nintendogs with babies.
4200320	4205600	You have to adopt a pet human, then feed it, bathe it, dress it in funny clothes.
4205600	4213200	You can even teach it to walk, talk, though if you do, was that the first thing?
4213200	4217160	This is also from another article here, their comment was, though if you get them to do
4217160	4222100	these things, they're probably saying, why the hell am I wearing these funny clothes?
4222100	4226680	One thing though they're asking in this article, which is kind of funny, is, so if you ignore
4226680	4230520	your Nintendogs, they run away and stuff.
4230520	4232760	The babies run away.
4232760	4235960	A baby's hitchhiking to Texas.
4235960	4243440	If you ignore your baby, does virtual social services rep come and take them away?
4243440	4248240	If you ignore your baby, then Child Protective Services comes and takes your baby away?
4248240	4249240	That was their joke.
4249240	4250520	I don't think that's actually what's going to happen.
4250520	4251520	Oh my God, I wish.
4251520	4254040	How would that be any different than the reality for some people?
4254040	4256920	I was going to say, if you're Britney Spears, you might be able to benefit from this game.
4256920	4263960	I love the picture they have on this, this Wired blog thing, it says, baby spotted you.
4263960	4264960	It's creepy looking.
4264960	4270480	But yeah, baby pals will be coming out for the DS in November, in a big block of stuff
4270480	4274140	that they have, like all the Pet Series and Sim Raising shit.
4274140	4278000	So there's Imagine Babies and Baby Pals so far, and I'm pretty sure there's going to
4278000	4279000	be another one.
4279000	4282500	Now, Loki, I know you've said you and the wife are thinking about having a baby in the
4282500	4284160	not too distant future, right?
4284160	4286880	So are you going to use this game as like a training?
4286880	4287880	Is this something maybe you can...
4287880	4288960	I should make her play this.
4288960	4293680	You should buy it for Nellie, because I don't know where you're at on that one and have
4293680	4294720	a baby thing.
4294720	4298960	But if maybe you want to hold off a little bit, I say buy this game for Nellie and make
4298960	4302280	sure that Child Protective Services doesn't take her Nintendbaby away.
4302280	4304240	I just want to buy this.
4304240	4310880	To me, this game poses the challenge of the Sims.
4310880	4314680	The Sims, you're supposed to make the family thrive and yadda, yadda, yadda, but all I
4314680	4317200	want to do in the Sims is try to kill them.
4317200	4323200	So in Baby Pals, it's like, how can I possibly abuse these Sim babies?
4323200	4328760	I mean, just like in Nintendogs, you can kind of like, I don't know, throw the Frisbee at
4328760	4330880	their head and stuff.
4330880	4333880	It'd be fun.
4333880	4338040	Kiki just recently had a baby, apparently, and is saying, uh-huh, oh, she's born and
4338040	4340520	sitting on my lap listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4340520	4341520	Be careful.
4341520	4343700	That could be minus points for the baby.
4343700	4349200	That may be one step closer to CPS coming down, no, I'm just kidding.
4349200	4351600	Congratulations though, seriously.
4351600	4352760	New babies are fun.
4352760	4355080	When they're real babies, they're good things.
4355080	4358800	When they're Sim babies, they're stupid.
4358800	4361440	I have to say, I've met a good baby.
4361440	4362440	Yeah.
4362440	4365320	My friend Becky, her baby, quiet.
4365320	4366320	Well-behaved.
4366320	4373720	Yeah, Brihoma says the baby's going to ask, Mommy, what's a girl boner?
4373720	4374720	Wow.
4374720	4376720	Oh, cool, Deakman.
4376720	4382760	Oh, it's Deakman, okay, it's Deakman's partner.
4382760	4384400	Kiki's my girlfriend and that's my baby.
4384400	4385400	Oh, okay.
4385400	4387680	Oh, the whole family's listening to OLR together.
4387680	4392960	That's so- One, two, three, aww.
4392960	4395960	Wow.
4395960	4398720	Message to the baby, stop crying so much.
4398720	4400900	Mommy and Daddy value their sleep.
4400900	4401900	Just kidding.
4401900	4404840	All right, let's move on with some news.
4404840	4408600	Moving on to a completely different field here, MMOs.
4408600	4411440	You know, people love their MMOs.
4411440	4415800	The World of Warcraft is still dominating as always, but there's some other MMOs you
4415800	4417880	may not have heard about.
4417880	4425480	RF Online is creating an MMO and the MMO is called- I'm sorry, RF Online is the game.
4425480	4429160	It's actually being made by Codemasters.
4429160	4432900	RF Online is now a free game.
4432900	4438240	The game came out back in 2006, didn't really get noticed by a lot of people, but the game
4438240	4443880	is now completely free to download and play, no monthly subscription, and there is actually
4443880	4446160	a new content update with the game.
4446160	4452800	It's episode two, Pioneers of Novus, so they made the game completely free.
4452800	4456360	If you want to check this game out, I don't know, look at the screenshot, it looks a little
4456360	4461120	bit like Phantasy Star-ish to me because it looks like it's the real-time fighting, but
4461120	4465640	I couldn't tell you because I haven't played the game myself yet, but now that it's free,
4465640	4468300	I might just have the incentive to do that.
4468300	4473400	So check that out, it's RF-OnlineGame.com if you want more information.
4473400	4479080	Well, I have a little bit of information that will make lots and lots of people happy.
4479080	4481400	It makes me happy.
4481400	4485640	Nights has a date.
4485640	4491880	December 18th is going to be the release date for Night's Journey of Dreams, and in the
4491880	4496760	UK, well, actually it just says Europe in general, will be January is when the release
4496760	4501040	is, though there's not a specific date.
4501040	4505260	So sorry, Nights fans, but no Christmas for you overseas.
4505260	4508320	Did you watch the demo play for Nights?
4508320	4511080	I saw some screens, but I didn't watch the demo.
4511080	4513960	It's very, very, very cool.
4513960	4516440	I know you're a big fan of Nights.
4516440	4519560	Are you the one that told me Christmas Nights is one of your favorite games ever?
4519560	4523520	Well, we have a tradition in my house around Christmas, we break out the Saturn, make sure
4523520	4525120	the battery works.
4525120	4529040	Yeah, I lost all of my Symphony of the Night data.
4529040	4530480	I bet you were happy.
4530480	4533000	After I maxed out everything you can with Maria.
4533000	4534720	I bet you were very happy with that.
4534720	4535720	Oh, no.
4535720	4540880	But we play Christmas Nights every year, and we break out the Saturn in December, and we
4540880	4545360	play all the way through the dates, and the closer you get to Christmas, I think it's
4545360	4551000	really cool that certain, they change textures in it, they change the music, it starts snowing,
4551000	4555600	you get snow effects on the ground the closer you get to Christmas Day, and it's really
4555600	4556600	cool.
4556600	4557600	All right.
4557600	4559600	Well, maybe they'll do something like that with this.
4559600	4560600	And presents.
4560600	4561600	Maybe they'll do that here.
4561600	4562600	You can play memory.
4562600	4563600	All right.
4563600	4564600	Anyhow.
4564600	4567240	Anyways, so something really cool is actually kind of going on here.
4567240	4573720	The folks over at Ain't It Cool News are putting together a reunion screening for what they
4573720	4579400	call the greatest video game related yet not a video game based film of all time.
4579400	4582300	And of course that film is The Wizard.
4582300	4589640	It is going to be shown at Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas on December 7th.
4589640	4592580	Tickets go on sale on November 5th.
4592580	4600300	And are available on the Alamo Drafthouse's website or www.drafthouse.com.
4600300	4604600	If you're in the area and want to go to the screen, be sure to pick up a ticket.
4604600	4610520	In attendance will be, let's see here, Fred Savage, director Todd Holland.
4610520	4611840	Wow.
4611840	4617760	And let's see, Luke Edwards also will be there.
4617760	4622840	And apparently the guy that played Lucas will not be there.
4622840	4626960	I love the Power Glove.
4626960	4628960	It's so bad.
4628960	4636080	Yeah, well, just keep your Power Gloves off her, pal, huh?
4636080	4638760	Why is it that America loves The Wizard?
4638760	4640800	He grew up cute.
4640800	4641800	Fred Savage?
4641800	4642800	Yeah.
4642800	4645040	Didn't you see he was in the doctor...
4645040	4646320	He still has the same face.
4646320	4647880	He was in the Austin Powers movie as the mole.
4647880	4654640	He had a sitcom on NBC a while ago, too, so anyway.
4654640	4659040	What is it about The Wizard that people still love to this day?
4659040	4660600	It's just The Wizard.
4660600	4665840	I think it has a very Rocky Horror-ish element to it with the video game crowd, because of
4665840	4668840	course, those that know me know that I still love me some Rocky Horror Picture Show, and
4668840	4672600	part of that is because the whole crowd gets into it and has fun with it.
4672600	4675940	And I think that's kind of where The Wizard is headed, not that I'm saying people are
4675940	4680200	going to dress up and act out the thing, although they might, I mean, I don't know.
4680200	4685000	But I could imagine that when this scene comes up in the movie, people are going to start
4685000	4689600	cheering and they're going to yell back, and all the girls are going to scream at that,
4689600	4693040	oh, he touched my breast part, and all that stuff.
4693040	4696440	It just has that campiness to it that's very fun.
4696440	4700200	But I'm glad to hear that Fred Savage is going and has a good sense of humor about it.
4700200	4704040	I wish they were doing this in more places than just Austin.
4704040	4709040	If they can do midnight showings of Showgirls, surely they could put The Wizard in San Francisco
4709040	4710040	for one night and people would come out.
4710040	4712040	Could you imagine having a shadow cast for The Wizard?
4712040	4715480	I don't even want to think about it.
4715480	4718640	There's other movies I'd rather see that done to.
4718640	4723960	Tiger Claw says, people love The Wizard because it's filled with so much Nintendo propaganda.
4723960	4728240	Rama in chat says, The Wizard ranks right up there with UHF, it's a cult classic.
4728240	4731920	UHF is what I was proposed to over.
4731920	4734280	Rama said also, it's a cult classic.
4734280	4738440	It's when they revealed Super Mario Brothers 3, and I think a lot of us remember that from
4738440	4739440	our childhood.
4739440	4743880	Like, a lot of us went to go see the movie just to freakin' see Mario 3.
4743880	4744880	Me too.
4744880	4745880	Wow.
4745880	4746880	That's hardcore.
4746880	4749840	I'm providing a shopping service for our listeners in the chat room.
4749840	4750840	What shopping service?
4750840	4754080	Yeah, people saying, I want a Saturn, and I was like, you want a Saturn?
4754080	4756880	You can buy one off eBay.
4756880	4759600	Use your hard-earned money to buy something off eBay right now.
4759600	4760600	I have two Saturns.
4760600	4763080	If you want something bad enough, you'll make it happen.
4763080	4767520	I have a Saturn that I'm willing to get rid of because it has no controllers and no cords
4767520	4768520	or anything.
4768520	4769520	I'll take it.
4769520	4770520	I've got a bajillion controllers and cords.
4770520	4771520	Wow.
4771520	4773720	That'll be three Saturns in my house.
4773720	4774720	I need a Saturn.
4774720	4777720	I've never, I've barely played any Saturn games in my life.
4777720	4779200	That's what I need to play on a Saturn.
4779200	4780200	I think I have that.
4780200	4781200	The stall is awesome.
4781200	4784520	Do you want to just borrow an extra set of controllers and cords for me?
4784520	4787760	Well, I have, I have, my first Saturn has all the stuff for it.
4787760	4788760	Oh.
4788760	4789760	You don't have the second one.
4789760	4790760	Yeah.
4790760	4794160	Because I went to Denio's, you know, local flea market over here, and the first one I
4794160	4798840	saw was the Saturn without anything because the guy was selling it for like 20 bucks.
4798840	4800160	I'm like, okay, I'll take it.
4800160	4801160	You went to Trader Dan's, right?
4801160	4804960	I don't remember, but then I went somewhere else and I found a Saturn with everything.
4804960	4807960	I'm like, okay, well, I'll just have a spare one, get parts or something.
4807960	4808960	Yeah.
4808960	4811520	Of course, you have to replace your battery every month.
4811520	4812520	Wow.
4812520	4817760	Well, now we're getting all nostalgic, and what better time than to bring out Dark Sakura's
4817760	4819520	classic game of the week.
4819520	4820520	Yes, that's right.
4820520	4824320	Part A is coming to an end, and this is the part of the show where we like to let Dark
4824320	4829040	Sakura reminisce a little bit about games you may have missed, and I honestly think
4829040	4832160	damn near everyone missed this game Dark Sakura's going to do this week.
4832160	4836720	I'm kind of excited to hear a little more about it, so I will stop the suspense, cue
4836720	4841480	the music, and let Dark Sakura take it away.
4841480	4853200	Today's classic game slash obscure slash whatever game I pick of the week is Magical Fantasy
4853200	4854800	Adventure Popful Mail.
4854800	4857080	Wow, that's a mouthful.
4857080	4858080	Yeah.
4858080	4869120	It was released originally on the PC-98 and PC-88 system in Japan, and it's sort of like
4869120	4874080	Ys, you side scroll adventure, it has RPG elements, you can change out your weapons,
4874080	4880320	you can change out your items, and talk to people, and all the stuff.
4880320	4887080	It was released in Japan afterwards on Super Famicom, on PC Engine CD, and on the Mega
4887080	4892120	CD, and over here we actually got the Sega CD version thanks to working delays, I mean
4892120	4894400	working designs.
4894400	4901240	Working designs are also the lovely people that brought Silhouette Mirage, the Grow Lancer
4901240	4908720	series, Lunar, they were very, very good to us.
4908720	4914320	So in this game you were playing a little busty elven girl called Popful, no, called
4914320	4924400	Mail, and you play as her friends, and you go around trying to, you know, save things,
4924400	4928600	her friend the sorcerer Tat, and the little dragon guy named Gal, and you fight bad guys
4928600	4932480	called Nutscracker and Muttonhead.
4932480	4933480	There's a guy named Nutscracker?
4933480	4934480	Nutscracker.
4934480	4937640	I don't know if I like this guy.
4937640	4939440	And it's a pretty cool game.
4939440	4944000	Who's this that Mail's talking to right now in our little clip we're playing in the background?
4944000	4949000	This is like the very start of the game, someone who's just cutting it out.
4949000	4953960	Say, why don't you take me with you, I bet you have lots of adventures, why else would
4953960	4954960	you have such a huge soul?
4954960	4957440	I love the huge anime eyes and smile.
4957440	4958440	Excuse me?
4958440	4961040	I'm so hungry, I can eat an okra.
4961040	4964520	I think you're confused, I'm a bounty hunter, not a baby cheer bub.
4964520	4970240	Well the old CD games never had good music with them, or I mean good voice acting music
4970240	4971240	was really good.
4971240	4975080	Actually the voice acting wasn't really too bad, they at least tried.
4975080	4979240	The problem I had with working designs is that they would put stuff into the game that
4979240	4984520	just was not there and usually kind of crass humor, like with Rayearth.
4984520	4990000	Now they actually made improvements when they brought out Rayearth on Saturn, but they took
4990000	4996000	out the fact that they speak dialogue every time you touch an item, which cut down on
4996000	4999360	the, it had intense loading time on the game.
4999360	5007920	But they put in all these jokes like there was one about Harry Palms, but this was a
5007920	5010920	fun game, it was a lot of fun.
5010920	5020720	And it had the classic cut scenes and it's just very mid 90s game fun, that's all I can
5020720	5021720	say it is.
5021720	5026720	And I actually was surprised with my copy because I had played it back in the day when
5026720	5031000	a friend of mine had imported it.
5031000	5035500	And then it got its US release and I never, I didn't have a Sega CD at the time so I never
5035500	5037000	actually got it.
5037000	5042340	And one day Dan came home with this huge box for me to open at Christmas and inside this
5042340	5048880	huge box, it was supposed to be like a space heater, was my game at the bottom of the box.
5048880	5049880	How funny.
5049880	5052320	I actually own an original Popple meal now.
5052320	5053320	Awesome.
5053320	5055960	Well that's a good game of the week because I bet a lot of people miss that one, but some
5055960	5058720	folks in chat seem to recognize it and applaud that pick of the week.
5058720	5062100	Popple meal is your classic game of the week.
5062100	5066400	And with that part A comes to a close, but fear not, we'll be back in just a little bit
5066400	5071440	with part B. So stay tuned and thanks for downloading Orange Lounge Radio.
