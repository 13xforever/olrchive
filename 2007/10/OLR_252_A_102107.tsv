13945	26148	Tonight, October 21st, 2007, Street Fighter is back for more in SF4, Sega brings its characters to a new tennis game, and a classic video game movie returns to at least one big screen.
31465	36468	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36488	42312	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42732	43753	My name is Rob Roberts.
43933	48356	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48656	48876	Hi.
49336	50017	How are you doing, Jamie?
50497	50757	I'm here.
51258	51618	You're here.
52198	52718	I'm here too.
53259	54520	And we're here to talk about games.
54720	56441	Also joining us, the one and only Loki.
57421	57541	Hello.
57562	58942	How are you doing, Loki?
59203	59903	I'm doing fine.
60219	60879	Guitar Hero 3 Demo Kit
82113	87677	for Guitar Hero 360, except it's kind of rare because it is a wired version instead of wireless.
87897	88298	Interesting.
88518	93141	Not that I really give a damn if it's wireless or not, I mean, because that's one less battery I need, so.
93722	96204	Now, are we going to be unboxing that on Operator 11 a little later?
96404	96904	Yeah, sure why not.
96924	97605	All right, sounds good.
98174	99375	DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
127779	130100	Ragnarok What exactly does that mean in English?
153906	155907	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
183511	185773	Fire Mage, who I'm building up to Sage.
186493	187534	I have two Assassins.
188195	191317	One of them hit level 91 this week.
192839	193980	I have a bunch of other people.
194000	195441	Oh, I have a Dancer who looks like a Hoochie.
197162	197462	Fun.
197783	198023	Yeah.
198820	201080	DarkSakura and Korean MMOs
228618	239881	I would say, God, let me start off with, I played Conan on Xbox 360, and it's interesting.
240601	245302	It's actually very much of a ripoff of God of War, but that's not a bad thing.
245342	246622	It's still a pretty good game.
247603	253244	And let's see, I also tried, of course, Beautiful Katamari, and I actually finished that game because it's very short.
254451	258795	Um, I tried the, what else did I play here?
260276	262498	Um, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.
263058	264519	I tried the demo for that.
265420	268623	You know, it's a good looking game.
269624	270484	The cars look good.
270925	275068	The track that they picked though to showcase it, I wouldn't have picked that one.
275540	275880	Paper Dolls
303405	305746	I know Project Gotham does the same thing, but you know what?
305786	307786	Project Gotham looks way better.
308727	320130	This isn't really a huge deal right now because Project Gotham is only on 360, but a year from now when Project Gotham Racing 5 is probably going to be coming out and Gran Turismo 5 is coming out at the same time,
321112	322693	Project Gotham is a Microsoft IP Unlike Mass Effect
342304	343045	Project Gotham Racing
363732	366674	So, probably the PlayStation 3, it's going to be the same deal.
366934	377121	I'm just saying, you know, for them putting all this hype behind it and trying to even sell this kind of demo of a game before it comes out, you know, officially, I don't know.
377181	379102	It's not that great.
379162	387308	But if you're really dying to play some Gran Turismo, I highly recommend checking out the demo first and then judging it based off that, see if you want to buy it or not.
387568	388989	It looks good, but I just...
389853	397241	You know, after seeing the video, the video of it looked really, really nice, but when you're playing the game, it's not as nice, so I don't know.
399202	402706	I'm trying to think if there's anything else I played that was really awesome.
403707	408632	I think that's pretty much it, other than, you know, Saints Row, because I've always been playing Saints Row now.
408900	410741	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
431508	438769	There was just going to be huge crowds for all that stuff, and the media invites I was getting, not a lot of real wowing kind of stuff.
439250	445851	So I said, you know what, I'm going to just take a real vacation from both of my jobs, Orange Lounge Radio, my day job, and I'm going to go to Disneyland.
446171	452092	So I spent the week playing Buzz Lightyear once again, and I got the number 17 high score for the day one time I played.
452112	452852	I have a picture to prove it.
453752	456553	Anyway, no, but seriously, other video games I've been playing,
457446	464012	I did play Typing of the Dead before I left because I remember we had this story on the show a couple weeks ago where we were talking about how they added Typing of the Dead to GameTap.
464032	465053	I'm like, I've got to go play that.
465574	468857	And it's still as wonderful as I remember it.
468897	471580	It runs great on the computer, so I was very happy about that.
472340	478587	Even though it is the PC version that GameTap is emulating, not the Dreamcast version, but they still do have the Dreamcast strapped to their backs.
479087	481069	And that's the part we all know and love.
482240	491871	Also, a large majority of my gaming week otherwise was spent playing E4, the other E4, not the Expo, but Every Extend Extra Extreme, which came out on Xbox Live this week.
492850	494071	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
515172	518774	Your shields are only on for about two seconds once you regenerate.
519254	522015	After those two seconds are up, anything on the screen can kill you.
522375	525156	So you want to commit suicide before something on the screen kills you.
525456	528157	Because if something on the screen kills you, you basically have to go back to start.
528758	533560	The game time is limited to three minutes, but you can collect power-ups throughout the game.
533880	543484	You can collect a power-up to extend your game time, a power-up to extend your shield time, a power-up to make things float on the screen faster and increase the beats of the song.
543504	544484	That's what they call the quicken.
545200	557709	or you can pick a power up that increases your bonus multiplier and basically that's essentially the core component of the game so you know you get higher and higher bonuses if you actually detonate your ship in time to the music now it's a game by
558502	561864	Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who did Luminous and a bunch of other stuff I love.
562625	567448	And I played every cent extra on the PSP, so I knew I was going to like this game, and I do.
567508	568388	The game has a lot of depth.
568408	571210	It has the regular game mode, and then it has a shooter mode.
571270	575213	It's called the Revenge mode, where you can go around and actually just... It's just a shooter.
575713	577774	It doesn't even bother with the music or the exploding.
577834	578975	It just shoots things.
579495	580376	So that was kind of interesting.
580736	581757	But then there's another mode.
582521	606328	It's pretty intricate the way they set it up, but you can actually, using the whole media center and doing the MP3s on your Xbox 360 through the network, you can actually configure Every Extent Extra Extreme to read those songs, and you can work with the game to either auto-detect the BPM or set the BPM by button tapping or whatever, so you can use your own songs in the game, which is kind of cool.
606348	608649	It's kind of fun to be able to play the game with your own songs.
609130	609730	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
628010	633191	The game did not increment in stages, and I realized maybe that's a different game.
633211	644654	This wasn't necessarily supposed to be a direct port of the PSP version, but I kind of liked that better when there was that more sense of accomplishment as opposed to the fact of, I've survived for 70 minutes now and my thumbs are getting numb, so I'm just going to suicide, which is what I ended up doing.
646894	653856	The other thing that actually kind of makes me wonder why they chose to do this in the game is that the graphics aren't that good.
654822	656263	And I was kind of surprised.
656403	666287	Like, compared to the PSP version, which has these very bright visuals and different types of backgrounds and different skins, eh, I kind of felt that this game just had white on black.
666847	672229	And the types of objects that would float around the screen would change depending on what stage you were playing.
672910	676091	And the little ships that, you know, get into it as well.
676671	677591	That's really about it.
677651	679452	Like, the backgrounds don't change too much.
679512	681253	Granted, when you set off big combos...
681553	682434	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
708749	711071	After 70 minutes of playing one round of this game.
711551	713312	So it kind of didn't add up to a lot.
713332	714613	So that was a bit of a disappointment.
715113	718515	But overall, I think it is a good value for money, especially if you're not a PSP owner.
718896	719856	I think it is a fun game.
720617	723279	I did play a little bit of Luminous because they have the new content.
723599	728222	I neglected to download the holiday pack, but I did download the new Genkai Rocket song, Breeze.
729281	730281	Mediocre at best.
730521	745907	I did not enjoy Breeze, which is sad because I love, love, love, love, love Heavenly Star and I love the video, but Breeze is basically the same concept for the video, the cartoon Asian girl bouncing around, which makes sense because Genkai Rockets is supposed to be like a... Genki.
746267	746727	Genki, sorry.
747007	749588	It's supposed to be like a cartoony band or whatever it is.
750068	750708	You know, I don't know.
751309	752209	Cartoon heroes did it.
753988	756949	So did Gorillaz, but you know, it's just, at least, Gorillaz did it best.
757289	759029	There's different, well, you're a fangirl.
759289	762610	There's different, there's variants in the Gorillaz videos.
762750	763251	You know what I mean?
763471	764831	Like, their videos are all different.
765511	767532	Say what you will, like, dislike, all the videos are different.
767572	771633	Well, actually, actually, actually, the videos only got different when you got to Demon Days.
772393	774214	The first album ones were not different.
774374	776634	Well, they need to vary it up a little bit.
776674	783356	Well, I mean, they couldn't keep that level of, you know, I mean, Heavenly Star and, you know, Shinen were both really good, and, you know,
784198	786079	Eventually, they're going to have to have a mediocre song.
787499	789140	All right, going to chat room for some comments.
789220	790680	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
790720	795122	Picaruno says, the new seasonal Luminous Life Pack is awesome and you should buy it right now.
795942	798563	I've heard good things about it, so I'm contemplating buying it.
798583	798843	We'll see.
798884	802465	As long as I don't have any speed mixes of fucking Christmas songs.
802965	803645	Oh, yes, please no.
803665	804786	I'm looking at you, Dance Mania.
804806	806086	I'm looking at you.
806686	810848	Gerardimo says, they're trying to set you up with microtransactions like in Luminous.
811108	811528	Who knows?
811848	813489	Maybe that's where my backgrounds are.
814087	815968	There are going to be microtransactions later on.
815988	816668	Well, I refuse.
816709	819230	I'm putting my foot down this time on the microtransactions, damn it.
820010	821791	So you're paying less than a penny?
824473	832157	Well, look, I know we've had this discussion about micro and macrotransactions, but that's, you know, despite, it's still what people call it.
834479	836660	Gerardimo's also still having fun with the E4 demo.
838401	839882	DarkTetsuya says, Loki, what?
839962	841743	Speed Mix of Jingle Bells doesn't do it for you?
842083	842624	No, it doesn't.
843044	843364	It doesn't.
844369	849431	Alright, oh, GS68 would also like to point out, speeding up a song does not equal a remix.
850572	851092	Good point.
852313	854134	Alright, well that's going to do it for our gaming weeks.
854774	857655	But adding heavy synth to it does make it Eurobeat.
858335	858696	It might.
859516	862017	And, you know, having some guy singing about fire.
862177	865179	Whatever a fire, just insert blank of fire and it's instant Eurobeat.
865199	868240	Oh, we'll get into remix stuff later on.
868560	871221	I have some complaints with certain artists out there.
871381	872442	Oh my, alright.
873101	878706	Did I mention that Luminous does have, or I'm sorry, not Luminous, Every Stand Extra Extreme does have a remix of Heavenly Star in it.
880207	880828	It's not that great.
881168	881588	Sorry to say.
881608	882949	You probably have already heard it too.
883270	883510	Maybe.
884331	884571	All right.
885852	888154	Let's go into tonight's news.
888194	889595	We don't have a lot of housekeeping tonight.
890353	893114	I will therefore use the opportunity to plug our communities.
893614	895695	MySpace.com slash OrangeLaunchRadio.
895775	897175	Add us as your friend on MySpace.
897595	899216	We post bulletins with extra stuff.
899436	907338	We actually did a whole bonus show last week because of our outage after the show, and so we posted it to our MySpace people and the LiveJournal people at Orange Lounge.
907779	917647	We also have a community on Facebook, but I've been irritated with Facebook lately because I'm getting sick of getting the invites for So-and-so wants you to be on their team for quiz show.
918007	921050	So-and-so wants you to join them in the battle of ninjas versus pirates.
921130	925913	I'm like, this so-and-so doesn't give two shits and is thinking about deleting his account.
925933	929516	Did you hear that the Mass Effect characters are now on Facebook looking for friends?
929776	932238	I could give a shit, honestly.
932659	934320	I hope they find no friends on Facebook.
935234	936435	I am not happy with Facebook.
936455	946762	Facebook was cool like six months ago before they started adding all the... Like, you would think usually user-created mods are a good thing for almost everything you can think of.
947362	948383	Not Facebook.
949755	956278	Facebook is somehow proven that user-enabled created mods can single-handedly make your site suck balls.
956398	959460	Just like user-created themes for Myspace.
959880	962661	Now everybody's yelling at me to just block the applications.
962981	964322	Can I block everything?
964682	967103	Can I just put, is there like a box, block everything?
967563	968204	Maybe I'll do that.
968424	969564	I didn't even know that was a feature.
969825	970825	See, this is why I love chat.
971245	972226	Chat educates me.
972526	975867	In fact, I will check Facebook right now while we get into some gaming news.
976348	976988	So let's start off.
977637	983761	So during this week, there was a wonderful event in London, Capcom's Gamers Day.
984442	989565	And of course, their bombshell announcement for that event would be Street Fighter 4.
989765	991247	Oh my god, it's coming.
992267	994849	I mean, I'm not too surprised that there's a Street Fighter 4.
994989	997911	That's like saying there's not going to be a Halo 4 or something like that.
997971	998532	I mean, come on.
998992	1000873	But, okay, it is Street Fighter 4.
1001534	1003695	It's supposed to continue with the 2D series.
1003995	1006317	It's not going to be 3D, so far at least.
1007253	1007693	Thank God.
1008033	1008674	That's a good thing.
1020089	1022291	It was, I'm sorry, the teaser video was lame.
1022691	1027755	I mean, it was nothing more than like a hype the crowd type thing where I'm sitting there watching it on the computer.
1027795	1029456	I'm thinking, show me the game.
1029977	1034220	I hate these stupid cinematic, like teasers that are nothing but cinematics, the CGI rendering.
1034460	1037963	We're in a day and an age of gaming where we know that's just all the BS cut scenes.
1038283	1040045	Like, I want to see some actual game.
1040145	1045589	It would be awesome though if it was in that art style because it was kind of like a watercolor type thing, but no.
1046830	1046990	So.
1047403	1049428	Street Fighter 4, it's going to be a fighting game.
1049488	1053518	It'll probably be awesome and out sometime, someday.
1054681	1055142	Yay!
1056235	1059297	Now let's see, GS68 says nobody will play Street Fighter 4.
1059417	1062219	Arcade scene has been reduced down to initial D4.
1062680	1063000	And when?
1063020	1064361	Again, Midnight Maximum 2 and 3.
1064601	1066062	Oh, people will play Street Fighter 4.
1066342	1069024	Well, because they're not going to gun for the arcades necessarily.
1069224	1072226	They're going to use Xbox Live and PlayStation Network to get people to play.
1072246	1073367	People will still play the damn arcades.
1073387	1073908	I mean, come on.
1073948	1075369	People still play tech in there.
1075709	1076670	People still go to the arcades.
1076690	1078211	That's why there's still arcades out there.
1078231	1081433	There's not as many arcades because arcade games have gotten more expensive.
1081753	1084675	And if you don't have the foot traffic, you're not going to be able to pay for your $6,000 game.
1086096	1089358	So, that's why arcades are failing.
1089758	1095441	It's not because, you know, people stopped going to them, it's just that games got more expensive.
1096342	1102205	Out of curiosity, why would I bother to go to an arcade if I can just plug it in on my Xbox 360 and sign into live and play?
1102545	1105686	Because the D-pad sucks on Xbox 360.
1105786	1106407	Ouch, good point.
1107707	1108228	Touche.
1108268	1110149	What can ever replace the arcade experience?
1110976	1111556	That's true.
1111696	1116938	And I know this is interesting coming from me on this program when you consider the three of us all met, how?
1117078	1117938	At an arcade, right?
1118339	1125841	But, you know, arcades, as they're saying in chat, they really have become nothing but gambling for children and the ticket spitters.
1126121	1126701	It's sad.
1127161	1134304	Like every good arcade I've ever known is gone or replaced with something that is under the disguise of a good arcade, but it's not.
1135824	1136165	I don't know.
1137045	1137465	I'm sad.
1138393	1139013	So are you excited?
1139054	1142456	I know you're a Capcom Fighting Girl fan, DarkSakura.
1142476	1143797	Are you excited about Street Fighter 4?
1144157	1144718	Hell yeah!
1144938	1146859	What do you hope they do differently this time?
1147220	1148020	Take out Chun-Li.
1149141	1150382	No, they can't do that!
1150642	1151403	And put in Sakura.
1152163	1154105	Why would... They would never take out Chun-Li.
1154145	1154905	Why would they do that?
1155186	1157067	Because I'm sick of all of the fanboyism.
1157727	1158248	Seriously.
1158808	1164933	It's like... Okay, her moves are all... She's like... I'm trying to...
1166014	1166775	Oro He needs to leave
1193164	1195585	He needs to come back but missing another arm.
1195985	1196885	Or a leg or something.
1197065	1198365	That'd be awesome.
1198385	1199285	The joke will continue.
1199305	1200406	Because then he'd be Elena.
1201906	1202546	And fight with his legs.
1203166	1203907	She was cool too.
1204007	1204787	She needs to come back.
1205947	1213069	And they need to actually have... Do they have any characters in the game who use Taekwondo?
1213709	1216349	FootyMonster says, DarkSakura, fuck you.
1216430	1218310	Leave my beautiful thunder thighs alone.
1220424	1222185	Hey, I have kick power, thank you.
1222265	1229369	I think that they should take Street Fighter 4 and actually add other Capcom characters into it instead of just this Capcom versus shit.
1229909	1232871	Then you'd have Puzzle Fighter.
1233611	1236433	Not Puzzle Fighter, but Pocket Fighter.
1237578	1240900	I'm all fine with them putting in new characters.
1241260	1243421	Why not have some new characters to sell?
1243741	1245622	Like Soul Calibur 3 kind of did it.
1245642	1248824	They had the guy with the big old sickle and stuff.
1249464	1250785	They're able to sell out new characters.
1251045	1253947	Seriously, don't follow the route of Tekken 6.
1253987	1257469	Because Bob, the fat guy that sort of looks like Mario.
1258009	1260390	No, that's not a cool character.
1260830	1261951	You know what I would like to see?
1262831	1264112	I would like to see a tag mode.
1265760	1267221	Like the versus games.
1268681	1269641	I think that would be cool.
1269661	1276464	I also really wouldn't mind just another Capcom versus game that isn't like, what was it, Fighting Evolution.
1276604	1285187	I want them to go back to the Marvel versus Capcom style that they did because that was probably one of their most solid fighting games.
1285247	1287588	But I wanted to have like a, you know what they need to do?
1288628	1290969	Instead of doing Street Fighter 4, we need another freaking Cyberbots.
1292715	1295576	Blaze in our chatroom is getting in on the Capcom crossover madness.
1295616	1298896	He says, Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth in Street Fighter 4.
1300117	1300597	Objection.
1300637	1306978	They should just do a new game series called Capcom Versus and then do a new installment each year.
1307198	1310679	No, I think they should focus on Street Fighter 4 and making it good.
1311019	1313740	And I don't think they should do any of this crossover bullshit.
1313800	1316880	I think they should focus on making a new, original, fun game.
1316920	1319461	To talk to Son of Dad for a moment...
1320101	1326204	They, first of all, the Final Fight characters were in the Alpha series and that is, it's a different type of game.
1326244	1328105	It plays different than how 3 was.
1328145	1331366	I mean, I kind of liked how 3 was with the parrying system.
1331406	1332987	I thought that was cool and that needs to stay.
1334668	1339730	Especially because I have one time parried a Shoryuken, so that was really cool.
1339750	1340651	That was my awesome moment.
1342592	1346914	But I think that they need to have a few more unique styles.
1347214	1347914	I thought it was really good.
1347934	1349115	They had a boxer in there.
1349175	1349615	They had
1350396	1353878	You know, the stupid one-armed guy that kind of grossed me out.
1353918	1355418	They need a luchador.
1356019	1356719	They need a luchador.
1357279	1357999	No, they had one.
1358039	1359440	They had Vega.
1359980	1361421	He wasn't really a luchador, though.
1361501	1362001	No, not luchador.
1362021	1364002	I'm thinking Matador.
1364222	1365643	No, they do need a luchador.
1365663	1367103	They need Mexican wrestling.
1368424	1368944	That'd be cool.
1370405	1370765	They need...
1371445	1377926	Well, there was Armika in... In fact, Scrooge is a luchador.
1377946	1379026	They just need Santo in there.
1380387	1390388	No, they need to... Oh, God, they need a... Well, not like a wrestler-wrestler, but they need like a big brawler.
1390608	1394769	Not like Zangief was, but just like this brute character.
1395169	1395929	Like T-Hawk?
1396489	1397390	No, T-Hawk was a wrestler.
1397790	1397890	Oh.
1398650	1399250	They need this...
1401801	1405665	Just like the slow, like, oh god, who was it in Darkstalkers?
1405785	1408087	Suddenly this game's turning into Saturday Night Slammasters.
1409342	1415006	They need something like that, where they're slow and tough, but that's just the thing.
1415347	1417388	They're slow and tough, and that's what's frustrating about them.
1417408	1418509	Do another Darkstalkers game.
1418529	1419490	That'd be kind of cool.
1419650	1421311	We need a good Darkstalkers game.
1421351	1424834	Okay, I love these comments from chat rooms on the crossover games.
1424894	1426556	GS68 says, Fuck crossovers.
1426616	1427737	Stop feeding the fanboys.
1428177	1431319	Sephiroth1215 says, Street Fighter is only for Street Fighter characters.
1431660	1432941	You want other Capcom characters?
1433001	1434342	Play the Wacky Versus series.
1435714	1439388	Hey, I was hoping they'd come out with another Sega Versus series.
1440695	1443417	All I have to say is thank God they're sticking with 2D.
1443717	1448421	Because I seem to remember there was a 3D Street Fighter game, like Rosal Golfland had it, didn't they?
1448461	1451444	And it was, oh God, it was so horrible.
1451804	1456267	Son of Dad is saying exactly what I was thinking, that they need more unique styles in the game.
1456728	1469658	And also, just to talk to Hitson, I actually like Darkstalkers 3, and I've actually played it where all the character sprites on the screen were missing because my employer at the time when I worked for an arcade was fixing it while I was playing it.
1470766	1471867	and be the game that way.
1472648	1476292	But... Fighters Megamix 2.
1476453	1477133	That's a good idea.
1477774	1478315	Oh, thank you.
1478415	1479716	The chat reminded me.
1479756	1481098	I'm thinking of the EX series.
1481138	1482059	Those were the 3D ones.
1482199	1485122	Yeah, and Dark Knight reminds me that Capcom didn't do the 3D ones.
1485483	1485643	No.
1485823	1487826	Well, they should sue whoever did it.
1488526	1488847	Again.
1489628	1495152	Just because people actually remember how horrible those games are, so they should sue them again if they haven't already.
1495292	1500616	You know what game that I would like for them to make, and this is what I would totally call it too, is Capcom Fighting Universe.
1502057	1503898	Just a big clusterfuck of every character ever?
1504118	1505539	You have your Rival Schools characters.
1505719	1506160	Oh lordy.
1506300	1510603	You have your Alpha characters, you have your She-Fighter 3, you have your Cyberbots.
1510623	1512784	They did something like that though.
1512804	1514626	Fan girl alert, fan girl alert.
1514646	1517508	I think that was like Capcom Fighting Evolution or something like that.
1517528	1518268	Yeah, but that game sucked.
1518328	1518989	It wasn't the best of.
1519594	1520875	Capcom Fighting Evolution sucked.
1522137	1528063	They need to just do... Get the wolf from Akami, get the guy from Dead Rising.
1528243	1531607	You choose your mode at the beginning of the game and everyone fights in the same mode.
1532321	1534541	Alright, too much fanboy stuff for me.
1534581	1536362	We've got to move on with the other Capcom news.
1536542	1540923	Speaking of the wolf from Okami, Okami for the Wii has been confirmed.
1541223	1543623	Okami is coming to the Nintendo Wii in the spring of 2008.
1545084	1549204	If you've played Okami, it's the kind of game that really could benefit from some motion controls.
1549705	1552825	And certainly the game will be making use of the Wiimote controls.
1553125	1556746	The motion controls will be used primarily for the Celestial Brush game.
1557435	1563379	I'm actually excited about this because Okami's kind of one of those games everybody said I should play and I didn't really get to play enough of.
1563459	1568643	Like, there was just so many games coming out around that time, so this kind of allows a lot of people like me to take a second look.
1568943	1570845	Just like when Resident Evil 4 came out for the Wii.
1571365	1571846	Same thing.
1571906	1573427	I think it's a good choice for them to bring it there.
1574187	1577290	I think it's an excellent choice, so I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out.
1577350	1578070	Okami on the Wii.
1578330	1581873	You know, and this is kind of off the subject a little bit, but...
1583620	1592947	I'm surprised they haven't brought Beautiful Joe to the Wii, but then that made me think, how much do you want to bet that there might be a character announced that's Beautiful Joe for Super Smash Bros.?
1594448	1594969	Interesting.
1595329	1595669	I don't know.
1595789	1598151	Because they did have that game that was sort of like Smash Bros.
1598171	1603575	with Beautiful Joe, but... I think Beautiful Joe's on ice for a little bit, and that's just fine, because, like... It sucked.
1603795	1608419	Well, it started good, but then it was one of those, like, saturation...
1609406	1611407	Yeah, but it got too oversaturated.
1611427	1616388	So I think Capcom's doing the smart thing right now, and Beautiful Joe, at least it seems to me anyway, is on ice for a little while.
1616788	1617688	And that's just fine by me.
1618328	1619229	The series needs to be on ice.
1619489	1622250	Well, there is a little bit more good Capcom news.
1622830	1630992	They have released word about a game called Dark Void that will be out next winter, developed by Airtight Games.
1631392	1633853	They gave us Crimson Skies, High Road to Revenge.
1634573	1637134	So it is supposed to be...
1638456	1639757	Midair and On Foot.
1641158	1645922	And they haven't said what it's going to be on, although they're thinking PS3 and Xbox 360.
1646682	1651646	So it's a game where you go against these... They're called the Watchers.
1652547	1653407	And they've been watching.
1653728	1656750	And now they stopped watching and are doing... What have they been watching me do?
1656970	1657270	Porn.
1658471	1658871	Oh, noes.
1659592	1661453	Ceiling Watchers are watching you fap.
1663035	1663435	Oh, noes.
1665888	1667449	Well, hooray for original ideas, right?
1667469	1669770	Because this is a whole new IP for them, right?
1670070	1671731	Yeah, it's a new world.
1671991	1672331	Well, good.
1673391	1680034	Well, folks that may have owned a PS3 and not a 360 have missed out on the Lost Planet series.
1680054	1680695	Well, fear not.
1681015	1682996	Capcom... Unless you owned a computer.
1684076	1685056	Unless you owned a PC.
1685457	1687518	But who owns a PC nowadays?
1687578	1688378	I mean, seriously.
1688898	1689538	Nobody.
1691279	1692300	Nobody owns a computer.
1692320	1693920	Who plays games on PCs anymore?
1693960	1695221	That's just ridiculous talk.
1696084	1696324	Anyways.
1697044	1699425	No, but seriously, Lost Planet's coming to the PS3.
1699445	1706647	They're going to have all the features and download content that was available for the PC and Xbox 360 versions.
1707027	1709388	It's supposed to come out in the spring, so... Hooray!
1709508	1711609	You get your Lost Planet almost a year later.
1714870	1716250	Are they doing anything extra for it?
1716450	1717031	Extra levels?
1717131	1717811	Extra characters?
1717931	1719491	Extra... Just the download content.
1719531	1720192	That's pretty much it.
1720212	1721632	The stuff that was available later on.
1721912	1722292	I mean... So...
1726520	1727940	It's not really that extra, I guess.
1727960	1730141	It was all the bonus stuff that was available already.
1730481	1731441	No dress-up mode?
1732362	1732502	No.
1733282	1733542	Nothing.
1733962	1734402	That's too bad.
1734462	1739704	It says apparently now that it can fit all that stuff on the Blu-ray disc, so that's why it wasn't downloaded content now.
1740184	1741824	I like SonOfDad's comment in chat.
1741864	1746386	SonOfDad says in chat, chat.orangeonjuray.com, Lost Planet PlayStation 3?
1747206	1747606	No.
1748166	1749447	Dead Rising PlayStation 3?
1749487	1749547	Yes.
1752008	1752968	That would be sweet.
1753388	1764310	And honestly, if they're looking for a game that would take advantage of their little Shaker controller like an idiot function, then Dead Rising would be a good one to look at.
1764651	1766971	Here's the thing, and this is kind of good news for you guys.
1767031	1774412	If you think about it, I would think that they would pick Dead Rising over Lost Planet anyways because I think Dead Rising sold more anyways.
1776093	1776773	So that means...
1777743	1784525	To me, that means that they're making a sequel, so instead of porting the original, they're just going to make a sequel for both platforms.
1784545	1786426	Well, duh, they've got to be making a sequel.
1786466	1788666	I mean, how could they not be making a sequel to Dead Rising?
1788986	1793168	Okay, please God, fix the damn save system, because that was horrible.
1793388	1796169	I stopped playing the game because of that, sadly.
1796789	1800290	That and the fact that my monitor sucked at the time, so I couldn't see anything in the dark.
1800870	1803751	But, um, fix the save system.
1804656	1808178	Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix
1828490	1831031	The HD remix, of course, supports widescreen.
1831331	1832491	We kind of figured that would happen.
1832771	1837753	The music has all been completely remixed for the game, which doesn't actually surprise me too much.
1837793	1838873	I think we needed that, too.
1840273	1849216	There will also be, however, not just the HD version, but an arcade mirror of the Super Street Fighter II Turbo arcade version.
1849256	1852837	So if you want your purist version, that will be included in the game.
1853697	1857660	Also, apparently, some balancing has gone into effect, some rebalancing.
1857700	1865986	I'm not sure if that means some attacks do more damages, or some characters' movements are different, or what have you, but there has been some rebalancing done.
1866367	1869469	Not the first time Capcom's gone back and rebalanced one of their games.
1869549	1873832	Just take a look at Puzzle Fighter 2, had some rebalancing going on with the drops.
1874112	1878816	But if you wanted to, you could also play in your arcade-perfect-nothing-has-been-changed mode.
1879409	1879589	Well, um,
1907760	1918923	One other thing that I think is very, very, very cool, and I'm very, very, very excited about this, is that Bionic Commando is getting a remake.
1919644	1921224	Fuck yeah, it's about fucking time.
1921244	1922004	Fuck yes.
1922504	1924465	I wonder if you still get to kill Hitler in it.
1925558	1928521	No, but it still looks awesome if you've seen the video for it.
1928861	1932485	I've only seen the little preview that showed the screenshots.
1932525	1933646	I've not seen the game in motion.
1933666	1935007	No, the video is all here.
1935087	1938190	Because I was a little nervous about the 3D looking.
1938811	1945998	I mean... Well, at any rate, it's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
1946338	1948720	You know, I'm noticing that we're getting a lot more...
1949802	1953906	What would have been usually a console or only game on the PC now?
1954346	1956588	There's a lot more love for PC gamers.
1956668	1957148	I don't know why.
1957229	1958690	No one plays games on the PC anymore.
1959070	1960051	Seriously.
1960111	1960772	Nobody.
1961012	1963194	You know you just got yelled at by several people in chat.
1963214	1964435	I beat sarcastic people.
1964535	1964935	Shit.
1964995	1965576	Come on.
1966416	1967437	Are you that dumb?
1967497	1969359	Of course people play games on a PC.
1969459	1970720	How many million people play WoW?
1970740	1981269	It used to be that we'd mainly get our first person shooters on PC, but now we're seeing more and more of them on consoles, and we're seeing more and more platformers come out for PC.
1982090	1986694	So it's like the whole gaming community is now sort of banding together.
1986774	1990017	Well, remember folks, the PlayStation 3 is a computer, remember?
1990317	1991038	No, it's not.
1992458	1996001	No, but according to the marketing, that's a little more accurate.
1996302	1996742	Yes, it is.
1996802	1997263	No, it's not.
1997303	1997723	Yes, it is.
1997783	1998224	No, it's not.
1998324	2002107	Well, at any rate, Capcom is working with Grin.
2004670	2006692	They did a Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter PC.
2007853	2014940	And it also, they have not announced a Wii release.
2015641	2016621	And Tigerclaw on our chat.
2016642	2017102	Or a release date.
2017591	2021852	Yeah, Tigerclaw in our chatroom has something to say about the lack of a Wii Bionic Commando.
2022272	2023672	Surprisingly, no Wii version.
2024013	2028814	The game looks like something perfect for the Wiimote, and it's surprising that they're not making it for it.
2029134	2033715	Nintendo could have cashed in on it by re-releasing the original NES version on the Virtual Console.
2034095	2038776	Well, they'll probably still try to cash in on it anyways, but here's the problem, though, with the Wii.
2039296	2040737	It can't handle the game.
2041098	2045321	Just because it has the little waggle controls and stuff that would be perfect for this.
2045581	2047663	Unfortunately, Nintendo decided, hey, you know what?
2048043	2050726	We don't really care about graphics, so sorry.
2051286	2051927	Can't make that.
2052247	2055469	However, if they had ported it to the PlayStation 2, yeah, we could port that pretty easy.
2055509	2056330	Well, but wait a minute, though.
2056450	2062275	Ultimately, that was Capcom's decision to say, we're going to go for, you know, the highest quality.
2062657	2069638	quality in looks and, you know, sound department as opposed to incorporating the wiggle waggles.
2069778	2080361	You have to understand that people on the PlayStation 3 and 360 love action games, you know, much like, you know, Dead Rising, Lost Planet, you know, the new Bionic Commando game and stuff like that.
2081601	2086762	We gamers only like Zack and Wiki, Quest for Rose Treasure.
2087202	2088602	That's the only thing that they can have.
2088622	2090543	Oh yeah, that's my favorite fucking game right there.
2091283	2092023	That and Resident Evil 4.
2092637	2094018	It's a little mix up there, but yeah.
2095478	2102041	I think that Capcom could do something if they were willing to, you know, focus on gameplay more.
2103621	2108263	Then again, one of the things I've always enjoyed about many Capcom games is that they do tend to have really good gameplay.
2109344	2110844	Fuck that, make me some more Mega Man Legends.
2110904	2111565	I can go on the Wii.
2111725	2112005	Perfect.
2112025	2112405	Done.
2112465	2112645	Done.
2113555	2114815	That's a series that needs to die.
2115235	2118236	NM64 wants to remind you also on the Wii, minigames.
2118756	2119256	My mistake.
2119276	2119876	Lots of minigames.
2120256	2121437	Bionic Commando minigames.
2121497	2122617	Oh, look, pop the bubbles.
2123657	2124957	Kill Hitler again and again.
2127618	2128678	Wii.
2129238	2129658	Who knows?
2131099	2134499	Dafo in the chat room would like to say, Zack and Wiki looks awesome.
2134539	2135620	How dare that be bashed?
2136220	2138800	How dare you, Loki, on this program?
2139100	2142001	On this show, there's not much that we don't dare to do.
2143143	2143883	at different times.
2144044	2149427	Son of Dad would like to remind us all that Okami's being ported to the Wii and not to next-gen with sharp graphics.
2149827	2155170	So the Wii is getting kind of something that... I think it's been proven that the Wii can handle cell shading fairly well.
2155230	2156811	Isn't Okami cell shaded?
2156891	2160313	I'm just awfully surprised that Wii's getting yet another PlayStation 2 port.
2160353	2161774	Hmm, that's surprising.
2162214	2167997	You know, with Resident Evil 4 and all those other fucking games that PlayStation 2, Xbox 360 port, or Xbox ports...
2170069	2175194	Ryoma says, if you're going to do the Bionic Commando minigames, pick Hitler's nose.
2176675	2178997	Like that one game in WarioWare.
2179878	2182460	This just in on the Smash Dojo.
2182540	2183741	Hitler, the new character.
2185683	2186844	I don't know about that one.
2189086	2191048	I don't think so.
2191994	2200137	and M64 reminds you very subtly, but not really, that RE4 was a GameCube port, not a PS2 port.
2201778	2206960	I believe it was a PlayStation 2 port for this one because it had the upgraded graphics from the PlayStation 2 and the additional features.
2207600	2208860	But yeah, it was on the GameCube too.
2209000	2215023	So they could have hybrid, you know, some bastard child of the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions.
2215043	2217343	So what you're basically trying to say is I'm right and you're wrong.
2218424	2221185	Yes, that's exact... Thank you for...
2221815	2222776	Nailing home my point there.
2223196	2224577	You're welcome, that's what I do here.
2225058	2232024	Alright, since these games won't be out until next year at the earliest, let's talk about some stuff you can get right now, this week.
2232584	2236027	Definitely, and there's going to be lots of fun stuff coming out this week.
2237188	2247217	Some stuff, I don't know, people, why you want them or not, but of the many things, the ever-controversial...
2248175	2251020	Eye of Judgment is coming out this week on PlayStation 3.
2251380	2256469	Yes, you'll be able to play your Magic the Gathering type of crap with the eye.
2257145	2258206	The PlayStation Eye.
2258426	2267191	And remember, folks, if one million copies of this game sell, Loki will dress up in a Tingle outfit and set an eye of judgment on fire for your viewing pleasure.
2267231	2268252	He should dance around it.
2268712	2271234	I think you should do this anyway, because it would be so funny.
2271254	2272214	I'm not going to do that.
2272495	2273015	You can burn it.
2273035	2274416	Stop trying to cop out.
2274776	2280980	Okay, if it doesn't sell a million, though, while we will not require you to dress as Tingle, you need to at least wear the hat and burn it.
2282000	2282481	What hat?
2283201	2290205	Can we negotiate that maybe if they can sell 50,000 units, you'll just wear the little green hat and set it on fire?
2290225	2291386	No, I'm not doing that.
2292667	2293387	It's all or nothing.
2294568	2294948	Damn it.
2295689	2297050	Will you at least set one on fire?
2298130	2300672	Maybe, if someone sends me one for free, I'll set one on fire.
2300692	2301652	We should dance around it.
2302773	2304374	I'm not going to buy one to set one on fire.
2304414	2305355	That's stupid.
2305455	2307716	If we all put in 20 bucks, we could buy one to set on fire.
2307776	2308056	Come on.
2308436	2308797	Anyways.
2309497	2310598	BurnMyEyeOfJudgment.com
2312725	2316186	Ace Combat 6 is coming out on Xbox 360.
2316567	2319808	So that's pretty interesting.
2320248	2321029	I don't know, it's a good game.
2321909	2324830	Clive Barker's Jericho is coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2325130	2327311	It's a horror first-person shooter game.
2328352	2332873	Conan, also coming out in both systems as well, and as I reviewed it, it's pretty good.
2333154	2334794	So definitely worth checking it out.
2336775	2338696	Let's see, King of Fighters 11 on PlayStation 2.
2340189	2342690	And that's a really budget game, too.
2342710	2343870	$14.99, if I remember correctly.
2344311	2347812	Dancing with the Stars on the Wii and PlayStation 2.
2348152	2348732	And you know what?
2348752	2349112	Yippee.
2349132	2350253	That sounds fun.
2350313	2351673	Actually, it's only on the Wii this week.
2351713	2352814	PlayStation 2 is coming out later.
2353444	2354345	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2376585	2378126	I'm not buying it, but, you know, hey.
2378606	2381507	Well, I think it would be a good idea if they used the X-Tango engine.
2381567	2382868	It might be cool to rent it.
2383248	2384648	I don't know if it's the X-Tango engine.
2384708	2386329	Hold on, am I in Bizarro World?
2386369	2389170	Are you guys actually hyping the Dancing with the Stars video game?
2389250	2389850	I would play it.
2389890	2391371	It's like 20 bucks, okay?
2391991	2393152	I like Dancing with the Stars.
2393432	2394492	I like X-Tango.
2394532	2395332	I guess I'll give you that.
2395693	2398534	Hey, hey, I'm not seeing this game as X-Tango, okay?
2398974	2399274	Because...
2399881	2402543	We're not going to dirty the Xtango name with this game.
2402643	2403143	Sorry, my bad.
2403223	2404444	Apologies to the folks behind Xtango.
2404684	2407025	Actually, I do like Dancing with the Stars, Rob.
2407945	2408206	Really?
2408246	2409446	But you don't watch TV, I thought.
2409866	2411727	I watch the dances on YouTube.
2412508	2412568	Oh.
2412608	2415710	Because it was all about the Stacey Keebler series.
2416550	2417771	Oh, okay.
2417811	2420092	PlayStation 3 is getting quite a few games here.
2420132	2421353	Juice 2, Hot Import Nights.
2421373	2422413	Yeah, you're finally getting that now.
2422893	2424794	Ratchet & Clank Future, Tools of Destruction.
2425155	2426075	That should be pretty awesome.
2426575	2429217	Ratatouille, that's coming out.
2429944	2431925	and let's see here.
2432785	2437067	On the Wii, actually in PlayStation 2 as well, Nicktoons Attack of the Toybots.
2438288	2443610	This week also, the game I was just making fun of, Zack and Wiki, The Quest for Barbara's Treasure is also coming out.
2444130	2444790	How dare you.
2445330	2450392	Namco Museum Remix, hooray, that's also coming out on the Wii.
2450613	2451473	And then let's see here.
2453709	2480608	PSP, Castlevania, Dracula X Chronicles Warriors of the Lost Empires Spongebob, Atlantis, SquarePantis DS, Phoenix Wright, Trials and Tribulations Mega Man ZX, Advent Spanish for Everyone
2481616	2484459	Naruto Path of the Ninja Wait, is that the name of a game?
2484519	2485520	Spanish for Everyone?
2485820	2486621	Spanish for Everyone.
2487742	2490105	What do you do in Spanish for Everyone?
2490565	2491586	You learn Spanish.
2492527	2493789	Oh.
2494610	2495390	Let's see here.
2495510	2499595	Chess Master, The Art of Learning, that's what it's called.
2499915	2501256	Imagine Master Chef.
2502598	2502698	Um...
2504518	2506620	I think the rest of the Imagine games are coming out this week.
2506780	2507260	Oh, that's right.
2507620	2509942	Imagine Animal Doctor is also coming out.
2510022	2510883	Imagine Babies.
2511304	2513786	Imagine Fashion Designer and Imagine MasterChef.
2513826	2515187	Finally, Imagine Babies.
2515207	2515847	You know what I want?
2515948	2517109	I want Imagine Sniper.
2518470	2518710	Sorry.
2519651	2523834	Unfortunately, you know, snipers, not that popular with little girls.
2524175	2525476	I wanted to be a sniper when I was growing up.
2525496	2527798	But when it does become popular, they will have Imagine Snipers.
2528198	2529579	But unfortunately, they don't right now.
2529619	2531521	GS68 says Imagine John Lennon.
2532197	2541642	Imagine, or, I'm sorry, Pocket Pets, which is yet another pet-raising sim, and apparently, judging by the cover, it features bunnies, kittens, and little birdies.
2542463	2543123	Yay!
2544984	2546325	Where's the hippopotamuses?
2546765	2547405	Or hippopotami?
2547425	2549146	Tiger Claw says Imagine OLR, by the way.
2551261	2556604	And then I was going to say also Naruto Clash of the Ninja Revolution on Wii.
2557544	2561306	And then finally just a small little game, of course, on almost everything.
2561366	2565427	PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, Wii, and maybe the PC this week.
2566248	2570170	And actually a week from now, Guitar Hero 3 will be making its way out.
2572130	2572531	Excellent.
2572671	2573271	On a Sunday.
2573291	2574652	Wait, is that out this Tuesday?
2574872	2575932	It's out on next Sunday.
2575952	2576753	Oh, it's on Sunday.
2577053	2577333	On the 28th.
2578547	2581449	because they have to be so cool Sunday.
2582689	2586091	This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Guitar Hero 3 for everybody.
2586432	2587012	Let's see here.
2587072	2589914	I was going to say, I'm looking real quick on the PC stuff.
2591635	2594917	Oh, there are some interesting PC games I was going to mention real quick.
2596378	2602201	Dream Day Honeymoon, which I have no idea what that is, but I want to take a look here real quick.
2602581	2603922	You want to go on a Dream Day Honeymoon?
2604335	2605156	Dream Day Honeymoon.
2605276	2608638	Actually, there's no information for that whatsoever, but that is available if you're curious.
2610039	2612942	And some Agatha Christie game.
2614343	2614643	That's it.
2615544	2615844	All right.
2616244	2620527	Let's travel over to Japan and see what our friends overseas in Japan are picking up this week.
2621488	2624831	You can get on the Xbox 360, Bladestorm.
2624911	2627573	The Hundred Years War is coming out on the Xbox 360.
2627973	2631776	That's from Koei, who I believe brought you Dynasty Wars.
2631816	2631896	Yes.
2633348	2634910	Oh, I forgot to mention, U.S.
2635510	2637072	Tomb Raider Anniversary on the 360th.
2637772	2638433	It's my turn now.
2639114	2639494	My turn.
2639634	2641876	I'm done.
2641936	2643678	Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party!
2644319	2652687	Yubamani fans over in Japan get a chance now with the Wii version of DDR, the latest title, finally hitting Japanese shelves this week.
2653127	2653368	That's...
2654498	2656899	Usually, I remember back in the day, it used to be the other way around.
2656939	2661801	Japan would get these games like years before we would get them, and now it seems like we get a few of these first.
2662141	2663582	So I think the same thing happened with Supernova 2.
2663922	2664382	I don't remember.
2665422	2670665	Also on the Nintendo Wii, Ghost Squad is coming out from Sega in Japan.
2671165	2674586	Also coming out on the Wii, the simple Wii series.
2674666	2682189	There's Volume 1, the Mina de Kart Race, and there's Volume 2, the Mina de Basuri Takai is coming out.
2682689	2684030	So I'm assuming that's like
2684887	2686728	It's like a Mario Kart game.
2709133	2710434	The Eye of Judgment God of War 2 The End Begins
2737783	2743370	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Itsuka Todoku Ano Sora Ni is coming out.
2743430	2750238	That's an adventure game that looks to be based on yet another anime starring cute little girls in schoolgirl outfits.
2751199	2755824	Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, Baldur Bullet Equilibrium coming from Alchemist.
2756284	2758447	It looks like another mech warrior type game.
2759793	2760894	Dungeon Maker Final Fantasy Tactics A2
2783240	2784101	Frogman Show Action Minigames
2813089	2814069	Action-based minigames.
2814890	2816050	That's it for Japanese releases.
2838112	2864686	Coded Arms Contagion, Escape from Paradise City on PSP, Escape from Paradise City on PC, Jackass the Game on PSP, Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, King of Clubs, Metroid Prime 3, Corruption on Wii, NBA 2K8, NBA Live 08, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Portal on PlayStation 3, Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on a bunch of stuff, Stranglehold, Syphon Filter, Dark Mirror,
2866085	2877014	Team Fortress 2, The Sims 2, Castaway, The Witcher on PC, Virtua Fighter 5, Who the Hell Cares, Wipeout Pulse on PSP, and Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on PSP.
2878755	2879596	Alright, awesome.
2880717	2893627	Well, in un-gaming release news, apparently this week they've been having some interesting guests on the morning show here in the US, and
2894517	2894857	Susan Bartel
2921053	2928357	Supergirl in the show says, when kids play violent video games, we can see that their brains are different than when they play non-violent games.
2929017	2935341	Going on to say, we can see a very big difference in their brains, which tells us how dangerous these games can be.
2937882	2946627	And, you know... Just an FYI, according to Wikipedia, the morning show with Mike and Juliet is mostly on Fox and My Network TV stations.
2946687	2947267	It's syndicated.
2948688	2949288	Yay!
2950229	2950309	Um...
2951221	2964291	So basically, they're saying that, I guess she wrapped the whole segment up by saying they're going to react in the same highly aroused, angry way that we saw what happened yesterday.
2964331	2970156	Of course, they were talking about a school shooting that happened in Cleveland that she was referencing back to that.
2970456	2978342	Well, here's the interesting thing about that, though, you see, because Game Politics actually went and asked her about that.
2978763	2980444	because they had some issues with it.
2980584	2992154	One of the things that they found, I guess, concerning, I guess, was a comment when they saw the Indiana University brain scan pic five minutes before the airing of the show.
2992654	3004704	So she had looked at, basically, the brain scan image literally minutes before the show started, and they were saying, well, how can you base your professional opinion on just a brief glance at it?
3005364	3007246	And she was saying, well, it's, you know...
3008836	3014259	Not concrete proof, but that doesn't change anything.
3015580	3020462	She's saying that maybe it's a little bit sensationalized because it's on TV and stuff.
3020682	3022083	She's like, I understand how you feel.
3022123	3024644	There's an element of sensationalism to it, I suppose.
3025224	3029567	I couldn't, five minutes before going on air, say, sorry, I won't do it.
3030507	3033329	I don't have enough background information about this brain scan.
3033389	3035610	I'm not that much of a purist.
3035650	3037931	Basically, she's talking out of her ass.
3039039	3039379	Awesome.
3039920	3064220	And then to follow up with the whole thing, Game Politics also ran another story about, I guess it was being reported in Scientific America, Richard Tremblay, a professor of pediatrics, psychiatry, and psychology, said that kids were aggressive before modern media came along, so we can't blame modern media for kids being aggressive.
3064240	3066983	Well, then again, wasn't there the study on how...
3068152	3069353	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3097560	3100924	Blaze says, couldn't various games cause the same brain scan read?
3101945	3105150	DarkShy wants to know, why are all school shootings blamed on video games?
3106161	3118386	and GS68 is wondering, since we call Tack Johnson, because we don't want to call him by name and he's effectively banned from the show, since we call him Lord Voldemort, just in case you're first time listening and you wonder, who the hell is Voldemort?
3118766	3122267	It's that guy, that lawyer guy that needs to STFU.
3123168	3127329	GS68 is wondering, should we call this lady Bellatrix Lestrange?
3129250	3131451	She had an unhealthy obsession with...
3132190	3139393	To be honest, I don't think she's going to be randomly posting on different websites about shit, making threats, and acting purely crazy.
3141134	3146136	So, I don't think we really need to worry about calling her anything else, since obviously she's going to be out of the news.
3147456	3148517	We should call her Loser.
3148937	3153819	You know what, I agree with what Shadow Charlie said, and honestly, I think this just pretty much sums up our feedback.
3153859	3156640	Shadow Charlie in our chatroom says, she can shut the fuck up.
3158303	3159124	She really can.
3159645	3165431	And, you know, people like this just get our anger going and our blood boiling.
3166372	3176083	You knew when you read this story on Game Politics or wherever you might have seen it earlier this week, you knew that on this program, this segment would be following a story about this stupid, stupid woman.
3176544	3177465	It's the FUs of the Week.
3193636	3199438	My FU of the week goes towards certain things at my place of employment.
3201198	3214843	Without getting into too much detail about what I do for a living, I work a job that they assign tasks to me that I'm supposed to have done within a certain number of days, right?
3215723	3218384	And on average, I do about 70 to 80 a day.
3219144	3221885	So I come in one day and there's 600 and something of them.
3222924	3225626	And so, I closed 110 that day.
3226947	3228368	Which is a lot more than I usually do.
3229108	3231550	I came back the next day, there were 704.
3232711	3233831	I closed 90 that day.
3234011	3235653	I came back in, there were 780.
3238154	3239335	So, yeah.
3239995	3249902	Um, I have a right to complain about this because, um, if I don't finish enough of it within my turnaround time, then it comes back and I get dinged for it.
3250503	3251083	So, um,
3251937	3260001	Don't be surprised when certain things happen, is all I'm going to say.
3260541	3264684	Oh, yeah, and every time I try to apply for another position at work, I'm written up for something.
3265584	3266004	Hmm.
3267965	3269326	All right, Loki, let loose.
3269466	3270066	F yous of the week.
3270547	3280912	Fuck you to Kanye West for ruining Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger by the Daft Punk and trying to claim, I guess, make his own song by sampling that entire thing.
3282375	3284316	He's awful as an artist to begin with.
3284616	3286318	And I also watched Saturday Night Live.
3286458	3289920	They had another song that he did where he sampled Pretty Young Thing from Michael Jackson.
3290240	3293222	Once again, an unoriginal bastard who needs to fucking die.
3293542	3295043	I mean, he has no talent.
3295423	3297445	And I hate people that fucking sample shit.
3299006	3300487	Also looking at you, Black Eyed Peas.
3300567	3301547	You fucking suck too.
3301647	3303108	So, F you to both of them.
3305890	3309072	My F you of the week goes to Children That Go To Disneyland.
3309650	3310491	Let's get back into some news.
3340472	3343074	Game Boy and Game Boy Pocket Rarity and Scarcity of Repair Parts
3365274	3368015	Now, when I first read this, I was actually surprised.
3368315	3370755	They've still been repairing Famicoms this long?
3371635	3371875	Yeah.
3372055	3375156	But apparently they were, and unfortunately now it is over.
3375536	3379077	Again, this is just Nintendo of Japan, but still, you know.
3379337	3382317	Dude, seriously, if you have a broken Nintendo, don't go out and buy something else.
3382457	3385518	I mean, seriously, why are you still playing Nintendo?
3385538	3386938	Bad news for retro collectors, though.
3386978	3387198	Yeah.
3387678	3391299	I wonder, though, if, well, you know, that means that the prices of these systems are going to go up.
3392025	3402768	because to use pinball as a comparison, for machines that start seeing revivals when you can start getting parts for them again, the price of the tables goes down.
3403268	3409990	But when they stop making the replacement plastics and stuff for some of the other tables, the value jumps up by at least $5,000.
3410230	3418912	To be honest, a lot of people that are collecting these retro systems anyways probably know how to fix them, or if they don't know how to fix them, know of somebody who can fix them.
3419352	3420713	I mean, there are other websites other than...
3421953	3424775	or there are other people out there that know how to fix these systems.
3424855	3426136	It's not just Nintendo.
3426496	3427177	Here's a thought.
3427297	3429538	I bet this is why they're ending the support now.
3430139	3440686	Why would they want to encourage people to buy the games at garage sales and stuff on these old systems when they have this brand spanking new virtual console that's delivering all the games from these old consoles?
3440766	3442267	This is why they're ending support now.
3443387	3444928	I'll bet you.
3445529	3447410	I think it's just because of what they actually said.
3447670	3448771	No, I think I'm right and you're wrong.
3449301	3450562	Well, I mean, Game Boy Color.
3450582	3454504	We don't see any Game Boy Color stuff on fucking... Yet.
3455265	3456125	Oh, come on.
3456145	3457586	It would look like shit.
3458167	3459408	This is my theory behind it.
3460849	3469774	Why waste manpower on something the company itself has decided was obsolete when they can focus towards their current thing?
3470815	3473837	It's sort of like paying somebody to fix a Betamax.
3475058	3475318	You know?
3476556	3477637	I kind of buy that.
3477697	3478657	That makes sense to me.
3478697	3481880	But at the same time, why didn't they do that 10 years ago with the Famicom?
3482881	3484603	I mean, Famicom has been out like 20 years.
3485143	3490609	But 10 years ago, I think that they still had a big enough user base because 10 years ago, what was it that we were seeing out?
3490649	3492050	I was still playing my Super Nintendo.
3492350	3494112	I think the N64 had just been out.
3495199	3497321	Because the Famicom is still probably outselling the PlayStation 3.
3497441	3505008	And on top of that, the only way you could get any of your retro games is to either own the old system or to play on emulators.
3505548	3513555	But now we have it to where all these games are being re-released on, you know, we have Virtual Console, we have Xbox Live Arcade.
3514136	3517038	And so they're looking at it as progress.
3517559	3522223	What's the point now when they can get the same thing on one of our more up-to-date systems?
3523146	3525868	So why should they waste the support, manpower, and product?
3525968	3533014	Well, if they make some systems actually put on the market, you know, so we can buy them to replace our broken Famicom.
3533034	3533875	Well, maybe that's why.
3533895	3534435	Well, okay.
3534495	3536357	Now, maybe that's why they've got to pull the old support.
3536397	3537718	Get some people on the assembly line.
3537918	3548146	And to go back to my, I guess, analogy to the Betamax, you know, you can't get Sony to replace your Betamax machine, but you can go to specialty repair shops and they'll do it.
3548446	3549867	It's going to be the same way with old systems.
3551549	3551829	All right.
3552537	3553398	Virtual Console Stuff for the UK!
3573687	3579628	So what we are seeing out this time is World Heroes, which was a Neo Geo game.
3580188	3584769	Not really one of my favorite fighters, but it was pretty, pretty good, and it's 900 points.
3585750	3590531	And then coming up is Gate of Thunder from the TurboGrafx-16.
3591431	3602053	It was made by Hudson, and that was a pretty damn good game, where you have your ship called the Hunting Dog, and you are saving the starlight power.
3603228	3607212	I think that's cool because the planet referred to as Planet Ares and I'm an Ares, so that's cool.
3607592	3608213	It's 800 points.
3608914	3617302	And, and then, and for anyone who watches the Angry Nintendo Nerd, you'll know where my frustration with this game comes from for exactly the same reason he did.
3617743	3622047	Castlevania II, Simon's Quest for the NES, where, you know...
3622984	3624305	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3644179	3646181	I don't know, I haven't played a virtual console in a while.
3646221	3648603	That's a freaking awesome game, though.
3648623	3650384	Despite the frustration, I love the game.
3650424	3652786	And honestly, the music is half of what makes that game.
3654347	3655848	I'm hoping it's over here on Monday.
3656729	3659071	I would like to see us get the Japanese version of Castlevania III.
3661013	3662714	What was the difference between that and this one?
3662754	3665816	It was certain gameplay factions that they took out.
3665876	3668779	Like, for example, if you use the... Oh, God, I can't remember his name now.
3668799	3669679	The guy who used the dagger?
3670280	3670600	Grant?
3670780	3671421	Grant, yes.
3671441	3671541	Yes.
3672172	3673873	In the Japanese version, he would throw the dagger.
3674914	3676574	And so it gave you ranged attack with him.
3678355	3680276	That's just one of the things I remember.
3680316	3682337	I always liked to use Alucard because he could turn into the bat.
3684538	3686259	I like Grant because he can climb on walls.
3686679	3687100	This is true.
3687120	3688880	And then there was the guy that had the orbs, right?
3689061	3689621	I don't even remember.
3689821	3690881	That was Saifa.
3691402	3691682	Wow.
3692202	3692802	That's old school.
3693022	3693223	Yeah.
3693983	3694363	All right.
3694963	3695564	By the way, that's 500 points.
3696910	3702354	Tiger Claw would like to point out DarkSakura, also the fact that it had two different endings, and in one of them, Simon Belmont dies.
3702534	3703795	Yes, that was the other thing.
3704856	3707357	I've played the disc version of it.
3708198	3714542	Luckily, I've played a disc version of it, and the music was also a little bit different, but then again, the disc games had a different music processor.
3714562	3717524	I was going to say, didn't they have an extra sound channel in Japan for that stuff?
3718065	3718245	Yeah.
3718786	3723889	I think I remember one of my old roommates who was really into collecting games had the old, old Castlevania III.
3724090	3724610	That's how I played it.
3724630	3725410	And that was part of the reason.
3725430	3726831	That was the first time I played it, though.
3727672	3730994	I played a disc one later on than that, but he brought it over to my house.
3731975	3732115	Ah.
3732615	3733176	I never played it.
3733576	3734216	Yeah.
3734897	3735157	All right.
3735917	3745404	Well, soon enough, GameTap will be hitting 1,000 games, and they're supposed to hit this wonderful landmark achievement on November 15th.
3747089	3751652	Ice Station Santa Abe Lincoln Must Die Missed Uru Online's final episode in the Season 1 story arc will begin the 1st of November
3776279	3777220	and let's see here.
3778240	3788066	I guess now the first three Hitman games will be free to play for the non-subscribers as that part of kind of a free game sampling that they have there that's ad-supported.
3788987	3794270	And I guess a new season of Revisioned, which before was looking at Lord Croft.
3794290	3797972	They haven't said which character they're going to do this time or which series.
3798532	3801254	And then game trailers for various games.
3803295	3803635	All right.
3804471	3804991	Sounds like fun.
3805632	3811276	I keep neglecting to go back to GameTap and checking out some of those other new games that they have, like BlastMiner.
3811617	3818222	Now they're starting to put out the indie games, too, and I'm pretty sure BlastMiner finally made its way to GameTap, so I've got to check out some of the indie stuff they have on there.
3819511	3824653	I still wish though, they have Civilization 3 up in their archives, but they don't have Civ 1.
3824973	3836457	And I, for whatever reason, and I know I've gone into this tirade on the show before, so I'll keep it short tonight, but I prefer Civilization 1, the old school one, compared to any other Civ they've released since then.
3836997	3842059	So, Sid Meier, if you happen to be listening, please let them have Civilization on GameTap.
3842479	3844720	Also, I would love you if you'd let them have Covert Action.
3845336	3849304	because that was like my favorite Sid Meier game ever and probably nobody's ever heard of it.
3850507	3852852	Anyhow, speaking of...
3854045	3854865	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3876815	3877676	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3907346	3909367	Looking forward to getting more information on the game.
3909767	3916750	All we know so far is that there is a main character named the Little King, and he creates towns to basically build up a new country.
3917110	3923112	He uses special powers to make elemental skills, and basically this is all used to develop the land.
3923152	3925373	So it almost sounds like it's some type of sim game.
3925894	3928895	It's like one half of Actraiser.
3928935	3930615	Hey, no problem with that.
3930675	3931876	I freaking love Actraiser.
3932116	3932416	You know what?
3932436	3934377	I think if I had a kid, I'd name him Little King.
3936300	3939429	Son of Dad says Wii needs a hard drive bad.
3940456	3946500	Yeah, I'm also curious how the Wii is going to fit all this stuff in here, but I wouldn't be surprised.
3946520	3948241	Nintendo's going to come out sometime next year.
3948261	3949842	That's what the SD cards are for.
3950722	3958207	They're going to come out at some point, and they're going to say, we have this super hidden expansion port thing, and we're bringing out this thing.
3958587	3963770	If you invert your Wii, you'll find the port hidden somewhere on the system motherboard.
3963950	3966732	Well, there are expansion ports that aren't being used on there right now, right?
3966752	3967112	Or USB, right?
3967132	3967232	Right.
3968574	3969717	It's got USB connections.
3969797	3970760	It does have USB.
3970820	3974812	Hell, if you even wanted to get like crazy with it, you could have something that plugs into like
3975401	3978282	I'm kind of irritated because they have all these hard drives that run on USB now, right?
3978342	3980222	I mean, like, I think I saw one at Target the other day.
3980242	3982963	Yeah, yeah, Jamie has one, but I've seen, now they even have new ones that are 500 gigabytes.
3982983	3983443	500 gigabyte USB drive.
3983463	3983843	Mine's 500 gigabytes.
3984003	3984324	Is it really?
3984344	3985264	I thought you said like a 300 something.
3985284	3985864	I paid $120 for it.
4003909	4004609	Oh my gosh.
4004629	4006210	500 gigabytes for one of those things.
4006870	4009750	And I can't... It's USB, but I can't hook it up to my Wii.
4010470	4011331	Or I can't hook it up to my 360.
4012051	4018472	And I can't... I mean, because of... Because you know they're going to want you to use anything with their name on it so they can market it and make money on it.
4018492	4019892	And I'm just saying that sucks.
4020412	4025013	Because seriously, what else am I going to fill up the 500 gigabytes with besides lots of pornography?
4025033	4025734	They're going to find a way.
4025754	4026934	Lots and lots of pornography.
4026954	4027814	They're going to find a way.
4027834	4029034	I don't know.
4029094	4032835	My USB hard drive fits quite a few Xbox 360 games quite easily.
4034205	4034786	In theory.
4034946	4036026	Next story, please.
4036787	4051277	Well, MadCatz has decided that they are going to give their support to the National Breast Cancer Foundation and release a pink tech pack for the DS Lite.
4052898	4062785	It will have accessories that have a carry case, a power adapter for your car, USB charge cable, two game cases, and two...
4064488	4065769	to the stylus pens.
4066370	4067130	So that's pretty cool.
4068591	4077458	And there's going to be a percentage from the purchase of this that's going to go toward, like I said, the National Breast Cancer Foundation and retail for $19.99.
4079807	4081848	Well, good for gaming and fundraising colliding.
4081888	4082849	That's a good thing.
4083469	4091294	Going back to the previous story in our chat room, chat.org.com, Ranma's pointing out you can get a 1 terabyte, that's 1,000 gigabytes, drive for $399.
4091574	4096057	And Sephiroth1215 says, yeah, I know someone who has a 1 terabyte drive.
4096397	4098498	What do you put on that?
4098538	4100419	I mean, that's a lot of porn.
4100859	4101700	That's a lot.
4101740	4103501	That's like weeks worth of porn.
4103641	4105622	That's what I was looking to buy was a terabyte.
4105662	4106583	They sell them at Fry's.
4107609	4108870	HD porn even.
4108890	4112573	Do you know how much HD porn you could fit on a terabyte drive?
4114294	4114995	That's a lot.
4115035	4116816	The terabyte drives are something like $300 to $400.
4118177	4119238	But iOmega makes one.
4119479	4121720	But that's 300 to 400 hours of porn.
4121900	4122541	That's amazing.
4122561	4126304	The problem is, though, downloading that amount of porn would take lots of time.
4127084	4132569	Well, the whole reason I bought mine was because, and now that it's happened, I saw it coming.
4133349	4136672	My PC was dying, so I bought my hard drive to save all my crap.
4138197	4141519	Zappy24 in chat says, a terabyte isn't as much as it seems.
4141599	4142399	It fills fast.
4142799	4144760	So you know who's been downloading the HD porn.
4145281	4146301	Just teasing.
4146321	4146881	Just teasing.
4147722	4158027	Actually, what was taking up most of mine was I have entire seasons of Doctor Who and Stargate because, you know, I don't watch TV.
4158327	4162529	Which is borderline porn for you because every time you see... I have a fangasm.
4162549	4165671	Yeah, every time you see David Tennant, like, you get a
4166167	4167748	Femboner or whatever they're called.
4169009	4170029	Sure, a fangasm.
4171570	4172170	Or a girlboner.
4172811	4173371	A girlboner.
4174392	4183677	So one thing that really shouldn't collide, but for some reason this year has been colliding more than I would like, would be baby-raising sims for the DS.
4184157	4195403	And yet another one has come along, Crave Entertainment's Baby Pals, which should be coming out in November if I remember correctly, is a baby-washing, dressing, and patty-caking sim.
4196308	4198509	It's basically Nintendogs with babies.
4200250	4205093	You have to adopt a pet human, then feed it, bathe it, dress it in funny clothes.
4205573	4211136	You can even teach it to walk, talk, though if you do... Was that the first thing?
4213117	4214838	This is also from another article here.
4215238	4219900	Their comment was, if you get them to do these things, they're probably saying, why the hell am I wearing these funny clothes?
4220841	4220921	Um...
4222069	4229956	One thing, though, they're asking in this article, which is kind of funny, is, so if you ignore your, you know, Nintendogs, you know, they run away and stuff.
4230556	4231977	Do the babies run away?
4233919	4235981	A baby's hitchhiking to Texas.
4236881	4241145	If you ignore your baby, does virtual social services rep come and take them away?
4241165	4241325	Wait!
4243408	4247951	If you ignore your baby, then Child Protective Services comes and takes your baby away?
4248032	4248912	No, that was her joke.
4248932	4249312	Oh, oh.
4249332	4250573	I don't think that's actually what's going to happen.
4250593	4251154	Oh, my God.
4251234	4251734	Oh, I wish.
4251754	4253995	How would that be any different than the reality for some people?
4254015	4256917	I was going to say, if you're Britney Spears, you might be able to benefit from this game.
4256937	4260320	I love the picture that they have on this Wired blog thing.
4260400	4262221	It says, Baby Spotted You.
4263888	4264749	It's creepy looking.
4265049	4268971	But yeah, Baby Pals will be coming out for the DS in November.
4269312	4273795	In a big block of stuff that they have like all the pet series and sim raising shit.
4274075	4278458	So there's Imagine Babies and Baby Pals so far and I'm pretty sure there's going to be another one.
4279099	4283720	Now, Loki, I know you've said you and the wife are thinking about having a baby in the not-too-distant future, right?
4284140	4286160	So are you going to use this game as, like, a training?
4286880	4288881	I should make her play this.
4288921	4290381	You should buy it for Nelly.
4290781	4294402	Because I don't know where you're at on that one and have a baby thing.
4294662	4302263	But if maybe you want to hold off a little bit, I say buy this game for Nelly and make sure that Child Protective Services doesn't take her Ninten baby away.
4302283	4303363	I just want to buy this.
4304243	4308264	To me, this game poses the challenge of, like...
4309341	4309942	The Sims.
4310862	4316388	The Sims, you're supposed to make the family thrive and yada yada yada, but all I want to do in The Sims is try to kill them.
4317168	4323274	So in Baby Pals, you know, it's like, how can I possibly abuse these Sim babies?
4323394	4329880	I mean, just like in Nintendogs, you can kind of like, I don't know, throw the frisbee at their head and stuff.
4331702	4332082	It'd be fun.
4333792	4340176	Kiki just recently had a baby apparently and is saying, uh-huh, oh, she's born and sitting on my lap listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4340516	4341116	Be careful.
4341176	4342857	That could be minus points for the baby.
4345039	4348020	That may be one step closer to CPS coming down.
4348100	4348721	No, I'm just kidding.
4349181	4350082	Congratulations, though.
4350122	4350442	Seriously.
4351622	4352523	New babies are fun.
4352703	4354904	When they're real babies, they're good things.
4355064	4359207	When they're sim babies, they're stupid.
4359227	4361048	I have to say I've met a good baby.
4362133	4365815	My friend Becky, her baby, quiet, well-behaved.
4367475	4373098	Yeah, Ryoma says the baby's going to ask, Mommy, what's a girl boner?
4376239	4376599	Wow.
4377780	4378820	Oh, cool, Deakman.
4379060	4379961	Oh, it's Deakman.
4380041	4382462	Okay, it's Deakman's partner.
4382522	4384262	Kiki's my girlfriend, and that's my baby.
4384903	4385263	Okay.
4385503	4387504	Oh, the whole family's listening to OLR together.
4387544	4389284	That's so... One, two, three.
4389624	4390525	Aww.
4390545	4390665	Aww.
4392924	4393264	Wow.
4395947	4397868	Message to the baby, stop crying so much.
4398589	4400010	Mommy and daddy value their sleep.
4400771	4401211	Just kidding.
4402172	4403893	All right, let's move on with some news.
4404714	4408057	Moving on to a completely different field here, MMOs.
4408544	4410586	You know, people love their MMOs.
4411467	4414189	The World of Warcraft is still dominating as always.
4414249	4416991	But there's some other MMOs you may not have heard about.
4417892	4421075	RF Online is creating an MMO.
4421656	4425399	And the MMO is called... I'm sorry, RF Online is the game.
4425439	4428221	It's actually being made by Codemasters.
4429202	4432265	RF Online is now a free game.
4432905	4434707	The game came out back in 2006.
4436121	4436802	Thank you for watching!
4452782	4467468	If you want to check this game out, it looks, I don't know, I look at the screenshot, it looks a little bit like Phantasy Star-ish to me, because it looks like it's the real-time fighting, but I couldn't tell you, because I haven't played the game myself yet, but now that it's free, I might just have the incentive to do that.
4468268	4469068	So, check that out.
4469128	4472390	It's rf-onlinegame.com if you want more information.
4473670	4478812	Well, I have a little bit of information that will make lots and lots of people happy.
4479052	4479833	It makes me happy.
4480673	4480753	Um,
4481397	4482758	Night's has a date.
4485579	4489980	December 18th is going to be the release date for Night's Journey of Dreams.
4490740	4498463	And in the UK, well, actually, it just says Europe in general, will be January is when the release is, though there's not a specific date.
4500984	4504846	So sorry, Night's fans, but no Christmas for you overseas.
4505186	4508387	Did you watch the demo play for Night's?
4508942	4510743	I saw some screens, but I didn't watch the demo.
4510983	4513864	It's very, very, very cool.
4514045	4516226	I know you're a big fan of Nights.
4516446	4519267	Are you the one that told me Christmas Nights is one of your favorite games ever?
4519607	4522349	Well, we have a tradition in my house around Christmas.
4522389	4524550	We break out the Saturn, make sure the battery works.
4525430	4528992	Yeah, I lost all of my Symphony of the Night data.
4529252	4529972	I bet you were happy.
4530333	4532834	After I maxed out everything you can with Maria.
4533094	4534014	I bet you were very happy.
4534295	4534655	Oh, no.
4535195	4536876	But we play Christmas Nights every year.
4538349	4542352	We break out the Saturn in December and we play all the way through the dates.
4542932	4548657	The closer you get to Christmas, I think it's really cool that they change textures in it.
4548697	4549657	They change the music.
4549958	4550898	It starts snowing.
4550958	4553420	You get snow effects on the ground the closer you get to Christmas Day.
4554861	4555962	It's really cool.
4557784	4559445	Maybe they'll do something like that with this.
4559945	4560786	Maybe they'll do that here.
4561146	4561627	It'll be fun.
4561647	4561787	Anyhow.
4563516	4565116	Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas
4588510	4589390	on December 7th.
4589450	4599033	Tickets go on sale on November 5th and are available on the Alamo Drafthouse's website or www.drafthouse.com.
4600293	4604335	If you're in the area and want to go to the screen, be sure to pick up a ticket.
4604575	4616018	In attendance will be, let's see here, Fred Savage, Director Todd Holland, and let's see, Luke Edwards also will be there.
4617602	4624767	I love the Power Glove.
4624787	4627629	It's so bad.
4630311	4633833	Yeah, well, uh, just keep your Power Gloves off her, pal, huh?
4635995	4637836	Why is it that America loves the Wizard?
4638716	4639417	He grew up cute.
4640720	4641340	Fred Savage?
4641360	4646762	Yeah, didn't you see... He still has the same face.
4646782	4650744	He had a sitcom on NBC a while ago, too.
4654545	4657766	What is it about The Wizard that people still love to this day?
4658927	4660127	It's just The Wizard.
4660871	4661672	I mean, I don't know.
4679711	4682392	I wish they were doing this in more places than just Austin.
4703556	4710081	I mean, if they can do midnight showings of Showgirls, surely, surely they could put The Wizard in San Francisco for one night and people would come out.
4710101	4711503	Did you imagine having a shadow cast for The Wizard?
4712163	4713204	I don't even want to think about it.
4713584	4714185	No.
4715366	4717047	There's other movies I would rather see that done, too.
4718628	4723272	TigerClaw says, people love The Wizard because it's filled with so much Nintendo propaganda.
4723953	4726935	Rama in chat says, The Wizard ranks right up there with UHF.
4726975	4727896	It's a cult classic.
4728877	4730398	UHF is what I was proposed to over.
4731930	4733812	Ramma said also, it's a cult classic.
4734212	4736495	It's when they revealed Super Mario Bros.
4736935	4736495	3.
4736975	4739077	And I think a lot of us remember that from our childhood.
4739117	4741900	Like, a lot of us went to go see the movie just to freaking see Mario 3.
4741940	4743862	That was one of the reasons, yeah, that I went and saw it.
4743882	4744262	Me too.
4745043	4745323	Wow.
4746084	4746764	That's hardcore.
4746804	4749607	I'm providing a shopping service for our listeners in the chat room.
4749787	4750548	What shopping service?
4750568	4751108	Shopping service?
4751349	4753150	Yeah, people saying, I want a Saturn.
4753190	4754091	I was like, you want a Saturn?
4754111	4755212	You can buy one off eBay.
4755232	4755733	There's some eBay...
4756836	4759498	Use your hard-earned money to buy something off eBay right now.
4759719	4760719	I have two Saturns.
4760739	4763081	If you want something bad enough, you'll make it happen.
4763121	4768005	I have a Saturn that I'm willing to get rid of because it has no controllers and no cords or anything.
4768045	4768566	I'll take it.
4768646	4770447	I've got a bajillion controllers and cords.
4770747	4770967	Wow.
4770987	4772389	That'll be three Saturns in my house.
4773870	4774830	I need a Saturn.
4774911	4777433	I've barely played any Saturn games in my life.
4777453	4779034	That's what I need to play on a Saturn.
4779434	4780115	I think I have that.
4780515	4781476	Stahl is awesome.
4781576	4782917	Do you want to just borrow an extra set of...
4783615	4784536	controllers, of course.
4784716	4786377	Well, I have my first Saturn.
4786397	4787597	It has all the stuff for it.
4788038	4789499	I just don't have the second one.
4789539	4798184	Because I went to Denio's, a local flea market over here, and the first one I saw was the Saturn without anything because the guy was selling it for like $20.
4798604	4799965	I'm like, okay, I'll take it.
4800125	4801106	You went to Trader Dan's, right?
4801626	4805168	I don't remember, but then I went somewhere else and I found a Saturn with everything.
4805208	4808090	I'm like, okay, well, I'll just have a spare one in case it parts or something.
4808150	4808270	Yeah.
4809111	4810932	Of course, you have to replace your battery every month.
4811906	4819452	Wow, well now we're getting all nostalgic and what better time than to bring out DarkSakura's classic game of the week.
4819532	4831901	Yes, that's right, part A is coming to an end and this is the part of the show where we like to let DarkSakura reminisce a little bit about games you may have missed and I honestly think damn near everyone missed this game DarkSakura is going to do this week.
4832201	4838466	I'm kind of excited to hear a little more about it so I will stop the suspense, cue the music and let DarkSakura take it away.
4844673	4854562	Today's classic game slash obscure slash whatever game I pick of the week is Magical Fantasy Adventure Popful Mail.
4855563	4856404	Wow, that's a mouthful.
4856784	4857845	Yeah.
4857985	4864371	It was released originally on the PC-98 and PC-88 system in Japan.
4865492	4868815	And it's sort of like Ys.
4869915	4871716	You side-scroll adventure.
4871736	4872776	It has RPG elements.
4873077	4874037	You can change out your weapons.
4874057	4879060	You can change out your items and talk to people and all the stuff.
4880340	4887424	It was released in Japan afterwards on Super Famicom, on PC Engine CD, and on the Mega CD.
4887944	4891906	And over here, we actually got the Sega CD version thanks to Working Delays.
4892006	4892887	I mean, Working Designs.
4894207	4898269	Working Designs are also the lovely people that brought Silhouette Mirage, the...
4900624	4903046	Growlancer series, Lunar.
4904367	4907129	They were very, very good to us.
4908630	4914795	So in this game you were playing a little busty elven girl called Popple, no, called Mail.
4915775	4923261	And you play as her friends and you go around trying to, you know, save things.
4923321	4926784	Her friend the sorcerer Tat and the little dragon guy named Gaul.
4927484	4929666	And you fight bad guys called Nutscracker.
4930638	4931579	and Muttonhead.
4932379	4933780	There's a guy named Nutzcracker.
4933840	4934440	Nutzcracker.
4934560	4936561	I don't know if I like this guy.
4937522	4942705	And it's a pretty... Who's this that Mail's talking to right now in our little clip we're playing in the background?
4942765	4946106	He's just like the very start of the game.
4946126	4948368	Someone who's just going to help out.
4949308	4951189	Say, why do you take me with you?
4951589	4953090	I bet you have lots of adventures.
4953490	4957352	Why else would you have such a huge... I love the huge anime eyes and smile.
4957492	4958313	It's you?
4958946	4961147	I'm so hungry, I can eat an okra!
4961167	4963988	That's what it sounds like.
4964548	4968309	Well, the old CD games never had good music with them.
4968689	4969990	I mean, good voice acting.
4970010	4971030	Music was really good.
4971390	4973131	Actually, the voice acting wasn't really too bad.
4973171	4975031	They at least tried.
4975051	4981573	The problem I had with working designs is that they would put stuff into the game that just was not there and usually kind of crass humor.
4982233	4983694	Like with Rayearth.
4984534	4987155	Now, they actually made improvements when they brought out Rayearth on Saturn.
4988274	4998721	But, um, like, they took out the fact that they speak dialogue every time you touch an item, which cut down on the, uh, it had intense loading time on the game.
4999301	5004725	But they put in all these jokes, like there was one about, you know, Harry Palms.
5004825	5005105	Nice.
5005566	5008968	But, this was a fun game.
5009048	5010089	It was a lot of fun.
5010869	5016113	And, um, you know, it had the classic cutscenes and, you know, it's just very...
5017372	5020093	You know, mid-90s game fun.
5020133	5021274	I mean, that's all I can say it is.
5021714	5029537	And I actually was surprised with my copy because I had played it back in the day when a friend of mine had imported it.
5030977	5032698	And then, you know, it got its U.S.
5032778	5036379	release, and I didn't have a Sega CD at the time, so I never actually got it.
5036960	5041221	And one day, Dan came home with this huge box for me to open at Christmas.
5041761	5045383	And inside this huge box, it was supposed to be like a space heater.
5046326	5047828	was my game at the bottom of the box.
5048849	5049289	How funny.
5049729	5052132	I actually own an original Popful Mail now.
5052532	5052812	Awesome.
5052853	5058678	Well, that's a good game of the week because I bet a lot of people missed that one, but some folks in chat seem to recognize it and applaud that pick of the week.
5058718	5061301	Popful Mail is your classic game of the week.
5062066	5070772	And with that, Part A comes to a close, but fear not, we'll be back in just a little bit with Part B. So stay tuned, and thanks for downloading Orange Lounge Radio.
