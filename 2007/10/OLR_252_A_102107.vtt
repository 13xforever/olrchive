00:13.945 --> 00:26.148
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, October 21st, 2007, Street Fighter is back for more in SF4, Sega brings its characters to a new tennis game, and a classic video game movie returns to at least one big screen.

00:31.465 --> 00:36.468
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.488 --> 00:42.312
[SPEAKER_08]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.732 --> 00:43.753
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:43.933 --> 00:48.356
[SPEAKER_08]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.656 --> 00:48.876
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

00:49.336 --> 00:50.017
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Jamie?

00:50.497 --> 00:50.757
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.

00:51.258 --> 00:51.618
[SPEAKER_08]: You're here.

00:52.198 --> 00:52.718
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here too.

00:53.259 --> 00:54.520
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're here to talk about games.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.441
[SPEAKER_08]: Also joining us, the one and only Loki.

00:57.421 --> 00:57.541
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

00:57.562 --> 00:58.942
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, Loki?

00:59.203 --> 00:59.903
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fine.

01:00.219 --> 01:00.879
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero 3 Demo Kit

01:22.113 --> 01:27.677
[SPEAKER_06]: for Guitar Hero 360, except it's kind of rare because it is a wired version instead of wireless.

01:27.897 --> 01:28.298
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

01:28.518 --> 01:33.141
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I really give a damn if it's wireless or not, I mean, because that's one less battery I need, so.

01:33.722 --> 01:36.204
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, are we going to be unboxing that on Operator 11 a little later?

01:36.404 --> 01:36.904
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sure why not.

01:36.924 --> 01:37.605
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, sounds good.

01:38.174 --> 01:39.375
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen

02:07.779 --> 02:10.100
[SPEAKER_08]: Ragnarok What exactly does that mean in English?

02:33.906 --> 02:35.907
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

03:03.511 --> 03:05.773
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire Mage, who I'm building up to Sage.

03:06.493 --> 03:07.534
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two Assassins.

03:08.195 --> 03:11.317
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them hit level 91 this week.

03:12.839 --> 03:13.980
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a bunch of other people.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.441
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have a Dancer who looks like a Hoochie.

03:17.162 --> 03:17.462
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun.

03:17.783 --> 03:18.023
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

03:18.820 --> 03:21.080
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura and Korean MMOs

03:48.618 --> 03:59.881
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say, God, let me start off with, I played Conan on Xbox 360, and it's interesting.

04:00.601 --> 04:05.302
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually very much of a ripoff of God of War, but that's not a bad thing.

04:05.342 --> 04:06.622
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a pretty good game.

04:07.603 --> 04:13.244
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see, I also tried, of course, Beautiful Katamari, and I actually finished that game because it's very short.

04:14.451 --> 04:18.795
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I tried the, what else did I play here?

04:20.276 --> 04:22.498
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

04:23.058 --> 04:24.519
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried the demo for that.

04:25.420 --> 04:28.623
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's a good looking game.

04:29.624 --> 04:30.484
[SPEAKER_06]: The cars look good.

04:30.925 --> 04:35.068
[SPEAKER_06]: The track that they picked though to showcase it, I wouldn't have picked that one.

04:35.540 --> 04:35.880
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper Dolls

05:03.405 --> 05:05.746
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Project Gotham does the same thing, but you know what?

05:05.786 --> 05:07.786
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Gotham looks way better.

05:08.727 --> 05:20.130
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't really a huge deal right now because Project Gotham is only on 360, but a year from now when Project Gotham Racing 5 is probably going to be coming out and Gran Turismo 5 is coming out at the same time,

05:21.112 --> 05:22.693
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Gotham is a Microsoft IP Unlike Mass Effect

05:42.304 --> 05:43.045
[SPEAKER_08]: Project Gotham Racing

06:03.732 --> 06:06.674
[SPEAKER_06]: So, probably the PlayStation 3, it's going to be the same deal.

06:06.934 --> 06:17.121
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, you know, for them putting all this hype behind it and trying to even sell this kind of demo of a game before it comes out, you know, officially, I don't know.

06:17.181 --> 06:19.102
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that great.

06:19.162 --> 06:27.308
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're really dying to play some Gran Turismo, I highly recommend checking out the demo first and then judging it based off that, see if you want to buy it or not.

06:27.568 --> 06:28.989
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks good, but I just...

06:29.853 --> 06:37.241
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, after seeing the video, the video of it looked really, really nice, but when you're playing the game, it's not as nice, so I don't know.

06:39.202 --> 06:42.706
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think if there's anything else I played that was really awesome.

06:43.707 --> 06:48.632
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's pretty much it, other than, you know, Saints Row, because I've always been playing Saints Row now.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.741
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

07:11.508 --> 07:18.769
[SPEAKER_08]: There was just going to be huge crowds for all that stuff, and the media invites I was getting, not a lot of real wowing kind of stuff.

07:19.250 --> 07:25.851
[SPEAKER_08]: So I said, you know what, I'm going to just take a real vacation from both of my jobs, Orange Lounge Radio, my day job, and I'm going to go to Disneyland.

07:26.171 --> 07:32.092
[SPEAKER_08]: So I spent the week playing Buzz Lightyear once again, and I got the number 17 high score for the day one time I played.

07:32.112 --> 07:32.852
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a picture to prove it.

07:33.752 --> 07:36.553
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, no, but seriously, other video games I've been playing,

07:37.446 --> 07:44.012
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play Typing of the Dead before I left because I remember we had this story on the show a couple weeks ago where we were talking about how they added Typing of the Dead to GameTap.

07:44.032 --> 07:45.053
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I've got to go play that.

07:45.574 --> 07:48.857
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's still as wonderful as I remember it.

07:48.897 --> 07:51.580
[SPEAKER_08]: It runs great on the computer, so I was very happy about that.

07:52.340 --> 07:58.587
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though it is the PC version that GameTap is emulating, not the Dreamcast version, but they still do have the Dreamcast strapped to their backs.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.069
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the part we all know and love.

08:02.240 --> 08:11.871
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, a large majority of my gaming week otherwise was spent playing E4, the other E4, not the Expo, but Every Extend Extra Extreme, which came out on Xbox Live this week.

08:12.850 --> 08:14.071
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:35.172 --> 08:38.774
[SPEAKER_08]: Your shields are only on for about two seconds once you regenerate.

08:39.254 --> 08:42.015
[SPEAKER_08]: After those two seconds are up, anything on the screen can kill you.

08:42.375 --> 08:45.156
[SPEAKER_08]: So you want to commit suicide before something on the screen kills you.

08:45.456 --> 08:48.157
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if something on the screen kills you, you basically have to go back to start.

08:48.758 --> 08:53.560
[SPEAKER_08]: The game time is limited to three minutes, but you can collect power-ups throughout the game.

08:53.880 --> 09:03.484
[SPEAKER_08]: You can collect a power-up to extend your game time, a power-up to extend your shield time, a power-up to make things float on the screen faster and increase the beats of the song.

09:03.504 --> 09:04.484
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what they call the quicken.

09:05.200 --> 09:17.709
[SPEAKER_08]: or you can pick a power up that increases your bonus multiplier and basically that's essentially the core component of the game so you know you get higher and higher bonuses if you actually detonate your ship in time to the music now it's a game by

09:18.502 --> 09:21.864
[SPEAKER_08]: Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who did Luminous and a bunch of other stuff I love.

09:22.625 --> 09:27.448
[SPEAKER_08]: And I played every cent extra on the PSP, so I knew I was going to like this game, and I do.

09:27.508 --> 09:28.388
[SPEAKER_08]: The game has a lot of depth.

09:28.408 --> 09:31.210
[SPEAKER_08]: It has the regular game mode, and then it has a shooter mode.

09:31.270 --> 09:35.213
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called the Revenge mode, where you can go around and actually just... It's just a shooter.

09:35.713 --> 09:37.774
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't even bother with the music or the exploding.

09:37.834 --> 09:38.975
[SPEAKER_08]: It just shoots things.

09:39.495 --> 09:40.376
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was kind of interesting.

09:40.736 --> 09:41.757
[SPEAKER_08]: But then there's another mode.

09:42.521 --> 10:06.328
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty intricate the way they set it up, but you can actually, using the whole media center and doing the MP3s on your Xbox 360 through the network, you can actually configure Every Extent Extra Extreme to read those songs, and you can work with the game to either auto-detect the BPM or set the BPM by button tapping or whatever, so you can use your own songs in the game, which is kind of cool.

10:06.348 --> 10:08.649
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of fun to be able to play the game with your own songs.

10:09.130 --> 10:09.730
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:28.010 --> 10:33.191
[SPEAKER_08]: The game did not increment in stages, and I realized maybe that's a different game.

10:33.211 --> 10:44.654
[SPEAKER_08]: This wasn't necessarily supposed to be a direct port of the PSP version, but I kind of liked that better when there was that more sense of accomplishment as opposed to the fact of, I've survived for 70 minutes now and my thumbs are getting numb, so I'm just going to suicide, which is what I ended up doing.

10:46.894 --> 10:53.856
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing that actually kind of makes me wonder why they chose to do this in the game is that the graphics aren't that good.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.263
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was kind of surprised.

10:56.403 --> 11:06.287
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, compared to the PSP version, which has these very bright visuals and different types of backgrounds and different skins, eh, I kind of felt that this game just had white on black.

11:06.847 --> 11:12.229
[SPEAKER_08]: And the types of objects that would float around the screen would change depending on what stage you were playing.

11:12.910 --> 11:16.091
[SPEAKER_08]: And the little ships that, you know, get into it as well.

11:16.671 --> 11:17.591
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really about it.

11:17.651 --> 11:19.452
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the backgrounds don't change too much.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.253
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, when you set off big combos...

11:21.553 --> 11:22.434
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:48.749 --> 11:51.071
[SPEAKER_08]: After 70 minutes of playing one round of this game.

11:51.551 --> 11:53.312
[SPEAKER_08]: So it kind of didn't add up to a lot.

11:53.332 --> 11:54.613
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was a bit of a disappointment.

11:55.113 --> 11:58.515
[SPEAKER_08]: But overall, I think it is a good value for money, especially if you're not a PSP owner.

11:58.896 --> 11:59.856
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is a fun game.

12:00.617 --> 12:03.279
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play a little bit of Luminous because they have the new content.

12:03.599 --> 12:08.222
[SPEAKER_08]: I neglected to download the holiday pack, but I did download the new Genkai Rocket song, Breeze.

12:09.281 --> 12:10.281
[SPEAKER_08]: Mediocre at best.

12:10.521 --> 12:25.907
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not enjoy Breeze, which is sad because I love, love, love, love, love Heavenly Star and I love the video, but Breeze is basically the same concept for the video, the cartoon Asian girl bouncing around, which makes sense because Genkai Rockets is supposed to be like a... Genki.

12:26.267 --> 12:26.727
[SPEAKER_08]: Genki, sorry.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.588
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be like a cartoony band or whatever it is.

12:30.068 --> 12:30.708
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't know.

12:31.309 --> 12:32.209
[SPEAKER_06]: Cartoon heroes did it.

12:33.988 --> 12:36.949
[SPEAKER_08]: So did Gorillaz, but you know, it's just, at least, Gorillaz did it best.

12:37.289 --> 12:39.029
[SPEAKER_08]: There's different, well, you're a fangirl.

12:39.289 --> 12:42.610
[SPEAKER_08]: There's different, there's variants in the Gorillaz videos.

12:42.750 --> 12:43.251
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

12:43.471 --> 12:44.831
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, their videos are all different.

12:45.511 --> 12:47.532
[SPEAKER_08]: Say what you will, like, dislike, all the videos are different.

12:47.572 --> 12:51.633
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, actually, actually, the videos only got different when you got to Demon Days.

12:52.393 --> 12:54.214
[SPEAKER_04]: The first album ones were not different.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.634
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they need to vary it up a little bit.

12:56.674 --> 13:03.356
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, they couldn't keep that level of, you know, I mean, Heavenly Star and, you know, Shinen were both really good, and, you know,

13:04.198 --> 13:06.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually, they're going to have to have a mediocre song.

13:07.499 --> 13:09.140
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, going to chat room for some comments.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.680
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

13:10.720 --> 13:15.122
[SPEAKER_08]: Picaruno says, the new seasonal Luminous Life Pack is awesome and you should buy it right now.

13:15.942 --> 13:18.563
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard good things about it, so I'm contemplating buying it.

13:18.583 --> 13:18.843
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

13:18.884 --> 13:22.465
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as I don't have any speed mixes of fucking Christmas songs.

13:22.965 --> 13:23.645
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes, please no.

13:23.665 --> 13:24.786
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at you, Dance Mania.

13:24.806 --> 13:26.086
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at you.

13:26.686 --> 13:30.848
[SPEAKER_08]: Gerardimo says, they're trying to set you up with microtransactions like in Luminous.

13:31.108 --> 13:31.528
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

13:31.848 --> 13:33.489
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's where my backgrounds are.

13:34.087 --> 13:35.968
[SPEAKER_08]: There are going to be microtransactions later on.

13:35.988 --> 13:36.668
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I refuse.

13:36.709 --> 13:39.230
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm putting my foot down this time on the microtransactions, damn it.

13:40.010 --> 13:41.791
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're paying less than a penny?

13:44.473 --> 13:52.157
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, look, I know we've had this discussion about micro and macrotransactions, but that's, you know, despite, it's still what people call it.

13:54.479 --> 13:56.660
[SPEAKER_08]: Gerardimo's also still having fun with the E4 demo.

13:58.401 --> 13:59.882
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya says, Loki, what?

13:59.962 --> 14:01.743
[SPEAKER_08]: Speed Mix of Jingle Bells doesn't do it for you?

14:02.083 --> 14:02.624
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it doesn't.

14:03.044 --> 14:03.364
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't.

14:04.369 --> 14:09.431
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, oh, GS68 would also like to point out, speeding up a song does not equal a remix.

14:10.572 --> 14:11.092
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

14:12.313 --> 14:14.134
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, well that's going to do it for our gaming weeks.

14:14.774 --> 14:17.655
[SPEAKER_04]: But adding heavy synth to it does make it Eurobeat.

14:18.335 --> 14:18.696
[SPEAKER_08]: It might.

14:19.516 --> 14:22.017
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, having some guy singing about fire.

14:22.177 --> 14:25.179
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever a fire, just insert blank of fire and it's instant Eurobeat.

14:25.199 --> 14:28.240
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we'll get into remix stuff later on.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.221
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some complaints with certain artists out there.

14:31.381 --> 14:32.442
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my, alright.

14:33.101 --> 14:38.706
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I mention that Luminous does have, or I'm sorry, not Luminous, Every Stand Extra Extreme does have a remix of Heavenly Star in it.

14:40.207 --> 14:40.828
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that great.

14:41.168 --> 14:41.588
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to say.

14:41.608 --> 14:42.949
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably have already heard it too.

14:43.270 --> 14:43.510
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

14:44.331 --> 14:44.571
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.154
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go into tonight's news.

14:48.194 --> 14:49.595
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have a lot of housekeeping tonight.

14:50.353 --> 14:53.114
[SPEAKER_08]: I will therefore use the opportunity to plug our communities.

14:53.614 --> 14:55.695
[SPEAKER_08]: MySpace.com slash OrangeLaunchRadio.

14:55.775 --> 14:57.175
[SPEAKER_08]: Add us as your friend on MySpace.

14:57.595 --> 14:59.216
[SPEAKER_08]: We post bulletins with extra stuff.

14:59.436 --> 15:07.338
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually did a whole bonus show last week because of our outage after the show, and so we posted it to our MySpace people and the LiveJournal people at Orange Lounge.

15:07.779 --> 15:17.647
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have a community on Facebook, but I've been irritated with Facebook lately because I'm getting sick of getting the invites for So-and-so wants you to be on their team for quiz show.

15:18.007 --> 15:21.050
[SPEAKER_08]: So-and-so wants you to join them in the battle of ninjas versus pirates.

15:21.130 --> 15:25.913
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, this so-and-so doesn't give two shits and is thinking about deleting his account.

15:25.933 --> 15:29.516
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear that the Mass Effect characters are now on Facebook looking for friends?

15:29.776 --> 15:32.238
[SPEAKER_08]: I could give a shit, honestly.

15:32.659 --> 15:34.320
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they find no friends on Facebook.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.435
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not happy with Facebook.

15:36.455 --> 15:46.762
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook was cool like six months ago before they started adding all the... Like, you would think usually user-created mods are a good thing for almost everything you can think of.

15:47.362 --> 15:48.383
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Facebook.

15:49.755 --> 15:56.278
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook is somehow proven that user-enabled created mods can single-handedly make your site suck balls.

15:56.398 --> 15:59.460
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like user-created themes for Myspace.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.661
[SPEAKER_08]: Now everybody's yelling at me to just block the applications.

16:02.981 --> 16:04.322
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I block everything?

16:04.682 --> 16:07.103
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just put, is there like a box, block everything?

16:07.563 --> 16:08.204
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'll do that.

16:08.424 --> 16:09.564
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even know that was a feature.

16:09.825 --> 16:10.825
[SPEAKER_08]: See, this is why I love chat.

16:11.245 --> 16:12.226
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat educates me.

16:12.526 --> 16:15.867
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I will check Facebook right now while we get into some gaming news.

16:16.348 --> 16:16.988
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's start off.

16:17.637 --> 16:23.761
[SPEAKER_06]: So during this week, there was a wonderful event in London, Capcom's Gamers Day.

16:24.442 --> 16:29.565
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, their bombshell announcement for that event would be Street Fighter 4.

16:29.765 --> 16:31.247
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it's coming.

16:32.267 --> 16:34.849
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not too surprised that there's a Street Fighter 4.

16:34.989 --> 16:37.911
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like saying there's not going to be a Halo 4 or something like that.

16:37.971 --> 16:38.532
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

16:38.992 --> 16:40.873
[SPEAKER_06]: But, okay, it is Street Fighter 4.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.695
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to continue with the 2D series.

16:43.995 --> 16:46.317
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be 3D, so far at least.

16:47.253 --> 16:47.693
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God.

16:48.033 --> 16:48.674
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good thing.

17:00.089 --> 17:02.291
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, I'm sorry, the teaser video was lame.

17:02.691 --> 17:07.755
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was nothing more than like a hype the crowd type thing where I'm sitting there watching it on the computer.

17:07.795 --> 17:09.456
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking, show me the game.

17:09.977 --> 17:14.220
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate these stupid cinematic, like teasers that are nothing but cinematics, the CGI rendering.

17:14.460 --> 17:17.963
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in a day and an age of gaming where we know that's just all the BS cut scenes.

17:18.283 --> 17:20.045
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I want to see some actual game.

17:20.145 --> 17:25.589
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awesome though if it was in that art style because it was kind of like a watercolor type thing, but no.

17:26.830 --> 17:26.990
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

17:27.403 --> 17:29.428
[SPEAKER_06]: Street Fighter 4, it's going to be a fighting game.

17:29.488 --> 17:33.518
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll probably be awesome and out sometime, someday.

17:34.681 --> 17:35.142
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

17:36.235 --> 17:39.297
[SPEAKER_08]: Now let's see, GS68 says nobody will play Street Fighter 4.

17:39.417 --> 17:42.219
[SPEAKER_08]: Arcade scene has been reduced down to initial D4.

17:42.680 --> 17:43.000
[SPEAKER_08]: And when?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.361
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, Midnight Maximum 2 and 3.

17:44.601 --> 17:46.062
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, people will play Street Fighter 4.

17:46.342 --> 17:49.024
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, because they're not going to gun for the arcades necessarily.

17:49.224 --> 17:52.226
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to use Xbox Live and PlayStation Network to get people to play.

17:52.246 --> 17:53.367
[SPEAKER_06]: People will still play the damn arcades.

17:53.387 --> 17:53.908
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.369
[SPEAKER_06]: People still play tech in there.

17:55.709 --> 17:56.670
[SPEAKER_06]: People still go to the arcades.

17:56.690 --> 17:58.211
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why there's still arcades out there.

17:58.231 --> 18:01.433
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not as many arcades because arcade games have gotten more expensive.

18:01.753 --> 18:04.675
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't have the foot traffic, you're not going to be able to pay for your $6,000 game.

18:06.096 --> 18:09.358
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's why arcades are failing.

18:09.758 --> 18:15.441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not because, you know, people stopped going to them, it's just that games got more expensive.

18:16.342 --> 18:22.205
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of curiosity, why would I bother to go to an arcade if I can just plug it in on my Xbox 360 and sign into live and play?

18:22.545 --> 18:25.686
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the D-pad sucks on Xbox 360.

18:25.786 --> 18:26.407
[SPEAKER_08]: Ouch, good point.

18:27.707 --> 18:28.228
[SPEAKER_08]: Touche.

18:28.268 --> 18:30.149
[SPEAKER_04]: What can ever replace the arcade experience?

18:30.976 --> 18:31.556
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

18:31.696 --> 18:36.938
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know this is interesting coming from me on this program when you consider the three of us all met, how?

18:37.078 --> 18:37.938
[SPEAKER_08]: At an arcade, right?

18:38.339 --> 18:45.841
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, arcades, as they're saying in chat, they really have become nothing but gambling for children and the ticket spitters.

18:46.121 --> 18:46.701
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sad.

18:47.161 --> 18:54.304
[SPEAKER_08]: Like every good arcade I've ever known is gone or replaced with something that is under the disguise of a good arcade, but it's not.

18:55.824 --> 18:56.165
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

18:57.045 --> 18:57.465
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sad.

18:58.393 --> 18:59.013
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you excited?

18:59.054 --> 19:02.456
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're a Capcom Fighting Girl fan, DarkSakura.

19:02.476 --> 19:03.797
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you excited about Street Fighter 4?

19:04.157 --> 19:04.718
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah!

19:04.938 --> 19:06.859
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you hope they do differently this time?

19:07.220 --> 19:08.020
[SPEAKER_04]: Take out Chun-Li.

19:09.141 --> 19:10.382
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they can't do that!

19:10.642 --> 19:11.403
[SPEAKER_04]: And put in Sakura.

19:12.163 --> 19:14.105
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would... They would never take out Chun-Li.

19:14.145 --> 19:14.905
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would they do that?

19:15.186 --> 19:17.067
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm sick of all of the fanboyism.

19:17.727 --> 19:18.248
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

19:18.808 --> 19:24.933
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like... Okay, her moves are all... She's like... I'm trying to...

19:26.014 --> 19:26.775
[SPEAKER_04]: Oro He needs to leave

19:53.164 --> 19:55.585
[SPEAKER_06]: He needs to come back but missing another arm.

19:55.985 --> 19:56.885
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a leg or something.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.365
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be awesome.

19:58.385 --> 19:59.285
[SPEAKER_06]: The joke will continue.

19:59.305 --> 20:00.406
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then he'd be Elena.

20:01.906 --> 20:02.546
[SPEAKER_04]: And fight with his legs.

20:03.166 --> 20:03.907
[SPEAKER_04]: She was cool too.

20:04.007 --> 20:04.787
[SPEAKER_04]: She needs to come back.

20:05.947 --> 20:13.069
[SPEAKER_04]: And they need to actually have... Do they have any characters in the game who use Taekwondo?

20:13.709 --> 20:16.349
[SPEAKER_08]: FootyMonster says, DarkSakura, fuck you.

20:16.430 --> 20:18.310
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave my beautiful thunder thighs alone.

20:20.424 --> 20:22.185
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I have kick power, thank you.

20:22.265 --> 20:29.369
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they should take Street Fighter 4 and actually add other Capcom characters into it instead of just this Capcom versus shit.

20:29.909 --> 20:32.871
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you'd have Puzzle Fighter.

20:33.611 --> 20:36.433
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Puzzle Fighter, but Pocket Fighter.

20:37.578 --> 20:40.900
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all fine with them putting in new characters.

20:41.260 --> 20:43.421
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not have some new characters to sell?

20:43.741 --> 20:45.622
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Soul Calibur 3 kind of did it.

20:45.642 --> 20:48.824
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the guy with the big old sickle and stuff.

20:49.464 --> 20:50.785
[SPEAKER_08]: They're able to sell out new characters.

20:51.045 --> 20:53.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, don't follow the route of Tekken 6.

20:53.987 --> 20:57.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Bob, the fat guy that sort of looks like Mario.

20:58.009 --> 21:00.390
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's not a cool character.

21:00.830 --> 21:01.951
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I would like to see?

21:02.831 --> 21:04.112
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see a tag mode.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.221
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the versus games.

21:08.681 --> 21:09.641
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be cool.

21:09.661 --> 21:16.464
[SPEAKER_04]: I also really wouldn't mind just another Capcom versus game that isn't like, what was it, Fighting Evolution.

21:16.604 --> 21:25.187
[SPEAKER_04]: I want them to go back to the Marvel versus Capcom style that they did because that was probably one of their most solid fighting games.

21:25.247 --> 21:27.588
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to have like a, you know what they need to do?

21:28.628 --> 21:30.969
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of doing Street Fighter 4, we need another freaking Cyberbots.

21:32.715 --> 21:35.576
[SPEAKER_08]: Blaze in our chatroom is getting in on the Capcom crossover madness.

21:35.616 --> 21:38.896
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth in Street Fighter 4.

21:40.117 --> 21:40.597
[SPEAKER_08]: Objection.

21:40.637 --> 21:46.978
[SPEAKER_06]: They should just do a new game series called Capcom Versus and then do a new installment each year.

21:47.198 --> 21:50.679
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think they should focus on Street Fighter 4 and making it good.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.740
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think they should do any of this crossover bullshit.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.880
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they should focus on making a new, original, fun game.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.461
[SPEAKER_04]: To talk to Son of Dad for a moment...

22:00.101 --> 22:06.204
[SPEAKER_04]: They, first of all, the Final Fight characters were in the Alpha series and that is, it's a different type of game.

22:06.244 --> 22:08.105
[SPEAKER_04]: It plays different than how 3 was.

22:08.145 --> 22:11.366
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I kind of liked how 3 was with the parrying system.

22:11.406 --> 22:12.987
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was cool and that needs to stay.

22:14.668 --> 22:19.730
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially because I have one time parried a Shoryuken, so that was really cool.

22:19.750 --> 22:20.651
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my awesome moment.

22:22.592 --> 22:26.914
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that they need to have a few more unique styles.

22:27.214 --> 22:27.914
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was really good.

22:27.934 --> 22:29.115
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a boxer in there.

22:29.175 --> 22:29.615
[SPEAKER_04]: They had

22:30.396 --> 22:33.878
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the stupid one-armed guy that kind of grossed me out.

22:33.918 --> 22:35.418
[SPEAKER_04]: They need a luchador.

22:36.019 --> 22:36.719
[SPEAKER_04]: They need a luchador.

22:37.279 --> 22:37.999
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they had one.

22:38.039 --> 22:39.440
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Vega.

22:39.980 --> 22:41.421
[SPEAKER_06]: He wasn't really a luchador, though.

22:41.501 --> 22:42.001
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not luchador.

22:42.021 --> 22:44.002
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking Matador.

22:44.222 --> 22:45.643
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they do need a luchador.

22:45.663 --> 22:47.103
[SPEAKER_04]: They need Mexican wrestling.

22:48.424 --> 22:48.944
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be cool.

22:50.405 --> 22:50.765
[SPEAKER_04]: They need...

22:51.445 --> 22:57.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was Armika in... In fact, Scrooge is a luchador.

22:57.946 --> 22:59.026
[SPEAKER_06]: They just need Santo in there.

23:00.387 --> 23:10.388
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they need to... Oh, God, they need a... Well, not like a wrestler-wrestler, but they need like a big brawler.

23:10.608 --> 23:14.769
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like Zangief was, but just like this brute character.

23:15.169 --> 23:15.929
[SPEAKER_04]: Like T-Hawk?

23:16.489 --> 23:17.390
[SPEAKER_04]: No, T-Hawk was a wrestler.

23:17.790 --> 23:17.890
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

23:18.650 --> 23:19.250
[SPEAKER_04]: They need this...

23:21.801 --> 23:25.665
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like the slow, like, oh god, who was it in Darkstalkers?

23:25.785 --> 23:28.087
[SPEAKER_08]: Suddenly this game's turning into Saturday Night Slammasters.

23:29.342 --> 23:35.006
[SPEAKER_04]: They need something like that, where they're slow and tough, but that's just the thing.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.388
[SPEAKER_04]: They're slow and tough, and that's what's frustrating about them.

23:37.408 --> 23:38.509
[SPEAKER_06]: Do another Darkstalkers game.

23:38.529 --> 23:39.490
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be kind of cool.

23:39.650 --> 23:41.311
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a good Darkstalkers game.

23:41.351 --> 23:44.834
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I love these comments from chat rooms on the crossover games.

23:44.894 --> 23:46.556
[SPEAKER_08]: GS68 says, Fuck crossovers.

23:46.616 --> 23:47.737
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop feeding the fanboys.

23:48.177 --> 23:51.319
[SPEAKER_08]: Sephiroth1215 says, Street Fighter is only for Street Fighter characters.

23:51.660 --> 23:52.941
[SPEAKER_08]: You want other Capcom characters?

23:53.001 --> 23:54.342
[SPEAKER_08]: Play the Wacky Versus series.

23:55.714 --> 23:59.388
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I was hoping they'd come out with another Sega Versus series.

24:00.695 --> 24:03.417
[SPEAKER_08]: All I have to say is thank God they're sticking with 2D.

24:03.717 --> 24:08.421
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I seem to remember there was a 3D Street Fighter game, like Rosal Golfland had it, didn't they?

24:08.461 --> 24:11.444
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was, oh God, it was so horrible.

24:11.804 --> 24:16.267
[SPEAKER_04]: Son of Dad is saying exactly what I was thinking, that they need more unique styles in the game.

24:16.728 --> 24:29.658
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, just to talk to Hitson, I actually like Darkstalkers 3, and I've actually played it where all the character sprites on the screen were missing because my employer at the time when I worked for an arcade was fixing it while I was playing it.

24:30.766 --> 24:31.867
[SPEAKER_04]: and be the game that way.

24:32.648 --> 24:36.292
[SPEAKER_04]: But... Fighters Megamix 2.

24:36.453 --> 24:37.133
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.

24:37.774 --> 24:38.315
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you.

24:38.415 --> 24:39.716
[SPEAKER_08]: The chat reminded me.

24:39.756 --> 24:41.098
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking of the EX series.

24:41.138 --> 24:42.059
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the 3D ones.

24:42.199 --> 24:45.122
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and Dark Knight reminds me that Capcom didn't do the 3D ones.

24:45.483 --> 24:45.643
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

24:45.823 --> 24:47.826
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they should sue whoever did it.

24:48.526 --> 24:48.847
[SPEAKER_08]: Again.

24:49.628 --> 24:55.152
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because people actually remember how horrible those games are, so they should sue them again if they haven't already.

24:55.292 --> 25:00.616
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what game that I would like for them to make, and this is what I would totally call it too, is Capcom Fighting Universe.

25:02.057 --> 25:03.898
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a big clusterfuck of every character ever?

25:04.118 --> 25:05.539
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your Rival Schools characters.

25:05.719 --> 25:06.160
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh lordy.

25:06.300 --> 25:10.603
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your Alpha characters, you have your She-Fighter 3, you have your Cyberbots.

25:10.623 --> 25:12.784
[SPEAKER_06]: They did something like that though.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.626
[SPEAKER_06]: Fan girl alert, fan girl alert.

25:14.646 --> 25:17.508
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was like Capcom Fighting Evolution or something like that.

25:17.528 --> 25:18.268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that game sucked.

25:18.328 --> 25:18.989
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't the best of.

25:19.594 --> 25:20.875
[SPEAKER_04]: Capcom Fighting Evolution sucked.

25:22.137 --> 25:28.063
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to just do... Get the wolf from Akami, get the guy from Dead Rising.

25:28.243 --> 25:31.607
[SPEAKER_04]: You choose your mode at the beginning of the game and everyone fights in the same mode.

25:32.321 --> 25:34.541
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, too much fanboy stuff for me.

25:34.581 --> 25:36.362
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to move on with the other Capcom news.

25:36.542 --> 25:40.923
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of the wolf from Okami, Okami for the Wii has been confirmed.

25:41.223 --> 25:43.623
[SPEAKER_08]: Okami is coming to the Nintendo Wii in the spring of 2008.

25:45.084 --> 25:49.204
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've played Okami, it's the kind of game that really could benefit from some motion controls.

25:49.705 --> 25:52.825
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly the game will be making use of the Wiimote controls.

25:53.125 --> 25:56.746
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion controls will be used primarily for the Celestial Brush game.

25:57.435 --> 26:03.379
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually excited about this because Okami's kind of one of those games everybody said I should play and I didn't really get to play enough of.

26:03.459 --> 26:08.643
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, there was just so many games coming out around that time, so this kind of allows a lot of people like me to take a second look.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.845
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like when Resident Evil 4 came out for the Wii.

26:11.365 --> 26:11.846
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing.

26:11.906 --> 26:13.427
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a good choice for them to bring it there.

26:14.187 --> 26:17.290
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's an excellent choice, so I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out.

26:17.350 --> 26:18.070
[SPEAKER_06]: Okami on the Wii.

26:18.330 --> 26:21.873
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and this is kind of off the subject a little bit, but...

26:23.620 --> 26:32.947
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised they haven't brought Beautiful Joe to the Wii, but then that made me think, how much do you want to bet that there might be a character announced that's Beautiful Joe for Super Smash Bros.?

26:34.448 --> 26:34.969
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

26:35.329 --> 26:35.669
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

26:35.789 --> 26:38.151
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they did have that game that was sort of like Smash Bros.

26:38.171 --> 26:43.575
[SPEAKER_08]: with Beautiful Joe, but... I think Beautiful Joe's on ice for a little bit, and that's just fine, because, like... It sucked.

26:43.795 --> 26:48.419
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it started good, but then it was one of those, like, saturation...

26:49.406 --> 26:51.407
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but it got too oversaturated.

26:51.427 --> 26:56.388
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think Capcom's doing the smart thing right now, and Beautiful Joe, at least it seems to me anyway, is on ice for a little while.

26:56.788 --> 26:57.688
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just fine by me.

26:58.328 --> 26:59.229
[SPEAKER_08]: The series needs to be on ice.

26:59.489 --> 27:02.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there is a little bit more good Capcom news.

27:02.830 --> 27:10.992
[SPEAKER_04]: They have released word about a game called Dark Void that will be out next winter, developed by Airtight Games.

27:11.392 --> 27:13.853
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave us Crimson Skies, High Road to Revenge.

27:14.573 --> 27:17.134
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is supposed to be...

27:18.456 --> 27:19.757
[SPEAKER_04]: Midair and On Foot.

27:21.158 --> 27:25.922
[SPEAKER_04]: And they haven't said what it's going to be on, although they're thinking PS3 and Xbox 360.

27:26.682 --> 27:31.646
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a game where you go against these... They're called the Watchers.

27:32.547 --> 27:33.407
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've been watching.

27:33.728 --> 27:36.750
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they stopped watching and are doing... What have they been watching me do?

27:36.970 --> 27:37.270
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn.

27:38.471 --> 27:38.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, noes.

27:39.592 --> 27:41.453
[SPEAKER_04]: Ceiling Watchers are watching you fap.

27:43.035 --> 27:43.435
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, noes.

27:45.888 --> 27:47.449
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hooray for original ideas, right?

27:47.469 --> 27:49.770
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this is a whole new IP for them, right?

27:50.070 --> 27:51.731
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a new world.

27:51.991 --> 27:52.331
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, good.

27:53.391 --> 28:00.034
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, folks that may have owned a PS3 and not a 360 have missed out on the Lost Planet series.

28:00.054 --> 28:00.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fear not.

28:01.015 --> 28:02.996
[SPEAKER_06]: Capcom... Unless you owned a computer.

28:04.076 --> 28:05.056
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you owned a PC.

28:05.457 --> 28:07.518
[SPEAKER_06]: But who owns a PC nowadays?

28:07.578 --> 28:08.378
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

28:08.898 --> 28:09.538
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody.

28:11.279 --> 28:12.300
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody owns a computer.

28:12.320 --> 28:13.920
[SPEAKER_06]: Who plays games on PCs anymore?

28:13.960 --> 28:15.221
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just ridiculous talk.

28:16.084 --> 28:16.324
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

28:17.044 --> 28:19.425
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but seriously, Lost Planet's coming to the PS3.

28:19.445 --> 28:26.647
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have all the features and download content that was available for the PC and Xbox 360 versions.

28:27.027 --> 28:29.388
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to come out in the spring, so... Hooray!

28:29.508 --> 28:31.609
[SPEAKER_06]: You get your Lost Planet almost a year later.

28:34.870 --> 28:36.250
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they doing anything extra for it?

28:36.450 --> 28:37.031
[SPEAKER_08]: Extra levels?

28:37.131 --> 28:37.811
[SPEAKER_08]: Extra characters?

28:37.931 --> 28:39.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Extra... Just the download content.

28:39.531 --> 28:40.192
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it.

28:40.212 --> 28:41.632
[SPEAKER_06]: The stuff that was available later on.

28:41.912 --> 28:42.292
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean... So...

28:46.520 --> 28:47.940
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really that extra, I guess.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.141
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all the bonus stuff that was available already.

28:50.481 --> 28:51.441
[SPEAKER_08]: No dress-up mode?

28:52.362 --> 28:52.502
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

28:53.282 --> 28:53.542
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

28:53.962 --> 28:54.402
[SPEAKER_08]: That's too bad.

28:54.462 --> 28:59.704
[SPEAKER_06]: It says apparently now that it can fit all that stuff on the Blu-ray disc, so that's why it wasn't downloaded content now.

29:00.184 --> 29:01.824
[SPEAKER_08]: I like SonOfDad's comment in chat.

29:01.864 --> 29:06.386
[SPEAKER_08]: SonOfDad says in chat, chat.orangeonjuray.com, Lost Planet PlayStation 3?

29:07.206 --> 29:07.606
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

29:08.166 --> 29:09.447
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Rising PlayStation 3?

29:09.487 --> 29:09.547
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

29:12.008 --> 29:12.968
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be sweet.

29:13.388 --> 29:24.310
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, if they're looking for a game that would take advantage of their little Shaker controller like an idiot function, then Dead Rising would be a good one to look at.

29:24.651 --> 29:26.971
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing, and this is kind of good news for you guys.

29:27.031 --> 29:34.412
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think about it, I would think that they would pick Dead Rising over Lost Planet anyways because I think Dead Rising sold more anyways.

29:36.093 --> 29:36.773
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means...

29:37.743 --> 29:44.525
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, that means that they're making a sequel, so instead of porting the original, they're just going to make a sequel for both platforms.

29:44.545 --> 29:46.426
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, duh, they've got to be making a sequel.

29:46.466 --> 29:48.666
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, how could they not be making a sequel to Dead Rising?

29:48.986 --> 29:53.168
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, please God, fix the damn save system, because that was horrible.

29:53.388 --> 29:56.169
[SPEAKER_06]: I stopped playing the game because of that, sadly.

29:56.789 --> 30:00.290
[SPEAKER_06]: That and the fact that my monitor sucked at the time, so I couldn't see anything in the dark.

30:00.870 --> 30:03.751
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, fix the save system.

30:04.656 --> 30:08.178
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix

30:28.490 --> 30:31.031
[SPEAKER_08]: The HD remix, of course, supports widescreen.

30:31.331 --> 30:32.491
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of figured that would happen.

30:32.771 --> 30:37.753
[SPEAKER_08]: The music has all been completely remixed for the game, which doesn't actually surprise me too much.

30:37.793 --> 30:38.873
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we needed that, too.

30:40.273 --> 30:49.216
[SPEAKER_08]: There will also be, however, not just the HD version, but an arcade mirror of the Super Street Fighter II Turbo arcade version.

30:49.256 --> 30:52.837
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want your purist version, that will be included in the game.

30:53.697 --> 30:57.660
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, apparently, some balancing has gone into effect, some rebalancing.

30:57.700 --> 31:05.986
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if that means some attacks do more damages, or some characters' movements are different, or what have you, but there has been some rebalancing done.

31:06.367 --> 31:09.469
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the first time Capcom's gone back and rebalanced one of their games.

31:09.549 --> 31:13.832
[SPEAKER_08]: Just take a look at Puzzle Fighter 2, had some rebalancing going on with the drops.

31:14.112 --> 31:18.816
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you wanted to, you could also play in your arcade-perfect-nothing-has-been-changed mode.

31:19.409 --> 31:19.589
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, um,

31:47.760 --> 31:58.923
[SPEAKER_04]: One other thing that I think is very, very, very cool, and I'm very, very, very excited about this, is that Bionic Commando is getting a remake.

31:59.644 --> 32:01.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yeah, it's about fucking time.

32:01.244 --> 32:02.004
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yes.

32:02.504 --> 32:04.465
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if you still get to kill Hitler in it.

32:05.558 --> 32:08.521
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but it still looks awesome if you've seen the video for it.

32:08.861 --> 32:12.485
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only seen the little preview that showed the screenshots.

32:12.525 --> 32:13.646
[SPEAKER_08]: I've not seen the game in motion.

32:13.666 --> 32:15.007
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the video is all here.

32:15.087 --> 32:18.190
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was a little nervous about the 3D looking.

32:18.811 --> 32:25.998
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean... Well, at any rate, it's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

32:26.338 --> 32:28.720
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm noticing that we're getting a lot more...

32:29.802 --> 32:33.906
[SPEAKER_04]: What would have been usually a console or only game on the PC now?

32:34.346 --> 32:36.588
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot more love for PC gamers.

32:36.668 --> 32:37.148
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

32:37.229 --> 32:38.690
[SPEAKER_04]: No one plays games on the PC anymore.

32:39.070 --> 32:40.051
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

32:40.111 --> 32:40.772
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody.

32:41.012 --> 32:43.194
[SPEAKER_08]: You know you just got yelled at by several people in chat.

32:43.214 --> 32:44.435
[SPEAKER_06]: I beat sarcastic people.

32:44.535 --> 32:44.935
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.

32:44.995 --> 32:45.576
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

32:46.416 --> 32:47.437
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you that dumb?

32:47.497 --> 32:49.359
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course people play games on a PC.

32:49.459 --> 32:50.720
[SPEAKER_04]: How many million people play WoW?

32:50.740 --> 33:01.269
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be that we'd mainly get our first person shooters on PC, but now we're seeing more and more of them on consoles, and we're seeing more and more platformers come out for PC.

33:02.090 --> 33:06.694
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like the whole gaming community is now sort of banding together.

33:06.774 --> 33:10.017
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, remember folks, the PlayStation 3 is a computer, remember?

33:10.317 --> 33:11.038
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

33:12.458 --> 33:16.001
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but according to the marketing, that's a little more accurate.

33:16.302 --> 33:16.742
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

33:16.802 --> 33:17.263
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

33:17.303 --> 33:17.723
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.

33:17.783 --> 33:18.224
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

33:18.324 --> 33:22.107
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at any rate, Capcom is working with Grin.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.692
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter PC.

33:27.853 --> 33:34.940
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also, they have not announced a Wii release.

33:35.641 --> 33:36.621
[SPEAKER_08]: And Tigerclaw on our chat.

33:36.642 --> 33:37.102
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a release date.

33:37.591 --> 33:41.852
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Tigerclaw in our chatroom has something to say about the lack of a Wii Bionic Commando.

33:42.272 --> 33:43.672
[SPEAKER_08]: Surprisingly, no Wii version.

33:44.013 --> 33:48.814
[SPEAKER_08]: The game looks like something perfect for the Wiimote, and it's surprising that they're not making it for it.

33:49.134 --> 33:53.715
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo could have cashed in on it by re-releasing the original NES version on the Virtual Console.

33:54.095 --> 33:58.776
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they'll probably still try to cash in on it anyways, but here's the problem, though, with the Wii.

33:59.296 --> 34:00.737
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't handle the game.

34:01.098 --> 34:05.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because it has the little waggle controls and stuff that would be perfect for this.

34:05.581 --> 34:07.663
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, Nintendo decided, hey, you know what?

34:08.043 --> 34:10.726
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really care about graphics, so sorry.

34:11.286 --> 34:11.927
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't make that.

34:12.247 --> 34:15.469
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if they had ported it to the PlayStation 2, yeah, we could port that pretty easy.

34:15.509 --> 34:16.330
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but wait a minute, though.

34:16.450 --> 34:22.275
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, that was Capcom's decision to say, we're going to go for, you know, the highest quality.

34:22.657 --> 34:29.638
[SPEAKER_08]: quality in looks and, you know, sound department as opposed to incorporating the wiggle waggles.

34:29.778 --> 34:40.361
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to understand that people on the PlayStation 3 and 360 love action games, you know, much like, you know, Dead Rising, Lost Planet, you know, the new Bionic Commando game and stuff like that.

34:41.601 --> 34:46.762
[SPEAKER_06]: We gamers only like Zack and Wiki, Quest for Rose Treasure.

34:47.202 --> 34:48.602
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing that they can have.

34:48.622 --> 34:50.543
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, that's my favorite fucking game right there.

34:51.283 --> 34:52.023
[SPEAKER_06]: That and Resident Evil 4.

34:52.637 --> 34:54.018
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little mix up there, but yeah.

34:55.478 --> 35:02.041
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that Capcom could do something if they were willing to, you know, focus on gameplay more.

35:03.621 --> 35:08.263
[SPEAKER_04]: Then again, one of the things I've always enjoyed about many Capcom games is that they do tend to have really good gameplay.

35:09.344 --> 35:10.844
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that, make me some more Mega Man Legends.

35:10.904 --> 35:11.565
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go on the Wii.

35:11.725 --> 35:12.005
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

35:12.025 --> 35:12.405
[SPEAKER_06]: Done.

35:12.465 --> 35:12.645
[SPEAKER_06]: Done.

35:13.555 --> 35:14.815
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a series that needs to die.

35:15.235 --> 35:18.236
[SPEAKER_08]: NM64 wants to remind you also on the Wii, minigames.

35:18.756 --> 35:19.256
[SPEAKER_08]: My mistake.

35:19.276 --> 35:19.876
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of minigames.

35:20.256 --> 35:21.437
[SPEAKER_08]: Bionic Commando minigames.

35:21.497 --> 35:22.617
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, look, pop the bubbles.

35:23.657 --> 35:24.957
[SPEAKER_08]: Kill Hitler again and again.

35:27.618 --> 35:28.678
[SPEAKER_08]: Wii.

35:29.238 --> 35:29.658
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

35:31.099 --> 35:34.499
[SPEAKER_08]: Dafo in the chat room would like to say, Zack and Wiki looks awesome.

35:34.539 --> 35:35.620
[SPEAKER_08]: How dare that be bashed?

35:36.220 --> 35:38.800
[SPEAKER_08]: How dare you, Loki, on this program?

35:39.100 --> 35:42.001
[SPEAKER_04]: On this show, there's not much that we don't dare to do.

35:43.143 --> 35:43.883
[SPEAKER_04]: at different times.

35:44.044 --> 35:49.427
[SPEAKER_08]: Son of Dad would like to remind us all that Okami's being ported to the Wii and not to next-gen with sharp graphics.

35:49.827 --> 35:55.170
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Wii is getting kind of something that... I think it's been proven that the Wii can handle cell shading fairly well.

35:55.230 --> 35:56.811
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't Okami cell shaded?

35:56.891 --> 36:00.313
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just awfully surprised that Wii's getting yet another PlayStation 2 port.

36:00.353 --> 36:01.774
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, that's surprising.

36:02.214 --> 36:07.997
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, with Resident Evil 4 and all those other fucking games that PlayStation 2, Xbox 360 port, or Xbox ports...

36:10.069 --> 36:15.194
[SPEAKER_08]: Ryoma says, if you're going to do the Bionic Commando minigames, pick Hitler's nose.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.997
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that one game in WarioWare.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.460
[SPEAKER_06]: This just in on the Smash Dojo.

36:22.540 --> 36:23.741
[SPEAKER_06]: Hitler, the new character.

36:25.683 --> 36:26.844
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that one.

36:29.086 --> 36:31.048
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

36:31.994 --> 36:40.137
[SPEAKER_04]: and M64 reminds you very subtly, but not really, that RE4 was a GameCube port, not a PS2 port.

36:41.778 --> 36:46.960
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe it was a PlayStation 2 port for this one because it had the upgraded graphics from the PlayStation 2 and the additional features.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.860
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it was on the GameCube too.

36:49.000 --> 36:55.023
[SPEAKER_06]: So they could have hybrid, you know, some bastard child of the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions.

36:55.043 --> 36:57.343
[SPEAKER_08]: So what you're basically trying to say is I'm right and you're wrong.

36:58.424 --> 37:01.185
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's exact... Thank you for...

37:01.815 --> 37:02.776
[SPEAKER_06]: Nailing home my point there.

37:03.196 --> 37:04.577
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome, that's what I do here.

37:05.058 --> 37:12.024
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, since these games won't be out until next year at the earliest, let's talk about some stuff you can get right now, this week.

37:12.584 --> 37:16.027
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, and there's going to be lots of fun stuff coming out this week.

37:17.188 --> 37:27.217
[SPEAKER_06]: Some stuff, I don't know, people, why you want them or not, but of the many things, the ever-controversial...

37:28.175 --> 37:31.020
[SPEAKER_06]: Eye of Judgment is coming out this week on PlayStation 3.

37:31.380 --> 37:36.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you'll be able to play your Magic the Gathering type of crap with the eye.

37:37.145 --> 37:38.206
[SPEAKER_06]: The PlayStation Eye.

37:38.426 --> 37:47.191
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember, folks, if one million copies of this game sell, Loki will dress up in a Tingle outfit and set an eye of judgment on fire for your viewing pleasure.

37:47.231 --> 37:48.252
[SPEAKER_04]: He should dance around it.

37:48.712 --> 37:51.234
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you should do this anyway, because it would be so funny.

37:51.254 --> 37:52.214
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to do that.

37:52.495 --> 37:53.015
[SPEAKER_04]: You can burn it.

37:53.035 --> 37:54.416
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop trying to cop out.

37:54.776 --> 38:00.980
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, if it doesn't sell a million, though, while we will not require you to dress as Tingle, you need to at least wear the hat and burn it.

38:02.000 --> 38:02.481
[SPEAKER_08]: What hat?

38:03.201 --> 38:10.205
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we negotiate that maybe if they can sell 50,000 units, you'll just wear the little green hat and set it on fire?

38:10.225 --> 38:11.386
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not doing that.

38:12.667 --> 38:13.387
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all or nothing.

38:14.568 --> 38:14.948
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.

38:15.689 --> 38:17.050
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you at least set one on fire?

38:18.130 --> 38:20.672
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, if someone sends me one for free, I'll set one on fire.

38:20.692 --> 38:21.652
[SPEAKER_06]: We should dance around it.

38:22.773 --> 38:24.374
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to buy one to set one on fire.

38:24.414 --> 38:25.355
[SPEAKER_06]: That's stupid.

38:25.455 --> 38:27.716
[SPEAKER_08]: If we all put in 20 bucks, we could buy one to set on fire.

38:27.776 --> 38:28.056
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

38:28.436 --> 38:28.797
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

38:29.497 --> 38:30.598
[SPEAKER_08]: BurnMyEyeOfJudgment.com

38:32.725 --> 38:36.186
[SPEAKER_06]: Ace Combat 6 is coming out on Xbox 360.

38:36.567 --> 38:39.808
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty interesting.

38:40.248 --> 38:41.029
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's a good game.

38:41.909 --> 38:44.830
[SPEAKER_06]: Clive Barker's Jericho is coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

38:45.130 --> 38:47.311
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a horror first-person shooter game.

38:48.352 --> 38:52.873
[SPEAKER_06]: Conan, also coming out in both systems as well, and as I reviewed it, it's pretty good.

38:53.154 --> 38:54.794
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely worth checking it out.

38:56.775 --> 38:58.696
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, King of Fighters 11 on PlayStation 2.

39:00.189 --> 39:02.690
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a really budget game, too.

39:02.710 --> 39:03.870
[SPEAKER_06]: $14.99, if I remember correctly.

39:04.311 --> 39:07.812
[SPEAKER_06]: Dancing with the Stars on the Wii and PlayStation 2.

39:08.152 --> 39:08.732
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

39:08.752 --> 39:09.112
[SPEAKER_08]: Yippee.

39:09.132 --> 39:10.253
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds fun.

39:10.313 --> 39:11.673
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's only on the Wii this week.

39:11.713 --> 39:12.814
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 2 is coming out later.

39:13.444 --> 39:14.345
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:36.585 --> 39:38.126
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not buying it, but, you know, hey.

39:38.606 --> 39:41.507
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it would be a good idea if they used the X-Tango engine.

39:41.567 --> 39:42.868
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be cool to rent it.

39:43.248 --> 39:44.648
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's the X-Tango engine.

39:44.708 --> 39:46.329
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, am I in Bizarro World?

39:46.369 --> 39:49.170
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you guys actually hyping the Dancing with the Stars video game?

39:49.250 --> 39:49.850
[SPEAKER_04]: I would play it.

39:49.890 --> 39:51.371
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like 20 bucks, okay?

39:51.991 --> 39:53.152
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Dancing with the Stars.

39:53.432 --> 39:54.492
[SPEAKER_08]: I like X-Tango.

39:54.532 --> 39:55.332
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I'll give you that.

39:55.693 --> 39:58.534
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, I'm not seeing this game as X-Tango, okay?

39:58.974 --> 39:59.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Because...

39:59.881 --> 40:02.543
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to dirty the Xtango name with this game.

40:02.643 --> 40:03.143
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, my bad.

40:03.223 --> 40:04.444
[SPEAKER_06]: Apologies to the folks behind Xtango.

40:04.684 --> 40:07.025
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I do like Dancing with the Stars, Rob.

40:07.945 --> 40:08.206
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

40:08.246 --> 40:09.446
[SPEAKER_08]: But you don't watch TV, I thought.

40:09.866 --> 40:11.727
[SPEAKER_04]: I watch the dances on YouTube.

40:12.508 --> 40:12.568
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

40:12.608 --> 40:15.710
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was all about the Stacey Keebler series.

40:16.550 --> 40:17.771
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

40:17.811 --> 40:20.092
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3 is getting quite a few games here.

40:20.132 --> 40:21.353
[SPEAKER_06]: Juice 2, Hot Import Nights.

40:21.373 --> 40:22.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're finally getting that now.

40:22.893 --> 40:24.794
[SPEAKER_06]: Ratchet & Clank Future, Tools of Destruction.

40:25.155 --> 40:26.075
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be pretty awesome.

40:26.575 --> 40:29.217
[SPEAKER_06]: Ratatouille, that's coming out.

40:29.944 --> 40:31.925
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's see here.

40:44.130 --> 40:44.790
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare you.

40:45.330 --> 40:50.392
[SPEAKER_06]: Namco Museum Remix, hooray, that's also coming out on the Wii.

40:50.613 --> 40:51.473

[SPEAKER_08]: Spanish for Everyone?

41:25.820 --> 41:26.621
[SPEAKER_06]: Spanish for Everyone.

41:27.742 --> 41:30.105
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you do in Spanish for Everyone?

41:30.565 --> 41:31.586
[SPEAKER_06]: You learn Spanish.

41:32.527 --> 41:33.789
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I want?

41:55.948 --> 41:57.109
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Imagine Sniper.

41:58.470 --> 41:58.710
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

41:59.651 --> 42:03.834
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, you know, snipers, not that popular with little girls.

42:04.175 --> 42:05.476
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to be a sniper when I was growing up.

42:05.496 --> 42:07.798
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it does become popular, they will have Imagine Snipers.

42:08.198 --> 42:09.579
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, they don't right now.

42:12.197 --> 42:21.642
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine, or, I'm sorry, Pocket Pets, which is yet another pet-raising sim, and apparently, judging by the cover, it features bunnies, kittens, and little birdies.

42:22.463 --> 42:23.123
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

42:24.984 --> 42:26.325
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the hippopotamuses?

42:26.765 --> 42:27.405
[SPEAKER_06]: Or hippopotami?

42:27.425 --> 42:29.146
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw says Imagine OLR, by the way.

42:31.261 --> 42:36.604
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was going to say also Naruto Clash of the Ninja Revolution on Wii.

42:37.544 --> 42:41.306
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally just a small little game, of course, on almost everything.

42:41.366 --> 42:45.427
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, Wii, and maybe the PC this week.

42:46.248 --> 42:50.170
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually a week from now, Guitar Hero 3 will be making its way out.

42:52.130 --> 42:52.531
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

42:52.671 --> 42:53.271
[SPEAKER_06]: On a Sunday.

42:53.291 --> 42:54.652
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, is that out this Tuesday?

42:54.872 --> 42:55.932
[SPEAKER_06]: It's out on next Sunday.

42:55.952 --> 42:56.753
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's on Sunday.

42:57.053 --> 42:57.333
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 28th.

42:58.547 --> 43:01.449
[SPEAKER_06]: because they have to be so cool Sunday.

43:02.689 --> 43:06.091
[SPEAKER_08]: This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Guitar Hero 3 for everybody.

43:06.432 --> 43:07.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

43:07.072 --> 43:09.914
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, I'm looking real quick on the PC stuff.

43:11.635 --> 43:14.917
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there are some interesting PC games I was going to mention real quick.

43:16.378 --> 43:22.201
[SPEAKER_06]: Dream Day Honeymoon, which I have no idea what that is, but I want to take a look here real quick.

43:22.581 --> 43:23.922
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to go on a Dream Day Honeymoon?

43:24.335 --> 43:25.156
[SPEAKER_06]: Dream Day Honeymoon.

43:25.276 --> 43:28.638
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, there's no information for that whatsoever, but that is available if you're curious.

43:30.039 --> 43:32.942
[SPEAKER_06]: And some Agatha Christie game.

43:34.343 --> 43:34.643
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

43:35.544 --> 43:35.844
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

43:36.244 --> 43:40.527
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's travel over to Japan and see what our friends overseas in Japan are picking up this week.

43:41.488 --> 43:44.831
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get on the Xbox 360, Bladestorm.

43:44.911 --> 43:47.573
[SPEAKER_08]: The Hundred Years War is coming out on the Xbox 360.

43:47.973 --> 43:51.776
[SPEAKER_08]: That's from Koei, who I believe brought you Dynasty Wars.

43:51.816 --> 43:51.896
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

43:53.348 --> 43:54.910
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I forgot to mention, U.S.

43:55.510 --> 43:57.072
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomb Raider Anniversary on the 360th.

43:57.772 --> 43:58.433
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my turn now.

43:59.114 --> 43:59.494
[SPEAKER_07]: My turn.

43:59.634 --> 44:01.876
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

44:01.936 --> 44:03.678
[SPEAKER_08]: Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party!

44:04.319 --> 44:12.687
[SPEAKER_08]: Yubamani fans over in Japan get a chance now with the Wii version of DDR, the latest title, finally hitting Japanese shelves this week.

44:13.127 --> 44:13.368
[SPEAKER_08]: That's...

44:14.498 --> 44:16.899
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually, I remember back in the day, it used to be the other way around.

44:16.939 --> 44:21.801
[SPEAKER_08]: Japan would get these games like years before we would get them, and now it seems like we get a few of these first.

44:22.141 --> 44:23.582
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the same thing happened with Supernova 2.

44:23.922 --> 44:24.382
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

44:25.422 --> 44:30.665
[SPEAKER_08]: Also on the Nintendo Wii, Ghost Squad is coming out from Sega in Japan.

44:31.165 --> 44:34.586
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming out on the Wii, the simple Wii series.

44:34.666 --> 44:42.189
[SPEAKER_08]: There's Volume 1, the Mina de Kart Race, and there's Volume 2, the Mina de Basuri Takai is coming out.

44:42.689 --> 44:44.030
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm assuming that's like

44:44.887 --> 44:46.728
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a Mario Kart game.

45:09.133 --> 45:10.434
[SPEAKER_06]: The Eye of Judgment God of War 2 The End Begins

45:37.783 --> 45:43.370
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Itsuka Todoku Ano Sora Ni is coming out.

45:43.430 --> 45:50.238
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an adventure game that looks to be based on yet another anime starring cute little girls in schoolgirl outfits.

45:51.199 --> 45:55.824
[SPEAKER_08]: Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, Baldur Bullet Equilibrium coming from Alchemist.

45:56.284 --> 45:58.447
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like another mech warrior type game.

45:59.793 --> 46:00.894
[SPEAKER_08]: Dungeon Maker Final Fantasy Tactics A2

46:23.240 --> 46:24.101

[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for Japanese releases.

[SPEAKER_04]: Coded Arms Contagion, Escape from Paradise City on PSP, Escape from Paradise City on PC, Jackass the Game on PSP, Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, King of Clubs, Metroid Prime 3, Corruption on Wii, NBA 2K8, NBA Live 08, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Portal on PlayStation 3, Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on a bunch of stuff, Stranglehold, Syphon Filter, Dark Mirror,

47:58.755 --> 47:59.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, awesome.

48:00.717 --> 48:13.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in un-gaming release news, apparently this week they've been having some interesting guests on the morning show here in the US, and

48:14.517 --> 48:14.857
[SPEAKER_08]: Susan Bartel

48:41.053 --> 48:48.357
[SPEAKER_06]: Supergirl in the show says, when kids play violent video games, we can see that their brains are different than when they play non-violent games.

48:49.017 --> 48:55.341
[SPEAKER_06]: Going on to say, we can see a very big difference in their brains, which tells us how dangerous these games can be.

48:57.882 --> 49:06.627
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know... Just an FYI, according to Wikipedia, the morning show with Mike and Juliet is mostly on Fox and My Network TV stations.

49:06.687 --> 49:07.267
[SPEAKER_08]: It's syndicated.

49:08.688 --> 49:09.288
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

49:10.229 --> 49:10.309
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

49:11.221 --> 49:24.291
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, they're saying that, I guess she wrapped the whole segment up by saying they're going to react in the same highly aroused, angry way that we saw what happened yesterday.

49:24.331 --> 49:30.156
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, they were talking about a school shooting that happened in Cleveland that she was referencing back to that.

49:30.456 --> 49:38.342
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the interesting thing about that, though, you see, because Game Politics actually went and asked her about that.

49:38.763 --> 49:40.444
[SPEAKER_06]: because they had some issues with it.

49:40.584 --> 49:52.154
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that they found, I guess, concerning, I guess, was a comment when they saw the Indiana University brain scan pic five minutes before the airing of the show.

49:52.654 --> 50:04.704
[SPEAKER_06]: So she had looked at, basically, the brain scan image literally minutes before the show started, and they were saying, well, how can you base your professional opinion on just a brief glance at it?

50:05.364 --> 50:07.246
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was saying, well, it's, you know...

50:08.836 --> 50:14.259
[SPEAKER_06]: Not concrete proof, but that doesn't change anything.

50:15.580 --> 50:20.462
[SPEAKER_06]: She's saying that maybe it's a little bit sensationalized because it's on TV and stuff.

50:20.682 --> 50:22.083
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, I understand how you feel.

50:22.123 --> 50:24.644
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an element of sensationalism to it, I suppose.

50:25.224 --> 50:29.567
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't, five minutes before going on air, say, sorry, I won't do it.

50:30.507 --> 50:33.329
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have enough background information about this brain scan.

50:33.389 --> 50:35.610
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that much of a purist.

50:35.650 --> 50:37.931
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, she's talking out of her ass.

50:39.039 --> 50:39.379
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

50:39.920 --> 51:04.220
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to follow up with the whole thing, Game Politics also ran another story about, I guess it was being reported in Scientific America, Richard Tremblay, a professor of pediatrics, psychiatry, and psychology, said that kids were aggressive before modern media came along, so we can't blame modern media for kids being aggressive.

51:04.240 --> 51:06.983
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then again, wasn't there the study on how...

51:08.152 --> 51:09.353
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51:37.560 --> 51:40.924
[SPEAKER_08]: Blaze says, couldn't various games cause the same brain scan read?

51:41.945 --> 51:45.150
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkShy wants to know, why are all school shootings blamed on video games?

51:46.161 --> 51:58.386
[SPEAKER_08]: and GS68 is wondering, since we call Tack Johnson, because we don't want to call him by name and he's effectively banned from the show, since we call him Lord Voldemort, just in case you're first time listening and you wonder, who the hell is Voldemort?

51:58.766 --> 52:02.267
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that guy, that lawyer guy that needs to STFU.

52:03.168 --> 52:07.329
[SPEAKER_08]: GS68 is wondering, should we call this lady Bellatrix Lestrange?

52:09.250 --> 52:11.451
[SPEAKER_01]: She had an unhealthy obsession with...

52:12.190 --> 52:19.393
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, I don't think she's going to be randomly posting on different websites about shit, making threats, and acting purely crazy.

52:21.134 --> 52:26.136
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I don't think we really need to worry about calling her anything else, since obviously she's going to be out of the news.

52:27.456 --> 52:28.517
[SPEAKER_04]: We should call her Loser.

52:28.937 --> 52:33.819
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, I agree with what Shadow Charlie said, and honestly, I think this just pretty much sums up our feedback.

52:33.859 --> 52:36.640
[SPEAKER_08]: Shadow Charlie in our chatroom says, she can shut the fuck up.

52:38.303 --> 52:39.124
[SPEAKER_08]: She really can.

52:39.645 --> 52:45.431
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, people like this just get our anger going and our blood boiling.

52:46.372 --> 52:56.083
[SPEAKER_08]: You knew when you read this story on Game Politics or wherever you might have seen it earlier this week, you knew that on this program, this segment would be following a story about this stupid, stupid woman.

52:56.544 --> 52:57.465
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the FUs of the Week.

53:13.636 --> 53:19.438
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes towards certain things at my place of employment.

53:21.198 --> 53:34.843
[SPEAKER_04]: Without getting into too much detail about what I do for a living, I work a job that they assign tasks to me that I'm supposed to have done within a certain number of days, right?

53:35.723 --> 53:38.384
[SPEAKER_04]: And on average, I do about 70 to 80 a day.

53:39.144 --> 53:41.885
[SPEAKER_04]: So I come in one day and there's 600 and something of them.

53:42.924 --> 53:45.626
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I closed 110 that day.

53:46.947 --> 53:48.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a lot more than I usually do.

53:49.108 --> 53:51.550
[SPEAKER_04]: I came back the next day, there were 704.

53:52.711 --> 53:53.831
[SPEAKER_04]: I closed 90 that day.

53:54.011 --> 53:55.653
[SPEAKER_04]: I came back in, there were 780.

53:58.154 --> 53:59.335
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

53:59.995 --> 54:09.902
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I have a right to complain about this because, um, if I don't finish enough of it within my turnaround time, then it comes back and I get dinged for it.

54:10.503 --> 54:11.083
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um,

54:11.937 --> 54:20.001
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be surprised when certain things happen, is all I'm going to say.

54:20.541 --> 54:24.684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, and every time I try to apply for another position at work, I'm written up for something.

54:25.584 --> 54:26.004
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

54:27.965 --> 54:29.326
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki, let loose.

54:29.466 --> 54:30.066
[SPEAKER_08]: F yous of the week.

54:30.547 --> 54:40.912
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you to Kanye West for ruining Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger by the Daft Punk and trying to claim, I guess, make his own song by sampling that entire thing.

54:42.375 --> 54:44.316
[SPEAKER_06]: He's awful as an artist to begin with.

54:44.616 --> 54:46.318
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also watched Saturday Night Live.

54:46.458 --> 54:49.920
[SPEAKER_06]: They had another song that he did where he sampled Pretty Young Thing from Michael Jackson.

54:50.240 --> 54:53.222
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, an unoriginal bastard who needs to fucking die.

54:53.542 --> 54:55.043
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he has no talent.

54:55.423 --> 54:57.445
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hate people that fucking sample shit.

54:59.006 --> 55:00.487
[SPEAKER_06]: Also looking at you, Black Eyed Peas.

55:00.567 --> 55:01.547
[SPEAKER_06]: You fucking suck too.

55:01.647 --> 55:03.108
[SPEAKER_06]: So, F you to both of them.

55:05.890 --> 55:09.072
[SPEAKER_08]: My F you of the week goes to Children That Go To Disneyland.

55:09.650 --> 55:10.491
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get back into some news.

55:40.472 --> 55:43.074
[SPEAKER_08]: Game Boy and Game Boy Pocket Rarity and Scarcity of Repair Parts

56:05.274 --> 56:08.015
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, when I first read this, I was actually surprised.

56:08.315 --> 56:10.755
[SPEAKER_08]: They've still been repairing Famicoms this long?

56:11.635 --> 56:11.875
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

56:12.055 --> 56:15.156
[SPEAKER_08]: But apparently they were, and unfortunately now it is over.

56:15.536 --> 56:19.077
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this is just Nintendo of Japan, but still, you know.

56:19.337 --> 56:22.317
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, seriously, if you have a broken Nintendo, don't go out and buy something else.

56:22.457 --> 56:25.518
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, why are you still playing Nintendo?

56:25.538 --> 56:26.938
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad news for retro collectors, though.

56:26.978 --> 56:27.198
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

56:27.678 --> 56:31.299
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder, though, if, well, you know, that means that the prices of these systems are going to go up.

56:32.025 --> 56:42.768
[SPEAKER_04]: because to use pinball as a comparison, for machines that start seeing revivals when you can start getting parts for them again, the price of the tables goes down.

56:43.268 --> 56:49.990
[SPEAKER_04]: But when they stop making the replacement plastics and stuff for some of the other tables, the value jumps up by at least $5,000.

56:50.230 --> 56:58.912
[SPEAKER_06]: To be honest, a lot of people that are collecting these retro systems anyways probably know how to fix them, or if they don't know how to fix them, know of somebody who can fix them.

56:59.352 --> 57:00.713
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there are other websites other than...

57:01.953 --> 57:04.775
[SPEAKER_06]: or there are other people out there that know how to fix these systems.

57:04.855 --> 57:06.136
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just Nintendo.

57:06.496 --> 57:07.177
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a thought.

57:07.297 --> 57:09.538
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet this is why they're ending the support now.

57:10.139 --> 57:20.686
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would they want to encourage people to buy the games at garage sales and stuff on these old systems when they have this brand spanking new virtual console that's delivering all the games from these old consoles?

57:20.766 --> 57:22.267
[SPEAKER_08]: This is why they're ending support now.

57:23.387 --> 57:24.928
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bet you.

57:25.529 --> 57:27.410
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just because of what they actually said.

57:27.670 --> 57:28.771
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think I'm right and you're wrong.

57:29.301 --> 57:30.562
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, Game Boy Color.

57:30.582 --> 57:34.504
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't see any Game Boy Color stuff on fucking... Yet.

57:35.265 --> 57:36.125
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on.

57:36.145 --> 57:37.586
[SPEAKER_06]: It would look like shit.

57:38.167 --> 57:39.408
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my theory behind it.

57:40.849 --> 57:49.774
[SPEAKER_04]: Why waste manpower on something the company itself has decided was obsolete when they can focus towards their current thing?

57:50.815 --> 57:53.837
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of like paying somebody to fix a Betamax.

57:55.058 --> 57:55.318
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?

57:56.556 --> 57:57.637
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of buy that.

57:57.697 --> 57:58.657
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense to me.

57:58.697 --> 58:01.880
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, why didn't they do that 10 years ago with the Famicom?

58:02.881 --> 58:04.603
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Famicom has been out like 20 years.

58:05.143 --> 58:10.609
[SPEAKER_04]: But 10 years ago, I think that they still had a big enough user base because 10 years ago, what was it that we were seeing out?

58:10.649 --> 58:12.050
[SPEAKER_04]: I was still playing my Super Nintendo.

58:12.350 --> 58:14.112
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the N64 had just been out.

58:15.199 --> 58:17.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the Famicom is still probably outselling the PlayStation 3.

58:17.441 --> 58:25.008
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, the only way you could get any of your retro games is to either own the old system or to play on emulators.

58:25.548 --> 58:33.555
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we have it to where all these games are being re-released on, you know, we have Virtual Console, we have Xbox Live Arcade.

58:34.136 --> 58:37.038
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're looking at it as progress.

58:37.559 --> 58:42.223
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the point now when they can get the same thing on one of our more up-to-date systems?

58:43.146 --> 58:45.868
[SPEAKER_04]: So why should they waste the support, manpower, and product?

58:45.968 --> 58:53.014
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if they make some systems actually put on the market, you know, so we can buy them to replace our broken Famicom.

58:53.034 --> 58:53.875
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe that's why.

58:53.895 --> 58:54.435
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay.

58:54.495 --> 58:56.357
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, maybe that's why they've got to pull the old support.

58:56.397 --> 58:57.718
[SPEAKER_08]: Get some people on the assembly line.

58:57.918 --> 59:08.146
[SPEAKER_04]: And to go back to my, I guess, analogy to the Betamax, you know, you can't get Sony to replace your Betamax machine, but you can go to specialty repair shops and they'll do it.

59:08.446 --> 59:09.867
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be the same way with old systems.

59:11.549 --> 59:11.829
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

59:12.537 --> 59:13.398
[SPEAKER_08]: Virtual Console Stuff for the UK!

59:33.687 --> 59:39.628
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we are seeing out this time is World Heroes, which was a Neo Geo game.

59:40.188 --> 59:44.769
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really one of my favorite fighters, but it was pretty, pretty good, and it's 900 points.

59:45.750 --> 59:50.531
[SPEAKER_04]: And then coming up is Gate of Thunder from the TurboGrafx-16.

59:51.431 --> 01:00:02.053
[SPEAKER_04]: It was made by Hudson, and that was a pretty damn good game, where you have your ship called the Hunting Dog, and you are saving the starlight power.

01:00:03.228 --> 01:00:07.212
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's cool because the planet referred to as Planet Ares and I'm an Ares, so that's cool.

01:00:07.592 --> 01:00:08.213
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 800 points.

01:00:08.914 --> 01:00:17.302
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and then, and for anyone who watches the Angry Nintendo Nerd, you'll know where my frustration with this game comes from for exactly the same reason he did.

01:00:17.743 --> 01:00:22.047
[SPEAKER_04]: Castlevania II, Simon's Quest for the NES, where, you know...

01:00:22.984 --> 01:00:24.305
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:00:44.179 --> 01:00:46.181
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I haven't played a virtual console in a while.

01:00:46.221 --> 01:00:48.603
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a freaking awesome game, though.

01:00:48.623 --> 01:00:50.384
[SPEAKER_08]: Despite the frustration, I love the game.

01:00:50.424 --> 01:00:52.786
[SPEAKER_08]: And honestly, the music is half of what makes that game.

01:00:54.347 --> 01:00:55.848
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping it's over here on Monday.

01:00:56.729 --> 01:00:59.071
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see us get the Japanese version of Castlevania III.

01:01:01.013 --> 01:01:02.714
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the difference between that and this one?

01:01:02.754 --> 01:01:05.816
[SPEAKER_04]: It was certain gameplay factions that they took out.

01:01:05.876 --> 01:01:08.779
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, if you use the... Oh, God, I can't remember his name now.

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:09.679
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy who used the dagger?

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:10.600
[SPEAKER_06]: Grant?

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:11.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Grant, yes.

01:01:11.441 --> 01:01:11.541
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:01:12.172 --> 01:01:13.873
[SPEAKER_04]: In the Japanese version, he would throw the dagger.

01:01:14.914 --> 01:01:16.574
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it gave you ranged attack with him.

01:01:18.355 --> 01:01:20.276
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just one of the things I remember.

01:01:20.316 --> 01:01:22.337
[SPEAKER_08]: I always liked to use Alucard because he could turn into the bat.

01:01:24.538 --> 01:01:26.259
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Grant because he can climb on walls.

01:01:26.679 --> 01:01:27.100
[SPEAKER_08]: This is true.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.880
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was the guy that had the orbs, right?

01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:29.621
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even remember.

01:01:29.821 --> 01:01:30.881
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Saifa.

01:01:31.402 --> 01:01:31.682
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

01:01:32.202 --> 01:01:32.802
[SPEAKER_08]: That's old school.

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:33.223
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:01:33.983 --> 01:01:34.363
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:01:34.963 --> 01:01:35.564
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, that's 500 points.

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:42.354
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw would like to point out DarkSakura, also the fact that it had two different endings, and in one of them, Simon Belmont dies.

01:01:42.534 --> 01:01:43.795
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that was the other thing.

01:01:44.856 --> 01:01:47.357
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played the disc version of it.

01:01:48.198 --> 01:01:54.542
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, I've played a disc version of it, and the music was also a little bit different, but then again, the disc games had a different music processor.

01:01:54.562 --> 01:01:57.524
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, didn't they have an extra sound channel in Japan for that stuff?

01:01:58.065 --> 01:01:58.245
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:01:58.786 --> 01:02:03.889
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I remember one of my old roommates who was really into collecting games had the old, old Castlevania III.

01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:04.610
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I played it.

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:05.410
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was part of the reason.

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:06.831
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the first time I played it, though.

01:02:07.672 --> 01:02:10.994
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a disc one later on than that, but he brought it over to my house.

01:02:11.975 --> 01:02:12.115
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah.

01:02:12.615 --> 01:02:13.176
[SPEAKER_07]: I never played it.

01:02:13.576 --> 01:02:14.216
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:15.157
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:02:15.917 --> 01:02:25.404
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, soon enough, GameTap will be hitting 1,000 games, and they're supposed to hit this wonderful landmark achievement on November 15th.

01:02:27.089 --> 01:02:31.652
[SPEAKER_06]: Ice Station Santa Abe Lincoln Must Die Missed Uru Online's final episode in the Season 1 story arc will begin the 1st of November

01:02:56.279 --> 01:02:57.220
[SPEAKER_06]: and let's see here.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:08.066
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess now the first three Hitman games will be free to play for the non-subscribers as that part of kind of a free game sampling that they have there that's ad-supported.

01:03:08.987 --> 01:03:14.270
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess a new season of Revisioned, which before was looking at Lord Croft.

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:17.972
[SPEAKER_06]: They haven't said which character they're going to do this time or which series.

01:03:18.532 --> 01:03:21.254
[SPEAKER_06]: And then game trailers for various games.

01:03:23.295 --> 01:03:23.635
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:24.991
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like fun.

01:03:25.632 --> 01:03:31.276
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep neglecting to go back to GameTap and checking out some of those other new games that they have, like BlastMiner.

01:03:31.617 --> 01:03:38.222
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they're starting to put out the indie games, too, and I'm pretty sure BlastMiner finally made its way to GameTap, so I've got to check out some of the indie stuff they have on there.

01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:44.653
[SPEAKER_08]: I still wish though, they have Civilization 3 up in their archives, but they don't have Civ 1.

01:03:44.973 --> 01:03:56.457
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, for whatever reason, and I know I've gone into this tirade on the show before, so I'll keep it short tonight, but I prefer Civilization 1, the old school one, compared to any other Civ they've released since then.

01:03:56.997 --> 01:04:02.059
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Sid Meier, if you happen to be listening, please let them have Civilization on GameTap.

01:04:02.479 --> 01:04:04.720
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I would love you if you'd let them have Covert Action.

01:04:05.336 --> 01:04:09.304
[SPEAKER_08]: because that was like my favorite Sid Meier game ever and probably nobody's ever heard of it.

01:04:10.507 --> 01:04:12.852
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, speaking of...

01:04:14.045 --> 01:04:14.865
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

01:04:36.815 --> 01:04:37.676
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:05:07.346 --> 01:05:09.367
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking forward to getting more information on the game.

01:05:09.767 --> 01:05:16.750
[SPEAKER_08]: All we know so far is that there is a main character named the Little King, and he creates towns to basically build up a new country.

01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:23.112
[SPEAKER_08]: He uses special powers to make elemental skills, and basically this is all used to develop the land.

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:25.373
[SPEAKER_08]: So it almost sounds like it's some type of sim game.

01:05:25.894 --> 01:05:28.895
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like one half of Actraiser.

01:05:28.935 --> 01:05:30.615
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, no problem with that.

01:05:30.675 --> 01:05:31.876
[SPEAKER_08]: I freaking love Actraiser.

01:05:32.116 --> 01:05:32.416
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

01:05:32.436 --> 01:05:34.377
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I had a kid, I'd name him Little King.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.429
[SPEAKER_08]: Son of Dad says Wii needs a hard drive bad.

01:05:40.456 --> 01:05:46.500
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm also curious how the Wii is going to fit all this stuff in here, but I wouldn't be surprised.

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.241
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo's going to come out sometime next year.

01:05:48.261 --> 01:05:49.842
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the SD cards are for.

01:05:50.722 --> 01:05:58.207
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to come out at some point, and they're going to say, we have this super hidden expansion port thing, and we're bringing out this thing.

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:03.770
[SPEAKER_04]: If you invert your Wii, you'll find the port hidden somewhere on the system motherboard.

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:06.732
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there are expansion ports that aren't being used on there right now, right?

01:06:06.752 --> 01:06:07.112
[SPEAKER_08]: Or USB, right?

01:06:07.132 --> 01:06:07.232
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

01:06:08.574 --> 01:06:09.717
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got USB connections.

01:06:09.797 --> 01:06:10.760
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have USB.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:14.812
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, if you even wanted to get like crazy with it, you could have something that plugs into like

01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:18.282
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of irritated because they have all these hard drives that run on USB now, right?

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:20.222
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, I think I saw one at Target the other day.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.963
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, Jamie has one, but I've seen, now they even have new ones that are 500 gigabytes.

01:06:22.983 --> 01:06:23.443
[SPEAKER_06]: 500 gigabyte USB drive.

01:06:23.463 --> 01:06:23.843
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine's 500 gigabytes.

01:06:24.003 --> 01:06:24.324
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it really?

01:06:24.344 --> 01:06:25.264
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you said like a 300 something.

01:06:25.284 --> 01:06:25.864
[SPEAKER_08]: I paid $120 for it.

01:06:43.909 --> 01:06:44.609
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

01:06:44.629 --> 01:06:46.210
[SPEAKER_08]: 500 gigabytes for one of those things.

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:49.750
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't... It's USB, but I can't hook it up to my Wii.

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:51.331
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I can't hook it up to my 360.

01:06:52.051 --> 01:06:58.472
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't... I mean, because of... Because you know they're going to want you to use anything with their name on it so they can market it and make money on it.

01:06:58.492 --> 01:06:59.892
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just saying that sucks.

01:07:00.412 --> 01:07:05.013
[SPEAKER_08]: Because seriously, what else am I going to fill up the 500 gigabytes with besides lots of pornography?

01:07:05.033 --> 01:07:05.734
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to find a way.

01:07:05.754 --> 01:07:06.934
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots and lots of pornography.

01:07:06.954 --> 01:07:07.814
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to find a way.

01:07:07.834 --> 01:07:09.034
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:07:09.094 --> 01:07:12.835
[SPEAKER_06]: My USB hard drive fits quite a few Xbox 360 games quite easily.

01:07:14.205 --> 01:07:14.786
[SPEAKER_06]: In theory.

01:07:14.946 --> 01:07:16.026
[SPEAKER_08]: Next story, please.

01:07:16.787 --> 01:07:31.277
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, MadCatz has decided that they are going to give their support to the National Breast Cancer Foundation and release a pink tech pack for the DS Lite.

01:07:32.898 --> 01:07:42.785
[SPEAKER_04]: It will have accessories that have a carry case, a power adapter for your car, USB charge cable, two game cases, and two...

01:07:44.488 --> 01:07:45.769
[SPEAKER_04]: to the stylus pens.

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:47.130
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

01:07:48.591 --> 01:07:57.458
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's going to be a percentage from the purchase of this that's going to go toward, like I said, the National Breast Cancer Foundation and retail for $19.99.

01:07:59.807 --> 01:08:01.848
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, good for gaming and fundraising colliding.

01:08:01.888 --> 01:08:02.849
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good thing.

01:08:03.469 --> 01:08:11.294
[SPEAKER_08]: Going back to the previous story in our chat room, chat.org.com, Ranma's pointing out you can get a 1 terabyte, that's 1,000 gigabytes, drive for $399.

01:08:11.574 --> 01:08:16.057
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sephiroth1215 says, yeah, I know someone who has a 1 terabyte drive.

01:08:16.397 --> 01:08:18.498
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you put on that?

01:08:18.538 --> 01:08:20.419
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's a lot of porn.

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:21.700
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.501
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like weeks worth of porn.

01:08:23.641 --> 01:08:25.622
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was looking to buy was a terabyte.

01:08:25.662 --> 01:08:26.583
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell them at Fry's.

01:08:27.609 --> 01:08:28.870
[SPEAKER_08]: HD porn even.

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:32.573
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how much HD porn you could fit on a terabyte drive?

01:08:34.294 --> 01:08:34.995
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot.

01:08:35.035 --> 01:08:36.816
[SPEAKER_04]: The terabyte drives are something like $300 to $400.

01:08:38.177 --> 01:08:39.238
[SPEAKER_04]: But iOmega makes one.

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:41.720
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's 300 to 400 hours of porn.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:42.541
[SPEAKER_08]: That's amazing.

01:08:42.561 --> 01:08:46.304
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is, though, downloading that amount of porn would take lots of time.

01:08:47.084 --> 01:08:52.569
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the whole reason I bought mine was because, and now that it's happened, I saw it coming.

01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:56.672
[SPEAKER_04]: My PC was dying, so I bought my hard drive to save all my crap.

01:08:58.197 --> 01:09:01.519
[SPEAKER_08]: Zappy24 in chat says, a terabyte isn't as much as it seems.

01:09:01.599 --> 01:09:02.399
[SPEAKER_08]: It fills fast.

01:09:02.799 --> 01:09:04.760
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know who's been downloading the HD porn.

01:09:05.281 --> 01:09:06.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Just teasing.

01:09:06.321 --> 01:09:06.881
[SPEAKER_04]: Just teasing.

01:09:07.722 --> 01:09:18.027
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, what was taking up most of mine was I have entire seasons of Doctor Who and Stargate because, you know, I don't watch TV.

01:09:18.327 --> 01:09:22.529
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is borderline porn for you because every time you see... I have a fangasm.

01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:25.671
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, every time you see David Tennant, like, you get a

01:09:26.167 --> 01:09:27.748
[SPEAKER_08]: Femboner or whatever they're called.

01:09:29.009 --> 01:09:30.029
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, a fangasm.

01:09:31.570 --> 01:09:32.170
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a girlboner.

01:09:32.811 --> 01:09:33.371
[SPEAKER_08]: A girlboner.

01:09:34.392 --> 01:09:43.677
[SPEAKER_06]: So one thing that really shouldn't collide, but for some reason this year has been colliding more than I would like, would be baby-raising sims for the DS.

01:09:44.157 --> 01:09:55.403
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet another one has come along, Crave Entertainment's Baby Pals, which should be coming out in November if I remember correctly, is a baby-washing, dressing, and patty-caking sim.

01:09:56.308 --> 01:09:58.509
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically Nintendogs with babies.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:05.093
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to adopt a pet human, then feed it, bathe it, dress it in funny clothes.

01:10:05.573 --> 01:10:11.136
[SPEAKER_06]: You can even teach it to walk, talk, though if you do... Was that the first thing?

01:10:13.117 --> 01:10:14.838
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also from another article here.

01:10:15.238 --> 01:10:19.900
[SPEAKER_06]: Their comment was, if you get them to do these things, they're probably saying, why the hell am I wearing these funny clothes?

01:10:20.841 --> 01:10:20.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

01:10:22.069 --> 01:10:29.956
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing, though, they're asking in this article, which is kind of funny, is, so if you ignore your, you know, Nintendogs, you know, they run away and stuff.

01:10:30.556 --> 01:10:31.977
[SPEAKER_06]: Do the babies run away?

01:10:33.919 --> 01:10:35.981
[SPEAKER_06]: A baby's hitchhiking to Texas.

01:10:36.881 --> 01:10:41.145
[SPEAKER_06]: If you ignore your baby, does virtual social services rep come and take them away?

01:10:41.165 --> 01:10:41.325
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait!

01:10:43.408 --> 01:10:47.951
[SPEAKER_08]: If you ignore your baby, then Child Protective Services comes and takes your baby away?

01:10:48.032 --> 01:10:48.912
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was her joke.

01:10:48.932 --> 01:10:49.312
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh.

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:50.573
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's actually what's going to happen.

01:10:50.593 --> 01:10:51.154
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

01:10:51.234 --> 01:10:51.734
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I wish.

01:10:51.754 --> 01:10:53.995
[SPEAKER_04]: How would that be any different than the reality for some people?

01:10:54.015 --> 01:10:56.917
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, if you're Britney Spears, you might be able to benefit from this game.

01:10:56.937 --> 01:11:00.320
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the picture that they have on this Wired blog thing.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.221
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, Baby Spotted You.

01:11:03.888 --> 01:11:04.749
[SPEAKER_06]: It's creepy looking.

01:11:05.049 --> 01:11:08.971
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Baby Pals will be coming out for the DS in November.

01:11:09.312 --> 01:11:13.795
[SPEAKER_06]: In a big block of stuff that they have like all the pet series and sim raising shit.

01:11:14.075 --> 01:11:18.458
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's Imagine Babies and Baby Pals so far and I'm pretty sure there's going to be another one.

01:11:19.099 --> 01:11:23.720
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Loki, I know you've said you and the wife are thinking about having a baby in the not-too-distant future, right?

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.160
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you going to use this game as, like, a training?

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.881
[SPEAKER_06]: I should make her play this.

01:11:28.921 --> 01:11:30.381
[SPEAKER_08]: You should buy it for Nelly.

01:11:30.781 --> 01:11:34.402
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't know where you're at on that one and have a baby thing.

01:11:34.662 --> 01:11:42.263
[SPEAKER_08]: But if maybe you want to hold off a little bit, I say buy this game for Nelly and make sure that Child Protective Services doesn't take her Ninten baby away.

01:11:42.283 --> 01:11:43.363
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to buy this.

01:11:44.243 --> 01:11:48.264
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, this game poses the challenge of, like...

01:11:49.341 --> 01:11:49.942
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sims.

01:11:50.862 --> 01:11:56.388
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sims, you're supposed to make the family thrive and yada yada yada, but all I want to do in The Sims is try to kill them.

01:11:57.168 --> 01:12:03.274
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Baby Pals, you know, it's like, how can I possibly abuse these Sim babies?

01:12:03.394 --> 01:12:09.880
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just like in Nintendogs, you can kind of like, I don't know, throw the frisbee at their head and stuff.

01:12:11.702 --> 01:12:12.082
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be fun.

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:20.176
[SPEAKER_08]: Kiki just recently had a baby apparently and is saying, uh-huh, oh, she's born and sitting on my lap listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:20.516 --> 01:12:21.116
[SPEAKER_08]: Be careful.

01:12:21.176 --> 01:12:22.857
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be minus points for the baby.

01:12:25.039 --> 01:12:28.020
[SPEAKER_08]: That may be one step closer to CPS coming down.

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:28.721
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

01:12:29.181 --> 01:12:30.082
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, though.

01:12:30.122 --> 01:12:30.442
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

01:12:31.622 --> 01:12:32.523
[SPEAKER_08]: New babies are fun.

01:12:32.703 --> 01:12:34.904
[SPEAKER_08]: When they're real babies, they're good things.

01:12:35.064 --> 01:12:39.207
[SPEAKER_08]: When they're sim babies, they're stupid.

01:12:39.227 --> 01:12:41.048
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say I've met a good baby.

01:12:42.133 --> 01:12:45.815
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Becky, her baby, quiet, well-behaved.

01:12:47.475 --> 01:12:53.098
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Ryoma says the baby's going to ask, Mommy, what's a girl boner?

01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:56.599
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.820
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool, Deakman.

01:12:59.060 --> 01:12:59.961
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's Deakman.

01:13:00.041 --> 01:13:02.462
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, it's Deakman's partner.

01:13:02.522 --> 01:13:04.262
[SPEAKER_08]: Kiki's my girlfriend, and that's my baby.

01:13:04.903 --> 01:13:05.263
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

01:13:05.503 --> 01:13:07.504
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the whole family's listening to OLR together.

01:13:07.544 --> 01:13:09.284
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so... One, two, three.

01:13:09.624 --> 01:13:10.525
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

01:13:10.545 --> 01:13:10.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

01:13:12.924 --> 01:13:13.264
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

01:13:15.947 --> 01:13:17.868
[SPEAKER_08]: Message to the baby, stop crying so much.

01:13:18.589 --> 01:13:20.010
[SPEAKER_08]: Mommy and daddy value their sleep.

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:21.211
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

01:13:22.172 --> 01:13:23.893
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on with some news.

01:13:24.714 --> 01:13:28.057
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on to a completely different field here, MMOs.

01:13:28.544 --> 01:13:30.586
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people love their MMOs.

01:13:31.467 --> 01:13:34.189
[SPEAKER_08]: The World of Warcraft is still dominating as always.

01:13:34.249 --> 01:13:36.991
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's some other MMOs you may not have heard about.

01:13:37.892 --> 01:13:41.075
[SPEAKER_08]: RF Online is creating an MMO.

01:13:41.656 --> 01:13:45.399
[SPEAKER_08]: And the MMO is called... I'm sorry, RF Online is the game.

01:13:45.439 --> 01:13:48.221
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually being made by Codemasters.

01:13:49.202 --> 01:13:52.265
[SPEAKER_08]: RF Online is now a free game.

01:13:52.905 --> 01:13:54.707
[SPEAKER_08]: The game came out back in 2006.

01:13:56.121 --> 01:13:56.802
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:27.468
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to check this game out, it looks, I don't know, I look at the screenshot, it looks a little bit like Phantasy Star-ish to me, because it looks like it's the real-time fighting, but I couldn't tell you, because I haven't played the game myself yet, but now that it's free, I might just have the incentive to do that.

01:14:28.268 --> 01:14:29.068
[SPEAKER_08]: So, check that out.

01:14:29.128 --> 01:14:32.390
[SPEAKER_08]: It's rf-onlinegame.com if you want more information.

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:38.812
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have a little bit of information that will make lots and lots of people happy.

01:14:39.052 --> 01:14:39.833
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me happy.

01:14:40.673 --> 01:14:40.753
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

01:14:41.397 --> 01:14:42.758
[SPEAKER_04]: Night's has a date.

01:14:45.579 --> 01:14:49.980
[SPEAKER_04]: December 18th is going to be the release date for Night's Journey of Dreams.

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:58.463
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the UK, well, actually, it just says Europe in general, will be January is when the release is, though there's not a specific date.

01:15:00.984 --> 01:15:04.846
[SPEAKER_08]: So sorry, Night's fans, but no Christmas for you overseas.

01:15:05.186 --> 01:15:08.387
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you watch the demo play for Night's?

01:15:08.942 --> 01:15:10.743
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw some screens, but I didn't watch the demo.

01:15:10.983 --> 01:15:13.864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, very, very cool.

01:15:14.045 --> 01:15:16.226
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're a big fan of Nights.

01:15:16.446 --> 01:15:19.267
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you the one that told me Christmas Nights is one of your favorite games ever?

01:15:19.607 --> 01:15:22.349
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have a tradition in my house around Christmas.

01:15:22.389 --> 01:15:24.550
[SPEAKER_04]: We break out the Saturn, make sure the battery works.

01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:28.992
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I lost all of my Symphony of the Night data.

01:15:29.252 --> 01:15:29.972
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you were happy.

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:32.834
[SPEAKER_04]: After I maxed out everything you can with Maria.

01:15:33.094 --> 01:15:34.014
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you were very happy.

01:15:34.295 --> 01:15:34.655
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

01:15:35.195 --> 01:15:36.876
[SPEAKER_04]: But we play Christmas Nights every year.

01:15:38.349 --> 01:15:42.352
[SPEAKER_04]: We break out the Saturn in December and we play all the way through the dates.

01:15:42.932 --> 01:15:48.657
[SPEAKER_04]: The closer you get to Christmas, I think it's really cool that they change textures in it.

01:15:48.697 --> 01:15:49.657
[SPEAKER_04]: They change the music.

01:15:49.958 --> 01:15:50.898
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts snowing.

01:15:50.958 --> 01:15:53.420
[SPEAKER_04]: You get snow effects on the ground the closer you get to Christmas Day.

01:15:54.861 --> 01:15:55.962
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.

01:15:57.784 --> 01:15:59.445
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'll do something like that with this.

01:15:59.945 --> 01:16:00.786
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'll do that here.

01:16:01.146 --> 01:16:01.627
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

01:16:01.647 --> 01:16:01.787
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

01:16:03.516 --> 01:16:05.116
[SPEAKER_06]: Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas

01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:29.390
[SPEAKER_06]: on December 7th.

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:39.033
[SPEAKER_06]: Tickets go on sale on November 5th and are available on the Alamo Drafthouse's website or www.drafthouse.com.

01:16:40.293 --> 01:16:44.335
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in the area and want to go to the screen, be sure to pick up a ticket.

01:16:44.575 --> 01:16:56.018
[SPEAKER_06]: In attendance will be, let's see here, Fred Savage, Director Todd Holland, and let's see, Luke Edwards also will be there.

01:16:57.602 --> 01:17:04.767
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the Power Glove.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:07.629
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so bad.

01:17:10.311 --> 01:17:13.833
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, uh, just keep your Power Gloves off her, pal, huh?

01:17:15.995 --> 01:17:17.836
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is it that America loves the Wizard?

01:17:18.716 --> 01:17:19.417
[SPEAKER_03]: He grew up cute.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.340
[SPEAKER_08]: Fred Savage?

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, didn't you see... He still has the same face.

01:17:26.782 --> 01:17:30.744
[SPEAKER_08]: He had a sitcom on NBC a while ago, too.

01:17:34.545 --> 01:17:37.766
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it about The Wizard that people still love to this day?

01:17:38.927 --> 01:17:40.127
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just The Wizard.

01:17:40.871 --> 01:17:41.672
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know.

01:17:59.711 --> 01:18:02.392
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish they were doing this in more places than just Austin.

01:18:23.556 --> 01:18:30.081
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if they can do midnight showings of Showgirls, surely, surely they could put The Wizard in San Francisco for one night and people would come out.

01:18:30.101 --> 01:18:31.503
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you imagine having a shadow cast for The Wizard?

01:18:32.163 --> 01:18:33.204
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even want to think about it.

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:34.185
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

01:18:35.366 --> 01:18:37.047
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other movies I would rather see that done, too.

01:18:38.628 --> 01:18:43.272
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw says, people love The Wizard because it's filled with so much Nintendo propaganda.

01:18:43.953 --> 01:18:46.935
[SPEAKER_08]: Rama in chat says, The Wizard ranks right up there with UHF.

01:18:46.975 --> 01:18:47.896
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a cult classic.

01:18:48.877 --> 01:18:50.398
[SPEAKER_04]: UHF is what I was proposed to over.

01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:53.812
[SPEAKER_08]: Ramma said also, it's a cult classic.

01:18:54.212 --> 01:18:56.495
[SPEAKER_08]: It's when they revealed Super Mario Bros.

01:18:56.935 --> 01:18:56.495
3.

01:18:56.975 --> 01:18:59.077
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of us remember that from our childhood.

01:18:59.117 --> 01:19:01.900
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, a lot of us went to go see the movie just to freaking see Mario 3.

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:03.862
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the reasons, yeah, that I went and saw it.

01:19:03.882 --> 01:19:04.262
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too.

01:19:05.043 --> 01:19:05.323
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

01:19:06.084 --> 01:19:06.764
[SPEAKER_08]: That's hardcore.

01:19:06.804 --> 01:19:09.607
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm providing a shopping service for our listeners in the chat room.

01:19:09.787 --> 01:19:10.548
[SPEAKER_08]: What shopping service?

01:19:10.568 --> 01:19:11.108
[SPEAKER_08]: Shopping service?

01:19:11.349 --> 01:19:13.150
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, people saying, I want a Saturn.

01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:14.091
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, you want a Saturn?

01:19:14.111 --> 01:19:15.212
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy one off eBay.

01:19:15.232 --> 01:19:15.733
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some eBay...

01:19:16.836 --> 01:19:19.498
[SPEAKER_08]: Use your hard-earned money to buy something off eBay right now.

01:19:19.719 --> 01:19:20.719
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two Saturns.

01:19:20.739 --> 01:19:23.081
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want something bad enough, you'll make it happen.

01:19:23.121 --> 01:19:28.005
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a Saturn that I'm willing to get rid of because it has no controllers and no cords or anything.

01:19:28.045 --> 01:19:28.566
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take it.

01:19:28.646 --> 01:19:30.447
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a bajillion controllers and cords.

01:19:30.747 --> 01:19:30.967
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

01:19:30.987 --> 01:19:32.389
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be three Saturns in my house.

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:34.830
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a Saturn.

01:19:34.911 --> 01:19:37.433
[SPEAKER_08]: I've barely played any Saturn games in my life.

01:19:37.453 --> 01:19:39.034
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I need to play on a Saturn.

01:19:39.434 --> 01:19:40.115
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have that.

01:19:40.515 --> 01:19:41.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Stahl is awesome.

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:42.917
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to just borrow an extra set of...

01:19:43.615 --> 01:19:44.536
[SPEAKER_01]: controllers, of course.

01:19:44.716 --> 01:19:46.377
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have my first Saturn.

01:19:46.397 --> 01:19:47.597
[SPEAKER_06]: It has all the stuff for it.

01:19:48.038 --> 01:19:49.499
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't have the second one.

01:19:49.539 --> 01:19:58.184
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I went to Denio's, a local flea market over here, and the first one I saw was the Saturn without anything because the guy was selling it for like $20.

01:19:58.604 --> 01:19:59.965
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay, I'll take it.

01:20:00.125 --> 01:20:01.106
[SPEAKER_04]: You went to Trader Dan's, right?

01:20:01.626 --> 01:20:05.168
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember, but then I went somewhere else and I found a Saturn with everything.

01:20:05.208 --> 01:20:08.090
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay, well, I'll just have a spare one in case it parts or something.

01:20:08.150 --> 01:20:08.270
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:20:09.111 --> 01:20:10.932
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you have to replace your battery every month.

01:20:11.906 --> 01:20:19.452
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, well now we're getting all nostalgic and what better time than to bring out DarkSakura's classic game of the week.

01:20:19.532 --> 01:20:31.901
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's right, part A is coming to an end and this is the part of the show where we like to let DarkSakura reminisce a little bit about games you may have missed and I honestly think damn near everyone missed this game DarkSakura is going to do this week.

01:20:32.201 --> 01:20:38.466
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of excited to hear a little more about it so I will stop the suspense, cue the music and let DarkSakura take it away.

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:54.562
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's classic game slash obscure slash whatever game I pick of the week is Magical Fantasy Adventure Popful Mail.

01:20:55.563 --> 01:20:56.404
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's a mouthful.

01:20:56.784 --> 01:20:57.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:20:57.985 --> 01:21:04.371
[SPEAKER_04]: It was released originally on the PC-98 and PC-88 system in Japan.

01:21:05.492 --> 01:21:08.815
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sort of like Ys.

01:21:09.915 --> 01:21:11.716
[SPEAKER_04]: You side-scroll adventure.

01:21:11.736 --> 01:21:12.776
[SPEAKER_04]: It has RPG elements.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:14.037
[SPEAKER_04]: You can change out your weapons.

01:21:14.057 --> 01:21:19.060
[SPEAKER_04]: You can change out your items and talk to people and all the stuff.

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:27.424
[SPEAKER_04]: It was released in Japan afterwards on Super Famicom, on PC Engine CD, and on the Mega CD.

01:21:27.944 --> 01:21:31.906
[SPEAKER_04]: And over here, we actually got the Sega CD version thanks to Working Delays.

01:21:32.006 --> 01:21:32.887
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Working Designs.

01:21:34.207 --> 01:21:38.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Working Designs are also the lovely people that brought Silhouette Mirage, the...

01:21:40.624 --> 01:21:43.046
[SPEAKER_04]: Growlancer series, Lunar.

01:21:44.367 --> 01:21:47.129
[SPEAKER_04]: They were very, very good to us.

01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:54.795
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this game you were playing a little busty elven girl called Popple, no, called Mail.

01:21:55.775 --> 01:22:03.261
[SPEAKER_04]: And you play as her friends and you go around trying to, you know, save things.

01:22:03.321 --> 01:22:06.784
[SPEAKER_04]: Her friend the sorcerer Tat and the little dragon guy named Gaul.

01:22:07.484 --> 01:22:09.666
[SPEAKER_04]: And you fight bad guys called Nutscracker.

01:22:10.638 --> 01:22:11.579
[SPEAKER_04]: and Muttonhead.

01:22:12.379 --> 01:22:13.780
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a guy named Nutzcracker.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.440
[SPEAKER_04]: Nutzcracker.

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.561
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I like this guy.

01:22:17.522 --> 01:22:22.705
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a pretty... Who's this that Mail's talking to right now in our little clip we're playing in the background?

01:22:22.765 --> 01:22:26.106
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just like the very start of the game.

01:22:26.126 --> 01:22:28.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone who's just going to help out.

01:22:29.308 --> 01:22:31.189
[SPEAKER_03]: Say, why do you take me with you?

01:22:31.589 --> 01:22:33.090
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you have lots of adventures.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:37.352
[SPEAKER_08]: Why else would you have such a huge... I love the huge anime eyes and smile.

01:22:37.492 --> 01:22:38.313
[SPEAKER_08]: It's you?

01:22:38.946 --> 01:22:41.147
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so hungry, I can eat an okra!

01:22:41.167 --> 01:22:43.988
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it sounds like.

01:22:44.548 --> 01:22:48.309
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the old CD games never had good music with them.

01:22:48.689 --> 01:22:49.990
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, good voice acting.

01:22:50.010 --> 01:22:51.030
[SPEAKER_08]: Music was really good.

01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:53.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the voice acting wasn't really too bad.

01:22:53.171 --> 01:22:55.031
[SPEAKER_04]: They at least tried.

01:22:55.051 --> 01:23:01.573
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem I had with working designs is that they would put stuff into the game that just was not there and usually kind of crass humor.

01:23:02.233 --> 01:23:03.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Like with Rayearth.

01:23:04.534 --> 01:23:07.155
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, they actually made improvements when they brought out Rayearth on Saturn.

01:23:08.274 --> 01:23:18.721
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, like, they took out the fact that they speak dialogue every time you touch an item, which cut down on the, uh, it had intense loading time on the game.

01:23:19.301 --> 01:23:24.725
[SPEAKER_04]: But they put in all these jokes, like there was one about, you know, Harry Palms.

01:23:24.825 --> 01:23:25.105
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

01:23:25.566 --> 01:23:28.968
[SPEAKER_04]: But, this was a fun game.

01:23:29.048 --> 01:23:30.089
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a lot of fun.

01:23:30.869 --> 01:23:36.113
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you know, it had the classic cutscenes and, you know, it's just very...

01:23:37.372 --> 01:23:40.093
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, mid-90s game fun.

01:23:40.133 --> 01:23:41.274
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's all I can say it is.

01:23:41.714 --> 01:23:49.537
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually was surprised with my copy because I had played it back in the day when a friend of mine had imported it.

01:23:50.977 --> 01:23:52.698
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, it got its U.S.

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:56.379
[SPEAKER_04]: release, and I didn't have a Sega CD at the time, so I never actually got it.

01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:01.221
[SPEAKER_04]: And one day, Dan came home with this huge box for me to open at Christmas.

01:24:01.761 --> 01:24:05.383
[SPEAKER_04]: And inside this huge box, it was supposed to be like a space heater.

01:24:06.326 --> 01:24:07.828
[SPEAKER_04]: was my game at the bottom of the box.

01:24:08.849 --> 01:24:09.289
[SPEAKER_08]: How funny.

01:24:09.729 --> 01:24:12.132
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually own an original Popful Mail now.

01:24:12.532 --> 01:24:12.812
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

01:24:12.853 --> 01:24:18.678
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's a good game of the week because I bet a lot of people missed that one, but some folks in chat seem to recognize it and applaud that pick of the week.

01:24:18.718 --> 01:24:21.301
[SPEAKER_08]: Popful Mail is your classic game of the week.

01:24:22.066 --> 01:24:30.772
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that, Part A comes to a close, but fear not, we'll be back in just a little bit with Part B. So stay tuned, and thanks for downloading Orange Lounge Radio.
