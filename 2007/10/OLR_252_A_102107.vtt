Tonight, October 21st, 2007, Street Fighter is back for more in SF4, Sega brings its characters

00:20.960 --> 00:26.120
to a new tennis game, and a classic video game movie returns to at least one big screen.

00:26.120 --> 00:31.640
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.640 --> 00:36.560
Hello everybody out there on the Internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.560 --> 00:41.640
We are that podcast on the Internet dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:41.640 --> 00:42.800
lifestyle.

00:42.800 --> 00:43.800
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:43.800 --> 00:48.520
Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.520 --> 00:49.520
Hi.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.520
How are you doing, Jamie?

00:50.520 --> 00:51.520
I'm here.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.520
You're here?

00:52.520 --> 00:53.520
I'm here too.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.920
And we're here to talk about games.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.520
So joining us, the one and only Loki.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.520
Hello.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.160
How are you doing, Loki?

00:59.160 --> 01:00.160
I'm doing fine.

01:00.160 --> 01:04.200
Now, I notice, and probably the folks on the operator 11 feet are noticing too, unless my

01:04.200 --> 01:07.920
big old butt's blocking the way, that you actually have a little Guitar Hero 3 box laid

01:07.920 --> 01:08.920
out here.

01:08.920 --> 01:09.920
Tell us the story.

01:09.920 --> 01:10.920
What's going on here?

01:10.920 --> 01:15.880
I have a Guitar Hero 3 demo kit that retailers would be getting and anybody that has the

01:15.880 --> 01:19.600
Guitar Hero 3 game playing in their store would be getting one of these.

01:19.600 --> 01:25.240
And inside is the brand new guitar for Guitar Hero 3 for the 360, except it's kind of rare

01:25.240 --> 01:27.720
because it is a wired version instead of wireless.

01:27.720 --> 01:28.720
Interesting.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.480
Not that I really give a damn if it's wireless or not, I mean, because that's one less battery

01:32.480 --> 01:33.480
I need, so.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.400
Now, are we going to be unboxing that on operator 11 a little later?

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
Yeah, sure, why not?

01:37.400 --> 01:38.400
All right, sounds good.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.400
So check that out.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.440
Remember, we do always webcam our show as well on operator11.com.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.200
Usually it's pretty boring, but just sitting here watching our big talking faces doing

01:47.200 --> 01:50.880
the show, but now we have little cool things like this to show you guys, and we'll talk

01:50.880 --> 01:53.760
about that later, and show you guys the interchangeable face plate on the guitar, which I thought

01:53.760 --> 01:54.760
was pretty neat.

01:54.760 --> 01:58.040
I still haven't figured out how to take that off completely, I'm afraid I'm going to break

01:58.040 --> 02:03.760
it and I don't want to, but they do have face plates that they're going to be selling.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.920
I've seen them, they're kind of ugly, but hey, they're face plates.

02:07.920 --> 02:08.920
All right.

02:08.920 --> 02:12.880
Well, let's start off the show talking about our gaming week, so we'll go over to Dark

02:12.880 --> 02:13.880
Soccer.

02:13.880 --> 02:16.040
How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?

02:16.040 --> 02:19.160
It was very singular.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.120
Meaning you only showed love to one game?

02:21.120 --> 02:22.120
Ragnarok.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.120
Of course, Ragnarok.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.760
How was the Ragnarok addiction going?

02:24.760 --> 02:26.040
It was great.

02:26.040 --> 02:31.500
I've got another character up to the second job level now.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.020
What exactly does that mean in English?

02:34.020 --> 02:37.880
It means you have a first job level and a second job level, and I hit the second job

02:37.880 --> 02:40.040
level.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.640
So what are your jobs?

02:41.640 --> 02:43.760
Are you still that one where you kick people in the face?

02:43.760 --> 02:46.460
Well, yeah, I've got that one.

02:46.460 --> 02:50.960
She's on the second part of kicking people in the face.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.400
Like first you learn how to kick people in the face with your right foot, and then you

02:53.400 --> 02:54.400
learn about your left foot?

02:54.400 --> 02:55.400
Is that how it works?

02:55.400 --> 03:00.200
Actually, I'm working on a merchant to blacksmith now, and I have, what do I have now?

03:00.200 --> 03:06.440
I have two crusaders, a blacksmith, a fire mage, who I'm building up to sage.

03:06.440 --> 03:12.760
I have two assassins, one of them hit level 91 this week.

03:12.760 --> 03:16.840
I have a dancer who looks like a hoochie.

03:16.840 --> 03:17.840
Fun.

03:17.840 --> 03:18.840
Yeah.

03:18.840 --> 03:19.840
All right.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.840
Well, enjoy your Korean MMOs.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.240
Of course, we'll go over to the chat room.

03:23.240 --> 03:27.440
Our always present fourth guest on the program, chat.orangelongeradio.com, especially tonight

03:27.440 --> 03:30.280
because unlike weeks past, we're actually kind of quiet here in studio tonight.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.800
It's just the three of us, so we have to show a little love to our chat room.

03:33.800 --> 03:38.760
We always love the comments, and we'll start off tonight with Wetu says, of course, dark

03:38.760 --> 03:42.880
Sakura and Korean MMOs, of course.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.740
Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:45.740 --> 03:48.480
My gaming week was pretty filled.

03:48.480 --> 04:00.680
I would say, God, let me start off with I played Conan on Xbox 360, and it's interesting.

04:00.680 --> 04:05.440
It's actually very much of a rip off of God of War, but that's not a bad thing.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.880
It's still a pretty good game.

04:07.880 --> 04:12.200
And let's see, I also tried, of course, Beautiful Katamari, and I actually finished that game

04:12.200 --> 04:15.240
because it's very short.

04:15.240 --> 04:22.920
I tried the, what else did I play here, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

04:22.920 --> 04:25.480
I tried the demo for that.

04:25.480 --> 04:29.640
You know, it's a good looking game.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.920
The cars look good.

04:30.920 --> 04:35.680
The track that they picked, though, to showcase it, I wouldn't have picked that one, just

04:35.680 --> 04:40.960
because it really doesn't look that great, and you know, minor complaints, and I know

04:40.960 --> 04:46.320
this is kind of nitpicking, but the rear view mirrors on your car, for example, the side

04:46.320 --> 04:52.360
rear view mirror lacks a lot of the detail that's in like your center rear view mirror,

04:52.360 --> 04:56.320
so it makes no sense why they couldn't just have the same level of detail on that stuff.

04:56.320 --> 05:01.240
Also, the crowds still are like little, you know, canned animation things, and I know

05:01.240 --> 05:02.240
that Project...

05:02.240 --> 05:03.240
Paper dolls?

05:03.240 --> 05:06.440
Which, I know Project Gotham does the same thing, but you know what, Project Gotham looks

05:06.440 --> 05:11.240
way better, and you know, this isn't really a huge deal right now because Project Gotham

05:11.240 --> 05:17.200
is only on 360, but come, you know, a year from now when Project Gotham Racing 5 is probably

05:17.200 --> 05:21.720
going to be coming out, and Gran Turismo 5 is coming out at the same time, sadly enough,

05:21.720 --> 05:24.560
I think a lot of people are going to buy Project Gotham over in Gran Turismo.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.160
Wait, back up, though, doesn't Microsoft own the Project Gotham?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.560
They just sent it out to Bazaar to do it, so...

05:29.560 --> 05:32.760
Yeah, but I don't know if that, if they own the rights to the game or not.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.280
It might be just Bazaar's game.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.560
I'm pretty sure Project Gotham is a Microsoft IP.

05:36.560 --> 05:40.800
I know you told me about this for the show, but now it's like, I'm pretty sure, unlike

05:40.800 --> 05:46.480
Mass Effect, Project Gotham Racing is a Microsoft IP that they gave to Bazaar Creations.

05:46.480 --> 05:52.680
Let me put it this way, I mean, your choices for sim racing games on the Playstation 3,

05:52.680 --> 05:57.840
or even the Playstation 2, were pretty much limited to Gran Turismo, and that's it.

05:57.840 --> 06:01.680
If you don't want, if you're looking for a sim racing game, that was your only choice,

06:01.680 --> 06:03.800
for the most part.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.820
So probably at the Playstation 3, it's going to be the same deal.

06:06.820 --> 06:10.720
I'm just saying, you know, for them, putting all this hype behind it, and trying to even

06:10.720 --> 06:17.240
sell this kind of demo of a game before it comes out, you know, officially, I don't know,

06:17.240 --> 06:19.240
it's not, it's not that great.

06:19.240 --> 06:23.640
But if you're really dying to play some Gran Turismo, I highly recommend checking out the

06:23.640 --> 06:27.600
demo first, and then judging it based off that, see if you want to buy it or not.

06:27.600 --> 06:33.720
It looks good, but I just, you know, after seeing the video, the video of it looked really,

06:33.720 --> 06:37.720
really nice, but when you're playing the game, it's not as nice, so I don't know.

06:37.720 --> 06:43.600
I'm trying to think if there's anything else that I played that was really awesome.

06:43.600 --> 06:47.640
I think that's pretty much it, other than, you know, Saints Row, because I've always

06:47.640 --> 06:49.360
been playing Saints Row now.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.360
Always.

06:50.360 --> 06:54.720
My gaming week, yeah, I spent a large part of my week in Southern California, no, I did

06:54.720 --> 06:57.000
not go to E for All, actually.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.480
I decided instead of going to E for All, I was going to go to Disneyland, because, and

07:00.480 --> 07:03.160
I think I've said this on the show before, I felt like if I was going to go to E for

07:03.160 --> 07:08.080
All, I was going to end up working, quote unquote, the whole time, and honestly, I just

07:08.080 --> 07:13.400
felt that the games to see at E for All, there was just going to be huge crowds for all that

07:13.400 --> 07:19.280
stuff, and the media invites I was getting, not a lot of real wowing kind of stuff, so

07:19.280 --> 07:23.720
I said, you know what, I'm going to just take a real vacation from both of my jobs, Orange

07:23.720 --> 07:28.160
Orange Radio and my day job, and I'm going to go to Disneyland, so I spent the week playing

07:28.160 --> 07:32.120
Buzz Lightyear once again, and I got the number 17 high score for the day one time I played,

07:32.120 --> 07:36.160
I have a picture to prove it, heh heh, anyway, no, but seriously, other video games I've

07:36.160 --> 07:40.280
been playing, I did play Typing of the Dead before I left, because I remember we had this

07:40.280 --> 07:43.200
story on the show a couple weeks ago, where we were talking about how they added Typing

07:43.200 --> 07:48.120
of the Dead to GameTap, I'm like, I've got to go play that, and it's still as wonderful

07:48.120 --> 07:52.440
as I remember it, and it runs great on the computer, so I was very happy about that.

07:52.440 --> 07:56.640
Even though it is the PC version that GameTap is emulating, not the Dreamcast version, but

07:56.640 --> 08:00.000
they still do have the Dreamcast strapped to their backs, and that's, you know, the

08:00.000 --> 08:02.440
part we all know and love.

08:02.440 --> 08:08.160
Also, a large majority of my gaming week otherwise was spent playing E4, the other E4, not the

08:08.160 --> 08:14.080
Expo, but every Xtend Xtra Xtreme, which came out on Xbox Live this week, which I think

08:14.080 --> 08:18.440
the game has a lot more depth than you might realize at first, because there is the main

08:18.440 --> 08:22.640
game mode, which, I don't even know how to explain this, is basically a game of setting

08:22.640 --> 08:24.520
off chain reactions.

08:24.520 --> 08:28.440
Basically you explode your ship, and you're trying to set off chain reactions with other

08:28.440 --> 08:31.520
things that are floating around the screen, but there's a catch.

08:31.520 --> 08:36.280
Even though your ship regenerates once the chain reaction is done, your shields are only

08:36.280 --> 08:39.440
on for about two seconds once you regenerate.

08:39.440 --> 08:43.280
After those two seconds are up, anything on the screen can kill you, so you want to commit

08:43.280 --> 08:46.600
suicide before something on the screen kills you, because if something on the screen kills

08:46.600 --> 08:48.800
you, you basically have to go back to start.

08:48.800 --> 08:53.520
The game time is limited to three minutes, but you can collect power-ups throughout the

08:53.520 --> 08:54.520
game.

08:54.520 --> 08:58.240
You can collect a power-up to extend your game time, a power-up to extend your shield

08:58.240 --> 09:03.120
time, a power-up to make things float on the screen faster and increase the beats of the

09:03.120 --> 09:06.720
song, that's what they call the quicken, or you can pick a power-up that increases your

09:06.720 --> 09:08.640
bonus multiplier.

09:08.640 --> 09:13.220
Basically that's essentially the core component of the game, so you get higher and higher

09:13.220 --> 09:17.080
bonuses if you actually detonate your ship in time to the music.

09:17.080 --> 09:23.160
It's a game by Tetsuya Mizuguchi who did Luminous and a bunch of other stuff I love, and I played

09:23.160 --> 09:27.520
every Sin Extra on the PSP, so I knew I was going to like this game, and I do.

09:27.520 --> 09:31.320
The game has a lot of depth, it has the regular game mode, and then it has a shooter mode,

09:31.320 --> 09:35.320
it's called the revenge mode, where you can go around and actually, it's just a shooter,

09:35.320 --> 09:39.520
it doesn't even bother with the music or the exploding, it just shoots things.

09:39.520 --> 09:43.680
So that was kind of interesting, but then there's another mode, and it's pretty intricate

09:43.680 --> 09:49.080
the way they set it up, but you can actually, using the whole media center and doing the

09:49.080 --> 09:53.480
MP3s on your Xbox 360 through the network, you can actually configure every Sin Extra

09:53.480 --> 09:59.440
Extreme to read those songs, and you can work with the game to either auto-detect the BPM

09:59.440 --> 10:04.240
or set the BPM by button-tapping or whatever, so you can use your own songs in the game,

10:04.240 --> 10:09.180
which is kind of cool, it's kind of fun to be able to play the game with your own songs.

10:09.180 --> 10:12.320
So that being said, the game has a lot of depth, and I think it is worth the $10, but

10:12.320 --> 10:18.920
the game has some really major flaws, I think, and one is the fact that I managed to keep

10:18.920 --> 10:23.600
a game going for 70 minutes the other day, and I found that I was getting very bored

10:23.600 --> 10:28.560
of the default songs, so I was very surprised that unlike the PSP version, the game did

10:28.560 --> 10:33.860
not increment in stages, and I realized maybe that's a different game, this wasn't necessarily

10:33.860 --> 10:37.120
supposed to be a direct port of the PSP version, but I kind of liked that better when there

10:37.120 --> 10:41.240
was that more sense of accomplishment as opposed to the fact of, I've survived for 70 minutes

10:41.240 --> 10:44.200
now and my thumbs are getting numb, so I'm just going to suicide, which is what I ended

10:44.200 --> 10:46.920
up doing.

10:46.920 --> 10:52.480
The other thing that actually kind of makes me wonder why they chose to do this in the

10:52.480 --> 10:56.840
game is that the graphics aren't that good, and I was kind of surprised, like compared

10:56.840 --> 11:01.300
to the PSP version, which has these very bright visuals and different types of backgrounds

11:01.300 --> 11:08.120
and different skins, I kind of felt that this game just had white on black, and the types

11:08.120 --> 11:12.440
of objects that would float around the screen would change depending on what stage you were

11:12.440 --> 11:17.800
playing, and the little ships that get into it as well, that's really about it, like the

11:17.800 --> 11:21.880
backgrounds don't change too much, granted when you set off big combos, you get some

11:21.880 --> 11:26.680
different rainbow patterns like the familiar cover looking chick and the rainbow circles

11:26.680 --> 11:33.000
and stuff, but there wasn't the amazing seizure-inducing backgrounds of the PSP version, and I kind

11:33.000 --> 11:37.180
of was disappointed, like I was expecting a little more from the game graphically, especially

11:37.180 --> 11:42.240
with such a vibrant game like Luminous, and I understand the game relies on the chains

11:42.240 --> 11:46.300
and the explosions to kind of give that vibrance, but I don't know, I kind of felt it was boring,

11:46.300 --> 11:51.620
there wasn't a lot to entertain me after 70 minutes of playing one round of this game,

11:51.620 --> 11:55.780
so it kind of didn't add up to a lot, so that was a bit of a disappointment, but overall

11:55.780 --> 11:59.360
I think it is a good value for money, especially if you're not a PSP owner, I think it is a

11:59.360 --> 12:00.360
fun game.

12:00.360 --> 12:04.080
I did play a little bit of Luminous because they have the new content, I neglected to

12:04.080 --> 12:09.740
download the holiday pack, but I did download the new Genkai Rocket song, Breeze, mediocre

12:09.740 --> 12:14.200
at best, I did not enjoy Breeze, which is sad because I love love love love love Heavenly

12:14.200 --> 12:20.140
Star and I love the video, but Breeze is basically the same concept for the video, the cartoon

12:20.140 --> 12:25.080
Asian girl bouncing around, which makes sense because Genkai Rockets is supposed to be like

12:25.080 --> 12:30.560
a, sorry, it's supposed to be like a cartoony band or whatever it is, you know, I don't

12:30.560 --> 12:31.560
know.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.040
Cartoon Heroes did it.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.440
So did Gorillaz, but you know, it's just, at least, Gorillaz did it best, but there's

12:37.440 --> 12:42.440
different, well you're a fangirl, there's different, there's variance in the Gorillaz

12:42.440 --> 12:46.600
videos, you know what I mean, like their videos are all different, say what you will, like,

12:46.600 --> 12:48.080
dislike, all the videos are different.

12:48.080 --> 12:52.040
Actually actually actually, the videos only got different when you got to Demon Days,

12:52.040 --> 12:55.680
the first album ones were not different.

12:55.680 --> 12:56.680
They need to vary it up a little bit.

12:56.680 --> 13:00.720
Well, I mean, they couldn't keep that level of, you know, I mean, Heavenly Star and, you

13:00.720 --> 13:04.960
know, Shining were both really good, and, you know, eventually they're going to have

13:04.960 --> 13:06.560
to have a mediocre song.

13:06.560 --> 13:11.960
All right, going to chat room for some comments, chat.orangelandradio.com, pikaruno says, the

13:11.960 --> 13:15.680
new seasonal luminous life pack is awesome and you should buy it right now.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.880
I've heard good things about it, so I'm contemplating buying it, we'll see.

13:18.880 --> 13:22.400
As long as I don't have any speed mixes of fucking Christmas songs.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.400
Oh, yes, please no.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.640
I'm looking at you, DanceMania, I'm looking at you.

13:26.640 --> 13:31.120
Gerardimo says, they're trying to set you up with microtransactions like in Luminous,

13:31.120 --> 13:35.480
who knows, maybe, maybe that's where my backgrounds are, there are going to be microtransactions

13:35.480 --> 13:36.480
later on.

13:36.480 --> 13:39.600
Well, I refuse, I'm putting my foot down this time on the microtransactions, damn it.

13:39.600 --> 13:43.200
So you're paying less than a penny?

13:43.200 --> 13:49.640
Well, look, it's, I know we've had this discussion about micro and macrotransactions, but that's,

13:49.640 --> 13:54.480
you know, despite, it's still what people call it.

13:54.480 --> 13:58.400
Gerardimo is also still having fun with the E4 demo.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.960
Darktids Studio says, Loki, what, speed mix of Jingle Bells doesn't do it for you?

14:01.960 --> 14:02.960
No, it doesn't.

14:02.960 --> 14:03.960
It doesn't.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.960
All right.

14:04.960 --> 14:10.680
Oh, GS68 would also like to point out, speeding up a song does not equal a remix.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.680
Good point.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.360
All right, well, that's going to do it for our gaming weeks.

14:14.360 --> 14:18.360
So adding heavy synth to it does make it Eurobeat.

14:18.360 --> 14:19.360
It might.

14:19.360 --> 14:23.880
And, you know, having some guy singing about fire, whatever, if I just insert blank of

14:23.880 --> 14:25.280
fire and it's instant Eurobeat.

14:25.280 --> 14:28.440
Oh, we'll get into remix stuff later on.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.360
I have some complaints with certain artists out there.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.360
Oh my.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.360
All right.

14:33.360 --> 14:37.120
Did I mention that Luminous does have, or I'm sorry, not Luminous, Every Sin Extra Extreme

14:37.120 --> 14:40.280
does have a remix of Heavenly Star in it.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.280
It's not that great.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.280
I'm sorry to say.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.280
You probably have already heard it, too.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.280
Maybe.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.280
All right.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.040
Let's go into tonight's news.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.280
We don't have a lot of housekeeping tonight.

14:50.280 --> 14:54.120
I will then, therefore, use the opportunity to plug our communities.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.840
Myspace.com slash OrangeLoungeTrader.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.640
Add us as your friend on Myspace.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.480
We post bulletins with extra stuff.

14:59.480 --> 15:03.440
We actually did a whole bonus show last week because of our outage after the show, and

15:03.440 --> 15:07.800
so we posted it to our Myspace people and the live journal people at Orange Lounge.

15:07.800 --> 15:12.400
We also have a community on Facebook, but I've been irritated with Facebook lately because

15:12.400 --> 15:16.940
I'm getting sick of getting the invites for, so and so wants you to be on their team for

15:16.940 --> 15:18.040
quiz show.

15:18.040 --> 15:21.080
So and so wants you to join them in the battle of ninjas versus pirates.

15:21.080 --> 15:25.840
I'm like, this so and so doesn't give two shits and is thinking about deleting his account.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.480
Did you hear that the Mass Effect characters are now on Facebook looking for friends?

15:29.480 --> 15:32.560
I could give a shit, honestly.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.120
I hope they find no friends on Facebook.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.600
I am not happy with Facebook.

15:36.600 --> 15:40.440
Facebook was cool like six months ago before they started adding all the, like you would

15:40.440 --> 15:46.520
think usually like user created mods are a good thing for almost everything you can think

15:46.520 --> 15:47.520
of.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.520
No.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.880
Not Facebook.

15:49.880 --> 15:55.200
Facebook has somehow proven that, you know, user enabled created mods can single handedly

15:55.200 --> 15:56.560
make your site suck balls.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.920
Just like user created themes for Myspace.

15:59.920 --> 16:03.080
Now everybody's yelling at me to just block the applications.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.760
Can I block everything?

16:04.760 --> 16:06.960
Can I just put, is there like a box, block everything?

16:06.960 --> 16:08.360
Maybe I'll do that.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.520
I didn't even know that was a feature.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.440
See, this is why I love chat.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.440
Chat educates me.

16:12.440 --> 16:16.380
In fact, I will check Facebook right now while we get into some gaming news.

16:16.380 --> 16:17.680
So let's start off.

16:17.680 --> 16:24.560
So during this week there was a wonderful event in London, Capcom's Gamers' Day, and

16:24.560 --> 16:29.360
of course their bombshell announcement for that event would be Street Fighter IV.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.200
Oh my God, it's coming.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.680
I mean I'm not too surprised that there's a Street Fighter IV, that's like saying there's

16:35.680 --> 16:39.160
not going to be a Halo 4 or something like that, I mean come on.

16:39.160 --> 16:44.380
But okay, it is Street Fighter IV, it's supposed to continue with the 2D series, it's not going

16:44.380 --> 16:47.400
to be 3D, so far at least.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.400
Thank God.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.400
That's a good thing.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.400
That is a good thing.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.760
And it doesn't have, you know, any other funky titles.

16:53.760 --> 16:58.240
Although they didn't really show too much, they did have a nice teaser video showing

16:58.240 --> 17:00.080
both Ken and Ryu fighting.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.600
It was, I'm sorry, the teaser video was lame.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.580
I mean it was nothing more than like a hype the crowd type thing when I'm sitting there

17:06.580 --> 17:09.840
watching it on the computer, I'm thinking, show me the game.

17:09.840 --> 17:14.560
I hate these stupid cinematic, like teasers that are nothing but cinematics, the CGI rendering.

17:14.560 --> 17:18.360
We're in a day and an age of gaming where we know that's just all the BS cut scenes.

17:18.360 --> 17:20.160
Like I want to see some actual game.

17:20.160 --> 17:23.480
It would be awesome though if it was in that art style, because it was kind of like a water

17:23.480 --> 17:26.880
colored type thing, but no.

17:26.880 --> 17:32.520
So Street Fighter IV, it's going to be a fighting game, it'll probably be awesome, and out sometime

17:32.520 --> 17:33.520
someday.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.520
Yay!

17:34.520 --> 17:40.920
Now let's see, GS68 says, nobody will play Street Fighter IV, arcade scene has been reduced

17:40.920 --> 17:44.480
down to initial D4, and when, again, midnight, maximum 2 and 3.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.200
Oh, people will play Street Fighter IV.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.320
Well, because they're not going to gun for the arcades necessarily.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.280
They're going to use Xbox Live and PlayStation Network to get people to play.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.280
People still play the damn arcades.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.840
I mean, come on, people still play Tekken there.

17:55.840 --> 17:56.840
People still go to the arcades.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.360
But there's still arcades out there.

17:58.360 --> 18:02.000
There's not as many arcades, because arcade games have gotten more expensive, and if you

18:02.000 --> 18:06.160
don't have the foot traffic, you're not going to be able to pay for your $6,000 game.

18:06.160 --> 18:09.840
So that's why arcades are failing.

18:09.840 --> 18:16.360
It's not because people stopped going to them, it's just that games got more expensive.

18:16.360 --> 18:20.240
Out of curiosity, why would I bother to go to an arcade if I can just plug it in on my

18:20.240 --> 18:22.920
Xbox 360 and sign into Live and play?

18:22.920 --> 18:25.720
Because the D-pad sucks on Xbox 360.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.360
Ouch, good point.

18:27.360 --> 18:28.360
Touche.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.160
What can ever replace the arcade experience?

18:31.160 --> 18:32.160
That's true.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.800
I know this is interesting coming from me on this program when you consider the three

18:35.800 --> 18:38.480
of us all met, Hal, at an arcade, right?

18:38.480 --> 18:44.200
But you know, arcades, they're saying in chat, they really have become nothing but gambling

18:44.200 --> 18:46.200
for children and the ticket spitters.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.600
It's sad.

18:47.600 --> 18:52.340
Every good arcade I've ever known is gone or replaced with something that is under the

18:52.340 --> 18:58.460
disguise of a good arcade, but it's not, I don't know, I'm sad.

18:58.460 --> 19:02.960
So are you excited, I know you're a Capcom fighting girl fan, Dark Sakura, are you excited

19:02.960 --> 19:03.960
about Street Fighter IV?

19:03.960 --> 19:04.960
Hell yeah!

19:04.960 --> 19:07.340
What do you hope they do differently this time?

19:07.340 --> 19:08.340
Take out Chun-Li.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.680
No, they can't do that!

19:10.680 --> 19:12.220
And put in Sakura.

19:12.220 --> 19:15.440
Why would, they would never take out Chun-Li, why would they do that?

19:15.440 --> 19:18.860
Because I'm sick of all of the fanboyism, seriously.

19:18.860 --> 19:26.920
It's like, okay, her moves are all, she's like, I'm trying to, after a while, you know,

19:26.920 --> 19:30.440
a character is in a game and you kind of like him at first, and then you just get so sick

19:30.440 --> 19:33.760
of seeing them all the time, that you just want something fresh.

19:33.760 --> 19:38.480
If they're gonna do, I would love to see Sakura in the game, older.

19:38.480 --> 19:44.160
I would like to see Ibuki come back, because Ibuki was my Street Fighter III person.

19:44.160 --> 19:51.200
And I want to see the guy with one arm taken out, what was his name, Oro?

19:51.200 --> 19:53.120
He needs to leave.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.120
And they need to...

19:54.120 --> 19:57.200
He needs to come back, but missing another arm, or a leg or something.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.200
That'd be awesome.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.200
The joke will continue.

19:59.200 --> 20:03.240
Because then he'd be Elena, and fight with his legs.

20:03.240 --> 20:06.040
She was cool too, she needs to come back.

20:06.040 --> 20:11.920
And they need to actually have, you know, do they have any characters in the game who

20:11.920 --> 20:12.920
use Taekwondo?

20:12.920 --> 20:19.000
Uh, Footy Monster says, Dark Sakura, fuck you, leave my beautiful thunder thighs alone.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.160
Hey, I have a kick power, thank you.

20:22.160 --> 20:26.600
I think that they should take Street Fighter IV and actually add other Capcom characters

20:26.600 --> 20:29.840
into it, instead of just this Capcom versus shit.

20:29.840 --> 20:33.640
Then you'd have Puzzle Fighter.

20:33.640 --> 20:37.240
Not Puzzle Fighter, but Pocket Fighter.

20:37.240 --> 20:40.360
I'm all fine with them putting in new characters.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.520
You know, why not have some new characters to sell?

20:43.520 --> 20:45.680
Like, you know, Soul Calibur III kind of did it.

20:45.680 --> 20:50.520
They had the guy with the big old sickle and stuff, you know, they were able to sell out

20:50.520 --> 20:51.520
new characters.

20:51.520 --> 20:56.400
Seriously, don't follow the route of Tekken 6, I mean, because Bob, the fat guy that sort

20:56.400 --> 21:00.860
of looks like Mario, and no, that's not a cool character.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.720
You know what I would like to see?

21:02.720 --> 21:05.860
I would like to see a tag mode.

21:05.860 --> 21:08.560
Like the versus games.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.560
I think that would be cool.

21:09.560 --> 21:15.780
I also really wouldn't mind just another Capcom versus game that isn't like, what was it,

21:15.780 --> 21:16.780
Fighting Evolution.

21:16.780 --> 21:21.880
I want them to go back to the Marvel versus Capcom style that they did, because that was

21:21.880 --> 21:25.160
probably one of their most solid fighting games.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.760
But I wanted to have like a, you know what they need to do?

21:28.760 --> 21:32.760
Instead of doing Street Fighter IV, we need another freaking CyberBots.

21:32.760 --> 21:35.640
Blaze in our chat room is getting in on the Capcom crossover madness.

21:35.640 --> 21:39.600
He says Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth in Street Fighter IV.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.680
Objection.

21:40.680 --> 21:46.480
They should just do a new game series called Capcom versus and then do like a new installment

21:46.480 --> 21:47.480
each year.

21:47.480 --> 21:51.840
No, I think they should focus on Street Fighter IV and making it good, and I don't think they

21:51.840 --> 21:53.720
should do any of this crossover bullshit.

21:53.720 --> 21:57.800
I think they should focus on making a new original fun game.

21:57.800 --> 22:02.100
To talk to Son of Dad for a moment, they, first of all, the Final Fight characters were

22:02.100 --> 22:06.240
in the Alpha series, and that is, it's a different type of game.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.080
It plays different than How 3 was.

22:08.080 --> 22:11.400
I mean, I kind of liked How 3 was with the parrying system.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.560
I thought that was cool and that needs to stay.

22:14.560 --> 22:19.800
Especially because I have one time parried a Shoryuken, so that was really cool.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.640
That was my awesome moment.

22:22.640 --> 22:27.120
But I think that they need to have a few more unique styles.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.120
I thought it was really good.

22:28.120 --> 22:29.180
They had a boxer in there.

22:29.180 --> 22:34.320
They had, you know, the stupid one-armed guy that kind of grossed me out that would have

22:34.320 --> 22:35.320
the style.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.320
They need a luchador.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.320
They need a luchador.

22:37.320 --> 22:38.320
No, they had one.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.320
They had Vega.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.320
He wasn't really a luchador, though.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.320
No, not a luchador.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.320
I'm thinking Matador.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.680
No, they do need a luchador.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.680
They need Mexican wrestling.

22:47.680 --> 22:50.440
That'd be cool.

22:50.440 --> 22:55.920
They need, well, there was Armeika in there.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.720
In fact, Screw just a luchador.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.760
They just need Santo in there.

22:59.760 --> 23:08.840
No, they need to, oh god, they need a, well, not like a wrestler wrestler, but they need

23:08.840 --> 23:10.720
like a big brawler.

23:10.720 --> 23:15.240
Not like Zangief was, but just like this brute character.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.240
Like T-Hawk?

23:16.240 --> 23:18.640
No, T-Hawk was a wrestler.

23:18.640 --> 23:25.840
They need this, just like the slow punch, like, oh god, who was it in Darkstalker?

23:25.840 --> 23:27.880
Suddenly this game is turning into Saturday Night Slammasters.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.360
The mummy guy?

23:29.360 --> 23:34.360
Yeah, they need something like that, where they're slow and tough, but, you know, that's

23:34.360 --> 23:35.440
just the thing.

23:35.440 --> 23:37.520
They're slow and tough, and that's what's frustrating about them.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.520
Do another Darkstalkers game.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.520
That'd be kinda cool.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.440
They need a, we need a good Darkstalkers game.

23:41.440 --> 23:45.080
Okay, I love these comments from chat rooms on the crossover games.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.760
GS68 says, fuck crossovers.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.200
Stop feeding the fanboys.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.680
Sephiroth1215 says, Street Fighter is only for Street Fighter characters.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.080
You want other Capcom characters?

23:53.080 --> 23:54.960
Play the Wacky Versus series.

23:54.960 --> 24:00.760
Hey, I was hoping they'd come out with that other, another Sega Versus series, you know.

24:00.760 --> 24:04.920
All I have to say is, thank god they're sticking with 2D, because I seem to remember there

24:04.920 --> 24:08.520
was a 3D Street Fighter game, like, Roselle Golfland had it, didn't they?

24:08.520 --> 24:09.520
And it was, oh god.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.520
There was a 3D.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.520
It was so horrible.

24:11.520 --> 24:15.680
See, Son of Dad is saying exactly what I was thinking, that they need more unique styles

24:15.680 --> 24:16.780
in the game.

24:16.780 --> 24:23.000
And also, just to talk to hitson, I actually like Darkstalkers 3, and I've actually played

24:23.000 --> 24:25.720
it where all the sprites on the screen, the character sprites on the screen were missing

24:25.720 --> 24:29.480
because my employer at the time when I worked for an arcade was fixing it while I was playing

24:29.480 --> 24:32.840
it, and beat the game that way.

24:32.840 --> 24:37.600
But um, Fighters Megamix 2, that's a good idea.

24:37.600 --> 24:38.840
Oh, thank you.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.960
The chat room reminded me, I'm thinking of the EX series.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.280
Those were the 3D ones.

24:42.280 --> 24:45.360
Yeah, and Dark Knight reminds me that Capcom didn't do the 3D ones.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.360
No.

24:46.360 --> 24:51.760
Well, they should, like, sue whoever did it, again, just because people actually remember

24:51.760 --> 24:55.360
how horrible those games are, so they should sue them again if they haven't already.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.160
You know what game that I would like for them to make?

24:57.160 --> 25:02.120
And this is what I would totally call it, too, is Capcom Fighting Universe.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.160
Just a big clusterfuck of every character ever, or something?

25:04.160 --> 25:05.680
You have your Rival Schools characters.

25:05.680 --> 25:06.680
Oh, lordy.

25:06.680 --> 25:10.640
You have your Alpha characters, you have your She-Fighter 3, you have your Cyberbot.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.640
They did something like that, though.

25:12.640 --> 25:13.640
They did that one.

25:13.640 --> 25:14.640
Fangirl alert.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.640
Fangirl alert.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.680
I think that was, like, Capcom Fighting Evolution or something like that.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.680
Yeah, but that game sucked.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.160
Capcom Fighting Evolution sucked.

25:22.160 --> 25:24.200
They need to just do...

25:24.200 --> 25:28.280
You get the wolf from Okami, you get, you know, the guy from Dead Rising.

25:28.280 --> 25:31.960
You choose your mode at the beginning of the game, and everyone fights in the same mode.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.620
Alright, too much fanboy stuff for me.

25:34.620 --> 25:38.680
We gotta move on with the other Capcom news, and speaking of the wolf from Okami, Okami

25:38.680 --> 25:41.160
for the Wii has been confirmed.

25:41.160 --> 25:45.100
Okami is coming to the Nintendo Wii in the spring of 2008.

25:45.100 --> 25:48.720
If you've played Okami, it's the kind of game that really could benefit from some motion

25:48.720 --> 25:53.160
controls, and certainly the game will be making use of the Wii-mote controls.

25:53.160 --> 25:57.320
The motion controls will be used primarily for the Celestial Brush.

25:57.320 --> 26:01.160
I'm actually excited about this because Okami's kind of one of those games everybody said

26:01.160 --> 26:04.400
I should play and I didn't really get to play enough of, like, there was just so many games

26:04.400 --> 26:08.000
coming out around that time, so this kind of allows a lot of people like me to take

26:08.000 --> 26:11.500
a second look, just like when Resident Evil 4 came out for the Wii.

26:11.500 --> 26:12.500
Same thing.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.100
I think it's a good choice for them to bring it there.

26:14.100 --> 26:17.640
I think it's an excellent choice, so I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out, Okami

26:17.640 --> 26:18.640
on the Wii.

26:18.640 --> 26:24.160
I don't know, and this is kind of off the subject a little bit, but I'm surprised they

26:24.160 --> 26:28.320
even brought Viewtiful Joe to the Wii, but then that made me think, how much do you want

26:28.320 --> 26:33.360
to bet that there might be a character announced that's Viewtiful Joe for Super Smash Bros.?

26:33.360 --> 26:34.360
Interesting.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.360
I don't know.

26:35.360 --> 26:39.560
Because they did have that game that was sort of like Smash Bros. with Viewtiful Joe, but...

26:39.560 --> 26:43.160
I think Viewtiful Joe's on ice for a little bit, and that's just fine, because, like...

26:43.160 --> 26:44.160
It sucked.

26:44.160 --> 26:47.880
Well, it started good, but then it was one of those, like, saturation...

26:47.880 --> 26:50.120
It was a really good concept.

26:50.120 --> 26:53.760
But it got too oversaturated, so I think Capcom's doing the smart thing right now, and Viewtiful

26:53.760 --> 26:57.360
Joe, at least it seems to me anyway, is on ice for a little while, and that's just fine

26:57.360 --> 26:58.360
by me.

26:58.360 --> 26:59.360
The series needs to be on ice.

26:59.360 --> 27:02.880
Well, there is a little bit more good Capcom news.

27:02.880 --> 27:09.840
They have released word about a game called Dark Void that will be out next winter, developed

27:09.840 --> 27:16.640
by Airtight Games, and they gave us Crimson Skies Hyrule to Revenge, so it is supposed

27:16.640 --> 27:23.520
to be mid-air and on foot, and they haven't said what it's going to be on, although they're

27:23.520 --> 27:30.620
thinking PS3 and Xbox 360, so it's a game where you go against these...

27:30.620 --> 27:34.760
They're called the Watchers, and they've been watching, and now they stopped watching and

27:34.760 --> 27:35.760
are doing...

27:35.760 --> 27:37.240
What have they been watching me do?

27:37.240 --> 27:38.240
Porn.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.240
They watch...

27:39.240 --> 27:40.240
Oh, noes.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.240
Ceiling Watchers are watching you fap.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.080
Oh, noes.

27:44.080 --> 27:50.160
Well, hooray for original ideas, right, because this is a whole new IP for them, right?

27:50.160 --> 27:51.160
Yeah.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.160
It's a new world.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.160
Well, good.

27:53.160 --> 27:59.280
Well, folks that may have owned a PS3 and not a 360 may have missed out on the Lost

27:59.280 --> 28:00.280
Planet series.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.280
Well, fear not.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.280
Capcom...

28:02.280 --> 28:03.280
Unless you owned a computer.

28:03.280 --> 28:07.600
Unless you owned a PC, but who owns a PC nowadays?

28:07.600 --> 28:09.680
I mean, seriously, nobody.

28:09.680 --> 28:10.680
Totally.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.280
Yeah, nobody owns a computer.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.040
Who plays games on PCs anymore?

28:14.040 --> 28:15.760
That's just ridiculous talk.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.760
Anyways.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.520
No, but seriously, Lost Planet is coming to the PS3.

28:19.520 --> 28:24.200
They're going to have all the features and download content that was available for the

28:24.200 --> 28:26.320
PC and Xbox 360 versions.

28:26.320 --> 28:29.560
It's supposed to come out in the spring, so hooray!

28:29.560 --> 28:34.920
You get your Lost Planet in almost a year later.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.620
Are they doing anything extra for it?

28:36.620 --> 28:37.620
Extra levels?

28:37.620 --> 28:38.620
Extra characters?

28:38.620 --> 28:39.620
Extra...

28:39.620 --> 28:40.620
Just the download content.

28:40.620 --> 28:41.620
That's pretty much it.

28:41.620 --> 28:48.000
I mean, it's not really that extra, I guess.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.520
There's all the bonus stuff that was available already.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.080
No dress-up mode?

28:52.080 --> 28:53.080
No.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.080
No.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.080
That's too bad.

28:55.080 --> 28:58.160
It says apparently now that it can fit all that stuff on the Blu-ray disc, so that's

28:58.160 --> 29:00.040
why it wasn't downloading content now.

29:00.040 --> 29:01.920
I like Son of Dad's comment in chat.

29:01.920 --> 29:07.440
Son of Dad says in chat, chat.orange.onnashray.com, Lost Planet PlayStation 3?

29:07.440 --> 29:08.440
No.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.640
Dead Rising PlayStation 3?

29:10.640 --> 29:12.120
Yes.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.120
That would be sweet.

29:13.120 --> 29:17.800
And honestly, if they're looking for a game that would take advantage of their little

29:17.800 --> 29:23.440
shaker controller-like-an-idiot function, then Dead Rising would be a good one to eat

29:23.440 --> 29:24.440
too.

29:24.440 --> 29:27.840
But here's the thing, and this is kind of good news for you guys, because if you think

29:27.840 --> 29:32.720
about it, I would think that they would pick Dead Rising over Lost Planet anyways, because

29:32.720 --> 29:36.160
I think Dead Rising sold more anyways.

29:36.160 --> 29:41.760
So that means, to me, that means that they're making a sequel, so instead of porting the

29:41.760 --> 29:44.600
original, they're just going to make a sequel for both platforms.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.680
Well duh, they've got to be making a sequel.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.600
How could they not be making a sequel to Dead Rising?

29:48.600 --> 29:49.600
That game exceeded expectations.

29:49.600 --> 29:53.320
Please God, fix the damn save system, because that was horrible.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.920
I stopped playing the game because of that, sadly.

29:56.920 --> 30:00.040
That and the fact that my monitor sucked at the time, so I couldn't see anything in the

30:00.040 --> 30:01.040
dark.

30:01.040 --> 30:04.240
But, um, fix the save system.

30:04.240 --> 30:10.160
Well, also coming out of Capcom Gamers' Day, lots of news from Gamers' Day this week, Super

30:10.160 --> 30:14.520
Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix was playable at the show.

30:14.520 --> 30:17.820
Only Ken and Ryu were actually selectable in the game, but that didn't prevent some

30:17.820 --> 30:22.320
crappy YouTube video from going up, and folks could actually kind of see the game in motion.

30:22.320 --> 30:26.760
We'll also announce there are some changes that we hadn't heard yet for what we have

30:26.760 --> 30:28.520
in store for the game.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.800
The HD Remix, of course, supports widescreen, you know, we kind of figured that would happen.

30:32.800 --> 30:37.200
The music has all been completely remixed for the game, which doesn't actually surprise

30:37.200 --> 30:40.340
me too much, I think we needed that too.

30:40.340 --> 30:47.280
There will also be, however, not just the HD version, but an arcade mirror of the Super

30:47.280 --> 30:51.420
Street Fighter II Turbo arcade version, so if you want your purest version, that will

30:51.420 --> 30:53.400
be included in the game.

30:53.400 --> 30:58.080
Also, apparently, some balancing has gone into effect, some rebalancing, I'm not sure

30:58.080 --> 31:03.400
if that means some attacks do more damages or some characters' movements are different

31:03.400 --> 31:06.500
or what have you, but there has been some rebalancing done.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.940
Not the first time Capcom's gone back and rebalanced one of their games, just take a

31:09.940 --> 31:14.640
look at Puzzle Fighter II, had some rebalancing going on with the drops, but if you wanted

31:14.640 --> 31:19.800
to, you could also play in your arcade perfect nothing has been changed mode, which I think

31:19.800 --> 31:23.760
is the way to do it in this day and age when you revisit your retro classics, yes?

31:23.760 --> 31:24.760
Yeah.

31:24.760 --> 31:25.760
All right.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.960
I'm looking forward to that, even though I am still a little bitter, I've bought Street

31:28.960 --> 31:34.360
Fighter II on Xbox once, you have to kind of think, all right, the same thing happens

31:34.360 --> 31:41.160
with over-the-counter games, this is just kind of like getting number two in the series

31:41.160 --> 31:45.800
or whatever, I don't know how else to phrase it.

31:45.800 --> 31:53.240
Well, one other thing that I think is very, very, very cool, and I'm very, very, very

31:53.240 --> 31:59.800
excited about this, is that Bionic Commando is getting a remake.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.400
Fuck yeah, it's about fucking time.

32:01.400 --> 32:02.400
Fuck yes.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.400
This is an amazing game.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.200
I wonder if you still get to kill Hitler in it.

32:05.200 --> 32:08.680
No, but it still looks awesome if you've seen the video for it.

32:08.680 --> 32:13.640
I've only seen the little preview that showed the screenshots, I've not seen the game in

32:13.640 --> 32:14.640
motion.

32:14.640 --> 32:15.640
No, the video is, oh yeah.

32:15.640 --> 32:20.240
Because I was a little nervous about the 3D looking, I mean.

32:20.240 --> 32:26.360
Well, at any rate, it's going to be on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

32:26.360 --> 32:31.080
You know, I'm noticing that we're getting a lot more, what would have been usually a

32:31.080 --> 32:36.360
console or only game on the PC now, there's a lot more love for PC gamers.

32:36.360 --> 32:41.040
I don't know why, no one plays games on the PC anymore, seriously, nobody.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.440
You know you just got yelled at by several people in chat.

32:43.440 --> 32:46.420
I beat sarcastic people, shit, come on.

32:46.420 --> 32:47.480
Are you that dumb?

32:47.480 --> 32:49.480
Of course people play games on a PC.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.120
How many million people play WoW?

32:51.120 --> 32:56.680
That would mainly get our first person shooters on PC, but now we're seeing more and more

32:56.680 --> 33:02.120
of them on consoles, and we're seeing more and more platformers come out for PC.

33:02.120 --> 33:06.720
So it's like, the whole gaming community is now sort of banding together.

33:06.720 --> 33:10.320
Well remember folks, the PlayStation 3 is a computer, remember?

33:10.320 --> 33:11.320
No it's not.

33:11.320 --> 33:16.400
No, but according to the marketing, that's a little more accurate.

33:16.400 --> 33:17.400
Yes it is, no it's not.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.400
Yes it is, no it's not.

33:18.400 --> 33:26.280
Well at any rate, Capcom is working with Grin, they did a Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

33:26.280 --> 33:35.720
PC, and it also, they have not announced a Wii release.

33:35.720 --> 33:42.240
And Tigerclaw in our chat room has something to say about the lack of a Wii buy on a Commando.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.040
Surprisingly, no Wii version.

33:44.040 --> 33:47.740
The game looks like something perfect for the Wii mode, and it's surprising that they're

33:47.740 --> 33:49.120
not making it for it.

33:49.120 --> 33:54.200
Nintendo could have cashed in on it by re-releasing the original NES version on the Virtual Console.

33:54.200 --> 33:58.120
Well they'll probably still try to cash in on it anyways, but here's the problem though

33:58.120 --> 33:59.320
with the Wii.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.220
It can't handle the game!

34:01.220 --> 34:05.600
Just because it has the little waggle controls and stuff that would be perfect for this.

34:05.600 --> 34:09.480
Unfortunately Nintendo decided, hey you know what, we don't really care about graphics,

34:09.480 --> 34:12.280
so sorry, can't make that.

34:12.280 --> 34:15.560
However if they had ported it to the PlayStation 2, yeah we could port that pretty easy.

34:15.560 --> 34:19.600
But wait a minute though, ultimately that was Capcom's decision to say we're going

34:19.600 --> 34:28.720
to go for the highest quality in looks and sound department as opposed to incorporating

34:28.720 --> 34:29.720
the wiggle waggles.

34:29.720 --> 34:34.720
You have to understand that people on the PlayStation 3 and 360 love action games, much

34:34.720 --> 34:41.640
like Dead Rising, Lost Planet, the new Bionic Commando game and stuff like that.

34:41.640 --> 34:47.360
Wii gamers only like Zack and Wiki Quest for Rose Treasure.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.600
That's the only thing that they can handle.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.400
Oh yeah, that's my favorite fucking game right there.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.400
That and Resident Evil 4.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.040
It's a little mixed up there, but you know.

34:55.040 --> 35:02.320
I think that Capcom could do something if they were willing to focus on gameplay more.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.920
Then again, one of the things I've always enjoyed about many Capcom games is that they

35:05.920 --> 35:09.420
do tend to have really good gameplay.

35:09.420 --> 35:10.840
Fuck that, maybe some more Mega Man Legends.

35:10.840 --> 35:11.840
I can go on the Wii.

35:11.840 --> 35:12.840
Perfect.

35:12.840 --> 35:13.840
Done.

35:13.840 --> 35:14.840
That's a series that needs to die.

35:14.840 --> 35:18.840
And M64 wants to remind you also on the Wii, mini games.

35:18.840 --> 35:19.840
My mistake.

35:19.840 --> 35:20.840
Lots of mini games.

35:20.840 --> 35:21.840
Bionic Commando mini games.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.840
Oh look, pop the bubbles.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.840
Kill Hitler again and again.

35:25.840 --> 35:26.840
Wii.

35:26.840 --> 35:27.840
Oh yeah.

35:27.840 --> 35:28.840
Who knows.

35:28.840 --> 35:29.840
Wii.

35:29.840 --> 35:36.280
Dapho in the chat room would like to say Zack and Wiki looks awesome, how dare that be bashed.

35:36.280 --> 35:39.120
How dare you Loki on this program.

35:39.120 --> 35:44.080
On this show, there's not much that we don't dare to do at different times.

35:44.080 --> 35:47.800
Son of Dad would like to remind us all that Okami's being ported to the Wii and not to

35:47.800 --> 35:49.880
next gen with sharp graphics.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.880
So the Wii is getting kind of something that.

35:51.880 --> 35:55.240
I think it's been proven that the Wii can handle cel shading fairly well.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.760
Isn't Okami cel shaded?

35:56.760 --> 36:00.960
I'm just awfully surprised that Wii's getting yet another PlayStation 2 port.

36:00.960 --> 36:06.720
That's surprising with Resident Evil 4 and all those other fucking games that PlayStation

36:06.720 --> 36:10.120
2, Xbox 360 ports, or Xbox ports.

36:10.120 --> 36:16.800
Ryoma says if you're going to do the Bionic Commando mini games, pick Hitler's nose.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.040
Like that one game in WarioWare.

36:20.040 --> 36:22.560
This just in on the Smash dojo.

36:22.560 --> 36:25.640
Hitler, the new character.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.880
I don't know about that one.

36:28.880 --> 36:32.120
I don't think so.

36:32.120 --> 36:41.720
And M64 reminds you very subtly, but not really, that RE4 was a GameCube port, not a PS2 port.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.620
I believe it was a PlayStation 2 port for this one because it had the upgraded graphics

36:44.620 --> 36:47.680
from the PlayStation 2 and the additional features.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.040
But yeah, it was on the GameCube too.

36:49.040 --> 36:54.620
So they could have hybrid, you know, some bastard child of the GameCube and PlayStation

36:54.620 --> 36:55.620
2 versions.

36:55.620 --> 36:58.120
So what you're basically trying to say is I'm right and you're wrong.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.120
Yes!

36:59.120 --> 37:03.120
That's exact, thank you for nailing home my point there.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.120
You're welcome.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.120
That's what I do here.

37:05.120 --> 37:09.560
All right, since these games won't be out until next year at the earliest, let's talk

37:09.560 --> 37:12.400
about some stuff you can get right now, this week.

37:12.400 --> 37:17.320
Definitely, and there's going to be lots of fun stuff coming out this week.

37:17.320 --> 37:25.880
Some stuff, I don't know, people, why you want them or not, but of the many things the

37:25.880 --> 37:31.320
ever controversial Eye of Judgment is coming out this week on PlayStation 3.

37:31.320 --> 37:37.840
Yes, you will be able to play your Magic the Gathering type of crap with the eye, the PlayStation

37:37.840 --> 37:38.840
Eye.

37:38.840 --> 37:43.280
And remember folks, if one million copies of this game sell, Loki will dress up in a

37:43.280 --> 37:47.240
tingle outfit and set an Eye of Judgment on fire for your very pleasure.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.660
He should dance around it.

37:48.660 --> 37:51.000
I think you should do this anyway because it'll be so fun.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.520
I'm not going to do that.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.520
You should burn it.

37:53.520 --> 37:54.520
Stop trying to cop out.

37:54.520 --> 37:58.680
Okay, if it doesn't sell a million though, while we will not require you to dress as

37:58.680 --> 38:02.120
tingle, you need to at least wear the hat and burn it.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.720
What hat?

38:03.720 --> 38:08.520
Can we negotiate that maybe if they can sell 50,000 units, you'll just wear the little

38:08.520 --> 38:10.400
green hat and set it on fire?

38:10.400 --> 38:11.920
I'm not doing that.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.560
It's all or nothing.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.560
Damn it.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.360
Will you at least set one on fire?

38:18.360 --> 38:20.720
Maybe if someone sends me one for free, I'll set one on fire.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.760
We should dance around it.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.560
I'm not going to buy one to set one on fire.

38:24.560 --> 38:25.560
That's stupid.

38:25.560 --> 38:26.560
Let's see.

38:26.560 --> 38:27.840
If we all put in 20 bucks, we could buy one to set on fire.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.840
Come on.

38:28.840 --> 38:29.840
Anyways.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.840
BurnMyEyeOfJudgment.com.

38:30.840 --> 38:39.800
Ace Combat 6 is coming out on Xbox 360, so that's pretty interesting.

38:39.800 --> 38:40.800
I don't know.

38:40.800 --> 38:41.960
It's a good game.

38:41.960 --> 38:45.320
Client Marker's Jericho is coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.440
It's a horror first person shooter game.

38:48.440 --> 38:53.680
Conan also coming out in both systems as well, and as I reviewed it, it's pretty good, so

38:53.680 --> 38:56.880
definitely worth checking it out.

38:56.880 --> 38:57.880
Let's see.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.280
King of Fighters XI on PlayStation 2.

39:00.280 --> 39:04.320
And that's a really budget game too, $14.99 if I remember correctly.

39:04.320 --> 39:08.240
Dancing with the Stars on the Wii and PlayStation 2.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.240
And you know what?

39:09.240 --> 39:10.240
Yippee.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.240
That sounds fun.

39:11.240 --> 39:12.240
Actually, it's only on the Wii this week.

39:12.240 --> 39:16.940
PlayStation 2 is coming out later, but sadly enough, it doesn't look that bad.

39:16.940 --> 39:21.720
The models in it look pretty decent, and the game's kind of a rhythm music game.

39:21.720 --> 39:25.000
Do you have the professional dancers that are on the show?

39:25.000 --> 39:28.280
Yeah, the show dancers, whoever's on the show.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.280
I don't watch the show.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.440
But are there celebrities programmed in?

39:31.440 --> 39:36.440
Yeah, there's celebrities in there, but they move pretty smooth from the video I saw.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.080
I'm not buying it, but hey.

39:38.080 --> 39:41.560
Well, I think it would be a good idea if they used the X-Tango engine.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.160
It might be cool to rent it.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.720
I don't know if it's the X-Tango engine.

39:44.720 --> 39:45.720
Hold on.

39:45.720 --> 39:49.200
Are you guys actually hyping the Dancing with the Stars video game?

39:49.200 --> 39:50.200
I would do it.

39:50.200 --> 39:51.900
Dude, it's like 20 bucks, okay?

39:51.900 --> 39:53.360
I like Dancing with the Stars.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.360
I like X-Tango.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.640
I guess I'll give you that.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.640
Hey, hey.

39:56.640 --> 40:01.440
I'm not saying this game is X-Tango, okay, because we're not going to dirty the X-Tango

40:01.440 --> 40:02.440
name with this game.

40:02.440 --> 40:03.440
Sorry.

40:03.440 --> 40:04.440
My bad.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.440
Apologies to the folks behind X-Tango.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.480
Actually, I do like Dancing with the Stars, Rob.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.480
Really?

40:08.480 --> 40:09.480
But you don't watch TV, I thought.

40:09.480 --> 40:15.280
I watch the dances on YouTube, because it was all about the Stacey Keebler series.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.280
Okay.

40:16.280 --> 40:20.160
PlayStation 3 is getting quite a few games here.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.840
Juice 2, Hot Import Nights, yeah, you're finally getting that now.

40:22.840 --> 40:26.600
Ratchet and Clank, Future Tools of Destruction, that should be pretty awesome.

40:26.600 --> 40:30.040
Ratatouille, that's coming out.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.840
And let's see here.

40:32.840 --> 40:38.360
On the Wii, actually in PlayStation 2 as well, Nicktoons Attack of the Toy Bots.

40:38.360 --> 40:42.240
This week also, the game I was just making fun of, Zack and Wiki, the Quest for Barbaros

40:42.240 --> 40:44.180
Treasure is also coming out.

40:44.180 --> 40:45.180
How dare you.

40:45.180 --> 40:50.640
Namco Museum Remix, hooray, that's also coming out on the Wii.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.640
And then let's see here.

40:52.640 --> 41:01.640
Of course, on PSP, Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles, Warriors of the Lost Empires, I have no idea

41:01.640 --> 41:09.320
what that is, and then see Spongebob Atlantis Squarepantis also coming out as well.

41:09.320 --> 41:19.760
And on the DS, Phoenix Wright Trials and Tribulations, Mega Man X, or Mega Man ZX Advent, and Spanish

41:19.760 --> 41:23.120
for Everyone, Naruto Path of the Ninja.

41:23.120 --> 41:25.840
Wait, is that the name of a game, Spanish for Everyone?

41:25.840 --> 41:26.840
Spanish for Everyone.

41:26.840 --> 41:30.640
I want to say there's- What do you do in Spanish for Everyone?

41:30.640 --> 41:32.640
You learn Spanish.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.760
Oh.

41:34.760 --> 41:44.480
Let's see here, Chess Master, The Art of Learning, that's what it's called, Imagine Master Chef.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.760
I think the rest of the Imagine games are coming out this week.

41:46.760 --> 41:47.760
Oh, that's right.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.360
Imagine Animal Doctor is also coming out.

41:50.360 --> 41:51.600
Imagine Babies.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.960
Imagine Fashion Designer and Imagine Master Chef.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.240
Finally, Imagine Babies.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.240
You know what I want?

41:56.240 --> 41:58.280
I want Imagine Sniper.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.640
Sorry.

41:59.640 --> 42:04.080
Unfortunately, Sniper's not that popular with little girls.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.080
I wanted to be a sniper.

42:05.080 --> 42:09.240
When it does become popular, they will have Imagine Snipers, but unfortunately, they don't

42:09.240 --> 42:10.240
right now.

42:10.240 --> 42:11.840
GS68 says, Imagine John Lennon.

42:11.840 --> 42:17.280
Imagine, or I'm sorry, Pocket Pets, which is yet another pet raising sim, and apparently,

42:17.280 --> 42:22.560
judging by the cover, it features bunnies, kittens, and little birdies.

42:22.560 --> 42:25.080
Yay.

42:25.080 --> 42:27.280
Where's the hippopotamuses, or hippopotami?

42:27.280 --> 42:31.660
Tiger Claws says, Imagine OLR, by the way.

42:31.660 --> 42:38.040
And then, I was going to say also, Naruto Clash of Ninja Revolution on Wii, and finally

42:38.040 --> 42:41.480
just a small little game, of course, on almost everything.

42:41.480 --> 42:46.720
PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, Wii, and maybe the PC this week.

42:46.720 --> 42:50.760
And actually, a week from now, Guitar Hero 3 will be making its way out.

42:50.760 --> 42:51.760
So.

42:51.760 --> 42:52.760
Excellent.

42:52.760 --> 42:53.760
On a Sunday.

42:53.760 --> 42:54.920
Wait, is that out this Tuesday?

42:54.920 --> 42:55.920
It's out on next Sunday.

42:55.920 --> 42:56.920
Oh, it's on Sunday.

42:56.920 --> 42:58.760
On the 28th.

42:58.760 --> 43:02.840
Because they have to be so cool Sunday.

43:02.840 --> 43:06.560
This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, Guitar Hero 3, for everybody.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.560
Let's see here.

43:07.560 --> 43:10.640
I was going to say, I'm looking real quick on the PC stuff.

43:10.640 --> 43:16.600
Oh, there are some interesting PC games I was going to mention real quick.

43:16.600 --> 43:21.720
Dream Day Honeymoon, which I have no idea what that is, but I want to take a look here

43:21.720 --> 43:22.720
real quick.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.480
You want to go on a Dream Day Honeymoon?

43:24.480 --> 43:25.480
Dream Day Honeymoon.

43:25.480 --> 43:28.080
Actually, there's no information for that whatsoever, but that is available if you're

43:28.080 --> 43:30.200
curious.

43:30.200 --> 43:34.480
And some Agatha Christie game.

43:34.480 --> 43:35.480
That's it.

43:35.480 --> 43:39.800
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and see what our friends overseas in Japan are picking

43:39.800 --> 43:40.800
up this week.

43:40.800 --> 43:48.080
You can get on the Xbox 360, Bladestorm, the 100 Years War is coming out on the Xbox 360.

43:48.080 --> 43:53.000
That's from Koei, who I believe brought you Dynasty Wars.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.840
And oh, I forgot to mention, US Tomb Raider Anniversary on the 360.

43:57.840 --> 43:58.840
It's my turn now.

43:58.840 --> 43:59.840
My turn.

43:59.840 --> 44:00.840
I'm done.

44:00.840 --> 44:01.840
I'm done.

44:01.840 --> 44:02.840
Alright.

44:02.840 --> 44:04.400
Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party.

44:04.400 --> 44:10.000
You Bimani fans over in Japan get a chance now with the Wii version of DDR, the latest

44:10.000 --> 44:14.760
title finally hitting Japanese shelves this week.

44:14.760 --> 44:16.920
I remember back in the day, it used to be the other way around.

44:16.920 --> 44:20.920
Japan would get these games years before we would get them, and now it seems like we get

44:20.920 --> 44:21.920
a few of these first.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.620
Because I think the same thing happened with Supernova 2, I don't remember.

44:25.620 --> 44:31.340
Also on the Nintendo Wii, Ghost Squad is coming out from Sega in Japan.

44:31.340 --> 44:34.840
Also coming out on the Wii, the Simple Wii series.

44:34.840 --> 44:41.480
There's volume 1, the Mina de Kart Race, and there's volume 2, the Mina de Basuri Takai

44:41.480 --> 44:42.720
is coming out.

44:42.720 --> 44:46.480
So I'm assuming that's like fishing and kart racing?

44:46.480 --> 44:47.880
It's like a Mario Kart game.

44:47.880 --> 44:48.880
Yeah.

44:48.880 --> 44:51.560
That's fucking awesome that the Simple series is coming to the Wii.

44:51.560 --> 44:52.560
Interesting.

44:52.560 --> 44:56.480
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, a game from Sega, it's an action-adventure game, it looks

44:56.480 --> 44:57.600
kind of scary.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.840
It's called Imabe Kisu.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.640
Do we have this game over here, or is this something that's coming out, being ported

45:02.640 --> 45:03.640
over here?

45:03.640 --> 45:05.440
I have not heard of this game, and I don't see screenshots.

45:05.440 --> 45:06.440
No.

45:06.440 --> 45:07.440
Let me see if I can find it.

45:07.440 --> 45:08.440
What was it?

45:08.440 --> 45:09.440
PlayStation 3, you said?

45:09.440 --> 45:10.440
Yeah, it's on PlayStation 3.

45:10.440 --> 45:13.620
I think it's done by the guy who did the Ring series and stuff like that.

45:13.620 --> 45:14.620
It's kind of like that.

45:14.620 --> 45:17.440
It's kind of a horror type of game.

45:17.440 --> 45:19.480
That might be kind of fun.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.720
Cool.

45:20.720 --> 45:24.280
Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, you've been waiting for this one.

45:24.280 --> 45:25.740
Let's make sure it sells a million copies.

45:25.740 --> 45:29.320
The Eye of Judgment comes out on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

45:29.320 --> 45:34.480
Also coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 2, hey, God of War 2, the end begins.

45:34.480 --> 45:37.920
Finally making its way with a Japanese translation this week.

45:37.920 --> 45:43.580
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Itsuka Todoku Anosora Ni is coming out.

45:43.580 --> 45:48.320
That's an adventure game that looks to be based on yet another anime starring cute little

45:48.320 --> 45:51.360
girls in schoolgirl outfits.

45:51.360 --> 45:56.280
Also coming out on the PlayStation 3, Baldur Bullet Equilibrium coming from Alchemist.

45:56.280 --> 45:59.920
It looks like another mech warrior type game.

45:59.920 --> 46:07.080
On the Nintendo DS, Dungeon Maker, Mahou no Shovel Tu Chisa Na Yuusha.

46:07.080 --> 46:10.600
It's a role playing game, but hence the title, Dungeon Maker.

46:10.600 --> 46:14.420
Some of you guys like to customize your own stuff, you'll probably enjoy that.

46:14.420 --> 46:20.680
Also coming out on the Nintendo DS, Final Fantasy Tactics A2, hooray, I know a lot of

46:20.680 --> 46:23.400
folks have been waiting for the next tactics game on the DS.

46:23.400 --> 46:26.520
If you haven't played the one on the PSP yet, which I've heard a lot of good things about,

46:26.520 --> 46:30.200
although I have not unfortunately picked this title up myself yet.

46:30.200 --> 46:36.000
And lastly but not leastly, I love this title on the Nintendo DS, this is a great title,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.300
The Frog Man Show comes out.

46:38.300 --> 46:39.500
That's the best ever.

46:39.500 --> 46:42.280
On the Nintendo DS.

46:42.280 --> 46:48.520
And it looks to be, they say it's an action game, but it looks like kind of like a bunch

46:48.520 --> 46:49.520
of different little mini games.

46:49.520 --> 46:51.080
It looks like another one of those types of games.

46:51.080 --> 46:53.280
We should have action mini games.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.080
Action based mini games.

46:55.080 --> 46:56.520
That's it for Japanese releases.

46:56.520 --> 47:01.560
Well, moving over to the UK, we have some stuff.

47:01.560 --> 47:06.800
On the 23rd, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, Trials and Tribulations, 26 Aqua Team Hunger

47:06.800 --> 47:12.800
4 Zombie Ninja Pro-Am, I think that's the best name ever.

47:12.800 --> 47:19.800
On the 26th, Castlevania, The Dracula X Chronicles, Clive Barker's Jericho, Coded Arms Contagion,

47:19.800 --> 47:26.400
Escape from Paradise City on PC, I'm sorry on PSP, Escape from Paradise City on PC, Jackass

47:26.400 --> 47:32.080
the Game on PSP, Juice 2, Hot in Fortnite, King of Clubs, Metroid Prime 3, Corruption

47:32.080 --> 47:40.040
on Wii, NBA 2K8, NBA Live 08, NHL 2K8, Paint by DS, Portal on Playstation 3, Pro Evolution

47:40.040 --> 47:46.960
Soccer 2008 on a bunch of stuff, Stranglehold, Siphon Filter Dark Mirror, Team Fortress 2,

47:46.960 --> 47:54.240
The Sims 2 Castaway, The Witcher on PC, Retro Fighter 5, Who the Hell Cares, Wipe Out Pulse

47:54.240 --> 47:57.920
on PSP, and Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 on PSP.

47:57.920 --> 48:00.560
All right, awesome.

48:00.560 --> 48:09.920
Well, in un-gaming release news, apparently this week they've been having some interesting

48:09.920 --> 48:13.640
guests on The Morning Show here in the U.S. and...

48:13.640 --> 48:16.200
Okay, first off, what the hell's The Morning Show?

48:16.200 --> 48:17.200
I've never heard of that.

48:17.200 --> 48:18.200
Is that like a...

48:18.200 --> 48:20.080
That's not The Today Show or anything.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.640
No, it's The Morning Show.

48:21.640 --> 48:22.640
I've never heard of it.

48:22.640 --> 48:23.640
I've never heard of it either.

48:23.640 --> 48:24.640
All right.

48:24.640 --> 48:28.820
Anyways, apparently The Morning Show, I have no idea who that is, features such wonderful

48:28.820 --> 48:37.200
guests as Voldemort and apparently this wonderful woman who goes to bash Halo 3, and actually

48:37.200 --> 48:42.560
I guess just violent games in general, Susan Bartell, she apparently says, when kids play

48:42.560 --> 48:48.280
violent video games, we can see that their brains are different than when they play non-violent

48:48.280 --> 48:50.280
games.

48:50.280 --> 48:54.800
We can see a very big difference in their brains, which tells us how dangerous these

48:54.800 --> 48:59.440
games can be.

48:59.440 --> 49:04.520
Just an FYI, according to Wikipedia, The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet is mostly on Fox

49:04.520 --> 49:06.720
and my network TV stations.

49:06.720 --> 49:09.160
It's syndicated.

49:09.160 --> 49:11.280
Yay!

49:11.280 --> 49:17.520
So basically, they're saying that, I guess she wrapped the whole segment up by saying

49:17.520 --> 49:23.960
they're going to react in the same highly aroused, angry way that we saw what happened

49:23.960 --> 49:24.960
yesterday.

49:24.960 --> 49:29.040
Of course, they were talking about a school shooting that happened in Cleveland that she

49:29.040 --> 49:30.440
was referencing back to that.

49:30.440 --> 49:35.400
Well, here's the interesting thing about that though, you see, because Game Politics

49:35.400 --> 49:40.640
actually went and asked her about that because they had some issues with it.

49:40.640 --> 49:47.640
One of the things that they found concerning, I guess, was a comment when they saw the Indiana

49:47.640 --> 49:52.680
University brain scan pick five minutes before the airing of the show.

49:52.680 --> 49:58.600
So she had looked at basically the brain scan image literally minutes before the show started

49:58.600 --> 50:03.960
and they're saying, well, how can you base your professional opinion on just a brief

50:03.960 --> 50:05.460
glance at it?

50:05.460 --> 50:12.840
And she was saying, well, it's not concrete proof, but that doesn't change anything, blah,

50:12.840 --> 50:13.840
blah, blah.

50:13.840 --> 50:20.160
And they're saying that maybe it was a little bit sensationalized because it's on TV and

50:20.160 --> 50:21.160
stuff.

50:21.160 --> 50:25.120
So they understand how you feel, there's an element of sensationalism to it, I suppose.

50:25.120 --> 50:30.440
I couldn't five minutes before going on air say, sorry, I won't do it.

50:30.440 --> 50:33.480
I don't have enough background information about this brain scan.

50:33.480 --> 50:35.480
I'm not that much of a purist.

50:35.480 --> 50:38.840
So basically she was talking out of her ass.

50:38.840 --> 50:39.840
Awesome.

50:39.840 --> 50:45.600
And then the follow up with the whole thing, Game Politics, also ran another story about,

50:45.600 --> 50:52.240
I guess is being reported in Scientific America, Richard Tremblay, a professor of pediatrics,

50:52.240 --> 51:00.320
psychiatry and psychology said that kids were aggressive before modern media came along.

51:00.320 --> 51:04.320
So we can't blame modern media for kids being aggressive.

51:04.320 --> 51:11.560
Well, then again, wasn't there the study on how underage crime decreased?

51:11.560 --> 51:14.680
People just want to blame something because they don't want to cop up to shit.

51:14.680 --> 51:15.780
That's all it is.

51:15.780 --> 51:20.000
And I hate when they get these experts out there that start blah, blah, blah, blah.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
They tell someone what they want to hear and then they invite them on all these shows.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
All right.

51:25.000 --> 51:28.680
You know I got to get some chat room feedback because you know they are lit up on this story.

51:28.680 --> 51:33.360
Kiki says, I did a report on video games and violence for school and in my research found

51:33.360 --> 51:37.600
that only violent kids get violent in games.

51:37.600 --> 51:41.960
Blaze says, couldn't various games cause the same brain scan read?

51:41.960 --> 51:48.120
Darkshy wants to know why are all school shootings blamed on video games and GS68 is wondering

51:48.120 --> 51:53.080
since we call Tack Jompson because we don't want to call him by name and he's effectively

51:53.080 --> 51:56.640
banned from the show, since we call him Lord Voldemort, just in case you're first time

51:56.640 --> 52:01.160
listening and you wonder who the hell is Voldemort, it's you know that guy, that lawyer guy that

52:01.160 --> 52:07.400
needs to SDF you, GS68 is wondering should we call this lady Bellatrix Lestrange?

52:07.400 --> 52:15.820
To be honest, I don't think she's going to be randomly posting on different websites

52:15.820 --> 52:21.200
about shit making threats and acting purely crazy.

52:21.200 --> 52:25.040
So I don't think we really need to worry about calling her anything else since obviously

52:25.040 --> 52:27.000
she's going to be out of the news.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
We should call her loser.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.720
You know what, I agree with what Shadow Charlie said and honestly I think this just pretty

52:32.720 --> 52:33.840
much sums up our feedback.

52:33.840 --> 52:38.400
Shadow Charlie in our chatroom says she can shut the fuck up.

52:38.400 --> 52:44.980
She really can and you know people like this just get our anger going and our blood boiling.

52:44.980 --> 52:49.360
You knew, you knew when you read this story on Game Politics or wherever you might have

52:49.360 --> 52:53.840
seen it earlier this week, you knew that on this program, this segment would be following

52:53.840 --> 52:56.620
a story about this stupid, stupid woman.

52:56.620 --> 53:13.680
It's the FUs of the week.

53:13.680 --> 53:21.700
My FU of the week goes towards certain things at my place of employment without getting

53:21.700 --> 53:30.680
into too much detail about what I do for a living, I work a job that they assign tasks

53:30.680 --> 53:35.800
to me that I'm supposed to have done within a certain number of days, right?

53:35.800 --> 53:39.200
And on average I do about 70 to 80 a day.

53:39.200 --> 53:47.040
So I come in one day and there's 600 and something of them and so I closed 110 that day which

53:47.040 --> 53:49.040
is a lot more than I usually do.

53:49.040 --> 53:52.640
I came back the next day, there were 704.

53:52.640 --> 53:53.940
I closed 90 that day.

53:53.940 --> 53:58.200
I came back in, there were 780.

53:58.200 --> 54:01.520
So yeah.

54:01.520 --> 54:07.640
I have a right to complain about this because if I don't finish enough of it within my turnaround

54:07.640 --> 54:10.560
time then it comes back and I get dinged for it.

54:10.560 --> 54:20.440
So don't be surprised when certain things happen, is all I'm going to say.

54:20.440 --> 54:24.360
Oh yeah and every time I try to apply for another position at work I'm written up for

54:24.360 --> 54:25.360
something.

54:25.360 --> 54:26.360
Hmm.

54:26.360 --> 54:30.680
Alright, Loki, let loose, FUs of the week.

54:30.680 --> 54:36.160
Fuck you to Kanye West for ruining Harder Better Faster Stronger by Daft Punk and trying

54:36.160 --> 54:42.440
to claim, I guess make his own song by sampling that entire thing.

54:42.440 --> 54:46.640
He's awful as an artist to begin with and I also watched Saturday Night Live, they had

54:46.640 --> 54:50.280
another song that he did where he sampled Pretty Young Thing from Michael Jackson.

54:50.280 --> 54:53.480
Once again an unoriginal bastard who needs to fucking die.

54:53.480 --> 54:59.180
I mean he has no talent and I hate people that fucking sample shit, you know.

54:59.180 --> 55:05.900
Also looking at you Black Eyed Peas, you fucking suck too so FU the both of them.

55:05.900 --> 55:12.160
My FU of the week goes to children that go to Disneyland because kids ruin Disneyland

55:12.160 --> 55:13.160
seriously.

55:13.160 --> 55:17.520
Let's see what else, so what if supposedly Disneyland is for them.

55:17.520 --> 55:19.200
I say they ruin it.

55:19.200 --> 55:24.380
Also FU to the blaring hot sun, it's like October and in LA the sun was shining like

55:24.380 --> 55:30.240
so horribly, it was horrible, so I want to say FU to that and FU to the fact that my

55:30.240 --> 55:32.560
vacation is over and I have to go back to work tomorrow.

55:32.560 --> 55:35.400
That sucks.

55:35.400 --> 55:37.480
That's it though for the FUs of the week.

55:37.480 --> 55:44.360
Let's get back into some news and I'll start it off with a story about Nintendo and guess

55:44.360 --> 55:51.120
what Nintendo has decided that much like Sega's done recently with the Dreamcast, Nintendo

55:51.120 --> 55:57.480
will be ending all hardware support for the Famicom, Super Famicom, Nintendo 64, Game

55:57.480 --> 56:00.240
Boy and Game Boy Pocket.

56:00.240 --> 56:05.360
The reason they're citing, rarity and scarcity of repair parts.

56:05.360 --> 56:10.120
Now when I first read this I was actually surprised, they've still been repairing Famicoms

56:10.120 --> 56:15.760
this long, but apparently they were and unfortunately now it is over.

56:15.760 --> 56:20.860
Again this is just Nintendo of Japan but still, you know, dude seriously if you have a broken

56:20.860 --> 56:25.320
Nintendo now go out and buy something else, I mean seriously, why are you still playing

56:25.320 --> 56:26.320
Nintendo?

56:26.320 --> 56:27.600
Bad news for retro collectors though.

56:27.600 --> 56:30.840
I wonder though if, well you know that means that the prices of these systems are going

56:30.840 --> 56:38.360
to go up because to use pinball as a comparison, for machines that start seeing revivals when

56:38.360 --> 56:43.600
you can start getting parts for them again, the price of the tables goes down but when

56:43.600 --> 56:49.040
they stop making the replacement plastics and stuff for some of the other tables, the

56:49.040 --> 56:50.440
value jumps up by at least $5,000.

56:50.440 --> 56:53.880
To be honest a lot of people that are collecting these retro systems anyways probably know

56:53.880 --> 56:58.600
how to fix them or if they don't know how to fix them, know of somebody who can fix

56:58.600 --> 56:59.600
them.

56:59.600 --> 57:03.560
There are other websites or have extras or there are other people out there that know

57:03.560 --> 57:06.640
how to fix these systems, it's not just Nintendo.

57:06.640 --> 57:10.160
Here's a thought, I bet this is why they're ending the support now.

57:10.160 --> 57:15.360
Why would they want to encourage people to buy the games at garage sales and stuff on

57:15.360 --> 57:19.160
these old systems when they have this brand spanking new virtual console that's delivering

57:19.160 --> 57:20.840
all the games from these old consoles?

57:20.840 --> 57:24.880
This is why they're ending support now, I'll bet you.

57:24.880 --> 57:25.880
Just a thought.

57:25.880 --> 57:27.680
I think it's just because of what they actually said.

57:27.680 --> 57:29.440
No I think I'm right and you're wrong.

57:29.440 --> 57:33.240
Well I mean Game Boy Color, we don't see any Game Boy Color stuff on fucking...

57:33.240 --> 57:34.240
Yet.

57:34.240 --> 57:35.240
Yet.

57:35.240 --> 57:36.240
Oh come on.

57:36.240 --> 57:38.240
It would look like shit.

57:38.240 --> 57:45.140
This is my theory behind it, why waste manpower on something the company itself has decided

57:45.140 --> 57:52.280
was obsolete when they can focus towards their current thing and it's sort of like paying

57:52.280 --> 57:55.960
somebody to fix a Betamax, you know?

57:55.960 --> 58:00.600
I kind of buy that, that makes sense to me, but at the same time, why didn't they do that

58:00.600 --> 58:02.360
ten years ago with the Famicom?

58:02.360 --> 58:03.360
You know?

58:03.360 --> 58:04.840
I mean Famicom's been out like twenty years.

58:04.840 --> 58:08.120
But ten years ago I think that they still had a big enough user base, because ten years

58:08.120 --> 58:10.520
ago, what was it that we were seeing out?

58:10.520 --> 58:15.320
I was still playing my Super Nintendo, I think the N64 had just been out.

58:15.320 --> 58:17.560
Because the Famicom's still probably outselling the PlayStation 3?

58:17.560 --> 58:22.680
And on top of that, the only way you could get any of your retro games is to either own

58:22.680 --> 58:25.600
the old system or to play on emulators.

58:25.600 --> 58:30.960
But now we have it to where all these games are being re-released on, you know, we have

58:30.960 --> 58:37.680
Virtual Console, we have Xbox Live Arcade, and so they're looking at it as progress.

58:37.680 --> 58:43.200
What's the point now when they can get the same thing on one of our more up-to-date systems?

58:43.200 --> 58:46.040
So why should they waste the support and manpower and product?

58:46.040 --> 58:51.080
Well if they make some systems actually put on the market, you know, so we can buy them

58:51.080 --> 58:53.320
to replace our broken Famicom.

58:53.320 --> 58:58.000
Maybe that's why they gotta pull the old support, get some people on the assembly line.

58:58.000 --> 59:04.840
And to go back to my, I guess, analogy to the Betamax, you know, you can't get Sony

59:04.840 --> 59:08.120
to replace your Betamax machine, but you can go to specialty repair shops and they'll do

59:08.120 --> 59:09.120
it.

59:09.120 --> 59:10.120
It's gonna be the same way with old systems.

59:10.120 --> 59:11.120
Alright.

59:11.120 --> 59:15.600
Wow, I didn't think we'd have this much conversation over this story, this was just supposed to

59:15.600 --> 59:17.280
be a little niche piece, but very interesting.

59:17.280 --> 59:22.320
I guess we all in the room feel very passionately about retro gaming, especially Dark Soccer

59:22.320 --> 59:25.680
of course, we've got our classic game of the week coming up in just a little bit.

59:25.680 --> 59:26.680
But first, more news!

59:26.680 --> 59:33.760
Probably five people have heard of, anyway, virtual console stuff for the UK, wee!

59:33.760 --> 59:40.320
So what we are seeing out this time is World Heroes, which was a Neo Geo game.

59:40.320 --> 59:45.880
Not really one of my favorite fighters, but it was pretty, pretty good, and it's 900 points.

59:45.880 --> 59:51.440
And then coming up is a Gate of Thunder from the TurboGrafx-16.

59:51.440 --> 59:57.980
It was made by Hudson, and that was a pretty damn good game, where you have your ship called

59:57.980 --> 01:00:02.280
the Hunting Dog, and you are saving the starlight power.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:06.800
But I think that it's cool because the planet referred to as planet Ares, and I'm an Ares,

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.800
so that's cool.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800
It's 800 points.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.580
And, and then, and for anyone who watches the Angry Nintendo Nerd, you'll know where

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.760
my frustration with this game comes from for exactly the same reason he did.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:24.400
Castlevania II, Simon's Quest for the NES, where, you know, it turns night time, and

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.400
then it turns day time, and then you can't save your game, and you have to start over

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.600
from the beginning, and you lose all your shit, and oh my god that game is frustrating,

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.400
and then Dracula's like, butt easy.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:37.480
Yeah, I remember that too, that was crazy.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:42.000
Now wait, since she's doing dates in the UK, I don't recall we've gotten Simon's Quest

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
in the US yet, right?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.360
I don't think, that's a frickin' awesome game though, despite the frustration, I love the

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.400
game, and honestly, the music is half of what makes that game, so I'm hoping it's over here

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:56.640
on Monday.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.120
I would like to see us get the Japanese version of Castlevania III.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.080
What was the difference between that and this one, I don't...

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.440
It was certain gameplay factions that they took out, like for example, if you use the,

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:10.360
oh god I can't remember his name now, the guy who used the dagger?

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.360
Grant.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.360
Grant, yes.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:16.200
In the Japanese version, he would throw the dagger, and so it gave you range of attack

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.200
with him.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200
Hmm.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.280
Yeah, that's just one of the things I remember.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.520
I always like to use Alucard, because he can turn into the bat.

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:26.200
I like Grant, because he can climb on walls.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.760
I guess that's true, and then there was the guy that had the orbs, right?

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.760
I don't even remember.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.760
That was Saifa.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.760
Wow.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.760
That's old school.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.760
Yeah.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.760
Alright.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.960
Oh, by the way, that's 500 points.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.960
Tigerclaw would like to point out Dark Sakura, also the fact that it had two different endings,

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.800
and one of them, Simon Belmont, dies.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.800
Yes.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.800
That was the other thing.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:50.560
I've played the disc version of it, luckily I've played a disc version of it, and the

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.880
music was also a little bit different, but then again, the disc games had a different

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:54.880
music processor.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.800
I was going to say, didn't they have an extra sound channel in Japan?

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:57.800
Yeah.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.800
For that stuff?

01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.800
Yeah.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.200
I think I remember one of my old roommates, who was really into collecting games, had

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.240
the old, old Castlevania III, and that was part of the reason.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.600
That was the first time I had played it, though.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.680
I played a disc one later on than that, but he brought it over to my house.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.680
Ah.

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.680
I never played it.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.680
Yeah.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.680
Yep.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.680
Alright.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:22.240
Well, soon enough, GameTap will be hitting 1,000 games, and they're supposed to hit this

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:27.320
wonderful landmark achievement on November 15th.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:31.160
But in the meantime, they will be getting some pretty cool stuff this week, including

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.760
Clive Barker's Jericho.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:38.760
And the Sam & Max Season 2 will be starting here pretty soon, on November 8th, with Ice

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:47.640
Station Santa, and I guess Season 1's episode, Abe Lincoln Must Die, I guess is available

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.440
free right now.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:56.440
Mr. Uru Online's final episode in the Season 1 story arc will begin the 1st of November,

01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:02.040
and let's see here, I guess now the first three Hitman games will be free to play for

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:07.080
the non-subscribers, as that part of kind of a free game sampling that they have there

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:09.080
that's ad-supported.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:15.280
And I guess a new season of Revisioned, which before was looking at Lara Croft, Davin said

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.720
which character we're going to do this time, or which series, and then game trailers for

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720
various games.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.720
Alright.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.720
Sounds like fun.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:29.400
I keep neglecting to go back to GameTap and checking out some of those other new games

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.400
that they have, like Blast Miner.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.600
I wanted to check, because now they're starting to put out the indie games, too, and I'm pretty

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.640
sure Blast Miner finally made its way to GameTap, so I gotta check out some of the indie stuff

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.400
they have on there.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:44.240
I still wish, though, they have Civilization III up in their archives, but they don't have

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.600
Civ I.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.040
And I, for whatever reason, and I know I've gone into this tirade on the show before,

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:54.440
so I'll keep it short tonight, but I prefer Civilization I, the old school one, compared

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.080
to any other Civ they've released since then.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:02.720
So Sid Meier, if you happen to be listening, please let them have Civilization on GameTap.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.980
Also I would love you if you'd let them have Covert Action, because that was like my favorite

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:10.960
Sid Meier game ever, and probably nobody's ever heard of it.

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:19.280
Anyhow, speaking of games that you can download quickly, of course we all know the WiiWare

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:23.320
is coming out very soon, and one game people are very excited about on the WiiWare is the

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320
Final Fantasy game.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.600
It's the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Little King in the Promised Country.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:35.880
This game is going to be out March 2008 in Japan, and it's going to be priced at 1,500

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.760
Wii Points, which of course would be $15 here in the US.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.320
So at least this gives you some type of idea to what kind of pricing you're probably going

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.900
to see for the WiiWare, although not too much of a surprise.

01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:50.880
This is pretty competitive with the Xbox Live pricing, because you consider a game like

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.960
Luminous was also $15, a Final Fantasy game is going to be definitely an A-list title

01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.080
for the service, so it's not too surprising that they're going to want to charge $15 for

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.080
that.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.560
Although actually Luminous got a price cut recently, didn't it?

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.560
It's only $10 now.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.560
Not this week.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.560
Yeah.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:07.560
So there you have it.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.800
Looking forward to getting more information on the game, all we know so far is that there

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:16.060
is a main character named the Little King, and he creates towns to basically build up

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.060
a new country.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:22.640
He uses special powers to make elemental skills, and basically this is all used to develop

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.640
the land.

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.480
So it almost sounds like it's some type of sim game, because you get...

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.320
It's like one half of Actraiser.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320
Dirty work.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.720
Hey, no problem with that.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.720
I freaking love Actraiser.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.720
You know what?

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.480
I think if I had a kid, I'd name him Little King.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.680
Son of Dad says, Wii needs a hard drive bad.

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:44.680
Yeah, I am curious how, yeah, I am also curious how the Wii is going to fit all this stuff

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.680
in here.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.120
I wouldn't be surprised, Nintendo's going to come out sometime next year.

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.280
That's what the SD cards are for.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.280
Not just that.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.880
They're going to come out at some point, and they're going to say, we have this super hidden

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.160
expansion port thing, and we're bringing out this thing.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:03.920
If you invert your Wii, you'll find the port hidden somewhere on the system of the board.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.160
Well, there are expansion ports that aren't being used on there right now, right?

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.160
Or USB, right?

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.160
Hell, if you...

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.160
It's got USB connections.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.160
Yeah, it does have USB.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.520
Hell, if you even wanted to get crazy with it, you could have something that plugs into

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.240
like the memory card slots and the controller ports or something, and it just expands on

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.480
the top where the GameCube stuff is, plugs in that, and has additional storage.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.480
I don't know.

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.480
Whatever.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.480
They can get crazy.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.480
It'd probably be USB.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.480
That would be the change.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.480
I'm kind of irritated because they have all these hard drives that run on USB now, right?

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.960
I mean, like, I think I saw one at Target the other day.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:37.120
Yeah, yeah, Jamie has one, but I've seen, now they even have new ones that are 500 gigabytes.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.040
Five hundred gigabyte USB drive.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040
Mine's 500 gigabytes.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.040
Is it really?

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040
I thought you said it had like a 300 or something.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.040
I paid 120 for it.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.040
Oh, my God.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.040
Oh, my gosh.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:49.240
500 gigabytes for one of those things, and I can't, it's USB, but I can't hook it up

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:53.320
to my Wii, or I can't hook it up to my 360, and I can't, I mean, because of...

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.000
Because you know they're going to want you to use anything with their name on it so they

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.440
can market it and make money on it.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.600
And I'm just saying that sucks.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.080
Because seriously, what else am I going to fill up the 500 gigabytes with besides lots

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.200
of pornography, lots and lots of pornography?

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.200
They're going to find a way.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.200
They're going to find a way.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.200
Lots and lots.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.200
I don't know.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.240
It's quite a few Xbox 360 games quite easily.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:15.240
In theory.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.760
Next story, please.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:21.960
Well, Mad Cats has decided that they're going to give their support to the National Breast

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:32.880
Cancer Foundation and release a pink tech pack for the DS Lite.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:39.080
It will have accessories that have like a carry case, a power adapter for your car,

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:46.440
USB charge cable, two game cases, and two of the stylus pens.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.720
So that's pretty cool.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:54.200
And there's going to be a percentage from the purchase of this that's going to go toward,

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:58.160
you know, like I said, the National Breast Cancer Foundation and retail for $19.99.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:02.040
Well, good for gaming and fundraising colliding.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.040
That's a good thing.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.280
Going back to the previous story in our chat room, chat.ownerswansradio.com, Rama is pointing

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.840
out you can get a one terabyte, that's 1,000 gigabytes, drive for $399.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.480
And Sephiroth1215 says, yeah, I know someone who has a one terabyte drive.

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:18.440
What do you put on that?

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.960
I mean, that's a lot of porn.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.960
That's a lot.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:23.680
That's like a week's worth of porn.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.680
That's what I was looking to buy was a terabyte.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.320
They sell them at Fry's.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.320
HD porn, even.

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:33.000
Do you know how much HD porn you could fit on a terabyte drive?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
That's a lot.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.720
The terabyte drives are something like 300 to 400 bucks, but iOmega makes one.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.040
That's 300 to 400 hours of porn.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040
That's amazing.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.120
Problem is, though, downloading that amount of porn, it would take lots of time.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.120
That's true.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.520
Well, the whole reason I bought mine was because, and now that it's happened, you know, like

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:58.080
I saw it coming, my PC was dying, so I bought my hard drive to save all my crap.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.620
Zappy24 in chat says, a terabyte isn't as much as it seems.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.840
It fills fast.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.440
So you know who's been downloading the HD porn.

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:06.440
Just teasing.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.440
Just teasing.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:12.900
Actually, what was taking up most of mine was, I was, I have entire seasons of Doctor

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:18.420
Who and Stargate, because, you know, I don't watch TV.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:25.400
Which is borderline porn for you, because every time you see David Tennant, like, you

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.000
get a fem boner or whatever they're called.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Fan-gasm.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Sure, a fan-gasm.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Fan-gasm.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Okay.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
A girl boner.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.440
A girl boner.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.880
So one thing that really shouldn't collide, but for some reason this year has been colliding

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:44.200
more than I would like, would be baby raising sims for the DS.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.220
And yet another one has come along, Crave Entertainment's Baby Pals, which should be

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:55.360
coming out in November, if I remember correctly, is a baby washing, dressing, and patty caking

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.360
sim.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.320
It's basically Nintendogs with babies.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:05.600
You have to adopt a pet human, then feed it, bathe it, dress it in funny clothes.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:13.200
You can even teach it to walk, talk, though if you do, was that the first thing?

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:17.160
This is also from another article here, their comment was, though if you get them to do

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:22.100
these things, they're probably saying, why the hell am I wearing these funny clothes?

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:26.680
One thing though they're asking in this article, which is kind of funny, is, so if you ignore

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.520
your Nintendogs, they run away and stuff.

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.760
The babies run away.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:35.960
A baby's hitchhiking to Texas.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:43.440
If you ignore your baby, does virtual social services rep come and take them away?

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.240
If you ignore your baby, then Child Protective Services comes and takes your baby away?

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.240
That was their joke.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.520
I don't think that's actually what's going to happen.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.520
Oh my God, I wish.

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.040
How would that be any different than the reality for some people?

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.920
I was going to say, if you're Britney Spears, you might be able to benefit from this game.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:03.960
I love the picture they have on this, this Wired blog thing, it says, baby spotted you.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.960
It's creepy looking.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:10.480
But yeah, baby pals will be coming out for the DS in November, in a big block of stuff

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.140
that they have, like all the Pet Series and Sim Raising shit.

01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:18.000
So there's Imagine Babies and Baby Pals so far, and I'm pretty sure there's going to

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
be another one.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.500
Now, Loki, I know you've said you and the wife are thinking about having a baby in the

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.160
not too distant future, right?

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.880
So are you going to use this game as like a training?

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.880
Is this something maybe you can...

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.960
I should make her play this.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.680
You should buy it for Nellie, because I don't know where you're at on that one and have

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.720
a baby thing.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:38.960
But if maybe you want to hold off a little bit, I say buy this game for Nellie and make

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.280
sure that Child Protective Services doesn't take her Nintendbaby away.

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.240
I just want to buy this.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.880
To me, this game poses the challenge of the Sims.

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.680
The Sims, you're supposed to make the family thrive and yadda, yadda, yadda, but all I

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.200
want to do in the Sims is try to kill them.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:03.200
So in Baby Pals, it's like, how can I possibly abuse these Sim babies?

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:08.760
I mean, just like in Nintendogs, you can kind of like, I don't know, throw the Frisbee at

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.880
their head and stuff.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.880
It'd be fun.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:18.040
Kiki just recently had a baby, apparently, and is saying, uh-huh, oh, she's born and

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.520
sitting on my lap listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.520
Be careful.

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.700
That could be minus points for the baby.

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:29.200
That may be one step closer to CPS coming down, no, I'm just kidding.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.600
Congratulations though, seriously.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:32.760
New babies are fun.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.080
When they're real babies, they're good things.

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.800
When they're Sim babies, they're stupid.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.440
I have to say, I've met a good baby.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.440
Yeah.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.320
My friend Becky, her baby, quiet.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320
Well-behaved.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:53.720
Yeah, Brihoma says the baby's going to ask, Mommy, what's a girl boner?

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:54.720
Wow.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.720
Oh, cool, Deakman.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:02.760
Oh, it's Deakman, okay, it's Deakman's partner.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.400
Kiki's my girlfriend and that's my baby.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.400
Oh, okay.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.680
Oh, the whole family's listening to OLR together.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.960
That's so- One, two, three, aww.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.960
Wow.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.720
Message to the baby, stop crying so much.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.900
Mommy and Daddy value their sleep.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:21.900
Just kidding.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.840
All right, let's move on with some news.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:28.600
Moving on to a completely different field here, MMOs.

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:31.440
You know, people love their MMOs.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.800
The World of Warcraft is still dominating as always, but there's some other MMOs you

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.880
may not have heard about.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:45.480
RF Online is creating an MMO and the MMO is called- I'm sorry, RF Online is the game.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.160
It's actually being made by Codemasters.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.900
RF Online is now a free game.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:58.240
The game came out back in 2006, didn't really get noticed by a lot of people, but the game

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:03.880
is now completely free to download and play, no monthly subscription, and there is actually

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.160
a new content update with the game.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:12.800
It's episode two, Pioneers of Novus, so they made the game completely free.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.360
If you want to check this game out, I don't know, look at the screenshot, it looks a little

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:21.120
bit like Phantasy Star-ish to me because it looks like it's the real-time fighting, but

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:25.640
I couldn't tell you because I haven't played the game myself yet, but now that it's free,

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:28.300
I might just have the incentive to do that.

01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:33.400
So check that out, it's RF-OnlineGame.com if you want more information.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:39.080
Well, I have a little bit of information that will make lots and lots of people happy.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.400
It makes me happy.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:45.640
Nights has a date.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:51.880
December 18th is going to be the release date for Night's Journey of Dreams, and in the

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:56.760
UK, well, actually it just says Europe in general, will be January is when the release

01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:01.040
is, though there's not a specific date.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:05.260
So sorry, Nights fans, but no Christmas for you overseas.

01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:08.320
Did you watch the demo play for Nights?

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:11.080
I saw some screens, but I didn't watch the demo.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.960
It's very, very, very cool.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.440
I know you're a big fan of Nights.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.560
Are you the one that told me Christmas Nights is one of your favorite games ever?

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.520
Well, we have a tradition in my house around Christmas, we break out the Saturn, make sure

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.120
the battery works.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.040
Yeah, I lost all of my Symphony of the Night data.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.480
I bet you were happy.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:33.000
After I maxed out everything you can with Maria.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.720
I bet you were very happy with that.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:35.720
Oh, no.

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:40.880
But we play Christmas Nights every year, and we break out the Saturn in December, and we

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.360
play all the way through the dates, and the closer you get to Christmas, I think it's

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:51.000
really cool that certain, they change textures in it, they change the music, it starts snowing,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.600
you get snow effects on the ground the closer you get to Christmas Day, and it's really

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.600
cool.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.600
All right.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.600
Well, maybe they'll do something like that with this.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.600
And presents.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.600
Maybe they'll do that here.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.600
You can play memory.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.600
All right.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.600
Anyhow.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.240
Anyways, so something really cool is actually kind of going on here.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:13.720
The folks over at Ain't It Cool News are putting together a reunion screening for what they

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:19.400
call the greatest video game related yet not a video game based film of all time.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.300
And of course that film is The Wizard.

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:29.640
It is going to be shown at Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas on December 7th.

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:32.580
Tickets go on sale on November 5th.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:40.300
And are available on the Alamo Drafthouse's website or www.drafthouse.com.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:44.600
If you're in the area and want to go to the screen, be sure to pick up a ticket.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:50.520
In attendance will be, let's see here, Fred Savage, director Todd Holland.

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.840
Wow.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.760
And let's see, Luke Edwards also will be there.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.840
And apparently the guy that played Lucas will not be there.

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:06.960
I love the Power Glove.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.960
It's so bad.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:16.080
Yeah, well, just keep your Power Gloves off her, pal, huh?

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.760
Why is it that America loves The Wizard?

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.800
He grew up cute.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:21.800
Fred Savage?

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:22.800
Yeah.

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.040
Didn't you see he was in the doctor...

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.320
He still has the same face.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:27.880
He was in the Austin Powers movie as the mole.

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:34.640
He had a sitcom on NBC a while ago, too, so anyway.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:39.040
What is it about The Wizard that people still love to this day?

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.600
It's just The Wizard.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:45.840
I think it has a very Rocky Horror-ish element to it with the video game crowd, because of

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:48.840
course, those that know me know that I still love me some Rocky Horror Picture Show, and

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:52.600
part of that is because the whole crowd gets into it and has fun with it.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:55.940
And I think that's kind of where The Wizard is headed, not that I'm saying people are

01:17:55.940 --> 01:18:00.200
going to dress up and act out the thing, although they might, I mean, I don't know.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:05.000
But I could imagine that when this scene comes up in the movie, people are going to start

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.600
cheering and they're going to yell back, and all the girls are going to scream at that,

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.040
oh, he touched my breast part, and all that stuff.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.440
It just has that campiness to it that's very fun.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:20.200
But I'm glad to hear that Fred Savage is going and has a good sense of humor about it.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:24.040
I wish they were doing this in more places than just Austin.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:29.040
If they can do midnight showings of Showgirls, surely they could put The Wizard in San Francisco

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.040
for one night and people would come out.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.040
Could you imagine having a shadow cast for The Wizard?

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:35.480
I don't even want to think about it.

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.640
There's other movies I'd rather see that done to.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:43.960
Tiger Claw says, people love The Wizard because it's filled with so much Nintendo propaganda.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:48.240
Rama in chat says, The Wizard ranks right up there with UHF, it's a cult classic.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:51.920
UHF is what I was proposed to over.

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.280
Rama said also, it's a cult classic.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:58.440
It's when they revealed Super Mario Brothers 3, and I think a lot of us remember that from

01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.440
our childhood.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.880
Like, a lot of us went to go see the movie just to freakin' see Mario 3.

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:04.880
Me too.

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.880
Wow.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.880
That's hardcore.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.840
I'm providing a shopping service for our listeners in the chat room.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:10.840
What shopping service?

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:14.080
Yeah, people saying, I want a Saturn, and I was like, you want a Saturn?

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.880
You can buy one off eBay.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.600
Use your hard-earned money to buy something off eBay right now.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.600
I have two Saturns.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.080
If you want something bad enough, you'll make it happen.

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:27.520
I have a Saturn that I'm willing to get rid of because it has no controllers and no cords

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.520
or anything.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.520
I'll take it.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.520
I've got a bajillion controllers and cords.

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.520
Wow.

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.720
That'll be three Saturns in my house.

01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:34.720
I need a Saturn.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.720
I've never, I've barely played any Saturn games in my life.

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:39.200
That's what I need to play on a Saturn.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.200
I think I have that.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:41.200
The stall is awesome.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:44.520
Do you want to just borrow an extra set of controllers and cords for me?

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.760
Well, I have, I have, my first Saturn has all the stuff for it.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.760
Oh.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:49.760
You don't have the second one.

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.760
Yeah.

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:54.160
Because I went to Denio's, you know, local flea market over here, and the first one I

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.840
saw was the Saturn without anything because the guy was selling it for like 20 bucks.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.160
I'm like, okay, I'll take it.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.160
You went to Trader Dan's, right?

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:04.960
I don't remember, but then I went somewhere else and I found a Saturn with everything.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.960
I'm like, okay, well, I'll just have a spare one, get parts or something.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:08.960
Yeah.

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.520
Of course, you have to replace your battery every month.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.520
Wow.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:17.760
Well, now we're getting all nostalgic, and what better time than to bring out Dark Sakura's

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.520
classic game of the week.

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.520
Yes, that's right.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:24.320
Part A is coming to an end, and this is the part of the show where we like to let Dark

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:29.040
Sakura reminisce a little bit about games you may have missed, and I honestly think

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.160
damn near everyone missed this game Dark Sakura's going to do this week.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.720
I'm kind of excited to hear a little more about it, so I will stop the suspense, cue

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:41.480
the music, and let Dark Sakura take it away.

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:53.200
Today's classic game slash obscure slash whatever game I pick of the week is Magical Fantasy

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.800
Adventure Popful Mail.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.080
Wow, that's a mouthful.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.080
Yeah.

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:09.120
It was released originally on the PC-98 and PC-88 system in Japan, and it's sort of like

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:14.080
Ys, you side scroll adventure, it has RPG elements, you can change out your weapons,

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:20.320
you can change out your items, and talk to people, and all the stuff.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:27.080
It was released in Japan afterwards on Super Famicom, on PC Engine CD, and on the Mega

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:32.120
CD, and over here we actually got the Sega CD version thanks to working delays, I mean

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.400
working designs.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:41.240
Working designs are also the lovely people that brought Silhouette Mirage, the Grow Lancer

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:48.720
series, Lunar, they were very, very good to us.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:54.320
So in this game you were playing a little busty elven girl called Popful, no, called

01:21:54.320 --> 01:22:04.400
Mail, and you play as her friends, and you go around trying to, you know, save things,

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:08.600
her friend the sorcerer Tat, and the little dragon guy named Gal, and you fight bad guys

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.480
called Nutscracker and Muttonhead.

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.480
There's a guy named Nutscracker?

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.480
Nutscracker.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.640
I don't know if I like this guy.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.440
And it's a pretty cool game.

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:24.000
Who's this that Mail's talking to right now in our little clip we're playing in the background?

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:29.000
This is like the very start of the game, someone who's just cutting it out.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.960
Say, why don't you take me with you, I bet you have lots of adventures, why else would

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:34.960
you have such a huge soul?

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.440
I love the huge anime eyes and smile.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.440
Excuse me?

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.040
I'm so hungry, I can eat an okra.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:44.520
I think you're confused, I'm a bounty hunter, not a baby cheer bub.

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:50.240
Well the old CD games never had good music with them, or I mean good voice acting music

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.240
was really good.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:55.080
Actually the voice acting wasn't really too bad, they at least tried.

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:59.240
The problem I had with working designs is that they would put stuff into the game that

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:04.520
just was not there and usually kind of crass humor, like with Rayearth.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:10.000
Now they actually made improvements when they brought out Rayearth on Saturn, but they took

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:16.000
out the fact that they speak dialogue every time you touch an item, which cut down on

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.360
the, it had intense loading time on the game.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:27.920
But they put in all these jokes like there was one about Harry Palms, but this was a

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.920
fun game, it was a lot of fun.

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:40.720
And it had the classic cut scenes and it's just very mid 90s game fun, that's all I can

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:41.720
say it is.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:46.720
And I actually was surprised with my copy because I had played it back in the day when

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:51.000
a friend of mine had imported it.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.500
And then it got its US release and I never, I didn't have a Sega CD at the time so I never

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:57.000
actually got it.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.340
And one day Dan came home with this huge box for me to open at Christmas and inside this

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:08.880
huge box, it was supposed to be like a space heater, was my game at the bottom of the box.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.880
How funny.

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:12.320
I actually own an original Popple meal now.

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.320
Awesome.

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.960
Well that's a good game of the week because I bet a lot of people miss that one, but some

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:18.720
folks in chat seem to recognize it and applaud that pick of the week.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.100
Popple meal is your classic game of the week.

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:26.400
And with that part A comes to a close, but fear not, we'll be back in just a little bit

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.440
with part B. So stay tuned and thanks for downloading Orange Lounge Radio.
