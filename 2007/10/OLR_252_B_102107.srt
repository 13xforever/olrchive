Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,500
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, October the 21st, 2007.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,500
And of course, Orange Lounge Radio does tape live on Sunday nights

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
and releases the live show in two parts, part A and B.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And you're listening to part B right now, which means we've already taken care of the formalities.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So let's get back to the gaming news.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So anyways, something we've been talking about for the last few weeks here is the Xbox 360 arcade SKU.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It doesn't exist, but it actually does.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Apparently, there has been some interesting proof for this, including someone actually buying one.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So, I mean, duh.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But, yeah, it is basically, you know, a core system now with a wireless controller.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It does have HDMI on it.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It will feature a 256 megabyte memory unit and a disk including five Xbox Live Arcade trial games, apparently.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,500
Boom Boom Rocket, Feeding Frenzy, Luxor 2, and Pac-Man Championship and Uno.

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
That's fucking lame.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They're only trial games?

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That does seem a little weird.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Has that been confirmed that they're actually just the trial games?

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That kind of sucks a lot.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It says, let's see here, plus five trial games.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Box lists five games and it says plus five trial games.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, oh, you get the console, the peripherals, plus these five trial games,

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
or you get the five full Xbox Liveware games plus five totally separate games.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't know, they didn't really say what it's on there, but...

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, maybe if Microsoft will actually acknowledge the existence of this, then...

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Can't we tell you this much, okay?

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Not supposed to say anything, but it's going to be fucking announced on the 23rd, officially,

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
because that's the day it comes out.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, that's fine. This podcast won't hit till the 23rd for most people, so...

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, it's coming out. It will be officially announced on the 23rd.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know why, even after all this stuff, that they're still insisting on keeping it a fucking secret.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I mean, when people are leaking it out there, it's been purchased, it's been out there,

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
why they're still denying it's coming out, but they have a whole marketing plan behind it,

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
how they're going to promote it and stuff.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So, it will be officially announced on the 23rd.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What's so special about the 23rd?

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's whenever they're fucking... It's when this is coming out. I don't know why.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's so special about it?

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Does it line up with an expo or something?

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, it's just whenever they feel like it.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Interesting.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And, I guess, I think also at the same time, that's when the elite bundle that they're doing for the holidays is coming out as well.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, that's pretty much it.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah. So, not a huge surprise.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It was totally not coming out or anything.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well, back to the rumor camp.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And, you know, most Microsoft rumors do end up being true.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So, this could be something that does come to light.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Although, I don't know. This is a little bit far-fetched for me.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I forgot to mention, sorry, real quick.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes. No, that's all right.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It was confirmed by Microsoft.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They did confirm that it is coming.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
They just never said anything else beyond that.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But, they're like, you just need to wait for details.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They're like, arcade for us is the ability to bring in a new set of audiences.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
They're probably a little bit more casually focused.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And, they're looking for a new family experience and more price focused.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Robbie Bach told Financial Times, marking Microsoft's first public comments about the new SKU.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Of course, they didn't really say what was included with it or any of the details and stuff.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But, like I said, 23rd, all this will be finally officially announced and our Microsoft rep can finally calm down a little bit.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, this will be something that could bring people in.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And, that is combining the HD DVD player and the Xbox 360.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
A lot of us have kind of wondered, why hasn't this been done already?

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Well, there are rumors going around that Toshiba is actually teaming up with Microsoft to be making an actual HD DVD slash Xbox 360.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And, when I hear this, my mind kind of goes to, you remember the Panasonic Q, I think it was called, that was the GameCube slash DVD player that you could only get in Japan?

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Right, is that what it was called, Jamie?

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Didn't we see one of those once when we went to one of those import gaming stores, the Panasonic device that played the GameCube games?

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I believe so.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hmm, so.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Anyhow, Toshiba seems to be making something like that, I'm assuming, that combines HD DVD and Xbox 360.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The device supposedly will include an HD DVD player.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It is 1080p with HDMI, wireless networking, dual HD tuners with a program guide, an MP3 player dock, and possibly also a 40-inch TV to come with it or sold separately that will dock the actual 360.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Here's a funny thought.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Interesting.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Because I remember way back when they were talking about TVs that would have the original Xbox integrated into them as something like this.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How much do you want to bet this isn't actually a 360, it's a Toshiba HD DVD player that will also play Xbox 360 games?

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's kind of what the Panasonic Q was, right?

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It was just a DVD player that would also play GameCube games.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It was kind of cool.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Sort of, yeah.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So anyway, here's why folks are getting all speculative about this.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Apparently an unnamed or unknown Toshiba rep actually said, an Xbox with a built-in DVD drive is critical.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They and we are working on it.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It also has to be more than a gaming machine.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Microsoft recognizes this.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
A version of the device may also be sold under the Toshiba brand name.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hmm.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hmm.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That would make sense.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I mean, didn't we have a bajillion different versions of the CDI?

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I suppose.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The 3DO, I'm sorry.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It is kind of interesting because I don't think we've seen anything really like this since the Panasonic Q.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And even then the Panasonic Q wasn't even sold here.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And here's the thing, too, about that.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That way if it is branded under the Toshiba name, when you have the Sony guy saying, hey, look at this.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
See, this 360 is like $800 or something and it comes with all this stuff.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, you can get the PlayStation 3 and it does just as well.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, they can say, well, it's actually not an Xbox 360.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It just happens to play Xbox 360 games.

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You know, kind of spin it that way, I guess.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But that's neat, I guess.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hmm.

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's hope the HD DVD ends up winning out because otherwise that's going to be a big pile of useless crap.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, at least there's quite a few movies already available, including Heroes Season 1, which I still need to buy on HD DVD.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't really care about HD DVD at all, though.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I have a Blu-ray player.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
All right, lady.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So in other HD DVD news, you are also going to be given five free movies if you buy the Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You can choose from Serenity, which is like the best movie ever, The Chronicles of Riddick, Hulk, Children of Men, The Fast and the Furious, Tokyo Drift, Troy, Full Metal Jacket, yeah, Corpse Bride, The Prestige, Swordfish, Black Rain, Dream Girls, and World Trade Center.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The way you claim this is you fill out a form, send in a copy of your barcode, and Microsoft will send you your stuff within 28 days.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Hey, wait, what if I bought mine like six months ago? Can I still cut out the barcode?

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Damn it.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You have to have a receipt.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Jerks.

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Approve purchase.

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Just for our friends in the UK, the add-on is 115 pounds.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And this is just starting in the UK right now.

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They've been having something similar in the US since August.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Still doesn't do me any good.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's old, though. It will run until the end of January.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I was an early adopter.

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hey, Serenity.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I can understand how the iPhone folks feel.

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's true. Serenity is actually a movie I still need to get on HD DVD. I somehow don't have it yet.

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's kind of funny that you mentioned Heroes earlier because I believe that Best Buy is doing a thing right now where you can get a HD DVD add-on for the 360 and get a free copy of the Heroes HD DVD set, including also those five extra DVDs that you can mail away for.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Well, I just missed out on everything, didn't I?

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Boy, early adopters really get screwed over sometimes.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah, definitely.

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Anyways, so other fun stuff to talk about here, including some download content that's going to be coming available.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, it is available right now in Japan for Beautiful Katamari.

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And it's four different little pieces of download content, each 200 Microsoft points.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And they're four different levels, including the Milky Way Consolations, the Weaver Girl, Shopping Spree, and High-Calorie Katamari.

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And basically what these are, the Milky Way Consolation has you roll up 88 constellations to create a new Milky Way.

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The Weaver Girl, you roll up a huge ball of yarn and string to create Vega, the Weaver Girl.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And Shopping Spree, make a space station but be thrifty about it.

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I guess it sounds like an offshoot of a Katamari mission from one of the previous games where the value of items are collected and taken into account.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And High-Calorie Katamari, feed Cetus the Whale, roll up lots of food.

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And that reminds me a little bit of the one from We Love Katamari where he rolled a sumo wrestler around East.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh yeah, that was cool.

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So those are available right now in Asia and Japan, no word on the U.S. yet.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But I'm sure that they'll be coming soon.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Now I didn't mention this during my gaming week earlier in the show, but I did finally when I went out and bought the new microphone for the studio today.

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I went out and bought a beautiful Katamari and played it for about five minutes.

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So I'm not ready to give the game a full review yet.

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Although I have heard a lot of folks have been saying it's awfully short, but we'll see.

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But I just wanted to go and say, you know, despite all the controversy between us and that game, let it be known that OLR knows how to forgive.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I went out and bought the game anyway.

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So when you look up forgiveness in the dictionary and see our picture next to it, you'll understand why.

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh don't worry, I know how to forgive.

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I went out and got the game as well.

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
All right, I'm sure you did.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
All right.

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know if we'll be able to forgive the makers of this game though if it stinks and really devalues the value of the incredible series and miniseries behind it.

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Of course I'm talking about Battlestar Galactica.

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The game is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Well you already knew that, that the game was coming and that you can play as Cylons, you can play as humans.

168
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What you may not know is that the game is coming out this week, that's right, probably by the time most of you are hearing this podcast.

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This game will be up on Xbox Live ready to download.

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
They're calling it a 3D space shooter played on a 2D plane.

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, it sounds a lot like Wing Commander Arena.

172
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And if I remember correctly, I think it's made by the same people too.

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Great track record with that game.

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We'll see. Just in time for the premiere of RZR, Battlestar Galactica RZR, of course the little miniseries about the Pegasus will be debuting November 24th.

175
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, by the way, for those folks that are asking how much the game will cost, such as JAP28 is asking in our chat room,

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,000
$20 on Xbox, I'm sorry, no, scratch that, $20 on the PC, 800 Microsoft Points or $10 on Xbox Live Arcade.

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can get it a day earlier on PCs, October 23rd, $20, not too shabby.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Joy. This is a little bit of joy, even though I'm probably not going to bother buying the game.

179
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Sega Superstar Tennis is going to have, of course, a bunch of different Sega characters in it.

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You have Sonic, you have Amigo from Samba de Amigo, which I think is pretty cool.

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Ooh La La. It's being worked on by Sumo Digital. I'm not seeing anything else about who else is going to be in it,

182
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
or a date for that matter, but we do have it on PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Nintendo DS.

183
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Please tell me that every time Ooh La La hits the ball, she'll go choo, choo, choo.

184
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That would be good.

185
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
For those of you who play Space Channel 5, that's funny.

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I do like what they mentioned on Kotaku, that they want to see characters from House of the Dead and Altered Beast. That'd be cool.

187
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That would be kind of rad.

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I want to play as a zombie. That'd just be awesome.

189
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And then, like, when you win, you eat the other person?

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Amazing Zombie Tennis, the game. That would be kind of fun.

191
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We'll see. Are you listening, Sega? Make it happen.

192
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't think that's going to happen.

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't think so either, but it's going to be a dream.

194
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Anyways, one thing that is happening, though, and also on the 23rd, will be Guitar Hero music,

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
available for download, at least a digital download,

196
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
including music from Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 2, and Guitar Hero Encore, Rock the 80s.

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It will be available from Wave Group, and I guess affiliated with, you know, other stuff.

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And it will be available, I guess, across such download sites as AOL, iTunes, Napster, Rhapsody, and Yahoo.

199
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Somebody told me there's actually a DDR soundtrack on iTunes now for Supernova 2. I didn't even know that.

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's kind of neat.

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I didn't know either, so.

202
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We used to have our own little playlist uploaded on iTunes that had all the DDR music from the games

203
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
and where they could be found on iTunes, but I didn't bother to maintain it.

204
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think I updated it after last year's wave of games, and now there's just too many songs to keep track of.

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
iTunes has a lot now.

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Anyhow, so I guess you can download that if you want to hear the Guitar Hero versions of songs,

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
which, you know, some of them are pretty good, not too shabby.

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Maybe we'll put some of them on Rotation in our regular 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week program

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
on orange.traded.com with the gaming music.

210
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And hopefully the music won't stop like E for All did when the power...

211
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Somebody forgot to pay the bill at E for All and the power got shut off.

212
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
No, just kidding. That's not the reason why.

213
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But on Friday night at about 7 o'clock, E for All came to a very abrupt end because the lights went out.

214
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
A lot of folks were watching a match between Fatality, he was playing Quake 4,

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and some other folks were playing Super Mario Galaxy and some of the other games that were available there,

216
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and then the power shut off on the whole right half of South Hall,

217
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and that would have been where the Nintendo and the EA booths were,

218
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
which were pretty much the main reasons why people were going to the show right there between those two,

219
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and so they decided to end the show at that point.

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The staff quickly escorted everybody out of the convention hall

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
because when the power goes out, that's actually not safe.

222
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So, safety hazard.

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Money back!

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Refund.

225
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I know, but wasn't the show going to close at like 8 anyway?

226
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know. I don't remember the hours for the show,

227
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
but I seem to recall it was going to close kind of early anyway.

228
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And by the way, this isn't the first time something like this has happened at the convention center.

229
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There have been some previous E3s where similar things have happened,

230
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
but it just kind of sucks that it's happening to E4ALL when they're kind of...

231
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
They've been taking a lot of crap from various game blogs and stuff

232
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
for not being up to the same level that many of us remember with the big E3 expos,

233
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
so this doesn't help them try to get past that.

234
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You know what I mean?

235
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Sorry, E4ALL.

236
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No, you're not.

237
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're just saying that.

238
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Alright, I am.

239
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Okay.

240
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The PS3 is actually seeing an increase in sales in Europe now.

241
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
They have gone up by 178%.

242
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Wow.

243
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But that's with the introduction of the 60GB bundle and the new 40GB unit that came out.

244
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Was there a price drop that just went in there?

245
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, yes, there was a price drop that happened too recently.

246
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yep, there was.

247
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And I'm sure there may be...

248
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
They also were saying that the software sales increased with a Resistance Fall of Man

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
actually taking a rise in its chart status

250
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and Heavenly Sword and Motorstorm.

251
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Those are kind of the must-have PS3 games at this point,

252
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
so not too surprising that folks getting their new PS3s are picking up those games.

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That makes sense to me.

254
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Anyways, oh my God, they totally announced the 40GB system for the US.

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm so shocked.

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I did not realize that that was coming.

257
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Holy crap.

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You're the worst liar ever.

259
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Holy crap.

260
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I know.

261
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So much enthusiasm.

262
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, so Sony finally announced this system.

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They have really done a great job of keeping it under wraps.

264
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
No one knew anything about it.

265
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Apparently, yeah, it's coming out now November 2nd.

266
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It'll officially be $400 US for $399.99, however you want to look at it.

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And, of course, there is no backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 games.

268
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And at the same time, they've also dropped down the 80GB system to $499.99,

269
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
so $100 cheaper.

270
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Awesome.

271
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, one thing that's kind of been pissing people off about these new systems,

272
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
the 40GB system, of course, removes completely the backwards compatibility of the PlayStation 2 games.

273
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You cannot play them.

274
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And the Wall Street Journal actually interviewed Sony Computer Entertainment boss Jack Trenton

275
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
on the whole issue about the backwards compatibility.

276
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And what he said is that this has nothing to do with reducing Sony's cost of manufacturing.

277
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
People would go and speculate that, oh, they had to fit a whole PlayStation 2 in the PlayStation 3,

278
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
so taking that out saves them money.

279
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Nope.

280
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The reason why they did this was, quote,

281
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
encouraging buyers of the entry-level PlayStation 3 to purchase more games designed specifically for the new system.

282
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You are an idiot.

283
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That was horrible.

285
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Lie. Lie to them, people.

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Seriously, don't go, oh, I'm sorry, we took it out just to fuck you over.

287
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So, I mean, you've lied to them.

288
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You say, yes, we did the same cost, and people, oh, okay.

289
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And if they don't want to spend the money, they can go buy the 80-gig system for some more money.

290
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But seriously, you don't go, no, I'm sorry, we really didn't take it out just to save money.

291
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Sure, we saved a little bit of money, but really it was just to fuck you guys over.

292
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I mean, come on.

293
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Who let him talk?

294
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Seriously, who let him talk?

295
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I think Pekor Uno in our chat room would agree with you.

296
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
chat.orangelandstrator.com.

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Pekor Uno says, Sony PR, please shut the fuck up.

298
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Please, please, please.

299
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Come on.

300
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Who let him talk?

301
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's all I want to know.

302
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I mean, you don't, I'm sorry, I try to be as positive as I can with these guys, but they're really making it tough on me.

303
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I mean, seriously.

304
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I thought they just came out the week before and said, okay, well, the reason why is because we removed these chips,

305
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and we removed these chips so that we can cut the price a little bit so that we could drop the price of the system.

306
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay, that makes sense in logic there, but if you're just fucking with us and just removing it because you want to sell some more PlayStation 3 games,

307
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
well, then fuck you.

308
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I mean, seriously.

309
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Interesting thought in our chat room.

310
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Rob Babak says in our chat room, or it could be that Sony wants you to buy backwards compatibility from the PlayStation Network.

311
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh, wouldn't that be mean?

312
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That's really mean if that's true.

313
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But they have said it's software-based. That is definitely plausible.

314
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
No, because it's software-based for the PlayStation 1.

315
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What it was is they had a chip that was running the graphics stuff for the PlayStation 2, but the emotion engine was software-based.

316
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So unless they completely rewrote it to...

317
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But then they get rid of, like in the European ones, didn't they get rid of that and replace it with software?

318
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah, they got rid of one of the two chips, but this 40 gig system has zero of the two chips.

319
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So that's why I can't run anything.

320
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's all fucked up, however you look at it.

321
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I mean, if they're going to make you buy backwards compatibility later on, that's also fucked up.

322
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's just asking for Microsoft to just come back at you with some PR spin on it.

323
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I mean, seriously.

324
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm glad I bought mine when I did.

325
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Some days I want to go just cut your losses and let's hear about PlayStation 4.

326
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It really, I mean...

327
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's getting harder.

328
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm sorry, Sony fanboys, but at the same time, I'm not.

329
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's like, you know, they just don't make...

330
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
They don't make a good case right about now, you know what I mean?

331
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
They just keep shooting themselves in the foot over and over and over.

332
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
There's nothing, I mean, honestly, I'm...

333
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
For the last few weeks, I've been really questioning whether I want to get Ratchet & Clank Future because I haven't paid for it.

334
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm just like, eh, maybe I want something else instead.

335
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I can buy a 360 game with that or something.

336
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's just, I don't know, I've been downloading stuff off the Japanese PlayStation Network.

337
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
They actually have some stuff to download on there.

338
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
On the bright side, maybe the price will drop again before Final Fantasy 13 comes out.

339
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can dream.

340
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You know what?

341
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah, seriously.

342
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
When?

343
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Well, what?

344
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Final Fantasy 13 will probably come out in Japan late next year.

345
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It'll be 2009 at the earliest.

346
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You'll be lucky if it comes out next year.

347
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah, I know.

348
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You'll be lucky.

349
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I know.

350
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Well, that's...

351
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Maybe there will be another price drop before that.

352
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm not holding my breath.

353
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Who knows?

354
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't know.

355
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Me neither.

356
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I got stuff to play on other systems, meanwhile.

357
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's fine.

358
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Well, at least the few things are going to be on PlayStation Network.

359
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
There's Flow and Warhawk.

360
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Flow is spelled with a zero.

361
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's Leet.

362
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Well, it's the way the game is.

363
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah.

364
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It looks very...

365
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It looks kind of electroplanktony.

366
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Are you saying the game is a zero?

367
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
No, I like the game.

368
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I like the game.

369
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's the only game I've bought from PlayStation Network.

370
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Well, these are expansions that are going to be out for there.

371
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The Flow expansion is going to have a multiplayer mode and a new playable creature, and then

372
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,080
Warhawk is going to be another dropship, and you can pick up and relocate ground vehicles.

373
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,000
Multiplayer on Flow could be interesting, even though wasn't Flow more of like an experience

374
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
than a game, so to say?

375
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It puts you to sleep.

376
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It does.

377
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's soothing.

378
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's very soothing.

379
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It looks pretty.

380
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You tilt the controller around and eat shit, and it is a pretty-looking game, but it's

381
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,880
like something that you would see at a rave or something where they're playing chill-out

382
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,080
music and just watching some of the pretty colors and the soothing music.

383
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
It's ambient.

384
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
I don't know.

385
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,280
These minimalist games, though, sometimes are extremely popular.

386
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,960
If you think about it, every Xtreme, which I was talking about earlier, there's one button

387
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
in the game to blow up your ship.

388
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Exactly.

389
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,600
I don't have a problem with that game.

390
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,880
That's why I bought Flow.

391
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
That says a lot.

392
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,960
Because buying stuff off of the PlayStation Network is a bitch, and I don't like doing

393
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,640
it, so Flow is good.

394
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,360
Kiki in our chat room says, screw Flow, get Everyday Shooter, which is a game I've heard

395
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
good things about.

396
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,560
But Everyday Shooter wasn't available when Flow first became available, so, you know.

397
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,600
But yeah, I've thought about buying that game too, because that looks good.

398
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,120
Anyways, another game, as I mentioned earlier, that I tried out, and it is available on the

399
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Japanese PlayStation Network, so if you don't have a Japanese account, create one, download

400
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,700
it, and then you can play it on any of your accounts, but it's Gran Turismo 5 Prologue,

401
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,020
the demo.

402
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,080
So it's a demo for a demo, I guess, or a demo for a demo game that you're going to have

403
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,800
to buy or something like that.

404
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:06,140
Anyways, it features a few cars, I believe there's like, I want to say, like six cars

405
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,820
to choose from or something in the very beginning.

406
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:16,300
And there's going to be single player stuff, no online.

407
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,900
It's a cool looking game, I think there's like one track.

408
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,320
Definitely worth checking out.

409
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,920
Personally, though, when this comes out, I wouldn't buy it.

410
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,060
But hey, if you love Gran Turismo, get your hands on it.

411
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,400
What about the full game when it's released?

412
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,140
I wouldn't buy it.

413
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,440
It's going to be, they're talking $40 for the full game.

414
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,480
Fuck that, I'll wait for the real game to come out and pay like $20 more.

415
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,020
I mean, what's the point?

416
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:47,160
And also, the other thing too is, make sure you download Gran Turismo HD if it's still

417
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,560
available on the PlayStation Network, because I know that they're taking that down soon

418
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,760
when 5 comes out.

419
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
But definitely worth checking it out.

420
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,000
It's a cool looking game, just wouldn't buy it.

421
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
All right.

422
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,400
Well, a very interesting comment coming out of the San Jose Mercury News, Dean Takahashi

423
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,440
is a reporter for the Mercury News and talks often about video games.

424
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,080
And he was writing earlier this week about the latest sales number, and also said this

425
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,740
quote, quote, one piece of news that came out this week was that Sony pleaded with third

426
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,120
party developers not to abandon its struggling platform.

427
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,680
That change in attitude is a marked difference compared to the arrogance of past years.

428
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,360
Very interesting to think that Sony could be on its knees begging people not to leave

429
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
right now.

430
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,680
It kind of makes me go, I wonder who's thinking of jumping ship right now.

431
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Well, it makes sense.

432
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,440
I mean, if you think about it, I mean, look at it.

433
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,480
The system has the least amount of, as far as, I hate calling it next gen, but as far

434
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,320
as the next gen platforms, it has the least market share, at least in the US, and it's

435
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,540
more expensive to develop for and it takes a lot longer to develop for.

436
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,280
Why would you spend the extra money and time to develop a game for the PlayStation 3 when

437
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,480
you can equally do it for the Xbox 360 and be able to sell more units?

438
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,780
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

439
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,400
So I don't know, I'm not surprised.

440
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,280
And I wish they had done it sooner because now they're just pissing people off.

441
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,360
Keep in mind there's some developers out there that have really strongly voiced an opinion

442
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,760
about the PlayStation 3.

443
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,640
One of the folks at Valve said the PlayStation 3 was a waste of everyone's time and could

444
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,840
be indicating why folks are starting to jump ship and Sony's begging people to stay around.

445
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,720
Speaking of which, Half-Life 2, the orange box on PlayStation 3 not coming out until

446
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,440
December now.

447
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,880
And as some folks are speculating, if at all, if you keep getting delay, delay, delay, eventually

448
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,400
you might start seeing cancelled, cancelled, cancelled, I think this holiday season could

449
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
make or break Sony.

450
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,800
I don't want to sound all like finalists here, but if Sony doesn't manage to sell through

451
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,600
a lot of consoles, it's interesting because Extrofer and I, for those who didn't hear

452
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,600
the bonus segment tonight, Extrofer and I drove to Disneyland together and we were talking

453
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
about game stuff.

454
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,440
He works at a large retail chain right now that sells electronics as a part of it and

455
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,960
he says, he's like, I'm not biased, but I'm sitting there and I'm watching, we are selling

456
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:22,800
quite a few Xbox 360, tons of Wii's, I have never, now keep in mind he works overnights,

457
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,360
but he sees these systems go even in the overnight shifts and he says, I have never seen us sell

458
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,000
a PlayStation 3.

459
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,760
Well Walmart's kind of a weird demographic, I mean I don't think people go buy PlayStation

460
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
3's there.

461
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:43,240
The thing, I mean seriously though, I'm just taking it right now as to date, and I was

462
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,600
talking to you about this before the show started because kind of going back to the

463
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,800
whole Eye of Judgment bet that we have right now so far and I was looking at the numbers

464
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:57,200
after the MPD group reported on for September, year to date the PlayStation 3, there's not

465
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,800
been a game that's sold over 400,000 units in the United States, which isn't that great.

466
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,000
I mean when you consider like Halo sold 2 million units and there's a bunch of other

467
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,640
games that have sold millions of units and stuff like that, 300,000 or 335,000 if I remember

468
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:20,120
correctly was for Resistance Fall Man, it's not that good.

469
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,320
And I know people are waiting for Metal Gear Solid 4, which is going to be an awesome game,

470
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,240
you know, and that will be probably a must have game for the PlayStation 3, may help

471
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,840
them sell some units, but I think a lot of people in hope to God that they don't announce

472
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,320
that there's going to be an Xbox 360 version for that around the same time, you know, I

473
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,680
think that may sell some units for them, but at the same time there's not, they're going

474
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:50,260
to lose out this holiday for sure, that's a fact, and by the time that all these good

475
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:56,000
games come around it's going to be too late, that's really what it's going to be, so.

476
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,920
Hope they make it, I mean, because I'd like to see all three consoles doing good, but.

477
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:09,400
I don't know, I don't know, alright, yet again, another Sony debate here on the program, hey

478
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,800
we love to always get your perspective, I'm sure there's some people that feel very differently

479
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,440
about this whole issue, Mailbag at OrangeHonorTrader.com is the place to express your opinion, and

480
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,140
every week here on the program we like to read your emails here on the program and respond

481
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:28,840
to them if appropriate, so DarkSakura likes to read the emails at Mailbag at OrangeHonorTrader.com

482
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,520
in our Mailbag segment.

483
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:41,160
From what I understand this week, not a lot of people expressing their opinions, huh?

484
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
No.

485
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
That's too bad.

486
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,920
Um, first email says, hey I'd really like the new segment and I think it's fun to reminisce

487
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:54,680
on old but great games, I would actually like to request a game to be featured in this segment,

488
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:02,480
Ristar for the Sega Genesis, it's one of my all time favorites, thanks, that's from Osprey.

489
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,960
Maybe one day, I didn't really play it that much.

490
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,520
Well maybe now's the time to start.

491
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,880
I already have a game picked up for next week, although it's really really really obscure.

492
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,720
What happens when you're out in November, does that mean Loki and I get to pick some

493
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,720
games?

494
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Sure.

495
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,240
Actually, I'll go ahead and tell you the one I thought about doing next week that I'm not

496
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,080
going to do was Kaze No Regret, the real sound game that came out on the Saturn that was

497
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,280
sound only and you got a packet of seeds with it.

498
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,360
Are we going to be seeing nothing but Sega games?

499
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
No.

500
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
Alright, good.

501
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,400
I have been doing Sega games lately, haven't I?

502
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,480
Yeah, you have.

503
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,320
You're eating some joke over there, Loki.

504
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,320
What is-

505
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,160
No, I was just thinking of classic games, well, they're not exactly classic games, but

506
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,360
games I was thinking only I would pick-

507
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,360
Gals panic.

508
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Gals panic is good.

509
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
Don't get me wrong.

510
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,360
Okay.

511
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Well, let's not ruin it.

512
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
This week.

513
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
I was going to say like BMX sure blacks.

514
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
Define classic.

515
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
It's classy.

516
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,360
It's a classy game.

517
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
Alright.

518
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,800
Yeah, Dark Soccer is going to be on vacation a couple weeks in November, but we'll cross

519
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,360
that bridge when we get to it.

520
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,320
The last email is, dear OLR, this is a theory that has been floating around the internets

521
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,240
for some time, the third console curse.

522
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,280
Basically, this theory states that every third console by every leading publisher will ultimately

523
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,640
fail or do significantly less better than its predecessor.

524
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
Just think about it.

525
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,920
The Atari 5200 was Atari's third system and it failed.

526
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,920
No, it didn't.

527
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,040
The Sega Saturn was Sega's third home system and it slowly died because producing its motherboard

528
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
was so expensive.

529
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,280
Well, also, they didn't really support it very well in the US.

530
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:42,200
The Nintendo 64 did not fare well due to Sony's more powerful system and CD-based media.

531
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
That's true.

532
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,560
And lastly, Sony and its PlayStation 3, which I need not explain, especially since we just

533
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,920
went over it, although the N64 and Saturn were pretty awesome systems, you can't help

534
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,120
but say they did fail to their rival systems in terms of sales.

535
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,200
I know that this argument has no base whatsoever, but I just wanted to throw this out.

536
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Technically, the Saturn was not the third system.

537
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,400
The Saturn was the Master System, Genesis, Sega CD, 32X, and then the...

538
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,360
Well, 32X, I wouldn't really call a system, is more of an add-on, but still, it's not

539
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,360
the third system.

540
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
Fourth, fifth.

541
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,160
So, yeah, that doesn't really count.

542
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,160
I don't know.

543
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,720
I kind of want to say something controversial.

544
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
I don't know.

545
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,000
I'll tell you why they all failed because they all appeared on the cover of Madden NFL.

546
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,160
That's why they all failed.

547
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,640
No, the controversial thing I want to say, our emailer says the Nintendo 64 was a good

548
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,040
system with the Saturn.

549
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
I disagree.

550
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,600
I don't think the Nintendo 64 was a good system.

551
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
No, it was not.

552
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,240
It was not a good system.

553
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,000
The critical flaw they made in the system was that they refused to go to CD.

554
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,920
That was one decision that fucking killed them.

555
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:02,160
Did developers manage to make great games with a mediocre system?

556
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,560
Yes.

557
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,800
And then you go to the GameCube.

558
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:11,200
The GameCube wasn't a bad system, but the GameCube also made some key mistakes that

559
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,680
I think make the GameCube not so great a system, honestly.

560
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,160
And I know there's Nintendo fanboys that are going to have their pitchfork and torches,

561
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,720
but the Nintendo 64, I think, made some key mistakes, and that was it didn't go online.

562
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,400
It didn't play DVDs, which at the time that it came out, it was really an essential thing

563
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,000
that the competitors had going.

564
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,800
However, I do think the Wii is a great idea and a great system, and it's nice to see Nintendo

565
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
kind of go in a different direction.

566
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,600
But I would argue that Nintendo 64 was not a good system.

567
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,040
You mean the Nintendo GameCube?

568
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Both.

569
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
Yeah.

570
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:49,560
Um, I don't know, it's just, they really, hopefully, you know, with the Wii, I hate

571
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:56,280
going back, you know, go online Nintendo, seriously, go online, and uh...

572
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,200
I'm giving them a chance because I see, they're repeating their cycle of the DS, which worked

573
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
for them.

574
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,080
They're slowly, they're unboxing it slowly.

575
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,280
Online will come into Nintendo in 08.

576
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,880
You already see it starting to happen with Mario Kart and stuff, just like it did on

577
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
the DS.

578
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,840
Mario Kart launched the whole online thing on the DS, so, I mean, do I think they're

579
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
behind?

580
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Yes.

581
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,380
Do I think they're, you know, do I think their system is better than Microsoft?

582
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:30,480
Certainly not, but, um, it's better than nothing, which is pretty much what the GameCube had

583
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
save one game.

584
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,480
Yeah.

585
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
Well, there's more to the email.

586
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
Sorry.

587
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Okay.

588
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
By the way, you guys, you're too self-depreciating.

589
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,320
This show is ten times better than any other podcast I've listened to because your personalities

590
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,260
work so well together.

591
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,000
All the other podcasts just give me the straight news with limited opinions, which meticulously

592
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,320
sidestep criticizing sponsors.

593
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,960
On OLR, I get my news mixed in with a little bit of Dirty Sanchez and Broadway show tunes.

594
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,240
You guys are effin' kickass.

595
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Hee-on.

596
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,520
Aw, we didn't have any PlayStation 3 show tunes tonight amongst all those Sony news.

597
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Maybe next week.

598
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
We'll see.

599
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,280
No, I know, but the, remember the week we had the Sony was marketing with show tunes?

600
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,160
Was this last week or two weeks ago?

601
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,160
Anyway.

602
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
Ah, forget it.

603
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,160
Thank you.

604
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Oh, and someone sent us spam too.

605
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
We don't care though.

606
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
Hooray.

607
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,160
We don't like spam.

608
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,800
Um, thanks.

609
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Appreciate the email.

610
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that we've just been doing this so long, we've almost

611
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,260
become jaded to an extent, but in a good way, you know, we're honest.

612
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,480
We've been doing this underground for a long time.

613
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,480
News don't, we have to beg people to come on our show.

614
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,480
People don't come knockin' on our door like they do for the big box sites that have magazines

615
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,840
and all that things attached to them.

616
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,720
And honestly, I think that's what our listeners enjoy.

617
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,080
The fact that we're pretty much just like you, only we have microphones.

618
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,720
I guess that's pretty much it.

619
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,600
So anyhow, let's move on.

620
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Shall we?

621
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
Back to the news.

622
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,680
Mailbagorangeontrader.com.

623
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
Send more emails.

624
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,000
Two emails all week?

625
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,120
That's sad, folks.

626
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,760
You make me sad.

627
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:07,920
You know what's sad is that people think that an Xbox 360 game with more achievements equals

628
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,320
better reviews and more sales.

629
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,840
I don't understand, I don't know, but according to Electronic Entertainment Designer Research,

630
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:22,840
they suggest that Xbox 360 achievement systems, called accomplishments, I guess in the report,

631
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,120
had an effect on the title's success.

632
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,280
According to the press release, there is a strong connection between a game's title's

633
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:36,560
diversity of accomplishment types and what the game's profitability was.

634
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,600
I don't buy that one bit.

635
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,800
I mean, it doesn't mean anything, to me at least.

636
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
I don't see why...

637
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,560
You don't think the achievement whores have enough of the market share that...

638
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,040
I think achievement points get people to buy games that they would not necessarily buy.

639
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,720
I know, for example, I bought Xbox Live Arcade games thinking, oh, hey, I can get some pretty

640
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,840
easy achievements off there, and I would buy them and then find out, yeah, they suck and

641
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,680
those achievements are a lot harder to get.

642
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,080
I don't think that, if anything, I would think that the less achievements a game has, the

643
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,840
better it'll sell, well, for achievement whores at least, because if there's one achievement

644
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,960
to give me 1,000 points or something, all I do is beat the game.

645
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:26,480
But a lot of the true achievement whores use Gamefly or one of those rental services anyway.

646
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Rent the game, get the points, send it back.

647
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,480
Exactly.

648
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,940
I think it's just a coincidence, and I think that's just a trend that a lot of games are

649
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,940
coming out and have more achievements, but I don't know.

650
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,760
It's cool that achievements are in there, but I don't think it really has anything to

651
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,640
do with the way games sell.

652
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,840
I don't hear reviews talking about achievements.

653
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:55,640
All right, well, this game will not have any achievements, sadly, because it's not on an

654
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
Xbox platform.

655
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,800
It's SingStar, which is Sony's answer, of course, to Karaoke Revolution.

656
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,760
There's a new version of SingStar that might surprise you.

657
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,560
It's only coming out in Europe.

658
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:12,040
It's not coming out over here, but it's SingStar Bollywood is coming out on Friday in Europe.

659
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,560
Actually, I'm sorry, that was last Friday, so it's already out in Europe.

660
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,720
Now, you don't have to learn a whole new language, even though the Bollywood songs, of course,

661
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,240
I'm referring to when I say Bollywood.

662
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,400
I'm talking about cinema from India, which they like to burst.

663
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,440
Even in the action movies, they'll burst out into song.

664
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,960
And I'm talking like, you want to talk about Sony and freaking show tunes?

665
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,200
This is the game with it, because you get show tunes in all those Indian movies, and

666
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,600
they're really over the top, real fun stuff and catchy stuff.

667
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
We were watching the Bollywood Awards last night.

668
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,160
Yeah, I was just going to say, yeah, we went to Indian food today, actually, for lunch.

669
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,960
We had a little Jamie Robb brunch at the Indian food place, and they were watching some award,

670
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
and they were doing some of the musicals.

671
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
I got that guy's name.

672
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
And some of it's catchy.

673
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,240
I got that guy's name.

674
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,240
What is it?

675
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
I'm glad that you got to see that performance.

676
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Akshay Kumar?

677
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,680
Sadly, he is not in this game.

678
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,400
That's sad, because that was a freaking good performance.

679
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,400
All right.

680
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
But that would be cool.

681
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,480
See, I would get that if we would get a release over here.

682
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,400
Well, who knows?

683
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,720
Write some emails, make some demands.

684
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,240
You never know what might happen.

685
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,680
Anyhow, the full song list is floating around out there, but I do notice certain artists

686
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,520
are repeated several times in the game.

687
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
So check that out.

688
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
Like Calho Naho is...

689
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,080
I think those are the actual movies and not the artists.

690
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,760
Oh, that one makes sense.

691
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
I got you.

692
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,640
Oh, so these are the productions, okay.

693
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,920
So there's quite a few there from Calho Naho, that movie.

694
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,560
A song called Pretty Woman, but I don't think it's the same one most people over on this

695
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,800
side of the ocean would think of when they think of that song, Pretty Woman.

696
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,720
Mark Tetsuya in chat room says, we need to import this game for Loki.

697
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,080
I don't know, Loki.

698
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Feel like singing some Bollywood?

699
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
I don't feel like singing anything.

700
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:56,240
Yeah, I'm actually posting that website to the chat room, because my impromptu website

701
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
of the week.

702
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
All right.

703
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,240
It lives.

704
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:09,400
So, at any rate, in other news, there is still going to be a Golden Axe update.

705
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:15,960
It will be Golden Axe Beast Rider, which is exclusive for Xbox 360.

706
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:24,360
And they are talking about them going to be a PS3 version, but it may not be the same

707
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
one.

708
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,200
But it's supposed to be a Golden Axe RPG.

709
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,920
I heard that both of those games are coming out in the spring of next year, I think February

710
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
or March.

711
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,440
Well, that makes happy, because I like Golden Axe.

712
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:42,720
But I didn't see the Beast Rider thing on there or anything like that, but who knows.

713
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,000
That's kind of cool, at least.

714
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,560
Anywho, so let's see here.

715
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,960
There's some other interesting stuff that was floating around the web this week, including

716
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:00,080
a mod for the PC version of Half-Life 2, which includes the portal gun from, of course, Portal.

717
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,480
And looks pretty awesome.

718
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,440
Of course, you know, all the fun things you would imagine you could do with a portal gun,

719
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,360
including throwing grenades through it and whatnot.

720
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:16,240
But who knows, maybe we'll see some multiplayer mods for Portal as well.

721
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,880
Or maybe an official release.

722
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,880
Yeah.

723
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,440
Lots of love in our chat room, by the way.

724
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,980
I noticed before the show started tonight, we had a lot of people in chat just spilling

725
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,920
out their love for Portal, which is a game I have yet to play.

726
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,520
You need to bring it over, Loki, because I don't want to spend all that money for the

727
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,000
Orange Box, because I've been buying too many games lately.

728
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,080
Nothing against the folks at the Orange Box, but we need to share our resources here at

729
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,080
Orange Lounge Radio.

730
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,080
But I do want to play Portal.

731
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,800
I've heard a lot of good things about it.

732
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,680
And footy monsters repeating over and over in chat, the cake is a lie, which I know is

733
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,960
a reference to something in the game.

734
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
I've heard about the cake.

735
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,400
I've seen the ending.

736
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,240
It does look kind of cool.

737
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,920
Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line, if

738
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:03,040
you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

739
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,600
And I'm expecting we're going to get quite a few calls tonight, because sadly, last week,

740
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:11,400
due to the outage of our internet on the broadcast computer, we weren't able to take Skype calls.

741
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,560
So I expect double the calls this week.

742
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,960
And boy, this is one hell of a final story tonight.

743
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,600
You know, they've got Pokémon everything out there this day and age, right?

744
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,140
They've got, you know, the Pokémon, well obviously, look at my collection of stuffed

745
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,140
animals up here.

746
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,960
You've got the Pokémon, the Pikachus I have, little stuffed Jigglypuffs, you can get them

747
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,840
on mugs, shirts, hell, probably underoos with Pokémon on them too.

748
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,840
But now you can get Pokémon Perfume.

749
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:45,680
That's right, you can smell like Pikachu, I guess?

750
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,280
Peek-a-poo!

751
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,600
It's made by AirVal International, is the name of the group that puts this out.

752
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,280
It'll cost you $15 US.

753
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,520
Please do not buy this for your children, because there's enough stinky perfume in the

754
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,520
world, thank you.

755
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,520
Who knows?

756
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,520
Actually, I wish sometimes the internet had a scratch and sniff thing on it, because I'm

757
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,200
kind of curious, what does Pikachu perfume smell like?

758
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,240
It's probably just some kind of like generic scent, I don't know.

759
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,880
I think that almost all perfume smells nasty though, but I'm allergic to it.

760
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,000
Now Footy Monster would like to point out, when I was a kid, you could get Transformers

761
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,240
perfume Skye, it's not that rare to see perfumes of the popular franchises.

762
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,840
Yeah, but still, come on.

763
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Come on.

764
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,600
Pikachu perfume?

765
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,600
I don't know.

766
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,600
Whatever.

767
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,120
Son of Dad thinks they should make Pokemon lube.

768
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
Ew.

769
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
Ew.

770
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,120
No.

771
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,120
Do not want.

772
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
Do not want.

773
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,120
Skype line is open for business.

774
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,960
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

775
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,520
Go ahead and give us a call, and everything you want to talk about that we've talked about

776
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,880
on this week's show, or maybe there's a story that you want to talk about that we didn't

777
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,600
get to tonight, because actually in our choosing stories threads behind the scenes, there's

778
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,720
quite a lot of stories that didn't make the cut tonight.

779
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,400
I'm sure Loki will be getting to some of them, though, in last minute stories.

780
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,120
So Loki, while we wait for some calls, why don't we go over some last minute stories?

781
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,240
Okay.

782
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,280
There is one interesting thing, real briefly.

783
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,320
There is a Mass Effect Limited Edition coming out.

784
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,800
It's only going to be available online only through EBN GameStop, which is kind of weird.

785
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:25,680
But I don't know, it comes out the same day, so November 20th.

786
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,520
Let's see here.

787
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,080
Then there was some other stuff, I guess, coming from Nintendo Power.

788
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,160
Chris Slate, he was saying that there's going to be a brand new online community coming

789
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:44,840
soon from Nintendo Power, because remember, they closed the insider forums at one time.

790
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:50,840
Also, another interesting thing from the Simpsons game, which is of course being put out by

791
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,840
EA.

792
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,160
Grant that Scratchy's no more.

793
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,720
They've been made to change the name to Mob Rules now.

794
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,080
So apparently those lawsuit things were working.

795
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,080
Wow.

796
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,080
Alright, well we're...

797
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
I just lost the call.

798
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,240
We had a call coming in on Skype and I missed it.

799
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,240
Damn it.

800
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,240
No.

801
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,240
I have a story.

802
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
Alright, sure, Jamie.

803
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,240
Real quick.

804
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,560
Flint Dill, I guess that's how his last name is pronounced, was one of the writers for

805
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,760
Riddick and he's working on the Sin City game and he and Frank Miller are working together

806
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
on it.

807
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,240
And the quote says, Frank and I have been having a party coming up with nasty stuff

808
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
for the game.

809
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,120
In true Sin City fashion, some old characters will return, new characters will appear and

810
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,800
without giving anything away, probably die horribly.

811
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,280
Well, I don't know if the game is going to be anything like the movie.

812
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,560
I'm sure I will feel it is all style and no substance.

813
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,960
I saw a little bit of the movie and I thought it was horrible.

814
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,600
Not my favorite movie in the world, but it's certainly pretty to look at.

815
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,900
Hey, we're finally getting some calls on Skype line.

816
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,900
Welcome to Orange Launch Radio.

817
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:45,900
Who's this?

818
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,900
Hey guys, what's up?

819
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,900
This is Footy Monster.

820
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,900
Hi, Footy Monster.

821
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,900
How you doing?

822
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,900
Not too bad, not too bad.

823
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,240
What about you guys?

824
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,960
I noticed that last week you had quite a hectic show.

825
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,040
Can you sort it all out?

826
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,400
Yeah, last week's show was very interesting.

827
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,720
We had surprise guests, surprise outages.

828
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,720
Chris was here.

829
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,400
Of course, we love Chris and Puppy was here, which was awesome.

830
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:14,040
And then we had, the show didn't get started for 40 minutes or no, it was 20 minutes it

831
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:20,640
took us to get the show started because in our studio, we used to have four mics and

832
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,680
one of the mics started failing, which is our guest mics.

833
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,920
And it was a microphone that I believe Eddie or Casper the Gay was using on episode 250

834
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,560
and it was really cutting out bad, so we had to ditch that mic.

835
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:37,200
And then for whatever reason, the mic cable was not working on Loki's mic, like the cable

836
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,520
just stopped working.

837
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,720
It's not the microphone because we tested it with the other cable.

838
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,160
So we thought, okay, take the old cable from the mic that broke and put it on the microphone

839
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,040
that still works, but that didn't work, it caused a horrendous buzz.

840
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,800
And so, oh my gosh, it was just horrible.

841
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,480
But we fixed it, we went and we got a new cable and a new microphone and everything's

842
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,760
hunky-dory again and we're up to four microphones, which is going to be great for our guests.

843
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,760
So very happy.

844
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,720
And then of course our internet went out during part B, so we had no live element last week,

845
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,720
which kind of sucked.

846
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,880
But then we did the Operator 11 stuff, the bonus show we did for the live host.

847
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,880
Which was really cool, by the way.

848
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,640
Yeah, we actually had a lot of fun doing it and we're kind of doing it again tonight.

849
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,080
Even for the podcast listeners, if you go to operator11.com a little later, you're actually

850
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,760
going to see our Guitar Hero 3 preview.

851
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,240
We're going to unbox the demo kit and show you guys the guitar and the changeable face

852
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,820
plate and to show you guys all the in-z's and out-z's of Guitar Hero 3 a little later

853
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,820
on this evening.

854
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,720
So for those of you listening on the podcast, check that out at operator11.com.

855
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,440
I'll definitely be there checking it out.

856
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,440
Thank you.

857
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,440
Is that all you wanted to ask?

858
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,440
Nope.

859
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,520
No, she had a little comment from the dark side because it's like, go ahead Mike, grab

860
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,880
a little pause on Music Jam, Hamilton Music Jam.

861
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,880
What's up?

862
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,320
I actually played it and it's good.

863
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,320
That's right.

864
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,000
I remember you getting all excited about the Hannah Montana game and now you actually have

865
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,640
it in your possession.

866
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,880
So tell us a little bit again about the Hannah Montana game.

867
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,280
Okay, so good news for low-key.

868
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,860
It is not that pink and fluffy, but seriously, the only time you see the face of the girl

869
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,760
and all the pinkness is in the beginning, like you see the splash screen.

870
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,000
But other than that, the game is pretty normal, low-key with the girliness.

871
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,040
So I guess that's a good thing.

872
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:21,280
But what's interesting is that the way it's set up, like when you start the game, you

873
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,320
don't have the freedom to choose, for instance, to play just the drums or to play just the

874
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,320
bass guitar.

875
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,200
You're supposed to make the song.

876
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,300
So because of that, you first have to play the lead guitar and make the rhythm, which

877
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,300
you can record.

878
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,240
You have metronome so you can do everything and it's really like jam sessions.

879
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,880
Like you press the D-pad and you select the chords, you have a whole selection of chords,

880
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,680
but you can't customize the chords like you can in jam sessions.

881
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,760
So that's a plus for jam sessions, but not for Hannah Montana.

882
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,880
But then once you're done recording your lead guitar, which it's not just strumming, you

883
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,080
can also pick individual strings, which is really good, then you can record a bass with

884
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,400
individual strings for strumming.

885
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:10,320
You can record a guitar for little solos and stuff, and you can even do the whammy bar

886
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,320
and all that stuff.

887
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,320
So it's really interesting.

888
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,960
It's really feature complete.

889
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,960
Is there any…

890
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,080
The drum kit can play with two styluses if you want, so you have sort of like two little

891
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,000
drumsticks or you can use the whole DSO buttons.

892
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:31,120
Every button is signed for the drum stuff, so you can press like B and it does the big

893
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:36,480
drum thingy, and if you press like the D-pad, it does the hi-hat and stuff like that.

894
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:43,560
Is there like a plot or a stage set up or is it just like jam sessions where you just

895
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,720
kind of rock out?

896
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,800
Yeah, but you know what's funny, that you can then take your song and there's an option

897
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,240
to make a music video, which it features Hannah Montana.

898
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:58,640
You can change the camera around and make her play or make her dance around.

899
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,480
I mean seriously, it's a feature that's not there, which you might not like, but it's

900
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,960
so much more feature complete, I'm surprised.

901
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,480
Well, you've definitely become the unofficial spokesperson for the Hannah Montana franchise

902
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,040
here on the show, so I'm curious to hear if some of our listeners actually go out and

903
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,280
pick up this game and what they also think of it.

904
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,040
So I'm glad to hear that it was only 20 bucks, so not too bad a bargain.

905
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,720
Well, hey, we've got to let you go to let some other folks on, but thank you so much

906
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,880
for your call and have fun with the Hannah Montana.

907
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,880
All right.

908
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
All right.

909
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
Cool guys.

910
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,880
Take care.

911
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,880
Take care.

912
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,880
If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orangeloungeradio.

913
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,840
Meanwhile, any more last minute stories over yonder, over hither?

914
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,520
Yeah, some interesting things.

915
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:52,480
There is a new Logitech PC controller that apparently worked perfectly on the PlayStation

916
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,320
3.

917
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
I don't know.

918
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,320
It was kind of interesting.

919
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,120
It's a cool action game pad is what it is, but it works on the PlayStation 3, which is

920
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:07,200
kind of surprising that a PC controller would work on it.

921
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,160
And then another thing, which is kind of funny, and just mention it.

922
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,280
Apparently Gran Turismo 5 is not really 1080p.

923
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,280
Let's go to another call.

924
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
Hi, you're on Orangeloungeradio.

925
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,280
Who's this?

926
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,280
Hey, what's up?

927
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,280
This is Rheoma.

928
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,280
Hey, Rheoma.

929
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,280
What's on your mind, buddy?

930
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,280
Nothing much.

931
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,000
It was actually something that I was kind of interested in asking you guys.

932
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,800
I've been kind of on a Super Metroid tear recently.

933
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,120
It's probably one of my favorite Super Nintendo games.

934
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:38,280
But obviously one of the fascinations of the games is the speed run element.

935
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:42,040
So I just want to know, what do you guys think of the speed run element?

936
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,200
I don't think I've ever heard you mention anything about it.

937
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,200
So what are your opinions on Super Nintendo games?

938
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,200
I'm sorry.

939
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,200
Run that by me one more time.

940
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:54,080
You said Super Metroid and what, because you're a little bit fuzzy.

941
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,120
So say that again.

942
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,320
You want to know our opinion on?

943
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,320
Speed running.

944
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,600
Oh, speed running.

945
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,600
Speed running through the games.

946
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,600
Oh, yes.

947
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,840
Speed runs are great.

948
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,120
They're fun to watch on YouTube.

949
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,560
I'm not very good at it.

950
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,880
Actually, that's not true.

951
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:16,880
I have, just for shits and giggles, played through Mario Brothers as fast as I can, just

952
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,080
to kind of like, I don't want to say impress friends, because that's not really what I'm

953
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,120
doing, but just to kind of have fun.

954
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:29,300
Sometimes some of my friends who don't really get into video games all that much do remember

955
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,240
the old NES classics like Super Mario Brothers and kind of have fun watching somebody just

956
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,960
jam through the game.

957
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,960
Dark Sakura?

958
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:42,780
Well, remember I told you that I did the 8-1 level of Super Mario Brothers blindfolded?

959
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,120
That was during a speed run.

960
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,120
Wow.

961
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,120
That's awesome.

962
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,880
Well, it's because the whole level, if you don't, I mean, you can stop and try to get

963
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,640
all the points, but if you're trying to have a full time, close to a full time, or by the

964
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,880
time you get to the end of the thing and not get hit by anything, it's a definite pattern

965
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,500
to the whole level.

966
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,300
So that was, it was during a speed run that I did it blindfolded.

967
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:06,360
I probably couldn't do it since I haven't touched the game in five years, but, you know.

968
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,200
And certainly a game like Super Metroid encourages you to do speed runs because you know you

969
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,000
want the bra and panties shot at the end, so in order to get that, you have to go through

970
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,680
the game kind of as fast as you can.

971
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,600
And some folks, folks in chat room getting in on the conversation as well, Tiger Claw

972
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,960
says the thing about Metroid speed runs is they do a lot of sequence breaking, basically

973
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,560
collecting all the items and power-ups out of order.

974
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:32,220
And the thing about the original Metroid as well, I know you don't have to have this item

975
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:37,100
to beat the game, but it helps, but the screw attack, you can get that pretty early on,

976
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,240
and that makes the game so much easier, especially the old school Metroid.

977
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,960
Frisbee is plugging a site, speeddemosarchive.org.

978
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,960
And there's also speeddemosarchive.com.

979
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,960
Maybe you made a mistake.

980
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
I'm not sure.

981
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,160
Are there any particular speed demos that you're a fan of, Ryoma?

982
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,320
No, not really.

983
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:03,320
I personally think that speedrunning kind of takes the enjoyment out of the game.

984
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,240
I mean, I understand that somebody loves a game to the point where they can just play

985
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,240
through it really insanely quickly.

986
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,120
I can do that with Mega Man X. I can beat Mega Man X when I was really good at it in

987
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:18,160
about half an hour.

988
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,520
I mean, to me, it just kind of sucks the enjoyment out of the game.

989
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,520
I don't know.

990
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:28,280
Well, for me, it's just like one extra challenge in a game that may not necessarily be there

991
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,280
originally.

992
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,640
Like, if you look at a list of, it's kind of like achievements on the Xbox 360.

993
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,680
If you look at a list of 20 different things you can do on a game, speedrunning the game

994
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:44,480
is one thing that you can do for fun, but I wouldn't obsess over speedruns or think

995
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,320
somebody sucks because they can't get through a game fast because there's different ways

996
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,320
to play the game.

997
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:55,200
There's also the complete anal retentive gameplay, which is me on any role-playing game.

998
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,800
I search everything.

999
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:02,520
I talk to everybody, but I finish most of those games with some type of 100% completion

1000
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:07,560
or something like that because I'm so freaking anal retentive in my RPGs because I feel like

1001
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,320
I'm missing out on the story or I'm missing something important if I don't do it.

1002
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,740
So that's like the complete opposite of a speedrun.

1003
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,880
But I think that's one way you can certainly enjoy a game as well, right?

1004
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,880
Yeah.

1005
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,920
I mean, I understand that.

1006
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,600
I've never been one of those guys personally.

1007
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,880
You're probably somewhere in the middle.

1008
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,880
Most people are.

1009
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,880
Yeah.

1010
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,880
Well, very cool.

1011
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,920
Well, you know what?

1012
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,920
You're right.

1013
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,720
We haven't talked about speedrunning a lot on the show, but there you go.

1014
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,940
That's why we invite the calls.

1015
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,080
They get us to talk about things we may not normally talk about.

1016
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,400
So anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1017
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
Yeah.

1018
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,400
One more thing.

1019
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,840
Yeah, don't buy Boogie.

1020
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,840
Don't buy Boogie.

1021
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,520
Why should I stay the hell away from Boogie?

1022
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,000
Because it's a terrible game.

1023
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,240
What about it is so terrible?

1024
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,240
Wait.

1025
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,240
Say that again.

1026
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,740
What about it is so terrible?

1027
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,440
The karaoke is terrible.

1028
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,840
It's a very simple game.

1029
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,520
I found absolutely no enjoyment in it.

1030
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,800
So I mean, maybe there's some rhythm game, like super hardcore rhythm aficionado out

1031
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,500
there that'll love Boogie.

1032
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,640
I didn't.

1033
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,720
Or maybe a 12-year-old girl somewhere.

1034
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,360
Rababa in our chat room agrees with you, says Boogie is a doorstop.

1035
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,960
You can't adjust timing.

1036
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,960
It's a doorstop.

1037
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,960
Nice.

1038
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,960
All right.

1039
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,360
Well, Ryoma, thanks so much for the call, and stay the hell away from Boogie, everybody.

1040
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,360
Amen.

1041
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,360
All right.

1042
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,360
Have a good one, buddy.

1043
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,360
You too.

1044
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,360
All right.

1045
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,180
So a very cold review for Boogie.

1046
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,680
By the way, just be prepared.

1047
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,720
If you're going to call in and tell us that a game sucks, we are going to ask you why.

1048
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,160
We try to kind of get into it.

1049
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,600
And I do this to Loki, too, when he says, don't play this.

1050
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,600
It sucks.

1051
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,600
Well, why?

1052
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,800
You know, because there's reasons why you love games, but there's also reasons why you

1053
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,800
hate them.

1054
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,440
Well, we want to know why a game sucks.

1055
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,320
So if you want to give us a call, we'll take at least one more call.

1056
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:02,080
Use the name OrangeOnsRadio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR, and look, we're getting a call right now.

1057
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,080
So let's take it.

1058
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,080
Hi.

1059
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,080
You're on OrangeOnsRadio.

1060
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,080
Who's this?

1061
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,080
It's GS68.

1062
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,080
Hi, GS68.

1063
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,280
When are you guys bringing back guys on the show?

1064
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,680
Our spin-off show is on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1065
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,800
That's a very good question.

1066
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,400
When are we bringing back?

1067
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,200
You know, our spin-off shows have been having a lot of trauma lately.

1068
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,720
Unfortunately, Jamie's computer went poof, so that kind of screwed our Tuesday show.

1069
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,460
Xtifer moved, which kind of screwed our Wednesday show.

1070
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,960
Our Thursday show is still going, SDFU.

1071
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,960
Actually, no.

1072
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:38,760
Like, sometimes I drop by to listen to SDFU, but, like, nothing happens.

1073
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:45,040
Well, I'll have to get on our buddy up in Washington, Insanist, and see what's going

1074
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,040
on with that.

1075
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:50,800
I would say probably our weeknight shows are going to be in a bit of limbo.

1076
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,720
We're just kind of focusing everything on the Sunday shows right now, but I'm hoping

1077
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,760
around the time when we can kind of re-energize our website, because our website's falling

1078
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,880
apart too, kind of around the same time we were able to give that a kick in the ass,

1079
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,720
which I'm hoping will be by year's end, we can kind of go back to the whole spin-off

1080
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,720
shows and really being more of a station than just one solitary show.

1081
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,080
So I'm sorry to hear you miss them, but I hope they will come back soon.

1082
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,440
I know Xtifer's interested in doing the show again, so I'll get with them and see what

1083
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,440
we can do.

1084
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,240
I know Rice Princess was very gung-ho about her Less Than Three idea, and I've had some

1085
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,360
other proposals for shows I'm excited about too, and I know Jamie wants to get started

1086
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,520
again as soon as she gets her computer up and running.

1087
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,520
Yes?

1088
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,520
If I ever do.

1089
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,520
I hope you do.

1090
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,120
And you also were tossing around, I don't know if I can even say, but there was another

1091
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,120
show idea you were tossing around.

1092
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
Working on it.

1093
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,120
Working on it.

1094
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:47,320
So I'm hoping 2008, in the early stages of that, we can really refocus, but for right

1095
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:53,160
now we're making sure our Sunday show is staying consistent and doing this, so that's all we

1096
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
got.

1097
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:01,960
Besides, I have a class from 53645, and it takes me around 15 to 30 minutes to get back

1098
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:09,680
to my house from my campus, so it'll be hard to catch guys on the show if I wanted to.

1099
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:16,840
Well, I can tell you that the shows that don't use licensed music as a part of it, we may

1100
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,680
be looking into doing more podcasting.

1101
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,240
You know, STFU is being podcasted for a little bit there.

1102
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,920
We're thinking about it, so it's very possible.

1103
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,920
You may see that.

1104
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,920
So you can listen whenever you want?

1105
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:27,920
All right.

1106
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,920
Because hell, everybody podcasts these days.

1107
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:33,400
Well, I don't listen to podcasts anymore.

1108
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,000
I like the live experience better.

1109
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,500
I agree the live experience is ten times better, which is why we do this, and I think is part

1110
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,960
of what sets us apart from a lot of other folks that do this.

1111
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:50,200
You know, the live element is great, and I can't imagine doing a tape show, at least

1112
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,400
not right now.

1113
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
I don't know.

1114
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,400
Who knows?

1115
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,400
It's a whole other challenge.

1116
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,400
All right.

1117
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,100
Well, GS68, thanks so much for the call, and thanks for being such a fan of the station

1118
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:03,000
and calling us on our crap when we're missing out on the stuff we should be doing.

1119
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
No problem.

1120
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
All right.

1121
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Take care, buddy.

1122
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
See you.

1123
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Bye-bye.

1124
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,840
Ah, our website does need some help badly.

1125
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:17,080
I seem to remember like a long time ago we got some offer from a website design company

1126
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,080
in our mailbag.

1127
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,080
We should have taken it.

1128
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,840
That's why we didn't.

1129
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,120
If you design websites and think you have some good ideas for us, we're looking for

1130
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:29,840
something we can update very easily, like how WordPress will just let you go right in

1131
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,840
there and type a new story.

1132
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,040
We need something easy so we can stay on top of it.

1133
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,640
We'll see.

1134
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,640
We're exploring ideas.

1135
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,380
I have a lot of time off this Christmas, and I'm going to be definitely focusing on Orange

1136
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:46,160
Lounge Radio during that time and definitely stalking Dark Soccer and Loki for all their

1137
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,120
help.

1138
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:52,200
So I don't see the phone ringing anymore, but let's see if there's any more last minute

1139
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,080
stories and we'll see if we get any other calls.

1140
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,200
Okay, other fun stuff about that beautiful Katamari download content that we talked about

1141
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,200
earlier.

1142
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,280
They're just keys.

1143
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,740
All that info was already in the game, so you're just unlocking the ability to play

1144
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:05,740
it.

1145
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:06,740
Hooray!

1146
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:10,200
You've got to love it when game companies do that.

1147
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:17,240
Let's see what else.

1148
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:22,180
There should be some type of ban on being able to call that downloadable content.

1149
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,440
That's not downloadable content when it's already on the disk.

1150
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,920
That is unlocked content.

1151
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,760
That is pay to unlock content.

1152
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,960
I think we should start a movement that we are not going to refer to that stuff as downloadable

1153
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,560
content anymore.

1154
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,560
Let's call it what it is.

1155
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,600
It's pay to unlock content.

1156
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,040
Anyway, I just wanted to start a revolution.

1157
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,040
Never mind me.

1158
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,800
Well, you know, if we wanted to start a revolution, we could also get rid of the micro-transaction

1159
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,800
term.

1160
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,800
God, this is stupid.

1161
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,640
No, there's that too.

1162
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,320
There's this one website.

1163
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,080
It's One Player Start or One Piece Start.

1164
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:02,800
Apparently, they have a comprehensive list of people who are ruining Halo 3 and it runs

1165
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,600
down in the wonderful categories swordsmen.

1166
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:11,440
That's the first people, of course, that play Halo 3 that use nothing but swords.

1167
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:21,920
Rocket whores, laser lovers, children, campers, hip-slinging snipers, achievement whores,

1168
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:30,520
deserters, heavy brothers, and I guess that's it.

1169
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,720
Heavy breathers, my mistake.

1170
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,720
That makes more sense.

1171
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,240
I guess that's going to go ahead and do it for us tonight and wrap up because we do want

1172
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,880
to get out of here at a somewhat reasonable hour because we're going to be doing the Guitar

1173
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,320
Hero 3 thing in a little bit.

1174
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,880
So we're going to wrap it up and say goodnight, but in order to do that, we have to go around

1175
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,640
and get everybody's final thought.

1176
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,640
We'll start with Loki tonight.

1177
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,020
Loki, your final thought.

1178
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:58,700
My final thought is, there's a lot of games coming out soon, I need more money.

1179
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:03,280
My final thought is root beer is delicious, but root beer floats are even better.

1180
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,960
Ooh, but Dole Whip floats are the best.

1181
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,880
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

1182
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,680
I don't have one.

1183
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,280
Abstaining tonight from the final thought process.

1184
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,280
That's okay.

1185
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,280
No.

1186
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,280
It's a free country.

1187
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,280
I just don't have one.

1188
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,280
All right.

1189
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,280
Fair enough.

1190
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:24,780
Well, thank you guys very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting

1191

1195
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,640
We appreciate it.

1196
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,640
All right.

1197
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,120
That's it, guys.

1198
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,120
Tune in next week.

1199
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,720
