00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:14,759
[SPEAKER_04]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:19,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:23,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, October the 21st, 2007.

5
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, Orange Lounge Radio does tape live on Sunday nights.

6
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:36,088
[SPEAKER_05]: and releases the live show in two parts, Part A and B. And you're listening to Part B right now, which means we've already taken care of the formalities.

7
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:38,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's get back to the gaming news.

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,114
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, something we've been talking about for the last few weeks here is the Xbox 360 Arcade SKU.

9
00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:46,895
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't exist, but it actually does.

10
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:54,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, there's been some interesting proof for this, including someone actually buying one.

11
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,882
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, duh.

12
00:00:57,483 --> 00:00:57,663
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

13
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:03,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is basically a core system now with a wireless controller.

14
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:05,106
[SPEAKER_06]: It does have HDMI on it.

15
00:01:05,446 --> 00:01:14,908
[SPEAKER_06]: It will feature a 256 megabyte memory unit and a disc including five Xbox Live Arcade trial games, apparently.

16
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:22,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom Boom Rocket, Feeding Frenzy, Luxor 2, and Pac-Man Championship and Uno.

17
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,031
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking lame.

18
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:25,471
[SPEAKER_06]: They're only trial games?

19
00:01:26,568 --> 00:01:26,768
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

20
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:49,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

21
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:51,586
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't really say what it's on there.

22
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:55,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe if Microsoft will actually acknowledge the existence of this.

23
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:56,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you this much.

24
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not supposed to say anything, but it's going to be fucking announced on the 23rd officially because that's the day it comes out.

25
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:02,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's fine.

26
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:03,756
[SPEAKER_05]: This podcast won't hit until the 23rd.

27
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:06,478
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be officially announced on the 23rd.

28
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why, even after all this stuff, that they're still insisting on keeping it a fucking secret.

29
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:14,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when people are leaking it out there, it's been purchased.

30
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:15,406
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been out there.

31
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Why they're still denying it's coming out, but they have a whole marketing plan behind it, how they're going to promote it and stuff.

32
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:23,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So it will be officially announced on the 23rd.

33
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:25,616
[SPEAKER_05]: What's so special about the 23rd?

34
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:29,239
[SPEAKER_06]: It's whenever they're fucking... It's when this is coming out.

35
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:31,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why.

36
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it line up with an expo or something?

37
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:35,242
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just whenever they feel like it.

38
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:36,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

39
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:44,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess, I think also at the same time, that's when the Elite console, or the bundle that they're doing for the holidays is coming out as well.

40
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:44,408
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

41
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:50,976
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it.

42
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:53,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a huge surprise.

43
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:57,007
[SPEAKER_06]: It was totally not coming out or anything.

44
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:05,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to the rumor camp, and you know, most Microsoft rumors do end up being true, so this could be something that does come to light.

45
00:03:06,113 --> 00:03:06,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I don't know.

46
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,333
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a little bit far-fetched for me.

47
00:03:09,114 --> 00:03:10,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to mention, sorry, real quick.

48
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:12,974
[SPEAKER_06]: It was confirmed by Microsoft.

49
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:15,975
[SPEAKER_06]: They did confirm that it is, you know, coming.

50
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:18,136
[SPEAKER_06]: They just never said anything else beyond that.

51
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:20,256
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're like, you just need to wait for details.

52
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:24,877
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, Arcade for us is the ability to bring in a new set of audiences.

53
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:27,298
[SPEAKER_06]: They're probably a little bit more casually focused.

54
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:32,726
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're looking for a new family experience and they're more price focused.

55
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:38,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Robbie Bach told Financial Times, marketing Microsoft's first public comments about the new SKU.

56
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:42,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, they didn't really say what was included with it or any of the details and stuff.

57
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:51,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, 23rd, all this will be finally officially announced and our Microsoft rep can finally calm down a little bit.

58
00:03:52,116 --> 00:04:00,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this will be something that could bring people in, and that is combining the HD DVD player and the Xbox 360.

59
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:02,738
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of us have kind of wondered, why hasn't this been done already?

60
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:11,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there are rumors going around that Toshiba is actually teaming up with Microsoft to be making an actual HD DVD slash Xbox 360.

61
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:19,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I hear this, my mind kind of goes to, you remember the Panasonic Q, I think it was called, that was the GameCube slash DVD player that you could only get in Japan?

62
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:20,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Duel HD Tuners with a Program Guide

63
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:54,777
[SPEAKER_05]: An MP3 player dock and possibly also a 40-inch TV to come with it or sold separately that will dock the actual 360.

64
00:04:54,897 --> 00:04:56,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a funny thought.

65
00:04:56,518 --> 00:05:03,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I remember way back when they were talking about TVs that would have the original Xbox integrated into them.

66
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:04,727
[SPEAKER_06]: and something like this.

67
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:06,828
[SPEAKER_06]: How much do you want to bet this isn't actually a 360?

68
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:13,271
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Toshiba HD DVD player that will also play Xbox 360 games.

69
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,452
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of what the Panasonic Q was, right?

70
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:17,633
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just a DVD player that would also play GameCube games.

71
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:18,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of cool.

72
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:24,257
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, here's why folks are getting all speculative about this.

73
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:31,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently an unnamed or unknown Toshiba rep actually said, an Xbox with a built-in DVD drive is critical.

74
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:33,122
[SPEAKER_05]: They and we are working on it.

75
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:36,084
[SPEAKER_05]: It also has to be more than a gaming machine.

76
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:37,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft recognizes this.

77
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:41,968
[SPEAKER_05]: A version of the device may also be sold under the Toshiba brand name.

78
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,371
[SPEAKER_02]: That would make sense.

79
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:48,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, didn't we have a bajillion different versions of the CD-i?

80
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose.

81
00:05:51,963 --> 00:06:00,854
[SPEAKER_05]: It is kind of interesting because I don't think we've seen anything really like this since the Panasonic Q. And even then, the Panasonic Q wasn't even sold here.

82
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:02,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the thing too about that.

83
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,881
[SPEAKER_06]: That way, if it is branded under the Toshiba name,

84
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:07,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

85
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope the HD DVD ends up winning out, because otherwise that's going to be a big pile of useless crap.

86
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:42,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least there's quite a few movies already available, including Heroes Season 1, which I still need to buy on HD DVD.

87
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:45,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really care about HD DVD at all, though.

88
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Blu-ray player.

89
00:06:48,173 --> 00:06:48,893
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, lady.

90
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:56,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in other HD DVD news, you're also going to be given five...

91
00:06:57,443 --> 00:07:00,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Free movies if you buy the Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on.

92
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:16,854
[SPEAKER_02]: You can choose from Serenity, which is like the best movie ever, The Chronicles of Riddick, Hulk, Children of Men, The Fast and the Furious, Tokyo Drift, Troy, Full Metal Jacket, yeah, Corpse Bride, The Prestige, Swordfish, Black Rain, Dreamgirls, and World Trade Center.

93
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:22,898
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you claim this is you fill out a form, send in a copy of your barcode,

94
00:07:23,872 --> 00:07:26,553
[SPEAKER_02]: and Microsoft will send you your stuff within 28 days.

95
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:54,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I can understand how the iPhone folks feel.

96
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:55,158
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

97
00:07:55,238 --> 00:07:58,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Serenity is actually a movie I still need to get on HD DVD.

98
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I somehow don't have it yet.

99
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,680
[SPEAKER_06]: That's at Christmas, by the way.

100
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:19,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, it's kind of funny that you mentioned Heroes earlier because I believe that Best Buy is doing a thing right now where you can get a HD DVD add-on for the 360 and get a free copy of the Heroes HD DVD set, including also those five extra DVDs that you can mail away for.

101
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:21,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just missed out on everything, didn't I?

102
00:08:22,146 --> 00:08:22,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

103
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:25,646
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

104
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:53,762
[SPEAKER_06]: The Weaver Girl, Shopping Spree, and High Calorie Katamari.

105
00:08:54,782 --> 00:09:03,563
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically what these are, the Milky Way Constellation has you roll up 88 constellations to create a new Milky Way.

106
00:09:04,304 --> 00:09:10,085
[SPEAKER_06]: The Weaver Girl, you roll up a huge ball of yarn and string to create Vega, the Weaver Girl.

107
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:14,585
[SPEAKER_06]: And Shopping Spree, make a space station but be thrifty about it.

108
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:18,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess it sounds like an offshoot of a Katamari mission from

109
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:23,470
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the previous games where the value of items are collected and taken into account.

110
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,433
[SPEAKER_06]: And High Calorie Katamari, Feed Cetus the Whale, Roll Up Lots of Food.

111
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:33,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And that reminds me a little bit of the one from We Love Katamari where you roll the sumo wrestler around.

112
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that was cool.

113
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,021
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are available right now in Asia and Japan.

114
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:40,082
[SPEAKER_06]: No word on the U.S.

115
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:43,284
[SPEAKER_06]: yet, but I'm sure that they'll be coming soon.

116
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,720
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

117
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Let it be known that OLR knows how to forgive.

118
00:10:09,214 --> 00:10:10,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I went out and bought the game anyway.

119
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:15,656
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you look up forgiveness in the dictionary and see our picture next to it, you'll understand why.

120
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:16,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, don't worry.

121
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:17,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I know how to forgive.

122
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:18,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I went out and got the game as well.

123
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:19,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

124
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:20,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you did.

125
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:21,498
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

126
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:23,889
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

127
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:45,939
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

128
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Great track record with that game.

129
00:11:09,915 --> 00:11:10,737
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

130
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:15,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in time for the premiere of Razor, Battlestar Galactica Razor.

131
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the little miniseries about...

132
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:20,330
[SPEAKER_05]: The Pegasus will be debuting November 24th.

133
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:31,053
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, for those folks that are asking how much the game will cost, such as JAP28 is asking in our chat room, $20 on the PC, $800 Microsoft Points, or $10 on Xbox Live Arcade.

134
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:33,153
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get it a day earlier on PCs, October 23rd.

135
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:33,153
$20.

136
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too shabby.

137
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:47,544
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a little bit of joy, even though I'm probably not going to bother buying the game.

138
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:55,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega Superstar Tennis is going to have, of course, a bunch of different Sega characters in it.

139
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:57,026
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Sonic.

140
00:11:57,186 --> 00:12:00,186
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Amigo from Samba de Amigo, which I think is pretty cool.

141
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:01,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh la la.

142
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:05,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being worked on by Sumo Digital.

143
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not seeing anything else about who else is going to be in it.

144
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:14,983
[SPEAKER_02]: or a date for that matter, but we do have it on PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Nintendo DS.

145
00:12:15,744 --> 00:12:19,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Please tell me that every time Ulala hits the ball, she'll go, Chew!

146
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:20,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Chew!

147
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:21,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Chew!

148
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:23,547
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be good.

149
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,547
[SPEAKER_05]: For those that play Space Channel 5, that's fine.

150
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:29,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like what they mentioned on Kotaku, that they want to see characters from House of the Dead and Altered Beast.

151
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:30,389
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be cool.

152
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:31,170
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of rad.

153
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play as a zombie.

154
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,271
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd just be awesome.

155
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:37,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like, when you win, you eat the other person?

156
00:12:37,244 --> 00:12:39,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing Zombie Tennis, the game.

157
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:40,085
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of fun.

158
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:41,925
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

159
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:42,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you listening, Sega?

160
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:44,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it happen.

161
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:46,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's going to happen.

162
00:12:46,387 --> 00:12:47,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so either, but it's kind of a dream.

163
00:12:48,288 --> 00:13:02,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, one thing that is happening, though, and also on the 23rd, will be Guitar Hero music, available for download, at least a digital download, and including music from Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 2, and Guitar Hero Encore Rock the 80s.

164
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:09,051
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be available from Wave Group and I guess affiliating with other stuff.

165
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:16,355
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll be available, I guess, across such download sites as AOL, iTunes, Napster, Rhapsody, and Yahoo.

166
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:20,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody told me there's actually a DDR soundtrack on iTunes now for Supernova 2.

167
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:21,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know that.

168
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:22,858
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of neat.

169
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:24,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know either, so.

170
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:31,243
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to have our own little playlist uploaded on iTunes that had all the DDR music from the games and where they could be found on iTunes, but

171
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:32,557
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

172
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:59,815
[SPEAKER_05]: and hopefully the music won't stop like E4ALL did.

173
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:03,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody forgot to pay the bill at E4ALL and the power got shut off.

174
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:04,658
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just kidding.

175
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:05,679
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the reason why.

176
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:13,884
[SPEAKER_05]: But on Friday night at about 7 o'clock, E4ALL came to a very abrupt end because the lights went out.

177
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:18,588
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of folks were watching a match between Fatality.

178
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:24,792
[SPEAKER_05]: He was playing Quake 4 and some other folks were playing Super Mario Galaxy and some of the other games that were available there.

179
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:40,255
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the power shut off on the whole right half of South Hall and that would have been where the Nintendo and the EA booths were which were pretty much the main reasons why people were going to the show right there between those two and so they decided to end the show at that point.

180
00:14:40,975 --> 00:14:46,216
[SPEAKER_05]: The staff quickly escorted everybody out of the convention hall because when the power goes out that's actually not safe.

181
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:48,096
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a safety hazard.

182
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:48,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Money back!

183
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:49,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Refund!

184
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:54,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, but wasn't the show going to close at like 8 anyway?

185
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:59,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I don't remember the hours for the show, but I seem to recall it was going to close kind of early anyway.

186
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:03,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, this isn't the first time something like this has happened at the convention center.

187
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:06,678
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been some previous E3s where similar things have happened.

188
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:14,246
[SPEAKER_05]: But it just kind of sucks that it's happening for E2E4ALL when they've been taking a lot of crap.

189
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:21,687
[SPEAKER_05]: from various game blogs and stuff for not being up to the same level that many of us remember with the big E3 expos.

190
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:26,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So this doesn't help them try to get past that.

191
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:26,689
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

192
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, E4ALL.

193
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:31,611
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not.

194
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,512
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just saying that.

195
00:15:33,852 --> 00:15:34,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I am.

196
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,471
[SPEAKER_02]: The PS3 is actually seeing an increase in sales in Europe now.

197
00:15:42,371 --> 00:15:44,012
[SPEAKER_02]: They have gone up by 178%.

198
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:49,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

199
00:15:52,774 --> 00:15:58,056
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's with the introduction of the 60GB bundle and the new 40GB unit that came out.

200
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there a price drop that just went in there?

201
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:03,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, there was a price drop that happened too recently.

202
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, there was the price drop.

203
00:16:05,123 --> 00:16:20,428
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm sure there may be... They also were saying that the software sales increased with Resistance Fall of Man actually taking a rise in its chart status and Heavenly Sword and Motorstorm.

204
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:27,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are kind of the must-have PS3 games at this point, so not too surprising that folks getting their new PS3s are picking up those games.

205
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:29,831
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense to me.

206
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:32,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways...

207
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:37,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, they totally announced the 4D egg system for the US.

208
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:39,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so shocked.

209
00:16:40,114 --> 00:16:42,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not realize that that was coming.

210
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:43,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crap.

211
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,619
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the worst liar ever.

212
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy crap.

213
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,281
[SPEAKER_06]: So much enthusiasm.

214
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so Sony finally announced this system.

215
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:55,647
[SPEAKER_06]: They've really done a great job of keeping it under wraps.

216
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,048
[SPEAKER_06]: No one knew anything about it.

217
00:16:57,848 --> 00:17:00,189
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently, yeah, it's coming out now, November 2nd.

218
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:04,369
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll officially be $400 US for $399.99, however you want to look at it.

219
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,091
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, there is no, you know, backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 games.

220
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:14,792
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the same time, they've also dropped down the 80-gig system to $499.99.

221
00:17:14,972 --> 00:17:15,452
[SPEAKER_06]: So $100 cheaper.

222
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:15,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome!

223
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:22,987
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

224
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,821
[SPEAKER_05]: is that this has nothing to do with reducing Sony's cost of manufacturing.

225
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:54,142
[SPEAKER_05]: People would go and speculate that, oh, they had to fit a whole PlayStation 2 in the PlayStation 3, so taking that out saves them money.

226
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:54,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

227
00:17:55,543 --> 00:18:05,104
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why they did this was, quote, encouraging buyers of the entry-level PlayStation 3 to purchase more games designed specifically for the new system.

228
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:07,625
[SPEAKER_06]: You are an idiot.

229
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

230
00:18:10,071 --> 00:18:11,491
[SPEAKER_05]: That was horrible.

231
00:18:39,107 --> 00:18:39,687
[SPEAKER_06]: C'mon!

232
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:41,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Who let him talk?

233
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, who let him talk?

234
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Piker Uno in our chatroom would agree with you.

235
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:50,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Chat.orange.radio.com Piker Uno says, Sony PR, please shut the fuck up.

236
00:18:51,355 --> 00:18:51,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

237
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:52,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, please, please.

238
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:53,597
[SPEAKER_06]: C'mon!

239
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:55,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Who let him talk?

240
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:56,519
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I wanted to know.

241
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:59,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you don't... I'm sorry.

242
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:04,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to be as positive as I can with these guys, but they're really making it tough on me.

243
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:06,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

244
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:07,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

245
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:18,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they just came out the week before and said, okay, well, the reason why is because we removed these chips and we removed these chips so that we can cut the price a little bit so that we can drop the price of the system.

246
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:20,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that makes sense and logic there.

247
00:19:20,874 --> 00:19:26,236
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're just fucking with us and just removing it because you want to sell some more PlayStation 3 games...

248
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:27,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Well then, fuck you.

249
00:19:27,956 --> 00:19:28,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

250
00:19:29,357 --> 00:19:31,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting thought in our chat room.

251
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:39,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob Babak says in our chat room, or it could be that Sony wants you to buy backwards compatibility from the PlayStation Network.

252
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wouldn't that be mean?

253
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:45,040
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really mean if that's true.

254
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, but they have said it's software-based.

255
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,181
[SPEAKER_05]: That is definitely plausible.

256
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:51,101
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because it's software-based for the PlayStation 1.

257
00:19:52,547 --> 00:20:00,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was... They had what it was, they had a chip that was running the graphics stuff for the PlayStation 2, but the motion engine was software based.

258
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:08,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So unless they completely rewrote it to... But then didn't they get rid of, like in the European ones, didn't they get rid of that and replace it with software?

259
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:13,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they got rid of one of the two chips, but this 40 gig system has zero of the two chips.

260
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:16,015
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why it can't run anything.

261
00:20:17,272 --> 00:20:19,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all fucked up, however you look at it.

262
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:23,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they're going to make you buy backwards compatibility later on, that's also fucked up.

263
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:28,897
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just asking for Microsoft to just come back at you with some PR spin on it.

264
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

265
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:31,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I bought mine when I did.

266
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Some days I want to go, just cut your losses and let's hear about PlayStation 4.

267
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:39,742
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting harder.

268
00:20:39,842 --> 00:20:42,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Sony fanboys, but at the same time, I'm not.

269
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:46,225
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, they just don't

270
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,956
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't make a good case right about now, you know what I mean?

271
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:53,618
[SPEAKER_05]: They just keep shooting themselves in the foot over and over and over.

272
00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:54,538
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing.

273
00:20:54,758 --> 00:21:01,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, for the last few weeks, I've been really questioning whether I want to get Ratchet & Clank Future because I have it paid for.

274
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:05,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like, maybe I want something else instead.

275
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:07,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I can buy a 360 game with that or something.

276
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:11,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, I don't know.

277
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:15,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been downloading stuff off the Japanese PlayStation Network.

278
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:17,608
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually have some stuff to download on there.

279
00:21:18,948 --> 00:21:22,549
[SPEAKER_05]: On the bright side, maybe the price will drop again before Final Fantasy XIII comes out.

280
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:23,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I can dream.

281
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,430
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

282
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, seriously.

283
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,111
[SPEAKER_02]: When?

284
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:28,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what?

285
00:21:28,231 --> 00:21:33,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XIII will probably come out in Japan late next year, in 2009 at the earliest.

286
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:34,994
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be lucky if it comes out next year.

287
00:21:35,434 --> 00:21:35,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

288
00:21:35,774 --> 00:21:36,594
[SPEAKER_06]: You are lucky.

289
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

290
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe there will be another price drop before then.

291
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:40,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

292
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:41,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

293
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:41,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Me neither.

294
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:43,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I got stuff to play on other systems meanwhile.

295
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:44,317
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

296
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:49,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least the few things are going to be on PlayStation Network.

297
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:51,664
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Flow and Warhawk.

298
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:52,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Flow is spelled with a zero.

299
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:54,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It's leet.

300
00:21:55,707 --> 00:21:57,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's the way the game is.

301
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:57,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

302
00:21:58,328 --> 00:22:00,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks kind of electroplankton-y.

303
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you saying the game is a zero?

304
00:22:03,151 --> 00:22:03,891
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I like the game.

305
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:04,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought the game.

306
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:07,173
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only game I've bought from PlayStation Network.

307
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, these are expansions that are going to be out for there.

308
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:16,436
[SPEAKER_02]: The Flow expansion is going to have a multiplayer mode and a new playable creature.

309
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:21,841
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Warhawk is going to be another dropship.

310
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:25,123
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can pick up and relocate ground vehicles.

311
00:22:25,684 --> 00:22:27,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Multiplayer on Flow could be interesting.

312
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though wasn't Flow more of like a...

313
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:31,711
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something you play.

314
00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:33,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ambient.

315
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:57,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

316
00:22:57,067 --> 00:23:00,428
[SPEAKER_05]: These minimalist games, though, sometimes are extremely popular.

317
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:06,209
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think about it, every Xen Extra Extreme, which I was talking about earlier, there's one button in the game to blow up your ship.

318
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

319
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,231
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't have a problem with that game.

320
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:12,051
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I bought Flow.

321
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:13,471
[SPEAKER_06]: That says a lot.

322
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:17,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Because buying stuff off of the PlayStation Network is a bitch.

323
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:18,393
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't like doing it.

324
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:18,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

325
00:23:21,694 --> 00:23:26,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Kiki in our chatroom says, screw Flow, get Everyday Shooter, which is a game I've heard good things about.

326
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Everyday Shooter wasn't available when Flow first became available.

327
00:23:30,296 --> 00:23:34,838
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I've thought about buying that game too, because that looks good.

328
00:23:35,978 --> 00:23:43,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, another game, as I mentioned earlier, that I tried out, and it is available on the Japanese PlayStation Network, so if you don't have a Japanese account,

329
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:48,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Create one, download it, and then you can play it on any of your accounts.

330
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:51,165
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, the demo.

331
00:23:51,966 --> 00:23:54,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a demo for a demo, I guess.

332
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:57,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Or a demo for a demo game that you're going to have to buy or something like that.

333
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, it features, you know, a few cards.

334
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:07,977
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe there's like, I want to say like six cards to choose from or something in the very beginning.

335
00:24:09,718 --> 00:24:14,241
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's going to be just, you know, single player stuff, no online stuff.

336
00:24:16,214 --> 00:24:17,295
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cool looking game.

337
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's like one track.

338
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:20,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely worth checking out.

339
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:24,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, though, when this comes out, I wouldn't buy it.

340
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:28,085
[SPEAKER_06]: But, hey, if you love Gran Turismo, get your hands on this.

341
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:29,906
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the full game when it's released?

342
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:31,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't buy it.

343
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,971
[SPEAKER_06]: They're talking $40 for the full game.

344
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:35,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that.

345
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll wait for the real game to come out and pay like $20 more.

346
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:39,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what's the point?

347
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:53,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, the other thing too is make sure you download Gran Turismo HD if it's even still available on the PlayStation Network because I know that they're taking that down soon when 5 comes out.

348
00:24:54,712 --> 00:24:55,733
[SPEAKER_06]: But definitely worth checking it out.

349
00:24:55,813 --> 00:24:56,773
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cool looking game.

350
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:58,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, I wouldn't buy it.

351
00:24:58,994 --> 00:24:59,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

352
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:04,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, very interesting comment coming out of the San Jose Mercury News.

353
00:25:05,056 --> 00:25:09,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Dean Takahashi is a reporter for the Mercury News and talks often about video games.

354
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:29,809
[SPEAKER_05]: and he was writing earlier this week about the latest sales number and also said this quote quote one piece of news that came out this week was that Sony pleaded with third-party developers not to abandon its struggling platform that change in attitude is a marked difference compared to the arrogance of past years

355
00:25:30,478 --> 00:25:35,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting to think that Sony could be on its knees begging people not to leave right now.

356
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:38,525
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of makes me go, I wonder who's thinking of jumping ship right now.

357
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:39,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it makes sense.

358
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:41,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you think about it, I mean, look at it.

359
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:52,397
[SPEAKER_06]: The system has the least amount of, as far as, I hate calling it next gen, but as far as the next gen platforms, it has the least market share, at least in the U.S., and

360
00:25:53,157 --> 00:25:54,158
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

361
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:30,679
[SPEAKER_05]: said the PlayStation 3 was a waste of everyone's time and could be indicating why folks are starting to jump ship and Sony's begging people to stay around.

362
00:26:30,819 --> 00:26:35,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of which, Half-Life 2, The Orange Box, and PlayStation 3 not coming out until December now.

363
00:26:37,344 --> 00:26:46,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And as some folks are speculating, if at all, if you keep getting delay, delay, delay, eventually you might start seeing canceled, canceled, canceled.

364
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:48,572
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this holiday season could...

365
00:26:49,335 --> 00:26:50,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Make or Break Sony.

366
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't want to sound all like finalists here, but

367
00:26:52,898 --> 00:27:03,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if Sony doesn't manage to sell through a lot of consoles, it's interesting because Extrofer and I, for those who didn't hear the bonus segment tonight, Extrofer and I drove to Disneyland together and we were talking about game stuff.

368
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:09,003
[SPEAKER_05]: He was talking about how he works at a large retail chain right now that sells electronics as part of it.

369
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:14,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says, you know, he's like, I'm not biased, but I'm sitting there and I'm watching.

370
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:20,406
[SPEAKER_05]: We are selling quite a few Xbox 360, tons of Wii's I have never seen.

371
00:27:21,144 --> 00:27:28,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, keep in mind, he works overnights, but he sees these systems go, even in the overnight shifts, and he says, I have never seen us sell a PlayStation 3.

372
00:27:28,112 --> 00:27:32,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Walmart's kind of a weird demographic.

373
00:27:32,637 --> 00:27:35,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't think people go buy PlayStation 3s there.

374
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,064
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing... I mean, seriously, though...

375
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:42,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just taking it right now as to date.

376
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:49,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was talking to you about this before the show started because kind of going back to the whole I have judgment bet that we have right now.

377
00:27:49,154 --> 00:28:02,582
[SPEAKER_06]: So far, and I was looking at the numbers after the MPD group reported on for September, year to date, the PlayStation 3, there's not been a game that's sold over 400,000 units in the United States, which isn't that great.

378
00:28:02,863 --> 00:28:09,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when you consider like Halo sold, you know, 2 million units and there's a bunch of other games that have sold millions of units and stuff like that.

379
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:10,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

380
00:28:11,198 --> 00:28:16,923
[SPEAKER_06]: 300,000 or 335,000 if I remember correctly was for Resistance Fallen Man.

381
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:19,505
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that good.

382
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:23,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know people are waiting for Metal Gear Solid 4, which is going to be an awesome game.

383
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:27,311
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will be probably a must-have game for the PlayStation 3.

384
00:28:27,411 --> 00:28:37,319
[SPEAKER_06]: It may help them sell some units, but I think a lot of people, and hope to God that they don't announce that there's going to be an Xbox 360 version for that around the same time,

385
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:45,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that may sell some units for them, but at the same time, they're going to lose out this holiday, for sure.

386
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:46,748
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a fact.

387
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:52,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the time that all these good games come around, it's going to be too late.

388
00:28:52,991 --> 00:28:53,911
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really what it's going to be.

389
00:28:55,932 --> 00:29:01,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope they make it, because I'd like to see all three consoles doing good, but I don't know.

390
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:03,716
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

391
00:29:04,597 --> 00:29:04,877
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

392
00:29:05,934 --> 00:29:09,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yet again, another Sony debate here on the program.

393
00:29:09,155 --> 00:29:11,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we love to always get your perspective.

394
00:29:11,176 --> 00:29:13,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there's some people that feel very differently about this whole issue.

395
00:29:14,316 --> 00:29:17,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to express your opinion.

396
00:29:17,878 --> 00:29:24,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And every week here on the program, we like to read your emails here on the program and respond to them, if appropriate.

397
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:30,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So DarkSakura likes to read the emails at Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com in our Mailbag segment.

398
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:40,738
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I understand this week, not a lot of people expressing their opinions, huh?

399
00:29:41,358 --> 00:29:41,618
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

400
00:29:42,098 --> 00:29:43,539
[SPEAKER_05]: That's too bad.

401
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:50,242
[SPEAKER_02]: First email says, Hey, I'd really like the new segment, and I think it's fun to reminisce on old but great games.

402
00:29:50,782 --> 00:29:56,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I would actually like to request a game to be featured in this segment, Riftstar for the Sega Genesis.

403
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,386
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my all-time favorites.

404
00:29:59,486 --> 00:29:59,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

405
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:00,507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from Osfer.

406
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:02,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe one day.

407
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:05,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really play it that much.

408
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:08,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe now's the time to start.

409
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:12,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have a game picked up for next week, although it's really, really, really obscure.

410
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,211
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens when you're out in November?

411
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:15,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean Loki and I get to pick some games?

412
00:30:16,011 --> 00:30:16,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

413
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:27,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'll go ahead and tell you the one I thought about doing next week that I'm not going to do was Kaze No Regret, the real sound game that came out on the Saturn that was sound only, and you got a packet of seeds with it.

414
00:30:29,254 --> 00:30:31,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to be seeing nothing but Sega games?

415
00:30:31,395 --> 00:30:31,515
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

416
00:30:31,795 --> 00:30:32,235
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, good.

417
00:30:34,008 --> 00:30:36,910
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is going to be on vacation a couple weeks in November

418
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:05,777
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

419
00:31:06,318 --> 00:31:13,504
[SPEAKER_02]: The last email is, Dear OLR, this is a theory that has been floating around the internets for some time, the third console curse.

420
00:31:14,745 --> 00:31:22,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, this theory states that every third console by every leading publisher will ultimately fail or do significantly less better than its predecessor.

421
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:23,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Just think about it.

422
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:25,774
[SPEAKER_02]: The Atari 5200 was Atari's third system and it failed.

423
00:31:25,894 --> 00:31:26,274
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it didn't.

424
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:32,788
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sega Saturn was Sega's third home system, and it slowly died because producing its motherboard was so expensive.

425
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they didn't really support it very well in the U.S.

426
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:41,950
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nintendo 64 did not fare well due to Sony's more powerful system and CD-based media.

427
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,490
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

428
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:47,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, Sony and its PlayStation 3, which I need not explain, especially since we just went over it.

429
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:55,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the N64 and Saturn were pretty awesome systems, you can't help but say they did fail to their rival systems in terms of sales.

430
00:31:56,246 --> 00:32:00,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that this argument has no base whatsoever, but I just wanted to throw this out.

431
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:07,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, the Saturn was not the third system.

432
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:09,696
[SPEAKER_06]: The Saturn was the master system.

433
00:32:09,736 --> 00:32:16,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Master system, Genesis, Sega CD, 32X, and then this... Well, 32X I wouldn't really call a system.

434
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:17,522
[SPEAKER_06]: It was more of an add-on.

435
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:17,963
[SPEAKER_06]: But if...

436
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:19,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Still, it's not 13th.

437
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Or 5th.

438
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:22,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that doesn't really count.

439
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:25,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

440
00:32:25,683 --> 00:32:27,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of want to say something controversial.

441
00:32:27,764 --> 00:32:28,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

442
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you why they all failed.

443
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:32,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they all appeared on the cover of Madden NFL.

444
00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:34,368
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why they all failed.

445
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:41,056
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the controversial thing I want to say, our emailer says that Nintendo 64 was a good system with the Saturn.

446
00:32:41,136 --> 00:32:41,656
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree.

447
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:43,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that Nintendo 64 was a good system.

448
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:44,317
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was not.

449
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:45,498
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not a good system.

450
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:51,360
[SPEAKER_05]: The critical flaw they made in the system was that they refused to go to CD.

451
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,162
[SPEAKER_05]: That was one decision that fucking killed them.

452
00:32:56,783 --> 00:33:01,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Did developers manage to make great games with a mediocre system?

453
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:01,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

454
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,761
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you go to the GameCube.

455
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:14,589
[SPEAKER_05]: The GameCube wasn't a bad system, but the GameCube also made some key mistakes that I think make the GameCube not so great a system, honestly.

456
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:28,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there's Nintendo fanboys that are going to have their pitchfork and torches, but Nintendo 64, I think, made some key mistakes, and that was it didn't go online, it didn't play DVDs, which at the time that it came out was really an essential thing that the competitors had going.

457
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:33,842
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I do think the Wii is a great idea and a great system, and it's nice to see Nintendo kind of go in a different direction.

458
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:36,624
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would argue Nintendo 64 was not a good system.

459
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,526
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean the Nintendo GameCube?

460
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:40,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Both.

461
00:33:40,488 --> 00:33:42,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

462
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:43,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

463
00:33:44,111 --> 00:33:52,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Just they really – hopefully with the Wii, I hate going back – go online, Nintendo.

464
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:53,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, go online.

465
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Go online.

466
00:33:56,361 --> 00:34:01,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm giving them a chance because they're repeating their cycle of the DS which worked for them.

467
00:34:01,645 --> 00:34:04,687
[SPEAKER_05]: They're slowly, they're unboxing it slowly.

468
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:07,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Online will come into Nintendo in 08.

469
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,712
[SPEAKER_05]: You already see it starting to happen with Mario Kart and stuff.

470
00:34:12,072 --> 00:34:15,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like it did on the DS, Mario Kart launched the whole online thing on the DS.

471
00:34:16,195 --> 00:34:19,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, do I think they're behind?

472
00:34:19,618 --> 00:34:19,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

473
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:21,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I think their system is better than

474
00:34:24,108 --> 00:34:24,969
[SPEAKER_05]: at Microsoft.

475
00:34:25,089 --> 00:34:31,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly not, but it's better than nothing, which is pretty much what the GameCube had save one game.

476
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:32,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's more to the email.

477
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:33,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

478
00:34:34,435 --> 00:34:36,437
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, you guys are too self-depreciating.

479
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:41,300
[SPEAKER_02]: This show is ten times better than any other podcast I've listened to because your personalities work so well together.

480
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:48,905
[SPEAKER_02]: All the other podcasts just give me the straight news with limited opinions, which meticulously sidestep criticizing sponsors.

481
00:34:49,325 --> 00:34:53,108
[SPEAKER_02]: On OLR, I get my news mixed in with a little bit of Dirty Sanchez and Broadway show tunes.

482
00:34:53,922 --> 00:34:55,223
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are effing kick-ass.

483
00:34:55,323 --> 00:34:55,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Heon.

484
00:34:56,023 --> 00:34:59,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we didn't have any PlayStation 3 show tunes tonight amongst all those Sony news.

485
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:00,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe next week.

486
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:01,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

487
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:06,289
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know, but the... Remember the week we had the Sony was marketing with show tunes?

488
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:07,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this last week or two weeks ago?

489
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

490
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, forget it.

491
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:10,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

492
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:11,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and someone sent a spam, too.

493
00:35:12,672 --> 00:35:13,432
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't care, though.

494
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:14,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.

495
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like spam.

496
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:15,273
Um...

497
00:35:17,944 --> 00:35:19,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, appreciate the email.

498
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:25,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that we've just been doing this so long, we've almost become jaded to an extent, but in a good way, you know?

499
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:26,611
[SPEAKER_05]: We're honest.

500
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:29,794
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing this underground for a long time.

501
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:32,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Sponsors don't, we have to beg people to come on our show.

502
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:39,342
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't come knocking on our door like they do for the big box sites that have magazines and all that things attached to them.

503
00:35:39,742 --> 00:35:45,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I think that's what our listeners enjoy, the fact that we're pretty much just like you, only we have microphones.

504
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:48,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's pretty much it.

505
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:12,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

506
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:24,738
[SPEAKER_06]: But according to Electronic Entertainment Designer Research, they suggest that Xbox 360 Achievement Systems, called Accomplishments, I guess in the report, had an effect on the title's success.

507
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:35,540
[SPEAKER_06]: According to the press release, there is a strong connection between a game's title's diversity of accomplishment types and what the game's profitability was.

508
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't buy that one bit.

509
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it doesn't mean anything.

510
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:43,029
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, at least.

511
00:36:43,049 --> 00:36:47,571
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't think the achievement whores have enough of the market share?

512
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:52,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I think achievement points get people to buy games that they would not necessarily buy.

513
00:36:52,894 --> 00:37:05,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know, for example, I bought Xbox Live Arcade games thinking, oh, hey, I can get some pretty easy achievements off there, and I would buy them and then find out, yeah, they suck, and those achievements are a lot harder to get.

514
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that, if anything, I would think that the less achievements a game has, the better it'd sell.

515
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:19,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for achievement whores at least, because if there's one achievement to give me 1,000 points or something, all I do is beat the game.

516
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:26,303
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of the true achievement whores use Gamefly or one of those rental services anyway.

517
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:27,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Rent the game, get the points, send it back.

518
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:28,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

519
00:37:28,043 --> 00:37:29,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just a coincidence.

520
00:37:29,844 --> 00:37:34,445
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's just a trend that a lot of games are coming out and have more achievements.

521
00:37:34,545 --> 00:37:36,646
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

522
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:41,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool that the achievements are in there, but I don't think it really has anything to do.

523
00:37:41,582 --> 00:37:43,323
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

524
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

525
00:38:39,545 --> 00:38:42,646
[SPEAKER_02]: We were watching the Bollywood Awards last night.

526
00:38:42,706 --> 00:38:45,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we went to Indian Food today, actually, for lunch.

527
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:50,988
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a little Jamie Robb brunch at the Indian Food place, and they were watching some award, and they were doing some of the musicals.

528
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:51,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I got that guy's name.

529
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of it's catchy.

530
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that guy's name.

531
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:54,529
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

532
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:55,910
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that you got to see that performance.

533
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:56,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Akshay Kumar.

534
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, he is not in this game.

535
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:02,352
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sad, because that was a freaking good performance.

536
00:39:02,692 --> 00:39:02,972
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

537
00:39:03,012 --> 00:39:04,292
[SPEAKER_02]: But that would be cool.

538
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:06,993
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I would get that if we would get a release over here.

539
00:39:07,563 --> 00:39:08,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, who knows?

540
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:11,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Write some emails, make some demands.

541
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:12,668
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know what might happen.

542
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:19,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the full song list is floating around out there, but I do notice certain artists are repeated several times in the game.

543
00:39:20,494 --> 00:39:21,095
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out.

544
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:24,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I think those are the actual movies and not the artists.

545
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:26,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that would make sense.

546
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotcha.

547
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:28,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so these are the productions.

548
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:29,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

549
00:39:29,582 --> 00:39:32,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's quite a few there from Calho Naho, that movie.

550
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:47,026
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkTetsuya in chatroom says we need to import this game for Loki I don't know, Loki, feel like singing some Bollywood?

551
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:58,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like singing anything I'm actually posting that website to the chatroom because my impromptu website of the week alright, it lives

552
00:40:00,313 --> 00:40:07,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So at any rate, in other news, there is still going to be a Golden Axe update.

553
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:25,602
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be Golden Axe Beast Rider, which is exclusive for Xbox 360, and they are talking about them going to be a PS3 version, but it may not be the same one, but it's supposed to be a Golden Axe RPG.

554
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:30,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard that both of those games are coming out in the spring of next year.

555
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I think February or March.

556
00:40:32,468 --> 00:40:35,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that makes happy because I like Golden Axe.

557
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:39,330
[SPEAKER_06]: But I didn't see the Beast Rider thing on there or anything like that.

558
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,351
[SPEAKER_06]: But who knows?

559
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:43,431
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool at least.

560
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:47,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywho, so let's see here.

561
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:59,419
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some other interesting stuff that was floating around the web this week, including a mod for the PC version of Half-Life 2, which includes the Portal gun from, of course, Portal.

562
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:01,440
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks pretty awesome.

563
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:08,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, all the fun things you would imagine you can do with a Portal gun, including throwing grenades through it and whatnot.

564
00:41:08,243 --> 00:41:10,344
[SPEAKER_06]: But who knows?

565
00:41:10,444 --> 00:41:14,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we'll see some multiplayer mods for Portal as well.

566
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:17,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe an official release.

567
00:41:18,714 --> 00:41:20,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of love in our chat room, by the way.

568
00:41:20,435 --> 00:41:26,820
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed before the show started tonight, we had a lot of people in chat just spilling out their love for Portal, which is a game I have yet to play.

569
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:33,906
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to bring it over, Loki, because I don't want to spend all that money for the Orange Box, because I've been buying too many games lately.

570
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:40,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing against the folks at the Orange Box, but we need to share our resources here at Orange Lounge Radio.

571
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,112
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do want to play Portal.

572
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard a lot of good things about it.

573
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:43,280
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cake is a Lie

574
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:57,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

575
00:42:18,906 --> 00:42:22,450
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they've got Pokemon everything out there this day and age, right?

576
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:26,734
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got, you know, the Pokemon, obviously, look at my collection of stuffed animals up here.

577
00:42:26,774 --> 00:42:30,257
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got the Pokemon, the Pikachus I have, little stuffed Jigglypuffs.

578
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:35,242
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get them on mugs, shirts, hell, probably underoos with Pokemon on them too.

579
00:42:35,663 --> 00:42:39,406
[SPEAKER_05]: But now you can get Pokemon perfume.

580
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:41,208
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

581
00:42:41,656 --> 00:42:44,918
[SPEAKER_05]: You can smell like Pikachu, I guess.

582
00:42:45,498 --> 00:42:46,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Peek-a-poo!

583
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:51,241
[SPEAKER_05]: It's made by AirVal International is the name of the group that puts this out.

584
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,923
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll cost you $15 US.

585
00:42:54,123 --> 00:42:58,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do not buy this for your children because there's enough stinky perfume in the world, thank you.

586
00:42:59,926 --> 00:43:03,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish sometimes the internet had a scratch and sniff thing on it because I'm kind of curious.

587
00:43:03,688 --> 00:43:05,529
[SPEAKER_05]: What does Pikachu perfume smell like?

588
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,091
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably just some kind of generic scent.

589
00:43:08,531 --> 00:43:08,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

590
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:12,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that almost all perfume smells nasty, though, but I'm allergic to it.

591
00:43:12,842 --> 00:43:16,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, FootyMonster would like to point out, when I was a kid, you could get Transformers perfume, Skye.

592
00:43:17,004 --> 00:43:19,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that rare to see perfumes of the popular franchises.

593
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:21,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but still.

594
00:43:21,965 --> 00:43:22,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

595
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:24,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

596
00:43:24,706 --> 00:43:25,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Pikachu perfume?

597
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:27,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

598
00:43:28,628 --> 00:43:29,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

599
00:43:29,508 --> 00:43:31,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Son of Dad thinks they should make Pokemon Lube.

600
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:31,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

601
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:31,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Ew.

602
00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:33,549
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

603
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:34,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not want.

604
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not want.

605
00:43:35,959 --> 00:44:05,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Skype line is open for business 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio go ahead and give us a call and anything you want to talk about that we've talked about on this week's show or maybe there's a story that you want to talk about that we didn't get to tonight because actually in our choosing stories threads behind the scenes there's quite a lot of stories that didn't make the cut tonight I'm sure Loki will be getting to some of them though in last minute stories so Loki while we wait for some calls why don't we go over some last minute stories okay

606
00:44:06,129 --> 00:44:09,530
[SPEAKER_06]: There is one interesting thing, real briefly.

607
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:14,031
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a Mass Effect Limited Edition coming out.

608
00:44:14,231 --> 00:44:18,953
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only going to be available online, only through EB and GameStop, which is kind of weird.

609
00:44:19,673 --> 00:44:21,434
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I don't know.

610
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,454
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes out the same day, so November 20th.

611
00:44:25,515 --> 00:44:26,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

612
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:31,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there was some other stuff, I guess, coming from Nintendo Power.

613
00:44:32,057 --> 00:44:33,617
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Chris Slate

614
00:44:34,164 --> 00:44:43,692
[SPEAKER_06]: He was saying that there's going to be a brand new online community coming soon from Nintendo Power because, remember, they closed the Insider Forums at one time.

615
00:44:45,113 --> 00:44:53,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, another interesting thing from the Simpsons game, which is, of course, being put out by EA, Grand Theft Scratch is no more.

616
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:55,601
[SPEAKER_06]: They've made the change to name to Mob Rules now.

617
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:57,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So apparently those lawsuit things were working.

618
00:44:58,444 --> 00:44:58,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

619
00:44:59,224 --> 00:44:59,805
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

620
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:01,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I just lost the call.

621
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:03,107
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a call coming in on Skype and I missed it.

622
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:03,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

623
00:45:03,628 --> 00:45:03,708
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

624
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:04,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a story.

625
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:05,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sure, Jamie, real quick.

626
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:18,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Flint Dill, I guess that's how his last name is pronounced, was one of the writers for Riddick, and he's working on the Sin City game, and he and Frank Miller are working together on it.

627
00:45:18,187 --> 00:45:21,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And the quote says, Frank and I have been having a party coming up with nasty stuff for the game.

628
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:29,454
[SPEAKER_02]: In true Sin City fashion, some old characters will return, new characters will appear, and without giving anything away, probably die horribly.

629
00:45:30,307 --> 00:45:33,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know if the game is going to be anything like the movie.

630
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:35,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I will feel it is all style and no substance.

631
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:38,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a little bit of the movie, and I thought it was horrible.

632
00:45:38,852 --> 00:45:41,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Not my favorite movie in the world, but it's certainly pretty to look at.

633
00:45:41,593 --> 00:45:43,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we're finally getting some calls on the Skype line.

634
00:45:43,815 --> 00:45:44,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

635
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:45,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

636
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:46,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guys.

637
00:45:46,837 --> 00:45:47,237
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

638
00:45:47,457 --> 00:45:48,077
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Footy Monster.

639
00:45:48,257 --> 00:45:49,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Footy Monster.

640
00:45:49,078 --> 00:45:49,598
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

641
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:51,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too bad.

642
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:51,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too bad.

643
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,220
[SPEAKER_08]: What about you guys?

644
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed that last week you had quite a hectic show.

645
00:45:55,862 --> 00:45:57,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you sort it all out?

646
00:45:57,323 --> 00:45:58,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

647
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week's show was very interesting.

648
00:46:00,371 --> 00:46:03,253
[SPEAKER_05]: We had surprise guests, surprise outages.

649
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:07,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris was here, of course we love Chris, and Puppy was here, which was awesome.

650
00:46:08,276 --> 00:46:19,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had, you know, the show didn't get started for 40 minutes, or no, it was 20 minutes it took us to get the show started because two, I'm sorry, in our studio we used to have four mics.

651
00:46:20,546 --> 00:46:22,027
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

652
00:46:48,005 --> 00:47:12,758
[SPEAKER_05]: and so oh my gosh it was just horrible but we fixed it we went and we got a new cable and a new microphone and everything's hunky-dory again and we're up to four microphones which is going to be great for our guests so very happy and then of course our internet went out during part b so uh we had no live element last week which kind of sucked but then we did the operator 11 stuff the bonus show we did which was really cool by the way yeah we actually had a lot of fun doing it and we're kind of doing it again tonight

653
00:47:13,548 --> 00:47:18,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Even for the podcast listeners, if you go to Operator11.com a little later, you're actually going to see our Guitar Hero 3 preview.

654
00:47:18,712 --> 00:47:26,397
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to unbox the demo kit and show you guys the guitar and the changeable faceplate, and to show you guys all the insies and outsies of Guitar Hero 3 a little later on this evening.

655
00:47:26,497 --> 00:47:29,719
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those of you listening on the podcast, check that out at Operator11.com.

656
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll definitely be there checking it out.

657
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:32,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

658
00:47:33,321 --> 00:47:34,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that all you wanted to ask?

659
00:47:34,282 --> 00:47:34,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

660
00:47:34,842 --> 00:47:42,387
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I actually had a little comment from the dark side, because God might grab a little pause on Music Jam, Hamilton and Music Jam.

661
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:43,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what's up?

662
00:47:44,554 --> 00:47:46,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Good news for Loki, it is not that pink and fluffy.

663
00:47:46,977 --> 00:47:49,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, seriously?

664
00:48:04,725 --> 00:48:11,190
[SPEAKER_08]: The only time you see the face of the girl and all the pinkness is at the beginning, like you see the splash screen.

665
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:15,794
[SPEAKER_08]: But other than that, the game is pretty normal, low-key with the girliness.

666
00:48:15,954 --> 00:48:17,255
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess that's a good thing.

667
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:26,040
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's interesting is that the way it's set up, like, when you start the game, you don't have the freedom to choose, for instance, to play just the drums or to play just the bass guitar.

668
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,861
[SPEAKER_08]: You're supposed to make the song.

669
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:36,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So, because of that, you first have to play the lead guitar and, like, make the rhythm, which you can record, you have metronomes, so you can do everything.

670
00:48:36,465 --> 00:48:37,946
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really like jam sessions.

671
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:46,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you press the D-pad and you select the chords, you have a whole selection of chords, but you can't customize the chords like you can in jam sessions, so that's a

672
00:48:46,861 --> 00:48:48,922
[SPEAKER_08]: for jam sessions, but not for Hannah Montana.

673
00:48:49,703 --> 00:49:13,475
[SPEAKER_08]: But then once you're done recording your lead guitar, which it's not just strumming, you can also pick individual strings, which is pretty good, then you can record a bass with individual strings for strumming, you can record a guitar for little solos and stuff, and you can even do the whammy bar and all that stuff, so it's really interesting, it's really feature complete.

674
00:49:13,935 --> 00:49:15,156
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Drunk Kid,

675
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:20,635
[SPEAKER_08]: The drum kit you can play with two styluses if you want, so you have sort of like two little drumsticks.

676
00:49:21,015 --> 00:49:22,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you can use the whole DSL buttons.

677
00:49:22,897 --> 00:49:27,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Every button is signed for the drum stuff.

678
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:32,685
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can press B, and it does the big drum thingy.

679
00:49:32,725 --> 00:49:35,847
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you press the D-pad, it does the hi-hat and stuff like that.

680
00:49:36,448 --> 00:49:44,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there like a plot or a stage set up, or is it just like jam sessions where you just kind of rock out?

681
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:56,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but you know, it's funny that you can then take, like, your song, and there's an option to make it music video, which, it features Hannah Montana, you can change the camera around, make her play, make her dance around.

682
00:49:58,155 --> 00:50:05,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, seriously, I mean, it's like, it's a feature that's not there, which you might not like, but it's so much more feature-complete, I'm surprised.

683
00:50:05,721 --> 00:50:05,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

684
00:50:06,724 --> 00:50:18,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you've definitely become the unofficial spokesperson for the Hannah Montana franchise here on the show, so I'm curious to hear if some of our listeners actually go out and pick up this game and what they also think of it.

685
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:20,449
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only $20, though.

686
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:23,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only $20, so not too bad a bargain.

687
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:27,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hey, we've got to let you go to let some other folks on, but thank you so much for your call, and have fun with the Hannah Montana.

688
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:28,871
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

689
00:50:29,311 --> 00:50:30,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

690
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:30,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

691
00:50:32,608 --> 00:50:39,450
[SPEAKER_05]: If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

692
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:42,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, any more last minute stories over yonder, over hither?

693
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:45,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, some interesting things.

694
00:50:46,432 --> 00:50:52,433
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a new Logitech PC controller that apparently works perfectly on the PlayStation 3.

695
00:50:55,454 --> 00:50:56,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's kind of interesting.

696
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:59,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess a dual action gamepad is what it is.

697
00:50:59,827 --> 00:51:04,951
[SPEAKER_06]: But it works on the PlayStation 3, which is kind of surprising that a PC controller would work on it.

698
00:51:05,972 --> 00:51:09,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And then another thing, which is kind of funny you just mentioned it.

699
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:12,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Gran Turismo 5 is not really 1080p.

700
00:51:13,178 --> 00:51:14,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to another call.

701
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

702
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:15,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

703
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:17,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up?

704
00:51:17,122 --> 00:51:17,963
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Ryoma.

705
00:51:18,523 --> 00:51:19,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Ryoma.

706
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,064
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind, buddy?

707
00:51:21,626 --> 00:51:22,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing much.

708
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:26,470
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually something that I was kind of interested in asking you guys.

709
00:51:27,102 --> 00:51:30,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been passive on a Super Metroid care recently.

710
00:51:30,725 --> 00:51:33,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably one of my favorite Super Nintendo games.

711
00:51:33,908 --> 00:51:38,091
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, obviously one of the fascinations with the games is the speedrun element.

712
00:51:38,211 --> 00:51:41,854
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to know, like, what do you guys think of speedrun?

713
00:51:42,495 --> 00:51:44,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've ever heard you mention anything about it.

714
00:51:45,117 --> 00:51:47,459
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, what are your opinions on speedrunning in games?

715
00:51:48,228 --> 00:51:49,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, run that by me one more time.

716
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,329
[SPEAKER_05]: You said Super Metroid and what?

717
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:53,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're a little bit fuzzy.

718
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:55,570
[SPEAKER_05]: So say that again.

719
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,690
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to know our opinion on... Speedrunning.

720
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, speedrunning.

721
00:52:01,311 --> 00:52:02,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Speedrunning through the games.

722
00:52:02,971 --> 00:52:03,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

723
00:52:03,511 --> 00:52:04,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Speedruns are great.

724
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:06,172
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fun to watch on YouTube.

725
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:07,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not very good at it.

726
00:52:07,572 --> 00:52:08,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, that's not true.

727
00:52:09,052 --> 00:52:12,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, just for shits and giggles, played through Mario Bros.

728
00:52:12,413 --> 00:52:14,793
[SPEAKER_05]: like as fast as I freaking... I mean, Super Mario Bros.

729
00:52:14,813 --> 00:52:17,414
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously is as fast as I can just to kind of like...

730
00:52:17,762 --> 00:52:18,863
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

731
00:52:38,925 --> 00:52:40,646
[SPEAKER_02]: The 8-1 level of Super Mario Bros.

732
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:43,589
[SPEAKER_02]: blindfolded, that was during a speedrun.

733
00:52:43,949 --> 00:52:45,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's awesome.

734
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:57,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's because the whole level, if you don't, I mean, you can stop and try to get all the points, but if you're trying to have a full-time, well, it's close to a full-time by the time you get to the end of the thing, and not get hit by anything, it's a definite pattern to the whole level.

735
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was, it was during a speedrun that I did it blindfolded.

736
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:05,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably couldn't do it since, since I haven't touched the game in five years, but, you know.

737
00:53:06,314 --> 00:53:11,837
[SPEAKER_05]: and certainly a game like Super Metroid encourages you to do speedruns because you know you want the bra and panties shot at the end.

738
00:53:12,217 --> 00:53:15,559
[SPEAKER_05]: So in order to get that, you have to go through the game kind of as fast as you can.

739
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:28,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And some folks in chatroom getting in on the conversation as well, TigerClaw says, the thing about Metroid speedruns is they do a lot of sequence breaking, basically collecting all the items and powerups out of order.

740
00:53:28,485 --> 00:53:34,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing about the original Metroid as well, I know you don't have to have this item to beat the game, but it helps, but the screw attack...

741
00:53:35,228 --> 00:53:35,588
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not really.

742
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:38,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally think that speedrunning kind of takes the enjoyment out of the game.

743
00:54:03,402 --> 00:54:10,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I understand if, like, somebody loves a game to the point where they can just play through it really insanely quickly.

744
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:16,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I can do that with Mega Man X. I can beat Mega Man X when I was really good at it in about half an hour.

745
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:21,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to me it just kind of sucks the enjoyment out of the game.

746
00:54:21,503 --> 00:54:21,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

747
00:54:22,697 --> 00:54:23,737
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

748
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:48,860
[SPEAKER_05]: because there's different ways to play the game.

749
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:55,183
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also the complete anal retentive gameplay, which is me on any role-playing game.

750
00:54:55,323 --> 00:54:56,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I search everything.

751
00:54:56,904 --> 00:54:58,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I talk to everybody.

752
00:54:58,845 --> 00:55:10,951
[SPEAKER_05]: But I finish most of those games with some type of 100% completion or something like that because I'm so freaking anal retentive in my RPGs because I feel like I'm missing out on the story or I'm missing something important if I don't do it.

753
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:13,412
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's like the complete opposite of a speedrun.

754
00:55:13,693 --> 00:55:16,254
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's one way you can certainly enjoy a game as well, right?

755
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:20,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I understand that.

756
00:55:20,961 --> 00:55:22,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been one of those guys, personally.

757
00:55:22,963 --> 00:55:24,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're probably somewhere in the middle.

758
00:55:24,744 --> 00:55:25,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people are.

759
00:55:25,925 --> 00:55:26,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

760
00:55:27,287 --> 00:55:28,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, very cool.

761
00:55:28,848 --> 00:55:29,168
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

762
00:55:29,449 --> 00:55:32,291
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't talked about speedrunning a lot on the show, but there you go.

763
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:33,773
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we invite the calls.

764
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,215
[SPEAKER_05]: They get us to talk about things we may not normally talk about.

765
00:55:37,036 --> 00:55:38,957
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

766
00:55:39,538 --> 00:55:40,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one more thing.

767
00:55:40,659 --> 00:55:42,741
[SPEAKER_03]: For the love of God, don't buy boogies.

768
00:55:43,564 --> 00:55:44,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't buy Boogie.

769
00:55:44,705 --> 00:55:46,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Why should I stay the hell away from Boogie?

770
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:48,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a terrible game.

771
00:55:48,868 --> 00:55:50,109
[SPEAKER_03]: What about it is so terrible?

772
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:51,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, say that again?

773
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:53,412
[SPEAKER_05]: What about it is so terrible?

774
00:55:54,673 --> 00:55:56,194
[SPEAKER_03]: The karaoke is terrible.

775
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:58,816
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very simple game.

776
00:55:59,937 --> 00:56:01,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I found absolutely no enjoyment in it.

777
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:08,844
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, maybe there's some rhythm game, like super hardcore rhythm aficionado out there that'll love Boogie.

778
00:56:09,045 --> 00:56:12,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't, so... Or maybe a 12-year-old girl somewhere.

779
00:56:13,068 --> 00:56:13,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

780
00:56:13,812 --> 00:56:16,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob in our chat room agrees with you.

781
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:18,276
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, Boogie is a doorstop.

782
00:56:18,316 --> 00:56:19,377
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't adjust timing.

783
00:56:20,858 --> 00:56:21,678
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a doorstop.

784
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:22,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

785
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:23,780
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

786
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:27,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Ryoma, thanks so much for the call, and stay the hell away from Boogie, everybody.

787
00:56:29,265 --> 00:56:29,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.

788
00:56:29,705 --> 00:56:29,965
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

789
00:56:30,065 --> 00:56:30,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, buddy.

790
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:31,686
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

791
00:56:32,687 --> 00:56:33,088
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

792
00:56:33,168 --> 00:56:35,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So a very cold review for Boogie.

793
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,252
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, just be prepared.

794
00:56:38,612 --> 00:56:42,135
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to call in and tell us that a game sucks, we are going to ask you why.

795
00:56:42,614 --> 00:56:44,195
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68 When are you guys bringing back guys on the show?

796
00:57:12,276 --> 00:57:14,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Our spin-off show is on Orange Lounge Radio.

797
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:15,657
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very good question.

798
00:57:15,717 --> 00:57:16,697
[SPEAKER_05]: When are we bringing back?

799
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:20,058
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, our spin-off shows have been having a lot of trauma lately.

800
00:57:20,098 --> 00:57:24,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, Jamie's computer went poof, so that kind of screwed our Tuesday show.

801
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Extifer moved, which kind of screwed our Wednesday show.

802
00:57:27,421 --> 00:57:29,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Thursday show is still going, STFU.

803
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:31,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no.

804
00:57:32,262 --> 00:57:38,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, sometimes I drop by to listen to STFU, but, like, nothing happens.

805
00:57:38,264 --> 00:57:38,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-oh.

806
00:57:39,673 --> 00:57:45,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll have to get on our buddy up in Washington, Insanest, and see what's going on with that.

807
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say probably our weeknight shows are going to be in a bit of limbo.

808
00:57:50,723 --> 00:57:53,125
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just kind of focusing everything on the Sunday shows right now.

809
00:57:53,566 --> 00:58:05,597
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm hoping around the time when we can kind of re-energize our website, because our website's falling apart too, kind of around the same time we're able to give that a kick in the ass, which I'm hoping will be by year's end.

810
00:58:06,038 --> 00:58:06,638
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

811
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:31,981
[SPEAKER_02]: If I ever do.

812
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:33,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you do.

813
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:37,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And you also were tossing around, I don't know if I can even say, but there was another show idea.

814
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:39,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Working on it.

815
00:58:39,928 --> 00:58:40,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Working on it.

816
00:58:40,749 --> 00:58:46,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping 2008, in the early stages of that, we can really refocus.

817
00:58:46,954 --> 00:58:51,799
[SPEAKER_05]: But for right now, we're making sure our Sunday show is staying consistent and doing this.

818
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:53,500
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all we got.

819
00:58:54,902 --> 00:58:56,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides, I have a classroom...

820
00:58:58,105 --> 00:59:24,126
[SPEAKER_05]: 53645 and it takes me around 15 to 30 minutes to get back to my house from my campus so it's hard it'll be hard to catch guys on the show if I wanted to well I can tell you that the shows that don't use licensed music as a part of it may we may be looking into doing more podcasting you know STFU is being podcast for a little bit there we're thinking about it so it's very possible

821
00:59:24,878 --> 00:59:25,458
[SPEAKER_05]: You may see that.

822
00:59:25,698 --> 00:59:26,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can listen whenever you want.

823
00:59:27,579 --> 00:59:29,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Because hell, everybody podcasts these days.

824
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't listen to podcasts anymore.

825
00:59:33,421 --> 00:59:34,841
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the live experience better.

826
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:42,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree the live experience is ten times better, which is why we do this, and I think is part of what sets us apart from a lot of other folks that do this.

827
00:59:43,924 --> 00:59:50,827
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the live element is great, and I can't imagine doing a tape show, at least not right now.

828
00:59:51,447 --> 00:59:51,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

829
00:59:52,387 --> 00:59:52,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

830
00:59:52,767 --> 00:59:53,608
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a whole other challenge.

831
00:59:55,293 --> 01:00:02,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well GS68, thanks so much for the call and thanks for being such a fan of the station and calling us on our crap when we're missing out on the stuff we should be doing.

832
01:00:04,081 --> 01:00:04,541
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

833
01:00:04,621 --> 01:00:05,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, take care buddy.

834
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:06,843
[SPEAKER_05]: See ya.

835
01:00:07,043 --> 01:00:07,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye bye.

836
01:00:10,026 --> 01:00:11,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Our website does need some help badly.

837
01:00:12,908 --> 01:00:17,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember like a long time ago we got some offer from a website design company in our mailbag.

838
01:00:17,873 --> 01:00:18,653
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have taken it.

839
01:00:18,753 --> 01:00:19,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why we didn't.

840
01:00:20,874 --> 01:00:22,335
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura and Loki for all their help.

841
01:00:22,355 --> 01:00:22,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

842
01:00:49,205 --> 01:00:53,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see the phone ringing anymore, but let's see if there's any more last-minute stories, and I'll see if we get any other calls.

843
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:58,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, other fun stuff about that beautiful Katamari download content that we talked about earlier.

844
01:00:58,968 --> 01:01:00,108
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just keys.

845
01:01:00,188 --> 01:01:04,910
[SPEAKER_06]: All that info is already in the game, so you're just unlocking the ability to play it.

846
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:06,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray!

847
01:01:07,551 --> 01:01:10,812
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta love it when game companies do that.

848
01:01:11,012 --> 01:01:11,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what else.

849
01:01:12,372 --> 01:01:12,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's...

850
01:01:17,082 --> 01:01:21,945
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be some type of ban on being able to call that downloadable content.

851
01:01:21,985 --> 01:01:25,247
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not downloadable content when it's already on the disc.

852
01:01:25,347 --> 01:01:27,328
[SPEAKER_05]: That is unlocked content.

853
01:01:27,828 --> 01:01:29,529
[SPEAKER_05]: That is pay to unlock content.

854
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:34,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should start a movement that we are not going to refer to that stuff as downloadable content anymore.

855
01:01:35,453 --> 01:01:36,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's call it what it is.

856
01:01:36,413 --> 01:01:38,134
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pay to unlock content.

857
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, just wanted to start a revolution.

858
01:01:41,937 --> 01:01:42,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind me.

859
01:01:43,817 --> 01:01:44,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Rocket Whores

860
01:02:12,918 --> 01:02:26,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Laser Lovers, Children, Campers, Hip Slinging Snipers, Achievement Whores, Deserters, Heavy Brothers, and I guess that's it.

861
01:02:28,405 --> 01:02:28,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

862
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:32,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess that's... Oh, Heavy Breathers, my mistake.

863
01:02:32,647 --> 01:02:33,347
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes more sense.

864
01:02:34,088 --> 01:02:41,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's going to go ahead and do it for us tonight, wrap up, because we do want to get out of here at somewhat a reasonable hour because we're going to be doing the Guitar Hero 3 thing in a little bit.

865
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:44,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to wrap it up and say goodnight.

866
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:47,671
[SPEAKER_05]: But in order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.

867
01:02:48,591 --> 01:02:49,571
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start with Loki tonight.

868
01:02:49,611 --> 01:02:50,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought.

869
01:02:51,992 --> 01:02:55,953
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is there's a lot of games coming out soon.

870
01:02:56,833 --> 01:02:57,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I need more money.

871
01:02:58,693 --> 01:03:02,954
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is root beer is delicious, but root beer floats are even better.

872
01:03:03,484 --> 01:03:05,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, but Dole Whip floats are the best.

873
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:07,987
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

874
01:03:09,948 --> 01:03:10,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have one.

875
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:13,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Abstaining tonight from the final thought process.

876
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,650
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

877
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:14,891
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

878
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:15,571
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a free country.

879
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:16,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't have one.

880
01:03:16,952 --> 01:03:17,232
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

881
01:03:17,912 --> 01:03:18,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.

882
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:25,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you guys very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio by...

883
01:03:27,062 --> 01:03:27,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Checking us out.

884
01:03:27,683 --> 01:03:28,383
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

885
01:03:28,503 --> 01:03:31,465
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is the independent folks that keep us alive.

886
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:36,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you enjoy the show, tell two people that you enjoy the program.

887
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And we spread the word little by little and end up taking over the world.

888
01:03:40,613 --> 01:03:41,233
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

889
01:03:42,094 --> 01:03:43,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's it guys.

890
01:03:44,015 --> 01:03:44,836

891

[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

892
01:03:46,757 --> 01:03:48,299
