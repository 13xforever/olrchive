5500	11500	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com

15000	19500	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19500	25500	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, October the 21st, 2007.
25500	28500	And of course, Orange Lounge Radio does tape live on Sunday nights
28500	32000	and releases the live show in two parts, part A and B.
32000	36000	And you're listening to part B right now, which means we've already taken care of the formalities.
36000	39000	So let's get back to the gaming news.
39000	45000	So anyways, something we've been talking about for the last few weeks here is the Xbox 360 arcade SKU.
45000	47000	It doesn't exist, but it actually does.
47000	55000	Apparently, there has been some interesting proof for this, including someone actually buying one.
55000	57000	So, I mean, duh.
57000	63000	But, yeah, it is basically, you know, a core system now with a wireless controller.
63000	65000	It does have HDMI on it.
65000	75000	It will feature a 256 megabyte memory unit and a disk including five Xbox Live Arcade trial games, apparently.
75000	82500	Boom Boom Rocket, Feeding Frenzy, Luxor 2, and Pac-Man Championship and Uno.
82500	84000	That's fucking lame.
84000	86000	They're only trial games?
86000	87000	That does seem a little weird.
87000	90000	Has that been confirmed that they're actually just the trial games?
90000	92000	That kind of sucks a lot.
92000	96000	It says, let's see here, plus five trial games.
96000	100000	Box lists five games and it says plus five trial games.
100000	104000	So, oh, you get the console, the peripherals, plus these five trial games,
104000	109000	or you get the five full Xbox Liveware games plus five totally separate games.
109000	112000	I don't know, they didn't really say what it's on there, but...
112000	115000	Well, maybe if Microsoft will actually acknowledge the existence of this, then...
115000	117000	Can't we tell you this much, okay?
117000	121000	Not supposed to say anything, but it's going to be fucking announced on the 23rd, officially,
121000	122000	because that's the day it comes out.
122000	124000	Well, that's fine. This podcast won't hit till the 23rd for most people, so...
124000	127000	Yeah, it's coming out. It will be officially announced on the 23rd.
127000	131000	I don't know why, even after all this stuff, that they're still insisting on keeping it a fucking secret.
131000	136000	I mean, when people are leaking it out there, it's been purchased, it's been out there,
136000	140000	why they're still denying it's coming out, but they have a whole marketing plan behind it,
140000	141000	how they're going to promote it and stuff.
141000	144000	So, it will be officially announced on the 23rd.
144000	147000	What's so special about the 23rd?
147000	150000	It's whenever they're fucking... It's when this is coming out. I don't know why.
150000	151000	Okay.
151000	152000	What's so special about it?
152000	153000	Does it line up with an expo or something?
153000	155000	No, it's just whenever they feel like it.
155000	156000	Interesting.
156000	164000	And, I guess, I think also at the same time, that's when the elite bundle that they're doing for the holidays is coming out as well.
164000	169000	So, that's pretty much it.
169000	174000	Yeah. So, not a huge surprise.
174000	177000	It was totally not coming out or anything.
177000	180000	Well, back to the rumor camp.
180000	183000	And, you know, most Microsoft rumors do end up being true.
183000	186000	So, this could be something that does come to light.
186000	188000	Although, I don't know. This is a little bit far-fetched for me.
188000	190000	I forgot to mention, sorry, real quick.
190000	191000	Yes. No, that's all right.
191000	193000	It was confirmed by Microsoft.
193000	196000	They did confirm that it is coming.
196000	198000	They just never said anything else beyond that.
198000	200000	But, they're like, you just need to wait for details.
200000	205000	They're like, arcade for us is the ability to bring in a new set of audiences.
205000	207000	They're probably a little bit more casually focused.
207000	212000	And, they're looking for a new family experience and more price focused.
212000	219000	Robbie Bach told Financial Times, marking Microsoft's first public comments about the new SKU.
219000	223000	Of course, they didn't really say what was included with it or any of the details and stuff.
223000	232000	But, like I said, 23rd, all this will be finally officially announced and our Microsoft rep can finally calm down a little bit.
232000	236000	Well, this will be something that could bring people in.
236000	240000	And, that is combining the HD DVD player and the Xbox 360.
240000	243000	A lot of us have kind of wondered, why hasn't this been done already?
243000	251000	Well, there are rumors going around that Toshiba is actually teaming up with Microsoft to be making an actual HD DVD slash Xbox 360.
251000	259000	And, when I hear this, my mind kind of goes to, you remember the Panasonic Q, I think it was called, that was the GameCube slash DVD player that you could only get in Japan?
259000	260000	Yeah.
260000	261000	Right, is that what it was called, Jamie?
261000	266000	Didn't we see one of those once when we went to one of those import gaming stores, the Panasonic device that played the GameCube games?
266000	268000	I believe so.
268000	269000	Hmm, so.
269000	276000	Anyhow, Toshiba seems to be making something like that, I'm assuming, that combines HD DVD and Xbox 360.
276000	279000	The device supposedly will include an HD DVD player.
279000	294000	It is 1080p with HDMI, wireless networking, dual HD tuners with a program guide, an MP3 player dock, and possibly also a 40-inch TV to come with it or sold separately that will dock the actual 360.
294000	295000	Here's a funny thought.
295000	296000	Interesting.
296000	305000	Because I remember way back when they were talking about TVs that would have the original Xbox integrated into them as something like this.
305000	312000	How much do you want to bet this isn't actually a 360, it's a Toshiba HD DVD player that will also play Xbox 360 games?
312000	315000	That's kind of what the Panasonic Q was, right?
315000	317000	It was just a DVD player that would also play GameCube games.
317000	318000	Yeah.
318000	319000	It was kind of cool.
319000	320000	Sort of, yeah.
320000	324000	So anyway, here's why folks are getting all speculative about this.
324000	331000	Apparently an unnamed or unknown Toshiba rep actually said, an Xbox with a built-in DVD drive is critical.
331000	333000	They and we are working on it.
333000	336000	It also has to be more than a gaming machine.
336000	338000	Microsoft recognizes this.
338000	342000	A version of the device may also be sold under the Toshiba brand name.
342000	344000	Hmm.
344000	345000	Hmm.
345000	346000	That would make sense.
346000	349000	I mean, didn't we have a bajillion different versions of the CDI?
349000	350000	I suppose.
350000	351000	The 3DO, I'm sorry.
351000	358000	It is kind of interesting because I don't think we've seen anything really like this since the Panasonic Q.
358000	361000	And even then the Panasonic Q wasn't even sold here.
361000	363000	And here's the thing, too, about that.
363000	369000	That way if it is branded under the Toshiba name, when you have the Sony guy saying, hey, look at this.
369000	374000	See, this 360 is like $800 or something and it comes with all this stuff.
374000	377000	Well, you can get the PlayStation 3 and it does just as well.
377000	380000	Well, they can say, well, it's actually not an Xbox 360.
380000	383000	It just happens to play Xbox 360 games.
383000	386000	You know, kind of spin it that way, I guess.
386000	390000	But that's neat, I guess.
390000	391000	Hmm.
391000	396000	Let's hope the HD DVD ends up winning out because otherwise that's going to be a big pile of useless crap.
396000	402000	Well, at least there's quite a few movies already available, including Heroes Season 1, which I still need to buy on HD DVD.
402000	406000	I don't really care about HD DVD at all, though.
406000	408000	I have a Blu-ray player.
408000	410000	All right, lady.
410000	421000	So in other HD DVD news, you are also going to be given five free movies if you buy the Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on.
421000	437000	You can choose from Serenity, which is like the best movie ever, The Chronicles of Riddick, Hulk, Children of Men, The Fast and the Furious, Tokyo Drift, Troy, Full Metal Jacket, yeah, Corpse Bride, The Prestige, Swordfish, Black Rain, Dream Girls, and World Trade Center.
437000	447000	The way you claim this is you fill out a form, send in a copy of your barcode, and Microsoft will send you your stuff within 28 days.
447000	450000	Hey, wait, what if I bought mine like six months ago? Can I still cut out the barcode?
450000	451000	No.
451000	452000	Damn it.
452000	453000	You have to have a receipt.
453000	454000	Jerks.
454000	455000	Approve purchase.
455000	459000	Just for our friends in the UK, the add-on is 115 pounds.
459000	462000	And this is just starting in the UK right now.
462000	465000	They've been having something similar in the US since August.
465000	466000	Oh.
466000	468000	Still doesn't do me any good.
468000	470000	It's old, though. It will run until the end of January.
470000	471000	I was an early adopter.
471000	472000	Hey, Serenity.
472000	474000	I can understand how the iPhone folks feel.
474000	479000	That's true. Serenity is actually a movie I still need to get on HD DVD. I somehow don't have it yet.
479000	500000	It's kind of funny that you mentioned Heroes earlier because I believe that Best Buy is doing a thing right now where you can get a HD DVD add-on for the 360 and get a free copy of the Heroes HD DVD set, including also those five extra DVDs that you can mail away for.
500000	502000	Well, I just missed out on everything, didn't I?
502000	503000	Yeah.
503000	508000	Boy, early adopters really get screwed over sometimes.
508000	509000	Yeah, definitely.
509000	516000	Anyways, so other fun stuff to talk about here, including some download content that's going to be coming available.
516000	519000	Well, it is available right now in Japan for Beautiful Katamari.
519000	524000	And it's four different little pieces of download content, each 200 Microsoft points.
524000	534000	And they're four different levels, including the Milky Way Consolations, the Weaver Girl, Shopping Spree, and High-Calorie Katamari.
534000	544000	And basically what these are, the Milky Way Consolation has you roll up 88 constellations to create a new Milky Way.
544000	550000	The Weaver Girl, you roll up a huge ball of yarn and string to create Vega, the Weaver Girl.
550000	555000	And Shopping Spree, make a space station but be thrifty about it.
555000	563000	And I guess it sounds like an offshoot of a Katamari mission from one of the previous games where the value of items are collected and taken into account.
563000	568000	And High-Calorie Katamari, feed Cetus the Whale, roll up lots of food.
568000	574000	And that reminds me a little bit of the one from We Love Katamari where he rolled a sumo wrestler around East.
574000	575000	Oh yeah, that was cool.
575000	580000	So those are available right now in Asia and Japan, no word on the U.S. yet.
580000	583000	But I'm sure that they'll be coming soon.
583000	590000	Now I didn't mention this during my gaming week earlier in the show, but I did finally when I went out and bought the new microphone for the studio today.
590000	595000	I went out and bought a beautiful Katamari and played it for about five minutes.
595000	597000	So I'm not ready to give the game a full review yet.
597000	601000	Although I have heard a lot of folks have been saying it's awfully short, but we'll see.
601000	609000	But I just wanted to go and say, you know, despite all the controversy between us and that game, let it be known that OLR knows how to forgive.
609000	610000	I went out and bought the game anyway.
610000	615000	So when you look up forgiveness in the dictionary and see our picture next to it, you'll understand why.
615000	617000	Oh don't worry, I know how to forgive.
617000	619000	I went out and got the game as well.
619000	621000	All right, I'm sure you did.
621000	623000	All right.
623000	634000	I don't know if we'll be able to forgive the makers of this game though if it stinks and really devalues the value of the incredible series and miniseries behind it.
634000	637000	Of course I'm talking about Battlestar Galactica.
637000	640000	The game is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
640000	645000	Well you already knew that, that the game was coming and that you can play as Cylons, you can play as humans.
645000	651000	What you may not know is that the game is coming out this week, that's right, probably by the time most of you are hearing this podcast.
651000	654000	This game will be up on Xbox Live ready to download.
654000	658000	They're calling it a 3D space shooter played on a 2D plane.
658000	663000	Yeah, it sounds a lot like Wing Commander Arena.
663000	668000	And if I remember correctly, I think it's made by the same people too.
668000	670000	Great track record with that game.
670000	680000	We'll see. Just in time for the premiere of RZR, Battlestar Galactica RZR, of course the little miniseries about the Pegasus will be debuting November 24th.
680000	688000	Oh, by the way, for those folks that are asking how much the game will cost, such as JAP28 is asking in our chat room,
688000	697000	$20 on Xbox, I'm sorry, no, scratch that, $20 on the PC, 800 Microsoft Points or $10 on Xbox Live Arcade.
697000	702000	You can get it a day earlier on PCs, October 23rd, $20, not too shabby.
702000	707000	Joy. This is a little bit of joy, even though I'm probably not going to bother buying the game.
707000	715000	Sega Superstar Tennis is going to have, of course, a bunch of different Sega characters in it.
715000	720000	You have Sonic, you have Amigo from Samba de Amigo, which I think is pretty cool.
720000	729000	Ooh La La. It's being worked on by Sumo Digital. I'm not seeing anything else about who else is going to be in it,
729000	735000	or a date for that matter, but we do have it on PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Nintendo DS.
735000	742000	Please tell me that every time Ooh La La hits the ball, she'll go choo, choo, choo.
742000	743000	That would be good.
743000	745000	For those of you who play Space Channel 5, that's funny.
745000	750000	I do like what they mentioned on Kotaku, that they want to see characters from House of the Dead and Altered Beast. That'd be cool.
750000	751000	That would be kind of rad.
751000	754000	I want to play as a zombie. That'd just be awesome.
754000	757000	And then, like, when you win, you eat the other person?
757000	760000	Amazing Zombie Tennis, the game. That would be kind of fun.
760000	764000	We'll see. Are you listening, Sega? Make it happen.
764000	766000	I don't think that's going to happen.
766000	768000	I don't think so either, but it's going to be a dream.
768000	773000	Anyways, one thing that is happening, though, and also on the 23rd, will be Guitar Hero music,
773000	776000	available for download, at least a digital download,
776000	783000	including music from Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 2, and Guitar Hero Encore, Rock the 80s.
783000	789000	It will be available from Wave Group, and I guess affiliated with, you know, other stuff.
789000	797000	And it will be available, I guess, across such download sites as AOL, iTunes, Napster, Rhapsody, and Yahoo.
797000	802000	Somebody told me there's actually a DDR soundtrack on iTunes now for Supernova 2. I didn't even know that.
802000	803000	That's kind of neat.
803000	804000	I didn't know either, so.
804000	809000	We used to have our own little playlist uploaded on iTunes that had all the DDR music from the games
809000	813000	and where they could be found on iTunes, but I didn't bother to maintain it.
813000	818000	I think I updated it after last year's wave of games, and now there's just too many songs to keep track of.
818000	820000	iTunes has a lot now.
820000	826000	Anyhow, so I guess you can download that if you want to hear the Guitar Hero versions of songs,
826000	828000	which, you know, some of them are pretty good, not too shabby.
828000	833000	Maybe we'll put some of them on Rotation in our regular 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week program
833000	836000	on orange.traded.com with the gaming music.
836000	840000	And hopefully the music won't stop like E for All did when the power...
840000	844000	Somebody forgot to pay the bill at E for All and the power got shut off.
844000	846000	No, just kidding. That's not the reason why.
846000	854000	But on Friday night at about 7 o'clock, E for All came to a very abrupt end because the lights went out.
854000	861000	A lot of folks were watching a match between Fatality, he was playing Quake 4,
861000	865000	and some other folks were playing Super Mario Galaxy and some of the other games that were available there,
865000	869000	and then the power shut off on the whole right half of South Hall,
869000	872000	and that would have been where the Nintendo and the EA booths were,
872000	877000	which were pretty much the main reasons why people were going to the show right there between those two,
877000	880000	and so they decided to end the show at that point.
880000	884000	The staff quickly escorted everybody out of the convention hall
884000	886000	because when the power goes out, that's actually not safe.
886000	888000	So, safety hazard.
888000	889000	Money back!
889000	890000	Refund.
890000	894000	I know, but wasn't the show going to close at like 8 anyway?
894000	896000	I don't know. I don't remember the hours for the show,
896000	899000	but I seem to recall it was going to close kind of early anyway.
899000	903000	And by the way, this isn't the first time something like this has happened at the convention center.
903000	907000	There have been some previous E3s where similar things have happened,
907000	913000	but it just kind of sucks that it's happening to E4ALL when they're kind of...
913000	917000	They've been taking a lot of crap from various game blogs and stuff
917000	922000	for not being up to the same level that many of us remember with the big E3 expos,
922000	926000	so this doesn't help them try to get past that.
926000	928000	You know what I mean?
928000	930000	Sorry, E4ALL.
930000	932000	No, you're not.
932000	934000	You're just saying that.
934000	935000	Alright, I am.
935000	937000	Okay.
937000	942000	The PS3 is actually seeing an increase in sales in Europe now.
942000	949000	They have gone up by 178%.
949000	952000	Wow.
952000	959000	But that's with the introduction of the 60GB bundle and the new 40GB unit that came out.
959000	961000	Was there a price drop that just went in there?
961000	963000	Oh, yes, there was a price drop that happened too recently.
963000	965000	Yep, there was.
965000	967000	And I'm sure there may be...
967000	972000	They also were saying that the software sales increased with a Resistance Fall of Man
972000	977000	actually taking a rise in its chart status
977000	981000	and Heavenly Sword and Motorstorm.
981000	984000	Those are kind of the must-have PS3 games at this point,
984000	989000	so not too surprising that folks getting their new PS3s are picking up those games.
989000	991000	That makes sense to me.
991000	998000	Anyways, oh my God, they totally announced the 40GB system for the US.
998000	1000000	I'm so shocked.
1000000	1003000	I did not realize that that was coming.
1003000	1005000	Holy crap.
1005000	1006000	You're the worst liar ever.
1006000	1007000	Holy crap.
1007000	1008000	I know.
1008000	1009000	So much enthusiasm.
1009000	1012000	Yeah, so Sony finally announced this system.
1012000	1016000	They have really done a great job of keeping it under wraps.
1016000	1018000	No one knew anything about it.
1018000	1021000	Apparently, yeah, it's coming out now November 2nd.
1021000	1025000	It'll officially be $400 US for $399.99, however you want to look at it.
1025000	1031000	And, of course, there is no backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 games.
1031000	1037000	And at the same time, they've also dropped down the 80GB system to $499.99,
1037000	1041000	so $100 cheaper.
1041000	1042000	Awesome.
1042000	1046000	Well, one thing that's kind of been pissing people off about these new systems,
1046000	1051000	the 40GB system, of course, removes completely the backwards compatibility of the PlayStation 2 games.
1051000	1052000	You cannot play them.
1052000	1058000	And the Wall Street Journal actually interviewed Sony Computer Entertainment boss Jack Trenton
1058000	1061000	on the whole issue about the backwards compatibility.
1061000	1067000	And what he said is that this has nothing to do with reducing Sony's cost of manufacturing.
1067000	1073000	People would go and speculate that, oh, they had to fit a whole PlayStation 2 in the PlayStation 3,
1073000	1074000	so taking that out saves them money.
1074000	1075000	Nope.
1075000	1077000	The reason why they did this was, quote,
1077000	1085000	encouraging buyers of the entry-level PlayStation 3 to purchase more games designed specifically for the new system.
1085000	1088000	You are an idiot.
1088000	1089000	I'm sorry.
1089000	1091000	That was horrible.
1091000	1093000	Lie. Lie to them, people.
1093000	1096000	Seriously, don't go, oh, I'm sorry, we took it out just to fuck you over.
1096000	1098000	So, I mean, you've lied to them.
1098000	1102000	You say, yes, we did the same cost, and people, oh, okay.
1102000	1109000	And if they don't want to spend the money, they can go buy the 80-gig system for some more money.
1109000	1114000	But seriously, you don't go, no, I'm sorry, we really didn't take it out just to save money.
1114000	1118000	Sure, we saved a little bit of money, but really it was just to fuck you guys over.
1118000	1120000	I mean, come on.
1120000	1121000	Who let him talk?
1121000	1123000	Seriously, who let him talk?
1123000	1126000	I think Pekor Uno in our chat room would agree with you.
1126000	1127000	chat.orangelandstrator.com.
1127000	1131000	Pekor Uno says, Sony PR, please shut the fuck up.
1131000	1133000	Please, please, please.
1133000	1134000	Come on.
1134000	1136000	Who let him talk?
1136000	1137000	That's all I want to know.
1137000	1145000	I mean, you don't, I'm sorry, I try to be as positive as I can with these guys, but they're really making it tough on me.
1145000	1148000	I mean, seriously.
1148000	1153000	I thought they just came out the week before and said, okay, well, the reason why is because we removed these chips,
1153000	1158000	and we removed these chips so that we can cut the price a little bit so that we could drop the price of the system.
1158000	1166000	Okay, that makes sense in logic there, but if you're just fucking with us and just removing it because you want to sell some more PlayStation 3 games,
1166000	1168000	well, then fuck you.
1168000	1169000	I mean, seriously.
1169000	1172000	Interesting thought in our chat room.
1172000	1181000	Rob Babak says in our chat room, or it could be that Sony wants you to buy backwards compatibility from the PlayStation Network.
1181000	1183000	Oh, wouldn't that be mean?
1183000	1185000	That's really mean if that's true.
1185000	1189000	But they have said it's software-based. That is definitely plausible.
1189000	1193000	No, because it's software-based for the PlayStation 1.
1193000	1201000	What it was is they had a chip that was running the graphics stuff for the PlayStation 2, but the emotion engine was software-based.
1201000	1204000	So unless they completely rewrote it to...
1204000	1209000	But then they get rid of, like in the European ones, didn't they get rid of that and replace it with software?
1209000	1214000	Yeah, they got rid of one of the two chips, but this 40 gig system has zero of the two chips.
1214000	1216000	So that's why I can't run anything.
1216000	1219000	It's all fucked up, however you look at it.
1219000	1224000	I mean, if they're going to make you buy backwards compatibility later on, that's also fucked up.
1224000	1229000	That's just asking for Microsoft to just come back at you with some PR spin on it.
1229000	1230000	I mean, seriously.
1230000	1232000	I'm glad I bought mine when I did.
1232000	1236000	Some days I want to go just cut your losses and let's hear about PlayStation 4.
1236000	1239000	It really, I mean...
1239000	1240000	It's getting harder.
1240000	1243000	I'm sorry, Sony fanboys, but at the same time, I'm not.
1243000	1248000	It's like, you know, they just don't make...
1248000	1251000	They don't make a good case right about now, you know what I mean?
1251000	1254000	They just keep shooting themselves in the foot over and over and over.
1254000	1257000	There's nothing, I mean, honestly, I'm...
1257000	1262000	For the last few weeks, I've been really questioning whether I want to get Ratchet & Clank Future because I haven't paid for it.
1262000	1265000	I'm just like, eh, maybe I want something else instead.
1265000	1268000	I can buy a 360 game with that or something.
1268000	1276000	It's just, I don't know, I've been downloading stuff off the Japanese PlayStation Network.
1276000	1279000	They actually have some stuff to download on there.
1279000	1283000	On the bright side, maybe the price will drop again before Final Fantasy 13 comes out.
1283000	1284000	I can dream.
1284000	1285000	You know what?
1285000	1286000	Yeah, seriously.
1286000	1287000	When?
1287000	1288000	Well, what?
1288000	1292000	Final Fantasy 13 will probably come out in Japan late next year.
1292000	1293000	It'll be 2009 at the earliest.
1293000	1295000	You'll be lucky if it comes out next year.
1295000	1296000	Yeah, I know.
1296000	1297000	You'll be lucky.
1297000	1298000	I know.
1298000	1299000	Well, that's...
1299000	1300000	Maybe there will be another price drop before that.
1300000	1301000	I'm not holding my breath.
1301000	1302000	Who knows?
1302000	1303000	I don't know.
1303000	1304000	Me neither.
1304000	1305000	I got stuff to play on other systems, meanwhile.
1305000	1306000	It's fine.
1306000	1310000	Well, at least the few things are going to be on PlayStation Network.
1310000	1312000	There's Flow and Warhawk.
1312000	1314000	Flow is spelled with a zero.
1314000	1316000	It's Leet.
1316000	1318000	Well, it's the way the game is.
1318000	1319000	Yeah.
1319000	1320000	It looks very...
1320000	1321000	It looks kind of electroplanktony.
1321000	1323000	Are you saying the game is a zero?
1323000	1324000	No, I like the game.
1324000	1325000	I like the game.
1325000	1327000	It's the only game I've bought from PlayStation Network.
1327000	1331000	Well, these are expansions that are going to be out for there.
1331000	1339000	The Flow expansion is going to have a multiplayer mode and a new playable creature, and then
1339000	1346080	Warhawk is going to be another dropship, and you can pick up and relocate ground vehicles.
1346080	1351000	Multiplayer on Flow could be interesting, even though wasn't Flow more of like an experience
1351000	1353000	than a game, so to say?
1353000	1354000	It puts you to sleep.
1354000	1355000	It does.
1355000	1356000	It's soothing.
1356000	1357000	It's very soothing.
1357000	1358000	It looks pretty.
1358000	1364000	You tilt the controller around and eat shit, and it is a pretty-looking game, but it's
1364000	1368880	like something that you would see at a rave or something where they're playing chill-out
1368880	1375080	music and just watching some of the pretty colors and the soothing music.
1375080	1376080	It's ambient.
1376080	1377200	I don't know.
1377200	1380280	These minimalist games, though, sometimes are extremely popular.
1380280	1384960	If you think about it, every Xtreme, which I was talking about earlier, there's one button
1384960	1386960	in the game to blow up your ship.
1386960	1387960	Exactly.
1387960	1390600	I don't have a problem with that game.
1390600	1392880	That's why I bought Flow.
1392880	1393880	That says a lot.
1393880	1398960	Because buying stuff off of the PlayStation Network is a bitch, and I don't like doing
1398960	1401640	it, so Flow is good.
1401640	1406360	Kiki in our chat room says, screw Flow, get Everyday Shooter, which is a game I've heard
1406360	1407360	good things about.
1407360	1411560	But Everyday Shooter wasn't available when Flow first became available, so, you know.
1411560	1415600	But yeah, I've thought about buying that game too, because that looks good.
1415600	1420120	Anyways, another game, as I mentioned earlier, that I tried out, and it is available on the
1420120	1426120	Japanese PlayStation Network, so if you don't have a Japanese account, create one, download
1426120	1430700	it, and then you can play it on any of your accounts, but it's Gran Turismo 5 Prologue,
1430700	1432020	the demo.
1432020	1436080	So it's a demo for a demo, I guess, or a demo for a demo game that you're going to have
1436080	1437800	to buy or something like that.
1437800	1446140	Anyways, it features a few cars, I believe there's like, I want to say, like six cars
1446140	1449820	to choose from or something in the very beginning.
1449820	1456300	And there's going to be single player stuff, no online.
1456300	1459900	It's a cool looking game, I think there's like one track.
1459900	1461320	Definitely worth checking out.
1461320	1464920	Personally, though, when this comes out, I wouldn't buy it.
1464920	1468060	But hey, if you love Gran Turismo, get your hands on it.
1468060	1470400	What about the full game when it's released?
1470400	1472140	I wouldn't buy it.
1472140	1475440	It's going to be, they're talking $40 for the full game.
1475440	1478480	Fuck that, I'll wait for the real game to come out and pay like $20 more.
1478480	1481020	I mean, what's the point?
1481020	1487160	And also, the other thing too is, make sure you download Gran Turismo HD if it's still
1487160	1491560	available on the PlayStation Network, because I know that they're taking that down soon
1491560	1494760	when 5 comes out.
1494760	1495760	But definitely worth checking it out.
1495760	1499000	It's a cool looking game, just wouldn't buy it.
1499000	1500000	All right.
1500000	1506400	Well, a very interesting comment coming out of the San Jose Mercury News, Dean Takahashi
1506400	1510440	is a reporter for the Mercury News and talks often about video games.
1510440	1516080	And he was writing earlier this week about the latest sales number, and also said this
1516080	1520740	quote, quote, one piece of news that came out this week was that Sony pleaded with third
1520740	1525120	party developers not to abandon its struggling platform.
1525120	1530680	That change in attitude is a marked difference compared to the arrogance of past years.
1530680	1535360	Very interesting to think that Sony could be on its knees begging people not to leave
1535360	1536360	right now.
1536360	1538680	It kind of makes me go, I wonder who's thinking of jumping ship right now.
1538680	1539680	Well, it makes sense.
1539680	1541440	I mean, if you think about it, I mean, look at it.
1541440	1546480	The system has the least amount of, as far as, I hate calling it next gen, but as far
1546480	1553320	as the next gen platforms, it has the least market share, at least in the US, and it's
1553320	1556540	more expensive to develop for and it takes a lot longer to develop for.
1556540	1560280	Why would you spend the extra money and time to develop a game for the PlayStation 3 when
1560280	1564480	you can equally do it for the Xbox 360 and be able to sell more units?
1564480	1567780	I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
1567780	1570400	So I don't know, I'm not surprised.
1570400	1574280	And I wish they had done it sooner because now they're just pissing people off.
1574280	1577360	Keep in mind there's some developers out there that have really strongly voiced an opinion
1577360	1578760	about the PlayStation 3.
1578760	1584640	One of the folks at Valve said the PlayStation 3 was a waste of everyone's time and could
1584640	1590840	be indicating why folks are starting to jump ship and Sony's begging people to stay around.
1590840	1594720	Speaking of which, Half-Life 2, the orange box on PlayStation 3 not coming out until
1594720	1597440	December now.
1597440	1603880	And as some folks are speculating, if at all, if you keep getting delay, delay, delay, eventually
1603880	1609400	you might start seeing cancelled, cancelled, cancelled, I think this holiday season could
1609400	1610400	make or break Sony.
1610400	1614800	I don't want to sound all like finalists here, but if Sony doesn't manage to sell through
1614800	1618600	a lot of consoles, it's interesting because Extrofer and I, for those who didn't hear
1618600	1622600	the bonus segment tonight, Extrofer and I drove to Disneyland together and we were talking
1622600	1623600	about game stuff.
1623600	1629440	He works at a large retail chain right now that sells electronics as a part of it and
1629440	1635960	he says, he's like, I'm not biased, but I'm sitting there and I'm watching, we are selling
1635960	1642800	quite a few Xbox 360, tons of Wii's, I have never, now keep in mind he works overnights,
1642800	1647360	but he sees these systems go even in the overnight shifts and he says, I have never seen us sell
1647360	1649000	a PlayStation 3.
1649000	1654760	Well Walmart's kind of a weird demographic, I mean I don't think people go buy PlayStation
1654760	1656760	3's there.
1656760	1663240	The thing, I mean seriously though, I'm just taking it right now as to date, and I was
1663240	1666600	talking to you about this before the show started because kind of going back to the
1666600	1670800	whole Eye of Judgment bet that we have right now so far and I was looking at the numbers
1670800	1677200	after the MPD group reported on for September, year to date the PlayStation 3, there's not
1677200	1682800	been a game that's sold over 400,000 units in the United States, which isn't that great.
1682800	1687000	I mean when you consider like Halo sold 2 million units and there's a bunch of other
1687000	1693640	games that have sold millions of units and stuff like that, 300,000 or 335,000 if I remember
1693640	1700120	correctly was for Resistance Fall Man, it's not that good.
1700120	1704320	And I know people are waiting for Metal Gear Solid 4, which is going to be an awesome game,
1704320	1708240	you know, and that will be probably a must have game for the PlayStation 3, may help
1708240	1713840	them sell some units, but I think a lot of people in hope to God that they don't announce
1713840	1719320	that there's going to be an Xbox 360 version for that around the same time, you know, I
1719320	1723680	think that may sell some units for them, but at the same time there's not, they're going
1723680	1730260	to lose out this holiday for sure, that's a fact, and by the time that all these good
1730260	1736000	games come around it's going to be too late, that's really what it's going to be, so.
1736000	1740920	Hope they make it, I mean, because I'd like to see all three consoles doing good, but.
1740920	1749400	I don't know, I don't know, alright, yet again, another Sony debate here on the program, hey
1749400	1752800	we love to always get your perspective, I'm sure there's some people that feel very differently
1752800	1759440	about this whole issue, Mailbag at OrangeHonorTrader.com is the place to express your opinion, and
1759440	1763140	every week here on the program we like to read your emails here on the program and respond
1763140	1768840	to them if appropriate, so DarkSakura likes to read the emails at Mailbag at OrangeHonorTrader.com
1768840	1771520	in our Mailbag segment.
1771520	1781160	From what I understand this week, not a lot of people expressing their opinions, huh?
1781160	1782160	No.
1782160	1783160	That's too bad.
1783160	1788920	Um, first email says, hey I'd really like the new segment and I think it's fun to reminisce
1788920	1794680	on old but great games, I would actually like to request a game to be featured in this segment,
1794680	1802480	Ristar for the Sega Genesis, it's one of my all time favorites, thanks, that's from Osprey.
1802480	1806960	Maybe one day, I didn't really play it that much.
1806960	1808520	Well maybe now's the time to start.
1808520	1812880	I already have a game picked up for next week, although it's really really really obscure.
1812880	1815720	What happens when you're out in November, does that mean Loki and I get to pick some
1815720	1816720	games?
1816720	1817720	Sure.
1817720	1820240	Actually, I'll go ahead and tell you the one I thought about doing next week that I'm not
1820240	1826080	going to do was Kaze No Regret, the real sound game that came out on the Saturn that was
1826080	1829280	sound only and you got a packet of seeds with it.
1829280	1831360	Are we going to be seeing nothing but Sega games?
1831360	1832360	No.
1832360	1833360	Alright, good.
1833360	1836400	I have been doing Sega games lately, haven't I?
1836400	1837480	Yeah, you have.
1837480	1839320	You're eating some joke over there, Loki.
1839320	1840320	What is-
1840320	1844160	No, I was just thinking of classic games, well, they're not exactly classic games, but
1844160	1847360	games I was thinking only I would pick-
1847360	1848360	Gals panic.
1848360	1849360	Gals panic is good.
1849360	1850360	Don't get me wrong.
1850360	1851360	Okay.
1851360	1852360	Well, let's not ruin it.
1852360	1853360	This week.
1853360	1854360	I was going to say like BMX sure blacks.
1854360	1855360	Define classic.
1855360	1856360	It's classy.
1856360	1859360	It's a classy game.
1859360	1860360	Alright.
1860360	1864800	Yeah, Dark Soccer is going to be on vacation a couple weeks in November, but we'll cross
1864800	1866360	that bridge when we get to it.
1866360	1871320	The last email is, dear OLR, this is a theory that has been floating around the internets
1871320	1874240	for some time, the third console curse.
1874240	1879280	Basically, this theory states that every third console by every leading publisher will ultimately
1879280	1882640	fail or do significantly less better than its predecessor.
1882640	1883640	Just think about it.
1883640	1885920	The Atari 5200 was Atari's third system and it failed.
1885920	1886920	No, it didn't.
1886920	1892040	The Sega Saturn was Sega's third home system and it slowly died because producing its motherboard
1892040	1893040	was so expensive.
1893040	1896280	Well, also, they didn't really support it very well in the US.
1896280	1902200	The Nintendo 64 did not fare well due to Sony's more powerful system and CD-based media.
1902200	1903200	That's true.
1903200	1907560	And lastly, Sony and its PlayStation 3, which I need not explain, especially since we just
1907560	1911920	went over it, although the N64 and Saturn were pretty awesome systems, you can't help
1911920	1916120	but say they did fail to their rival systems in terms of sales.
1916120	1922200	I know that this argument has no base whatsoever, but I just wanted to throw this out.
1922200	1928200	Technically, the Saturn was not the third system.
1928200	1934400	The Saturn was the Master System, Genesis, Sega CD, 32X, and then the...
1934400	1939360	Well, 32X, I wouldn't really call a system, is more of an add-on, but still, it's not
1939360	1940360	the third system.
1940360	1941360	Fourth, fifth.
1941360	1945160	So, yeah, that doesn't really count.
1945160	1946160	I don't know.
1946160	1947720	I kind of want to say something controversial.
1947720	1948720	I don't know.
1948720	1953000	I'll tell you why they all failed because they all appeared on the cover of Madden NFL.
1953000	1955160	That's why they all failed.
1955160	1959640	No, the controversial thing I want to say, our emailer says the Nintendo 64 was a good
1959640	1961040	system with the Saturn.
1961040	1962040	I disagree.
1962040	1963600	I don't think the Nintendo 64 was a good system.
1963600	1964600	No, it was not.
1964600	1967240	It was not a good system.
1967240	1972000	The critical flaw they made in the system was that they refused to go to CD.
1972000	1976920	That was one decision that fucking killed them.
1976920	1982160	Did developers manage to make great games with a mediocre system?
1982160	1983560	Yes.
1983560	1984800	And then you go to the GameCube.
1984800	1991200	The GameCube wasn't a bad system, but the GameCube also made some key mistakes that
1991200	1994680	I think make the GameCube not so great a system, honestly.
1994680	1998160	And I know there's Nintendo fanboys that are going to have their pitchfork and torches,
1998160	2002720	but the Nintendo 64, I think, made some key mistakes, and that was it didn't go online.
2002720	2007400	It didn't play DVDs, which at the time that it came out, it was really an essential thing
2007400	2009000	that the competitors had going.
2009000	2012800	However, I do think the Wii is a great idea and a great system, and it's nice to see Nintendo
2012800	2013800	kind of go in a different direction.
2013800	2016600	But I would argue that Nintendo 64 was not a good system.
2016600	2019040	You mean the Nintendo GameCube?
2019040	2020040	Both.
2020040	2021040	Yeah.
2021040	2029560	Um, I don't know, it's just, they really, hopefully, you know, with the Wii, I hate
2029560	2036280	going back, you know, go online Nintendo, seriously, go online, and uh...
2036280	2041200	I'm giving them a chance because I see, they're repeating their cycle of the DS, which worked
2041200	2042200	for them.
2042200	2046080	They're slowly, they're unboxing it slowly.
2046080	2049280	Online will come into Nintendo in 08.
2049280	2052880	You already see it starting to happen with Mario Kart and stuff, just like it did on
2052880	2053880	the DS.
2053880	2058840	Mario Kart launched the whole online thing on the DS, so, I mean, do I think they're
2058840	2059840	behind?
2059840	2060840	Yes.
2060840	2065380	Do I think they're, you know, do I think their system is better than Microsoft?
2065380	2070480	Certainly not, but, um, it's better than nothing, which is pretty much what the GameCube had
2070480	2071480	save one game.
2071480	2072480	Yeah.
2072480	2073480	Well, there's more to the email.
2073480	2074480	Sorry.
2074480	2075480	Okay.
2075480	2076480	By the way, you guys, you're too self-depreciating.
2076480	2080320	This show is ten times better than any other podcast I've listened to because your personalities
2080320	2082260	work so well together.
2082260	2087000	All the other podcasts just give me the straight news with limited opinions, which meticulously
2087000	2089320	sidestep criticizing sponsors.
2089320	2093960	On OLR, I get my news mixed in with a little bit of Dirty Sanchez and Broadway show tunes.
2093960	2095240	You guys are effin' kickass.
2095240	2096240	Hee-on.
2096240	2100520	Aw, we didn't have any PlayStation 3 show tunes tonight amongst all those Sony news.
2100520	2101520	Maybe next week.
2101520	2102520	We'll see.
2102520	2106280	No, I know, but the, remember the week we had the Sony was marketing with show tunes?
2106280	2108160	Was this last week or two weeks ago?
2108160	2109160	Anyway.
2109160	2110160	Ah, forget it.
2110160	2111160	Thank you.
2111160	2112160	Oh, and someone sent us spam too.
2112160	2114160	We don't care though.
2114160	2115160	Hooray.
2115160	2117160	We don't like spam.
2117160	2118800	Um, thanks.
2118800	2119800	Appreciate the email.
2119800	2122800	Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that we've just been doing this so long, we've almost
2122800	2127260	become jaded to an extent, but in a good way, you know, we're honest.
2127260	2130480	We've been doing this underground for a long time.
2130480	2133480	News don't, we have to beg people to come on our show.
2133480	2137480	People don't come knockin' on our door like they do for the big box sites that have magazines
2137480	2139840	and all that things attached to them.
2139840	2141720	And honestly, I think that's what our listeners enjoy.
2141720	2146080	The fact that we're pretty much just like you, only we have microphones.
2146080	2148720	I guess that's pretty much it.
2148720	2152600	So anyhow, let's move on.
2152600	2153600	Shall we?
2153600	2154600	Back to the news.
2154600	2155680	Mailbagorangeontrader.com.
2155680	2156680	Send more emails.
2156680	2158000	Two emails all week?
2158000	2159120	That's sad, folks.
2159120	2160760	You make me sad.
2160760	2167920	You know what's sad is that people think that an Xbox 360 game with more achievements equals
2167920	2170320	better reviews and more sales.
2170320	2176840	I don't understand, I don't know, but according to Electronic Entertainment Designer Research,
2176840	2182840	they suggest that Xbox 360 achievement systems, called accomplishments, I guess in the report,
2182840	2186120	had an effect on the title's success.
2186120	2189280	According to the press release, there is a strong connection between a game's title's
2189280	2196560	diversity of accomplishment types and what the game's profitability was.
2196560	2198600	I don't buy that one bit.
2198600	2203800	I mean, it doesn't mean anything, to me at least.
2203800	2204800	I don't see why...
2204800	2208560	You don't think the achievement whores have enough of the market share that...
2208560	2213040	I think achievement points get people to buy games that they would not necessarily buy.
2213040	2218720	I know, for example, I bought Xbox Live Arcade games thinking, oh, hey, I can get some pretty
2218720	2223840	easy achievements off there, and I would buy them and then find out, yeah, they suck and
2223840	2225680	those achievements are a lot harder to get.
2225680	2231080	I don't think that, if anything, I would think that the less achievements a game has, the
2231080	2235840	better it'll sell, well, for achievement whores at least, because if there's one achievement
2235840	2239960	to give me 1,000 points or something, all I do is beat the game.
2239960	2246480	But a lot of the true achievement whores use Gamefly or one of those rental services anyway.
2246480	2247480	Rent the game, get the points, send it back.
2247480	2248480	Exactly.
2248480	2252940	I think it's just a coincidence, and I think that's just a trend that a lot of games are
2252940	2257940	coming out and have more achievements, but I don't know.
2257940	2261760	It's cool that achievements are in there, but I don't think it really has anything to
2261760	2264640	do with the way games sell.
2264640	2267840	I don't hear reviews talking about achievements.
2267840	2275640	All right, well, this game will not have any achievements, sadly, because it's not on an
2275640	2276640	Xbox platform.
2276640	2280800	It's SingStar, which is Sony's answer, of course, to Karaoke Revolution.
2280800	2283760	There's a new version of SingStar that might surprise you.
2283760	2285560	It's only coming out in Europe.
2285560	2292040	It's not coming out over here, but it's SingStar Bollywood is coming out on Friday in Europe.
2292040	2295560	Actually, I'm sorry, that was last Friday, so it's already out in Europe.
2295560	2299720	Now, you don't have to learn a whole new language, even though the Bollywood songs, of course,
2299720	2301240	I'm referring to when I say Bollywood.
2301240	2305400	I'm talking about cinema from India, which they like to burst.
2305400	2308440	Even in the action movies, they'll burst out into song.
2308440	2312960	And I'm talking like, you want to talk about Sony and freaking show tunes?
2312960	2316200	This is the game with it, because you get show tunes in all those Indian movies, and
2316200	2319600	they're really over the top, real fun stuff and catchy stuff.
2319600	2321600	We were watching the Bollywood Awards last night.
2321600	2325160	Yeah, I was just going to say, yeah, we went to Indian food today, actually, for lunch.
2325160	2329960	We had a little Jamie Robb brunch at the Indian food place, and they were watching some award,
2329960	2330960	and they were doing some of the musicals.
2330960	2331960	I got that guy's name.
2331960	2332960	And some of it's catchy.
2332960	2334240	I got that guy's name.
2334240	2335240	What is it?
2335240	2336240	I'm glad that you got to see that performance.
2336240	2337240	Akshay Kumar?
2337240	2339680	Sadly, he is not in this game.
2339680	2342400	That's sad, because that was a freaking good performance.
2342400	2343400	All right.
2343400	2344400	But that would be cool.
2344400	2347480	See, I would get that if we would get a release over here.
2347480	2349400	Well, who knows?
2349400	2351720	Write some emails, make some demands.
2351720	2353240	You never know what might happen.
2353240	2357680	Anyhow, the full song list is floating around out there, but I do notice certain artists
2357680	2360520	are repeated several times in the game.
2360520	2361520	So check that out.
2361520	2362520	Like Calho Naho is...
2362520	2365080	I think those are the actual movies and not the artists.
2365080	2366760	Oh, that one makes sense.
2366760	2367760	I got you.
2367760	2369640	Oh, so these are the productions, okay.
2369640	2372920	So there's quite a few there from Calho Naho, that movie.
2372920	2376560	A song called Pretty Woman, but I don't think it's the same one most people over on this
2376560	2381800	side of the ocean would think of when they think of that song, Pretty Woman.
2381800	2384720	Mark Tetsuya in chat room says, we need to import this game for Loki.
2384720	2386080	I don't know, Loki.
2386080	2387080	Feel like singing some Bollywood?
2387080	2389080	I don't feel like singing anything.
2389080	2396240	Yeah, I'm actually posting that website to the chat room, because my impromptu website
2396240	2397240	of the week.
2397240	2398240	All right.
2398240	2399240	It lives.
2399240	2409400	So, at any rate, in other news, there is still going to be a Golden Axe update.
2409400	2415960	It will be Golden Axe Beast Rider, which is exclusive for Xbox 360.
2415960	2424360	And they are talking about them going to be a PS3 version, but it may not be the same
2424360	2425360	one.
2425360	2427200	But it's supposed to be a Golden Axe RPG.
2427200	2431920	I heard that both of those games are coming out in the spring of next year, I think February
2431920	2432920	or March.
2432920	2436440	Well, that makes happy, because I like Golden Axe.
2436440	2442720	But I didn't see the Beast Rider thing on there or anything like that, but who knows.
2442720	2446000	That's kind of cool, at least.
2446000	2448560	Anywho, so let's see here.
2448560	2452960	There's some other interesting stuff that was floating around the web this week, including
2452960	2460080	a mod for the PC version of Half-Life 2, which includes the portal gun from, of course, Portal.
2460080	2461480	And looks pretty awesome.
2461480	2465440	Of course, you know, all the fun things you would imagine you could do with a portal gun,
2465440	2468360	including throwing grenades through it and whatnot.
2468360	2476240	But who knows, maybe we'll see some multiplayer mods for Portal as well.
2476240	2477880	Or maybe an official release.
2477880	2478880	Yeah.
2478880	2480440	Lots of love in our chat room, by the way.
2480440	2483980	I noticed before the show started tonight, we had a lot of people in chat just spilling
2483980	2486920	out their love for Portal, which is a game I have yet to play.
2486920	2491520	You need to bring it over, Loki, because I don't want to spend all that money for the
2491520	2494000	Orange Box, because I've been buying too many games lately.
2494000	2499080	Nothing against the folks at the Orange Box, but we need to share our resources here at
2499080	2500080	Orange Lounge Radio.
2500080	2501080	But I do want to play Portal.
2501080	2502800	I've heard a lot of good things about it.
2502800	2506680	And footy monsters repeating over and over in chat, the cake is a lie, which I know is
2506680	2507960	a reference to something in the game.
2507960	2508960	I've heard about the cake.
2508960	2510400	I've seen the ending.
2510400	2512240	It does look kind of cool.
2512240	2516920	Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line, if
2516920	2523040	you want to give us a call at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username, Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
2523040	2526600	And I'm expecting we're going to get quite a few calls tonight, because sadly, last week,
2526600	2531400	due to the outage of our internet on the broadcast computer, we weren't able to take Skype calls.
2531400	2534560	So I expect double the calls this week.
2534560	2538960	And boy, this is one hell of a final story tonight.
2538960	2542600	You know, they've got Pokémon everything out there this day and age, right?
2542600	2546140	They've got, you know, the Pokémon, well obviously, look at my collection of stuffed
2546140	2547140	animals up here.
2547140	2550960	You've got the Pokémon, the Pikachus I have, little stuffed Jigglypuffs, you can get them
2550960	2555840	on mugs, shirts, hell, probably underoos with Pokémon on them too.
2555840	2560840	But now you can get Pokémon Perfume.
2560840	2565680	That's right, you can smell like Pikachu, I guess?
2565680	2567280	Peek-a-poo!
2567280	2571600	It's made by AirVal International, is the name of the group that puts this out.
2571600	2574280	It'll cost you $15 US.
2574280	2577520	Please do not buy this for your children, because there's enough stinky perfume in the
2577520	2578520	world, thank you.
2578520	2579520	Who knows?
2579520	2582520	Actually, I wish sometimes the internet had a scratch and sniff thing on it, because I'm
2582520	2586200	kind of curious, what does Pikachu perfume smell like?
2586200	2589240	It's probably just some kind of like generic scent, I don't know.
2589240	2592880	I think that almost all perfume smells nasty though, but I'm allergic to it.
2592880	2596000	Now Footy Monster would like to point out, when I was a kid, you could get Transformers
2596000	2600240	perfume Skye, it's not that rare to see perfumes of the popular franchises.
2600240	2603840	Yeah, but still, come on.
2603840	2604840	Come on.
2604840	2606600	Pikachu perfume?
2606600	2608600	I don't know.
2608600	2609600	Whatever.
2609600	2612120	Son of Dad thinks they should make Pokemon lube.
2612120	2613120	Ew.
2613120	2614120	Ew.
2614120	2615120	No.
2615120	2616120	Do not want.
2616120	2617120	Do not want.
2617120	2618120	Skype line is open for business.
2618120	2622960	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
2622960	2626520	Go ahead and give us a call, and everything you want to talk about that we've talked about
2626520	2629880	on this week's show, or maybe there's a story that you want to talk about that we didn't
2629880	2635600	get to tonight, because actually in our choosing stories threads behind the scenes, there's
2635600	2637720	quite a lot of stories that didn't make the cut tonight.
2637720	2641400	I'm sure Loki will be getting to some of them, though, in last minute stories.
2641400	2645120	So Loki, while we wait for some calls, why don't we go over some last minute stories?
2645120	2646240	Okay.
2646240	2650280	There is one interesting thing, real briefly.
2650280	2654320	There is a Mass Effect Limited Edition coming out.
2654320	2659800	It's only going to be available online only through EBN GameStop, which is kind of weird.
2659800	2665680	But I don't know, it comes out the same day, so November 20th.
2665680	2667520	Let's see here.
2667520	2673080	Then there was some other stuff, I guess, coming from Nintendo Power.
2673080	2677160	Chris Slate, he was saying that there's going to be a brand new online community coming
2677160	2684840	soon from Nintendo Power, because remember, they closed the insider forums at one time.
2684840	2690840	Also, another interesting thing from the Simpsons game, which is of course being put out by
2690840	2691840	EA.
2691840	2693160	Grant that Scratchy's no more.
2693160	2695720	They've been made to change the name to Mob Rules now.
2695720	2698080	So apparently those lawsuit things were working.
2698080	2699080	Wow.
2699080	2700080	Alright, well we're...
2700080	2701080	I just lost the call.
2701080	2703240	We had a call coming in on Skype and I missed it.
2703240	2704240	Damn it.
2704240	2705240	No.
2705240	2706240	I have a story.
2706240	2707240	Alright, sure, Jamie.
2707240	2708240	Real quick.
2708240	2713560	Flint Dill, I guess that's how his last name is pronounced, was one of the writers for
2713560	2717760	Riddick and he's working on the Sin City game and he and Frank Miller are working together
2717760	2718760	on it.
2718760	2721240	And the quote says, Frank and I have been having a party coming up with nasty stuff
2721240	2722240	for the game.
2722240	2727120	In true Sin City fashion, some old characters will return, new characters will appear and
2727120	2729800	without giving anything away, probably die horribly.
2729800	2733280	Well, I don't know if the game is going to be anything like the movie.
2733280	2735560	I'm sure I will feel it is all style and no substance.
2735560	2738960	I saw a little bit of the movie and I thought it was horrible.
2738960	2741600	Not my favorite movie in the world, but it's certainly pretty to look at.
2741600	2743900	Hey, we're finally getting some calls on Skype line.
2743900	2744900	Welcome to Orange Launch Radio.
2744900	2745900	Who's this?
2745900	2746900	Hey guys, what's up?
2746900	2747900	This is Footy Monster.
2747900	2748900	Hi, Footy Monster.
2748900	2749900	How you doing?
2749900	2750900	Not too bad, not too bad.
2750900	2753240	What about you guys?
2753240	2755960	I noticed that last week you had quite a hectic show.
2755960	2758040	Can you sort it all out?
2758040	2760400	Yeah, last week's show was very interesting.
2760400	2764720	We had surprise guests, surprise outages.
2764720	2765720	Chris was here.
2765720	2768400	Of course, we love Chris and Puppy was here, which was awesome.
2768400	2774040	And then we had, the show didn't get started for 40 minutes or no, it was 20 minutes it
2774040	2780640	took us to get the show started because in our studio, we used to have four mics and
2780640	2784680	one of the mics started failing, which is our guest mics.
2784680	2788920	And it was a microphone that I believe Eddie or Casper the Gay was using on episode 250
2788920	2791560	and it was really cutting out bad, so we had to ditch that mic.
2791560	2797200	And then for whatever reason, the mic cable was not working on Loki's mic, like the cable
2797200	2798520	just stopped working.
2798520	2800720	It's not the microphone because we tested it with the other cable.
2800720	2805160	So we thought, okay, take the old cable from the mic that broke and put it on the microphone
2805160	2808040	that still works, but that didn't work, it caused a horrendous buzz.
2808040	2809800	And so, oh my gosh, it was just horrible.
2809800	2813480	But we fixed it, we went and we got a new cable and a new microphone and everything's
2813480	2817760	hunky-dory again and we're up to four microphones, which is going to be great for our guests.
2817760	2818760	So very happy.
2818760	2823720	And then of course our internet went out during part B, so we had no live element last week,
2823720	2824720	which kind of sucked.
2824720	2828880	But then we did the Operator 11 stuff, the bonus show we did for the live host.
2828880	2829880	Which was really cool, by the way.
2829880	2833640	Yeah, we actually had a lot of fun doing it and we're kind of doing it again tonight.
2833640	2837080	Even for the podcast listeners, if you go to operator11.com a little later, you're actually
2837080	2838760	going to see our Guitar Hero 3 preview.
2838760	2842240	We're going to unbox the demo kit and show you guys the guitar and the changeable face
2842240	2845820	plate and to show you guys all the in-z's and out-z's of Guitar Hero 3 a little later
2845820	2846820	on this evening.
2846820	2849720	So for those of you listening on the podcast, check that out at operator11.com.
2849720	2852440	I'll definitely be there checking it out.
2852440	2853440	Thank you.
2853440	2854440	Is that all you wanted to ask?
2854440	2855440	Nope.
2855440	2859520	No, she had a little comment from the dark side because it's like, go ahead Mike, grab
2859520	2862880	a little pause on Music Jam, Hamilton Music Jam.
2862880	2864880	What's up?
2864880	2869320	I actually played it and it's good.
2869320	2870320	That's right.
2870320	2874000	I remember you getting all excited about the Hannah Montana game and now you actually have
2874000	2875640	it in your possession.
2875640	2878880	So tell us a little bit again about the Hannah Montana game.
2878880	2881280	Okay, so good news for low-key.
2881280	2886860	It is not that pink and fluffy, but seriously, the only time you see the face of the girl
2886860	2891760	and all the pinkness is in the beginning, like you see the splash screen.
2891760	2896000	But other than that, the game is pretty normal, low-key with the girliness.
2896000	2898040	So I guess that's a good thing.
2898040	2901280	But what's interesting is that the way it's set up, like when you start the game, you
2901280	2905320	don't have the freedom to choose, for instance, to play just the drums or to play just the
2905320	2906320	bass guitar.
2906320	2908200	You're supposed to make the song.
2908200	2913300	So because of that, you first have to play the lead guitar and make the rhythm, which
2913300	2914300	you can record.
2914300	2918240	You have metronome so you can do everything and it's really like jam sessions.
2918240	2922880	Like you press the D-pad and you select the chords, you have a whole selection of chords,
2922880	2925680	but you can't customize the chords like you can in jam sessions.
2925680	2929760	So that's a plus for jam sessions, but not for Hannah Montana.
2929760	2934880	But then once you're done recording your lead guitar, which it's not just strumming, you
2934880	2940080	can also pick individual strings, which is really good, then you can record a bass with
2940080	2941400	individual strings for strumming.
2941400	2950320	You can record a guitar for little solos and stuff, and you can even do the whammy bar
2950320	2951320	and all that stuff.
2951320	2952320	So it's really interesting.
2952320	2953960	It's really feature complete.
2953960	2954960	Is there any…
2954960	2960080	The drum kit can play with two styluses if you want, so you have sort of like two little
2960080	2963000	drumsticks or you can use the whole DSO buttons.
2963000	2971120	Every button is signed for the drum stuff, so you can press like B and it does the big
2971120	2976480	drum thingy, and if you press like the D-pad, it does the hi-hat and stuff like that.
2976480	2983560	Is there like a plot or a stage set up or is it just like jam sessions where you just
2983560	2984720	kind of rock out?
2984720	2989800	Yeah, but you know what's funny, that you can then take your song and there's an option
2989800	2993240	to make a music video, which it features Hannah Montana.
2993240	2998640	You can change the camera around and make her play or make her dance around.
2998640	3003480	I mean seriously, it's a feature that's not there, which you might not like, but it's
3003480	3006960	so much more feature complete, I'm surprised.
3006960	3011480	Well, you've definitely become the unofficial spokesperson for the Hannah Montana franchise
3011480	3016040	here on the show, so I'm curious to hear if some of our listeners actually go out and
3016040	3018280	pick up this game and what they also think of it.
3018280	3023040	So I'm glad to hear that it was only 20 bucks, so not too bad a bargain.
3023040	3025720	Well, hey, we've got to let you go to let some other folks on, but thank you so much
3025720	3027880	for your call and have fun with the Hannah Montana.
3027880	3028880	All right.
3028880	3029880	All right.
3029880	3030880	Cool guys.
3030880	3031880	Take care.
3031880	3032880	Take care.
3032880	3038880	If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orangeloungeradio.
3038880	3043840	Meanwhile, any more last minute stories over yonder, over hither?
3043840	3046520	Yeah, some interesting things.
3046520	3052480	There is a new Logitech PC controller that apparently worked perfectly on the PlayStation
3052480	3055320	3.
3055320	3056320	I don't know.
3056320	3057320	It was kind of interesting.
3057320	3062120	It's a cool action game pad is what it is, but it works on the PlayStation 3, which is
3062120	3067200	kind of surprising that a PC controller would work on it.
3067200	3070160	And then another thing, which is kind of funny, and just mention it.
3070160	3073280	Apparently Gran Turismo 5 is not really 1080p.
3073280	3074280	Let's go to another call.
3074280	3075280	Hi, you're on Orangeloungeradio.
3075280	3076280	Who's this?
3076280	3077280	Hey, what's up?
3077280	3078280	This is Rheoma.
3078280	3079280	Hey, Rheoma.
3079280	3080280	What's on your mind, buddy?
3080280	3081280	Nothing much.
3081280	3087000	It was actually something that I was kind of interested in asking you guys.
3087000	3090800	I've been kind of on a Super Metroid tear recently.
3090800	3094120	It's probably one of my favorite Super Nintendo games.
3094120	3098280	But obviously one of the fascinations of the games is the speed run element.
3098280	3102040	So I just want to know, what do you guys think of the speed run element?
3102040	3105200	I don't think I've ever heard you mention anything about it.
3105200	3108200	So what are your opinions on Super Nintendo games?
3108200	3109200	I'm sorry.
3109200	3110200	Run that by me one more time.
3110200	3114080	You said Super Metroid and what, because you're a little bit fuzzy.
3114080	3116120	So say that again.
3116120	3118320	You want to know our opinion on?
3118320	3119320	Speed running.
3119320	3121600	Oh, speed running.
3121600	3122600	Speed running through the games.
3122600	3123600	Oh, yes.
3123600	3124840	Speed runs are great.
3124840	3126120	They're fun to watch on YouTube.
3126120	3127560	I'm not very good at it.
3127560	3128880	Actually, that's not true.
3128880	3136880	I have, just for shits and giggles, played through Mario Brothers as fast as I can, just
3136880	3141080	to kind of like, I don't want to say impress friends, because that's not really what I'm
3141080	3144120	doing, but just to kind of have fun.
3144120	3149300	Sometimes some of my friends who don't really get into video games all that much do remember
3149300	3153240	the old NES classics like Super Mario Brothers and kind of have fun watching somebody just
3153240	3154960	jam through the game.
3154960	3155960	Dark Sakura?
3155960	3162780	Well, remember I told you that I did the 8-1 level of Super Mario Brothers blindfolded?
3162780	3164120	That was during a speed run.
3164120	3165120	Wow.
3165120	3166120	That's awesome.
3166120	3168880	Well, it's because the whole level, if you don't, I mean, you can stop and try to get
3168880	3173640	all the points, but if you're trying to have a full time, close to a full time, or by the
3173640	3176880	time you get to the end of the thing and not get hit by anything, it's a definite pattern
3176880	3178500	to the whole level.
3178500	3181300	So that was, it was during a speed run that I did it blindfolded.
3181300	3186360	I probably couldn't do it since I haven't touched the game in five years, but, you know.
3186360	3190200	And certainly a game like Super Metroid encourages you to do speed runs because you know you
3190200	3194000	want the bra and panties shot at the end, so in order to get that, you have to go through
3194000	3196680	the game kind of as fast as you can.
3196680	3201600	And some folks, folks in chat room getting in on the conversation as well, Tiger Claw
3201600	3205960	says the thing about Metroid speed runs is they do a lot of sequence breaking, basically
3205960	3208560	collecting all the items and power-ups out of order.
3208560	3212220	And the thing about the original Metroid as well, I know you don't have to have this item
3212220	3217100	to beat the game, but it helps, but the screw attack, you can get that pretty early on,
3217100	3220240	and that makes the game so much easier, especially the old school Metroid.
3220240	3226960	Frisbee is plugging a site, speeddemosarchive.org.
3226960	3228960	And there's also speeddemosarchive.com.
3228960	3229960	Maybe you made a mistake.
3229960	3230960	I'm not sure.
3230960	3235160	Are there any particular speed demos that you're a fan of, Ryoma?
3235160	3237320	No, not really.
3237320	3243320	I personally think that speedrunning kind of takes the enjoyment out of the game.
3243320	3248240	I mean, I understand that somebody loves a game to the point where they can just play
3248240	3250240	through it really insanely quickly.
3250240	3255120	I can do that with Mega Man X. I can beat Mega Man X when I was really good at it in
3255120	3258160	about half an hour.
3258160	3261520	I mean, to me, it just kind of sucks the enjoyment out of the game.
3261520	3262520	I don't know.
3262520	3268280	Well, for me, it's just like one extra challenge in a game that may not necessarily be there
3268280	3269280	originally.
3269280	3274640	Like, if you look at a list of, it's kind of like achievements on the Xbox 360.
3274640	3278680	If you look at a list of 20 different things you can do on a game, speedrunning the game
3278680	3284480	is one thing that you can do for fun, but I wouldn't obsess over speedruns or think
3284480	3288320	somebody sucks because they can't get through a game fast because there's different ways
3288320	3289320	to play the game.
3289320	3295200	There's also the complete anal retentive gameplay, which is me on any role-playing game.
3295200	3296800	I search everything.
3296800	3302520	I talk to everybody, but I finish most of those games with some type of 100% completion
3302520	3307560	or something like that because I'm so freaking anal retentive in my RPGs because I feel like
3307560	3311320	I'm missing out on the story or I'm missing something important if I don't do it.
3311320	3313740	So that's like the complete opposite of a speedrun.
3313740	3316880	But I think that's one way you can certainly enjoy a game as well, right?
3316880	3317880	Yeah.
3317880	3320920	I mean, I understand that.
3320920	3323600	I've never been one of those guys personally.
3323600	3324880	You're probably somewhere in the middle.
3324880	3325880	Most people are.
3325880	3326880	Yeah.
3326880	3327880	Well, very cool.
3327880	3328920	Well, you know what?
3328920	3329920	You're right.
3329920	3332720	We haven't talked about speedrunning a lot on the show, but there you go.
3332720	3333940	That's why we invite the calls.
3333940	3337080	They get us to talk about things we may not normally talk about.
3337080	3339400	So anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3339400	3340400	Yeah.
3340400	3341400	One more thing.
3341400	3343840	Yeah, don't buy Boogie.
3343840	3344840	Don't buy Boogie.
3344840	3346520	Why should I stay the hell away from Boogie?
3346520	3349000	Because it's a terrible game.
3349000	3350240	What about it is so terrible?
3350240	3351240	Wait.
3351240	3352240	Say that again.
3352240	3354740	What about it is so terrible?
3354740	3356440	The karaoke is terrible.
3356440	3359840	It's a very simple game.
3359840	3362520	I found absolutely no enjoyment in it.
3362520	3367800	So I mean, maybe there's some rhythm game, like super hardcore rhythm aficionado out
3367800	3369500	there that'll love Boogie.
3369500	3370640	I didn't.
3370640	3373720	Or maybe a 12-year-old girl somewhere.
3373720	3378360	Rababa in our chat room agrees with you, says Boogie is a doorstop.
3378360	3380960	You can't adjust timing.
3380960	3381960	It's a doorstop.
3381960	3382960	Nice.
3382960	3383960	All right.
3383960	3388360	Well, Ryoma, thanks so much for the call, and stay the hell away from Boogie, everybody.
3388360	3389360	Amen.
3389360	3390360	All right.
3390360	3391360	Have a good one, buddy.
3391360	3392360	You too.
3392360	3393360	All right.
3393360	3396180	So a very cold review for Boogie.
3396180	3398680	By the way, just be prepared.
3398680	3402720	If you're going to call in and tell us that a game sucks, we are going to ask you why.
3402720	3404160	We try to kind of get into it.
3404160	3406600	And I do this to Loki, too, when he says, don't play this.
3406600	3407600	It sucks.
3407600	3408600	Well, why?
3408600	3411800	You know, because there's reasons why you love games, but there's also reasons why you
3411800	3412800	hate them.
3412800	3414440	Well, we want to know why a game sucks.
3414440	3417320	So if you want to give us a call, we'll take at least one more call.
3417320	3422080	Use the name OrangeOnsRadio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR, and look, we're getting a call right now.
3422080	3423080	So let's take it.
3423080	3424080	Hi.
3424080	3425080	You're on OrangeOnsRadio.
3425080	3426080	Who's this?
3426080	3427080	It's GS68.
3427080	3428080	Hi, GS68.
3428080	3432280	When are you guys bringing back guys on the show?
3432280	3434680	Our spin-off show is on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3434680	3435800	That's a very good question.
3435800	3437400	When are we bringing back?
3437400	3440200	You know, our spin-off shows have been having a lot of trauma lately.
3440200	3444720	Unfortunately, Jamie's computer went poof, so that kind of screwed our Tuesday show.
3444720	3447460	Xtifer moved, which kind of screwed our Wednesday show.
3447460	3449960	Our Thursday show is still going, SDFU.
3449960	3450960	Actually, no.
3450960	3458760	Like, sometimes I drop by to listen to SDFU, but, like, nothing happens.
3458760	3465040	Well, I'll have to get on our buddy up in Washington, Insanist, and see what's going
3465040	3466040	on with that.
3466040	3470800	I would say probably our weeknight shows are going to be in a bit of limbo.
3470800	3474720	We're just kind of focusing everything on the Sunday shows right now, but I'm hoping
3474720	3478760	around the time when we can kind of re-energize our website, because our website's falling
3478760	3483880	apart too, kind of around the same time we were able to give that a kick in the ass,
3483880	3488720	which I'm hoping will be by year's end, we can kind of go back to the whole spin-off
3488720	3493720	shows and really being more of a station than just one solitary show.
3493720	3496080	So I'm sorry to hear you miss them, but I hope they will come back soon.
3496080	3499440	I know Xtifer's interested in doing the show again, so I'll get with them and see what
3499440	3500440	we can do.
3500440	3504240	I know Rice Princess was very gung-ho about her Less Than Three idea, and I've had some
3504240	3508360	other proposals for shows I'm excited about too, and I know Jamie wants to get started
3508360	3510520	again as soon as she gets her computer up and running.
3510520	3511520	Yes?
3511520	3512520	If I ever do.
3512520	3513520	I hope you do.
3513520	3517120	And you also were tossing around, I don't know if I can even say, but there was another
3517120	3520120	show idea you were tossing around.
3520120	3521120	Working on it.
3521120	3522120	Working on it.
3522120	3527320	So I'm hoping 2008, in the early stages of that, we can really refocus, but for right
3527320	3533160	now we're making sure our Sunday show is staying consistent and doing this, so that's all we
3533160	3534160	got.
3534160	3541960	Besides, I have a class from 53645, and it takes me around 15 to 30 minutes to get back
3541960	3549680	to my house from my campus, so it'll be hard to catch guys on the show if I wanted to.
3549680	3556840	Well, I can tell you that the shows that don't use licensed music as a part of it, we may
3556840	3558680	be looking into doing more podcasting.
3558680	3561240	You know, STFU is being podcasted for a little bit there.
3561240	3564920	We're thinking about it, so it's very possible.
3564920	3565920	You may see that.
3565920	3566920	So you can listen whenever you want?
3566920	3567920	All right.
3567920	3569920	Because hell, everybody podcasts these days.
3569920	3573400	Well, I don't listen to podcasts anymore.
3573400	3575000	I like the live experience better.
3575000	3579500	I agree the live experience is ten times better, which is why we do this, and I think is part
3579500	3583960	of what sets us apart from a lot of other folks that do this.
3583960	3590200	You know, the live element is great, and I can't imagine doing a tape show, at least
3590200	3591400	not right now.
3591400	3592400	I don't know.
3592400	3593400	Who knows?
3593400	3594400	It's a whole other challenge.
3594400	3595400	All right.
3595400	3599100	Well, GS68, thanks so much for the call, and thanks for being such a fan of the station
3599100	3603000	and calling us on our crap when we're missing out on the stuff we should be doing.
3603000	3604000	No problem.
3604000	3605000	All right.
3605000	3606000	Take care, buddy.
3606000	3607000	See you.
3607000	3608000	Bye-bye.
3608000	3611840	Ah, our website does need some help badly.
3611840	3617080	I seem to remember like a long time ago we got some offer from a website design company
3617080	3618080	in our mailbag.
3618080	3619080	We should have taken it.
3619080	3620840	That's why we didn't.
3620840	3624120	If you design websites and think you have some good ideas for us, we're looking for
3624120	3629840	something we can update very easily, like how WordPress will just let you go right in
3629840	3630840	there and type a new story.
3630840	3634040	We need something easy so we can stay on top of it.
3634040	3635640	We'll see.
3635640	3636640	We're exploring ideas.
3636640	3640380	I have a lot of time off this Christmas, and I'm going to be definitely focusing on Orange
3640380	3646160	Lounge Radio during that time and definitely stalking Dark Soccer and Loki for all their
3646160	3648120	help.
3648120	3652200	So I don't see the phone ringing anymore, but let's see if there's any more last minute
3652200	3654080	stories and we'll see if we get any other calls.
3654080	3658200	Okay, other fun stuff about that beautiful Katamari download content that we talked about
3658200	3659200	earlier.
3659200	3660280	They're just keys.
3660280	3664740	All that info was already in the game, so you're just unlocking the ability to play
3664740	3665740	it.
3665740	3666740	Hooray!
3666740	3670200	You've got to love it when game companies do that.
3670200	3677240	Let's see what else.
3677240	3682180	There should be some type of ban on being able to call that downloadable content.
3682180	3685440	That's not downloadable content when it's already on the disk.
3685440	3687920	That is unlocked content.
3687920	3689760	That is pay to unlock content.
3689760	3693960	I think we should start a movement that we are not going to refer to that stuff as downloadable
3693960	3695560	content anymore.
3695560	3696560	Let's call it what it is.
3696560	3698600	It's pay to unlock content.
3698600	3702040	Anyway, I just wanted to start a revolution.
3702040	3703040	Never mind me.
3703040	3707800	Well, you know, if we wanted to start a revolution, we could also get rid of the micro-transaction
3707800	3708800	term.
3708800	3709800	God, this is stupid.
3709800	3712640	No, there's that too.
3712640	3715320	There's this one website.
3715320	3718080	It's One Player Start or One Piece Start.
3718080	3722800	Apparently, they have a comprehensive list of people who are ruining Halo 3 and it runs
3722800	3725600	down in the wonderful categories swordsmen.
3725600	3731440	That's the first people, of course, that play Halo 3 that use nothing but swords.
3731440	3741920	Rocket whores, laser lovers, children, campers, hip-slinging snipers, achievement whores,
3741920	3750520	deserters, heavy brothers, and I guess that's it.
3750520	3752720	Heavy breathers, my mistake.
3752720	3753720	That makes more sense.
3753720	3757240	I guess that's going to go ahead and do it for us tonight and wrap up because we do want
3757240	3760880	to get out of here at a somewhat reasonable hour because we're going to be doing the Guitar
3760880	3762320	Hero 3 thing in a little bit.
3762320	3765880	So we're going to wrap it up and say goodnight, but in order to do that, we have to go around
3765880	3768640	and get everybody's final thought.
3768640	3769640	We'll start with Loki tonight.
3769640	3772020	Loki, your final thought.
3772020	3778700	My final thought is, there's a lot of games coming out soon, I need more money.
3778700	3783280	My final thought is root beer is delicious, but root beer floats are even better.
3783280	3786960	Ooh, but Dole Whip floats are the best.
3786960	3789880	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
3789880	3791680	I don't have one.
3791680	3794280	Abstaining tonight from the final thought process.
3794280	3795280	That's okay.
3795280	3796280	No.
3796280	3797280	It's a free country.
3797280	3798280	I just don't have one.
3798280	3799280	All right.
3799280	3800280	Fair enough.
3800280	3804780	Well, thank you guys very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting
