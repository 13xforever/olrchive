5892	14759	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15459	19142	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19623	23786	And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, October the 21st, 2007.
25067	28370	And of course, Orange Lounge Radio does tape live on Sunday nights.
28963	36088	and releases the live show in two parts, Part A and B. And you're listening to Part B right now, which means we've already taken care of the formalities.
36528	38189	So let's get back to the gaming news.
39270	45114	So anyways, something we've been talking about for the last few weeks here is the Xbox 360 Arcade SKU.
45154	46895	It doesn't exist, but it actually does.
47656	54861	Apparently, there's been some interesting proof for this, including someone actually buying one.
55001	56882	So, I mean, duh.
57483	57663	But...
58604	63265	Yeah, it is basically a core system now with a wireless controller.
63565	65106	It does have HDMI on it.
65446	74908	It will feature a 256 megabyte memory unit and a disc including five Xbox Live Arcade trial games, apparently.
75308	82730	Boom Boom Rocket, Feeding Frenzy, Luxor 2, and Pac-Man Championship and Uno.
82870	84031	That's fucking lame.
84111	85471	They're only trial games?
86568	86768	and so on.
108563	109364	I don't know.
109384	111586	They didn't really say what it's on there.
112206	115249	Well, maybe if Microsoft will actually acknowledge the existence of this.
115289	116090	Let me tell you this much.
116110	121754	I'm not supposed to say anything, but it's going to be fucking announced on the 23rd officially because that's the day it comes out.
121774	122235	Well, that's fine.
122275	123756	This podcast won't hit until the 23rd.
124697	126478	It will be officially announced on the 23rd.
126899	131342	I don't know why, even after all this stuff, that they're still insisting on keeping it a fucking secret.
131603	134485	I mean, when people are leaking it out there, it's been purchased.
134625	135406	It's been out there.
136090	140853	Why they're still denying it's coming out, but they have a whole marketing plan behind it, how they're going to promote it and stuff.
141153	143575	So it will be officially announced on the 23rd.
143595	145616	What's so special about the 23rd?
146737	149239	It's whenever they're fucking... It's when this is coming out.
149279	151140	I don't know why.
151180	153121	Does it line up with an expo or something?
153381	155242	No, it's just whenever they feel like it.
155463	156083	Interesting.
157084	164128	And I guess, I think also at the same time, that's when the Elite console, or the bundle that they're doing for the holidays is coming out as well.
164248	164408	So...
166508	170976	That's pretty much it.
171898	173100	Not a huge surprise.
174282	177007	It was totally not coming out or anything.
179011	185753	Back to the rumor camp, and you know, most Microsoft rumors do end up being true, so this could be something that does come to light.
186113	186693	Although, I don't know.
186833	188333	This is a little bit far-fetched for me.
189114	190754	I forgot to mention, sorry, real quick.
191414	192974	It was confirmed by Microsoft.
192994	195975	They did confirm that it is, you know, coming.
196075	198136	They just never said anything else beyond that.
198256	200256	But they're like, you just need to wait for details.
200696	204877	They're like, Arcade for us is the ability to bring in a new set of audiences.
204897	207298	They're probably a little bit more casually focused.
208101	212726	and they're looking for a new family experience and they're more price focused.
212806	218912	Robbie Bach told Financial Times, marketing Microsoft's first public comments about the new SKU.
218932	222836	Of course, they didn't really say what was included with it or any of the details and stuff.
222896	231484	Like I said, 23rd, all this will be finally officially announced and our Microsoft rep can finally calm down a little bit.
232116	240118	Well, this will be something that could bring people in, and that is combining the HD DVD player and the Xbox 360.
240158	242738	A lot of us have kind of wondered, why hasn't this been done already?
243098	251300	Well, there are rumors going around that Toshiba is actually teaming up with Microsoft to be making an actual HD DVD slash Xbox 360.
251340	259262	And when I hear this, my mind kind of goes to, you remember the Panasonic Q, I think it was called, that was the GameCube slash DVD player that you could only get in Japan?
259582	260822	Duel HD Tuners with a Program Guide
286028	294777	An MP3 player dock and possibly also a 40-inch TV to come with it or sold separately that will dock the actual 360.
294897	296158	Here's a funny thought.
296518	303165	Because I remember way back when they were talking about TVs that would have the original Xbox integrated into them.
303966	304727	and something like this.
305207	306828	How much do you want to bet this isn't actually a 360?
307568	313271	It's a Toshiba HD DVD player that will also play Xbox 360 games.
313771	315452	That's kind of what the Panasonic Q was, right?
315492	317633	It was just a DVD player that would also play GameCube games.
318314	318934	It was kind of cool.
319795	324257	So anyway, here's why folks are getting all speculative about this.
324617	331241	Apparently an unnamed or unknown Toshiba rep actually said, an Xbox with a built-in DVD drive is critical.
331722	333122	They and we are working on it.
333483	336084	It also has to be more than a gaming machine.
336424	337885	Microsoft recognizes this.
338266	341968	A version of the device may also be sold under the Toshiba brand name.
345530	346371	That would make sense.
346391	348312	I mean, didn't we have a bajillion different versions of the CD-i?
349640	351503	I suppose.
351963	360854	It is kind of interesting because I don't think we've seen anything really like this since the Panasonic Q. And even then, the Panasonic Q wasn't even sold here.
361135	362957	And here's the thing too about that.
363197	365881	That way, if it is branded under the Toshiba name,
366388	367088	Thanks for watching!
390460	396164	Let's hope the HD DVD ends up winning out, because otherwise that's going to be a big pile of useless crap.
396244	402209	Well, at least there's quite a few movies already available, including Heroes Season 1, which I still need to buy on HD DVD.
402749	405191	I don't really care about HD DVD at all, though.
406271	407192	I have a Blu-ray player.
408173	408893	All right, lady.
410274	416779	So, in other HD DVD news, you're also going to be given five...
417443	420525	Free movies if you buy the Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on.
421005	436854	You can choose from Serenity, which is like the best movie ever, The Chronicles of Riddick, Hulk, Children of Men, The Fast and the Furious, Tokyo Drift, Troy, Full Metal Jacket, yeah, Corpse Bride, The Prestige, Swordfish, Black Rain, Dreamgirls, and World Trade Center.
437695	442898	The way you claim this is you fill out a form, send in a copy of your barcode,
443872	446553	and Microsoft will send you your stuff within 28 days.
472557	474298	I can understand how the iPhone folks feel.
474718	475158	That's true.
475238	478159	Serenity is actually a movie I still need to get on HD DVD.
478299	480079	I somehow don't have it yet.
480099	481680	That's at Christmas, by the way.
482460	499725	I was going to say, it's kind of funny that you mentioned Heroes earlier because I believe that Best Buy is doing a thing right now where you can get a HD DVD add-on for the 360 and get a free copy of the Heroes HD DVD set, including also those five extra DVDs that you can mail away for.
499925	501726	Well, I just missed out on everything, didn't I?
502146	502286	Yeah.
502725	505646	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
530201	533762	The Weaver Girl, Shopping Spree, and High Calorie Katamari.
534782	543563	And basically what these are, the Milky Way Constellation has you roll up 88 constellations to create a new Milky Way.
544304	550085	The Weaver Girl, you roll up a huge ball of yarn and string to create Vega, the Weaver Girl.
550725	554585	And Shopping Spree, make a space station but be thrifty about it.
555245	558046	And I guess it sounds like an offshoot of a Katamari mission from
558826	563470	One of the previous games where the value of items are collected and taken into account.
563910	568433	And High Calorie Katamari, Feed Cetus the Whale, Roll Up Lots of Food.
568753	573637	And that reminds me a little bit of the one from We Love Katamari where you roll the sumo wrestler around.
573657	575018	Oh yeah, that was cool.
576459	579021	So those are available right now in Asia and Japan.
579141	580082	No word on the U.S.
580182	583284	yet, but I'm sure that they'll be coming soon.
583680	584720	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
606813	608834	Let it be known that OLR knows how to forgive.
609214	610474	I went out and bought the game anyway.
610974	615656	So when you look up forgiveness in the dictionary and see our picture next to it, you'll understand why.
616116	616616	Oh, don't worry.
616736	617497	I know how to forgive.
617637	618977	I went out and got the game as well.
619357	619557	Right.
619737	620478	I'm sure you did.
621198	621498	All right.
623129	623889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
644818	645939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
668171	669714	Great track record with that game.
669915	670737	We'll see.
670837	675087	Just in time for the premiere of Razor, Battlestar Galactica Razor.
675107	676550	Of course, the little miniseries about...
677569	680330	The Pegasus will be debuting November 24th.
681670	691053	By the way, for those folks that are asking how much the game will cost, such as JAP28 is asking in our chat room, $20 on the PC, $800 Microsoft Points, or $10 on Xbox Live Arcade.
691093	693153	You can get it a day earlier on PCs, October 23rd.
693173	693153	$20.
693193	694154	Not too shabby.
704523	707544	This is a little bit of joy, even though I'm probably not going to bother buying the game.
709544	715245	Sega Superstar Tennis is going to have, of course, a bunch of different Sega characters in it.
716005	717026	You have Sonic.
717186	720186	You have Amigo from Samba de Amigo, which I think is pretty cool.
720766	721386	Ooh la la.
722827	725347	It's being worked on by Sumo Digital.
726508	728768	I'm not seeing anything else about who else is going to be in it.
729941	734983	or a date for that matter, but we do have it on PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Nintendo DS.
735744	739885	Please tell me that every time Ulala hits the ball, she'll go, Chew!
740485	740886	Chew!
741406	741826	Chew!
743026	743547	That would be good.
743827	745547	For those that play Space Channel 5, that's fine.
745608	749709	I do like what they mentioned on Kotaku, that they want to see characters from House of the Dead and Altered Beast.
749829	750389	That'd be cool.
750409	751170	That would be kind of rad.
751210	752210	I want to play as a zombie.
753491	754271	That'd just be awesome.
755143	757004	And then, like, when you win, you eat the other person?
757244	759104	Amazing Zombie Tennis, the game.
759144	760085	That would be kind of fun.
761565	761925	We'll see.
761965	762866	Are you listening, Sega?
763566	764066	Make it happen.
765107	766187	I don't think that's going to happen.
766387	767888	I don't think so either, but it's kind of a dream.
768288	782333	Anyways, one thing that is happening, though, and also on the 23rd, will be Guitar Hero music, available for download, at least a digital download, and including music from Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 2, and Guitar Hero Encore Rock the 80s.
783508	789051	We'll be available from Wave Group and I guess affiliating with other stuff.
790032	796355	And it'll be available, I guess, across such download sites as AOL, iTunes, Napster, Rhapsody, and Yahoo.
797736	800857	Somebody told me there's actually a DDR soundtrack on iTunes now for Supernova 2.
800937	801698	I didn't even know that.
802318	802858	It's kind of neat.
803379	804379	I didn't know either, so.
804439	811243	We used to have our own little playlist uploaded on iTunes that had all the DDR music from the games and where they could be found on iTunes, but
811636	812557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
836192	839815	and hopefully the music won't stop like E4ALL did.
840235	843497	Somebody forgot to pay the bill at E4ALL and the power got shut off.
844078	844658	No, just kidding.
844678	845679	That's not the reason why.
845799	853884	But on Friday night at about 7 o'clock, E4ALL came to a very abrupt end because the lights went out.
854865	858588	A lot of folks were watching a match between Fatality.
859228	864792	He was playing Quake 4 and some other folks were playing Super Mario Galaxy and some of the other games that were available there.
865291	880255	and then the power shut off on the whole right half of South Hall and that would have been where the Nintendo and the EA booths were which were pretty much the main reasons why people were going to the show right there between those two and so they decided to end the show at that point.
880975	886216	The staff quickly escorted everybody out of the convention hall because when the power goes out that's actually not safe.
887076	888096	It's a safety hazard.
888436	888917	Money back!
888957	889177	Refund!
891062	894145	I know, but wasn't the show going to close at like 8 anyway?
894225	899191	I don't know, I don't remember the hours for the show, but I seem to recall it was going to close kind of early anyway.
899931	903155	And by the way, this isn't the first time something like this has happened at the convention center.
903635	906678	There have been some previous E3s where similar things have happened.
907159	914246	But it just kind of sucks that it's happening for E2E4ALL when they've been taking a lot of crap.
914724	921687	from various game blogs and stuff for not being up to the same level that many of us remember with the big E3 expos.
922147	926149	So this doesn't help them try to get past that.
926229	926689	You know what I mean?
928370	929490	Sorry, E4ALL.
930871	931611	No, you're not.
932632	933512	You're just saying that.
933852	934413	Alright, I am.
937510	941471	The PS3 is actually seeing an increase in sales in Europe now.
942371	944012	They have gone up by 178%.
944952	949833	Wow.
952774	958056	But that's with the introduction of the 60GB bundle and the new 40GB unit that came out.
959036	960777	Was there a price drop that just went in there?
960857	963057	Oh, yes, there was a price drop that happened too recently.
963458	964658	Yep, there was the price drop.
965123	980428	and I'm sure there may be... They also were saying that the software sales increased with Resistance Fall of Man actually taking a rise in its chart status and Heavenly Sword and Motorstorm.
981008	987891	Those are kind of the must-have PS3 games at this point, so not too surprising that folks getting their new PS3s are picking up those games.
988111	989831	That makes sense to me.
991712	992212	Anyways...
992868	997212	Oh my god, they totally announced the 4D egg system for the US.
997832	999373	I'm so shocked.
1000114	1002036	I did not realize that that was coming.
1002836	1003677	Holy crap.
1004458	1005619	You're the worst liar ever.
1005639	1006659	Holy crap.
1007340	1008281	So much enthusiasm.
1008641	1011423	Yeah, so Sony finally announced this system.
1011804	1015647	They've really done a great job of keeping it under wraps.
1015807	1017048	No one knew anything about it.
1017848	1020189	But apparently, yeah, it's coming out now, November 2nd.
1020209	1024369	It'll officially be $400 US for $399.99, however you want to look at it.
1025250	1030091	And, of course, there is no, you know, backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 games.
1030831	1034792	And at the same time, they've also dropped down the 80-gig system to $499.99.
1034972	1035452	So $100 cheaper.
1035472	1035652	Awesome!
1042406	1042987	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1063480	1067821	is that this has nothing to do with reducing Sony's cost of manufacturing.
1067841	1074142	People would go and speculate that, oh, they had to fit a whole PlayStation 2 in the PlayStation 3, so taking that out saves them money.
1074682	1074902	Nope.
1075543	1085104	The reason why they did this was, quote, encouraging buyers of the entry-level PlayStation 3 to purchase more games designed specifically for the new system.
1086345	1087625	You are an idiot.
1088550	1089230	I agree.
1090071	1091491	That was horrible.
1119107	1119687	C'mon!
1120768	1121589	Who let him talk?
1121709	1123130	Seriously, who let him talk?
1123770	1125932	I think Piker Uno in our chatroom would agree with you.
1125972	1130915	Chat.orange.radio.com Piker Uno says, Sony PR, please shut the fuck up.
1131355	1131775	Seriously.
1131836	1132776	Please, please, please.
1132856	1133597	C'mon!
1134397	1135378	Who let him talk?
1135738	1136519	That's what I wanted to know.
1136539	1139341	I mean, you don't... I'm sorry.
1139661	1144984	I try to be as positive as I can with these guys, but they're really making it tough on me.
1145465	1146625	I mean, seriously.
1146685	1147246	Seriously.
1148231	1158094	I thought they just came out the week before and said, okay, well, the reason why is because we removed these chips and we removed these chips so that we can cut the price a little bit so that we can drop the price of the system.
1158234	1160514	Okay, that makes sense and logic there.
1160874	1166236	But if you're just fucking with us and just removing it because you want to sell some more PlayStation 3 games...
1166776	1167816	Well then, fuck you.
1167956	1168676	I mean, seriously.
1169357	1171537	Interesting thought in our chat room.
1172277	1179899	Rob Babak says in our chat room, or it could be that Sony wants you to buy backwards compatibility from the PlayStation Network.
1181279	1182339	Oh, wouldn't that be mean?
1183539	1185040	That's really mean if that's true.
1185360	1187340	I mean, but they have said it's software-based.
1187640	1189181	That is definitely plausible.
1189261	1191101	No, because it's software-based for the PlayStation 1.
1192547	1200630	I thought it was... They had what it was, they had a chip that was running the graphics stuff for the PlayStation 2, but the motion engine was software based.
1201310	1208833	So unless they completely rewrote it to... But then didn't they get rid of, like in the European ones, didn't they get rid of that and replace it with software?
1208933	1213974	Yeah, they got rid of one of the two chips, but this 40 gig system has zero of the two chips.
1214474	1216015	So that's why it can't run anything.
1217272	1219413	It's all fucked up, however you look at it.
1219813	1223715	I mean, if they're going to make you buy backwards compatibility later on, that's also fucked up.
1224836	1228897	That's just asking for Microsoft to just come back at you with some PR spin on it.
1228977	1229738	I mean, seriously.
1230278	1231739	I'm glad I bought mine when I did.
1232079	1235740	Some days I want to go, just cut your losses and let's hear about PlayStation 4.
1238942	1239742	It's getting harder.
1239842	1242583	I'm sorry, Sony fanboys, but at the same time, I'm not.
1243264	1246225	It's like, you know, they just don't
1248614	1250956	They don't make a good case right about now, you know what I mean?
1250996	1253618	They just keep shooting themselves in the foot over and over and over.
1253658	1254538	There's nothing.
1254758	1261963	I mean, honestly, for the last few weeks, I've been really questioning whether I want to get Ratchet & Clank Future because I have it paid for.
1261983	1265365	I'm just like, maybe I want something else instead.
1265425	1267267	I can buy a 360 game with that or something.
1267927	1271269	It's just, I don't know.
1271409	1275532	I've been downloading stuff off the Japanese PlayStation Network.
1275947	1277608	They actually have some stuff to download on there.
1278948	1282549	On the bright side, maybe the price will drop again before Final Fantasy XIII comes out.
1283290	1283710	I can dream.
1283990	1284430	You know what?
1284670	1285610	Yeah, seriously.
1285850	1286111	When?
1287731	1288211	Well, what?
1288231	1293553	Final Fantasy XIII will probably come out in Japan late next year, in 2009 at the earliest.
1293573	1294994	You'll be lucky if it comes out next year.
1295434	1295674	I know.
1295774	1296594	You are lucky.
1296794	1298615	I know.
1298715	1300316	Maybe there will be another price drop before then.
1300356	1300636	Who knows?
1301056	1301336	I don't know.
1301436	1301796	Me neither.
1302056	1303937	I got stuff to play on other systems meanwhile.
1303997	1304317	It's fine.
1306021	1309703	Well, at least the few things are going to be on PlayStation Network.
1309743	1311664	There's Flow and Warhawk.
1311804	1312985	Flow is spelled with a zero.
1314126	1314626	It's leet.
1315707	1317087	Well, it's the way the game is.
1317888	1317968	Yeah.
1318328	1320349	It looks kind of electroplankton-y.
1321230	1322651	Are you saying the game is a zero?
1323151	1323891	No, I like the game.
1324031	1324692	I bought the game.
1324852	1327173	That's the only game I've bought from PlayStation Network.
1327193	1329915	Well, these are expansions that are going to be out for there.
1331072	1336436	The Flow expansion is going to have a multiplayer mode and a new playable creature.
1337557	1341841	And then Warhawk is going to be another dropship.
1343302	1345123	And you can pick up and relocate ground vehicles.
1345684	1347445	Multiplayer on Flow could be interesting.
1347946	1349647	Even though wasn't Flow more of like a...
1350231	1351711	It's not something you play.
1352272	1353012	It's ambient.
1376767	1377047	I don't know.
1377067	1380428	These minimalist games, though, sometimes are extremely popular.
1380448	1386209	If you think about it, every Xen Extra Extreme, which I was talking about earlier, there's one button in the game to blow up your ship.
1386390	1386830	Exactly.
1386990	1390231	And I don't have a problem with that game.
1390371	1392051	That's why I bought Flow.
1392731	1393471	That says a lot.
1393711	1397012	Because buying stuff off of the PlayStation Network is a bitch.
1397372	1398393	And I don't like doing it.
1398433	1398473	So...
1401694	1406936	Kiki in our chatroom says, screw Flow, get Everyday Shooter, which is a game I've heard good things about.
1406976	1410276	Well, Everyday Shooter wasn't available when Flow first became available.
1410296	1414838	But yeah, I've thought about buying that game too, because that looks good.
1415978	1423700	Anyways, another game, as I mentioned earlier, that I tried out, and it is available on the Japanese PlayStation Network, so if you don't have a Japanese account,
1424861	1428023	Create one, download it, and then you can play it on any of your accounts.
1428123	1431165	But it's Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, the demo.
1431966	1434127	So it's a demo for a demo, I guess.
1434608	1437229	Or a demo for a demo game that you're going to have to buy or something like that.
1437570	1440992	Anyways, it features, you know, a few cards.
1441052	1447977	I believe there's like, I want to say like six cards to choose from or something in the very beginning.
1449718	1454241	And there's going to be just, you know, single player stuff, no online stuff.
1456214	1457295	It's a cool looking game.
1457375	1458516	I think there's like one track.
1459497	1460858	Definitely worth checking out.
1461799	1464101	Personally, though, when this comes out, I wouldn't buy it.
1464742	1468085	But, hey, if you love Gran Turismo, get your hands on this.
1468105	1469906	What about the full game when it's released?
1470527	1471067	I wouldn't buy it.
1472809	1474971	They're talking $40 for the full game.
1475371	1475711	Fuck that.
1475791	1478334	I'll wait for the real game to come out and pay like $20 more.
1478794	1479795	I mean, what's the point?
1480967	1493112	And also, the other thing too is make sure you download Gran Turismo HD if it's even still available on the PlayStation Network because I know that they're taking that down soon when 5 comes out.
1494712	1495733	But definitely worth checking it out.
1495813	1496773	It's a cool looking game.
1497353	1498374	Just, I wouldn't buy it.
1498994	1499194	Alright.
1499854	1504236	Well, very interesting comment coming out of the San Jose Mercury News.
1505056	1509678	Dean Takahashi is a reporter for the Mercury News and talks often about video games.
1510336	1529809	and he was writing earlier this week about the latest sales number and also said this quote quote one piece of news that came out this week was that Sony pleaded with third-party developers not to abandon its struggling platform that change in attitude is a marked difference compared to the arrogance of past years
1530478	1535783	Very interesting to think that Sony could be on its knees begging people not to leave right now.
1535803	1538525	It kind of makes me go, I wonder who's thinking of jumping ship right now.
1538605	1539826	Well, it makes sense.
1539846	1541347	I mean, if you think about it, I mean, look at it.
1541367	1552397	The system has the least amount of, as far as, I hate calling it next gen, but as far as the next gen platforms, it has the least market share, at least in the U.S., and
1553157	1554158	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1580171	1590679	said the PlayStation 3 was a waste of everyone's time and could be indicating why folks are starting to jump ship and Sony's begging people to stay around.
1590819	1595722	Speaking of which, Half-Life 2, The Orange Box, and PlayStation 3 not coming out until December now.
1597344	1606310	And as some folks are speculating, if at all, if you keep getting delay, delay, delay, eventually you might start seeing canceled, canceled, canceled.
1606751	1608572	I think this holiday season could...
1609335	1610200	Make or Break Sony.
1610240	1612491	I mean, I don't want to sound all like finalists here, but
1612898	1623221	I mean, if Sony doesn't manage to sell through a lot of consoles, it's interesting because Extrofer and I, for those who didn't hear the bonus segment tonight, Extrofer and I drove to Disneyland together and we were talking about game stuff.
1623241	1629003	He was talking about how he works at a large retail chain right now that sells electronics as part of it.
1629383	1634944	And he says, you know, he's like, I'm not biased, but I'm sitting there and I'm watching.
1635004	1640406	We are selling quite a few Xbox 360, tons of Wii's I have never seen.
1641144	1648012	Now, keep in mind, he works overnights, but he sees these systems go, even in the overnight shifts, and he says, I have never seen us sell a PlayStation 3.
1648112	1652016	Well, Walmart's kind of a weird demographic.
1652637	1655240	I mean, I don't think people go buy PlayStation 3s there.
1656721	1659064	The thing... I mean, seriously, though...
1660629	1662830	I'm just taking it right now as to date.
1662850	1669034	And I was talking to you about this before the show started because kind of going back to the whole I have judgment bet that we have right now.
1669154	1682582	So far, and I was looking at the numbers after the MPD group reported on for September, year to date, the PlayStation 3, there's not been a game that's sold over 400,000 units in the United States, which isn't that great.
1682863	1689326	I mean, when you consider like Halo sold, you know, 2 million units and there's a bunch of other games that have sold millions of units and stuff like that.
1690007	1690067	Um,
1691198	1696923	300,000 or 335,000 if I remember correctly was for Resistance Fallen Man.
1698944	1699505	It's not that good.
1699965	1703848	And I know people are waiting for Metal Gear Solid 4, which is going to be an awesome game.
1704509	1707311	And that will be probably a must-have game for the PlayStation 3.
1707411	1717319	It may help them sell some units, but I think a lot of people, and hope to God that they don't announce that there's going to be an Xbox 360 version for that around the same time,
1719364	1725387	I think that may sell some units for them, but at the same time, they're going to lose out this holiday, for sure.
1725927	1726748	That's a fact.
1727548	1732331	And by the time that all these good games come around, it's going to be too late.
1732991	1733911	That's really what it's going to be.
1735932	1741495	Hope they make it, because I'd like to see all three consoles doing good, but I don't know.
1743376	1743716	I don't know.
1744597	1744877	All right.
1745934	1749095	Oh, yet again, another Sony debate here on the program.
1749155	1751156	Hey, we love to always get your perspective.
1751176	1753696	I'm sure there's some people that feel very differently about this whole issue.
1754316	1757297	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is the place to express your opinion.
1757878	1764319	And every week here on the program, we like to read your emails here on the program and respond to them, if appropriate.
1764900	1770261	So DarkSakura likes to read the emails at Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com in our Mailbag segment.
1776596	1780738	From what I understand this week, not a lot of people expressing their opinions, huh?
1781358	1781618	No.
1782098	1783539	That's too bad.
1783879	1790242	First email says, Hey, I'd really like the new segment, and I think it's fun to reminisce on old but great games.
1790782	1796565	I would actually like to request a game to be featured in this segment, Riftstar for the Sega Genesis.
1797125	1799386	It's one of my all-time favorites.
1799486	1799706	Thanks.
1799806	1800507	That's from Osfer.
1802307	1802968	Maybe one day.
1804408	1805949	I didn't really play it that much.
1806889	1808029	Well, maybe now's the time to start.
1808549	1812270	I already have a game picked up for next week, although it's really, really, really obscure.
1812790	1814211	What happens when you're out in November?
1814271	1815811	Does that mean Loki and I get to pick some games?
1816011	1816271	Sure.
1817872	1827914	Actually, I'll go ahead and tell you the one I thought about doing next week that I'm not going to do was Kaze No Regret, the real sound game that came out on the Saturn that was sound only, and you got a packet of seeds with it.
1829254	1831135	Are we going to be seeing nothing but Sega games?
1831395	1831515	No.
1831795	1832235	All right, good.
1834008	1836910	DarkSakura is going to be on vacation a couple weeks in November
1864256	1865777	We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
1866318	1873504	The last email is, Dear OLR, this is a theory that has been floating around the internets for some time, the third console curse.
1874745	1882031	Basically, this theory states that every third console by every leading publisher will ultimately fail or do significantly less better than its predecessor.
1882491	1883091	Just think about it.
1883111	1885774	The Atari 5200 was Atari's third system and it failed.
1885894	1886274	No, it didn't.
1886886	1892788	The Sega Saturn was Sega's third home system, and it slowly died because producing its motherboard was so expensive.
1893768	1895608	Also, they didn't really support it very well in the U.S.
1896289	1901950	The Nintendo 64 did not fare well due to Sony's more powerful system and CD-based media.
1902070	1902490	That's true.
1903151	1907972	And lastly, Sony and its PlayStation 3, which I need not explain, especially since we just went over it.
1908860	1915525	Although the N64 and Saturn were pretty awesome systems, you can't help but say they did fail to their rival systems in terms of sales.
1916246	1920189	I know that this argument has no base whatsoever, but I just wanted to throw this out.
1922231	1927415	Technically, the Saturn was not the third system.
1928235	1929696	The Saturn was the master system.
1929736	1936562	Master system, Genesis, Sega CD, 32X, and then this... Well, 32X I wouldn't really call a system.
1936602	1937522	It was more of an add-on.
1937563	1937963	But if...
1938539	1939500	Still, it's not 13th.
1939880	1940360	Or 5th.
1941341	1942801	So yeah, that doesn't really count.
1945243	1945583	I don't know.
1945683	1947644	I kind of want to say something controversial.
1947764	1948244	I don't know.
1948405	1949825	I'll tell you why they all failed.
1950005	1952627	Because they all appeared on the cover of Madden NFL.
1952847	1954368	That's why they all failed.
1955313	1961056	No, the controversial thing I want to say, our emailer says that Nintendo 64 was a good system with the Saturn.
1961136	1961656	I disagree.
1961676	1963557	I don't think that Nintendo 64 was a good system.
1963657	1964317	No, it was not.
1964497	1965498	It was not a good system.
1966338	1971360	The critical flaw they made in the system was that they refused to go to CD.
1971900	1976162	That was one decision that fucking killed them.
1976783	1981205	Did developers manage to make great games with a mediocre system?
1981465	1981705	Yes.
1983480	1984761	and then you go to the GameCube.
1984801	1994589	The GameCube wasn't a bad system, but the GameCube also made some key mistakes that I think make the GameCube not so great a system, honestly.
1994629	2008600	And I know there's Nintendo fanboys that are going to have their pitchfork and torches, but Nintendo 64, I think, made some key mistakes, and that was it didn't go online, it didn't play DVDs, which at the time that it came out was really an essential thing that the competitors had going.
2009238	2013842	However, I do think the Wii is a great idea and a great system, and it's nice to see Nintendo kind of go in a different direction.
2013862	2016624	But I would argue Nintendo 64 was not a good system.
2016765	2018526	You mean the Nintendo GameCube?
2019827	2020047	Both.
2020488	2022109	Yeah.
2023410	2023731	I don't know.
2024111	2032879	Just they really – hopefully with the Wii, I hate going back – go online, Nintendo.
2033159	2033980	Seriously, go online.
2034000	2034380	Go online.
2036361	2041585	I'm giving them a chance because they're repeating their cycle of the DS which worked for them.
2041645	2044687	They're slowly, they're unboxing it slowly.
2045708	2047669	Online will come into Nintendo in 08.
2049250	2051712	You already see it starting to happen with Mario Kart and stuff.
2052072	2055695	Just like it did on the DS, Mario Kart launched the whole online thing on the DS.
2056195	2059438	So, I mean, do I think they're behind?
2059618	2059898	Yes.
2059978	2061900	Do I think their system is better than
2064108	2064969	at Microsoft.
2065089	2071373	Certainly not, but it's better than nothing, which is pretty much what the GameCube had save one game.
2071833	2072774	Well, there's more to the email.
2072994	2073234	Sorry.
2074435	2076437	By the way, you guys are too self-depreciating.
2076777	2081300	This show is ten times better than any other podcast I've listened to because your personalities work so well together.
2082220	2088905	All the other podcasts just give me the straight news with limited opinions, which meticulously sidestep criticizing sponsors.
2089325	2093108	On OLR, I get my news mixed in with a little bit of Dirty Sanchez and Broadway show tunes.
2093922	2095223	You guys are effing kick-ass.
2095323	2095643	Heon.
2096023	2099945	Oh, we didn't have any PlayStation 3 show tunes tonight amongst all those Sony news.
2100365	2100946	Maybe next week.
2100966	2101766	Let's see.
2101866	2106289	No, I know, but the... Remember the week we had the Sony was marketing with show tunes?
2106569	2107829	Was this last week or two weeks ago?
2107950	2108690	Anyway.
2108730	2109110	Ah, forget it.
2109971	2110351	Thank you.
2110371	2111772	Oh, and someone sent a spam, too.
2112672	2113432	We don't care, though.
2113893	2114133	Hooray.
2114153	2115193	I don't like spam.
2115233	2115273	Um...
2117944	2119305	Thanks, appreciate the email.
2119385	2125590	Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that we've just been doing this so long, we've almost become jaded to an extent, but in a good way, you know?
2125931	2126611	We're honest.
2127112	2129794	We've been doing this underground for a long time.
2129914	2132956	Sponsors don't, we have to beg people to come on our show.
2133277	2139342	People don't come knocking on our door like they do for the big box sites that have magazines and all that things attached to them.
2139742	2145767	And honestly, I think that's what our listeners enjoy, the fact that we're pretty much just like you, only we have microphones.
2146815	2148036	I guess that's pretty much it.
2172375	2172675	I don't know.
2172735	2184738	But according to Electronic Entertainment Designer Research, they suggest that Xbox 360 Achievement Systems, called Accomplishments, I guess in the report, had an effect on the title's success.
2185818	2195540	According to the press release, there is a strong connection between a game's title's diversity of accomplishment types and what the game's profitability was.
2196620	2197620	I don't buy that one bit.
2198720	2201621	I mean, it doesn't mean anything.
2202349	2203029	To me, at least.
2203049	2207571	You don't think the achievement whores have enough of the market share?
2208652	2212814	I think achievement points get people to buy games that they would not necessarily buy.
2212894	2225360	Like, I know, for example, I bought Xbox Live Arcade games thinking, oh, hey, I can get some pretty easy achievements off there, and I would buy them and then find out, yeah, they suck, and those achievements are a lot harder to get.
2225760	2231803	I don't think that, if anything, I would think that the less achievements a game has, the better it'd sell.
2232519	2239601	Well, for achievement whores at least, because if there's one achievement to give me 1,000 points or something, all I do is beat the game.
2239881	2246303	But a lot of the true achievement whores use Gamefly or one of those rental services anyway.
2246383	2247603	Rent the game, get the points, send it back.
2247623	2248023	Exactly.
2248043	2249584	I think it's just a coincidence.
2249844	2254445	And I think that's just a trend that a lot of games are coming out and have more achievements.
2254545	2256646	But I don't know.
2256666	2261047	It's cool that the achievements are in there, but I don't think it really has anything to do.
2261582	2263323	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2291600	2292540	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2319545	2322646	We were watching the Bollywood Awards last night.
2322706	2325067	Yeah, we went to Indian Food today, actually, for lunch.
2325107	2330988	We had a little Jamie Robb brunch at the Indian Food place, and they were watching some award, and they were doing some of the musicals.
2331008	2331809	I got that guy's name.
2331829	2332709	And some of it's catchy.
2333289	2334029	I got that guy's name.
2334169	2334529	What is it?
2334669	2335910	I'm glad that you got to see that performance.
2336130	2336930	Akshay Kumar.
2337590	2339551	Sadly, he is not in this game.
2339571	2342352	That's sad, because that was a freaking good performance.
2342692	2342972	All right.
2343012	2344292	But that would be cool.
2344492	2346993	See, I would get that if we would get a release over here.
2347563	2348584	Well, who knows?
2349265	2351146	Write some emails, make some demands.
2351667	2352668	You never know what might happen.
2353488	2359674	Anyway, the full song list is floating around out there, but I do notice certain artists are repeated several times in the game.
2360494	2361095	So check that out.
2361175	2364798	I think those are the actual movies and not the artists.
2365539	2366400	Oh, that would make sense.
2366860	2367240	I gotcha.
2367941	2368922	Oh, so these are the productions.
2369022	2369282	Okay.
2369582	2372525	So there's quite a few there from Calho Naho, that movie.
2373421	2387026	DarkTetsuya in chatroom says we need to import this game for Loki I don't know, Loki, feel like singing some Bollywood?
2387627	2398651	I don't feel like singing anything I'm actually posting that website to the chatroom because my impromptu website of the week alright, it lives
2400313	2407716	So at any rate, in other news, there is still going to be a Golden Axe update.
2409376	2425602	It will be Golden Axe Beast Rider, which is exclusive for Xbox 360, and they are talking about them going to be a PS3 version, but it may not be the same one, but it's supposed to be a Golden Axe RPG.
2427267	2430708	I heard that both of those games are coming out in the spring of next year.
2430728	2432448	I think February or March.
2432468	2435189	Well, that makes happy because I like Golden Axe.
2436349	2439330	But I didn't see the Beast Rider thing on there or anything like that.
2439990	2442351	But who knows?
2442571	2443431	That's kind of cool at least.
2445912	2447812	Anywho, so let's see here.
2448373	2459419	There's some other interesting stuff that was floating around the web this week, including a mod for the PC version of Half-Life 2, which includes the Portal gun from, of course, Portal.
2459899	2461440	And it looks pretty awesome.
2462060	2468083	Of course, all the fun things you would imagine you can do with a Portal gun, including throwing grenades through it and whatnot.
2468243	2470344	But who knows?
2470444	2474626	Maybe we'll see some multiplayer mods for Portal as well.
2476227	2477348	Or maybe an official release.
2478714	2480415	Lots of love in our chat room, by the way.
2480435	2486820	I noticed before the show started tonight, we had a lot of people in chat just spilling out their love for Portal, which is a game I have yet to play.
2486860	2493906	You need to bring it over, Loki, because I don't want to spend all that money for the Orange Box, because I've been buying too many games lately.
2494006	2500031	Nothing against the folks at the Orange Box, but we need to share our resources here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2500231	2501112	But I do want to play Portal.
2501132	2502133	I've heard a lot of good things about it.
2502719	2503280	The Cake is a Lie
2516817	2517337	Thank you for watching!
2538906	2542450	You know, they've got Pokemon everything out there this day and age, right?
2542490	2546734	They've got, you know, the Pokemon, obviously, look at my collection of stuffed animals up here.
2546774	2550257	You've got the Pokemon, the Pikachus I have, little stuffed Jigglypuffs.
2550558	2555242	You can get them on mugs, shirts, hell, probably underoos with Pokemon on them too.
2555663	2559406	But now you can get Pokemon perfume.
2560667	2561208	That's right.
2561656	2564918	You can smell like Pikachu, I guess.
2565498	2566199	Peek-a-poo!
2567179	2571241	It's made by AirVal International is the name of the group that puts this out.
2571602	2573923	It'll cost you $15 US.
2574123	2578145	Please do not buy this for your children because there's enough stinky perfume in the world, thank you.
2579926	2583308	I wish sometimes the internet had a scratch and sniff thing on it because I'm kind of curious.
2583688	2585529	What does Pikachu perfume smell like?
2586150	2588091	It's probably just some kind of generic scent.
2588531	2588791	I don't know.
2589441	2592622	I think that almost all perfume smells nasty, though, but I'm allergic to it.
2592842	2596964	Now, FootyMonster would like to point out, when I was a kid, you could get Transformers perfume, Skye.
2597004	2599905	It's not that rare to see perfumes of the popular franchises.
2600725	2601625	Yeah, but still.
2601965	2602426	Come on.
2603666	2604246	Come on.
2604706	2605967	Pikachu perfume?
2606727	2607107	I don't know.
2608628	2609008	Whatever.
2609508	2611489	Son of Dad thinks they should make Pokemon Lube.
2611509	2611549	Ew.
2611849	2611949	Ew.
2613249	2613549	No.
2613790	2614390	Do not want.
2614630	2615170	Do not want.
2615959	2645028	Skype line is open for business 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio go ahead and give us a call and anything you want to talk about that we've talked about on this week's show or maybe there's a story that you want to talk about that we didn't get to tonight because actually in our choosing stories threads behind the scenes there's quite a lot of stories that didn't make the cut tonight I'm sure Loki will be getting to some of them though in last minute stories so Loki while we wait for some calls why don't we go over some last minute stories okay
2646129	2649530	There is one interesting thing, real briefly.
2650170	2654031	There is a Mass Effect Limited Edition coming out.
2654231	2658953	It's only going to be available online, only through EB and GameStop, which is kind of weird.
2659673	2661434	But, I don't know.
2661534	2663454	It comes out the same day, so November 20th.
2665515	2666335	Let's see here.
2667415	2671596	Then there was some other stuff, I guess, coming from Nintendo Power.
2672057	2673617	That was Chris Slate
2674164	2683692	He was saying that there's going to be a brand new online community coming soon from Nintendo Power because, remember, they closed the Insider Forums at one time.
2685113	2693079	Also, another interesting thing from the Simpsons game, which is, of course, being put out by EA, Grand Theft Scratch is no more.
2693159	2695601	They've made the change to name to Mob Rules now.
2695681	2697563	So apparently those lawsuit things were working.
2698444	2698764	Wow.
2699224	2699805	All right.
2700325	2701226	I just lost the call.
2701266	2703107	We had a call coming in on Skype and I missed it.
2703167	2703448	Damn it.
2703628	2703708	No.
2704079	2704559	I have a story.
2704579	2705640	Alright, sure, Jamie, real quick.
2707201	2718087	Flint Dill, I guess that's how his last name is pronounced, was one of the writers for Riddick, and he's working on the Sin City game, and he and Frank Miller are working together on it.
2718187	2721729	And the quote says, Frank and I have been having a party coming up with nasty stuff for the game.
2722430	2729454	In true Sin City fashion, some old characters will return, new characters will appear, and without giving anything away, probably die horribly.
2730307	2733249	Well, I don't know if the game is going to be anything like the movie.
2733289	2735750	I'm sure I will feel it is all style and no substance.
2735790	2738292	I saw a little bit of the movie, and I thought it was horrible.
2738852	2741533	Not my favorite movie in the world, but it's certainly pretty to look at.
2741593	2743375	Hey, we're finally getting some calls on the Skype line.
2743815	2744855	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
2744875	2745276	Who's this?
2746476	2746816	Hey, guys.
2746837	2747237	What's up?
2747457	2748077	This is Footy Monster.
2748257	2749058	Hi, Footy Monster.
2749078	2749598	How are you doing?
2751179	2751539	Not too bad.
2751559	2751919	Not too bad.
2752320	2753220	What about you guys?
2753380	2755802	I noticed that last week you had quite a hectic show.
2755862	2757302	Can you sort it all out?
2757323	2758083	Sure.
2758910	2760311	Last week's show was very interesting.
2760371	2763253	We had surprise guests, surprise outages.
2764294	2767396	Chris was here, of course we love Chris, and Puppy was here, which was awesome.
2768276	2779624	And then we had, you know, the show didn't get started for 40 minutes, or no, it was 20 minutes it took us to get the show started because two, I'm sorry, in our studio we used to have four mics.
2780546	2782027	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2808005	2832758	and so oh my gosh it was just horrible but we fixed it we went and we got a new cable and a new microphone and everything's hunky-dory again and we're up to four microphones which is going to be great for our guests so very happy and then of course our internet went out during part b so uh we had no live element last week which kind of sucked but then we did the operator 11 stuff the bonus show we did which was really cool by the way yeah we actually had a lot of fun doing it and we're kind of doing it again tonight
2833548	2838692	Even for the podcast listeners, if you go to Operator11.com a little later, you're actually going to see our Guitar Hero 3 preview.
2838712	2846397	We're going to unbox the demo kit and show you guys the guitar and the changeable faceplate, and to show you guys all the insies and outsies of Guitar Hero 3 a little later on this evening.
2846497	2849719	So for those of you listening on the podcast, check that out at Operator11.com.
2851120	2852141	I'll definitely be there checking it out.
2852321	2852601	Thank you.
2853321	2854222	Is that all you wanted to ask?
2854282	2854682	Nope.
2854842	2862387	No, I actually had a little comment from the dark side, because God might grab a little pause on Music Jam, Hamilton and Music Jam.
2862708	2863068	Oh, what's up?
2864554	2866717	Good news for Loki, it is not that pink and fluffy.
2866977	2869280	Like, seriously?
2884725	2891190	The only time you see the face of the girl and all the pinkness is at the beginning, like you see the splash screen.
2891591	2895794	But other than that, the game is pretty normal, low-key with the girliness.
2895954	2897255	So I guess that's a good thing.
2897935	2906040	But what's interesting is that the way it's set up, like, when you start the game, you don't have the freedom to choose, for instance, to play just the drums or to play just the bass guitar.
2906480	2907861	You're supposed to make the song.
2908121	2916025	So, because of that, you first have to play the lead guitar and, like, make the rhythm, which you can record, you have metronomes, so you can do everything.
2916465	2917946	And it's really like jam sessions.
2918166	2926171	Like, you press the D-pad and you select the chords, you have a whole selection of chords, but you can't customize the chords like you can in jam sessions, so that's a
2926861	2928922	for jam sessions, but not for Hannah Montana.
2929703	2953475	But then once you're done recording your lead guitar, which it's not just strumming, you can also pick individual strings, which is pretty good, then you can record a bass with individual strings for strumming, you can record a guitar for little solos and stuff, and you can even do the whammy bar and all that stuff, so it's really interesting, it's really feature complete.
2953935	2955156	And then Drunk Kid,
2955731	2960635	The drum kit you can play with two styluses if you want, so you have sort of like two little drumsticks.
2961015	2962857	Or you can use the whole DSL buttons.
2962897	2967340	Every button is signed for the drum stuff.
2967781	2972685	So you can press B, and it does the big drum thingy.
2972725	2975847	And if you press the D-pad, it does the hi-hat and stuff like that.
2976448	2984454	Is there like a plot or a stage set up, or is it just like jam sessions where you just kind of rock out?
2985666	2996894	Yeah, but you know, it's funny that you can then take, like, your song, and there's an option to make it music video, which, it features Hannah Montana, you can change the camera around, make her play, make her dance around.
2998155	3005160	Yeah, I mean, seriously, I mean, it's like, it's a feature that's not there, which you might not like, but it's so much more feature-complete, I'm surprised.
3005721	3005921	Hmm.
3006724	3018088	Well, you've definitely become the unofficial spokesperson for the Hannah Montana franchise here on the show, so I'm curious to hear if some of our listeners actually go out and pick up this game and what they also think of it.
3018308	3020449	It's only $20, though.
3020729	3023009	It's only $20, so not too bad a bargain.
3023369	3027471	Well, hey, we've got to let you go to let some other folks on, but thank you so much for your call, and have fun with the Hannah Montana.
3028551	3028871	All right.
3029311	3030072	Take care.
3030112	3030372	Take care.
3032608	3039450	If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3040190	3042951	Meanwhile, any more last minute stories over yonder, over hither?
3043491	3045691	Yeah, some interesting things.
3046432	3052433	There is a new Logitech PC controller that apparently works perfectly on the PlayStation 3.
3055454	3056814	I don't know, it's kind of interesting.
3056854	3059075	I guess a dual action gamepad is what it is.
3059827	3064951	But it works on the PlayStation 3, which is kind of surprising that a PC controller would work on it.
3065972	3069335	And then another thing, which is kind of funny you just mentioned it.
3069796	3072098	Apparently, Gran Turismo 5 is not really 1080p.
3073178	3074079	Let's go to another call.
3074139	3075220	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3075240	3075581	Who's this?
3076521	3077102	Hey, what's up?
3077122	3077963	This is Ryoma.
3078523	3079164	Hey, Ryoma.
3079204	3080064	What's on your mind, buddy?
3081626	3082266	Nothing much.
3082647	3086470	It was actually something that I was kind of interested in asking you guys.
3087102	3090525	I've been passive on a Super Metroid care recently.
3090725	3093187	It's probably one of my favorite Super Nintendo games.
3093908	3098091	But, I mean, obviously one of the fascinations with the games is the speedrun element.
3098211	3101854	So I just wanted to know, like, what do you guys think of speedrun?
3102495	3104877	I don't think I've ever heard you mention anything about it.
3105117	3107459	So, like, what are your opinions on speedrunning in games?
3108228	3109548	I'm sorry, run that by me one more time.
3110068	3112329	You said Super Metroid and what?
3112349	3113909	Because you're a little bit fuzzy.
3114009	3115570	So say that again.
3115590	3118690	You want to know our opinion on... Speedrunning.
3119890	3121151	Oh, speedrunning.
3121311	3122591	Speedrunning through the games.
3122971	3123451	Oh, yes.
3123511	3124331	Speedruns are great.
3124731	3126172	They're fun to watch on YouTube.
3126292	3127252	I'm not very good at it.
3127572	3128552	Actually, that's not true.
3129052	3132373	I have, just for shits and giggles, played through Mario Bros.
3132413	3134793	like as fast as I freaking... I mean, Super Mario Bros.
3134813	3137414	obviously is as fast as I can just to kind of like...
3137762	3138863	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3158925	3160646	The 8-1 level of Super Mario Bros.
3161667	3163589	blindfolded, that was during a speedrun.
3163949	3165550	Wow, that's awesome.
3165650	3177539	Well, it's because the whole level, if you don't, I mean, you can stop and try to get all the points, but if you're trying to have a full-time, well, it's close to a full-time by the time you get to the end of the thing, and not get hit by anything, it's a definite pattern to the whole level.
3178480	3181162	So that was, it was during a speedrun that I did it blindfolded.
3181482	3185625	I probably couldn't do it since, since I haven't touched the game in five years, but, you know.
3186314	3191837	and certainly a game like Super Metroid encourages you to do speedruns because you know you want the bra and panties shot at the end.
3192217	3195559	So in order to get that, you have to go through the game kind of as fast as you can.
3196639	3208085	And some folks in chatroom getting in on the conversation as well, TigerClaw says, the thing about Metroid speedruns is they do a lot of sequence breaking, basically collecting all the items and powerups out of order.
3208485	3214928	And the thing about the original Metroid as well, I know you don't have to have this item to beat the game, but it helps, but the screw attack...
3215228	3215588	No, not really.
3215608	3218310	I personally think that speedrunning kind of takes the enjoyment out of the game.
3243402	3250030	I mean, I understand if, like, somebody loves a game to the point where they can just play through it really insanely quickly.
3250070	3256397	Like, I can do that with Mega Man X. I can beat Mega Man X when I was really good at it in about half an hour.
3256417	3261463	I mean, to me it just kind of sucks the enjoyment out of the game.
3261503	3261763	I don't know.
3262697	3263737	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3287639	3288860	because there's different ways to play the game.
3288880	3295183	There's also the complete anal retentive gameplay, which is me on any role-playing game.
3295323	3296764	I search everything.
3296904	3298305	I talk to everybody.
3298845	3310951	But I finish most of those games with some type of 100% completion or something like that because I'm so freaking anal retentive in my RPGs because I feel like I'm missing out on the story or I'm missing something important if I don't do it.
3311291	3313412	So that's like the complete opposite of a speedrun.
3313693	3316254	But I think that's one way you can certainly enjoy a game as well, right?
3318519	3320480	Yeah, I understand that.
3320961	3322602	I've never been one of those guys, personally.
3322963	3324664	Yeah, you're probably somewhere in the middle.
3324744	3325305	Most people are.
3325925	3326226	Yeah.
3327287	3328588	Well, very cool.
3328848	3329168	You're right.
3329449	3332291	We haven't talked about speedrunning a lot on the show, but there you go.
3332592	3333773	That's why we invite the calls.
3333913	3336215	They get us to talk about things we may not normally talk about.
3337036	3338957	So, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3339538	3340579	Yeah, one more thing.
3340659	3342741	For the love of God, don't buy boogies.
3343564	3344645	Don't buy Boogie.
3344705	3346346	Why should I stay the hell away from Boogie?
3346526	3348248	Because it's a terrible game.
3348868	3350109	What about it is so terrible?
3351050	3351711	Wait, say that again?
3352091	3353412	What about it is so terrible?
3354673	3356194	The karaoke is terrible.
3356334	3358816	It's a very simple game.
3359937	3361639	I found absolutely no enjoyment in it.
3362439	3368844	So, I mean, maybe there's some rhythm game, like super hardcore rhythm aficionado out there that'll love Boogie.
3369045	3372187	I didn't, so... Or maybe a 12-year-old girl somewhere.
3373068	3373148	Uh...
3373812	3376855	Rob in our chat room agrees with you.
3376875	3378276	He says, Boogie is a doorstop.
3378316	3379377	You can't adjust timing.
3380858	3381678	It's a doorstop.
3382459	3382719	Nice.
3383440	3383780	All right.
3383820	3387863	Well, Ryoma, thanks so much for the call, and stay the hell away from Boogie, everybody.
3389265	3389565	Amen.
3389705	3389965	All right.
3390065	3390646	Have a good one, buddy.
3391346	3391686	You too.
3392687	3393088	All right.
3393168	3395790	So a very cold review for Boogie.
3396130	3398252	By the way, just be prepared.
3398612	3402135	If you're going to call in and tell us that a game sucks, we are going to ask you why.
3402614	3404195	GS68 When are you guys bringing back guys on the show?
3432276	3434517	Our spin-off show is on Orange Lounge Radio.
3434557	3435657	That's a very good question.
3435717	3436697	When are we bringing back?
3437358	3440058	You know, our spin-off shows have been having a lot of trauma lately.
3440098	3444180	Unfortunately, Jamie's computer went poof, so that kind of screwed our Tuesday show.
3444640	3447120	Extifer moved, which kind of screwed our Wednesday show.
3447421	3449881	Our Thursday show is still going, STFU.
3450641	3451322	Actually, no.
3452262	3458244	Like, sometimes I drop by to listen to STFU, but, like, nothing happens.
3458264	3458524	Uh-oh.
3459673	3465518	Well, I'll have to get on our buddy up in Washington, Insanest, and see what's going on with that.
3466079	3470683	I would say probably our weeknight shows are going to be in a bit of limbo.
3470723	3473125	We're just kind of focusing everything on the Sunday shows right now.
3473566	3485597	But I'm hoping around the time when we can kind of re-energize our website, because our website's falling apart too, kind of around the same time we're able to give that a kick in the ass, which I'm hoping will be by year's end.
3486038	3486638	DarkSakura.com
3511300	3511981	If I ever do.
3512321	3513362	I hope you do.
3513542	3517946	And you also were tossing around, I don't know if I can even say, but there was another show idea.
3518146	3519508	Working on it.
3519928	3520368	Working on it.
3520749	3526914	So I'm hoping 2008, in the early stages of that, we can really refocus.
3526954	3531799	But for right now, we're making sure our Sunday show is staying consistent and doing this.
3532199	3533500	So that's all we got.
3534902	3536143	Besides, I have a classroom...
3538105	3564126	53645 and it takes me around 15 to 30 minutes to get back to my house from my campus so it's hard it'll be hard to catch guys on the show if I wanted to well I can tell you that the shows that don't use licensed music as a part of it may we may be looking into doing more podcasting you know STFU is being podcast for a little bit there we're thinking about it so it's very possible
3564878	3565458	You may see that.
3565698	3566819	So you can listen whenever you want.
3567579	3569640	Because hell, everybody podcasts these days.
3571080	3573201	Well, I don't listen to podcasts anymore.
3573421	3574841	I like the live experience better.
3575141	3582104	I agree the live experience is ten times better, which is why we do this, and I think is part of what sets us apart from a lot of other folks that do this.
3583924	3590827	You know, the live element is great, and I can't imagine doing a tape show, at least not right now.
3591447	3591767	I don't know.
3592387	3592667	Who knows?
3592767	3593608	It's a whole other challenge.
3595293	3602679	Alright, well GS68, thanks so much for the call and thanks for being such a fan of the station and calling us on our crap when we're missing out on the stuff we should be doing.
3604081	3604541	No problem.
3604621	3605782	Alright, take care buddy.
3606603	3606843	See ya.
3607043	3607364	Bye bye.
3610026	3611827	Our website does need some help badly.
3612908	3617833	I seem to remember like a long time ago we got some offer from a website design company in our mailbag.
3617873	3618653	We should have taken it.
3618753	3619474	I don't know why we didn't.
3620874	3622335	DarkSakura and Loki for all their help.
3622355	3622395	So...
3649205	3653686	I don't see the phone ringing anymore, but let's see if there's any more last-minute stories, and I'll see if we get any other calls.
3654527	3658508	Okay, other fun stuff about that beautiful Katamari download content that we talked about earlier.
3658968	3660108	They're just keys.
3660188	3664910	All that info is already in the game, so you're just unlocking the ability to play it.
3665410	3666790	Hooray!
3667551	3670812	You gotta love it when game companies do that.
3671012	3671792	Let's see what else.
3672372	3672552	Let's...
3677082	3681945	There should be some type of ban on being able to call that downloadable content.
3681985	3685247	That's not downloadable content when it's already on the disc.
3685347	3687328	That is unlocked content.
3687828	3689529	That is pay to unlock content.
3689890	3694772	I think we should start a movement that we are not going to refer to that stuff as downloadable content anymore.
3695453	3696353	Let's call it what it is.
3696413	3698134	It's pay to unlock content.
3700096	3701717	Anyway, just wanted to start a revolution.
3701937	3702417	Never mind me.
3703817	3704277	Rocket Whores
3732918	3746344	Laser Lovers, Children, Campers, Hip Slinging Snipers, Achievement Whores, Deserters, Heavy Brothers, and I guess that's it.
3748405	3748745	Alrighty.
3749545	3752026	Well, I guess that's... Oh, Heavy Breathers, my mistake.
3752647	3753347	That makes more sense.
3754088	3761890	I guess that's going to go ahead and do it for us tonight, wrap up, because we do want to get out of here at somewhat a reasonable hour because we're going to be doing the Guitar Hero 3 thing in a little bit.
3762270	3764190	So we're going to wrap it up and say goodnight.
3764650	3767671	But in order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.
3768591	3769571	We'll start with Loki tonight.
3769611	3770391	Loki, your final thought.
3771992	3775953	My final thought is there's a lot of games coming out soon.
3776833	3777453	I need more money.
3778693	3782954	My final thought is root beer is delicious, but root beer floats are even better.
3783484	3785625	Ooh, but Dole Whip floats are the best.
3786846	3787987	DarkSakura, your final thought?
3789948	3790488	I don't have one.
3791789	3793770	Abstaining tonight from the final thought process.
3794150	3794650	That's okay.
3794750	3794891	No.
3795191	3795571	It's a free country.
3795591	3796211	I just don't have one.
3796952	3797232	All right.
3797912	3798272	Fair enough.
3800254	3805897	Well, thank you guys very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent radio by...
