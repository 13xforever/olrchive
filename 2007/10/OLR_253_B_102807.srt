00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:14,743
[SPEAKER_06]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:19,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:27,736
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, October the 28th, 2007 for this Part B of our program.

5
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:34,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And since we already talked about our gaming weeks and all that stuff in Part A, you can hear about my injury and all that fun stuff.

6
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:37,818
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to go back in the archives, though, and grab Part A because we're already in the second half.

7
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:40,398
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the second half, we started off with gaming news.

8
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:41,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what do you got for us?

9
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:44,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, what I got for you is a...

10
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:49,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Brand new thing they're adding to the Wii Virtual Console.

11
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:53,095
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the ability to give games as gifts, apparently.

12
00:00:53,235 --> 00:01:03,960
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can purchase a Virtual Console game and then put one of your friend's names on there and it will automatically send them a message allowing them to download the game.

13
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:11,224
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of cool, except it doesn't address the fact that what if the person already has the game?

14
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:12,324
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what I want to know.

15
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,385
[SPEAKER_07]: What if somebody tries to send me a game which I already have?

16
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Too bad, I guess.

17
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:16,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

18
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:29,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they should have the option where you can send, and this should be in all, I think, the online things, at least Microsoft, they should have an option where you can send people points.

19
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:31,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Without having to go buy one of those cards that's taxed?

20
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:33,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Example.

21
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:39,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my account on Live, and then I have those four other Xbox 360s.

22
00:01:39,117 --> 00:01:39,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Say I want to

23
00:01:42,438 --> 00:01:44,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Download a map or something on all of them.

24
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:48,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to fucking have to put in billing information for five different 360s.

25
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:55,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd rather just send the 200 points it costs to buy this map to each one.

26
00:01:55,703 --> 00:01:56,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why you can't do that.

27
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:58,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't you just tie it to your live name and then go on each?

28
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,686
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because you have to have a different name for each one.

29
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:03,846
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be tied to that account.

30
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:05,227
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stupid.

31
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:06,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

32
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:07,411
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah.

33
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:15,154
[SPEAKER_08]: So this basically sounds like it's something that's in the very early stages that they haven't really mapped out how you're going to give the gifts or any of that yet, right?

34
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:15,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

35
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:21,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't there supposed to be some massive Wii update last month that didn't actually end up happening?

36
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:22,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

37
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think it'll be here in time for the holiday season, which is just around the corner?

38
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:26,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope so.

39
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:27,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope they have that.

40
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:34,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of curious what they're plotting, because you know how Nintendo likes to slowly pull off the wrapping on things, you know what I mean?

41
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:35,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

42
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:42,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anyhow, one thing that's getting the wrapping pulled off of it this week is Virtual Console in Japan.

43
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:44,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Virtual Console releases come out in Japan on Tuesdays.

44
00:02:45,357 --> 00:02:57,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And this week in Japan, they got a little game called Downtown Nekitsu Koshinyoku Soriyuki Dayo Kodai.

45
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what that is.

46
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:00,372
[SPEAKER_08]: And what would you call that?

47
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:01,732
[SPEAKER_03]: River City Ransom

48
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:11,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it might have been.

49
00:03:37,463 --> 00:03:40,545
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of interesting there that... Wait a minute, Sega Channel?

50
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:45,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, what kind of thing does this open up the Virtual Console to?

51
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:47,070
[SPEAKER_08]: How about some Nintendo Channel releases?

52
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Or what do they call that?

53
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:52,053
[SPEAKER_08]: The... Was it the BS or something?

54
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:53,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the Teleview.

55
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:54,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's Teleview, that's it.

56
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:55,776
[SPEAKER_08]: BS is what it was for short.

57
00:03:56,356 --> 00:04:03,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um... That would be cool if we got like the Zelda remake over here and that kind of stuff, but... I've played a ROM of it.

58
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:06,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'm just dreaming a little bit, I don't know.

59
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:10,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for our friends in the UK, they get some cool stuff.

60
00:04:11,227 --> 00:04:15,568
[SPEAKER_03]: The coolest being Yoshi's Story that was on the Nintendo 64 for 1,000 Wii Points.

61
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:19,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Yoshi's Story was a very, very cute game.

62
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:20,428
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say.

63
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:24,649
[SPEAKER_03]: And, as I mentioned in Part A, Super Air Zonk!

64
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:29,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Rockabilly Paradise, which was a Turbo CD shooter.

65
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,151
[SPEAKER_03]: They've removed a few of the graphical features to it.

66
00:04:35,530 --> 00:05:00,102
[SPEAKER_03]: and they have uh instead uh basically just beefed up the soundtrack a bit so super Arizona and also magician lord 900 points it's a neo geo game i have yet to download a neo geo game onto my wii i just i don't know i get magician lord i kind of want it but i don't know like

67
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:06,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Magician Lord is one of those games that are like, ooh, it was so awesome, and then I downloaded it.

68
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:06,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten years ago.

69
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:08,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, this wasn't that good.

70
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,648
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell was I thinking on that?

71
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:11,289
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember it being very hard.

72
00:05:11,309 --> 00:05:15,431
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like how Virtual Console does all of its business, is off of reactions like that.

73
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:16,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh, remember this game?

74
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:17,893
[SPEAKER_08]: This game was awesome.

75
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you download it, and you're like, wait, no it wasn't.

76
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:22,336
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why they don't have demos.

77
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:24,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, probably.

78
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,638
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we still need to do Super Metroid, Rob.

79
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:27,499
[SPEAKER_08]: We do.

80
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's make it happen.

81
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

82
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't do a lot of physical stuff this week thanks to my injury, so maybe we'll have to do it this week.

83
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, no, no, no, GS68 said it.

84
00:05:36,055 --> 00:05:37,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Blazing Star on Wii.

85
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:41,079
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one of my favorite ever Neo Geo games.

86
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:45,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Polestar was a good game, but Blazing Star was freaking awesome.

87
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:46,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Someday.

88
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:54,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently there's a rumor going around that Nintendo is planning on adding flash card support to the Nintendo DS.

89
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:57,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I'm sure that many people know that there is flash card support for the DS online,

90
00:05:58,464 --> 00:06:02,507
[SPEAKER_07]: in a not-so-official, not-entirely-legal way.

91
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:27,448
[SPEAKER_07]: But the rumor is that they're going to be offering this as part of a download service that will allow you to put Game Boy and Game Boy Color games onto your DS, say, maybe via, I don't know, Virtual Console or something like that, where you can download your games using the little SD memory card, pop it out of your Wii, plug it into your DS, and take it on the go.

92
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:29,478
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

93
00:06:55,676 --> 00:07:23,137
[SPEAKER_07]: but who knows, maybe Jamie will be able to get Kid Dracula through the service that might be kind of cool for her actually I'd want to play it too here's a problem though I see with this and I don't know how it would work is how would you be able to say if I put a copy of Super Mario Land or something like that on my memory stick or whatever and Super Mario Land will be one of those games and I'm sure it was better when I was a kid let's say I put it on my SD memory card

94
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:26,455
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that card going to know which DS is going into?

95
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:31,479
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, basically that would allow you to rip the ROMs and just distribute them freely.

96
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:36,442
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be hard for them to be able to lock that down to one DS.

97
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:39,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't it just beam the game over the Wi-Fi?

98
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:43,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the DS has no internal memory to store the game.

99
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:46,589
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once it's beamed over the Wi-Fi, you save it to the...

100
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:47,607
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

101
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you link it up with a unique ID, like a friend code type thing?

102
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:50,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

103
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:51,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know.

104
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:55,670
[SPEAKER_07]: If you save it to, like... Maybe the friend code thing could work, I guess.

105
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

106
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,531
[SPEAKER_07]: It would still be very hard.

107
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:58,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

108
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:00,171
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

109
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:05,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, coming out on the Nintendo Wii is a sequel to a very obscure game.

110
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:07,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if a lot of folks know about this...

111
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:09,047
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

112
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:38,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know it's a joke on that show because they have that sound effect, the, oh no, whenever you fall off the building, right?

113
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:39,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, get this.

114
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:42,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy Climber is being remade for the Wii.

115
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:46,206
[SPEAKER_08]: And this just struck me as very odd when I read about it.

116
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:46,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, really?

117
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:47,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

118
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:50,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of all the games they could pick, they're remaking Crazy Climber.

119
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:51,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's publishing that?

120
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:56,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy Climber is being made by Nihon Busan is doing the publisher there.

121
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy Climber Wii is coming out.

122
00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:07,074
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of looks interesting from the screenshots, but you actually use the Wii remote and the nunchuck to climb up the building, which is kind of an interesting concept, you have to say.

123
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:13,976
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing that scares me about this, though, is the fact that they have a game like Impossible Mission and they also had Spy Game

124
00:09:17,555 --> 00:09:18,136
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?

125
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Elevator Mission or some shit like that?

126
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:22,099
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really crappy.

127
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can pick different characters from the game to play as.

128
00:09:30,146 --> 00:09:34,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's this one character called Fox who looks to be a foxy little girl.

129
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:35,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Or actually, big girl.

130
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:42,016
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, kind of a little spin on the 80s thing where the 80s thing only had the one guy.

131
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:45,679
[SPEAKER_08]: And somebody actually in chat has posted the link to the clip.

132
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:46,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no!

133
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:46,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy Climber

134
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:24,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm thinking about modding my Wii, and this comes out in Japan on December 20th, so, you know, I'll be able to play Region 3 soon.

135
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:29,235
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't get locked out with some future dashboard update, be careful, or whatever they call it.

136
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, that was 360, but whatever, the interface update.

137
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:32,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's enough Crazy Climber.

138
00:10:33,457 --> 00:10:34,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So crazy.

139
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:35,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God.

140
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,160
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

141
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,623
[SPEAKER_03]: There's rumor floating around, this is all purely speculation, honestly, I don't think there's much...

142
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:51,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Actual fact in this, that Animal Crossing will be going the way of the MMO.

143
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:55,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it will happen anytime soon.

144
00:10:55,367 --> 00:11:03,709
[SPEAKER_03]: If it does, and it's really all based off of Eguchi saying that they wanted to expand the connectivity to mobile phones and computers.

145
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:08,289
[SPEAKER_07]: All Chinese fruit sellers, you know, shaking my tree, stealing my fruit.

146
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:09,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

147
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's so...

148
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:15,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even see how you can grasp that straw.

149
00:11:16,377 --> 00:11:16,557
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

150
00:11:17,858 --> 00:11:19,839
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's going to happen, it'll be much further down.

151
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:23,321
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I could kind of see something like this happening for some reason.

152
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:31,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it just seems like a very logical, and maybe that's why this is grabbing all this steam around the internet and is catching a lot of, you know, whatever.

153
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:34,288
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been saying it for years, though.

154
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,130
[SPEAKER_08]: and it would make sense.

155
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, God, it would totally change the game too because on the DS it kind of felt like a little bit like we've all played before.

156
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,414
[SPEAKER_08]: It felt forced.

157
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:49,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, to be honest, I don't think they're going to do this because that would mean that Nintendo's actually getting with it and we know that's not the case.

158
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,902
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be opening themselves up to a lot of trouble and you know that Nintendo plays it safe.

159
00:11:54,663 --> 00:12:02,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo will decide, hey, you know what, let's run an Animal Crossing BBS and then they'll go from there and then eventually you'll have like your

160
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Animal Crossing chat room and your Animal Crossing game.

161
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:08,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

162
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:11,184
[SPEAKER_08]: My gut tells me something like this is definitely possible.

163
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this could happen.

164
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:13,686
[SPEAKER_08]: But we'll see.

165
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:15,086
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll happen, all right.

166
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:16,667
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2010.

167
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:18,668
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

168
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:19,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Or never.

169
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:21,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of afraid of it happening.

170
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,412
[SPEAKER_08]: If it is an MMO, I'm going to come to Jamie's Village all the time and shake her trees.

171
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:28,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Who says I'll play it?

172
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, snap.

173
00:12:30,638 --> 00:12:33,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I... You know, if it went the route of MMO, I don't think I'd play it.

174
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,621
[SPEAKER_08]: What if it was free?

175
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:38,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a Guild Wars-style thing, where once you buy the game, you can play it however much you want.

176
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,105
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody gives me the game, sure.

177
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:40,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

178
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:43,568
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not the Animal Crossing addict you used to be.

179
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,428
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really.

180
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:48,491
[SPEAKER_03]: It just got really boring for me, and I'm already playing a good MMO right now.

181
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, we'll see what happens.

182
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:55,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, interesting rumor that got leaked out this week is that there was a new character...

183
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming to Smash Bros.

184
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:34,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Crystal, the girl fox who's also in scantily clad blue... Yeah.

185
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:40,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, you know, if you told me last week that King Dedede was going to be a character in the game, I would have said, yeah, right.

186
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:42,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And then look what happened.

187
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:43,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

188
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,857
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, that's too much Kirby in one game, I think.

189
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:53,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know Kirby's great and all, but seriously, three characters, two of them a bit obscure, King Dedede and Meta Knight...

190
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:54,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

191
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:55,706
[SPEAKER_08]: King Dedede's not obscure.

192
00:13:55,906 --> 00:13:59,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, he's not obscure, but... Mr. Play and Watch, I mean... What about Kirby?

193
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:00,387
[SPEAKER_08]: What about that?

194
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:02,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Play and Watch was great.

195
00:14:02,248 --> 00:14:03,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Game and Watch, I'm sorry.

196
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:04,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Game and Watch was great.

197
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:06,089
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a good unlocked character.

198
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:07,950
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of a throwback to Nintendo's history.

199
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:14,612
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just don't... I honestly think if they... I think King Dedede's a good addition and all, but I think they should have just done away with Meta Knight in that case.

200
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:16,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, who's a Meta Knight fan?

201
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:18,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe when the game comes out.

202
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:20,961
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of people now, but I don't know who the fucking King Dedede is.

203
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:24,784
[SPEAKER_07]: All that reminds me of is fucking Carlos Mencia.

204
00:14:24,804 --> 00:14:25,925
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

205
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,767
[SPEAKER_08]: TigerClaw has a really good point in our chatroom.

206
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:31,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLandsRadio.com Keep in mind the creator of Smash Bros.

207
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Brawl also created Kirby.

208
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:34,873
[SPEAKER_08]: So, damn good point.

209
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:39,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he's also created... You need to have Lolo and Lala.

210
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:40,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish.

211
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:40,778
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be awesome.

212
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:45,682
[SPEAKER_08]: He's also created this, which for the Nintendo Wii is something a little bit unheard of, which is getting people very excited.

213
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:48,781
[SPEAKER_08]: and, of course, there's another Target Smash mode yet again.

214
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,842
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we see this often in the Smash Bros.

215
00:14:50,882 --> 00:14:51,082
[SPEAKER_08]: game.

216
00:14:51,842 --> 00:15:03,104
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be a new Target Smash mode in the game, but what's very cool about it is that you can actually send your replays through Target Smash mode to other people on your Wii console friends list.

217
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:04,464
[SPEAKER_08]: They even show pictures of it happening.

218
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:09,205
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of us are like, oh my gosh, we don't see a whole lot of this Wii Connect 24 thing going on right now.

219
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:14,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you have that one random Elebits thing and a couple other, but you don't see a whole lot of this, like, send game stuff

220
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:15,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Two Friends.

221
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:19,178
[SPEAKER_08]: So, very cool that this looks like it's going to be happening.

222
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:22,700
[SPEAKER_08]: A real quick quote from the article, quote, this time you can view replays.

223
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,703
[SPEAKER_08]: What this means is the game records what you did in Brawls or in Target Smash and lets you review it.

224
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:29,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can record up to three minutes of data.

225
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:34,707
[SPEAKER_08]: So not just in the Target mode, it looks like you can actually do this in the actual Brawls.

226
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:36,047
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be fun.

227
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:39,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the next thing is we need to be able to post them to the internet.

228
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:41,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Download them there, kind of like Halo 3.

229
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:45,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine some of the brawl matches we'd see on the site ready to download.

230
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:46,443
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be kind of fun.

231
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:47,384
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

232
00:15:47,584 --> 00:15:52,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll tell you what is very happy for me is a zombie game on the DS.

233
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:53,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I love zombies.

234
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Zombies are pretty awesome.

235
00:15:55,512 --> 00:16:04,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Ignition is releasing a game called Teenage Zombies Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies, which is the best name ever.

236
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:05,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a teenage zombie.

237
00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:09,434
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies.

238
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:21,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically the world is taken over by aliens called, or alien or something called the Big Brain and the Army of Brain Thingies.

239
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these zombies rise from their grave.

240
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:26,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Rise from your grave.

241
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:29,608
[SPEAKER_03]: They're immune to the Brain Thingy Ray and start eating people.

242
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:31,810
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

243
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,151
[SPEAKER_08]: What exactly do you do in the game?

244
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:38,577
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a bunch of stylus minigames and boss battles and puzzles.

245
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:41,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, minigames and puzzles, just what the DS needed.

246
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,524
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's zombies, and it's supposed to play out sort of comic book style.

247
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:47,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that might be kind of cool.

248
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:51,209
[SPEAKER_03]: But it has the word thingy in it, and that's great.

249
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe instead of Mario Party, we need Zombie Party.

250
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:54,873
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be kind of fun.

251
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:55,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Zombie Mario Party.

252
00:16:56,194 --> 00:16:57,195
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Romero Party.

253
00:16:58,675 --> 00:17:05,138
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm going to stop you right there with the whole zombie teenager thing.

254
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:08,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Ignition, what games have they put out?

255
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

256
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,561
[SPEAKER_07]: What, you mean they can't judge a game based on its title alone?

257
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:14,541
[SPEAKER_07]: What does this world come to?

258
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:18,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, remember that other game, Monster Madness, how awesome that was?

259
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh wait, I'm sorry, it was not awesome, it was crap.

260
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:24,986
[SPEAKER_03]: We had zombies, you know what, we need a remake of Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

261
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:28,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew somehow we could not get through a zombie stories without that game coming up.

262
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:29,656
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.

263
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:33,678
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what Monster Madness was sort of trying to be, but it sure as hell was not.

264
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:35,139
[SPEAKER_03]: It failed with a PH.

265
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so moving on.

266
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:41,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Some interesting stuff.

267
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:49,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, not a huge surprise, but, you know, there's going to be yet another Castlevania game on the DS.

268
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:50,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Woo!

269
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Big surprise there.

270
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,172
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, producer Koji...

271
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Igarashi said, the first thing we're doing is another DS version.

272
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:05,475
[SPEAKER_07]: There hasn't been an official announcement, but we're doing it.

273
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,356
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be the official announcement.

274
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:09,418
[SPEAKER_07]: That was in an interview with Game Life.

275
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,142
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be doing a new DS version.

276
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:19,504
[SPEAKER_08]: More Castlevania?

277
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:21,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Or what do they call that?

278
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:21,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Metroidvania?

279
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:22,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Metroidvania.

280
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:24,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Metroidvania

281
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:55,384
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it might be interesting.

282
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you imagine Castlevania and the Metroid Prime 3 engine?

283
00:18:59,167 --> 00:18:59,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Could be interesting.

284
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:03,110
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fairly cool.

285
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know yet.

286
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:04,812
[SPEAKER_08]: It's iffy.

287
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:06,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, it's a very iffy thing.

288
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:08,535
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very iffy thing.

289
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:14,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, last segment we were talking about Spore, and of course a lot of folks are very excited about Spore and Will Wright.

290
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:14,897
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he's the man.

291
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,199
[SPEAKER_08]: But Will Wright made a pretty bold statement this week.

292
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:20,661
[SPEAKER_08]: He said that the Wii is the only next-gen console.

293
00:19:21,381 --> 00:19:26,745
[SPEAKER_08]: He said in an interview, quote, Somebody asked me what I thought next-generation meant, and what about the PlayStation 3 was next-generation.

294
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:29,106
[SPEAKER_08]: The only next-gen system I've seen is the Wii.

295
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:36,611
[SPEAKER_08]: The PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 feel like better versions of the last, but pretty much the same game with incremental improvement.

296
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:38,713
[SPEAKER_08]: That was in an interview with Guardian Unlimited.

297
00:19:39,453 --> 00:20:06,413
[SPEAKER_08]: uh goes on to say quote not that the graphics are more powerful but that it hits a completely different demographic in regards to how the Wii feels like a major jump so coming from one of the you know a major you know gaming mind pretty bold statement there and just kind of goes yeah it's kind of interesting because a lot of people call Wii and you know Nintendo themselves call this the new generation like the Wii's going off over here in this direction whereas Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are kind of doing a little bit more of the same but prettier

298
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:16,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up, you people don't know anything.

299
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,091
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I have to say about that.

300
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:20,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Make your damn games and be quiet.

301
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:23,396
[SPEAKER_07]: This is next generation.

302
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:25,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, they're all fucking new consoles.

303
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:26,819
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all next generation.

304
00:20:26,979 --> 00:20:27,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut the hell up.

305
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:38,091
[SPEAKER_07]: If I made a new 16-bit console, that would still be another generation console because it has come out in this generation of consoles.

306
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:38,631
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

307
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:39,812
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no next-gen.

308
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:40,633
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only current.

309
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Next-gen is stuff that doesn't exist yet.

310
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like that you just told Will Wright to shut up.

311
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,842
[SPEAKER_07]: 7th Generation of Consoles

312
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:14,371
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Wikipedia puts the Atari 2600 in the second generation of games with, I believe, like Coleco and some of the ones before it in the first generation.

313
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:19,055
[SPEAKER_03]: So then the first generation would then be like the Odyssey and the Fairchild Channel 11?

314
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:19,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh boy, here we go.

315
00:21:19,935 --> 00:21:20,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, here we go.

316
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:22,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I will pull up the article right now.

317
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:25,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I just think that this whole classification is pretty retarded.

318
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,624
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just tired of people commenting on what systems they think are next-gen and which systems are not.

319
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,146
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all fucking... whatever.

320
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:34,307
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

321
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:35,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Your comment makes...

322
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:41,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't own a PS3, so you don't use your 360, I don't care.

323
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Make your damn game.

324
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:43,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop chit-chatting.

325
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:45,034
[SPEAKER_07]: More workie on Spore.

326
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:49,538
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

327
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:50,359
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

328
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually bringing this up right now.

329
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:57,325
[SPEAKER_08]: They split this out into the different generations here.

330
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:01,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if I can grab the wrap-up here real quick.

331
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,331
[SPEAKER_08]: with the generations.

332
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:07,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk more rock.

333
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:08,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

334
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:21,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah, the first generation of games would be from 72 to 77 and includes the Magnavox Odyssey, Pong, and the Coleco Telstar are the games in the first generation.

335
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the second generation moves on to...

336
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:45,591
[SPEAKER_08]: The Fairchild Channel F, RCA Studio 2, Atari 2600, Valley Astrocade, The Odyssey, The APF Imagination Machine, The Intellivision, The Atari 5200, Milton Bradley Vectrex, The Immersion Arcadia 2001, ColecoVision, and the Sega SG-1000 are all considered in the second generation.

337
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:46,992
[SPEAKER_03]: The Fairchild Channel F was ass.

338
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:58,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the video game crash of 1983 separates to the third generation, which is the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Sega Master System, and the Atari 7800.

339
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:02,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we get into the fourth generation of console games.

340
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:14,979
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fourth generation of console games includes TurboGrafx-16, the Sega Genesis, the Neo Geo, and the Super Nintendo.

341
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:21,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Speculate!

342
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:22,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, how about some other stuff?

343
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:23,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure!

344
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:25,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Poppin' Music B-Mouse!

345
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,174
[SPEAKER_03]: The new Poppin' Music to be coming out.

346
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:34,737
[SPEAKER_03]: It's themed after computer mice, so it's B-Mouse.

347
00:23:35,157 --> 00:23:36,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a computer mouse.

348
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, and it is an actual mouse?

349
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:41,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is an actual mouse.

350
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:43,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a look at the picture.

351
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:44,098
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

352
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:47,759
[SPEAKER_07]: It basically folds open and there's buttons underneath it.

353
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,300
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bizarre.

354
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,520
[SPEAKER_07]: You really need to check it out.

355
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:59,962
[SPEAKER_03]: You can open up the mouse for nine buttons and play a pop-up music simulator with a CD.

356
00:24:01,342 --> 00:24:02,042
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.

357
00:24:02,582 --> 00:24:03,462
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very interesting.

358
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:05,643
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got the list of songs.

359
00:24:07,243 --> 00:24:08,483
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a really cool picture of it.

360
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:09,684
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on Konami Style.

361
00:24:10,504 --> 00:24:11,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely worth checking out.

362
00:24:12,796 --> 00:24:13,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything worth noting?

363
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:15,599
[SPEAKER_07]: On the song list, I mean.

364
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:17,500
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually some pretty cool stuff.

365
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,405
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Mr. T, Gradius Full Speed is on there.

366
00:24:22,885 --> 00:24:26,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Daikinkai by Desiro Gumi.

367
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:30,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Another Lament theme song.

368
00:24:30,996 --> 00:24:51,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Shizuku Bayasaki, we have Megane Rock, Pop Music Wan, Gira Gira Megane Dan, Showa Kayo, Ringo, I can't see the text, it's so small, Hachimitsu, Anettai Majisuka, Orchestra Featuring Maki, yeah, that's what it says.

369
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:53,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of stuff.

370
00:24:53,342 --> 00:24:55,663
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Shining by Ryo and Noria.

371
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:57,383
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think

372
00:24:57,893 --> 00:24:59,833
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this actually is a mouse.

373
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:01,914
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually use it on your computer.

374
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:08,255
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you take a look at this wonderful picture here, Rob, this is what it looks like.

375
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:10,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, good, because I was actually bringing it up right now.

376
00:25:10,215 --> 00:25:11,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that is weird.

377
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:13,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh.

378
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:14,356
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of cool, though, I guess.

379
00:25:14,636 --> 00:25:14,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

380
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:20,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So gaming, it's a mouse, and then when you're, you know, ready to game, you can do it.

381
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:22,998
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

382
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:24,098
[SPEAKER_03]: That's totally...

383
00:25:25,754 --> 00:25:28,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm putting the link in the chat room so they can see what it looks like.

384
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:30,695
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the 2DX mouse.

385
00:25:32,015 --> 00:25:33,235
[SPEAKER_03]: 2DX mouse would not work.

386
00:25:33,776 --> 00:25:36,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially for, you know, people like me who are right side players.

387
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:37,696
[SPEAKER_07]: But you could do it though.

388
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:42,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you think about it, you could have like a scroll wheel on the side of the mouse that would be the scratch.

389
00:25:43,938 --> 00:25:44,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

390
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:45,078
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of weird.

391
00:25:45,098 --> 00:25:48,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what they did for the... Or hell, just play 2DX with this.

392
00:25:48,999 --> 00:25:49,799
[SPEAKER_03]: For the WonderSwan?

393
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,259
[SPEAKER_03]: For Beat Mania on WonderSwan?

394
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:59,412
[SPEAKER_03]: They had an add-on to it that you could attach a scratch pad onto the controller.

395
00:25:59,632 --> 00:26:01,153
[SPEAKER_07]: We should get 2DXDS.

396
00:26:02,534 --> 00:26:03,214
[SPEAKER_03]: That would work.

397
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:05,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that would work.

398
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:07,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I stand by what I said in Part A about what they really need to do to innovate.

399
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:12,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so other fun stuff, of course.

400
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,045
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more firmware coming out now for the PlayStation 3.

401
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:26,469
[SPEAKER_07]: If you happen to purchase a copy of Ratchet & Clank Future, Tools of Destruction, you got version 1.94, which didn't really do much.

402
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:31,871
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it added some support for the DualShock 3 for that game, and then maybe some other shit.

403
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:41,156
[SPEAKER_07]: But that doesn't matter, because apparently firmware 2.0 is supposed to be released on October 30th, and will feature some wonderful stuff, including...

404
00:26:42,913 --> 00:26:49,919
[SPEAKER_07]: The ability to turn on and off your PS3 using the PSP Remote Play.

405
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,581
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see the purpose of that.

406
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:56,164
[SPEAKER_07]: A new PlayStation Network category.

407
00:26:56,544 --> 00:27:04,530
[SPEAKER_07]: A TV category for those of you who are in Europe who are installing the Play TV onto your hard drive.

408
00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:07,673
[SPEAKER_07]: A new playlist for music and photo.

409
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,496
[SPEAKER_07]: A content group for video and game.

410
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:32,868
[SPEAKER_07]: and apparently there's the cross media bar customization including themes and background color settings sort of like what they have with the PSP right now and then the Trend Micro Web Security for PS3 Internet Browser which is a parental lock for website viewing that will be free for a while and then eventually they'll charge you for it.

411
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:39,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Well Ratchet and Clank also has something else very interesting in it not just a surprise upgrade

412
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:41,330
[SPEAKER_08]: in anticipation of 2.0.

413
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:49,995
[SPEAKER_08]: But Ratchet & Clank Future Tools of Destruction apparently will actually tie up to the upcoming PSP game Secret Agent Clank.

414
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:55,278
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was from a one-up interview with Insomniac's creative director, Brian Alagier.

415
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:06,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently he says that the PS3 game and the new PSP game will actually work and connect to each other in, quote, some secret, undisclosed way.

416
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:07,886
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's all we know.

417
00:28:08,842 --> 00:28:12,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you unlock some old Ratchet & Clank game with it?

418
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:13,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a Metroid hookup type thing?

419
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, we don't know.

420
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:18,630
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do know that the game will not connect up with other services.

421
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:24,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Tools of Destruction will not connect to Home or any other PlayStation game or PSP game.

422
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:27,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the other Ratchet & Clank game that is coming out.

423
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:28,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Secret Agent Clank.

424
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:29,800
[SPEAKER_08]: So, look for it.

425
00:28:31,321 --> 00:28:33,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be curious to know what that connectivity is.

426
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,745
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it's something new and exciting.

427
00:28:35,785 --> 00:28:37,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Not something we've kind of seen before.

428
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:47,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for anyone who is playing Motorstorm, there is a, looks like a patch to the game.

429
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

430
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:55,853
[SPEAKER_03]: that will actually add vibration support for the DualShock 3 controller.

431
00:28:57,473 --> 00:29:01,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Grid order randomized for the first race in any online lobby.

432
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:08,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Finishing positions for your last race to determine your starting grid position in the next race within the same online lobby.

433
00:29:09,518 --> 00:29:14,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Screen indicators added to show whether voice comms are issuing from TV or headset.

434
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:18,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Sensitivity for 6-axis motion sensor

435
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Gloating Index, that's kind of weird.

436
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:28,540
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives you an idea of how well another racer has performed.

437
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:34,409
[SPEAKER_08]: I do like how it seems like quite a few Sony games are doing this.

438
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:37,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how these games kind of keep patching themselves to get a little better.

439
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:40,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's kind of cool.

440
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:44,117
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels like I'm seeing that happen more on the Sony games than on 360 games.

441
00:29:44,197 --> 00:29:49,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually the 360 games get patched to fix something that broke, not often to add completely new stuff.

442
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:56,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And that makes it feel a little more like, well, let's say World of Warcraft constantly patches itself, and a lot of MMOs do this, patch itself with brand new stuff.

443
00:29:57,486 --> 00:29:58,447
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of interesting.

444
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,081
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

445
00:30:20,925 --> 00:30:23,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it kind of sucked when everybody was hitting it at once.

446
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,546
[SPEAKER_08]: But World of Warcraft does it kind of smart now.

447
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:34,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Right before a major patch will come out, a couple days or maybe even a week before, they'll actually put a thing similar to BitTorrent that will automatically run when you launch WoW.

448
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:37,270
[SPEAKER_08]: So it slowly downloads the patch as you're playing.

449
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:43,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that way when it's time for the patch to go live, then it'll send a pulse that says, okay, time to update the game with the patch.

450
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,053
[SPEAKER_08]: And so everybody already has it downloaded.

451
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:46,253
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of cool.

452
00:30:46,753 --> 00:30:47,393
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty smart.

453
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:49,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the way they do it on WoW.

454
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want 2.3 already, because I want my Arena Season 1 gear without having to work for it.

455
00:30:55,212 --> 00:31:01,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I still kind of like how they do it in Ragnarok, where they do small patches every time.

456
00:31:02,836 --> 00:31:05,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it makes sure that your patches are all up to date right when you start the game.

457
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:13,260
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of how Guild Wars worked too, wasn't it?

458
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so, it's just little bits at a time.

459
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:17,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, cool.

460
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:23,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, let's see here.

461
00:31:25,054 --> 00:31:26,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting news.

462
00:31:26,295 --> 00:31:34,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I wouldn't exactly call this news because I've been talking about how stupid easy it's going to be to copy the damn cards for Eye of Judgment.

463
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,321
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently it's even easier than you may have thought.

464
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,504
[SPEAKER_07]: The game has absolutely no copy protection whatsoever.

465
00:31:41,904 --> 00:31:48,228
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, you can pretty much draw symbols on a piece of paper using a felt tip marker and it will work.

466
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:51,513
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really sad.

467
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:54,454
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's very easy to copy them.

468
00:31:56,075 --> 00:32:07,198
[SPEAKER_07]: The game has no problem reading, you know, printed out copies of the cards, or just if you happen to scribble in the symbols that they have on the cards, it will work as well.

469
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:10,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically with a box of Crayolas, I could recreate the cards.

470
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:11,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

471
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:11,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

472
00:32:11,979 --> 00:32:12,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you could.

473
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,180
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of sad.

474
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:15,920
[SPEAKER_08]: It is sad.

475
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:17,301
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

476
00:32:17,441 --> 00:32:17,941
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't...

477
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:21,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just curious what the chat room has to say for this.

478
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will remind... I'm having live stream problems.

479
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Tetsuya is giving a big XD to Crayola.

480
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:37,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I will remind you, though, that in case you don't want to copy the cards, the theme packs are available for $15 each or $4 per booster pack.

481
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:40,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear I didn't use a crayon reference on purpose.

482
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:41,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear.

483
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:41,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

484
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:42,935
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

485
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:44,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, what's that?

486
00:32:44,436 --> 00:32:45,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the fake cards?

487
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:46,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

488
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:52,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, you know, this means we got lied to about the whole copy protection thing, and I don't like getting lied to.

489
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:57,192
[SPEAKER_08]: We all knew this was coming, we all knew this was going to happen, and this makes us very angsty.

490
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,253
[SPEAKER_08]: So you know we have to bring on the FUs of the week.

491
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:02,954
[SPEAKER_08]: And back by popular demand, folks.

492
00:33:13,637 --> 00:33:15,497
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to this music, I'm fucking sick of it.

493
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:19,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, we got emails.

494
00:33:19,418 --> 00:33:19,998
[SPEAKER_08]: They missed it.

495
00:33:20,318 --> 00:33:20,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't care.

496
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:21,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't care.

497
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't care.

498
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:24,059
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

499
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,300
[SPEAKER_07]: F you the women for not being able to make up their mind on certain things.

500
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:36,062
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, say you're asking your wife what they want to eat for dinner.

501
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, I don't know.

502
00:33:37,742 --> 00:33:38,942
[SPEAKER_07]: So you start suggesting things.

503
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:40,203
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, no, I don't want to do that.

504
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:41,043
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't want to do that.

505
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:48,239
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll fucking suggest something then if you're just going to deny every one of my suggestions and fucking come up with your own.

506
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:48,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it.

507
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,121
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not about everything.

508
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:52,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Women do this about all sorts of categories.

509
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:54,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give you a hint.

510
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:56,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do whatever you want.

511
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:59,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, and they complain.

512
00:33:59,827 --> 00:34:03,029
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there's no winning that argument.

513
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:05,931
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

514
00:34:07,892 --> 00:34:11,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, my FU of the week goes to my injury.

515
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it sucks.

516
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,443
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't like having a sore thigh thing.

517
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:18,724
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes it hard to sit down.

518
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:20,785
[SPEAKER_08]: People go, ha ha ha, you can't sit down.

519
00:34:21,986 --> 00:34:22,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Being injured sucks.

520
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a real FU, actually.

521
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:26,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yes, what is that?

522
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid music pushed it out of my head.

523
00:34:30,753 --> 00:34:32,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know if I have the other music queued up.

524
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:33,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

525
00:34:33,976 --> 00:34:39,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if we can do... Shuffling, shuffling, shuffling.

526
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:42,176
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Wonderful Radio as I dig through the computer.

527
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:42,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry about it.

528
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:43,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, hold on.

529
00:34:43,657 --> 00:34:44,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

530
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:45,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in the right folder.

531
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I just need the right file name.

532
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:49,942
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we go.

533
00:34:51,904 --> 00:34:52,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better.

534
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:52,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

535
00:34:57,188 --> 00:34:57,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

536
00:35:06,868 --> 00:35:08,088
[SPEAKER_03]: My actual F.U.

537
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:13,152
[SPEAKER_03]: goes towards... I don't really want to say towards my husband.

538
00:35:13,872 --> 00:35:18,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I really, really, really do love my husband.

539
00:35:19,696 --> 00:35:22,537
[SPEAKER_03]: But he can be freaking infuriating sometimes.

540
00:35:23,518 --> 00:35:27,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that he has good intentions.

541
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:32,023
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't try to...

542
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:41,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't try to have a logical discussion with me when I haven't eaten anything in like 12 hours.

543
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,130
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work.

544
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:44,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't be pushy about it either.

545
00:35:45,934 --> 00:35:46,334
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

546
00:35:50,698 --> 00:35:51,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

547
00:35:51,939 --> 00:35:54,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was putting away the webcam because our Op 11 time ran up.

548
00:35:55,101 --> 00:35:56,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are people pushy?

549
00:35:57,443 --> 00:35:57,784
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

550
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:01,287
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't be pushy, you should be pully.

551
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:09,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's get back into some gaming news, because then we'll be pushing the listeners to call in on our Skype line.

552
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:12,121
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lingerie.

553
00:36:12,141 --> 00:36:14,543
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a few more stories, a handful of stories for you guys before we get there.

554
00:36:15,264 --> 00:36:17,265
[SPEAKER_08]: And the first one has to do with GameStop.

555
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:23,490
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, GameStop, they have EB, and it seems like they're taking over the world when it comes to mall video game stores.

556
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And they just might be, because they just opened up.

557
00:36:26,573 --> 00:36:28,174
[SPEAKER_08]: This place isn't that far from us, actually.

558
00:36:28,214 --> 00:36:29,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Jackson, California.

559
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:30,376
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not that far from here.

560
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:31,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Just probably...

561
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:37,191
[SPEAKER_08]: They opened up their 5,000th store, GameStop did.

562
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:39,332
[SPEAKER_08]: The 5,000th GameStop store.

563
00:36:39,352 --> 00:36:39,993
[SPEAKER_08]: What GameStop?

564
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:46,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, to put that in perspective, and a lot of people feel that way, which is why this news may be good news for some and bad news for others.

565
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:54,700
[SPEAKER_08]: To put it in perspective, Starbucks has 12,000 plus locations, but I wonder if that counts like the ones in the grocery store.

566
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

567
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:58,858
[SPEAKER_08]: and McDonald's, get this, has 31,000 restaurants.

568
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:05,482
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, to think that for every six McDonald's there's one GameStop, I mean, there's a lot of frickin' McDonald's, right?

569
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, every exit on the freeway has a McDonald's, right?

570
00:37:08,023 --> 00:37:11,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So, kind of interesting that for every six of those there's still one GameStop.

571
00:37:12,385 --> 00:37:12,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

572
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting.

573
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:22,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what else is interesting is that people are still making Dreamcast games.

574
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rest of the world goes, why?

575
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:26,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Dreamcast was so awesome.

576
00:37:56,784 --> 00:38:00,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, it's a little bit of fun here.

577
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:09,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't know if this is fun, but the place where the internet goes to die is now going to be the place where games go to die.

578
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:13,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Because MySpace is launching their Casual Games channel in 2008.

579
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:20,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll be able to put crappy Flash games into your webpage.

580
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,168
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can destroy my profile with all those buildings.

581
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:25,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people do that already.

582
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:27,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I think people on MySpace have seen it.

583
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:30,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Some coworker of mine has Pac-Man on their profile.

584
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:32,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a little mini Pac-Man game.

585
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,610
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not real Pac-Man.

586
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,931
[SPEAKER_08]: It's some cheap knockoff, but oh boy.

587
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:43,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Could that be interesting though if they had leaderboards all tied together and you could see how you compare on these casual games to your friends?

588
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, a little silly fun.

589
00:38:45,899 --> 00:38:46,440
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

590
00:39:01,095 --> 00:39:03,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I had somebody make mine.

591
00:39:03,516 --> 00:39:04,716
[SPEAKER_08]: But mine was pretty.

592
00:39:04,896 --> 00:39:07,377
[SPEAKER_08]: You still had the final approval and you looked at it and you go, yeah.

593
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:10,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I helped design the graphics on it too.

594
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:14,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I look at some of my friends' MySpaces and I go, do you even look at your own page?

595
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:15,720
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hideous.

596
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,100
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to scroll down forever to see anything.

597
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:19,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's actually going to look at this?

598
00:39:21,081 --> 00:39:23,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually scaled my MySpace page back a little while ago.

599
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:31,624
[SPEAKER_08]: A, so I can make it public, and B, because it's public again, and B, so I could just not have to scroll so much because of all the stupid pictures I had on it.

600
00:39:34,244 --> 00:39:38,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Black Lab in our chatroom says, MySpace is garbage, but don't you have a MySpace?

601
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:42,606
[SPEAKER_08]: GS68 says, you do not say the MS word.

602
00:39:42,706 --> 00:39:43,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft?

603
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:45,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, MySpace.

604
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:46,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone left a comment.

605
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:49,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just checking my MySpace now to see what was on it.

606
00:39:50,328 --> 00:39:52,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neki left the best joke ever.

607
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:52,689
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

608
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:55,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do mentally ill people go that's bigger on the inside than the out?

609
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's their retardus.

610
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:59,352
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awful.

611
00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:00,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, a tardus.

612
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:01,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.

613
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:02,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

614
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:04,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad Doctor Who joke.

615
00:40:04,074 --> 00:40:06,034
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a very bad joke in many different forms.

616
00:40:06,095 --> 00:40:06,975
[SPEAKER_08]: But it made me laugh.

617
00:40:06,995 --> 00:40:07,255
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

618
00:40:08,027 --> 00:40:10,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, maybe our listeners want to tell some jokes tonight.

619
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:13,290
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take some calls right now.

620
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:17,672

622
00:40:21,313 --> 00:40:23,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Have your mom or your daddy's permission because it's only toll free in the U.S.

623
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:24,115
[SPEAKER_08]: and Canada.

[SPEAKER_08]: Or you can call us on Skype.

625
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:26,456
[SPEAKER_08]: That's free for everyone.

626
00:40:26,476 --> 00:40:28,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Our username is OrangeloungeRadio.

627
00:40:30,438 --> 00:40:33,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking at some other quick comments on chat while we wait for some calls because of the delay.

628
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Escapist in our chatroom says, In regards to Facebook...

629
00:40:37,745 --> 00:40:40,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go again with the MySpace versus Facebook thing.

630
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:43,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Just try to lick me in real life, I dare you.

631
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:49,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure that's from one of those, you just got a lick, or you just got poked by so-and-so.

632
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to go back to my annoyance with Facebook.

633
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:59,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually tried to, I went back and added some friends, because some OLR people added me on Facebook.

634
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:03,677
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess amongst all my rants on the show recently, folks figured out I had an account, so.

635
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:08,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's head on over to the phones and we'll take a call.

636
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

637
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:10,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

638
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:13,053
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Legend of Zaku.

639
00:41:13,313 --> 00:41:14,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Legend of Zaku.

640
00:41:14,454 --> 00:41:14,995
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

641
00:41:16,055 --> 00:41:18,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, just going through the usual Sunday 15.

642
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:24,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, getting prices and stuff like that.

643
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:25,542
Demo.

644
00:41:26,163 --> 00:41:26,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Listening to our show.

645
00:41:27,204 --> 00:41:28,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you doing both at the same time?

646
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:32,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I could, now that I have a new PC to do it on.

647
00:41:32,608 --> 00:41:32,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

648
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:34,216
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's on your mind?

649
00:41:34,256 --> 00:41:35,697
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you want to tell us about?

650
00:41:37,097 --> 00:41:37,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

651
00:41:37,757 --> 00:41:43,819
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that Crysis is just, you know, it's not for the faint of heart, graphics-wise and, you know, system-wise.

652
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:48,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you're going to need a really beefy PC to get through it.

653
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,620
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it a good game?

654
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:53,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

655
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:54,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a good game?

656
00:41:55,081 --> 00:41:55,801
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, it is.

657
00:41:55,882 --> 00:42:00,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's kind of like Half-Life and Far... Half-Life 2 and Far Cry had a love child.

658
00:42:01,303 --> 00:42:01,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

659
00:42:02,739 --> 00:42:10,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I mean, yeah, so far it's running pretty good for a new system that I built so far.

660
00:42:11,783 --> 00:42:17,585
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, hopefully when it launches it'll probably be optimized and ready for use.

661
00:42:18,306 --> 00:42:23,428
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little laggy from what I hear from other folks with other more powerful systems than mine.

662
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:26,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, very cool.

663
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:28,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anything else you've been playing lately besides Crysis?

664
00:42:29,951 --> 00:42:30,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just...

665
00:42:31,038 --> 00:42:33,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Quake Wars, another game that came with my video card.

666
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Enemy Territory, Quake Wars.

667
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:36,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And how's that?

668
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:41,863
[SPEAKER_01]: It's alright, I mean, it's kind of like Battlefield in the Quake Wars world.

669
00:42:42,544 --> 00:42:43,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the Quake world.

670
00:42:44,705 --> 00:42:52,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Quake, you know, Quake needs, you know, because Quake 4 wasn't all that great, so Quake needs some good games that make me remember how much the first game was awesome.

671
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:55,470
[SPEAKER_07]: We need Duke, Enemy Territory, Duke Nukem.

672
00:42:56,371 --> 00:42:57,131
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we need.

673
00:42:57,271 --> 00:42:58,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe after Duke Nukem Forever.

674
00:42:59,252 --> 00:43:00,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that supposed to come out at the end of the year?

675
00:43:01,728 --> 00:43:02,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, fucking hell.

676
00:43:02,469 --> 00:43:06,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't one of those, hey, it finally got a release date, and it's like... No, it never got a release date.

677
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:07,712
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be all over the internet, man.

678
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:08,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's true.

679
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:28,265
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I think I heard of another Xbox Live horror story where this one guy, he sent his console to get it repaired, and then when he got the new one back, he couldn't even transfer $320 worth of Microsoft points.

680
00:43:31,152 --> 00:43:32,212
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're not transferable.

681
00:43:33,033 --> 00:43:33,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

682
00:43:34,033 --> 00:43:35,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't you call Microsoft and get that fixed?

683
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:40,536
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's apparently, unfortunately, that's a policy that they have.

684
00:43:40,816 --> 00:43:41,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

685
00:43:41,737 --> 00:43:46,719
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to transfer the points because your live account is on their server.

686
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:47,699
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not on the 360.

687
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:54,322
[SPEAKER_01]: All you've got to do is re... What they told him was that the points were actually tied to the console.

688
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:55,731
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're not.

689
00:43:56,572 --> 00:43:58,393
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I recall, it's a little bit of both.

690
00:43:58,713 --> 00:44:01,295
[SPEAKER_08]: You download the game, and that's tied to your account, but here's the thing.

691
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:08,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's say me and you, let's say we're roommates again, Loki, back in the day, and we have one 360 in the house.

692
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,083
[SPEAKER_08]: If I paid for the game and I downloaded it, you get to play the full version on the console.

693
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:14,324
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the thing.

694
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:20,628
[SPEAKER_08]: If we get a new console or whatever, and I sign in and download the game, you can't play it.

695
00:44:20,968 --> 00:44:22,349
[SPEAKER_08]: You still get the trial version.

696
00:44:23,459 --> 00:44:26,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's still, that doesn't matter, that's the thing.

697
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:39,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that his games that he purchased should be able to be transferred over because he can just re-download them again and he still has the full rights to them because it has, you know, on record that he's paid for it.

698
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:45,323
[SPEAKER_07]: and also if he has any Microsoft points because you can purchase those points through like independent websites and stuff and add them on there.

699
00:44:45,343 --> 00:44:51,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Like for example, if you're buying stuff for your Zoom, your Microsoft account or whatever, still tied to all that stuff.

700
00:44:51,086 --> 00:44:53,327
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can port it over even if you buy a new 360.

701
00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:57,009
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the ability to do that.

702
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:57,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done that.

703
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the story right now.

704
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where.

705
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I saw it on... Well, that's the story and you stick into it.

706
00:45:04,332 --> 00:45:04,552
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

707
00:45:04,852 --> 00:45:06,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Zach, we got to let you go to get some more calls.

708
00:45:06,713 --> 00:45:07,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quick, last final thought for everybody.

709
00:45:09,177 --> 00:45:17,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just, I don't know, just, you know, just get a better computer.

710
00:45:17,983 --> 00:45:19,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody might need one.

711
00:45:19,544 --> 00:45:20,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody, get a better computer.

712
00:45:21,326 --> 00:45:22,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, thanks, Saku.

713
00:45:22,246 --> 00:45:22,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one, buddy.

714
00:45:23,427 --> 00:45:23,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, good.

715
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:24,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

716
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:25,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you hear that, everybody?

717
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:26,929
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to get a better computer.

718
00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:28,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, get a better computer.

719
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:29,611
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, get a better computer.

720
00:45:29,631 --> 00:45:30,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I do need a better computer.

721
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:31,432
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I need a computer.

722
00:45:32,373 --> 00:45:34,855
[SPEAKER_07]: My computer, the hard drive, or something's crapping out on it.

723
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:35,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually want to...

724
00:45:35,782 --> 00:45:36,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Shutting off.

725
00:45:36,222 --> 00:45:39,345
[SPEAKER_08]: This fucking fan on this thing is so... I wonder if I could, like, hold the microphone.

726
00:45:39,385 --> 00:45:39,906
[SPEAKER_08]: You could hear it.

727
00:45:42,328 --> 00:45:44,109
[SPEAKER_08]: The fan on this thing is so loud.

728
00:45:44,129 --> 00:45:45,350
[SPEAKER_08]: You can hear it throughout the whole house.

729
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,151
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.

730
00:45:46,671 --> 00:45:47,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

731
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:48,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

732
00:45:52,236 --> 00:45:53,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

733
00:45:53,137 --> 00:45:53,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

734
00:45:54,758 --> 00:45:56,399
[SPEAKER_09]: This would be the Dark Knight himself.

735
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,420
[SPEAKER_08]: There you are, sir.

736
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,781
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a little bit quiet, but that's all right.

737
00:45:58,841 --> 00:45:59,742
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll fix that.

738
00:46:00,022 --> 00:46:00,603
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing?

739
00:46:00,823 --> 00:46:01,584
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing, Dark Knight?

740
00:46:03,746 --> 00:46:04,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, how you doing?

741
00:46:05,202 --> 00:46:05,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, how are you?

742
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, a little bit happier now that I have my 360.

743
00:46:11,384 --> 00:46:14,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually, I noticed that you've actually been signing into live.

744
00:46:14,265 --> 00:46:20,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I was playing Guitar Hero 3 earlier today, and I saw you sign on, and I was kind of like, wait a minute, I thought he only had an Xbox.com account, but not a live.

745
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,447
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you're actually on Xbox Live.

746
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:24,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And all that.

747
00:46:25,668 --> 00:46:27,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

748
00:46:28,029 --> 00:46:29,269
[SPEAKER_08]: So what kind of games have you been playing?

749
00:46:30,809 --> 00:46:32,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Forza 2 and, um,

750
00:46:33,689 --> 00:46:36,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Man of 97, Man of 07, I'm sorry.

751
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:39,931
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, if you were playing Man of 97 on Xbox, that would be something though.

752
00:46:39,951 --> 00:46:43,092
[SPEAKER_08]: That means you had to crash the cartridge into some slot.

753
00:46:43,152 --> 00:46:45,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox Live Arcade or something like that.

754
00:46:45,893 --> 00:46:46,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

755
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:51,095
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what's it like being all brand new to the Xbox now?

756
00:46:51,195 --> 00:46:53,976
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, does it seem like there's like a lot out there the Xbox has to offer?

757
00:46:54,176 --> 00:46:56,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess let me back up and rephrase it this way.

758
00:46:56,377 --> 00:46:59,638
[SPEAKER_08]: What made you finally decide to take the plunge after all this time and jump in and get a 360?

759
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:02,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of it because I

760
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:04,009
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

761
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:34,610
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

762
00:47:53,183 --> 00:47:53,443
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

763
00:47:53,483 --> 00:47:57,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Not everybody can just afford to run out and go buy an HD TV.

764
00:47:57,587 --> 00:47:59,348
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still kind of pricey.

765
00:47:59,848 --> 00:48:08,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think, amongst your gaming experience, does Microsoft do a pretty good job of still keeping the love for the folks that are stuck with standard definition for now?

766
00:48:09,676 --> 00:48:12,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, it's not really that bad at all.

767
00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:17,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, I'm playing Mando 7, and it looks just as good on HD.

768
00:48:17,182 --> 00:48:20,125
[SPEAKER_09]: The only difference is I don't have that total clearness, and I...

769
00:48:20,908 --> 00:48:23,770
[SPEAKER_09]: HD would have them, but it does do it justice.

770
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:26,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Do most of the standard definitions of games letterbox?

771
00:48:27,473 --> 00:48:28,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you get the bars?

772
00:48:29,915 --> 00:48:33,677
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because basically it picks up as a 480p TV.

773
00:48:34,438 --> 00:48:35,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, interesting.

774
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Some games letterbox themselves though, right?

775
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:41,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't Final Fantasy XI automatically letterbox even if you were on a standard TV?

776
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it depends on the game.

777
00:48:43,444 --> 00:48:49,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because you have to set your console to just, you can set it so that your TV is a 4x3 aspect ratio and then

778
00:48:50,325 --> 00:48:54,449
[SPEAKER_07]: If the game wants to letterbox it will, otherwise it may just do full screen.

779
00:48:57,551 --> 00:48:59,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

780
00:49:00,194 --> 00:49:00,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

781
00:49:00,814 --> 00:49:01,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said.

782
00:49:03,797 --> 00:49:08,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Dark Knight, what would you say you're looking forward to most on the 360 now that you're an owner?

783
00:49:11,464 --> 00:49:12,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Just messing around with it right now.

784
00:49:13,586 --> 00:49:14,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Just getting used to it.

785
00:49:14,446 --> 00:49:16,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, so far I downloaded some, like...

786
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:25,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox Live games and whatnot, like I downloaded Final Fantasy Special and whatnot.

787
00:49:25,405 --> 00:49:26,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't get my words out tonight.

788
00:49:26,565 --> 00:49:27,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

789
00:49:27,045 --> 00:49:27,566
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's all right.

790
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:32,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So, wow, if you think about it, they're almost up to like 100 of those games pretty soon.

791
00:49:32,168 --> 00:49:40,733
[SPEAKER_08]: So being a new, I mean, for those of us who have been on Xbox Live a while, it seems like, all right, you know, we just kind of wait for each week to see what they're going to release and see if it's worth buying.

792
00:49:40,773 --> 00:49:43,515
[SPEAKER_08]: But, man, to be jumping in on that now and then you dip into the archive, like,

793
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:47,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Dark Knight, we have to let you go so we can get to some more calls.

794
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:49,274
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, and enjoy the Xbox.

795
00:49:49,294 --> 00:49:50,575
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hope your Xbox experience is Red Rings of Death free.

796
00:49:50,595 --> 00:49:52,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, lo and behold, my system is like a link to it.

797
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:13,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was dated July 22nd of 07, so it's recent.

798
00:50:13,293 --> 00:50:13,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, good.

799
00:50:14,114 --> 00:50:14,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

800
00:50:14,374 --> 00:50:15,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I hope it's red rings free.

801
00:50:16,075 --> 00:50:16,315
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

802
00:50:16,335 --> 00:50:17,756
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be pulling for you, buddy.

803
00:50:18,836 --> 00:50:19,196
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

804
00:50:19,236 --> 00:50:19,697
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a good one.

805
00:50:19,877 --> 00:50:20,117
[SPEAKER_08]: See you.

806
00:50:20,137 --> 00:50:20,417
[SPEAKER_08]: You too.

807
00:50:21,378 --> 00:50:21,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

808
00:50:21,658 --> 00:50:21,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

809
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:28,702
[SPEAKER_08]: If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

810
00:50:29,062 --> 00:50:31,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if we can squeeze in some – oh, we're already getting a call.

811
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:31,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

812
00:50:33,044 --> 00:50:34,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

813
00:50:34,045 --> 00:50:34,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

814
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:36,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yo, it's Xenacore.

815
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:36,906
[SPEAKER_05]: How y'all doing?

816
00:50:37,026 --> 00:50:37,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

817
00:50:37,346 --> 00:50:38,167
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you, Xenacore?

818
00:50:39,008 --> 00:50:40,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm living, I'm living.

819
00:50:40,348 --> 00:50:41,269
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how things go.

820
00:50:41,509 --> 00:50:42,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

821
00:50:42,429 --> 00:50:42,809
[SPEAKER_08]: So are we.

822
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:47,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Even with minor injuries and whatever else is going on in our personal lives, we're making it to another week.

823
00:50:48,151 --> 00:50:48,671
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

824
00:50:50,892 --> 00:50:51,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much.

825
00:50:51,813 --> 00:50:55,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I just heard you guys referencing some of the old school stuff and thought I'd call in.

826
00:50:57,435 --> 00:50:59,655
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura was talking about Ragnarok 2.

827
00:51:00,055 --> 00:51:04,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I touched something that looks like it was made in the same engine called, was it

828
00:51:04,946 --> 00:51:06,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Pirate King Online

829
00:51:17,459 --> 00:51:20,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I got that feeling, but I'm going to farm that off on the show.

830
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't review it.

831
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:24,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Xenocore, what is a weird echoing with you?

832
00:51:24,902 --> 00:51:25,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what that is.

833
00:51:26,002 --> 00:51:32,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to let those people who are listening on their iPods and stuff know, if you're hearing him repeat things, that's not you guys.

834
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:34,505
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something weird with the call.

835
00:51:34,785 --> 00:51:35,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it is you guys.

836
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:37,726
[SPEAKER_08]: You just can't hear correctly.

837
00:51:38,406 --> 00:51:39,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what that is.

838
00:51:39,146 --> 00:51:40,307
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an error I've not seen before.

839
00:51:40,547 --> 00:51:42,868
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, so Pirate King was okay.

840
00:51:43,008 --> 00:51:44,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Ragnarok was a ton more fun.

841
00:51:44,928 --> 00:51:45,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, all right.

842
00:51:46,609 --> 00:51:46,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

843
00:51:48,483 --> 00:51:57,990
[SPEAKER_05]: that one and all different odds and ends here and there managed to get some more points on ER Kung Fu and Xbox Live but that's pretty much the only noteworthy thing I've been doing lately so

844
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:00,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Yara Kung Fu is a pretty fun little game.

845
00:52:01,055 --> 00:52:02,476
[SPEAKER_08]: It's often overlooked.

846
00:52:03,437 --> 00:52:06,719
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, because fighting games have evolved so damn much since then.

847
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:08,580
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, you've got to respect the elders, too.

848
00:52:08,981 --> 00:52:10,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you play a lot of RPGs.

849
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:15,465
[SPEAKER_08]: What other kind of obscure MMOs, because everybody always talks about Warcraft, Warcraft, Warcraft.

850
00:52:15,846 --> 00:52:22,951
[SPEAKER_08]: What other types of MMOs and just maybe other role-playing games in general should we be looking out for that maybe the mainstream media doesn't pay enough attention to?

851
00:52:23,956 --> 00:52:25,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Bounty Bay Online Bounty Bay Online

852
00:52:32,535 --> 00:52:33,535
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pirate simulator.

853
00:52:33,595 --> 00:52:37,896
[SPEAKER_05]: It plays like pirates does, but it's an MMO environment, so it was pretty neat.

854
00:52:38,616 --> 00:52:42,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, we really do have a lot of pirates MMOs, because then Disney put out an official one.

855
00:52:42,097 --> 00:52:49,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking, well, of course, there's puzzle pirates too, and it's kind of all probably thanks to Johnny Depp, but I don't know.

856
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:51,340
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd like to think probably he has something to do with that.

857
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,400
[SPEAKER_08]: But where are my ninja MMOs?

858
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,560
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the ultimate question.

859
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,901
[SPEAKER_08]: We have all these pirate MMOs.

860
00:52:56,261 --> 00:53:00,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is my ninja MMO, whether it be Ninja Gaiden or Last Ninja?

861
00:53:00,162 --> 00:53:01,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, just a ninja MMO.

862
00:53:02,452 --> 00:53:03,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

863
00:53:03,332 --> 00:53:04,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn Skippy, man.

864
00:53:05,353 --> 00:53:06,954
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to take our idea and patent it.

865
00:53:07,234 --> 00:53:07,534
[SPEAKER_08]: There it is.

866
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:10,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I now own the patents and trademarks on the Ninja MMO.

867
00:53:11,235 --> 00:53:12,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch me get sued.

868
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:13,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody probably made one.

869
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:14,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know of it.

870
00:53:17,758 --> 00:53:18,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

871
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,239
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much it.

872
00:53:21,779 --> 00:53:24,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still waiting for Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3 to come out.

873
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,081
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see how they do upon release.

874
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:26,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Guitar Hero 3 was out yesterday.

875
00:53:29,784 --> 00:53:30,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, that's true, that's true.

876
00:53:30,944 --> 00:53:35,905
[SPEAKER_05]: But Rock Band's the one I'm looking for, but I'm waiting for the peripherals to start coming by themselves.

877
00:53:35,945 --> 00:53:38,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have that many homies around me to buy the whole set.

878
00:53:38,226 --> 00:53:40,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, that's too much money for the whole set.

879
00:53:40,626 --> 00:53:43,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, the peripherals by themselves are going to be going into 08.

880
00:53:44,507 --> 00:53:48,588
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm probably going to pick up the game because I have the Guitar Hero 2 controller, which will work with Rock Band.

881
00:53:48,888 --> 00:53:54,629
[SPEAKER_08]: So at least I'll have guitar, and if my microphone works for Xbox Live, then I'll have a microphone.

882
00:53:54,669 --> 00:53:56,410
[SPEAKER_08]: If it doesn't, then it doesn't.

883
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:57,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody on Xbox Live needs to hear me sing anyway.

884
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:58,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm buying it.

885
00:53:58,871 --> 00:53:59,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need to hear me sing.

886
00:53:59,851 --> 00:54:00,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm buying.

887
00:54:00,171 --> 00:54:01,191
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to buy the whole bundle?

888
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:01,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

889
00:54:01,832 --> 00:54:02,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Sucker.

890
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:06,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, because I hate playing guitar here, and I don't know why the fuck I keep buying this shit.

891
00:54:06,673 --> 00:54:07,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting the bundle.

892
00:54:07,673 --> 00:54:08,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can.

893
00:54:08,993 --> 00:54:09,773
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are made of money.

894
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:10,693
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

895
00:54:10,813 --> 00:54:11,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not made of money.

896
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:14,474
[SPEAKER_05]: The bundle's worth it if you're going to get anything, everything, anyway.

897
00:54:14,554 --> 00:54:14,794
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

898
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:15,214
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

899
00:54:15,314 --> 00:54:16,615
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not going to, then you better.

900
00:54:16,655 --> 00:54:16,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Rob.

901
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:21,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I've cut down on my buying of 360 games, so I don't have to really worry about, you know, I'm saving up.

902
00:54:22,436 --> 00:54:22,736
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

903
00:54:22,996 --> 00:54:24,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not your mommy.

904
00:54:24,096 --> 00:54:24,536
[SPEAKER_08]: You can buy.

905
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:25,997
[SPEAKER_08]: You can spend your money however you want.

906
00:54:26,037 --> 00:54:26,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying.

907
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:26,477
$170.

908
00:54:26,537 --> 00:54:27,657
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot of money.

909
00:54:27,677 --> 00:54:27,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

910
00:54:29,126 --> 00:54:39,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really, because I mean, if I don't, you know, go out for lunch during my work week, then after, you know, a few weeks, that's enough to pay for the game.

911
00:54:40,755 --> 00:54:42,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, next month is going to be slim for me anyway.

912
00:54:43,757 --> 00:54:44,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

913
00:54:44,938 --> 00:54:49,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Xenocor, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but any other quick last comments?

914
00:54:50,382 --> 00:54:51,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's pretty much it, guys.

915
00:54:51,683 --> 00:54:52,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk to you guys later.

916
00:54:52,643 --> 00:54:53,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, take care, Xenocor.

917
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:54,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

918
00:54:54,785 --> 00:54:55,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

919
00:54:55,578 --> 00:54:57,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is the first time he's been on the program, actually.

920
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember him calling in before.

921
00:55:00,121 --> 00:55:00,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe he did once.

922
00:55:01,582 --> 00:55:04,264
[SPEAKER_08]: But appreciate always hearing from the people we don't often hear from.

923
00:55:04,585 --> 00:55:09,368
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also appreciate hearing from the people we do often hear from, which I believe is our next call.

924
00:55:09,428 --> 00:55:10,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

925
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:12,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's Ranma.

926
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,051
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, everyone?

927
00:55:13,131 --> 00:55:13,892
[SPEAKER_08]: What'd I tell you?

928
00:55:13,932 --> 00:55:14,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, everyone.

929
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:16,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma, how you doing?

930
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:16,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.

931
00:55:17,935 --> 00:55:23,539
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just said because the last caller was someone we don't hear from a lot, but now we're hearing from someone we do hear from a lot, but that's all right.

932
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:23,899
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

933
00:55:24,966 --> 00:55:25,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much, not much.

934
00:55:26,046 --> 00:55:28,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Sky, I know you're pro-Ninja.

935
00:55:28,047 --> 00:55:32,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to send you a Ninjas vs. Pirates shirt where Ninjas win 4-3.

936
00:55:32,589 --> 00:55:33,109
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

937
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:34,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

938
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:35,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, definitely.

939
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:37,111
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't hate Pirates.

940
00:55:37,151 --> 00:55:41,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, usually, you know, in the Ninja vs. Pirate war, you have to love one and hate the others.

941
00:55:41,593 --> 00:55:42,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't hate Pirates.

942
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:43,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I respect Pirates.

943
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,075
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're just, you know, they're just inferior to Ninjas.

944
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:49,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, Ninjas are cooler.

945
00:55:49,276 --> 00:55:49,676
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

946
00:55:50,436 --> 00:55:50,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

947
00:55:50,996 --> 00:55:51,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry.

948
00:55:51,957 --> 00:55:53,397
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you want to call us to talk about tonight?

949
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:54,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Surely it wasn't Pirates vs. Ninjas.

950
00:55:55,524 --> 00:55:57,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, I got a couple of game reviews for you.

951
00:55:57,425 --> 00:55:58,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Woohoo, what games?

952
00:55:59,346 --> 00:56:02,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Puzzle Quest for the DS and The Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

953
00:56:02,768 --> 00:56:05,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's start with Puzzle Quest for the DS because it's the older game.

954
00:56:05,169 --> 00:56:05,569
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?

955
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:10,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I should have waited until the game dropped in 1999.

956
00:56:10,812 --> 00:56:12,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh snap, not a big fan, huh?

957
00:56:13,153 --> 00:56:18,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I am a big fan of Bejeweled and a friend of mine bought it and I really didn't know too much about it.

958
00:56:18,255 --> 00:56:19,856
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, it's just like Bejeweled.

959
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:21,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, really?

960
00:56:21,697 --> 00:56:23,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Went out like a couple of weeks later and I bought it.

961
00:56:24,116 --> 00:56:32,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the puzzle aspect, the puzzle RPG element of it, but it's just that when you're looking at the game, it's like you're not sure where to begin.

962
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:34,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to build up your gold?

963
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to start fighting the creature, build up your experience?

964
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:47,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just got to be very careful in the patterns that you move because you make the wrong move, your opponent's going to hit like a 5-6 chain combo, then you're like really screwed.

965
00:56:48,502 --> 00:56:49,002
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

966
00:57:13,846 --> 00:57:16,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, my wife's not having trouble beating the game.

967
00:57:16,248 --> 00:57:17,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, your wife has a super brain or something.

968
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:20,272
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know, it's just a different way of thinking about it.

969
00:57:20,412 --> 00:57:21,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a few words for you, Loki, okay?

970
00:57:39,173 --> 00:57:42,675
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people I know that have beat the game, but it's a different way of thinking about it.

971
00:57:42,715 --> 00:57:45,196
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't play it like you're playing Bejeweled, because you'll be screwed.

972
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:47,576
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about the skulls.

973
00:57:47,857 --> 00:57:55,559
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to look at the screen and make sure there's no skulls that you can line up first, because if you don't get it, I swear to God, the computer will every time.

974
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:58,420
[SPEAKER_08]: They're ruthless, but that's a challenge.

975
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I love unlocking stuff in the game.

976
00:58:01,402 --> 00:58:07,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if I could just sit there and do those puzzles all day, it just kills my entire time on the train going to work.

977
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:11,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe this game's worth a little more than giving it credit for.

978
00:58:11,732 --> 00:58:12,892
[SPEAKER_08]: So what don't you like about the game?

979
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:16,254
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that really gets on me is the music.

980
00:58:16,314 --> 00:58:22,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yes, it's supposed to be a medieval style, but the music can be so low that I find myself almost passing out and going to sleep.

981
00:58:23,217 --> 00:58:23,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you that.

982
00:58:23,757 --> 00:58:25,158
[SPEAKER_08]: The music's a little generic in the game.

983
00:58:25,198 --> 00:58:26,018
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing too special.

984
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:30,140
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, tell us a little more about the other game you're going to review.

985
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:30,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it Phantom Hourglass?

986
00:58:31,661 --> 00:58:32,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Phantom Hourglass.

987
00:58:32,681 --> 00:58:33,662
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so good.

988
00:58:34,102 --> 00:58:34,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it?

989
00:58:35,444 --> 00:58:41,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I mean, I'm playing it, I'm like, this is so much like a Link to the Past to me, the way they have it set up.

990
00:58:42,409 --> 00:58:44,051
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what it reminds me so much of.

991
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:54,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I didn't even know you controlled Link with the stylus, I bought the game, and I'm like, I don't know if I'm going to like this, but ten minutes in, I'm like, okay, I could definitely rock this.

992
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,060
[SPEAKER_04]: This is it, this is fun.

993
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:57,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

994
00:58:57,601 --> 00:59:01,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I see, I'm still not sure how I feel about it, but I'm going to try and borrow it from my friend.

995
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:07,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm starting to get poor from all these games I'm buying, so I definitely want to try and borrow it from somewhere, but that's kind of cool.

996
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:12,783
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, how does it compare to other handheld Zelda games?

997
00:59:12,863 --> 00:59:20,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, does the whole stylus element just really change things for the better, for the worse, or just the new gen, or whatever you want to call it?

998
00:59:21,386 --> 00:59:23,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it makes things for the better, though.

999
00:59:23,787 --> 00:59:32,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because the last bunch of portable Zelda games, what do we have, like Oracle of Ages, Oracle of Seasons, A Link to the Past, the port of that, you know?

1000
00:59:34,111 --> 00:59:35,251
[SPEAKER_08]: None of those were bad games.

1001
00:59:36,092 --> 00:59:36,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1002
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:40,453
[SPEAKER_08]: But they were just kind of the Super Nintendo games in handheld form.

1003
00:59:40,853 --> 00:59:41,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.

1004
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:42,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you hold up one second?

1005
00:59:42,674 --> 00:59:43,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1006
00:59:43,694 --> 00:59:44,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we just get put on hold?

1007
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:45,695
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

1008
00:59:46,395 --> 00:59:50,537
[SPEAKER_04]: My roommate's playing Guitar Hero 3, and I think he's on the very last song.

1009
00:59:50,997 --> 00:59:51,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my gosh.

1010
00:59:52,637 --> 00:59:53,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1011
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:53,838
[SPEAKER_08]: How funny.

1012
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:55,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1013
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:56,339
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty hardcore.

1014
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,099
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to be playing that game a lot to get that far.

1015
00:59:58,419 --> 01:00:00,340
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Ranma, any other quick thoughts?

1016
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:00,940
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to let you go.

1017
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Try to take one more call before we sign off.

1018
01:00:03,817 --> 01:00:08,681
[SPEAKER_04]: About Loki's tingle costume, teal green or bright green?

1019
01:00:09,682 --> 01:00:10,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to make him a costume?

1020
01:00:11,744 --> 01:00:14,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I know people that will do it.

1021
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:16,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't put the cart before the horse.

1022
01:00:16,688 --> 01:00:18,489
[SPEAKER_08]: The game has to sell a million copies first.

1023
01:00:18,509 --> 01:00:19,951
[SPEAKER_08]: I ain't going to sell a million copies.

1024
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:23,333
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay because I can get the fabric for cheap either way.

1025
01:00:23,393 --> 01:00:24,675
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a win-win situation.

1026
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:27,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure it's a darker green, very similar to what Link wears.

1027
01:00:28,238 --> 01:00:31,120
[SPEAKER_08]: But when the game sells you a million copies, we'll send you Loki's measurements.

1028
01:00:31,989 --> 01:00:33,931
[SPEAKER_07]: is not going to sell a million copies.

1029
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:34,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It's totally not.

1030
01:00:34,592 --> 01:00:38,335
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be extremely, extremely unlikely.

1031
01:00:38,355 --> 01:00:40,857
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have to admit, what a hilarious Christmas gift that would be.

1032
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:42,939
[SPEAKER_10]: The ultimate gag gift.

1033
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it wouldn't be Christmas since it's six months from now.

1034
01:00:46,763 --> 01:00:50,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Ranma, we've got to let you go, but thanks so much for calling in, alright?

1035
01:00:50,887 --> 01:00:51,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

1036
01:00:52,828 --> 01:00:55,671
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a fun six-year anniversary gift.

1037
01:00:56,272 --> 01:00:56,732
[SPEAKER_07]: For the show.

1038
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:57,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because that

1039
01:00:59,553 --> 01:01:05,156
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura and I might have to go to Hancock Fabrics or whatever fabric stores are out there and go get some fabric.

1040
01:01:05,176 --> 01:01:05,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to LA.

1041
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Or just go to New York and meet up with Ranma's friends.

1042
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:10,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is going to be the last call tonight, folks.

1043
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:11,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1044
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:12,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

1045
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,199
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Puppy.

1046
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Puppy!

1047
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:17,241
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1048
01:01:17,281 --> 01:01:18,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Why aren't you in studio tonight?

1049
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:19,702
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a fourth mic now.

1050
01:01:21,162 --> 01:01:21,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you do?

1051
01:01:21,783 --> 01:01:24,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I have a guitar here with me and that's what I've been busy with today.

1052
01:01:25,364 --> 01:01:26,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Fair enough, fair enough.

1053
01:01:26,304 --> 01:01:26,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how was the game?

1054
01:01:26,985 --> 01:01:27,625
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you enjoying it?

1055
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:29,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it a lot.

1056
01:01:30,149 --> 01:01:42,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a little bit teed off at the amount of selling out that Activision did with the game because by the time I got to the third set of songs, I had already seen like four new companies advertising in the game.

1057
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

1058
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:46,062
[SPEAKER_08]: How did they advertise the companies in the game?

1059
01:01:46,082 --> 01:01:47,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Because maybe I'm just oblivious.

1060
01:01:47,243 --> 01:01:48,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally missed it.

1061
01:01:49,245 --> 01:01:53,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, other than the Guitar Center stuff from the store... That I did notice.

1062
01:01:53,228 --> 01:01:53,689
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen...

1063
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:59,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw there was Axe doing some stuff.

1064
01:01:59,413 --> 01:02:07,641
[SPEAKER_10]: They have Axe guitar patterns and these Axe girls that come out and dance during some of the encore stages.

1065
01:02:07,741 --> 01:02:08,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1066
01:02:08,202 --> 01:02:19,473
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Pontiac came out and there's one whole stage where it's just like the Pontiac garage like from Jimmy Kimmel Live or whatever it is because it's supposed to be some sort of fancy music video set.

1067
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:20,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1068
01:02:20,814 --> 01:02:23,596
[SPEAKER_07]: and a Pontiac car comes and runs you over.

1069
01:02:23,616 --> 01:02:24,496
[SPEAKER_07]: That's hilarious.

1070
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:32,041
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, I look at this and go, okay, would I rather we have the Pontiac stage of Guitar Hero or the Yaris game?

1071
01:02:32,061 --> 01:02:38,365
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, here's one thing that they forgot to mention about Guitar Hero that's really fucking awesome.

1072
01:02:38,525 --> 01:02:41,667
[SPEAKER_07]: The intro and the fucking cut scenes that are in this game.

1073
01:02:42,047 --> 01:02:42,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the cartoons.

1074
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:44,209
[SPEAKER_07]: They're awesome.

1075
01:02:44,229 --> 01:02:47,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't they just do a Guitar Hero cartoon series?

1076
01:02:47,891 --> 01:02:49,712
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be fucking cooler than the game.

1077
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:56,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki feels very strongly about his dislike of Guitar Hero over here.

1078
01:02:57,057 --> 01:02:58,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, they've already done that before.

1079
01:02:58,838 --> 01:03:07,323
[SPEAKER_07]: It was called Legend of Black Heaven, and it was an anime thing about this middle-aged guy who becomes a rocker again and fights aliens, and it's awesome.

1080
01:03:07,343 --> 01:03:10,825
[SPEAKER_08]: The cartoons, the cutscenes made me think of, what the hell's Metalocalypse?

1081
01:03:10,985 --> 01:03:12,166
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that show on Cartoon Network?

1082
01:03:12,486 --> 01:03:14,047
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Metalocalypse.

1083
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:14,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1084
01:03:14,908 --> 01:03:16,989
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the cartoon things made me think of.

1085
01:03:17,569 --> 01:03:19,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't watch that show a whole lot, but anyway, I'm sorry, Bubby.

1086
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:20,611
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be funny.

1087
01:03:21,191 --> 01:03:22,172
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be funny enough.

1088
01:03:22,617 --> 01:03:27,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so what did you, we made you talk about Guitar Hero, what did you actually want to call in and talk about tonight?

1089
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:49,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, other than Guitar Hero, yeah, that's what I've been spending most of my time on, but I just was wondering also, you know, you were mentioning earlier about the Halo 3 downloading videos and game views and stuff like that, and I was wondering if you had actually seen a bunch of the stuff that had been coming out recently with all the

1090
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:56,032
[SPEAKER_10]: All the funny little clips of people getting killed by cones and shooting themselves in the head with sniper rifles.

1091
01:03:56,392 --> 01:03:59,193
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but you need to send me some of the best ones, and I will.

1092
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:02,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Simply because I've been playing so many other games since Halo.

1093
01:04:02,394 --> 01:04:07,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Because now we're getting into that gaming barrage where it seems like every week I'm playing a new game I want to play.

1094
01:04:07,596 --> 01:04:09,476
[SPEAKER_08]: And then next year I'm going to go back and catch up on everything.

1095
01:04:09,816 --> 01:04:12,077
[SPEAKER_08]: So at some point I will have to go get that.

1096
01:04:12,117 --> 01:04:15,058
[SPEAKER_08]: But I love taking the pictures and putting them online.

1097
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:17,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, forget looking at other people's stuff.

1098
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I like playing with my own stuff.

1099
01:04:18,679 --> 01:04:20,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff that I create is fun.

1100
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,782
[SPEAKER_08]: But to be honest, I haven't touched Halo 3 in about a week at least.

1101
01:04:22,962 --> 01:04:26,405
[SPEAKER_08]: So I need to look up some of this funny stuff.

1102
01:04:26,605 --> 01:04:28,566
[SPEAKER_08]: So please send me some funny ones.

1103
01:04:28,746 --> 01:04:32,469
[SPEAKER_10]: A bunch of this stuff is actually on YouTube, some of the more popular stuff.

1104
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:35,391
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's all free advertising for Halo 3.

1105
01:04:36,512 --> 01:04:37,353
[SPEAKER_08]: All free advertising.

1106
01:04:38,694 --> 01:04:39,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, definitely.

1107
01:04:39,654 --> 01:04:40,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Bungie's loving it.

1108
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in all honesty, all that money probably went to the celebrities that they had in the game.

1109
01:04:43,301 --> 01:04:43,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they got Slash and...

1110
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:11,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Tom Morello, and I think a lot of original versions of songs too.

1111
01:05:12,088 --> 01:05:19,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and like the lead singer from Poison, I forgot what his name was, Brett Michaels, he did all the motion capture for the singers in the game.

1112
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:26,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you, what did you think of the new version of Anarchy in the UK?

1113
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:29,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't gotten that one.

1114
01:05:29,831 --> 01:05:32,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I never had heard that song before, so I honestly don't know.

1115
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:36,032
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the first time I think the Sex Pistols have been together since the 70s.

1116
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:38,342
[SPEAKER_03]: to record anything.

1117
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:42,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw that that was an unlockable video that you could get, so I might have to check that out.

1118
01:05:43,004 --> 01:05:47,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the old song, and I know the bad, bad guitar freaks cover, but I'm curious about what this is.

1119
01:05:47,747 --> 01:05:50,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, they must have been hard up for money then.

1120
01:05:51,549 --> 01:05:52,009
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know.

1121
01:05:52,629 --> 01:05:56,491
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, Puppy, we've got to let you go because we're going to go wrap up the show, but thanks so much for calling, all right?

1122
01:05:57,492 --> 01:05:57,812
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1123
01:05:57,972 --> 01:05:59,933
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, and come back to the show in the future.

1124
01:06:00,113 --> 01:06:00,914
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't live that far away.

1125
01:06:00,954 --> 01:06:01,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.

1126
01:06:01,474 --> 01:06:02,074
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you better.

1127
01:06:02,094 --> 01:06:02,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try to.

1128
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,635
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, take care.

1129
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:05,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1130
01:06:05,056 --> 01:06:05,116
Bye.

1131
01:06:05,652 --> 01:06:11,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Escapist in our chatroom says, Brett Michaels should have paid to be in Guitar Hero 3 instead of being paid.

1132
01:06:12,115 --> 01:06:12,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of agree.

1133
01:06:13,036 --> 01:06:14,596
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great exposure for these folks.

1134
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:20,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And in some extent, I mean, I don't know, God, maybe I'll say something controversial here, but some of these people are kind of washed up.

1135
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Brett Michaels, I mean, well, he has that show on VH1, but, you know.

1136
01:06:25,141 --> 01:06:27,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that doesn't make him washed up at all.

1137
01:06:27,042 --> 01:06:27,603
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's true.

1138
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:28,523
[SPEAKER_07]: He's on VH1.

1139
01:06:28,823 --> 01:06:31,384
[SPEAKER_07]: That's usually a sign of being a washed up celebrity.

1140
01:06:32,065 --> 01:06:32,605
[SPEAKER_08]: True, true.

1141
01:06:33,562 --> 01:06:40,645
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, I don't know, Slash is a great guitarist, but the mainstream doesn't talk about Slash, but now they might.

1142
01:06:41,086 --> 01:06:43,827
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're right, these guys maybe ought to be paying them to be in the game.

1143
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:44,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

1144
01:06:45,888 --> 01:06:50,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, we've been going at this a long time, so I think it's finally time to wrap this up and call it a night.

1145
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:54,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1146
01:06:54,232 --> 01:06:55,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, we didn't get last minute stories.

1147
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:56,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Did we have more last minute stories?

1148
01:06:56,593 --> 01:06:57,573
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't get any last minute stories.

1149
01:06:57,593 --> 01:06:59,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, then let's get last minute stories real quick.

1150
01:06:59,534 --> 01:07:01,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so a few things.

1151
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:08,516
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, let's see, GameStop's dropped their Xbox 360 product replacement plans.

1152
01:07:09,437 --> 01:07:11,719
[SPEAKER_07]: So apparently now they're no longer fixing those.

1153
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:15,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Microsoft will have to do more of that.

1154
01:07:15,703 --> 01:07:16,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

1155
01:07:17,545 --> 01:07:19,847
[SPEAKER_07]: GripShift has been rated for the Xbox 360.

1156
01:07:20,187 --> 01:07:22,389
[SPEAKER_07]: If you might remember, that was a crappy-ass game.

1157
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:26,173
[SPEAKER_07]: They came out on the PlayStation Network and also on the PSP.

1158
01:07:26,857 --> 01:07:27,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I highly recommend it.

1159
01:07:27,617 --> 01:07:30,638
[SPEAKER_07]: If it does come out on Live Arcade, do not fucking buy it.

1160
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:33,599
[SPEAKER_07]: It's horrible, horrible, horrible.

1161
01:07:33,959 --> 01:07:38,801
[SPEAKER_07]: That crappy Xbox Live Arcade game stick is now 50% cheaper in the UK.

1162
01:07:39,341 --> 01:07:40,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Still shouldn't buy it, though.

1163
01:07:41,722 --> 01:07:48,644
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a wonderful application made by Microsoft, I guess, employee Adam Keener, or Kenny?

1164
01:07:49,305 --> 01:07:49,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Keeney?

1165
01:07:49,805 --> 01:07:50,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1166
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:53,124
[SPEAKER_07]: XBOX Live Friend Tracker TV Program Schedule Channel

1167
01:08:18,456 --> 01:08:29,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about you but I'm pretty sure on most cable networks especially if it's satellite or digital cable there's a guide button on your remote to see what's on TV.

1168
01:08:29,745 --> 01:08:32,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we really need this on here?

1169
01:08:32,307 --> 01:08:35,890
[SPEAKER_07]: People are speculating, oh it's going to lead to an IPTV channel.

1170
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:38,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, where the fuck are you going to store that shit on the Wii?

1171
01:08:38,972 --> 01:08:39,853
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'd like to know.

1172
01:08:42,075 --> 01:08:47,539
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're ordering Super Mario Galaxy you ain't getting your pre-order coin until the fucking game comes out.

1173
01:08:48,052 --> 01:08:51,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that you really should order the game because of that coin.

1174
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:56,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, might remind you that that game is going to be fucking hard to find around the holidays.

1175
01:08:56,176 --> 01:08:58,898
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you haven't pre-ordered it yet, it's time to do it.

1176
01:08:58,998 --> 01:09:03,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's going to be like the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess where it's near impossible to find.

1177
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,302
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, Gran Turismo 5.

1178
01:09:07,463 --> 01:09:09,904
[SPEAKER_07]: They've had some of the features announced for it.

1179
01:09:10,224 --> 01:09:15,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Including there's going to be an online garage course, online head-to-head racing, time trials.

1180
01:09:15,886 --> 01:09:36,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Track of the Day, B-Spec Race, License Test, Drift Contest, Tuning and Setting Features, Friends List, Lobby, Voice Chat, Bulletin Board, Spectator Mode, Team Building, Club Building, Color and other editors and looks like some other fun stuff.

1181
01:09:36,482 --> 01:09:37,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So photo albums also.

1182
01:09:38,224 --> 01:09:42,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of wonderful features for a game that's not going to come out until Christmas of next year.

1183
01:09:43,127 --> 01:09:43,708
[SPEAKER_07]: If that.

1184
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:56,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and by the way, there's also something fun in the little Sears ad that was on gonintendo.com, and I tell you, this also tickles me rose and gold as well.

1185
01:09:58,872 --> 01:09:59,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

1186
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:12,384
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, it also, they basically have the two DS Lite bundles, one with Triforces on it, one with a paw print, the one with the Triforces gold comes with Zelda, the one with the paw print comes with a special edition of Nintendogs.

1187
01:10:13,396 --> 01:10:13,916
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

1188
01:10:43,627 --> 01:10:46,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry that I forgot to bring you the lotion I was going to bring you.

1189
01:10:46,769 --> 01:10:47,810
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can give it to you tomorrow.

1190
01:10:48,211 --> 01:10:48,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1191
01:10:48,771 --> 01:10:49,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you want to come by.

1192
01:10:49,972 --> 01:10:53,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about tomorrow because tomorrow is the boyfriend's birthday.

1193
01:10:54,015 --> 01:10:59,219
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're pretty busy, but maybe... Go look for anything with Arnica in it.

1194
01:10:59,639 --> 01:10:59,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1195
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:04,583
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my natural remedies session.

1196
01:11:04,903 --> 01:11:06,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I need something for my toothache.

1197
01:11:06,705 --> 01:11:07,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Clove oil.

1198
01:11:07,465 --> 01:11:09,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't want to go to the dentist because I hate going to the dentist.

1199
01:11:09,707 --> 01:11:09,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Clove oil.

1200
01:11:09,947 --> 01:11:10,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a used car salesman.

1201
01:11:11,008 --> 01:11:11,228
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1202
01:11:11,857 --> 01:11:12,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Clove oil.

1203
01:11:12,858 --> 01:11:13,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Not on the gum, but on the tooth.

1204
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:14,579
[SPEAKER_08]: On the tooth.

1205
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,781
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they used to use in dentist's office back in the day.

1206
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:18,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1207
01:11:19,122 --> 01:11:32,011
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, I'm going to be very strict for the next three weeks until Thanksgiving because when I go to Alabama, I am going to eat fried chicken and grits and fried chicken liver.

1208
01:11:32,651 --> 01:11:33,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't talk about food.

1209
01:11:33,452 --> 01:11:34,092
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds yummy.

1210
01:11:34,152 --> 01:11:35,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Fried chicken sounds good right now.

1211
01:11:35,093 --> 01:11:35,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I love fried chicken liver.

1212
01:11:36,374 --> 01:11:38,315
[SPEAKER_03]: With country gravy, I'm going to have fried catfish.

1213
01:11:39,187 --> 01:11:40,448
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm not going to do anything.

1214
01:11:40,488 --> 01:11:42,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a vacation from everything.

1215
01:11:43,369 --> 01:11:44,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And Sauce is coming with me.

1216
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:48,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And all we're going to do is sit and watch movies and eat.

1217
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like fun.

1218
01:11:49,771 --> 01:11:50,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds beautiful.

1219
01:11:50,832 --> 01:11:55,694
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have to be extra, you know, constant vigilance for the next three weeks.

1220
01:11:55,914 --> 01:12:00,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of food, I just want to say this real quick since we love to talk about, like when we're not talking about games, we're talking about food, right?

1221
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:01,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1222
01:12:01,436 --> 01:12:02,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I had dim summer today.

1223
01:12:02,797 --> 01:12:03,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I love dim summer.

1224
01:12:03,517 --> 01:12:04,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, so good.

1225
01:12:04,537 --> 01:12:08,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Because like we went to one of those like authentic Chinese places that have like the duck feet and everything.

1226
01:12:08,744 --> 01:12:10,185
[SPEAKER_08]: or not duck feet, chicken feet.

1227
01:12:10,965 --> 01:12:15,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't have any of that because I just don't like chicken feet, but there was some real good food today.

1228
01:12:16,268 --> 01:12:19,970
[SPEAKER_08]: That shrimp wrapped up in pasta was so good.

1229
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:21,991
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual spring rolls.

1230
01:12:22,991 --> 01:12:23,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they had those too.

1231
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:26,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go to In-N-Out.

1232
01:12:26,573 --> 01:12:29,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have a chocolate strawberry shake and animal style fries for dinner.

1233
01:12:29,915 --> 01:12:30,495
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1234
01:12:31,115 --> 01:12:31,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Good stuff.

1235
01:12:31,776 --> 01:12:32,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow I'm having vegetables.

1236
01:12:33,457 --> 01:12:34,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, sorry.

1237
01:12:34,637 --> 01:12:35,257
[SPEAKER_08]: All the food talk.

1238
01:12:35,277 --> 01:12:36,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Your final thought, Loki.

1239
01:12:36,278 --> 01:12:38,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a lot of games to play this week and not a lot of time.

1240
01:12:41,553 --> 01:12:42,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Well said.

1241
01:12:43,214 --> 01:12:44,615
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's going to bring our show to a close.

1242
01:12:44,655 --> 01:12:45,756
[SPEAKER_08]: We're done tonight, folks.

1245
01:12:54,442 --> 01:12:55,963
[SPEAKER_08]: We are independent after all.

1246
01:12:56,603 --> 01:12:58,104
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't really profit from doing this.

1247
01:12:59,786 --> 01:13:06,270
[SPEAKER_08]: We spend our time to bring this to you for the past five and a half years because we love you and our live listeners and you guys that stick with us.

01:13:07,291 --> 01:13:07,891
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all we ask.
