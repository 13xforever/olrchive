00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday, October the 28th, 2007

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
for this Part B of our program.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Since we already talked about our gaming weeks and all that stuff in Part A,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
you can hear about my injury and all that fun stuff.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You gotta go back in the archives though and grab Part A because we're already in the second half.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And in the second half we started off with gaming news.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Loki, what do you got for us?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Anyways, what I got for you is a brand new thing that they're adding to the Wii Virtual Console.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's the ability to give games as gifts apparently.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So you can purchase a Virtual Console game and then put one of your friends' names on there

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and it will automatically send them a message allowing them to download the game.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So that's kind of cool except it doesn't address the fact that what if the person already has the game.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's exactly what I want to know. What if somebody tries to send me a game which I already have?

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Too bad, I guess. I don't know.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Huh.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I think that they should have the option where you can send, and this should be in all the online things,

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
at least in Microsoft, they should have an option where you can send people points.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Without having to go buy one of those cards that's taxed?

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Example, I have my account on Live and then I have those four other Xbox 360s.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Say I want to download a map or something on all of them.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't want to fucking have to put in billing information for five different 360s.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'd rather just send 200 points it costs to buy this map to each one.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't know why you can't do that.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Can't you just tie it to your Live name and then go on each?

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, because you have to have a different name for each one because it has to be tied to that account.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's stupid. Interesting.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So this basically sounds like it's something that's in the very early stages that they haven't really mapped out

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
like how you're going to give the gifts or any of that yet, right?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Was it supposed to be some massive Wii update last month that didn't actually end up happening?

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Do you think it'll be here in time for the holiday season which is just around the corner?

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I hope so. I hope they have that.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm kind of curious what they're plotting because you know how Nintendo likes to slowly pull off the wrapping on things, you know what I mean?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, anyhow, the one thing that's getting the wrapping pulled off of it this week is Virtual Console in Japan.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The Virtual Console release has come out in Japan on Tuesdays and this week in Japan they got a little game called

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Downtown Nekkitsu Koshinyoku Soroyuki Daikodai.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I know what that is.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What would you call that?

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We would call that River City Ransom in the US.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right. You would call it River City Ransom.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I have the TurboGrafx CD version.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right. So I came out on the Virtual Console this week for 600 Wii points.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Donkey Kong Country 2 also came out.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Dinah Brothers 2 Special came out as well as Choaniki came out.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm not even kidding.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Somebody brought that up in part A.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Choaniki came out as well and then Ragai Blues Journey.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But what should be pointed out, I believe one of these games, wasn't that a Sega Channel game or something like that?

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The Dinah Brothers 2?

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I believe it might have been.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So kind of interesting there that, wait a minute, Sega Channel?

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What kind of thing does this open up the Virtual Console to?

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
How about some Nintendo Channel releases?

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Or what did they call that?

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Was it the BS or something?

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The Satellaview.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, Satellaview, that's it.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
BS was what it was for short.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So that would be cool if we got the Zelda remake over here and that kind of stuff.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I've played a ROM of it.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Maybe I'm just dreaming a little bit. I don't know.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, for our friends in the UK, they get some cool stuff.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The coolest being Yoshi's Story that was on the Nintendo 64 for a thousand Wii points.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yoshi's Story was a very, very cute game.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's all I have to say.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And, as I mentioned in part A, Super Air Zonk! Rockabilly Paradise!

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Which was a Turbo CD shooter.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They've removed a few of the graphical features to it.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And they have instead basically just beefed up the soundtrack a bit.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So, Super Air Zonk.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And also, Magician Lord 900 points.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a Neo Geo game.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I have yet to download a Neo Geo game onto my Wii.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I just, I don't know.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Get Magician Lord.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I kind of want it, but I don't know.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Magician Lord is great.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Magician Lord is one of those games that are like, ooh, it was so awesome.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And then I downloaded it ten years ago.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Wow, this wasn't that good. What the hell was I thinking on that?

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I remember it being very hard.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's like how Virtual Console does all of its businesses off of reactions like that.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Like, oh, remember this game? This game was awesome.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And then you download it and you're like, wait, no it wasn't.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's why they don't have demos.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I guess, probably.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You know, we still need to do Super Metroid, Rob.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We do.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Anyway.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's make it happen.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can't do a lot of physical stuff this week thanks to my injury, so maybe we'll have to do it this week.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Dude, no, no, no.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
GS68 said it.

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Blazing Star on Wii.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's like one of my favorite ever Neo Geo games.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We'll see.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Polestar was a good game, but Blazing Star was freaking awesome.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Someday.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Apparently there's a rumor going around that Nintendo is planning on adding flash card support to the Nintendo DS.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Now, I'm sure that there are, many people know that there is flash card support for the DS.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
In a not so official, not entirely legal way.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But they will be, the rumor is that they're going to be offering this as part of a download service that will allow you to put Game Boy and Game Boy Color games onto your DS.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Say, maybe via, I don't know, Virtual Console or something like that.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Where you can download your games using the little SD memory card.

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Pop it out of your Wii, plug it into your DS and take it on the go.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Hell, they should just do that with the NES games and stuff like that.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That'd be fucking awesome.

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That'd be a really added value to the Virtual Console games I've already downloaded.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But, of course, why would they have to give this to us for free, right?

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Those charges to do that, right?

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Exactly.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Like I said earlier, Nintendo is all about, especially with these Virtual Console releases, us remembering,

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
wow, this game was awesome, and then we'll go, no it wasn't. Same thing with the Game Boy releases, right?

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But who knows, maybe Jamie will be able to get Kid Dracula through the service.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That might be kind of cool for her.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Actually, I'd want to play it too.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Here's a problem though I see with this, and I don't know how it would work, is how would you be able to say if I put a copy of Super Mario Land or something like that on my memory stick or whatever.

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And Super Mario Land will be one of those games.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Exactly.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's say I put it on my SD memory card. How's that card going to know which DS it's going into?

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
For example, basically that would allow you to rip the ROMs and just distribute them freely.

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It'd be hard for them to be able to lock that down to one DS.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why can't it just beam the game over the Wi-Fi?

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Because the DS has no internal memory to store the game.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Once it's beamed over the Wi-Fi, you save it to the, I don't know, maybe you link it up with a unique ID, like a friend code type thing? I don't know.

132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Well, I don't know. If you save it to like, maybe the friend code thing could work, I guess. I don't know. It would still be very hard.

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hmm.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
All right, well, coming out on the Nintendo Wii is a sequel to a very obscure game.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know if a lot of folks know about this game in the arcades.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think, if I remember right, you know how we're syndicated on AllGames.com, right?

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
AllGames has their daily show, the AllGames Interactive Show, and I think this is kind of an inside joke on their show is the game Crazy Climber,

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
which is this old game from the 80s, which was in the arcades.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You basically played this guy crawling up the side of a building very slowly.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And I know that it's a joke on that show because they have that sound effect, the,

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
oh no, whenever you fall off the building, right? Well, get this.

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Crazy Climber is being remade for the Wii.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And this just struck me as like very odd when I read about it. I'm like, really?

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Out of like all the games they could pick, they're remaking Crazy Climber?

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Who's publishing that?

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Crazy Climber is being made by Nihon Busan is doing the publisher there.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Crazy Climber Wii is coming out. It kind of looks interesting from the screenshots,

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
but you actually use the Wii remote and the nunchuck to climb up the building,

149
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
which is kind of an interesting concept, you have to say.

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The only thing that scares me about this, though, is the fact that they have a game like

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Impossible Mission, or not, yeah, Impossible Mission, and they also had Spy Game,

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
what was that, Elevator Mission or some shit like that, that was really crappy.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Well, you can pick different characters from the game to play as.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And there's this one character called Fox who looks to be a foxy little girl,

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
or actually, big girl.

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So, you know, kind of a little spin on the 80s thing where the 80s thing only had the one guy,

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and somebody actually in chat has posted the link to the clip.

158
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let me see if I can bring this up.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is a great radio right now while I go and retrieve that clip.

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's see, this is the death noise from the 80s Crazy Climber game.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, no!

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, so that's that cheesy little sound effect you'll hear whenever the character dies in the game.

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So, there you have it.

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So I wonder if that classic sound effect will actually come back in the new Crazy Climber.

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Who knows?

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, I'm thinking about modding my Wii, and this comes out in Japan on December 20th,

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
so, you know, I'll be able to play region free.

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you don't get locked out with some future dashboard update, be careful.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, whatever.

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Sorry, that's 360, but whatever, the interface update.

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Alright, that's enough Crazy Climber.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So crazy.

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Thank God.

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, I'm kidding.

175
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
There's a rumor floating around, this is all purely speculation, honestly.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't think there's much actual fact in this,

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
that Animal Crossing will be going the way of the MMO.

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't think it will happen anytime soon, if it does.

179
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And it's really all based off of Eguchi saying that they wanted to expand the connectivity to mobile phones and computers.

180
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
All of Chinese fruit sellers, you know, shaking my trees, stealing my fruit.

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Wow.

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah, that's so, I don't even see how you can grasp that straw.

183
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If it's going to happen, it'll be much further down.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You know, I could kind of see something like this happening for some reason.

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't know, it just seems like a very logical,

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and maybe that's why this is grabbing all this steam around the internet and is catching a lot of, you know, whatever.

188
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They've been saying it for years, though.

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And it would make sense.

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I mean, God, it would totally change the game, too, because on the DS it kind of felt a little bit like we'd all played before.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It felt forced.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, to be honest, I don't think they're going to do this,

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
because that would mean that Nintendo's actually getting with it, and we know that's not the case.

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
They're going to be opening themselves up to a lot of trouble, and you know that Nintendo plays it safe.

195
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Nintendo will decide, hey, you know what, let's run an Animal Crossing BBS, and then they'll go from there.

196
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And eventually you'll have your Animal Crossing chat room and your Animal Crossing game.

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't know, my gut tells me something like this is definitely possible.

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think this could happen.

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But we'll see.

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It'll happen, all right.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
In 2010.

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We'll see.

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Or never.

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm kind of afraid of it happening.

205
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
If it is an MMO, I'm going to come to Jamie's Village all the time and shake her trees.

206
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Who says I'll play it?

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, snap.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If it went the route of MMO, I don't think I'd play it.

209
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What if it was free?

210
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Like a Guild Wars style thing, or once you buy the game you can play it however much you want.

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
If somebody gives me the game, sure.

212
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You're not the Animal Crossing addict you used to be.

213
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No, not really.

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It just got really boring for me, and I'm already playing a good MMO right now.

215
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We'll see what happens.

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Anyways, interesting rumor that got leaked out this week is that there was a new character coming,

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
or that hasn't been announced yet, coming to Smash Brothers.

218
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
This actually happened via one of the voice actresses' blogs.

219
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Her personal webpage said the people that she's performing, the characters' voices for,

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
include Zero Suit Samus, as well as Crystal from Star Fox Adventures.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That, of course, was one of the ones that hasn't been announced yet.

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Crystal, the girl fox who's also in scanly clad blue.

223
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Of course, if you told me last week that King Dedede was going to be a character in the game,

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I would have said, yeah, right.

225
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And then look what happened.

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
By the way, that's too much Kirby in one game, I think.

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I know Kirby's great and all, but seriously, three characters, two of them a bit obscure.

228
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
King Dedede and Meta Knight?

229
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't know.

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
King Dedede is not obscure.

231
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I know, he's not obscure, but if you think of Kirby, you'd think of Kirby.

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What about that?

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Mr. Game & Watch was great.

234
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Mr. Game & Watch was great.

235
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That was a good unlocked character.

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It was kind of a throwback to Nintendo's history.

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I think King Dedede is a good addition and all,

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
but I think they should have just done away with Meta Knight in that case.

239
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Who's a Meta Knight fan?

240
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There's a lot of people now, but I don't know who the fuck King Dedede is.

241
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
All that reminds me of is fucking Carlos Mencia.

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You know what?

243
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Tiger Claw has a really good point in our chat room.

244
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
chat.orangelandrager.com

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Keep in mind, the creator of Smash Bros. Brawl also created Kirby.

246
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So, damn good point.

247
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Well, he's also created this, which for the Nintendo Wii is something a little bit unheard of,

248
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
which is getting people very excited.

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And of course, there's another target Smash mode yet again.

250
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We see this often in the Smash Bros. game.

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There's going to be a new target Smash mode in the game,

252
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
but what's very cool about it is that you can actually send your replays through target Smash mode

253
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
to other people on your Wii console friends list.

254
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
They even show pictures of it happening.

255
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So a lot of us are like, oh my gosh, we don't see a whole lot of this Wii Connect 24 thing going on right now.

256
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Like you have that one random EllaBits thing and a couple other,

257
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
but you don't see a whole lot of this like send game stuff to friends.

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So, very cool that this looks like it's going to be happening.

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
A real quick quote from the article.

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Quote, this time you can view replays.

261
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What this means is the game records what you did in brawls or in target Smash and lets you review it.

262
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And you can record up to three minutes of data.

263
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So not just in the target mode.

264
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It looks like you can actually do this in the actual brawls.

265
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's going to be fun.

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Now the next thing is we need to be able to post them to the internet.

267
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Download them there, kind of like Halo 3.

268
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Imagine some of the brawl matches we'd see on the site ready to download.

269
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That might be kind of fun. We'll see.

270
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Well, I'll tell you what is very happy for me is a zombie game on the DS.

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I love zombies.

272
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Zombies are pretty awesome.

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Ignition is releasing a game called Teenage Zombies Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies.

274
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Which is the best name ever.

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I was a teenage zombie?

276
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No, Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies.

277
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And it's basically the world is taken over by an alien or something called the big brain and the army of brain thingies.

278
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And so these zombies rise from their grave.

279
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Rise from your grave.

280
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
They're immune to the brain thingy ray and start eating people.

281
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's great.

282
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What exactly do you do in the game?

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It has a bunch of stylus mini games and boss battles and puzzles.

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yay, mini games and puzzles. Just what the DS needed.

285
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But it's zombies.

286
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And it's supposed to play out sort of comic book style.

287
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Well, that might be kind of cool.

288
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But it has the word thingy in it and that's great.

289
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Maybe instead of Mario Party we need Zombie Party.

290
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That might be kind of fun. Or Zombie Mario Party.

291
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
We need Romero Party.

292
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You know, I'm going to stop here right there with the whole zombie teenager thing.

293
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Ignition. What games have they put out?

294
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

295
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What, you mean they can't judge a game based on its title alone? What does this world come to?

296
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah, remember that other game, Monster Madness? How awesome that was?

297
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh wait, I'm sorry. It was not awesome. It was crap.

298
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We had zombies. You know what, we need a remake of Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I knew somehow we could not get through Zombie Stories without that game coming up.

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It was great.

301
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's what Monster Madness was sort of trying to be, but it sure as hell was not.

302
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It failed with a pH.

303
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Anyways, so moving on.

304
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Some interesting stuff. Of course, not a huge surprise, but there's going to be yet another Castlevania game on the DS.

305
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Big surprise there.

306
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Of course, producer Koji Igarashi said the first thing we're doing is another DS version.

307
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It hasn't been an official announcement, but we're doing it.

308
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And that, of course, wasn't in here.

309
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Well then that would be the official announcement.

310
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That was in an interview with Game Life.

311
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
They're going to be doing a new DS version.

312
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
More Castlevania? Or what do they call that? Metroidvania?

313
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Metroidvania.

314
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Metroidvania? That would be kind of fun.

315
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I made tonight's show roll, so I guess I'm okay in saying this and not spoiling anything,

316
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:38,000
is saying that I heard somewhere that they were actually thinking about for a 3D Castlevania,

317
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
kind of borrowing from Metroid again and doing a 3D Castlevania in the style of Metroid Prime.

318
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That could be very interesting, especially if it has the Wii controls,

319
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
because the Wii controls on Metroid Prime are kind of fun.

320
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So imagine how that could be.

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't want to do that. I think that whole whipping thing might be kind of lame,

322
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
but it might be interesting.

323
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Can you imagine Castlevania and the Metroid Prime 3 engine?

324
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It could be interesting.

325
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That would be fairly cool.

326
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't know yet. It's iffy, obviously.

327
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's a very iffy thing.

328
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's a very iffy thing.

329
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Well, last segment we were talking about Spore,

330
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
and of course a lot of folks are very excited about Spore and Will Wright.

331
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He's the man.

332
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But Will Wright made a pretty bold statement this week.

333
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He said that the Wii is the only next-gen console.

334
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He said in an interview, quote, somebody asked me what I thought Next Generation meant,

335
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and what about the PlayStation 3 was Next Generation.

336
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The only next-gen system I've seen is the Wii.

337
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 feel like better versions of the last,

338
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
but pretty much the same game with incremental improvement.

339
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That was in an interview with The Guardian Unlimited.

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It goes on to say, quote, not that the graphics are more powerful,

341
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
but that it hits a completely different demographic

342
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
in regards to how the Wii feels like a major jump.

343
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So coming from a major gaming mind,

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
a pretty bold statement there.

345
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's kind of interesting because a lot of people call Wii

346
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and Nintendo themselves call this the new generation.

347
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The Wii is going off over here in this direction,

348
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
whereas the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are doing a little bit more of the same but prettier.

349
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So it's very interesting that Will Wright steps in and says,

350
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
no, no, the Wii is the one that is really the next generation

351
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
because it's not doing the same old thing.

352
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Shut up, you people.

353
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Don't know anything. That's what I have to say about that.

354
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Make your damn games and be quiet.

355
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This is next generation.

356
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Listen, they're all fucking new consoles.

357
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
They're all next generation.

358
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Shut the hell up.

359
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's what I want to say.

360
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If I made a new 16-bit console,

361
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
that would still be another generation console

362
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
because it has come out in this generation of consoles.

363
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You know what? There is no next gen.

364
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
There's only current.

365
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Next gen is stuff that doesn't exist yet.

366
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I just like that you just told Will Wright to shut up.

367
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Fine. Seventh generation console, I guess,

368
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
because this is, I think, the seventh generation of consoles.

369
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Isn't technically for the PlayStation that would technically be third, wouldn't it?

370
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No, it's in the history of time.

371
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This is the seventh generation of consoles.

372
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Wikipedia ordered their generation.

373
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Are we chatting with Pong?

374
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
No, Wikipedia puts the Atari 2600 in the second generation of games

375
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
with, I believe, Coleco and some of the ones before it in the first generation.

376
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So then the first generation would then be like the Odyssey

377
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and the Fairchild Channel F?

378
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh, boy. Here we go.

379
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hold on. Here we go.

380
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I will pull up the article right now.

381
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Well, no.

382
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I just think that this whole classification is pretty retarded.

383
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm just tired of people commenting on what systems they think are next gen

384
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
and which systems are not.

385
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
They're all fucking whatever.

386
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It doesn't matter.

387
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Your comment makes, so you don't own a PS3, so you don't use your 360,

388
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't care.

389
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Make your damn game.

390
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Stop chit-chatting.

391
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
More worky on Spore.

392
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You know what?

393
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It doesn't matter.

394
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm actually bringing this up right now,

395
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and it's, yeah, they split this out into the different generations here,

396
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
and let's see if I can grab the wrap-up here real quick.

397
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
With the generations.

398
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Let's talk more rock.

399
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Sorry.

400
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay, yeah, the first generation of games would be from 72 to 77

401
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and includes the Magnavox Odyssey, Pong, and the Coleco Telstar.

402
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Okay.

403
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Are the games in the first generation.

404
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Then the second generation moves on to the Fairchild Channel F,

405
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
RCA Studio 2, Atari 2600, Valley Astrocade, the Odyssey,

406
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
the APF Imagination Machine, the Intellivision, the Atari 5200,

407
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Milton Bradley Vectrex, the Emerson Arcadia 2001,

408
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
ColecoVision, and the Sega SG1000 are all considered in the second generation.

409
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The Fairchild Channel F was ass.

410
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And then the video game crash of 1983 separates to the third generation,

411
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
which is the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Sega Master System,

412
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
and the Atari 7800.

413
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Then we get into the fourth generation of console games.

414
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
SNES.

415
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And the fourth generation of console games includes Turbografx-16,

416
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
the Sega Genesis, the Neo Geo, and the Super Nintendo.

417
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And I just closed it, so you'll just have to, you know, fifth generation.

418
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Speculate.

419
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I don't want to keep reading, but there you go.

420
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Well, hey, how about some other stuff?

421
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Sure.

422
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Pop'n Music Bee Mouse, the new Pop'n Music to be coming out.

423
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's themed after computer mice, so it's Bee Mouse.

424
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Well, it is a computer mouse.

425
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Wait, it is an actual mouse?

426
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yes, it is an actual mouse.

427
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Take a look at the picture.

428
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's awesome.

429
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It basically folds open, and there's buttons underneath it.

430
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That's bizarre.

431
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You really need to check it out.

432
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You can open up the mouse for nine buttons and play a Pop'n Music simulator with a CD.

433
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That's interesting.

434
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
That's very interesting.

435
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I've got the list of songs.

436
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
They have a really cool picture of it.

437
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's on Konami style.

438
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Definitely worth checking out.

439
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Anything worth noting?

440
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The song list, I mean.

441
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
There's actually some pretty cool stuff.

442
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Mr. T, Gradius Full Speed, is on there.

443
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Daikinkai by Desirou Gumi.

444
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Another lament theme.

445
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Shizuku by Asaki.

446
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:43,000
We have Megane Rock, Pop'n Music Wan, Giregire Meganidan, Sholakayo Ringoto.

447
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I can't see the text.

448
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It's so small.

449
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Hachimitsu, Aneta Magiska, Orchestra Featuring Maki.

450
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah, that's what it says.

451
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Lots of stuff.

452
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
There's Shining by Ryo and Noria.

453
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I think this actually is a mouse.

454
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You can actually use it on your computer.

455
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, it is.

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But if you take a look at this wonderful picture here, Rob, this is what it looks like.

457
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh, good, because I was actually bringing it up right now.

458
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Oh, that is weird.

459
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Huh.

460
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's kind of cool, though, I guess.

461
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah.

462
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So, it's a mouse, and then when you're ready to game, you can do it.

463
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
That's pretty cool.

464
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That's totally...

465
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm putting the link in the chatroom so they can see what it looks like.

466
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Nothing in 2DX mouse.

467
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
2DX mouse would not work, especially for people like me who are right-side players.

468
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But you could do it, though.

469
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
If you think about it, you could have a scroll wheel on the side of the mouse that would

470
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
be the scratch.

471
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah.

472
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That's kind of weird.

473
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Well, you know what they did for the...

474
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Or hell, just played 2DX with this.

475
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
For the WonderSwan?

476
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
For BeatMania on WonderSwan?

477
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
They had an add-on to it that you could attach a scratch pad onto the controller.

478
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
We should get 2DX DS.

479
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That would work.

480
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I think that that would work.

481
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I stand by what I said in part A about what they really need to do to innovate.

482
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Anyways.

483
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So other fun stuff, of course.

484
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
There's more firmwares coming out now for the PlayStation 3.

485
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
If you happen to purchase a copy of Ratchet & Clank Future, Tools of Destruction, you

486
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
got version 1.94, which didn't really do much.

487
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I think it added some support for the DualShock 3 for that game and then maybe some other

488
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
shit.

489
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
But that doesn't matter because apparently firmware 2.0 is supposed to be released on

490
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:45,000
October 30th and will feature some wonderful stuff including the ability to turn on and

491
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
off your PS3 using the PSP Remote Play.

492
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I don't see the purpose of that.

493
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:02,000
A new PlayStation Network category, TV category, who those of you who are in Europe who are

494
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
installing the Play TV onto your hard drive.

495
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:14,000
A new playlist for music and photo, a content group for video and game, and apparently there's

496
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,000
the cross-media bar customization including themes and background color settings.

497
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Sort of like what they have with the PSP right now.

498
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And then the Trend Micro Web Security for PS3 Internet Browser, which is a parental

499
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
lock for website viewing that will be free for a while and then eventually they will

500
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
charge you for it.

501
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Well Ratchet and Clank also has something else very interesting in it, not just a surprise

502
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
upgrade in anticipation of 2.0.

503
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of Destruction apparently will actually tie up to the upcoming

504
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
PSP game, Secret Agent Clank.

505
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And this was from a 1UP interview with Insomniac's Creative Director Brian Aligiere.

506
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And apparently he says that the PS3 game and the new PSP game will actually work and connect

507
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
to each other in quote, some secret undisclosed way.

508
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
And that's all we know.

509
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Unfortunately we don't know what it is.

510
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Like do you unlock some like old Ratchet and Clank game with it?

511
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Like a Metroid hookup type thing?

512
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Unfortunately we don't know.

513
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But we do know that the game will not connect up with other services.

514
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Tools of Destruction will not connect to home or any other PlayStation game or PSP game.

515
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Just the other Ratchet and Clank game that is coming out, Secret Agent Clank.

516
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
So look for it.

517
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'd be curious to know what that connectivity is.

518
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I hope it's something new and exciting and not something we've kind of seen before.

519
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Well, for anyone who is playing Motorstorm, there is a, looks like a patch to the game.

520
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah, that will actually, supposed to add vibration support for the DualShock 3 controller.

521
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Grid order randomized for the first race in any online lobby.

522
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Finishing positions for your last race to determine your starting grid position in the next race

523
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
within the same online lobby.

524
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Screen indicator is added to show whether voice comms are issuing from TV or headset.

525
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Sensitivity for 6-axis motion sensor.

526
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Gloating index, that's kind of weird.

527
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It gives you an idea of how well another racer is performed.

528
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I do like how it seems like quite a few Sony games are doing this.

529
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I like how these games kind of keep patching themselves to get a little better.

530
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I think that's kind of cool.

531
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I think I see that you kind of seem, it feels like I'm seeing that happen more on the Sony games than on 360 games.

532
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Usually the 360 games get patched to fix something that broke, not often to add completely new stuff.

533
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And that makes it feel a little more like, well, let's say World of Warcraft constantly patches itself,

534
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and a lot of MMOs do this, patch itself with brand new stuff.

535
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So, it's kind of interesting.

536
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Kind of nice.

537
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It makes you feel like you're getting a little more money for, you know, considering PS3 stuff is a lot of money.

538
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It makes you feel like, you know, you're getting a little more for your money.

539
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That's cool.

540
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Right?

541
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I mean, it's better than them releasing us download content and making us pay for it.

542
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Seriously.

543
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Of course, I wouldn't put that past you.

544
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't know.

545
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
If I remember back to playing Final Fantasy XI, I didn't particularly like downloading the updates.

546
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yeah, it kind of sucks when everybody was hitting it at once.

547
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But World of Warcraft does it kind of smart now.

548
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Right before a major patch will come out, a couple days or maybe even a week before,

549
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
they'll actually put a thing similar to BitTorrent that will automatically run when you launch WoW,

550
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
so it slowly downloads the patch as you're playing.

551
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And so that way when it's time for the patch to go live, then it'll send a pulse that says,

552
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
okay, time to update the game with the patch.

553
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And so everybody already has it downloaded.

554
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It's kind of cool.

555
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
That's pretty smart.

556
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I like the way they do it on WoW.

557
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And I want 2.3 already because I want my arena season one gear without having to work for it.

558
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Although I still kind of like how they do it in Ragnarok where they do small patches every time.

559
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And so it makes sure that your patches are all up to date right when you start the game.

560
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
That's kind of how Guild Wars worked too, wasn't it?

561
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
A little bit?

562
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I think so.

563
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's just little bits at a time.

564
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Yeah.

565
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Cool.

566
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Anyways, let's see here.

567
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Interesting news.

568
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well, I wouldn't exactly call this news because I've been talking about how stupid easy it's going to be

569
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
to copy the damn cards for Eye of Judgment.

570
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
But apparently it's even easier than you may have thought.

571
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
The game has absolutely no copy protection whatsoever.

572
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,000
In fact, you can pretty much draw symbols on a piece of paper using the felt tip marker and it will work.

573
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That's really sad.

574
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But yeah, it's very easy to copy them.

575
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The game has no problem reading, you know, printed out copies of the cards.

576
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Or just if you happen to scribble in the symbols that they have on the cards, it will work as well.

577
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So basically with a box of Crayolas, I could recreate the cards.

578
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yes.

579
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Wow.

580
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yes, you could.

581
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
That's kind of sad.

582
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It is sad.

583
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You know what?

584
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm just curious what the chat room has to say for this.

585
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I will remind...

586
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I've been having live stream problems.

587
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Dark Tetsuya is giving a big XD to Crayola.

588
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I will remind you though that in case you don't want to copy the cards, the theme packs are available for $15 each or $4 per booster pack.

589
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I swear I didn't use a Crayon reference on purpose.

590
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I swear.

591
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh my God.

592
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's funny.

593
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Anyhow, what's that?

594
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh, the fake cards?

595
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah.

596
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Anyhow, you know, this means we got lied to about the whole copy protection thing and I don't like getting lied to.

597
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
We all knew this was coming.

598
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
We all knew this was going to happen and this makes us very angsty.

599
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So you know we have to bring on the FUs of the week.

600
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:13,000
And back by popular demand, folks.

601
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
FU to this music?

602
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'm fucking sick of it.

603
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Done.

604
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Sorry, we got emails.

605
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
They missed it.

606
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Don't care.

607
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Don't care.

608
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Don't care.

609
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
We'll see.

610
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
FU to women for not being able to make up their mind on certain things.

611
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
For example, say for, you know, you're asking your wife what they want to eat for dinner.

612
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And they're like, I don't know.

613
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So you start suggesting things.

614
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And they're like, no, I don't want to do that.

615
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
No, I don't want to do that.

616
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
We'll fucking suggest something then if you're just going to deny every one of my suggestions and fucking come up with your own.

617
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I hate it.

618
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And it's not about everything.

619
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Women do this about all sorts of categories.

620
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm going to give you a hint.

621
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Just do whatever you want.

622
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I do.

623
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And they complain.

624
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So there's no winning that argument.

625
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That's it.

626
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
All right.

627
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,000
My FU of the week goes to my injury because it sucks.

628
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And I don't like having a sore thigh thing.

629
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It makes it hard to sit down.

630
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
People go, you can't sit down.

631
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Being injured sucks.

632
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I had a real FU, actually.

633
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Oh, yes.

634
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
What is that?

635
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
This stupid music pushed it out of my head.

636
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't even know if I have the other music queued up.

637
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Hold on.

638
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Let's see if we can do shuffling, shuffling, shuffling.

639
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
This is wonderful.

640
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Radio us.

641
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I dig through the computer.

642
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Don't worry about it.

643
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Hold on.

644
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

645
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm in the right folder.

646
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I just need the right file name.

647
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And here we go.

648
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Much better.

649
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Anyway.

650
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So my actual FU goes towards, I don't really want to say towards my husband because I really,

651
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
really, really do love my husband.

652
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But he can be freaking infuriating sometimes.

653
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And I know that he has good intentions, but don't try to have a logical discussion with

654
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
me when I haven't eaten anything in like 12 hours.

655
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It doesn't work.

656
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And don't be pushy about it either.

657
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
The end.

658
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
All right.

659
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Sorry, I was putting away the webcam because our Op11 time ran up.

660
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Why are people pushy?

661
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I don't know.

662
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
You shouldn't be pushy.

663
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You should be pulley.

664
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
All right.

665
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Let's get back into some gaming news because then we'll be pushing the listeners to call

666
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
in on our Skype line.

667
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Oh, God.

668
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

669
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Our username on Skype.

670
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
We have a few more stories, a handful of stories for you guys before we get there.

671
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And the first one has to do with GameStop.

672
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
GameStop, they have EB, and it seems like they're taking over the world when it comes

673
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
to mall video game stores.

674
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And they just might be because they just opened up.

675
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
This place isn't that far from us, actually.

676
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Jackson, California.

677
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That's not that far from here.

678
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Just probably about 30 miles from here.

679
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
They opened up their 5,000th store, GameStop did.

680
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
The 5,000th GameStop store.

681
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
What GameStop?

682
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Well, to put that in perspective, and a lot of people feel that way, which is why this

683
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
news may be good news for some and bad news for others.

684
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
To put it in perspective, Starbucks has 12,000 plus locations, but I wonder if that counts

685
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
like the ones in the grocery store.

686
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I don't know.

687
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
And McDonald's, get this, has 31,000 restaurants.

688
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But still, to think that for every six McDonald's there's one GameStop, I mean, there's a lot

689
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
of freaking McDonald's, right?

690
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Like every exit on the freeway has a McDonald's, right?

691
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So, kind of interesting that for every six of those there's still one GameStop.

692
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Interesting.

693
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Very interesting.

694
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Well, you know what else is interesting is that people are still making Dreamcast games.

695
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
And the rest of the world goes, why?

696
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
But I love the Dreamcast.

697
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
The Dreamcast is like the best system ever.

698
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So Dark Sakura says, because.

699
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Yep.

700
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Except, why this retarded game?

701
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,560
The Alice Company is bringing out Dynamite Dreams, which is pretty much a Bomberman ripoff

702
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,000
that was based off of a minigame in Alice Dreams that they were working on.

703
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So, whatever.

704
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Bring me a good game, please.

705
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'll work on doing that right now.

706
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The Dreamcast was so awesome.

707
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Anyways, it's a little bit of fun here.

708
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Well, I don't know if this is fun, but the place where every website goes, or where the

709
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,500
internet goes to die, is now going to be the place where games go to die, because MySpace

710
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,800
is launching their casual games channel in 2008.

711
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,120
And you'll be able to put crappy Flash games into your web page.

712
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,320
So I can destroy my profile with all those buildings.

713
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,320
Some people do that already.

714
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,960
I think people on MySpace have seen it.

715
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,000
I think a coworker of mine has Pac-Man on their profile, like a little mini Pac-Man

716
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
game.

717
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's not real Pac-Man.

718
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,360
It's some cheap knockoff, but oh boy.

719
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,200
Could that be interesting, though, if they had leaderboards all tied together and you

720
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,840
could see how you compare on these casual games to your friends?

721
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,000
I mean, a little silly fun.

722
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,880
This actually might not be such a bad thing if done right, but I don't know.

723
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,960
I fear that if you let users put these on their profiles, it's just going to make bad

724
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,800
profiles even uglier.

725
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Yeah.

726
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,000
But at least on MySpace, if your profile is ugly, it's your own damn fault, right?

727
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,940
I had somebody make mine, but mine was pretty.

728
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,680
You still had the final approval, and you looked at it and you go, yeah.

729
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
Like seriously, I look at some of...

730
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,320
I helped design the graphics on it, too.

731
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,720
Well, I look at some of my friends' MySpaces and I go, do you even look at your own page?

732
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,880
Like it's hideous.

733
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,480
You have to scroll down forever to see anything.

734
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,000
Like who's actually going to look at this?

735
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,680
I actually scaled my MySpace page back a little while ago, A, so I can make it public, and

736
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,720
B, because it's public again, and B, so I could, you know, just not have to scroll so

737
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,240
much because of all the stupid pictures I had on it.

738
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,840
BlackLavinarChatroom says, MySpace is garbage, but don't you have a MySpace?

739
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,840
Hm.

740
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,200
GS68 says, you do not say the MS word.

741
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
Microsoft?

742
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Oh, MySpace.

743
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Someone left a...

744
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,920
I was just checking my MySpace now to see what was on it, and Neki left the best joke

745
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,920
ever.

746
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,920
What's that?

747
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,560
What do people go that's bigger on the inside than the out, and it's their retardus?

748
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
What?

749
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
That's awful.

750
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Oh, retardus.

751
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,560
I get it.

752
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
Wow.

753
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,560
Bad Dr. Who joke.

754
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,560
That is a very bad joke in many different color forms.

755
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,560
But it made me laugh.

756
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
All right.

757
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,760
Anyhow, maybe our listeners want to tell some jokes tonight.

758
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,680
We're going to take some calls right now, www.OrangeLarmsRadio.com, click on interact

759
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,400
with us for all the details, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number if you want to pick up the phone

760
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
and call.

761
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,520
Have your mommy or daddy's permission because it's only toll free in the US and Canada.

762
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,680
Or you can call us on Skype.

763
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
That's free for everyone.

764
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,520
Our username is Orange Lounge Radio.

765
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,960
Looking at some other quick comments on chat while we wait for some calls because of the

766
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
delay.

767
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,700
Escapist in our chat room says, in regards to Facebook, here we go again with the MySpace

768
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,040
versus Facebook thing, just try to lick me in real life.

769
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,680
I dare you.

770
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,720
I'm sure that's from one of those, you just got a lick, or you just got poked by so and

771
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
so.

772
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,960
I don't want to go back to my annoyance with Facebook.

773
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,440
I actually tried to add, I went back and added some friends because some OLR people added

774
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
me on Facebook.

775
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,600
I guess amongst all my rants on the show recently, folks figured out I had an account.

776
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,760
So all right, let's head on over to the phones and we'll take a call.

777
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,120
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

778
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,120
It's Legend of Zaku.

779
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,560
Hello, Legend of Zaku.

780
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
What's on your mind?

781
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:23,960
Nah, just going through the usual Sunday routine, just getting playing Crysis and stuff like

782
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,160
that demo.

783
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
Listening to our show.

784
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,640
Are you doing both at the same time?

785
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,120
Well, if I could, now that I have a new PC to do it on.

786
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,120
Nice.

787
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,120
So what's on your mind?

788
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
What do you want to tell us about?

789
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,840
I don't know, the fact that Crysis is just, you know, it's not for the faint of heart,

790
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,360
graphics-wise and system-wise.

791
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:49,840
Obviously, you're going to need a really beefy PC to get through it.

792
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
But also, I think...

793
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,840
But is it a good game?

794
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
Huh?

795
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,140
Is it a good game?

796
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,140
So far it is.

797
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:01,160
I mean, it's kind of like Half-Life 2 and Far Cry had a love child.

798
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
Okay.

799
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
All right.

800
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:11,960
I mean, yeah, so far it's running pretty good for a new system that I built so far.

801
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,120
But you know, hopefully when it launches, it'll probably be optimized and ready for

802
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
use.

803
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:22,960
It was a little laggy from what I hear from other folks with other more powerful systems

804
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,960
than mine.

805
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960
All right.

806
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Very cool.

807
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Mm-hmm.

808
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,480
Well, anything else you've been playing lately besides Crysis?

809
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,360
Just Quake Wars, another game that came with my video card, Enemy Territory Quake Wars.

810
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
And how's that?

811
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
It's all right.

812
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,040
I mean, it's kind of like Battlefield and the Quake Wars world.

813
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,880
You mean the Quake world?

814
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,880
Quake we own.

815
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,880
Quake needs...

816
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,480
You know, because Quake 4 wasn't all that great.

817
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,840
So Quake needs some good games that make me remember how much the first game was awesome.

818
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,560
We need Enemy Territory Duke Nukem.

819
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,560
That's what we need.

820
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,760
Maybe after Duke Nukem Forever.

821
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,400
Wasn't that supposed to come out at the end of the year?

822
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Oh, fucking hell.

823
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,840
Wasn't one of those, hey, it finally got a release date and it's like...

824
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,240
No, it never got a release date.

825
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,520
That'd be all over the internet, Vann.

826
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,680
Yes, that's true.

827
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:17,520
And also, I think I heard of another Xbox Live horror story where this one guy, he got,

828
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,240
you know, he sent his console to get it repaired.

829
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,800
And then when he got the new one back, they couldn't even transfer like, you know, $320

830
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,960
worth of Microsoft points because they're not transferable.

831
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,160
Right.

832
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,760
Can't you call Microsoft and get that fixed?

833
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,880
No, that's a, that's a, that's apparently, unfortunately that's a policy that they have.

834
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Well, here's the thing.

835
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,120
You don't need to transfer the points because that's, your live account is on their server.

836
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
It's not on the 360.

837
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,800
All you got to do is re...

838
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,880
They told him was that the points were actually tied to the console.

839
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,380
No, they're not.

840
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,800
It's from what I recall, it's a little bit of both is that you download the game and

841
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
that's tied to your account.

842
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,480
But here's the thing, like, let's say, like, let's say me and you are playing, let's say

843
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,240
we're roommates again, Loki, back in the day and we have one 360 in the house.

844
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,320
If I paid for the game and I downloaded it, you get to play the full version on the console.

845
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,900
But here's the thing.

846
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:20,600
If we get a new console or whatever and I sign in and download the game, you can't play

847
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
it.

848
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,960
You still get the trial version.

849
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,120
Okay.

850
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,880
That's still, that doesn't matter though.

851
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,480
That's the thing is that his games that he purchased should be able to be transferred

852
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,400
over because he can just redownload them again and he still has the full rights to

853
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,880
them because it has, you know, on record that he's paid for it and also if he has any Microsoft

854
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,660
points because you can purchase those points through like independent websites and stuff

855
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,660
and add them on there.

856
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,540
Like for example, if you're buying stuff for your Zune, your Microsoft account or whatever

857
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,120
still tied to all that stuff.

858
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,840
So you can port it over even if you buy a new 360.

859
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,000
They have the ability to do that.

860
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I've done that.

861
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I have a story right now.

862
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I don't know where.

863
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I know I saw it on.

864
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,760
Well, that's the story and you stick into it.

865
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
All right.

866
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,240
Well, Zach, we got to let you go to get some more calls real quick.

867
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,240
Last final thought for everybody.

868
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:17,680
Um, just, um, I don't know, just, you know, you know, just get a better computer.

869
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,680
All right.

870
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Get it.

871
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,680
You might need one.

872
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,680
Everybody get a better computer.

873
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,680
All right.

874
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,680
Thanks Zach.

875
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,680
You have a good one, buddy.

876
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,680
All right.

877
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,680
Good.

878
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,680
Bye bye.

879
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,680
Did you hear that?

880
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,680
Everybody, you need to get a better computer.

881
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,680
Loki, get a better computer.

882
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,400
I did need a computer.

883
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,920
My computer, the hard drive or something's crapping out on it.

884
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,520
I actually want to get this fucking fan on this thing is so I wonder if I could like

885
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,520
hold the microphone.

886
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,360
You could hear it.

887
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,840
The fan on this thing is so loud.

888
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,480
You can hear it throughout the whole house.

889
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,480
It's crazy.

890
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,480
Hi.

891
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,480
You're on orange launch radio.

892
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,480
Who's this?

893
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,480
Hi.

894
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,200
You're on orange launch radio.

895
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,200
Who's this?

896
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,600
This would be the dark knight himself.

897
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,600
There you are, sir.

898
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,920
You're a little bit quiet, but that's all right.

899
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,060
We'll fix that.

900
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,060
How are you doing?

901
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,920
How are you doing, dark knight?

902
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,920
Yeah.

903
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,920
How you doing?

904
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,920
Good.

905
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,920
How are you?

906
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,920
A little bit happier now that I have my 360.

907
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,240
I noticed that you've actually been signing into live.

908
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,520
I was playing Guitar Hero 3 earlier today and I saw you sign on and I was kind of like,

909
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,520
wait a minute.

910
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,800
I thought he only had an Xbox.com account, but not a live, so now you're actually on

911
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,120
Xbox Live and all that.

912
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:26,120
Yeah.

913
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,120
Yeah.

914
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,040
So, what kind of games have you been playing?

915
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,120
Forza 2 and Man of 97, Man of 07, I'm sorry.

916
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,880
But yeah, if you were playing Man of 97 on Xbox, that would be something, though.

917
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,160
That means you had to cram that cartridge into some slot.

918
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,000
Xbox Live Arcade or something like that.

919
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Very cool.

920
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So, what's it like being all brand new to the Xbox now?

921
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,080
I mean, does it seem like there's a lot out there the Xbox has to offer?

922
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,440
I guess let me back up and rephrase it this way.

923
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,680
What made you finally decide to take the plunge after all this time and jump in and get a

924
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,680
360?

925
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,360
Part of it is because I didn't want to fall behind.

926
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:09,280
The other part was that since I do my own show, I want to kind of keep up to date with

927
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,560
it and everything like that.

928
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,880
That's understandable.

929
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,680
Sometimes I buy games just so I can talk about them here or what have you.

930
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,200
It's probably kind of dangerous, but I like to be informed, so shoot me.

931
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,240
Okay, so that's cool to see you finally took the plunge.

932
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,320
For the betterment of your own program as well as the internet.

933
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,440
For the greater good.

934
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,440
That's right.

935
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,440
Of all mankind.

936
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,440
Yes.

937
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
That's very cool.

938
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,040
It's kind of funny though because everybody talked about you should play it on high definition

939
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,040
TV and whatnot.

940
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:48,040
I admit I don't have one, but in due fairness, it looks just as good on a regular TV.

941
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,640
That's an excellent point is that sometimes we talk about all these graphics and the HD

942
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,440
TVs and everything and we forget, you know what, not everybody can just afford to run

943
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,700
out and go buy an HD TV.

944
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,920
They're still kind of pricey.

945
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,200
Do you think amongst your gaming experience, does Microsoft do a pretty good job of still

946
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,840
keeping the love for the folks that are stuck with standard definition for now?

947
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,400
Yeah, I mean, it's not really that bad at all.

948
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,240
Like I said, I'm playing Madden 07 and it looks just as good as on HD.

949
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,360
The only difference is I don't have that total clearness and HD would have it, but it does

950
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,320
do it justice.

951
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:27,560
Do most of the standard definitions games letterbox?

952
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:36,680
No, because basically it picks it up as a 480p TV.

953
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,480
Some games letterbox themselves though, right?

954
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,640
Didn't Final Fantasy XI automatically letterbox even if you were on a standard TV?

955
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:47,000
Well, it depends on the game because you have to set your console to, you can set it so

956
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,480
that your TV is a 4 by 3 aspect ratio and then if the game wants to letterbox it will,

957
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,360
otherwise it may just do full screen.

958
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:08,320
Well, Dark Knight, what would you say you're looking forward to most on the 360 now that

959
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,560
you're an owner?

960
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,640
Just messing around with it right now and just getting used to it.

961
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:24,080
So far I've downloaded some Xbox Live games and whatnot, I've downloaded Final Fantasy

962
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,360
Special and whatnot.

963
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,760
I can't get my words out tonight.

964
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,760
Very cool.

965
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,760
No, that's alright.

966
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,440
If you think about it, they're almost up to 100 of those games pretty soon.

967
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,620
For those of us who have been on Xbox Live a while, it seems like alright, we just kind

968
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,840
of wait for each week to see what they're going to release to see if it's worth buying.

969
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,040
But man, to be jumping in on that now and then you dip into the archive like, oh my

970
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,120
God, there's like 100 games to pick from, tons of stuff.

971
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,120
Exactly.

972
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
That's got to be crazy.

973
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,120
That's what my reaction was when I saw it.

974
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
I was like, dude, that's a long list.

975
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,120
Yeah, it keeps growing.

976
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,120
Sometimes the rest of us take it for granted.

977
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,200
Well, Dark Knight, we have to let you go so we can get to some more calls, but thank you

978
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,440
very much and enjoy the Xbox.

979
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,440
I hope your Xbox experiences Red Rings of Death free.

980
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:09,640
Well, lo and behold, my system is like a late system.

981
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,240
I think it was dated July 22nd of 07, so it's recent.

982
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,240
Oh, good.

983
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,240
Good.

984
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,240
Then I hope it's Red Rings free.

985
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,240
Alright.

986
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,240
We'll be pulling for you, buddy.

987
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,240
Alright.

988
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,240
You have a good one.

989
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,240
See you.

990
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,240
You too.

991
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,240
Bye.

992
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,240
Bye.

993
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,240
Bye.

994
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,640
If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

995
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,640
Let's see if we can squeeze in some out.

996
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,640
We're already getting a call.

997
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,640
Here we go.

998
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,640
Hi.

999
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,640
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1000
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:35,640
Who's this?

1001
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,640
Yo, it's Xenocore.

1002
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,640
How y'all doing?

1003
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,640
Good.

1004
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,640
How are you, Xenocore?

1005
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,640
Yeah, I'm living.

1006
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,640
I'm living.

1007
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,640
You know how things go.

1008
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,640
How are we?

1009
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,080
Even with minor injuries and whatever else is going on in our personal lives, we're making

1010
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,120
it to another week.

1011
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,580
What's on your mind?

1012
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,200
Not too much.

1013
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,480
Just heard you guys referencing some of the old school stuff that I call in.

1014
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,980
Dark Soccer was talking about Ragnarok II.

1015
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:05,880
I touched something that looks like it was made in the same engine called Pirate King

1016
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:06,880
Online.

1017
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,420
It looks like it's done in the Ragnarok.

1018
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,420
In the Ragnarok.

1019
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:10,420
It's too damn cute.

1020
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,240
I couldn't play it for more than an hour.

1021
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,240
play pirate king online

1022
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,200
It was all right

1023
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,200
Yeah, I got that feeling. I'm gonna farm that off the farm that off the show. I couldn't review it well

1024
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,560
Where did you know what he's a weird like echoing with you? I don't know what that is

1025
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,360
I just want to let those people who's listening on their iPods and stuff know if you're hearing him repeat things

1026
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:35,940
That's not that's not you guys. It's it's some something weird with the call actually it is you guys you just

1027
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,560
Can't hear correctly. I don't know what that is. That's an error

1028
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:45,200
I've not seen before but anyway, so so pirate king was okay was Ragnarok is a ton more fun. Okay?

1029
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,920
That one and

1030
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,500
All different odds and ends here and there managed to get some more points on ER kung fu and Xbox Live

1031
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:00,960
But that's pretty much the only noteworthy thing. I've been doing lately. So hey yar kung fu is a pretty fun little game

1032
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,960
It's it's often overlooked

1033
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:07,440
But you know because you know fighting games have evolved so damn much since then but you know

1034
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,200
You gotta respect the elders too. I know you play a lot of RPGs

1035
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:15,220
What other kind of like obscure MMOs maybe because you know, everybody always talks about your Warcraft Warcraft Warcraft

1036
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,200
What are the types of MMOs and and just maybe other role-playing games in general?

1037
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,840
Should we be looking out for that? Maybe the mainstream media doesn't pay enough attention to

1038
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,680
Well, there is one free one. I reviewed in the past called Bounty Bay online

1039
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,400
That really looks good and it is free at the moment. Nice

1040
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:37,000
It's a pirate simulator. It plays like pirates does but it's an MMO environment

1041
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,040
So it's pretty neat. Wow. We really do have a lot of pirates MMOs cuz then Disney put out an official one

1042
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,280
I'm thinking well, of course, uh, there's but there's puzzle pirates, too

1043
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,800
And it's kind of all probably thanks to Johnny Depp, but I don't know you'd like to think probably yes

1044
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,860
I'm gonna do that. But where are my ninja MMOs? That's the ultimate question. We have all these pirate MMOs

1045
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:01,380
Where is my ninja MMO whether it be Ninja Gaiden or last ninja? I don't know just a ninja MMO

1046
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,200
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Damn. Skippy, man

1047
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,520
We need to take our idea and patent it. There it is

1048
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:13,360
I I now own the patents and trademarks on a ninja MMO watch me get see somebody probably made one

1049
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,360
I just don't know of it. So

1050
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,940
Well seen according to these guys anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1051
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:24,480
That's pretty much it. Yeah, I'm still waiting for rock band and guitar hero 3 to come out

1052
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:30,400
We'll see how they do upon release guitar instruments guitar hero 3 was out yesterday. Oh, yeah, that's true

1053
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,520
That's true. But rock bands the one I'm looking for, but I'm waiting for the for the peripherals to start coming by themselves

1054
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,120
I don't have that many homies around me to buy the whole set

1055
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:42,400
Yeah, that's too much money for the whole set and unfortunately the peripherals by themselves

1056
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,080
You're gonna be going into oh wait

1057
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,480
But I'm probably gonna pick up the game because I have the guitar hero 2 controller which will work with rock band

1058
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,660
So at least I'll have guitar and you know, if if my microphone works for Xbox Live

1059
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:58,300
They'll have a microphone if it doesn't that it doesn't I didn't nobody on Xbox Live music or buying anyway

1060
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,020
They don't need to hear me sing. I'm buying you're gonna buy the whole bundle. Yeah sucker

1061
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:06,360
I know cuz I hate playing guitar here and I don't know why the fuck I keep buying this shit

1062
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,360
I'm getting the bundle because

1063
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:13,000
You guys are made of money. All right, I'm not made of money. It's worth it. If you're gonna get anything

1064
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:22,700
I've cut down on my buying of 360 games, so I don't really worry about you know, I'm saving up. All right

1065
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,580
You can buy you can spend your money. However, you want. I'm just saying 170 bucks. That's a lot of money

1066
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,580
Oh, that's a lot of not

1067
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:37,860
Really? Cuz I mean if if I don't you know go out for lunch during my work week then after you know

1068
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:42,600
A few weeks that's enough to pay for the game. Hmm. Then again next month is gonna be slim for me anyway

1069
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,540
All right

1070
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:49,340
Well Zina court we got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but any of any other quick last comments

1071
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:55,060
Yeah, that's pretty much it guys. I'll talk to you guys later. All right. Take care Zina court. Bye. Bye

1072
00:54:55,060 --> 00:55:00,820
I think it's the first time he's been on the program. Actually, I don't remember him calling him before maybe he did once

1073
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,960
But appreciate always hearing from the people we don't often hear from but we also

1074
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:10,540
Appreciate hearing from the people we do often hear from which I believe is our next call. Hello. You're on Orange launch radio

1075
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,460
Hey, it's run. What's up, everyone? What I tell ya. Hi everyone

1076
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,540
No, I just said because the last caller was someone we don't hear from a lot

1077
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,860
But now we're hearing from someone we do hear from a lot, but that's alright. What's up?

1078
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:27,980
Not much not much. Oh and sky. I know you're pro ninja

1079
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,900
I'm only try to send you a ninjas versus pirate shirt where ninjas win four to three. All right

1080
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,900
Sounds yes

1081
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:41,300
Definitely, but I don't hate pirates like usually, you know in the ninja versus pirate or you have to love one and hate the others

1082
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:47,040
I don't hate pirates. I respect pirates, but they're just you know, they're just inferior to ninjas

1083
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:53,260
Plus ninjas are cooler. That's right. Yeah. Anyway, sorry. Yeah, what'd you want to call us talk about tonight?

1084
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:58,140
Surely it wasn't pirates versus ninjas. Oh, no, I got a couple of game reviews for you. What games?

1085
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:04,300
Puzzle quest for the DS and the Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass. All right, let's start with puzzle quest for the DS

1086
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,300
Cuz it's the older game. What do you think?

1087
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:12,300
Honestly, I should have waited till the game dropped to 1999. Oh snap. Not a big fan, huh?

1088
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:18,260
Yeah, I am a big fan of bejeweled and a friend of mine bought it and I not really know too much about it

1089
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,820
She said it's just like bejeweled

1090
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:23,460
I'm like, really went out like a couple of weeks later and I bought it

1091
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:29,900
I mean, I like the puzzle aspect the puzzle RPG element of it, but it's just that when you're looking at the game

1092
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,940
It's like you're not sure where to begin. Do you want to build up your gold?

1093
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,260
Do you want to start fighting the creature build up your experience?

1094
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:42,220
And you just gotta be very careful in the patterns that you move because you make the wrong move

1095
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:47,500
That your applause gonna hit like a five six chain combo then you're like rarely screwed

1096
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,380
That's kind of what I like about it though, because it isn't bejeweled. I mean it isn't it isn't

1097
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:58,740
I mean just adding that one small little change really kind of changes the whole the whole way you think about the game

1098
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,740
Well, you don't want to set up really elaborate combos and bejeweled

1099
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,940
It's all about let me make a move that will set up my next move to be really cool

1100
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,280
But now in puzzle quest you got to go what's a cool move I can do right now

1101
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:17,140
That's not gonna screw me in the next turn. I know I mean like each battle takes me about 10 to 15 minutes

1102
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:21,980
I'm sitting here like scrutinizing the board if I do this, I start do that. I'll see myself doing

1103
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:25,740
Two three moves in advance what's gonna happen if I do this if I do that?

1104
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,180
I don't know my wife's not having trouble beating the game

1105
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,840
Well, your wife has a super brain or something. No, I don't know

1106
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,740
It's a different way of thinking about it. No, I almost got a few words for you Loki. Okay, I

1107
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,140
Got I got there's a lot of people I know that have beat the game

1108
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:45,140
But it just it's a different way of thinking about it. You can't play it like you're playing bejeweled because you'll be screwed

1109
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,460
So yeah, pretty much it's all about the skulls

1110
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,160
You have to look at the screen and make sure there's no

1111
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:55,180
Skulls that you can line up first because if you don't get it, I swear to God the computer will every time

1112
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,380
I know they're ruthless, but that's that's challenge

1113
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,180
Yeah, I love unlocking stuff in the game

1114
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,820
I mean if I could just sit there and do those puzzles like all day just kills like

1115
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,580
Like my entire time on the train going to work

1116
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:11,380
No, so maybe this game is worth a little more than giving it credit for it

1117
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,380
But what so what don't you like about the game?

1118
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,280
I love that really gets on me is the music

1119
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,080
I mean yes supposed to be a medieval style

1120
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:22,520
But the music can be so low that I find myself almost passing out going to sleep

1121
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,840
I'll get that music's a little generic in the game. It's nothing too special

1122
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,760
Alright, well tell us a little more about the other game. So you're gonna be what is a fan of hourglass?

1123
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,400
Fan of hourglass. Ah, what about so good is it?

1124
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,720
Yes, I mean I'm playing it

1125
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,200
I'm like

1126
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,800
This is so much like a link to the past to me the way I'm the way to have it set up

1127
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,800
And this is what it reminds me so much of

1128
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,680
Honestly, I didn't even know you controlled link with the stylus up what the game and I'm like

1129
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:55,520
I don't know if I'm gonna like this but ten minutes in I'm like, okay, I could definitely rock this this this is it

1130
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,000
This is fun

1131
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,560
Interesting. I see I'm still not sure I feel about it. I'm gonna try and borrow it for my friend

1132
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,280
Because I'm starting to get poor from all these games

1133
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,880
I'm buying so I definitely want to try and borrow it from somewhere of it. That's kind of cool

1134
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,640
Hmm, so I mean, how does it compare to other handheld Zelda games?

1135
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:18,760
I mean does that does the whole stylus element just really change things for the better for the worst or just you know

1136
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,760
The new gen or whatever you want to call it. I

1137
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,440
Think it makes things for the better though. I mean because the last

1138
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,560
Bunch of portable Zelda games. What do we have like Oracle of Ages Oracle of Seasons a link to the past the port of that

1139
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,560
You know

1140
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:40,400
But none of those were bad games. Yeah, but they were just kind of the Super Nintendo games on in handheld form

1141
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,480
Yeah, definitely. Oh, could you look one second? Hold on? Did we just get it? Oh, no, no

1142
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,480
No, I'm my roommates playing Guitar Hero 3 and I think he's on the very last song. Oh my gosh

1143
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:58,080
Yeah, how funny. Oh, yeah, that's pretty hardcore. You gotta be playing that game a lot to get that far

1144
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:03,960
All right, Rama any other quick thoughts? We gotta let you go to try take one more call before we sign off about

1145
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,520
Loki's tingle costume. Yes, he'll green or bright green

1146
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,060
Are you gonna make him a costume? I know people that will do it

1147
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,520
You got don't get don't put the cart before the horse

1148
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,680
The game has to sell million copies and sell million copies

1149
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,220
But it when it does because I get the fabric for cheap by the way, it's a win-win situation

1150
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:29,740
I'm pretty sure it's a darker green very similar to what link wears, but when it the game sells you a million copies

1151
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:35,020
We'll send you Loki's measurements. It's not gonna sell million copies. It's told that would be

1152
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:37,420
extremely

1153
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:40,800
Extremely unlikely you have to admit what a hilarious Christmas gift. That would be

1154
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:45,340
Well, it wouldn't be Christmas since six months from now

1155
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:51,220
All right, Rama we got we gotta let you go. But thanks so much for calling in. All right, take care

1156
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:56,620
It would be a fun six-year anniversary gift because over the show

1157
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:57,140
Yeah

1158
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,700
Because that it's approximately six months idea

1159
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:04,820
I have to do dark soccer and I might have to go to Hancock fabrics or whatever fabric stores are out there go get some

1160
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:08,420
Fabric go to LA. So just go to New York and meet up with Rama's friends

1161
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:12,100
I think this is gonna be last call tonight folks. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns radio. Who's this?

1162
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,180
It's puppy

1163
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:19,860
What are you so what's on your mind? Why aren't you in studio tonight? We have a fourth mic now. Oh

1164
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:26,060
You do. Well, well, I have a guitar here with me and that's what I've been busy with today fair enough fair enough

1165
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,060
Well, how is the game? How you enjoying it? I?

1166
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,180
Like it a lot. I'm a little bit

1167
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,100
peed off at the amount of selling out that

1168
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:38,940
Activision did with the game because I got by the time I got to the third set of songs

1169
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:42,260
I had already seen like four new companies advertising in the game

1170
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:48,060
Really? How did they advertise the companies in the game? Because maybe I'm just oblivious. I'm like totally missed it

1171
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:53,040
Well, I live in the Guitar Center stuff for a store that I didn't notice that

1172
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,140
too

1173
01:01:55,140 --> 01:02:01,820
It seemed I thought there was acts doing some stuff. They have acts guitar patterns and

1174
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:07,860
These acts girls that come out and dance during some of those encore stages Wow

1175
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:14,420
And then Pontiac came out and the whole there's one whole stage where it's just like the Pontiac garage

1176
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:19,420
Like from Jimmy Kimmel live or whatever it is because it's supposed to be some sort of fancy music video set

1177
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:24,340
Interesting and Pontiac car comes and runs you over and that's hilarious

1178
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,020
But but at the same time I look at this and go, okay

1179
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:32,020
Would I rather we have the Pontiac stage of Guitar Hero or the Yaris game?

1180
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:36,940
You know here here's what one thing I've heard that they forgot to mention about Guitar Hero

1181
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:42,660
That's really fucking awesome the intro and the fucking cutscenes that are in this game are the cartoons

1182
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:44,660
Yeah, there's the car so cool

1183
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:49,540
Why don't they just do Guitar Hero cartoon series every fucking cooler than the game?

1184
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:59,300
Loki feels very strongly about his dislike of Guitar Hero over here. Well, hey, they've already done that before it was called

1185
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:06,760
Legend of Black Heaven and it was an anime thing about this this like middle-aged guy who becomes a rocker again and fights aliens

1186
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,860
It's awesome cartoons the cutscenes made me think of what the hell's metal op. What's that show on Cartoon Network?

1187
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:18,500
It's a metalocalypse. Thank you. That's that's that's what the cartoon things made me think of and I don't watch the show a whole lot

1188
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:25,300
But anyway, I'm sorry about because I would be funny. Yeah, so what did you we made you talk about Guitar Hero?

1189
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,300
What did you actually want to call in talk about tonight?

1190
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,100
Well

1191
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:37,240
Other than Guitar Hero. Yeah, that's what I've been spending most of my time on but I just was wondering that also

1192
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:42,720
but you know with all the you were mentioned earlier about the halo 3 downloading videos and

1193
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,440
Game views and stuff like that

1194
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:50,840
He was wearing food actually seeing a bunch of the stuff that they that had been coming out recently with all the all the funny

1195
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:56,000
Little clips of like people getting killed by cones and shooting themselves in the head with sniper rifles

1196
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:56,480
No

1197
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:01,720
But you need to send me some of the best ones and I will simply because like I've been playing so many other games like

1198
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:06,240
It was his halo because now we're getting into that, you know gaming barrage or like it seems like every week

1199
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,200
I'm playing a new game. I want to play and then next year

1200
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,400
I'm gonna go back and catch up on everything

1201
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:14,720
So at some point I will have to go I get that but I love I love like taking the pictures and putting them online

1202
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:20,040
I mean forget looking at other people's stuff. I like playing with my own stuff that I create is fun

1203
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:25,800
But to be honest, I haven't touched halo 3 in about a week at least so I I need to look up some of this

1204
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,100
Funny stuff. So please please send me some fun

1205
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:33,980
Oh, yeah a bunch of a bunch of the stuff is actually on YouTube that some of the more popular stuff and it's all free

1206
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,500
advertising for halo 3 all free advertising. Oh

1207
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,340
Yeah, definitely

1208
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:44,140
I want to say this real quick going to the chat room some comments Sephiroth1215 says

1209
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:50,020
Actually, the game should be cheaper because of ads speaking about guitar hero ads but Activision is too damn greedy

1210
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:57,460
So they make a music game $60 seriously. That's way too much for a game that didn't cost that much in development. Ouch

1211
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:04,620
Well in all honesty all that money probably went to the celebrities that you that they had in the game because I mean they got

1212
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:06,940
Slash and

1213
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:14,220
Tom Morello, and I think a lot of original versions of songs too. Yeah, and like the lead singer from poison

1214
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:19,660
I forgot what his name was Brett Michaels. He did all the all the motion capture for the singers in the game

1215
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:26,780
What did you think of the new version of anarchy in the UK? I

1216
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:31,220
Haven't gotten there. I never had heard that song before

1217
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:36,420
It's the first time I think the sex pistols have been together since the 70s

1218
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:42,580
To record anything. I I saw that that was an unlockable video that you could get so I might have to check that out

1219
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:47,860
I remember the old song and I know the bad bad guitar freaks cover, but I'm curious about what this man

1220
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,980
They were Monday must have been hard up for money then

1221
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:56,420
All right, well puppy we gotta let you go cuz we're gonna go wrap up the show but thanks so much for calling all right

1222
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:01,980
All right, right and come back to the show in the future. I don't live that way. All right, you better

1223
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,660
All right. Take care

1224
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:11,240
Escapist in our chat room says Brett Michaels should have paid to be in guitar hero 3 instead of being paid

1225
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:16,900
I kind of agree. It's great exposure for these folks and in some extent. I mean, I don't know God

1226
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:21,820
Maybe I'll see something controversial here. But some of these people are kind of washed up like Brett Michaels

1227
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:26,940
I mean, well, he has that show on vh1, but you know, yeah, where does it make a room washed up at all?

1228
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:32,820
Yes, that's true. That's you don't vh1. That's pretty much the definition of wash. Let me and true true and

1229
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:36,620
you know, I don't know slash is a great guitarist, but

1230
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:41,540
Not the mainstream doesn't talk about slash but now they might so you're right

1231
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:44,560
These guys maybe ought to be paying them to be in the game. Who knows?

1232
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:50,540
Anyhow, we've been going at this a long time. So I think it's finally time to wrap this up and call it a night

1233
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,880
So we're gonna go around and get everybody's

1234
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,360
Final thought actually, I do we didn't get last minute stories. They may have more than getting last minute

1235
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:02,680
I'm sorry, then let's get last minute stories real quick. Anyways, um, so a few things first off

1236
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,320
Let's see game stops drop their Xbox 360 product replacement plans

1237
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:14,220
So apparently now they're no longer fixing those. I guess Microsoft will have to do more of that

1238
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:17,220
Let's see here

1239
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:22,280
Grip shift has been rated for the Xbox 360 if you might remember that was like crappy ass game

1240
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:26,060
They came out on the PlayStation Network and also on the PSP

1241
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:32,460
I highly recommend if it does come out on live arcade do not fucking buy it. It's horrible horrible horrible

1242
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:40,540
That crappy Xbox live arcade game stick is now 50% cheaper in the UK still shouldn't buy it though

1243
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:48,460
There is a wonderful application made by Microsoft. I guess employee Adam Keener or Kenny

1244
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,340
Kenny

1245
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:58,080
Anyways, it's Xbox live friend tracker. It's a little sidebar program that you run in Windows that will allow you to

1246
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:05,080
Track your friends on live kind of fun. There was a new we channel that was announced that kind of got

1247
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,080
under the radar here apparently the

1248
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:16,560
Channel is nicknamed as a TV program schedule channel. In other words, it's a channel where you can find out what's on TV

1249
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:22,080
I don't know about I don't know about you, but I'm pretty sure on most cable networks

1250
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:27,080
Especially if it's satellite or digital cable. There's a guide button on your remote

1251
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:33,080
To see what's on TV. Do we really need this on here and people are speculating?

1252
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:38,440
Oh, it's gonna lead to an lead to an IP TV channel. Yeah, where the fuck are you gonna store that shit on the Wii?

1253
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:40,520
That's what I'd like to know

1254
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,080
If you're ordering Super Mario Galaxy

1255
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:49,440
You ain't getting your pre-order coin until the fucking game comes out not that you really should order the game

1256
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:56,020
Because of that coin also might remind you that that game is gonna be fucking hard to find around holidays

1257
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,560
So if you haven't pre-ordered it yet

1258
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:03,700
It's time to do it because it's gonna be like the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess where it's near impossible to find

1259
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:11,360
And then finally Gran Turismo 5 they've had some of the features announced for it including there's gonna be an online

1260
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:17,820
Garage course online head-to-head racing time trials track of the day be spec race

1261
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:25,620
a license test drift contest tuning and setting features friends lists Lobby voice chat bulletin board

1262
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:27,900
spectator mode

1263
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:30,000
team building club building

1264
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:36,140
Color and other editors and looks like some other fun stuff

1265
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:43,940
So photo albums also lots of wonderful features at for game that's not going to come out until Christmas of next year if that oh

1266
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:50,660
Oh, and by the way, there's also something fun in the little Sears ad that was on go

1267
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:54,580
Nintendo dot-com and I tell you this also tickles me

1268
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:57,140
Rose and gold as well

1269
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:05,460
Nice in other words it also they basically have the two DS light bundles one with triforces on it one with a paw print

1270
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:10,380
the one the triforce is gold comes with Zelda the one of the paw print comes with a special edition of

1271
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,180
intend dogs

1272
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:15,180
another Nintendo one for

1273
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,380
149 99 each nice

1274
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:21,260
There you have it. There you go

1275
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:27,540
Do you have anything to our sara for last-minute stories? I have hunger you have hunger I hunger I

1276
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,580
Hunger to end this show. So we've been going at this for a while

1277
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:34,740
So it's time to wrap it up now. We can go around and get everybody's final thought

1278
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:41,620
I will start tonight. My final thought is I want to take a bubble bath really bad and soak my injuries. I'll be fun

1279
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:45,700
Dark Sakura, I'm sorry that I forgot to bring you the lotion

1280
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:49,580
I was gonna be okay, but I can give it to you tomorrow. Sure or if you want to come by

1281
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,580
I don't know about tomorrow because tomorrow is

1282
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:55,580
The boyfriend's birthday. So we're pretty busy, but maybe go to

1283
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:03,120
Go look for anything with Arnica in it. Okay. This is my natural remedies session

1284
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:05,980
But now I need something for my toothache

1285
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:12,180
I guess I really don't want to go to the dentist because I hate going close oil use car salesman. All right clove oil

1286
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:14,500
Not on the gum bomb teeth on the tooth

1287
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:18,120
Um, that's what they used to use in dentist office back in the day Wow

1288
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,700
but um

1289
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,980
Yeah, I'm

1290
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:28,020
Going to be very strict for the next three weeks until Thanksgiving because when I go to Alabama

1291
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:31,860
I am gonna eat fried chicken and grits and shake and fried chicken liver

1292
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:37,060
I don't talk about food. That sounds yummy fried chicken sounds good right now. I love fried chicken liver with country gravy

1293
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:42,500
I'm gonna have fried catfish and I'm not going to do anything. It's a vacation from everything and

1294
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,500
