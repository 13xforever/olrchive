WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.360
Tonight, October 7th, 2007, Bungie and Microsoft file for divorce, World of Warcraft celebrates

00:20.360 --> 00:29.760
alcohol, and Nintendo gives something away to all Wii owners.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.920
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:35.920 --> 00:40.320
We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

00:40.320 --> 00:42.320
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.480
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.740
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:47.740 --> 00:50.080
I'm starting Octoberfest early.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.080
Are you?

00:51.080 --> 00:52.080
Yes I am, with British ale.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.080
Enjoy.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.080
What are you drinking tonight?

00:54.080 --> 00:55.080
Newcastle.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.080
Yummy.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.080
Best ever.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.400
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.520
I'm drinking watered down Coke from McDonald's.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.280
You sure don't have a party.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.400
I'm very disappointed in your Germanness.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.000
Their fries sucked.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.360
And also say hello, joining us tonight, this somebody has not been on our program in a

01:14.360 --> 01:16.420
damn long time, but he's here tonight.

01:16.420 --> 01:19.480
Say hello to Black Lab, aka Puppy.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.920
I made it out of Davis alive, thank God.

01:21.920 --> 01:26.420
Yes, he used to be our correspondent for the People's Republic of Davis, which if you live

01:26.420 --> 01:30.720
where our show is taped, Sacramento, you understand why that joke is funny, but if you're an international

01:30.720 --> 01:34.120
or national listener, you have no clue what we're talking about, but just trust us, it's

01:34.120 --> 01:35.120
funny.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.800
But you're free from the perils of Davis now.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.800
Yes I am.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.800
And you're living on your own.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.800
Yes, actually, I am.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.520
They've let you out of the prisoner camp.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.880
Rule number one of living on your own, make sure the mic is real close to your mouth,

01:43.880 --> 01:44.880
because they're not very sensitive.

01:44.880 --> 01:45.880
Okay.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.160
Just don't eat it.

01:47.160 --> 01:51.340
So what have you been up to since you've been on the show last?

01:51.340 --> 01:52.800
How long has it been?

01:52.800 --> 01:54.040
It's been like at least a year now.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.560
Aren't we in double digits?

01:55.560 --> 01:56.560
I think so.

01:56.560 --> 01:57.560
The first time he was here.

01:57.560 --> 02:01.040
Well, Puppy, you used to work in an arcade, and that's one thing you used to kind of come

02:01.040 --> 02:03.140
on the show and talk to us about.

02:03.140 --> 02:05.040
What arcade did you use to work at a long time ago?

02:05.040 --> 02:06.280
Castro Valley Golf Land.

02:06.280 --> 02:10.640
And what kinds of big popular machines were there at Castro Valley Golf Land?

02:10.640 --> 02:14.080
Oh, I think one of them dancing machines, I think.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.080
Oh, the dance game?

02:15.080 --> 02:16.480
Oh, they had Time Crisis 3.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.480
That was pretty popular.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.280
That all the dancing fools played?

02:19.280 --> 02:20.600
Yeah, yeah.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.400
I think I was one of them.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.840
All right.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.960
So would you say that the skills that you learned working at an arcade have helped you

02:27.960 --> 02:28.960
in the real world?

02:28.960 --> 02:29.960
No.

02:29.960 --> 02:30.960
No.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.440
You didn't learn anything there, huh?

02:33.440 --> 02:34.440
Not a damn thing.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.200
Except that I hate kids.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.920
It was one step above flipping burgers, yes?

02:38.920 --> 02:39.920
Yeah.

02:39.920 --> 02:40.920
Or would you...

02:40.920 --> 02:44.080
I still had to serve pizza on weekends for parties, but...

02:44.080 --> 02:49.640
Or in retrospect, would you rather have been frying French fries incorrectly at McDonald's?

02:49.640 --> 02:53.800
I would know how to fry something at McDonald's because I would actually understand the instrument.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.800
Instructional videos.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.920
Everyone is listening to my ass right now.

02:56.920 --> 02:57.920
Yeah, Jamie just sat on the...

02:57.920 --> 03:00.880
There was one time that people got pissed off at McDonald's because I was sitting in

03:00.880 --> 03:05.240
the middle of the lobby with a chair that I had pulled out from a table and sitting

03:05.240 --> 03:08.720
there talking because my friends were all talking and just sitting there and talking

03:08.720 --> 03:11.800
or basically standing there and talking, and I got tired of standing there so I pulled

03:11.800 --> 03:16.240
over a chair and sat down next to everybody, and then the manager comes over and he's like,

03:16.240 --> 03:18.960
what the fuck is that chair doing in the middle of this lobby?

03:18.960 --> 03:22.480
Meanwhile, I mean, it's like they're almost closed anyways and there's no one there.

03:22.480 --> 03:23.480
Is that how they really talk?

03:23.480 --> 03:24.840
What about a bunch of potty mouths?

03:24.840 --> 03:29.520
Well, he was a stoner, so... an angry stoner, which is weird.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.600
How do you have an angry stoner?

03:30.600 --> 03:31.600
I know.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.600
How do you get an angry stoner?

03:32.600 --> 03:33.600
Easy.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.000
You don't give him any pot, then he's an angry stoner.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Or what?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.400
Don't give him Twinkies?

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
Or something like that.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.400
Well, he's into McDonald's.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.840
I mean, he can eat a bunch of shit.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.840
I'd be angry there and not even have to work there.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.680
My other friends used to work at McDonald's.

03:45.680 --> 03:50.600
We, on the other hand, were part of another clique, the Round Table Gang.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.840
The Round Table Gang?

03:51.840 --> 03:52.840
No, not really.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.560
Boy, that sounds threatening.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.800
Hey, we're gonna pizza your face!

03:56.800 --> 03:57.800
I don't know.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.280
I got to operate a large knife.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.280
No.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.040
Really, no, I didn't go around going, hey, we're part of the Round Table Gang.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.680
No, we worked at Round Table.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.720
We're a commune of Round Table people.

04:08.720 --> 04:12.240
Well, folks, you'll notice there's two empty chairs back here if you're watching on our

04:12.240 --> 04:14.840
Operator 11 live webcam or our archive.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.040
There's two empty chairs back here.

04:16.040 --> 04:20.560
That's because Rice Princess and Casper the Gay, or whatever his name is, are joining

04:20.560 --> 04:25.400
us tonight, but they're late because they're at Target doing, or, I'm sorry, as Casper

04:25.400 --> 04:29.240
might say, Tar-jay, getting Lord knows what at Target.

04:29.240 --> 04:33.440
So they're not, hopefully a table, a real table for Loki, we'll see.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.440
But they're not here.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.860
I don't need a table because there would be no room for a table in here.

04:36.860 --> 04:37.860
But they'll be here.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.860
But who needs them?

04:38.860 --> 04:39.860
Because we have the chat.

04:39.860 --> 04:40.860
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

04:40.860 --> 04:41.860
We love our chatters.

04:41.860 --> 04:43.520
Thank you guys so much for joining us.

04:43.520 --> 04:47.640
And let me just start off by saying, if you're listening tonight, this is episode number

04:47.640 --> 04:50.740
250 of Orange Lounge Radio, if you can believe it.

04:50.740 --> 04:51.740
That's quite a landmark.

04:51.740 --> 04:52.740
That's the beer.

04:52.740 --> 04:55.240
And in fact, all of you guys who are listening, congratulations.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.360
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.360
Oops.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.360
No, not that.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.680
I don't have to be an edit.

05:02.680 --> 05:05.400
I started drinking a little early tonight.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.000
And for those of you guys who are listening live, congratulations.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.300
You just unlocked an achievement.

05:10.300 --> 05:12.840
You just survived 250 episodes of this crap.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.640
So you get 100 points and your game was scored.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.640
Congratulations.

05:16.640 --> 05:21.600
All right, let's get into our gaming week and start it off with Dark Soccer.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.600
How was your gaming week?

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
I'm eating popcorn.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.600
Just get me.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.600
All right, then Logie.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.600
Come back to me.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.600
All right.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.600
God, you're needy tonight.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.600
All right.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.000
I'm going to go sit in the chairs, because I feel bad that the OP11 people are looking

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
at nothing.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
So I'll sit in the chairs.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm looking at my laptop, apparently.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
All right.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Hey, Pete.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
All right.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.200
So this week, I played a shit ton of Ragnarok.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.600
And I'm not talking about my regular, you know, butt load.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.460
I'm talking about a shit ton of Ragnarok.

05:45.460 --> 05:46.660
So it's like a shit ton.

05:46.660 --> 05:47.660
Is that like metric?

05:47.660 --> 05:48.660
It's metric.

05:48.660 --> 05:55.720
Or if I was going to go with the Don French description, it would be croc shit, sir Ragnarok.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.920
Or like shit kilo, you know.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.920
So I have been, I decided to start a new class.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.140
I started it last night.

06:04.140 --> 06:06.840
It's called the Taekwon Girl.

06:06.840 --> 06:11.360
And you don't get weapons, you just kick things in the face.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.440
You just kick them in the face.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.000
Can we get a live demonstration?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Puppy, lie down.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
No.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.400
I don't think so.

06:19.400 --> 06:23.080
And then I started the character last night, and I'm playing today.

06:23.080 --> 06:28.620
Got her up to a star gladiator, which was actually kind of a really weird game earlier.

06:28.620 --> 06:33.600
So I now have her at level 70.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.960
And I started her yesterday.

06:35.960 --> 06:36.960
Last night.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.520
Go pirate servers.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.520
Awesome job.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.520
All right.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.320
And I don't have to work tomorrow, so I'm going to play more games tomorrow.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.320
Good job.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.320
Well, sounds good.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.400
Well, let's keep right on moving along.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.600
Loki, how was your gaming week?

06:48.600 --> 06:50.200
My gaming week was fun.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.200
I've been continuing playing Halo on Legendary.

06:53.200 --> 06:59.600
I finally got past the part that I was stuck because I realized, hey, I can go backtrack

06:59.600 --> 07:01.160
and there's a ton of weapons back there.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.160
Holy shit.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.400
Forgot all about that stuff.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.080
And so you can play with the AI because they won't go past a certain part.

07:06.080 --> 07:11.180
They'll chase after you and stuff and be like, ha, I'm in the save zone or some shit.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.900
You can't attack me and they'll run back.

07:13.900 --> 07:14.900
It's funny.

07:14.900 --> 07:15.900
The AI is kind of dumb.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.960
Have you done the confetti head thing?

07:17.960 --> 07:18.960
No.

07:18.960 --> 07:22.480
I'm playing through just by myself.

07:22.480 --> 07:26.980
Dark Soccer's husband showed me the head shot confetti thing.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.480
That is hilarious.

07:28.480 --> 07:32.920
It makes, like you shoot off the thing and it makes this little, I think we have the

07:32.920 --> 07:35.160
exact same noise in our audio library.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.860
It has these little kids cheering when you do it.

07:38.860 --> 07:40.120
I'm looking for the, keep going.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.120
I'll imitate them anyways.

07:42.120 --> 07:48.960
So other stuff I've been playing, I actually bought, what was it, Flat Out Ultimate Carnage.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.700
That game is fucking awesome.

07:50.700 --> 07:53.720
It's just lots of driving, crashing into things.

07:53.720 --> 08:00.040
I played the Ragdoll Olympics stuff for quite a while, so I was launching my character through

08:00.040 --> 08:05.720
windshields and flinging him down a ski slope, stuff like that.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.000
Real fun game though.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.800
And see other stuff I've been playing, actually, you know, I think that's about it.

08:12.800 --> 08:17.320
I'm kind of working a little bit through the Jackass PSP game still.

08:17.320 --> 08:21.440
And then, I don't know, I meant to get more games this week, but I didn't get around to

08:21.440 --> 08:22.440
it.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.360
So, maybe next week, you know.

08:24.360 --> 08:29.400
And then I also meant to play the Simpsons demo because I downloaded it on my PS3.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.920
But I didn't get a chance to play it because my wife wanted to watch Food Network instead.

08:32.920 --> 08:33.920
So.

08:33.920 --> 08:35.920
Food Network is great.

08:35.920 --> 08:37.360
Awesome.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.680
So is that it for your gaming week?

08:38.680 --> 08:39.680
That is it.

08:39.680 --> 08:40.680
All right.

08:40.680 --> 08:41.680
Puppy!

08:41.680 --> 08:43.240
Since you're here tonight, have you been playing any video games this week?

08:43.240 --> 08:44.240
If so, what?

08:44.240 --> 08:45.240
And how's it going?

08:45.240 --> 08:49.200
I actually have been playing games about, I didn't have any systems until about a month

08:49.200 --> 08:53.200
ago and then I finally caved and bought a 360.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.800
And I've just been playing Halo for the last week and a half.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.320
You need to come to our house and play Halo 3 with us.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.520
I might try to do that.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.920
And how is Halo going?

09:03.920 --> 09:06.000
Are you a big fan of the Halo?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.120
Yeah, I am.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.800
Sadly.

09:09.800 --> 09:15.720
I'm still confused by some things in the plot and other than that, I just shoot things.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.840
And I like the little grunt head explosions.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.880
Yes, I found the sound effects.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.600
So when you shoot them in the head, you get this.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.680
It makes that little sound effect.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.100
And a little confetti blows up everywhere.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.100
It's awesome.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.280
It's fun when you turn up the explosions on that too so that when you shoot one in the

09:30.280 --> 09:33.600
head, all the ones around them go off too and explode.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.640
Time was going around punching people in the head with the skull.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.860
That was pretty cool.

09:39.860 --> 09:41.280
So that's it for your gaming week?

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
Yeah, pretty much.

09:42.280 --> 09:47.920
I was playing WoW for a while, but ever since Halo 3 came out, I pretty much stopped.

09:47.920 --> 09:52.380
Well finally joining us, they're a little bit late tonight, so you guys are so fired,

09:52.380 --> 09:53.380
but they're here in studio.

09:53.380 --> 09:56.760
Say hello to Rice Princess and what are we calling you now, Casper?

09:56.760 --> 09:59.760
Casper the gang.

09:59.760 --> 10:00.760
He's Eddie to me.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.880
He'll always be Eddie.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.080
So Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

10:04.080 --> 10:07.080
What have you been playing?

10:07.080 --> 10:08.080
Wow.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.120
Does it ever change really?

10:11.120 --> 10:12.120
That's pretty much it.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.400
Hey, you have my sweater.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.400
I'm so glad.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.840
Yes, you left your sweater here.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.920
My Alliance sweater.

10:17.920 --> 10:21.320
What's hilarious is that the only way we knew who it belonged to is that we saw that it

10:21.320 --> 10:26.800
was an Alliance sweatshirt that you left here and we were like, who the fuck plays Alliance?

10:26.800 --> 10:27.800
Only cool people do.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.120
And we were like, oh, it must be Rice Princess.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.120
Bleh.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.120
Whatever.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.120
Please take this thing out of my house.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.120
I will.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.120
She's an Alliance character, at least she's sort of evil.

10:34.120 --> 10:38.080
The only reason worth playing Alliance is for the Jurnai, but it gets old.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.080
Whatever.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.080
Whatever.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.080
And if you want to play with 12 year olds.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.080
You can play a warlock.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.560
And if you want to play a cool side.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.160
You can play warlocks on Horde's side.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.160
They're much cooler.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.160
Warlocks are much better.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.160
Because undead are horse.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.160
Warlocks are lame.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.160
You're lame.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.160
Anyway, anything else you want to add?

10:51.160 --> 10:54.160
Before we turn into the wow cast, is there anything else you want to share for your gaming

10:54.160 --> 10:55.160
week?

10:55.160 --> 10:56.160
No.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.160
All right.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.160
Then Casper, how was your gaming week?

10:58.160 --> 10:59.160
It was awesome.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.680
I got Phantom Hourglass, new Zelda game for DS.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.680
It was really good.

11:02.680 --> 11:03.680
You like it?

11:03.680 --> 11:04.680
Yeah, it's really good.

11:04.680 --> 11:08.680
Finally, they get to not make you fumble between the D-pad and the buttons and the stylus all

11:08.680 --> 11:09.840
at the same time.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.520
It's all stylus and it's very smooth.

11:11.520 --> 11:15.320
It's a very cool control style.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.120
So tell me a little more about it, because I'm contemplating if I want to buy it or not.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.660
So how does it play compared to the other Zeldas?

11:20.660 --> 11:22.160
Is it more Wind Waker?

11:22.160 --> 11:24.200
Is it more Super Nintendo Zelda?

11:24.200 --> 11:25.420
It's a direct sequel to Wind Waker.

11:25.420 --> 11:28.840
It takes place right after the end of Wind Waker.

11:28.840 --> 11:29.840
Same style.

11:29.840 --> 11:30.840
It's like that cel shading.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.680
It's pretty good for the DS, but it still looks pretty good.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.720
Just really cool control style.

11:35.720 --> 11:39.960
You basically slash with the stylus on the screen or you tap things to attack them, all

11:39.960 --> 11:41.840
that kind of stuff.

11:41.840 --> 11:46.000
There's a map screen that you write on, write little notes and stuff, which I thought would

11:46.000 --> 11:48.160
be kind of gimmicky at first, but it actually works out.

11:48.160 --> 11:51.960
Some of the puzzles are centered around making notes and things like that, so it's pretty

11:51.960 --> 11:52.960
cool.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.960
Good times.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.560
So on a scale of 1 to 10, but you're a Zelda fan boy.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.960
I'm a Zelda fan boy.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.240
I'm not a huge fan of Wind Waker, but it's still good.

12:01.240 --> 12:05.520
You know, I'm hoping that Ganon's in there somewhere, but I haven't gotten that far yet.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.120
And GS68 in our chat room is screaming, no spoilers.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.120
So please don't.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.120
I'm not that far, so I really can't spoil anything.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.680
I don't use the no spoilers until Aris gets it, so go ahead and spoil.

12:14.680 --> 12:15.680
I don't care.

12:15.680 --> 12:16.680
Let her die!

12:16.680 --> 12:18.680
Yeah, Link dies at the end.

12:18.680 --> 12:19.680
Ah!

12:19.680 --> 12:20.680
All right.

12:20.680 --> 12:25.020
Anyhow, my gaming week, I've also been playing World of Warcraft.

12:25.020 --> 12:27.280
I got to level 68, so I have a flying mount now.

12:27.280 --> 12:32.520
Or I am a flying mount, because I play a druid, so I get a free flying mount.

12:32.520 --> 12:36.480
Or if it's not free, it costs me eight gold.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.420
And I ran instances.

12:39.420 --> 12:43.280
As a guild, we ran underbog and slave pens.

12:43.280 --> 12:48.480
And that's how I leveled.

12:48.480 --> 12:52.280
I feel like this week's episode of the Sarah Silverman program, all of a sudden, where

12:52.280 --> 12:54.280
they were playing D&D for 24 hours straight.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.280
Anyway.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.280
I've done that.

12:56.280 --> 12:59.360
You're the hardcorest of the nerds.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.960
You're queen of the nerd people.

13:01.960 --> 13:02.960
She's just a princess.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.720
You're the queen.

13:04.720 --> 13:05.720
Let's see.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.000
So also my gaming week, I played Tetris Splash.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.560
I actually bought the new Tetris Splash, which was the Xbox Live arcade game of the week.

13:12.560 --> 13:13.720
And Tetris Splash is okay.

13:13.720 --> 13:18.680
I mean, it's Tetris, and it has its competitive mode, which plays really smoothly on Xbox

13:18.680 --> 13:20.160
Live, I've got to say.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.680
And seems like the audience of people playing the game, not a lot of jerks, which is good.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.680
You get some pretty good people.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.360
Some people who are really skilled at Tetris.

13:26.360 --> 13:30.160
I got my butt whooped in a ranked match by some people who are really good at Tetris,

13:30.160 --> 13:31.160
and I'm not so competitive.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.160
Tetris is fun.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.160
They have that on DS.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.160
And it was like, it's crazy.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.160
I'm like, Tetris.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.160
Oh, but it's fun.

13:36.160 --> 13:40.160
Here's why Tetris Splash pissed me off, though, is it just made the fact that I actually bought

13:40.160 --> 13:43.000
Tetris Evolution even more salt in the wound.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.040
Because that game was like 30 bucks on Xbox 360, and then it releases a $10 version.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.360
I'm so mad.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.520
Like why did they do that?

13:50.520 --> 13:51.520
Why?

13:51.520 --> 13:53.480
They didn't even wait like six months.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.280
Tetris Evolution came out like three months ago.

13:56.280 --> 14:00.640
And now we have an even slightly, I don't know if you'd say better version.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.200
I think it is kind of a better version.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.200
It doesn't have the HD videos.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.960
It has that stupid aquarium.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.120
It looks like a screensaver from After Dark.

14:08.120 --> 14:13.400
But here's the thing that pissed me off about that is, have you heard about the microtransactions

14:13.400 --> 14:14.400
with this?

14:14.400 --> 14:15.400
No.

14:15.400 --> 14:22.280
The day they released Tetris Splash on Xbox Live Arcade.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.960
They released 15 different download packs for Tetris Splash.

14:25.960 --> 14:26.960
What?

14:26.960 --> 14:28.120
No, maybe it's like 11.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.960
But it's more than 10.

14:29.960 --> 14:36.880
Between 80 and 150 points per download, and you know what these things are?

14:36.880 --> 14:42.960
They're just new fish for your tank, or new tanks to put the fish in.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.800
Now let me ask you, do you play Tetris to stare at the background?

14:46.800 --> 14:47.840
No.

14:47.840 --> 14:53.120
So what's the point of downloading fish and fish tanks?

14:53.120 --> 14:55.520
Then don't buy it.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.160
There's a sucker born every second.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.160
How about this?

14:58.160 --> 15:01.100
It's either that or they could have made the game more expensive and threw them in there

15:01.100 --> 15:04.600
for free, which I think would have been a better move to make the money.

15:04.600 --> 15:09.240
I think a better move would have been what they were starting to do, which is you unlock

15:09.240 --> 15:13.560
more fish as you unlock more achievements or you get lines in the game.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.680
You and your logic and your critical thinking.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.040
I mean, heaven forbid, I could not believe that.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.360
If you buy this stuff, you're a sucker.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.280
You're an absolute sucker.

15:23.280 --> 15:30.800
When you buy this stuff, I got some Guitar Hero download packs for you.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.920
I love Tetris, which is why this makes me mad.

15:32.920 --> 15:37.080
I feel like Tetris on the 360 is like fucked beyond belief between this whole evolution

15:37.080 --> 15:40.020
and now microtransaction fish tank thing.

15:40.020 --> 15:43.160
By the way, Rob, I hate the word microtransaction.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.160
Well that's what it is.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.240
A microtransaction is a transaction no matter how big or small.

15:46.240 --> 15:51.240
Well that's what they call it, but why don't you write a letter to EA and all those people.

15:51.240 --> 15:54.080
I have the same problem with pre-boarding because you're not really pre-boarding, you're

15:54.080 --> 15:55.080
just boarding.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.080
Early.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.880
Why you got to derail my segment, huh?

15:59.880 --> 16:03.400
Well technically a microtransaction is an accurate description.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.680
It's a transaction that is small, hence micro.

16:06.680 --> 16:10.320
If it were a Jolly Rancher for five cents, would that be a microtransaction?

16:10.320 --> 16:11.320
This is a sucker.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.680
Yes, it would be a microtransaction.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.960
What defines micro or macro?

16:14.960 --> 16:18.360
This is a suck transaction because if you buy this, you suck.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.600
If I buy a computer, is it a macrotransaction?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.320
If you support this, you suck.

16:22.320 --> 16:26.280
A macrotransaction would be, for example, let's say Oblivion.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.400
When you buy the retail copy of Oblivion, that would be a macrotransaction.

16:29.400 --> 16:35.480
When you buy add-on content that is cheaper than the purchase of the game, that is a microtransaction.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.520
I would think that buying the system would be the macrotransaction.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.720
I cannot believe we're having an argument.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.400
Would be a neutral transaction.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.840
And 2.

16:43.840 --> 16:44.840
Fight!

16:44.840 --> 16:46.760
It was a neutral transaction, then.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.880
This is the Semantics webcast.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.960
Let me be exchanged.

16:50.960 --> 16:56.840
GS68 in our chatroom says, buying a PS3 equals a macrotransaction.

16:56.840 --> 17:01.080
That's like a super macro suck transaction.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.080
Alright.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.120
Sorry, ring the bell.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.120
It's a major transaction.

17:05.120 --> 17:08.240
Sorry, I made a little dig on the PS3.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.080
Alright, so that's everybody's gaming week.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.080
Yes, we've hit everybody.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.080
Alright.

17:12.080 --> 17:16.680
Let's get into housekeeping tonight, and of course tonight is episode number 250.

17:16.680 --> 17:17.680
Yay.

17:17.680 --> 17:18.680
Yay!

17:18.680 --> 17:22.440
We didn't do anything special tonight, really, except have a lot of guests here, because

17:22.440 --> 17:27.720
we don't want to celebrate ourselves more than once in a year, because that's just,

17:27.720 --> 17:29.240
I don't know, that's too much ego.

17:29.240 --> 17:33.200
Like once a year is acceptable, and we did that with our five-year anniversary show,

17:33.200 --> 17:36.800
but if we were to kind of like promote, hey, it's episode 250, everybody should congratulate

17:36.800 --> 17:37.800
us again.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.420
That's like celebrating your anniversaries with your spouse or something every month

17:41.420 --> 17:42.420
or something.

17:42.420 --> 17:43.420
It's like our 13-month anniversary.

17:43.420 --> 17:44.420
Yeah, awesome.

17:44.420 --> 17:45.420
Exactly.

17:45.420 --> 17:46.420
That's what it is.

17:46.420 --> 17:49.320
After a while, it's just like, eh, whatever.

17:49.320 --> 17:53.280
So yeah, this is just an eh, whatever episode of Orange Island Radio, but we do have some

17:53.280 --> 17:54.840
special stuff tonight.

17:54.840 --> 17:59.360
We actually have Insanist is one of our correspondents in Seattle.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.840
He's actually, since he lives in Seattle, he's at the World Cyber Games this weekend,

18:02.840 --> 18:06.040
and he actually called us a little earlier today to say this.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.040
Hello, Orange Island Radio.

18:08.040 --> 18:13.480
This is Insanist reporting live from Seattle, Washington here Sunday, October 7th, 2007.

18:13.480 --> 18:19.400
I'm calling to let you know that you missed out on some extraordinary goings on here at

18:19.400 --> 18:20.400
the World Cyber Games.

18:20.400 --> 18:24.320
For those of you not familiar, the Olympics of video games.

18:24.320 --> 18:31.200
There were people from 74 countries, 700 gamers playing 12 different games, ranging from Command

18:31.200 --> 18:37.120
and Conquer 3 all the way to a huge favorite, StarCraft.

18:37.120 --> 18:43.280
Lots of huge upsets, which my partner and kind of DJ Tyrant will get to you later about.

18:43.280 --> 18:47.640
I'm telling you that this is something you don't ever want to miss.

18:47.640 --> 18:52.960
It's a one of a kind event, meeting people from all sorts of countries at the press events,

18:52.960 --> 18:55.960
at press tournaments, everything.

18:55.960 --> 19:03.880
I actually, probably the funniest thing at any sort of tournament or competition I tried

19:03.880 --> 19:11.720
to enter, I lost to somebody from another country every single time.

19:11.720 --> 19:17.480
But just being able to take in all the cultural aspects, but just being here as one, all as

19:17.480 --> 19:21.680
gamers, just having a good time was great.

19:21.680 --> 19:26.320
Seeing people play, rock bands from different countries, and yes, I did hear somebody from

19:26.320 --> 19:33.480
China try to sing Black Hole Sun, and it was kind of funny, but that's very mean, but it

19:33.480 --> 19:36.240
was a great, great event.

19:36.240 --> 19:40.840
The next one is in Cologne, Germany, so any new European listeners to Orange on Radio,

19:40.840 --> 19:42.920
I recommend you take the trip out and go.

19:42.920 --> 19:47.560
DJ Tyrant and I are actually thinking about going, so maybe we'll see you there.

19:47.560 --> 19:52.860
But more, excuse me, I'm walking about downtown Seattle as I do this.

19:52.860 --> 19:57.760
But for Orange on Radio, I'm insane as, to hear more about this, listen to our show The

19:57.760 --> 20:05.000
Insanist Hour featuring SDFU every Thursday at 7.30 Pacific time, until then, I'm Insanist,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
take care.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.320
Thank you very much Insanist for your little report there from the World Cyber Games, he

20:10.320 --> 20:13.640
was raving about it, like he was calling me literally every day about something that was

20:13.640 --> 20:17.140
going on, he called me the other day, he's like, hey Rob, I got to play one of the other

20:17.140 --> 20:24.000
all-game shows in some press competition, and I beat him, and I was like, go, you sound

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
like you're having a lot of fun.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.640
One of the games was ChromeHounds because I think it was Madden, so I was, I don't think

20:31.640 --> 20:34.280
he was actually playing all games interactive, I think he was playing one of the other shows

20:34.280 --> 20:36.920
there, I want to say it was Game Addict Hotline.

20:36.920 --> 20:44.420
Really the real losers of ChromeHounds would be anyone that bought the game, unfortunately.

20:44.420 --> 20:48.440
Now Loki, if I heard you right during the tape segment there, you were dissing World

20:48.440 --> 20:50.120
Cyber Games a little bit, what's your issue?

20:50.120 --> 20:51.120
I think it's stupid.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.120
Why?

20:52.120 --> 20:55.680
I mean it's cool that I guess a bunch of people come together, but don't refer to it as like

20:55.680 --> 21:01.640
the fucking Olympics or anything like that, I mean, seriously, to me the World Cyber Games

21:01.640 --> 21:05.600
kind of reminds me of like the professional gaming leagues and shit like that, I fucking

21:05.600 --> 21:10.800
hate those, I really do, that's like trying to launch the fucking XFL, I mean it's retarded,

21:10.800 --> 21:15.520
no one's going to want to watch you play games, don't broadcast it, it's boring.

21:15.520 --> 21:18.280
The XFL was actually kind of fun.

21:18.280 --> 21:22.520
It's kind of weird because I know in like, I guess it's Korea, they have professional

21:22.520 --> 21:29.840
gamers that make a lot of money for the spectator, but you're saying that it's not a spectator

21:29.840 --> 21:34.600
type of deal, but it kind of is, it just depends on what region you're in.

21:34.600 --> 21:39.920
If you've ever watched that stupid show that was on G4 a while back, Arena, it was the

21:39.920 --> 21:41.120
most boring thing to watch.

21:41.120 --> 21:45.120
Well the problem was the way they put it together, they picked up kids off the street and tried

21:45.120 --> 21:47.360
to make it all like, rad.

21:47.360 --> 21:51.480
Well the problem is I think they really need to, if they're going to do something like

21:51.480 --> 21:56.000
this, any design games that are meant for this type of gameplay or anything like that,

21:56.000 --> 22:00.840
like Unreal Tournament or something, where you could actually set it up like, film it

22:00.840 --> 22:07.920
like you're doing an actual football or sporting event type of game, just something like that.

22:07.920 --> 22:12.960
Because flipping between people's screens and watching people do stuff, no one really

22:12.960 --> 22:15.360
cares and it's kind of dumb.

22:15.360 --> 22:19.600
I mean I guess it's cool if you're there at a DDR tournament or something like that, if

22:19.600 --> 22:23.800
you're there and participating and watching, that's cool, but as far as broadcasting it

22:23.800 --> 22:26.560
around the world, I don't think anyone cares.

22:26.560 --> 22:31.880
It's kind of sort of like how people like to watch football and stuff, actually being

22:31.880 --> 22:35.360
in the bleachers and watching the game as opposed to watching it on TV.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.960
Well even on TV though, at least, it's sort of interesting.

22:37.960 --> 22:41.560
If you watch it on TV you can turn it off.

22:41.560 --> 22:47.360
It doesn't take much to go, oh look at me, I'm fast at the reflexes, who cares, it doesn't

22:47.360 --> 22:48.760
take much to really build yourself up.

22:48.760 --> 22:51.680
I know a lot of people that are fascinated with watching people play video games.

22:51.680 --> 22:55.080
Yeah, we've all got that friend that's like, hey you want to play, no I'll just watch.

22:55.080 --> 22:58.640
It's like, oh okay, and they're like having a good time watching you, like Rice Princess,

22:58.640 --> 23:02.240
she's like, I'm going to watch you.

23:02.240 --> 23:04.760
That's like my roommate, he doesn't really play video games, but he's always kind of

23:04.760 --> 23:07.040
like, hey aren't you going to play Eternal Sonata again?

23:07.040 --> 23:10.560
I kind of want to know what happens.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.760
Why did you quit at Chapter 5?

23:12.760 --> 23:16.960
I like doing cooperative gaming, not like where both of you are actually playing the

23:16.960 --> 23:22.280
game, but like what Dan and I used to do, where he would, when we played Resident Evil,

23:22.280 --> 23:26.600
he would play through the game and I would go off the strategy guide or tell him where

23:26.600 --> 23:27.600
to go.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.600
Aw, bonding time.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.600
That's all storyline stuff.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.240
You want to know what happens in the storyline and stuff like that.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.000
That's a little different than saying, oh I want to watch you because you're so lead

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
at fucking Halo.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
You know what I mean?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.960
I don't, that's a little different.

23:38.960 --> 23:43.560
It's not like, I was watching Halo for the storyline, but then it stopped making sense.

23:43.560 --> 23:44.960
I mean seriously, it's different.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.960
Is there even a storyline?

23:46.960 --> 23:50.720
You're tuning in for like the story and not for the actual gameplay.

23:50.720 --> 23:54.720
I don't know why Halo 3 bothered with the story for real because I was playing co-op

23:54.720 --> 23:58.200
mode the other day and like, you know, we're walking through and what have you and we're

23:58.200 --> 23:59.440
shooting aliens, we're having a fun time.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.200
I'll tell you what, Halo 3 co-op mode is awesome.

24:01.200 --> 24:05.720
We're going through it and then suddenly Cortana's like, find me, you gotta find, I'm like, bitch,

24:05.720 --> 24:07.720
get off the screen!

24:07.720 --> 24:13.640
Wow, you got like so straight for a second there, that was like scary.

24:13.640 --> 24:17.280
And here's the funny thing about that, Rob, since I haven't played any of the other games,

24:17.280 --> 24:20.200
I don't understand the significance of finding her in the first place.

24:20.200 --> 24:23.120
I'm like, it's just a fucking computer, just let it go, come on, seriously.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.040
I thought she got exploded.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.640
Buy a new chick, I mean seriously.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.520
I don't know.

24:29.520 --> 24:34.360
See I lost a little something for not playing the other games, but I digress.

24:34.360 --> 24:39.360
So anyway, wow, really quickly though, people, what about the calls where people are like,

24:39.360 --> 24:42.480
I want to see DDR in the Olympics or that whole thing.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.480
No!

24:43.480 --> 24:44.480
You are stupid!

24:44.480 --> 24:45.480
Wait, hold on, hold on.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.480
Oh my god.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.600
What about this as an outlet for those people that want to see that?

24:48.600 --> 24:52.240
I mean, there are people that want to do gaming as a competitive sport and, you know, people

24:52.240 --> 24:56.280
that feel that, you know, why should gaming be any different from other sports that are

24:56.280 --> 24:57.280
outdoors?

24:57.280 --> 25:00.800
You know what, if you want to have gaming as a competitive sport, just do PVP mode on

25:00.800 --> 25:01.800
Ragnarok.

25:01.800 --> 25:02.800
End of story.

25:02.800 --> 25:10.560
Congratulations everybody, DarkSakura has leveled down the show, good job.

25:10.560 --> 25:11.560
Heart.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.560
Chat time.

25:13.560 --> 25:14.560
Yes.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.560
Oh, I got the finger.

25:16.560 --> 25:21.240
Why don't you put that finger up so the Op11 people can see it on the cam, there you go.

25:21.240 --> 25:22.240
Alright.

25:22.240 --> 25:24.960
Going to the chat room, because god, we haven't been paying attention to chat, I'm so sorry

25:24.960 --> 25:25.960
folks.

25:25.960 --> 25:26.960
Chat.orangewater.com.

25:26.960 --> 25:27.960
Macmanbabykicker.

25:27.960 --> 25:28.960
I don't know, why would you kick babykicker?

25:28.960 --> 25:34.840
Okay, Shane.

25:34.840 --> 25:39.760
Macman says, Cortana is significantly less hot in Halo 3, so therefore she doesn't deserve

25:39.760 --> 25:40.760
to be saved, apparently.

25:40.760 --> 25:42.760
She wasn't hot in the first Halo.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.400
She's not real.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.920
DDRDollarBill says, no DDR in the Olympics.

25:46.920 --> 25:47.920
I found that ironic.

25:47.920 --> 25:51.360
If she was a real chick or something, it might make more sense that you're trying to save

25:51.360 --> 25:53.720
her, but she's a fucking computer program.

25:53.720 --> 25:54.720
TigerClaws.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.720
Make a copy.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.680
Hey, don't copy that floppy.

25:59.680 --> 26:04.520
TigerClaws says, video games are becoming a spectator sport.

26:04.520 --> 26:08.120
Son of Dad says, didn't they broadcast some of the fighting game championships recently

26:08.120 --> 26:09.120
in Japan?

26:09.120 --> 26:10.120
See, that's Japan.

26:10.120 --> 26:14.240
They put weird shit on their TV, and you know what though, I respect them for that, because

26:14.240 --> 26:16.040
there's some cool shit on there.

26:16.040 --> 26:22.280
If only they'd fucking fill G4 full of all that cool shit in Japan, might be willing

26:22.280 --> 26:23.600
to watch that channel.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.400
They try, but they ban.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.400
So yeah.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.400
I mean, okay.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.400
DarkShy brings up a good point.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.400
Yes, please.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.400
I've seen King of Kong.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.400
It's very interesting.

26:32.400 --> 26:37.520
Yeah, DarkShy says they have a movie, they had a movie called King of Kong, by the way.

26:37.520 --> 26:40.840
It was about the, it was Twin Galaxies.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.840
Oh, they're bullshit.

26:42.840 --> 26:43.840
Right.

26:43.840 --> 26:49.720
And the guy, there was another guy who had completely trashed the guy that they put on

26:49.720 --> 26:53.720
Twin Galaxies score, and it was a big drama.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.480
Actually, I would suggest to everybody, watch through King of Kong.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.720
Well, see now, that's a good example, because people got really into that, and people, now

26:59.720 --> 27:03.080
I haven't seen the movie yet, but from what I've heard, people really get into it, and

27:03.080 --> 27:05.600
they're like rooting for one guy over the other guy.

27:05.600 --> 27:09.400
You know, that's, what about that for your whole argument where people don't want to...

27:09.400 --> 27:10.400
And to Ekem in...

27:10.400 --> 27:11.400
It's like Tommy.

27:11.400 --> 27:15.080
Now to Ekem in the chat room, the DDR show did not count.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.840
Hold on, you've got to read what they said before you respond to it.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.080
Hello, Radio 101.

27:20.080 --> 27:23.000
Ekem in the chat says, what did he say?

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Now I lost it.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.600
Oh yes, do I need to remind you of that crap DDR show on TV, to which you say, it doesn't

27:27.600 --> 27:28.600
count.

27:28.600 --> 27:29.600
Why not?

27:29.600 --> 27:33.400
Because, at first it was called Dance Revolution, and all it was was just fucking Mickey Mouse

27:33.400 --> 27:38.340
Club ripoff with the slumber party girls.

27:38.340 --> 27:39.340
Where are they now?

27:39.340 --> 27:40.340
Oh, that's right.

27:40.340 --> 27:41.800
No one's listening to them.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.320
Aw, how sad.

27:43.320 --> 27:46.200
So sad, yet another girl group gone.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.200
Aw.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.200
All right.

27:48.200 --> 27:52.020
Anyhow, let's, other housekeeping, real quick, I've got to say this, remember how last week

27:52.020 --> 27:55.800
we got a lot of phone calls on Digital Life, I even had to hang up on one caller over drama

27:55.800 --> 27:56.800
and all that stuff.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.600
Well, SSJ Matt, one of our listeners, was kind enough to send us a care package from

28:00.600 --> 28:01.600
Digital Life.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.560
So we got stuff from Digital Life.

28:03.560 --> 28:05.640
So we, yeah, we have this little squeeze brain.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.000
I have like 50 of those.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
For Glee Max.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.160
Well then, Eddie seemed to be interested in that, so there you go, Eddie.

28:11.160 --> 28:12.160
Let's see what we have here.

28:12.160 --> 28:16.800
We have a seven day free trial of Lord of the Rings Online.

28:16.800 --> 28:17.800
You want that?

28:17.800 --> 28:18.800
No.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.800
I don't have an Xbox.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.800
It's not for Xbox, it's PC.

28:20.800 --> 28:21.800
Oh yes.

28:21.800 --> 28:22.800
Do you have a DVD Rom?

28:22.800 --> 28:23.800
That's okay.

28:23.800 --> 28:24.800
It's not a very good game.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.800
There you go.

28:25.800 --> 28:26.800
I don't have a PC.

28:26.800 --> 28:30.160
There was supposed to be an MMORPG, Lord of the Rings for Wii, but I think they trucked

28:30.160 --> 28:31.160
it.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.160
All right, you're cut off from prizes.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.160
Ah.

28:33.160 --> 28:34.160
Eddie, there you go.

28:34.160 --> 28:37.160
This little flashlight, it says UMA on the side, a little flashlight.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.040
I'll take it, because I could use a flashlight.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.040
I don't think it works.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.040
I have my battery.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.440
It's an on-working flashlight.

28:42.440 --> 28:43.440
Hello.

28:43.440 --> 28:47.000
Look at this, all these VRares for DDR Universe.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
I'll take one.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.520
Wait, is that the original universe or the second one?

28:49.520 --> 28:50.520
No, it's the original universe.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.520
DDR Universe.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.520
I'll take one anyways.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.520
All right.

28:53.520 --> 28:54.520
I think I might have one, but I'd take one anyway.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.520
Well, here you go.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.520
And there you go.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.520
This is exciting radio.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.520
Look at this.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.520
Party gift for us.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.520
Oh my God.

29:00.520 --> 29:01.520
Are we going to joke?

29:01.520 --> 29:02.520
I was going to joke.

29:02.520 --> 29:03.520
Is there presents for the turn of 50?

29:03.520 --> 29:04.520
And here they are.

29:04.520 --> 29:07.180
Now this I might keep and give away at some point, because this is old.

29:07.180 --> 29:10.000
This is a DDR Max sampler from Toys R Us.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
I don't think they even make these anymore.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
That's the way they want.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
So we'll hang on to that.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.320
Did you want a universe sampler puppy?

29:14.320 --> 29:15.320
No.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.320
All right, there you go.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.320
Everybody wins.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.320
Here at Orange On Radio.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.320
I got a brain.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.320
Let's see, what else do we have here?

29:22.320 --> 29:23.320
You know, I...

29:23.320 --> 29:24.320
Oh, Loki's going to love this.

29:24.320 --> 29:25.320
There's no money.

29:25.320 --> 29:28.160
I emailed McNamara to send me some free shit, and he still has an email.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.160
Look at this.

29:29.160 --> 29:30.160
Here it is.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.160
Here it is, though.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.160
Authentic Eye of Judgment cards.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.160
Look at this.

29:33.160 --> 29:37.440
This is a card for the biolith bomber from the Eye of Judgment.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.600
Check that shit out right there.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.760
It even says right on the back, the Eye of Judgment.

29:40.760 --> 29:41.760
I'll take one.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.760
Wait, wait, wait.

29:42.760 --> 29:43.760
What?

29:43.760 --> 29:44.760
I'm going to make a copy of this.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.520
All right, you do that.

29:46.520 --> 29:47.880
Oh my God.

29:47.880 --> 29:50.000
That would be so impossible to copy.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Oh, wait.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.080
No, it won't be.

29:54.080 --> 29:59.080
A little doggy keychain there from Sirius Satellite Radio.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.080
A puppy should have that.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.080
Yeah, it is a puppy.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.400
So a puppy gets the puppy keychain.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.640
There you go.

30:03.640 --> 30:04.640
And let's see.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.400
Oh, some post-it notes from Newegg.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.360
Who wants post-it notes from Newegg?

30:09.360 --> 30:10.360
Dark Soccer does.

30:10.360 --> 30:11.360
Posties.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.360
There you go.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.360
And, oh, I like this.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.360
What is this?

30:14.360 --> 30:15.360
This is a little...

30:15.360 --> 30:16.360
What is this?

30:16.360 --> 30:17.360
An iPod mini skin?

30:17.360 --> 30:18.800
Oh, is that from iSkin?

30:18.800 --> 30:20.160
I don't know what this is.

30:20.160 --> 30:21.900
I can't tell.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.540
Is it an eraser?

30:23.540 --> 30:24.540
What is it?

30:24.540 --> 30:26.960
It looks like an eraser.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.160
Okay.

30:28.160 --> 30:33.400
And last but not least, last but not least, a lollipop with a ghost on it from Pac-Man.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.400
There you go.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.400
Who wants a lollipop?

30:35.400 --> 30:36.400
Oh, that's adorable.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.400
Don't anybody eat that.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.400
We'll just keep it forever and ever.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.400
It's our new mascot.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.400
There you go.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.680
It is, totally.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.920
Thank you, SSJ100 Matt, for the fabulous gifts and prizes.

30:44.920 --> 30:45.920
Appreciate it.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.600
Thank you.

30:47.600 --> 30:52.240
There is no way that these things will not be able to, you know, not be copied.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.240
These are...

30:53.240 --> 30:56.840
Puppy figured out what it is, the other little thing.

30:56.840 --> 30:57.840
It's a...

30:57.840 --> 31:01.720
I think it's an advertisement for one other company that makes iPod skins called Jelliskins,

31:01.720 --> 31:04.400
but they didn't actually put a real one on there.

31:04.400 --> 31:09.080
It's just a piece of plastic that looks like an iPod with a fake one around it and something

31:09.080 --> 31:13.640
on the back that says, take this to the booth and get two for one or something.

31:13.640 --> 31:17.120
Well somebody forgot to take it to the booth, so we get it now here in studio.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.680
Thank you for the prizes from Digital Life.

31:18.680 --> 31:19.680
We appreciate it.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.680
I think I'm going to peel this off.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.680
Alright.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.680
What are you...

31:24.680 --> 31:28.720
Oh, alright, anyway.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.880
I guess that's it for housekeeping tonight.

31:30.880 --> 31:34.840
Finally, I think we're only about 35 minutes into tonight's show and we can finally get

31:34.840 --> 31:36.840
into some gaming news!

31:36.840 --> 31:37.840
Yay!

31:37.840 --> 31:38.840
Grat!

31:38.840 --> 31:41.880
Alright, we're starting with ding.

31:41.880 --> 31:46.940
So there is some interesting rumors going around about a brand new Wii SKU and everyone's

31:46.940 --> 31:50.120
all like, oh my god, what is this?

31:50.120 --> 31:52.360
It's DVD or something, it's going to be playing.

31:52.360 --> 31:53.360
No, don't get excited.

31:53.360 --> 31:54.880
It's really nothing actually.

31:54.880 --> 32:00.840
The brand new UPC or new pack as it's being dubbed, all it really is, and I've seen this

32:00.840 --> 32:05.720
happen on a few different consoles, it's just them changing the box art.

32:05.720 --> 32:09.920
Basically those launch games, they're a little old and dusty right now, time to put the new

32:09.920 --> 32:13.280
shit on there to get people excited.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.280
That's all it is.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.280
Ooh, box art!

32:15.280 --> 32:16.280
Oh my god!

32:16.280 --> 32:23.880
Because they did the exact same thing in September with the PS2 Slim, they did the same thing

32:23.880 --> 32:34.120
with the PSP, the fat system back in June, and it happens all the time, so just don't

32:34.120 --> 32:35.120
get excited.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.120
Calm down.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.360
If you're getting excited, you're like, oh my god, they're finally going to release the

32:38.360 --> 32:39.360
pink Wii.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.320
You're like, get over it, no.

32:41.320 --> 32:45.740
Trust me, they're not releasing any more colors because they're still not having trouble selling

32:45.740 --> 32:46.840
the original system.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.440
They can't make enough.

32:48.440 --> 32:52.280
When it starts to slow down and people stop buying them, that's when the new colors will

32:52.280 --> 32:53.280
come.

32:53.280 --> 32:56.640
That's like at GameStop, if you buy a new DS, they're giving away a Zelda frame that's

32:56.640 --> 33:00.640
made of cardboard, and I'm like, I have a DS, and he's like, but it's super rare, and

33:00.640 --> 33:03.960
I'm like, so are the $120 to buy a new DS.

33:03.960 --> 33:07.040
Good times.

33:07.040 --> 33:08.340
Not really.

33:08.340 --> 33:10.800
You wanted to punch him, didn't you?

33:10.800 --> 33:14.360
It just depends what GameStop you walk into, because honestly, I walked into a GameStop

33:14.360 --> 33:18.040
once, and I was like, I want to get Elibits, because it came out today, and I hear good

33:18.040 --> 33:19.040
things about it.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.040
I want to buy Elibits.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.240
He's like, did you pre-order it to get the little free stuffed Elibit?

33:22.240 --> 33:25.240
And I was like, no, I didn't, and he said, okay, well, here's one anyway.

33:25.240 --> 33:26.240
I was like, woohoo.

33:26.240 --> 33:29.480
I pre-ordered Phantom Hourglass, and they said, oh yeah, there's a swag bowl of love.

33:29.480 --> 33:30.480
There's no swag for that.

33:30.480 --> 33:31.480
I was like, ah.

33:31.480 --> 33:36.480
Well, I went back to the same store when Eternal Sonata came out, because I neglected to pre-order

33:36.480 --> 33:38.200
that, and I wanted the free faceplate.

33:38.200 --> 33:42.600
So I went in there, and I was like, yes, I'd like to get a copy of Eternal Sonata, and

33:42.600 --> 33:46.280
I was like, oh, I forgot to pre-order, and they were like, oh, well, we have one copy

33:46.280 --> 33:47.280
of the game left.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.280
Here you go.

33:48.280 --> 33:49.280
And I'm like, what about the faceplates?

33:49.280 --> 33:50.280
They're like, does anyone have an iPod?

33:50.280 --> 33:53.960
Because I bet with an Exacto knife, I can make this into an actual skin.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.360
Darkstalker actually got the thing off of the iPod.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.360
Now it's just a piece of plastic.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.360
What?

33:58.360 --> 33:59.360
I didn't get anything.

33:59.360 --> 34:02.960
Wait, no, I'm mixing up the fake radio names, sorry.

34:02.960 --> 34:06.660
I think this is like duct tape.

34:06.660 --> 34:08.760
It's printed duct tape.

34:08.760 --> 34:12.960
This is wonderful radio, you taking apart one of our three little things.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.480
Awesome sounds there doing that.

34:15.480 --> 34:21.360
Well, hey, Eddie, you're very sad that you can't get anything free from buying Zelda.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.600
You can get this as a Wii owner.

34:23.600 --> 34:27.120
Nintendo is now giving away a Wii remote jacket.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.120
That's right.

34:28.120 --> 34:32.160
This week, Nintendo put out a press release that now there's this new sleeve that's coming

34:32.160 --> 34:36.680
out for the Wiimotes, and let me start off by saying it's really ugly.

34:36.680 --> 34:39.000
You know what's better?

34:39.000 --> 34:42.600
Because Nerf did the same thing, and Nerf actually looks cool.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.760
It basically makes your Wiimote look like an Egyptian mummy.

34:45.760 --> 34:53.560
I don't know, I'd say it looks more like they're trying to retard-proof the controller.

34:53.560 --> 34:57.000
Yeah, basically this is so that when you accidentally throw it at your TV because you're an idiot,

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
it will bounce.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.240
Or somebody else is like, so you don't hit people in the head with it.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.240
I'm like, what?

35:01.240 --> 35:05.760
Well, I noticed all the padding is on the front of it, so obviously it's for projectiles

35:05.760 --> 35:08.400
flying against it.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.400
Wow, you'll Wii your eye out.

35:11.400 --> 35:15.400
These are going to be shipped with all new Wii consoles, Wii remotes, and of course copies

35:15.400 --> 35:19.760
of Wii Play, because the Wiimotes come with them, starting October 2nd, and so that means

35:19.760 --> 35:21.400
they should be on shelves by October 15th.

35:21.400 --> 35:22.400
Oh!

35:22.400 --> 35:25.960
Well, maybe that's what the new SKU is then, since it was for October 2nd.

35:25.960 --> 35:26.960
Uh, maybe.

35:26.960 --> 35:31.860
No, but you can go to Nintendo.com, too, and get your own free one.

35:31.860 --> 35:35.760
And then maybe that's the new box art is on the box that says, now with free Egyptian

35:35.760 --> 35:36.760
tombs.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.080
Here's going to be the best part, though, about it.

35:39.080 --> 35:44.040
If it does ship with the Wii console and stuff like that, who's to say someone's actually

35:44.040 --> 35:46.040
going to put it on their Wii remote?

35:46.040 --> 35:49.160
Little shot there of Tutankhamen playing Wii Tennis.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.160
And you know what?

35:50.160 --> 35:55.000
That pretty much killed the market for those stupid Wii gloves now.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.720
Son of Dad wants to know, do the Wii condoms have lubricant on them?

35:58.720 --> 35:59.720
Yes.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.920
No, but they are ribbed for her pleasure.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.000
Have these Wiimotes inspired some type of new sick fetish?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
That's disgusting.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Oh yeah.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
What's wrong with you people?

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
Alright.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Uh, let's see, what else do we have here?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Wii-o-preenism?

36:10.000 --> 36:14.440
Um, apparently you can actually go to Nintendo.com, or you can give this number a call.

36:14.440 --> 36:22.000
In fact, call it right now, see what happens, 1-866-431-8367 to place your order.

36:22.000 --> 36:26.640
You can order them now, but the free sleeves won't ship until the week of October 15th.

36:26.640 --> 36:30.580
Make sure to ask for them to be ribbed.

36:30.580 --> 36:32.440
For her pleasure.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.760
I want them ribbed for my pleasure, please.

36:35.760 --> 36:41.060
Hold on a minute here.

36:41.060 --> 36:43.760
Can somebody go grab my Wii so I can get the serial number off it?

36:43.760 --> 36:44.920
I don't know if anybody's actually going to answer.

36:44.920 --> 36:48.560

Thank you for calling Nintendo Consumer Services, this is

Did you already go online and try or is this your first attempt?

37:29.240 --> 37:30.240
This is my first attempt.

37:30.240 --> 37:35.960
It said I could call the number.

37:35.960 --> 37:39.440
I was just checking because we have quite a few people who tried online and had some

37:39.440 --> 37:40.440
difficulties.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.440
That's why I was...

37:41.440 --> 37:42.440
Ah, forget it.

37:42.440 --> 37:43.440
I'm not going to bother with her.

37:43.440 --> 37:44.440
That's so mean.

37:44.440 --> 37:45.440
Just go put this back.

37:45.440 --> 37:46.440
She's going to belittle me?

37:46.440 --> 37:58.000
Well, sir, I've got like the stupid type, so I don't have a chance.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.200
What's wrong with you, moron?

38:00.200 --> 38:05.360
Why don't you go on the website?

38:05.360 --> 38:16.480
At least we know it works, though.

38:16.480 --> 38:17.480
The whole chat room.

38:17.480 --> 38:18.480
Let's see.

38:18.480 --> 38:20.680
Drunami says, don't fucking disrespect the call center rep.

38:20.680 --> 38:21.680
I'm not.

38:21.680 --> 38:22.680
Okay.

38:22.680 --> 38:23.680
You know what, Rob?

38:23.680 --> 38:24.680
You know what, Rob?

38:24.680 --> 38:25.680
What?

38:25.680 --> 38:26.680
I worked in a call center for five years.

38:26.680 --> 38:27.680
Yes.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.680
Yeah.

38:28.680 --> 38:29.680
Don't disrespect the call center rep.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.680
I'm not.

38:30.680 --> 38:31.680
I trained for a call center.

38:31.680 --> 38:32.680
I'm not disrespecting.

38:32.680 --> 38:33.680
That is disrespectful.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.600
What's the point if you tried online or not?

38:36.600 --> 38:37.600
Did you try online?

38:37.600 --> 38:40.080
Because really, I don't want to help you right now.

38:40.080 --> 38:44.840
If you could just try online, that would make my life a whole lot easier so I wouldn't have

38:44.840 --> 38:45.840
to do my job.

38:45.840 --> 38:48.680
I often do stuff like that because when you work in a call center, you usually have a

38:48.680 --> 38:51.760
time limit on how long you can take a call or else you get written up.

38:51.760 --> 38:52.760
Hey, Rob.

38:52.760 --> 38:53.760
Hey, Mike Lit.

38:53.760 --> 38:54.760
All right.

38:54.760 --> 38:55.760
Wonder.Carol said that call center rep was actually nice.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.760
She was, but she was totally...

38:56.760 --> 38:57.760
No.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.760
Well, she gave you explanations.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.120
They probably make her ask that.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.120
It was scripted.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.120
Yeah.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.120
You can tell what scripting sounds like.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.120
Yeah.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.120
All right.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.120
Rob.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.120
Yeah.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.120
Yeah.

39:08.120 --> 39:09.120
All right.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.120
Let's just move on with the show already.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.680
First of all, Rob, never give me kettle corn again.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.360
It's got cocaine in it.

39:14.360 --> 39:20.760
So anyway, virtual console for the UK if anyone's interested, and the first one makes me just

39:20.760 --> 39:26.240
totally go WTF even though I actually own the original of this game.

39:26.240 --> 39:29.360
Fatal Fury for Neo Geo, 900 Wii points.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.360
Whoa.

39:30.360 --> 39:34.080
Next to nine euro, 675 pound.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.880
Yeah.

39:35.880 --> 39:37.720
It's a Neo Geo game.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.040
It's Fatal Fury.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.040
Next.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.200
Hey, look.

39:41.200 --> 39:45.560
Streets of Rage 3, which is actually a pretty good game.

39:45.560 --> 39:46.560
I like this.

39:46.560 --> 39:51.920
I miss the old beat them up games like that, although nothing was ever as awesome as Battletoads

39:51.920 --> 39:55.400
and Double Dragon.

39:55.400 --> 40:02.360
Then moving forward, as soon as it decides to load, Golden Axe 3 at 800 Wii points, which

40:02.360 --> 40:08.640
was also, as it was known in the UK, Sega Mega Drive, which for us was the Genesis.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.180
And remember, Genesis does what Nintendo don't.

40:12.180 --> 40:17.920
And also another Mega Drive game for 800 Wii points, Super Thunder Blade, which actually

40:17.920 --> 40:20.400
wasn't all that fun.

40:20.400 --> 40:26.480
And last but not least, Land Stalker, the Treasure of the King Knoll, no Treasure of

40:26.480 --> 40:31.360
King Knoll, another Mega Drive game, which I don't actually think was fun either.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.960
End of story.

40:33.960 --> 40:34.960
Alright.

40:34.960 --> 40:35.960
Anyways.

40:35.960 --> 40:42.920
So, some day, there will be some more titles for the WiiWare service, because right now

40:42.920 --> 40:48.680
all there is is a couple channels for the Wii, but one title promised for early 2008

40:48.680 --> 40:56.080
is going to be a game called Gravitronics, being put out by developer Metaverse.

40:56.080 --> 41:01.080
And it's going to be a game, I guess, supporting up to eight players, and I guess it's going

41:01.080 --> 41:04.800
to be assaulting enemy territories using shapes.

41:04.800 --> 41:05.800
Sweet.

41:05.800 --> 41:07.720
So, death by shapes.

41:07.720 --> 41:11.320
What is the deal with that whole, because I'm, speaking as a Nintendo fanboy, they were

41:11.320 --> 41:15.180
supposed to have all this stuff ready to go at launch.

41:15.180 --> 41:19.200
And it's like a year later, they're still doing three games a week, and there's like

41:19.200 --> 41:22.200
literally hundreds of games between these three systems.

41:22.200 --> 41:26.680
Or Eddie, did you try going online and filling out the form to ask the question, because

41:26.680 --> 41:27.680
I should, huh?

41:27.680 --> 41:29.720
I should call them up and be like, bitch!

41:29.720 --> 41:30.720
Well, okay.

41:30.720 --> 41:35.920
Here's one thing that, a lot of the games, first off, weren't rated by the ESRB, so a

41:35.920 --> 41:37.400
lot of those had to go through that again.

41:37.400 --> 41:43.280
A lot of them also, they have to be made to work with the emulators, and stuff like that.

41:43.280 --> 41:46.440
And then also, they don't give a fuck what you care!

41:46.440 --> 41:48.120
They're just like, we're fucking Nintendo!

41:48.120 --> 41:49.840
You can't buy our fucking system!

41:49.840 --> 41:51.480
Why the fuck do you want to get online anyways?

41:51.480 --> 41:54.920
You need to get your fucking system first before you can get fucking online!

41:54.920 --> 41:55.920
No I know the semantics, but.

41:55.920 --> 41:58.720
I don't think you should do a free fuck that much, they'll probably make up their own words.

41:58.720 --> 41:59.720
Like fiddlesticks.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.720
Anyway.

42:00.720 --> 42:01.720
What the fuck?

42:01.720 --> 42:07.480
No, really, what it comes down to is that they're just dragging their fucking feet until

42:07.480 --> 42:10.040
they can get shit done.

42:10.040 --> 42:15.120
Where's this WiiWare service that's supposed to be coming out years from now, I mean seriously,

42:15.120 --> 42:16.120
when's it coming out?

42:16.120 --> 42:17.120
We want some actual games.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.920
How about better online service altogether?

42:18.920 --> 42:19.920
Exactly.

42:19.920 --> 42:20.920
Actually support online.

42:20.920 --> 42:21.920
Nintendo online?

42:21.920 --> 42:22.920
Exactly.

42:22.920 --> 42:27.520
It's such a scary world, that online out there, I mean.

42:27.520 --> 42:31.720
No cause you know, the upper browser's awesome, I like doing that on my TV, but there's really

42:31.720 --> 42:33.960
nothing else for Nintendo online, it's like, ahh!

42:33.960 --> 42:35.960
I mean there should be.

42:35.960 --> 42:40.160
I can't believe it's taken them this long to even come this close to being online, given

42:40.160 --> 42:45.100
that we've had the internet since you know, the late 70s, that you know, the government

42:45.100 --> 42:46.100
used it.

42:46.100 --> 42:49.440
They are seriously scared of like lawsuits, I think that's what it's coming down to because

42:49.440 --> 42:53.240
they're afraid if they make an online service that there's going to be some kid that's going

42:53.240 --> 42:58.320
to get lured by some rapist or something, and then oh my god, Nintendo caused the kid

42:58.320 --> 42:59.320
to get raped.

42:59.320 --> 43:00.320
Oh no.

43:00.320 --> 43:04.040
Just like the fucking um, Wii jacket shit, I mean there's no reason that they need to

43:04.040 --> 43:05.040
improve stuff.

43:05.040 --> 43:09.400
They really see idiotic people throwing shit through their god damn TV, and now you have

43:09.400 --> 43:15.520
this like stupid like foam shit on the like fucking remote that's going to, I guess, protect

43:15.520 --> 43:16.520
your TV.

43:16.520 --> 43:17.520
No.

43:17.520 --> 43:18.520
The hell it will.

43:18.520 --> 43:21.960
People will find more ways to do this, until this like stupid thing that the Wii's going

43:21.960 --> 43:27.440
to sit in, the remote, it's going to be like this giant foam protective thing that's going

43:27.440 --> 43:30.640
to look like you're waving around a giant retarded glove or something.

43:30.640 --> 43:36.400
I mean seriously, there are idiotic people, they just need to get over that fact and just

43:36.400 --> 43:37.680
start making better shit.

43:37.680 --> 43:40.880
How should Nintendo be responsible for somebody else's idiocy?

43:40.880 --> 43:44.440
There's no amount of like protection that they're going to be able to give for these

43:44.440 --> 43:48.320
remotes to cause people not to break the tag.

43:48.320 --> 43:50.360
I love the tag, you should actually hold on to the Wiimote.

43:50.360 --> 43:56.420
Is that even if somebody does, you know, completely disregard an instruction that is blatantly

43:56.420 --> 43:57.840
written on the product?

43:57.840 --> 44:01.480
Like five minutes before every game starts, it's like, be careful, the Wiimote, ah.

44:01.480 --> 44:05.080
Well, I have an example for you and this doesn't necessarily have to do with a video game,

44:05.080 --> 44:13.160
but this is a primary example of how somebody can still basically bypass an entire law to

44:13.160 --> 44:17.520
get money out of a company is there was a, and I studied this in my business law class,

44:17.520 --> 44:20.940
so this is back to business law.

44:20.940 --> 44:25.760
This person had a weed whacker and it said children under the age of so and such should

44:25.760 --> 44:30.920
not be allowed anywhere near it, do not swing it back, do not do this, the company is not

44:30.920 --> 44:33.120
responsible if this is the circumstance.

44:33.120 --> 44:37.500
Well, this kid was following his uncle around following this weed whacker and it bounced

44:37.500 --> 44:41.320
off of a rock, which was not a fault of the machine, it was physics.

44:41.320 --> 44:44.880
Reach back and cut off this kid's leg.

44:44.880 --> 44:52.340
And all of the things led up that it was operator error.

44:52.340 --> 44:55.440
It was full operator error, it was not the fault of the product and they disregarded

44:55.440 --> 44:56.440
all the things.

44:56.440 --> 45:01.080
However, they managed to get somewhere close to two million out of the company.

45:01.080 --> 45:05.040
And so I use that as my primary example, you know, if Nintendo wants to be careful then

45:05.040 --> 45:09.180
more power to them, you know, because they're going to find ways to bleed them dry if something

45:09.180 --> 45:10.180
like that happened.

45:10.180 --> 45:11.180
All right.

45:11.180 --> 45:14.400
In the interest of keeping the show under four hours tonight, we've got to move on to

45:14.400 --> 45:15.400
the next story.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.600
All lots of good points tonight, but we've got to keep it moving.

45:17.600 --> 45:22.080
When we talk about Halo DS, a lot of folks when they first heard about this game, this

45:22.080 --> 45:27.240
has got to be a bunch of bullshit, but this video came out this week that actually shows

45:27.240 --> 45:28.240
Halo DS in action.

45:28.240 --> 45:29.240
Listen to those noises there.

45:29.240 --> 45:38.220
It actually looks like Zanzibar there, somebody's getting shot the F up there in Zanzibar.

45:38.220 --> 45:41.460
So people are like, OMG, Halo DS was real at one point.

45:41.460 --> 45:44.360
This whole video came out from an IGN blog.

45:44.360 --> 45:49.240
Now here's the thing though, is that actually what happened is that apparently somebody

45:49.240 --> 45:54.820
was actually modifying an engine of another game to show that Halo DS could be done and

45:54.820 --> 46:00.000
Halo DS could be ported, and it was something that come as an idea like, hey, why don't

46:00.000 --> 46:05.040
you let us develop a DS port of Halo, to which the answer was a resounding no.

46:05.040 --> 46:09.160
Because of course, you know, at the time Bungie and Microsoft, you know, had their thing.

46:09.160 --> 46:10.160
And Halo's boring.

46:10.160 --> 46:13.960
Well, Halo's the only, you know, only on Microsoft consoles.

46:13.960 --> 46:15.480
So it couldn't really come to DS.

46:15.480 --> 46:18.320
Of course, as we're going to learn about a little later in the program, maybe now it's

46:18.320 --> 46:21.880
a possibility, but somehow I kind of doubt it.

46:21.880 --> 46:25.440
I mean the port, hey, props to the port though, the port looked pretty nice, I got to say.

46:25.440 --> 46:27.360
So that's that.

46:27.360 --> 46:32.400
You know, I actually, if they did it, I think that I would actually pay for it, honestly.

46:32.400 --> 46:36.120
If it had Wi-Fi network, it might be pretty cool and have the same multiplayer capabilities.

46:36.120 --> 46:39.920
That's what I think, although honestly, you know, I just wish for Duke Nukem 3D on DS.

46:39.920 --> 46:40.920
Heck yeah.

46:40.920 --> 46:43.840
Along with the text, with the voice macros.

46:43.840 --> 46:47.160
No, they do not need Duke Nukem 3D on the DS, they need to fucking finish Duke Nukem

46:47.160 --> 46:49.240
Forever and stop making excuses.

46:49.240 --> 46:53.600
Yeah, they're going to hold that over our heads like a carrot in front of a horse, so...

46:53.600 --> 46:56.040
That's fine, I've got Forever to wait for this damn game.

46:56.040 --> 46:57.040
They better come out.

46:57.040 --> 46:58.320
I don't care if it's going to suck.

46:58.320 --> 47:03.120
Well, for anyone who was looking forward to Super Smash Brothers Brawl, guess who's going

47:03.120 --> 47:05.000
to be in it?

47:05.000 --> 47:10.960
Lucas from Mother 3, which is about the same thing as us getting, you know, Roy when the

47:10.960 --> 47:15.960
last Smash Brothers came out because we didn't have any Fire Emblem then, so whatever.

47:15.960 --> 47:18.480
And now we're getting Ike, and now we're getting Lucas.

47:18.480 --> 47:21.600
So maybe they're going to go, oh, well let's pull a Fire Emblem and finally give them Mother

47:21.600 --> 47:23.600
3 since it's already in English!

47:23.600 --> 47:24.600
Nope.

47:24.600 --> 47:29.040
I'm just going to have to import my copy from the UK.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.040
Nope.

47:30.040 --> 47:34.520
Although I think that it's funny that Joystiq did a comparison between Lucas and Mother

47:34.520 --> 47:38.300
3 and Lucas and the Wizard.

47:38.300 --> 47:42.580
As long as Lucas still has the ability to do PK Fire and PK Cross and all that cheap

47:42.580 --> 47:44.440
bullshit then I'll be very happy.

47:44.440 --> 47:48.600
They should be one of those wireless communicators with Super Smash Brothers.

47:48.600 --> 47:51.720
Your mic is going crazy, Eddie, so we're going to unplug it and you're going to have to borrow

47:51.720 --> 47:55.000
one of the other mics from now on because the chat room is complaining about you.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
It's cutting in and out.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
They can't hear it.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
They can't hear it.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
You have to use another mic.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
It's on.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
This was on a commission.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
Oh, darn.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
Sorry, Eddie.

48:03.000 --> 48:10.360
Anyways, in other news, the Wii is not going to meet the demand for this holiday.

48:10.360 --> 48:15.840
So in case you were waiting for some magical delivery of Wii systems that was going to

48:15.840 --> 48:20.880
be able to put out millions and millions of units in the United States, think again, it's

48:20.880 --> 48:21.880
not going to happen.

48:21.880 --> 48:27.640
Reggie actually kind of originally claimed that there was going to be plenty of units

48:27.640 --> 48:33.440
out there but then went back to retract that statement and of course they're trying to

48:33.440 --> 48:39.200
up the quantities coming to the United States but still they're not going to be able to

48:39.200 --> 48:41.000
make it.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.840
I guess that's good that they're selling units.

48:42.840 --> 48:48.680
I think it's so crappy though that after a year of being out, they can't fucking produce

48:48.680 --> 48:50.000
more of these.

48:50.000 --> 48:59.680
I don't think that there's anything in them that's really that revolutionary.

48:59.680 --> 49:01.340
If you can find one, buy one.

49:01.340 --> 49:06.640
That's probably the recommendation, especially if you want to get one for Christmas.

49:06.640 --> 49:12.560
Hopefully there won't be all the camping out and everything that people have to do again

49:12.560 --> 49:13.560
this time.

49:13.560 --> 49:18.000
That would be kind of sucky, I don't know.

49:18.000 --> 49:24.520
There's been some titles announced for the Neo Geo ports on the Virtual Console because

49:24.520 --> 49:29.000
as you know, the Virtual Console is now going to be getting some Neo Geo games on it.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.540
One of the first games that's going to come out is Fatal Fury.

49:32.540 --> 49:37.700
Fatal Fury is only going to set you back $9, which is amazing when you consider that there's

49:37.700 --> 49:41.160
Fatal Fury Special on Xbox Live Arcade with extra stuff for $5.

49:41.160 --> 49:45.120
Yeah, but then again, I paid about $100 for the cart.

49:45.120 --> 49:47.700
So I guess everybody's getting a bargain in that case.

49:47.700 --> 49:53.100
Also you can look forward to upcoming other SNK fighting classics, World Heroes and Art

49:53.100 --> 49:54.440
of Fighting.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.920
And Art of Fighting was great because it has a character named after me.

49:56.920 --> 50:02.520
There's actually a Robert in the game, so I definitely recommend Art of Fighting.

50:02.520 --> 50:03.520
Good times.

50:03.520 --> 50:04.720
And it has that zoom in and out.

50:04.720 --> 50:05.720
And it has King.

50:05.720 --> 50:06.720
Hello.

50:06.720 --> 50:07.720
It does have King.

50:07.720 --> 50:08.720
King's hot.

50:08.720 --> 50:09.720
Who doesn't love King?

50:09.720 --> 50:10.720
King has a tux.

50:10.720 --> 50:11.720
She does.

50:11.720 --> 50:12.720
I know it's great.

50:12.720 --> 50:19.480
It said in her boobs, come out when you knock her out.

50:19.480 --> 50:25.800
Well other potential title coming out on the Virtual Console, at least the ESRB's put out

50:25.800 --> 50:33.320
ratings for it, is we have Echo Junior and Eternal Champions, which I love Eternal Champions,

50:33.320 --> 50:36.840
but I like Eternal Champions CD better with the Cinekills.

50:36.840 --> 50:38.520
That was so great.

50:38.520 --> 50:43.960
Sonic 3D Blast and Light Crusader also have ratings out on them.

50:43.960 --> 50:45.800
So yeah.

50:45.800 --> 50:46.800
Hooray.

50:46.800 --> 50:48.760
I want Vectorman.

50:48.760 --> 50:50.680
Oh my God, Vectorman.

50:50.680 --> 50:55.200
Well there's plenty other stuff coming out in the US this week.

50:55.200 --> 51:02.240
This week we're going to see releases of such wonderfully average games as Looney Tunes

51:02.240 --> 51:09.160
Acme Arsenal coming out on PlayStation 2, 360 and the Wii, Looney Tunes Duck Amuck on

51:09.160 --> 51:17.960
the DS, Mountain Bike Adrenaline, a game that's attempting to make mountain biking extreme

51:17.960 --> 51:18.960
or something.

51:18.960 --> 51:21.480
It's coming out on PlayStation 2.

51:21.480 --> 51:29.340
Honda SBK07, Superbike also coming out on PlayStation 2 and Backyard Football 2008.

51:29.340 --> 51:31.840
Why the fuck do they still make more of those games?

51:31.840 --> 51:35.160
Because they all suck.

51:35.160 --> 51:41.800
Also coming out this week on the DS, Jackass, which I recommend that one because it's awesome.

51:41.800 --> 51:45.800
FIFA Soccer 08 coming out on almost every single platform.

51:45.800 --> 51:51.000
On Xbox 360, Half Life 2, the Orange Box is going to be making its way out and also on

51:51.000 --> 51:54.400
the PC that will be coming out as well.

51:54.400 --> 52:00.360
Sega Rally Revo on Xbox 360, PS3 and PSP.

52:00.360 --> 52:05.980
And let's see, on the Wii, Bleach the Shattered Blade is coming out and also there's a Bleach

52:05.980 --> 52:08.920
game coming out on the DS as well.

52:08.920 --> 52:09.920
Bleach No.

52:09.920 --> 52:13.140
Yes, the Blade of Fate coming out.

52:13.140 --> 52:17.600
Let's see here, Flipper Critters on the DS.

52:17.600 --> 52:22.560
Smash Detective 2.5, that one might be pretty interesting.

52:22.560 --> 52:32.400
Let's see here, also on PC we're getting Thrillville off the rails and on, let's see here, the

52:32.400 --> 52:34.560
Wii Mercury Meltdown Revolution.

52:34.560 --> 52:36.240
I believe that's everything.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.900
Oh, Folklore on the PS3.

52:37.900 --> 52:39.760
That one's actually looking like a pretty good game.

52:39.760 --> 52:43.640
It's gotten some pretty decent reviews as well.

52:43.640 --> 52:49.360
And Final Fantasy Tactics, War of the Lions coming out on the PSP.

52:49.360 --> 52:51.520
Ooh, that's supposed to be a good one.

52:51.520 --> 52:52.520
I'm looking forward to that.

52:52.520 --> 52:56.960
And then the last one, let's see here, Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron on PSP

52:56.960 --> 52:57.960
as well.

52:57.960 --> 52:58.960
Good times.

52:58.960 --> 52:59.960
I do believe that's everything.

52:59.960 --> 53:03.440
Well, let's go over to Japan and check out the upcoming release dates over in Japan for

53:03.440 --> 53:08.640
this week on October 11th on the Xbox 360, Project Gotham Racing 4.

53:08.640 --> 53:11.560
We just got that over here this last week and now over here in Japan you get to check

53:11.560 --> 53:12.920
that out this week.

53:12.920 --> 53:17.680
And coming out on the PlayStation 3, Rise from Lair, which I believe is just their version

53:17.680 --> 53:22.040
of Lair, is coming out on October 11th as well.

53:22.040 --> 53:25.560
Also on the PlayStation 3, The Godfather, the Dawn's Edition.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.960
So if you're a fan of The Godfather in Japan, you get that.

53:27.960 --> 53:36.000
You've got to love this on the PlayStation 2, Colorful Aquarium, My Little Mermaid.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
This is not...

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Dating sim.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.100
Yeah, this looks like some type of dating sim or something.

53:40.100 --> 53:44.080
This is not some aquarium like Tetris Splash or whatever.

53:44.080 --> 53:45.600
It's just a bunch of...

53:45.600 --> 53:46.600
It's a maid fetish game.

53:46.600 --> 53:48.400
Yeah, it's anime girls and maid costumes.

53:48.400 --> 53:49.400
There you go.

53:49.400 --> 53:50.400
With kitty ears.

53:50.400 --> 53:51.400
Exactly.

53:51.400 --> 53:52.400
You know.

53:52.400 --> 53:53.400
You know what we need wrong?

53:53.400 --> 53:54.400
Otaku Boys Fap Away.

53:54.400 --> 53:55.400
We need another Tokimeki Memorial.

53:55.400 --> 53:56.400
Well, maybe you will someday.

53:56.400 --> 53:59.360
Coming out on the DS, Namco Museum DS with the letter N.

53:59.360 --> 54:00.360
Do what?

54:00.360 --> 54:03.840
With the letter N. How many freaking Namco Museum things do you have?

54:03.840 --> 54:05.280
Do you need another one on the DS?

54:05.280 --> 54:06.280
Yes.

54:06.280 --> 54:07.280
Do you?

54:07.280 --> 54:11.360
There's a DVD of these that's like every single Namco game ever made.

54:11.360 --> 54:12.360
For real.

54:12.360 --> 54:13.520
Looks like there's kind of a cool new version of Pac-Man on there.

54:13.520 --> 54:15.360
I don't know if that's Pac-Man Versus or what the hell it is.

54:15.360 --> 54:16.360
That is Pac-Man Versus.

54:16.360 --> 54:17.360
Is that really?

54:17.360 --> 54:18.360
Look at that.

54:18.360 --> 54:20.160
That's all right there on the Namco Museum of the DS.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.320
Good times.

54:21.320 --> 54:27.240
Also coming out on the DS, Tecmo is putting this game out and it looks like, I don't know,

54:27.240 --> 54:29.760
some type of like spy game or something there.

54:29.760 --> 54:30.760
I don't know if it's a point and click.

54:30.760 --> 54:31.880
Yeah, it might be a point and clicker.

54:31.880 --> 54:32.880
I'm not sure.

54:32.880 --> 54:33.880
But here's the name of it.

54:33.880 --> 54:43.920
DS Nishimura Kitoro Suspense Shintante Series Kyoto Atami Zekai no Kotou Satsui no Wanna.

54:43.920 --> 54:47.400
I no Wanna that game.

54:47.400 --> 54:52.760
I was looking at that and thinking of Snatcher.

54:52.760 --> 54:56.160
I don't know if it takes longer to beat the game or pronounce the title.

54:56.160 --> 54:59.400
So it's all right there.

54:59.400 --> 55:03.320
And on the Sony PSP, some movies come out for those of you guys that are still in the

55:03.320 --> 55:08.120
UMDs in Japan and you can buy this week on October 12th, Lady in the Water.

55:08.120 --> 55:10.960
Yes, the M. Night Shyamalan classic.

55:10.960 --> 55:14.560
And you can ogle those scrunts right there on the PlayStation 3.

55:14.560 --> 55:16.520
Hey, how about some more?

55:16.520 --> 55:23.640
That's the sound that I make when I'm taking Lady in the Water.

55:23.640 --> 55:26.120
Leaving sacrifices for the Lady in the Water.

55:26.120 --> 55:27.120
Wow.

55:27.120 --> 55:29.920
So shall I continue with the UK releases?

55:29.920 --> 55:34.480
Actually, really quickly, Alpha Canagram says, Skye, that is the Pac-Man that Miyamoto helped

55:34.480 --> 55:35.520
work on.

55:35.520 --> 55:37.600
So that's like the, I guess, newer Pac-Man game.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.680
Oh, in that case, let me buy another Pac-Man game.

55:40.680 --> 55:41.680
Whoo!

55:41.680 --> 55:43.960
That ain't stopped us.

55:43.960 --> 55:53.600
So on the 12th in the UK, Bliss Creek 2 Liberation on PC, Crash of the Titans on Xbox 360, Deadhead

55:53.600 --> 56:00.320
Fred on PSP, Donkey Kong Jungle Climber on DS, Folklore on PlayStation 3, Half-Life 2

56:00.320 --> 56:06.400
Episode 2, Heroes of Might and Magic 5, Tribes of the East, NBA Live 08, Portal, Project

56:06.400 --> 56:14.560
Gotham Racing 4, Race 07, the official WTCC game, whatever that is, Skate on PlayStation

56:14.560 --> 56:20.080
3, Spider-Man Friend or Foe, which I'm actually kind of looking forward to, Star Wars Battlefront

56:20.080 --> 56:27.840
Renegade Squadron on PSP, TAR Chronicles on PC, Team Fortress 2, and the Orange Box.

56:27.840 --> 56:29.080
I think I forgot to mention one.

56:29.080 --> 56:34.040
I think this week also Donkey Kong Bongo Blast is coming out on the Wii.

56:34.040 --> 56:36.800
I don't know if anyone should get excited about a game that was supposed to be on the

56:36.800 --> 56:41.960
GameCube featuring the Bongos and now is on the Wii because we needed another Wii game

56:41.960 --> 56:44.040
and it's a racing game.

56:44.040 --> 56:46.140
I'm excited.

56:46.140 --> 56:47.140
I tried.

56:47.140 --> 56:48.140
I tried, guys.

56:48.140 --> 56:49.140
I tried.

56:49.140 --> 56:50.160
I tried.

56:50.160 --> 56:51.160
I tried.

56:51.160 --> 56:52.160
I tried.

56:52.160 --> 56:53.160
Anyways.

56:53.160 --> 56:57.500
No, seriously though, there are some other interesting things happening including more

56:57.500 --> 56:59.600
Guitar Hero tracks being revealed.

56:59.600 --> 57:04.000
I swear to God there's no surprise when you go play Guitar Hero 3 nowadays, which by the

57:04.000 --> 57:08.900
way this is how Activision keeps Guitar Hero in the news every week and it's worked successfully.

57:08.900 --> 57:11.040
Every week there's some damn Guitar Hero 3 update.

57:11.040 --> 57:14.920
Well, there's only a couple more weeks until, you know, this game comes out, so.

57:14.920 --> 57:20.780
But there is some good stuff being announced, When You Were Young by The Killers, Same Old

57:20.780 --> 57:27.840
Song and Dance by Aerosmith, Helicopter by Block Party, Strichen by Disturbed, let's

57:27.840 --> 57:34.000
see here, Devil Went Down to Georgia, which I think that was on that leaked list as...

57:34.000 --> 57:35.800
I wonder if all these songs are on the leaked list.

57:35.800 --> 57:42.080
Yeah, so, ooh, maybe that leaked list is real, yeah, okay.

57:42.080 --> 57:50.780
Black Magic Woman by Santana, Hit Me With Your Best Shot by Pat Benatar, and The Seeker

57:50.780 --> 57:53.380
by The Who, and some other shit, so.

57:53.380 --> 57:55.280
Hit me with a wet sock.

57:55.280 --> 57:56.280
Come on!

57:56.280 --> 58:06.120
I don't know, it's how we used to sing it at karaoke.

58:06.120 --> 58:07.120
Me and my imaginary...

58:07.120 --> 58:11.200
Irene, don't say things if you don't have a microphone, seriously.

58:11.200 --> 58:13.960
You ruin the experience for the podcast listeners.

58:13.960 --> 58:16.960
Us as studio are amused.

58:16.960 --> 58:19.760
Anything else you want to announce on Guitar Hero 3?

58:19.760 --> 58:21.320
Nope.

58:21.320 --> 58:25.080
It's coming out on the 28th, in case you haven't heard, and that's a Sunday.

58:25.080 --> 58:26.080
Hooray.

58:26.080 --> 58:30.640
No, but seriously though, they're going to have to keep all the attention that they can

58:30.640 --> 58:35.600
possibly get, because about a month after that is when Rock Band comes out, and then,

58:35.600 --> 58:37.180
I don't know.

58:37.180 --> 58:41.240
You know, a friend of mine used to sing it on stage once, with me with your big cock.

58:41.240 --> 58:42.240
Come on!

58:42.240 --> 58:43.880
Is that your grandma too?

58:43.880 --> 58:46.920
No, that was not my grandma, you fucking bastard.

58:46.920 --> 58:51.800
Why is it funny when I read this?

58:51.800 --> 58:52.800
Alright.

58:52.800 --> 58:53.800
Alright.

58:53.800 --> 58:57.120
Anyhow, um, moving on.

58:57.120 --> 59:00.520
I will probably not be playing too much of Guitar Hero 3, because I'm too busy being

59:00.520 --> 59:05.040
addicted to MMOs, and one MMO that maybe I should really check out sometime, because

59:05.040 --> 59:08.320
I've heard a lot of things about it, City of Heroes.

59:08.320 --> 59:13.760
City of Heroes is actually going to be getting a new update called A Stitch in Time, where

59:13.760 --> 59:19.720
the heroes will get to go into a new universe, and get to relive some of the major events

59:19.720 --> 59:24.640
that have happened in the past to shape Paragon City, which is where all the City Heroes folks

59:24.640 --> 59:25.640
live.

59:25.640 --> 59:29.200
Oh my god, such a ripoff of Final Fantasy XI.

59:29.200 --> 59:33.860
Not really, because this is, no, no, I say no, because this is letting them relive events

59:33.860 --> 59:35.360
that, you know, the game's been on for years.

59:35.360 --> 59:36.360
I'm just kidding, I'm not serious.

59:36.360 --> 59:37.360
Both of them suck.

59:37.360 --> 59:38.360
Oh, okay, thank god.

59:38.360 --> 59:41.480
Yeah, like they're the first people to ever think of, you know, going back in time, seriously.

59:41.480 --> 59:46.000
There will be new power sets, including dual blades, willpower, new customization, weapons,

59:46.000 --> 59:47.840
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

59:47.840 --> 59:50.200
City of Heroes fans are excited, I'm sure.

59:50.200 --> 59:53.640
However, I still have not checked out City of Heroes, but I've heard good things about

59:53.640 --> 59:54.640
Chat.

59:54.640 --> 59:55.640
Chat room, tell me about City of Heroes.

59:55.640 --> 59:56.640
Any of you guys play it?

59:56.640 --> 59:58.980
If so, what am I missing?

59:58.980 --> 01:00:05.080
I think that it's got, like, this thing where, um, I think it has, like, some sort of rotating

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.800
experience thing.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800
I don't know.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.920
I think the best part of that game would be creating your character.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.160
I could see myself sitting there for an hour in the create your character mode, and then

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.160
that's it.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.400
And then at the end, Stan Lee remakes your costume.

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.260
Yeah, exactly.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.260
And I get dismissed.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:26.640
I have to throw away my costume, because I'm not a true superhero, because I tried to kick

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.640
the baby.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:34.640
Well, in other MMORPG news, and we all know that MMORPG means Many Men Online Roleplaying

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:39.920
Girls, for those who are playing World of Warcraft, which I am not numbered among you

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:46.840
since my computer died, I am playing better games, well, they have done their own version

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:52.840
of Oktoberfest in World of Warcraft, Brewfest, which is really what Oktoberfest should be

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:58.320
called anyway, don't you think, where you can run around in Lederhosen and eat pretzels

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.120
in game.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.000
And listen to German Polka, which is awesome.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.360
You know what makes it even better is if you actually have significant amounts of alcohol

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.540
there with you at your computer.

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:10.720
You can actually get these things from little Brewfest vendors, and if you drink them, they

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.400
actually give you buffs, they're useful items, but then they make your screen all wavy, and

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.400
like, it fucks with you.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.600
Like, if you have a, you know, if, what, oh god, here comes Irene.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.160
How long have you been playing WoW?

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.920
Because they have alcoholic drinks, like, from the inn.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.680
No, but this one's different, like, instead of making your screen blurry, this one made

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.480
my screen, like, pulsate, it was really weird.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.000
Like, I've only ever drank the alcoholic drinks that make the screen blurry, and then they

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
blur more and more as you drink them.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.200
Isn't that kind of sad, people that, like, drink alcohol in-game, it's like, I'm too

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.200
scared to try it in my life.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.620
Well, everybody tries it once, I mean, come on.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.620
In-game, like.

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:43.620
Well, yeah, because you want to see what your character's like drunk.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:47.080
Like, is this what it's really like, I'm never drinking ever again, like, that's pretty

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.080
sad.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:53.320
No, I'll tell you what happens when you really drink in real life, is you get a bright idea

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.960
to form an internet radio program with your friends, and then you can't escape it for

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.600
over 250 weekly episodes.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.880
No, no, Rob, that's when you're bored on the Bart.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.280
No, when you get, when you get drunk, you marry Irene.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.600
No, no, no, that's, no, that's a joke.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.800
Eddie tells a funny joke and gets a test paper score.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.800
That's a joke.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800
That's a joke from a party.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.240
Well, that's just funny after a conversation.

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.840
No, Irene got married at a party when this guy was drunk, so.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.800
Yeah, his name's William.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:19.800
Okay.

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.800
And he's Asian.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.400
Um, totally random sidebar conversation, it has nothing to do with gaming, but it needs

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.400
to be told.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:29.680
Um, Jamie and I last night went to a movie, we went and saw that across the universe.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.680
It was great.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:31.680
The thing would be, you know, it was okay.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.680
It had good parts.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.320
But I didn't like the whole thing.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.320
Whatever.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.320
It's like a quilt.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.320
Some sections are nice, but the whole thing is ugly.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.480
He gave it the Xanadu rating, okay?

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.680
Yeah, okay, anyway.

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:43.560
That's not what we were talking about, but on the drive home, somehow the topic of going

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.560
to Vegas came up.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.560
Who was always in the car?

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.560
It was me, my roommate, my boyfriend, and you, right?

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.560
My roommate.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.560
Yeah, my roommate.

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:49.560
Our roommate is a doll in the car.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.560
And John.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:51.560
Yeah, my roommate.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.560
John.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.280
We were in the car, and we were taking about going to Vegas and wanting to go to Vegas.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.400
And we were talking about wanting to talk about... Because you know how like everybody's

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.100
all... I think the topic of Britney Spears came up.

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:02.380
Now you know how everybody's always talking about, oh, the sanctity of marriage?

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:05.060
No, we were talking about the sanctity of marriage and we were bringing up examples

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:06.060
of why there's no sanctity.

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:09.000
You know, and those laws, and I don't mean to make it political, but whatever.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.640
The laws in those states pass, you know, marriage should always be a man and woman to protect

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.020
the sanctity of marriage, you know?

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.140
then we talk about Britney Spears gets married in an old within 48 hours.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.020
Excellent example of the sanctity of marriage at work, right?

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:25.180
So we're talking about who would you go to Vegas and get married and

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:26.100
then divorce right away.

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:29.980
Like we were talking, let's go to, since we can't, since like us being gay,

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:33.020
we can't marry each other, well, Jamie's already married, she can't remarry.

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:35.060
But the rest of us are all gay, we can't marry each other.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:35.660
I can pretend.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.700
So we're gonna marry women and go to Vegas and

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.180
just get married to a woman and then divorce.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.860
So they were saying, who should I marry?

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:44.780
And then your name came up, Irene, as to somebody I should marry.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:49.540
And I was like, no, I don't even want to be married to her for an hour.

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:52.540
Why do you look so sad?

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.420
You could marry Eddie or something.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:55.900
I would marry Eddie.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.980
What? We're gonna get married when we're 30.

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:00.100
Why did you look so shocked that I wouldn't marry you?

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:01.180
Because you don't want to marry me.

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.580
But it would be a dysfunctional marriage.

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:04.940
I mean, it would be really bad.

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.020
It would be really bad.

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.500
Everybody wants to marry me, you're up, you're just-

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:12.260
I had the bright idea of having a group wedding and then a group annulment.

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.620
That's a great idea, we should do that right now.

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:16.460
Forget the show.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:19.260
Rob, Irene's already married to somebody that you know, so.

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:19.820
Well, really?

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.060
Yeah.

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.300
Did she marry my boyfriend when I wasn't-

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.500
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.500
Good job. And he does crazy things to her all the time.

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.100
Are you putting out?

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:29.620
According to him, she is.

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:30.140
Well.

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.700
Can you see the pictures on my MySpace?

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.220
Well.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.020
Oh my gosh.

01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:33.580
Yeah, Irene.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:34.780
I mean, there's no pictures.

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:35.460
What?

01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.660
Huh?

01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:37.580
I don't really know what,

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:40.060
maybe it's because I've been drinking a little bit here in studio tonight.

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:41.580
But yeah, that had nothing to do with games.

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.300
Yeah, Irene-

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.220
Why don't you be sitting over there doing like the,

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.500
either the I've got to go to the bathroom dance or god damn it,

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.740
can we talk about video games?

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.460
Irene makes chocolate something that was on his shirt.

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:57.460
I like grapes.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.340
Eddie brings the show to a screeching halt.

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.100
Ten gamers score.

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:03.020
Anyways.

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.060
I also like beer.

01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:06.860
Beer is great.

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:08.540
Beer makes this show possible.

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.100
I'm sure I'm going to get some emails on that one.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:16.020
We got an email, we got emails in the past about me bashing on Sony and

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:19.500
you know, and stuff like that and saying that we should do it less.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.900
But honestly, they make it so easy.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.460
I mean, really.

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:31.500
Okay, for example, this mystical new 40 gigabyte PlayStation 3

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:35.980
skew, which we had no idea was going to come out, is now made official.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.380
And you know, earlier this week there was rumors saying, oh,

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:43.340
it's not going to be backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 games at all.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.900
And then people were like, oh no, of course it will be because, you know,

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:49.540
they do it all via software emulation and that kind of stuff.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.620
Well, come to find out, guess what?

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:55.260
It isn't backwards compatible with any PlayStation 2 games.

01:05:55.260 --> 01:06:01.180
So they removed essentially a free part of the PlayStation 3.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.820
Just to fuck you all over again.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:05.900
So it is official for Europe.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:08.180
It's going to be coming out here pretty soon.

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:11.700
It is not backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 titles at all.

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:17.420
It will be coming out on October 10th for a price of 399 euros.

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:22.260
And it will only have two USB ports instead of four, which is not a huge deal.

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:26.540
And none of the multi-memory card ports, which is also not a real big deal.

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:31.540
But come on, no backwards compatibility PlayStation 2 games?

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:36.860
I mean, yeah, I'm sure that they'll be busy playing your entire library of

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.620
games for the PlayStation 3.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:41.860
Why do you need PlayStation 2 games when you have Motorstorm and Lair?

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.740
Oh, well, my mistake.

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:46.180
Oh, you know, forgive me.

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:49.700
So it's not even backwards compatible with patches on the hard drive?

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:50.580
No, not at all.

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:55.100
In fact, it is only, I guess it is backwards compatible PlayStation 1 games

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:57.940
because they are part of the download network and I guess they have downloads

01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:59.060
for that stuff.

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:01.940
But I don't understand what they were thinking.

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.420
I mean, really, that is like crazy.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:07.740
The fact that it'll still do the PlayStation 1 games, I mean, and to play

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:12.260
Devil's Advocate, one comment I've heard on this is, well, why is it such a big

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:14.220
deal when you have a PlayStation 2 right there on the shelf?

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.180
Do you really need it to play PlayStation 2 games?

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.740
I say yes, because A, I know people who don't know PlayStation 2s.

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:20.460
Imports.

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:25.140
And B, PlayStation 2s sometimes break a while later.

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:27.620
Well, but you can't play PlayStation 2 imports.

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:28.260
They're not region free.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.620
I've seen them.

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.100
On a Japanese PlayStation 3, you can.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:31.820
Nope.

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:32.740
No, you can't.

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.180
There's video proof out there, I'll tell you.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:39.780
You cannot play Japanese games on PlayStation 2s or PlayStation 3s of other

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:40.220
regions.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.300
Only PlayStation 3 games are region free.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:45.500
Then the game might not have been coded.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:50.340
You know, it's just, it's really, really stupid.

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:55.420
I don't know what the hell they were thinking, but hey, if you want to, you

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:58.460
know, buy one of these, they will be available.

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.820
I mean, save yourself some money, I guess.

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:03.540
Maybe it's because they don't really want to cut the price on these.

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:08.020
And this is their way of, I don't know, getting people to buy the, I don't

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:08.260
know.

01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:11.700
I really, they're like, well, we're offering these cheaper skews, but it's

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:14.180
even starting with the 20 gig PS3.

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:17.460
It's like, well, we have this cheaper skew, but it's kind of, you know, a

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:18.660
little bit gimped.

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:22.740
So maybe just spend the extra $100 or whatever and buy the better one.

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.300
You know, and it's kind of what they've been doing.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.860
It's like we're throwing out this crap car.

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:30.540
It's like you can either choose this car with no wheels, no steering wheel, no

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:36.180
airbags, and no gas tank, or you could buy this Ferrari.

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.660
Which would you like?

01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:41.540
I love this comment in the chatroom from Escapist at chat.orangelandradio.com

01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:44.100
says, reactions to criticism.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.940
Nintendo gets angry.

01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:48.740
Microsoft is sorry and tries to fix the problem.

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:52.980
Sony goes and pleasures itself in the corner while singing show tunes.

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:56.780
OK, honestly, I mean, this, I don't know if this is officially coming over

01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:58.540
to the US yet, and so far it's not.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:01.380
My fair lady, is that me?

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:06.980
So far it's not, but I mean, really, clang, clang, clang goes the trolley.

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:07.980
Let me put it this way.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:12.620
If you're really serious on getting the PlayStation 3, and you're waiting for

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:18.300
Metal Gear Solid 4, Grand Theft Auto 4, Final Fantasy 13, I suggest you purchase

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:21.660
the console closer to the time when these games come out.

01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:25.700
Because by then they're going to have about four other skews that will have

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:32.060
varying degrees of crippled technology versus discount and stuff, and you can

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:33.060
make a better decision.

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:36.860
I mean, because honestly right now, spending the money to buy a crippled

01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:39.500
system is kind of stupid.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:42.500
And no people have been drawn to comparison, well, the core system doesn't

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:46.260
allow you to play backwards compatible games right out of the box, yeah, but

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:49.160
you can buy a hard drive for that later on, and then you can play backwards

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.160
compatible games.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.160
This, you're fucked.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.060
So, I don't get it.

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:56.540
I don't get why you would remove something that's free.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.860
It boggles my mind.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.580
I don't understand.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:06.220
I'm just a girl who can't say no, I'm in a terrible fix.

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:17.540
I'm singing in the rain.

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.380
This is great radio, you have.

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:23.220
See, that is the camera, oh, the camera's not on.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.780
No, the cam shut off after 40 minutes.

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:26.780
Anyway.

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:28.860
But you know, I hear that there's going to be a new skew or something coming

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:32.380
out over here with Spider-Man 3 bundled with it, so hey, at least you have a

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.900
fucking Blu-ray player.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.660
There you go.

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:40.100
Well, obviously, needless to say, this news makes us a little bit agitated,

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.660
especially for those of us that were hoping to clear the space on the shelves,

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:46.420
or maybe see some upscaled PlayStation 2, you know, that would have been kind

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:47.820
of cool too, and have some places to go.

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:48.820
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:52.180
Let me interrupt you real quick, because I forgot to add Sony's official

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:56.340
comment to explain why they decided not to put backwards compatibility in

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:57.340
there.

01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:02.620
It says, let's see here, there is sufficient choice in the marketplace,

01:11:02.620 --> 01:11:07.820
and that we're still better off using that money that we put into backwards

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:12.100
compatibility, either investing in new games or using that money to help

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.740
support bringing the price down.

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:18.260
We have made it clear on many occasions that our priority is on

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:22.300
developing innovative new features and services for the PlayStation 3, not

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.660
on backwards compatibility.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:31.300
Okay, but they have it built into the firmware right now.

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.980
Why remove it?

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:34.460
Because that's just being a dick.

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.460
That's what it is.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:44.460
When you're a gent, you know you're a gent.

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:59.420
Oh, by the way, I would like to remind you guys that Phil Harrison back

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:03.380
about a year ago said, backwards compatibility, as you know from

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:08.860
PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2, is a core value of what we believe we

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:14.340
should offer, and access to a library of content people have created, bought

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:18.940
for themselves and accumulated over the years, is necessary to create a

01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:19.940
format.

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:23.780
PlayStation is a format meaning that it transcends many devices,

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:28.980
PS1, PS2, and now PS3.

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:32.780
Well they also said that all the game developers copied their controller

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.540
design forgetting that they copied theirs from Super Nintendo, so you

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:36.540
know.

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.540
Whatever.

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:38.540
Let's continue.

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:47.060
Well, actually, Sony actually released an official statement on the

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:50.060
matter.

01:12:50.060 --> 01:13:03.380
What is that from?

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:08.060
You can't stop PS3, you can't stop it, you can't, can't stop the PS3.

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:16.060
They probably think they're winning right now.

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.060
We are winning.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:21.060
You can't buy a PS3 anywhere.

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:26.060
Sorry, I mean, but seriously, every week is a fucking story like this.

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:29.460
I mean, who the fuck is running their company?

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:32.300
I mean, how do they, how do they make these decisions?

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.300
Hey, let's have-

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.300
Champanzies.

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:35.740
I mean, who thinks up this shit?

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:36.740
I swear to God.

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.380
I read the joke earlier this week.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.580
There's some guy on their advertising or marketing strategies

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:44.180
team or whatever that's trying to get fired and come up with the

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:48.060
stupidest fucking ideas and wanting to get himself fired, and they're

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.900
like, hey, that's a great idea, let's run with that, and it's like, my

01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:51.900
God.

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.100
I mean, who thinks this is a crazy idea?

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:56.100
You know what?

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.420
I think what they do is that they have those magnets, you know, that

01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:04.340
you make your own poetry out of on their phone, and so they just, they

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:07.700
reach in and grab like six of them and put them in order, and that's

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:12.220
their new marketing plan, and that'll, and it's not people that are

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:13.220
picking them out.

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:14.220
They're trained monkeys.

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:19.060
No, they're, they're poorly trained monkeys, and sometimes they have to wipe the poo off

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:32.740
of them that they fling as they pick it.

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:50.340
So how many beers did you have, Rob?

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:55.300
Just one, amazingly.

01:14:55.300 --> 01:15:01.420
Now's a good time for the F-use of the week, as our chat room is just,

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.620
all I'm seeing in chat room is like, dot, dot, dot, just right on down

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:06.340
the screen.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.780
Let's get into the F-use of the week.

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:10.260
Ladies and gentlemen, we have some brand new old F-U music.

01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:13.900
We're bringing back an old F-U tonight, and let's kick it off.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.900
This is a part of the show where we get angsty, and obviously this news

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:18.860
about the removed backwards compatibility, which seems to be a step

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:21.620
backwards, makes us a little angry, and if you disagree, send us an email,

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:40.860
mailbag at orangeontraded.com, but for now, the F-U's of the week.

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:48.300
So my F-U of the week goes towards bitches, stupid petty bitches.

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.740
But Jamie, then you're screwing yourself.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:55.180
Now, okay, this is what happened at work.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:58.060
Now people know that I like to leave detailed diagrams on how people

01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.860
should park in a parking lot.

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:01.420
I didn't do that this time.

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:04.540
I was pulling into one of the last parking spots at work, and there was this

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:08.180
car that was double parked, and I nearly ran into their driver's side rear

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:09.540
of the mirror.

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:13.300
So I back out, park properly in the spot, and leave them a note that says,

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:14.780
please do not double park.

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:16.060
I even said please.

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:19.660
It was either that or call security and get them a ticket, and if they get

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:22.940
ticketed enough, then they have to park outside the parking lot.

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:25.580
But we have a gate at the parking lot.

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:29.540
So I go back in, and I go out, and these girls are standing around my car,

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:33.340
kneeling down by my tires, and I can hear these loud echoing voices, and

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:35.700
hear tire, and note, and this.

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:36.700
And then my mother calls me.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:37.700
I'm like, crap, mom.

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:40.980
So I'm talking to my mom, standing by the back door, watching them do shit to

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:43.940
my car, and I have no idea what they're doing, and then they get in their car

01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:46.580
and drive past, and then I hear, oh, there she is!

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:47.580
Like that.

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:51.340
So I'm on the phone with my mother, and you don't want to get into a fight

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:54.740
with loud people when you're on the phone with your mother, although my mom

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:56.620
would probably be very proud of me.

01:16:56.620 --> 01:16:57.620
Not really.

01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:58.620
So I go back-

01:16:58.620 --> 01:16:59.620
Question from chat real quick.

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:03.820
SSJ100Matt asks, where was YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com in this moment?

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:06.260
I didn't have any of the stickers on me.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.500
So I go back inside, wait five minutes, go back out after I'm off the phone

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.300
with my mom, and they're gone.

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:14.100
So I go back to my car, and I go about my business.

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.100
Everything seems fine.

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:18.140
You know, I have a magnet on my car, this little rainbow heart, and I thought

01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:21.100
that they stole it, but it turned out that my husband took it off when he was

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:23.140
driving my car when he was fixing it.

01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:27.660
So I get back, and my tires had been low for a couple weeks, so I said, you know,

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:30.660
I'm getting gas today, I'll go ahead and fill my tires.

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:34.940
And I tried to get the caps off on the passenger side, and the caps wouldn't

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:39.140
come off on the valve stems on my tires, but the other side was just fine.

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:42.780
So I end up going to Bridgestone the next day, and they had used two wrenches

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:47.880
to get the caps off, and it turned out that they put nail glue, like super glue,

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.940
in the caps on my tires.

01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:54.300
So now, see, I think it would have been much better for them to be a little

01:17:54.300 --> 01:18:00.740
peeved about a little note than be fired for vandalism and harassment, because

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:02.260
that's what's going to happen to them.

01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:05.420
I have the exact time of day that they drove out of the parking lot, and we

01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:10.500
have cameras that record all driver's, all license plates as they go in and

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.500
out.

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.540
When you are by the place, when you get your new badge, you are required

01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.980
to give your license plate number to security.

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:19.740
They're going to be very fired, all four of them, and I am going to laugh my

01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:20.740
ass off.

01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:21.740
The end.

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:26.380
Wow, I didn't know we had applause.

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:29.180
There's an applause light in here, apparently.

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.180
All right, moving on.

01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.660
No, no, no, because see, this is what I mean.

01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:34.660
You don't fuck with me.

01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:35.660
Low key.

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:36.660
Follow that.

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:37.660
F.E.

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:41.900
Donald's for not knowing how to fucking cook french fries, and you just put

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:43.940
them in the fucking fryer and push buttons.

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.940
How hard is that?

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:49.300
But yet, you fucking find a way to screw it up every single time.

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:54.300
I mean, seriously, fries should taste the same every single time.

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:58.620
Every time, because it's a button that you push.

01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.580
How the fuck do you fuck up a button?

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:03.740
I mean, really?

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:04.740
Fuck that.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.740
My F.E.

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:06.740
Of The Week.

01:19:06.740 --> 01:19:07.740
Come on.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.740
Showing us signs of support tonight.

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.740
All right.

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:11.740
I'm going to keep my F.E.

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:13.740
Brief tonight, because the others were a little long.

01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:14.740
Not that that's a problem.

01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.740
My F.E.'s brief tonight.

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:18.100
I'm going to give an F.E. to show tunes.

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.100
Enough said.

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:24.460
Puppy, you're up next.

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:30.260
I give an F.E. to the California DMV for being slow as fuck, even online.

01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:34.300
I paid my registration for my car two and a half weeks ago.

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:37.740
They still have not sent me my new tax.

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:38.740
And it's pissing me off.

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.900
And I'm waiting to get pulled over for it.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:42.900
And it's going to suck.

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:43.900
Hold your...

01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:44.900
Hold.

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:48.900
Okay, now you can applaud.

01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:50.500
Casper the Gay, your F.E.'s of The Week.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:54.500
Okay, I'm going to recant my F.E. to LucasArts, because they were really slow about getting

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:55.700
a Star Wars game to Wii.

01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:57.420
But they are going to have Force Unleashed on the Wii.

01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:00.140
And of course, it's going to be the best version, because it'll have all the lightsaber battles

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.440
and force control and stuff.

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:03.980
So yay, LucasArts.

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:06.020
That wasn't a true F.U., so you don't get applause.

01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:07.020
I had to recant it, so...

01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:08.020
In fact, you get booed.

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.020
Okay, they suck.

01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.020
They're shitheads.

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:13.620
How can you recant something that you never said in the first place?

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:14.620
Yeah, I did.

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:15.620
A couple weeks ago.

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:16.620
Three or four...

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.620
Yeah.

01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:18.620
Rice Princess, your turn.

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:22.020
F.U. to recanting stuff that you never said in the first place.

01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.020
Yay!

01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:28.140
I'm sort of trying to clap.

01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:38.540
Back to the show, from Angst and F.U.s to Harvest Moon.

01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:42.260
Harvest Moon, if you are a fan of farming, and actually I know there's some fans of Harvest

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:46.020
Moon, because I dared to make fun of Harvest Moon.

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:49.420
What else do you do on Harvest Moon?

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:52.300
You try to pick up a chick.

01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:54.860
I know we have some fans of Harvest Moon, because I got yelled at by one one week in

01:20:54.860 --> 01:20:55.860
an email.

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:56.860
You're a fan of Harvest Moon.

01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:58.980
Okay, well then good, this ought to be good news.

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:02.660
The Harvest Moon creator, Yasuo Iwata, has announced that the next Harvest Moon game

01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:05.460
is going to be online.

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:09.500
Meaning that between two and eight players can actually visit a town.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:12.860
The only trick, we don't know what platform the game's on yet.

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:16.180
But the next Harvest Moon game will be online.

01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:17.180
So there it is.

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:18.780
And it won't be Nintendo.

01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:19.780
Well, not necessarily.

01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:20.780
It could be DS.

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.420
That could be a very DS thing.

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:25.980
What are you going to do, have competitive cow milking?

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:28.260
Stop releasing so many damn Harvest Moon games.

01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:31.380
There's been like four this year already, and there's still more coming.

01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:32.380
Well, no, I'm serious.

01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:35.020
What are you going to do, have competing farms or some shit?

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:36.820
Or go visit other people's cows?

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:40.460
What the hell did you do in Animal Crossing?

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:43.380
You ran to towns and hit people with bug nets, and it was funny.

01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.760
Or buried things in holes.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.900
And you sent dirty letters to their townsfolk.

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:49.500
That's right, and you buried pitfalls in front of people's houses.

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:52.500
No, I'll tell you what you do in Animal Crossing.

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:57.220
You play the game with your best friend, only to have him backstab you and get the trophy

01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:59.380
first.

01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.420
Did you forget, Rob, so easily?

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:03.940
Yeah, actually, I did forget.

01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:05.700
Somebody's got some issues.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.260
Hey, you know what?

01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:09.260
It hurt.

01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:13.500
Well, you're seriously mad that I went and got the gold villager?

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:14.500
I was mad for like two minutes.

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:16.260
I was like, stupid motherfucker.

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:17.660
It's been a little longer than two minutes.

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:18.980
It's been like two and a half years.

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:19.980
Well, you know what?

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.980
I thought about it again, okay?

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:22.980
Jeez.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:23.980
Work with me on this.

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:24.980
Gosh.

01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:25.980
Oops.

01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:26.980
You know what?

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:32.620
I want factory moon, where instead of having a cow on a farm, you have a cow factory.

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:35.260
You have like a deer, like a, you know, cow shwits.

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:38.780
Yeah, I was going to say, all they need to do is put a slaughterhouse in Harvest Moon,

01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.900
and the game will be like ten times cooler.

01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:43.020
Well, they do have-

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:44.940
PETA will protest.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:51.620
They do have Innocent Life, a futuristic Harvest Moon, which takes farming to the future.

01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:52.620
Guess what?

01:22:52.620 --> 01:23:00.180
It's just the same as farming now, except it's in the future.

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:02.780
Hurrah.

01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:04.100
Let's go on to the next story.

01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:07.060
I don't think there's anything more we can say on Harvest Moon.

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:09.460
Except that it's Harvest Moon.

01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:15.340
So this should, this is actually pretty, and I love stuff like this, where they do studies

01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:20.820
about how video games improve your intelligence and your skills and shit.

01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:24.620
They're saying now that action games improve women's spatial abilities.

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:26.100
Okay.

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:30.820
Because they didn't have any to begin with.

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:33.260
I'm asking a hypothetical question.

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:40.260
It says that it helps improve skills like geometry, technical drawings, reading maps.

01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:43.180
Anything that has to do with space and how-

01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:46.060
Not that a woman would ever admit to doing that.

01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:51.340
Why do you need geometry for shopping anyway?

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:52.340
Geometry?

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:54.340
What is that?

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:55.340
Geometry?

01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:56.340
What?

01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.340
I'm just kidding.

01:23:57.340 --> 01:23:59.340
Here, take this back.

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:06.540
But it's more or less the cognitive function of how things fit, how things are laid out.

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:11.500
Space, you know, judging distances, that type of thing.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:19.580
But I look at it this way, that anything that you do that makes you use that skill should

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:20.740
improve it.

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:26.620
So really, a video game could help with that, but so could actually, you know, practicing

01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:33.100
topography or, you know, spending time drawing or-

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:34.100
Raising cows.

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.800
No, not raising cows.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:41.660
So which one of those abilities focuses on using the turn signal when switching lanes?

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:42.660
You know what?

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:44.460
I have actually run across more male drivers-

01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:47.220
I was trying very hard to refrain from the driving joke.

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:48.460
You should be very proud of me.

01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:52.060
I was trying very hard not to say, but will it make them better drivers?

01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:54.140
I was doing very, very good.

01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:55.140
You know what?

01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:56.940
Gender has absolutely nothing to do with bad driving.

01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:00.400
It's overall intelligence, and I've run it across more male drivers who are worse drivers

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.400
than women.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:03.940
Okay, well then this makes the point, why just women?

01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.060
Why doesn't it give men better spatial abilities?

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:10.060
Because I think that they've just did the study on women.

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:12.060
Because we're super awesome.

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:13.060
No.

01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:17.300
Because I know that the majority of people in this room are male, but I'm sorry, testosterone

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:18.300
makes you stupid.

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:19.300
Oh, snap.

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:20.300
No, no, no, no.

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.300
This is Rob's party.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:22.300
What are you talking about, testosterone?

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:33.900
I don't mean it like that, but I think that having a higher tendency toward aggression

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.940
usually leads to less common sense.

01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:36.940
I see.

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:40.660
Now, JV Monn in the chat room gives a comment that makes it all make sense.

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:44.300
JV Monn says, men get better spatial ability from masturbating.

01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:47.820
So you know how much clearance you need?

01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:50.220
There you go.

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:56.140
I don't really think that men have, I don't really think, after living in a house and

01:25:56.140 --> 01:26:01.580
having my husband and all of his friends over, I don't think that, from that sample, I don't

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:08.140
think that all men have good spatial ability or else they wouldn't pee on the seat.

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:12.100
And we learn how to close the seat when they're done.

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.340
Hey, you know what?

01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:18.580
Some things are skill, some things are luck, okay?

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:19.580
You know what?

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.780
You learn how to pee when you're little, so you should have a lot of practice.

01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:23.620
God, is this segment done yet?

01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:24.620
Never.

01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:25.620
Oh, lordy.

01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:29.580
This is probably going to be like our longest segment in a long time.

01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.060
We're already over an hour and a half.

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:32.060
Anyway.

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:33.060
Anyways.

01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:34.060
Yes, please.

01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:46.580
Speaking of pee, SingStar R&B has been announced, because god damn there hasn't been enough SingStar

01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:54.380
games this year yet, but apparently a wonderful track list is coming out as well, including

01:26:54.380 --> 01:27:02.940
all sorts of fun stuff, Black Eyed Peas, Pump It, Destiny's Child, Bootylicious, DJ Jazzy

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:11.700
Jeff and the French Prince, Summertime, that's pretty awesome, Gwen Stefani, Hollaback Girl,

01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:20.860
and let's see here, Luther Vandross, Never Too Much, OutKast, Idlewild, Blue, Don't You

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:29.260
Worry About Me, and Whitney Houston, Your Love Is My Love, among others.

01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:33.700
And I knew it would take merely seconds for someone to make this comment, but a Hippolytus

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:36.060
in our chat room says, Black Eyed Peas is not R&B.

01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:40.380
That would take five seconds for someone to say that.

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:43.220
Don't tell my mother about this game, because she loves Luther Vandross.

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:44.220
She really does.

01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:47.240
And if you know my mother, she's...

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:48.300
I think she likes both.

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:53.900
I don't think Hollaback Girl is R&B either, but you know, whatever.

01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:54.900
That's true too.

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:55.900
I don't know.

01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:56.900
A little bit.

01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:57.900
All right.

01:27:57.900 --> 01:28:03.580
Anyway, let's go on to a brand new segment, which is going to be our last segment of part

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.940
A tonight.

01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:08.580
We're going to actually make this kind of a regular thing, is that this will always

01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:13.340
kind of be our bookend to part A, moving into part B, is a brand new segment here on Orange

01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:14.340
Laundry Radio.

01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:15.700
We've been promising it for weeks.

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:16.700
It's here.

01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:20.340
It's Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:25.380
But I have the same old music.

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:28.660
I know, because the chat room really liked the old music.

01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:31.020
It didn't want to see it go away, so we had to keep it.

01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:33.860
So Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:41.460
The Classic Game of the Week is Fantasy Zone, which is my second favorite video game ever.

01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:46.020
Fantasy Zone is a game where you play as a little ship called the Oppa Oppa.

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:48.460
It's this little red ship with a window on it.

01:28:48.460 --> 01:28:52.740
It has wings, but when it's on the ground, it walks.

01:28:52.740 --> 01:29:01.580
And listen, the music has got the best music ever.

01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:04.300
It plays a lot like Defender.

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:05.300
It is.

01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:06.300
It's Chibi Defender, basically.

01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:07.300
Anyway, you can keep reading.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:08.300
I'm going to let this play in the background.

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:18.700
I just want to play a little bit of music in the chat room.

01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:19.700
Good times.

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:20.700
I like how the ship has feet.

01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:24.260
Yeah, when you're on the ground, the ship has feet, and it walks.

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:27.740
It's cute.

01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:30.660
The Oppa Oppa actually was first in the Zillion anime.

01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:33.180
I don't know if anyone's ever played Zillion.

01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:37.300
Zillion was the game that they based the Zapper off of for the Master System.

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:41.440
But there were also other versions that came out.

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.440
There was...

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.180
And I actually have the other versions.

01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:49.860
I have Fantasy Zone on Master System and Super Nintendo, Fantasy Zone 2 on both.

01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:50.860
I have...

01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:53.180
Now, Space Fantasy Zone was one that came out on...

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:58.580
Well, it was a prototype only that was supposed to be out on the TurboGrafx Duo.

01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:01.980
And I have a burn of it, but I haven't actually sat down and played it yet.

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:07.220
And then there was a Super Fantasy Zone.

01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:13.240
Also for anyone who's a fan of in-portrait and cast games, some of the enemies from Fantasy

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:21.620
Zone 2 were in the final boss for the game Sega Gaga, for anyone who can play that.

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:23.020
But it's a fun little game.

01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:29.580
And also the Fantasy Zone is the same universe that Space Harrier was set in.

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:37.260
And you actually have a later level in Fantasy Zone that's the Space Harrier level.

01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:43.220
Yes, currently our little ship, the Opa-Opa, is fighting a big tree that's spinning leaves.

01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:44.220
A tree trunk.

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:45.220
But it's cute!

01:30:45.220 --> 01:30:46.220
It's cute!

01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:47.220
It's okay.

01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:51.380
Well, in the Space Harrier level, you actually fight low-eye heads.

01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:54.020
But also another thing.

01:30:54.020 --> 01:31:01.620
For anyone who was collecting the Sega Ages 2900 collection, they redid the whole thing

01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:05.220
in 3D, but it was still side-scrolling.

01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:11.380
But when you did your bonus level where you have to go catch all these coins, it was in

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:12.380
first person.

01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:15.220
So, Rob, you played Mike Robbie.

01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:16.220
Yes.

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.220
It was kind of neat.

01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:23.020
But it was probably one of the best Sega games ever.

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:24.020
I think.

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:25.020
Alright.

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:30.400
And you could also go in shops and buy, like, anvils.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.400
And wings!

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.400
And fairy wings for your ship.

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:36.020
And you could buy wings and you could buy extra boosters and different types of rockets.

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:39.620
But I just like you buy this big thing that's like the one ton thing that they drop in the

01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:42.100
Looney Tunes cartoons and just drop it on ships.

01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:43.100
It was great.

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:44.100
Good times.

01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:50.220
Alright, well, Fantasy Zone is the classic game of the week, so check it out at your

01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:55.260
local swap meet or, you know, there's other ways you can go about finding a ROM of Fantasy

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.260
Zone.

01:31:56.260 --> 01:31:57.260
But we can't talk about that on the show.

01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:58.260
Two dollars on eBay.

01:31:58.260 --> 01:31:59.260
Alright.

01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:02.980
Well, that's going to bring to a close part A of our podcast, but fear not, there's plenty

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:07.360
more Orange Launch Radio to come, like it or not, in part B. And coming up tonight in

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:12.780
part B, since it is episode 250, we have to do one of our very favorite segments, Match

01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:13.780
Game, coming up tonight.

01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:14.780
That's right.

01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:15.780
Applause.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.660
The light is, our new applause light is flashing apparently.

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:18.660
Alright.

01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:20.540
So the match game will be up in just a little bit.

01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:23.540
We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this, which, by the way,

01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:25.740
oh, I need to say one more thing about the show.

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:29.620
The show is now going to be released on, due to popular demand, instead of making it wait

01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:32.620
until Wednesday, you now get part B on Tuesday on the feed.

01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:35.620
I thought you were saying we're going to release it on Betamax.

01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:36.620
Maybe we could, actually.

01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:37.620
Dude, that would be cool.

01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:39.380
We could actually find a working beta machine.

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.780
We have to go to the TV station to find that.

01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:44.740
It'll be released on Laserdisc and beta.

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:45.740
Alright.

01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:50.820
And hopefully we will try very hard to keep part B show tunes free.

01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:51.820
Alright.

01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:52.820
We'll see.

01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:53.820
Maybe.

01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:57.660
Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:32:57.660 --> 01:33:02.060
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:03.060
a week.

01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:16.020
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
