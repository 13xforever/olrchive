00:15.480 --> 00:19.720
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.600
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Part B of our podcast.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.760
Of course, Orange Lounge Radio is released twice every week, once on Sundays right after

00:27.760 --> 00:30.440
our live program has finished taping, and once on Tuesdays.

00:30.440 --> 00:35.200
That is a slightly different schedule, starting last week is when we started that new schedule.

00:35.200 --> 00:40.160
Joining us tonight in Orange Lounge Radio Part B, Craig Howard, game manager, and Ben

00:40.160 --> 00:42.160
Ward, community manager for Bizarre Creations.

00:42.160 --> 00:46.800
We're going to be talking Geometry Wars Galaxies in just a little bit, but first we're going

00:46.800 --> 00:48.360
to get back to the news.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.920
So Loki, why don't you start us off in this Part B.

00:50.920 --> 00:58.200
Anyway, so of course the 40GB PS3 has now been rumored to be coming out in the U.S.

00:58.200 --> 01:02.800
on November 2nd, that would be the same, I think it's around the same time as the Euro

01:02.800 --> 01:03.800
version.

01:03.800 --> 01:08.800
Anyway, same issues with the European model, it's not going to have backwards compatibility

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
to PlayStation 2.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.920
And I stand corrected from what I said last week, I was a little confused with the chips

01:13.920 --> 01:15.440
and what they did and shit.

01:15.440 --> 01:20.520
So originally they had taken out the Emotion engine, which dropped the backwards compatibility

01:20.520 --> 01:24.460
a little bit, now they removed the second chip that did the rest of the backwards compatibility

01:24.460 --> 01:25.460
for PlayStation 2.

01:25.460 --> 01:29.560
So it's not a software thing, it is something that they're doing to save money, still stupid

01:29.560 --> 01:30.560
though.

01:30.560 --> 01:36.440
They took out one of the biggest marketing things they had, I mean they were totally

01:36.440 --> 01:37.680
doing it around that Emotion.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.920
You don't have to buy that version, you can spend $100 more and buy one that does play

01:41.920 --> 01:44.120
some...

01:44.120 --> 01:48.720
Basically they removed it's soul, or my soul, depending on how you want to look at it.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.920
But hey, that's okay because you'll buy a 48 PS3 if you're in Japan because they're

01:52.920 --> 01:53.920
white.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.240
And that makes all the difference.

01:57.240 --> 02:01.040
They're available in white, as well as black.

02:01.040 --> 02:04.400
Any chance we might get the other colors over here?

02:04.400 --> 02:07.120
Or do they say, are they going to be all Nintendo?

02:07.120 --> 02:10.720
We don't need to do different colors right now, even though we always do different colors,

02:10.720 --> 02:13.120
because the current consoles are still selling like crazy.

02:13.120 --> 02:16.360
We don't want to confuse people anymore, you know.

02:16.360 --> 02:20.360
I don't know, eventually I'm sure there will be different console colors, much like there

02:20.360 --> 02:21.360
is with the PS2.

02:21.360 --> 02:26.600
But PS2, they stuck with black for a long time, until silver, I think that was just

02:26.600 --> 02:27.600
this summer.

02:27.600 --> 02:33.120
So, I mean, shit, they're a little late to the game with the colors for the PS2 as well.

02:33.120 --> 02:39.760
Going to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, GS68 says, white PS3s, I call racism.

02:39.760 --> 02:44.640
Did anybody else do that ad?

02:44.640 --> 02:45.640
What?

02:45.640 --> 02:50.320
You guys already probably covered it, it just reminded me of that ad for I think a PSP in

02:50.320 --> 02:51.320
Japan.

02:51.320 --> 02:56.000
That was a long time ago, it just reminded me of it, that white chick.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.040
Chris the lesbian, taking us back to the sounds of 2006, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.440
Love you, Chris.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.440
You're up.

03:03.440 --> 03:04.440
Bite me.

03:04.440 --> 03:11.240
Okay, so we know Sony has these white and black issues.

03:11.240 --> 03:16.120
Why not red, where's the red love, and the yellow love, and the blue love and the purple

03:16.120 --> 03:17.120
love, huh?

03:17.120 --> 03:18.120
Where is it?

03:18.120 --> 03:19.120
American love.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.400
Well, you aren't going to get any love.

03:22.400 --> 03:27.680
You see those extra colors, that costs money, and obviously they're trying to save money.

03:27.680 --> 03:32.560
Actually, I take it back, there is a red PlayStation 3, I think they made like three of them, because

03:32.560 --> 03:37.040
I seem to remember some Canadian contest where they were giving away like red PS3s in Canada.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.800
Or you can go on the internet and buy them in any color.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.460
Or you can go to Target and get a can of spray paint.

03:43.460 --> 03:47.460
Just be careful.

03:47.460 --> 03:52.440
But I have to have one that matches my carpet.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.080
I'm being hypothetical.

03:54.080 --> 04:00.320
Alright, anyhow, speaking of the Sony PSP, see at least Chris was able to take us on

04:00.320 --> 04:05.440
the right path, and take us over to the PSP, and we want to talk about some first party

04:05.440 --> 04:08.960
PSP titles that are coming in the year 2008.

04:08.960 --> 04:13.140
There's going to be seven first party download titles coming to the PSP.

04:13.140 --> 04:14.140
Now how does that work?

04:14.140 --> 04:16.440
Because I haven't downloaded anything on the PSP yet.

04:16.440 --> 04:20.480
I haven't either.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.520
Well I guess you take your PSP, connect to the Sony store, and you can download all of

04:24.520 --> 04:25.520
these.

04:25.520 --> 04:29.120
It's eventually going to be with the Sony store on PC or on the PS3, you just download

04:29.120 --> 04:36.040
it and you transfer it to the memory stick, and hopefully it's a lot better than the stupid

04:36.040 --> 04:39.880
demos, because the demos you have to put in this fucking specific directory and they have

04:39.880 --> 04:45.240
all these specific instructions instead of, throw it in the games folder and it will work.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.880
You know, something like that.

04:46.880 --> 04:51.540
Well there's going to be three action games, two music games, one shooter, and one racer.

04:51.540 --> 04:55.680
But if you were hoping I was going to name those seven titles, sorry, that story's in

04:55.680 --> 04:56.680
another castle.

04:56.680 --> 05:01.720
You know, sorry, this kind of brings me back to that WiiWare story that we did in part

05:01.720 --> 05:09.360
A, but I remember there was also a Hudson karaoke game that's coming to WiiWare.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.360
Hudson's cool.

05:10.360 --> 05:21.560
Well, as long as I can sing Fergalicious, to the E, to the R-G-I-L-E, no one can hear

05:21.560 --> 05:22.560
you.

05:22.560 --> 05:31.280
So a new demo was announced for the PS3 store, which is Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction.

05:31.280 --> 05:42.600
Also, I think out for a demo is NHL 2K8 and Conan, but Sony's recent update was also saying

05:42.600 --> 05:48.040
that they were also going to be putting up demos for Uncharted, Folklore, and Fallout

05:48.040 --> 05:50.040
3.

05:50.040 --> 06:13.120
Demos, demos, demos.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.600
When did EA become a contestant on Supermarket Sweep?

06:16.600 --> 06:19.600
I mean seriously, they're taking these gaming companies and just throwing them into the

06:19.600 --> 06:22.480
carts like the hams that they used to have on the show.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.480
Does anybody know what I'm talking about?

06:23.480 --> 06:24.480
Yes, I do.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.400
Please tell me someone in the chat knows what I'm talking about when I say they're being

06:26.400 --> 06:27.400
like Supermarket Sweep.

06:27.400 --> 06:33.440
So anyways, and then of course Pandemic, they're making the brand new Mercenaries 2 game, which

06:33.440 --> 06:35.520
looks pretty cool.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.480
So lots of good stuff.

06:37.480 --> 06:41.320
No word on what's going to happen with Mass Effect since it's being published by Microsoft

06:41.320 --> 06:46.600
this time, but who knows, Mass Effect 2 is definitely going to be published by EA.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.760
Why do they have that picture?

06:49.760 --> 06:53.220
So it's very interesting.

06:53.220 --> 06:55.360
Why do you think EA is trying to buy all these companies?

06:55.360 --> 06:56.360
What's their strategy?

06:56.360 --> 06:59.600
Is it just like a Monopoly type thing or they're just trying to grab the, I mean, because Bioware

06:59.600 --> 07:02.720
doing Mass Effect, I mean, they're just trying to foresee that, oh, this is going to be a

07:02.720 --> 07:03.720
huge title.

07:03.720 --> 07:11.120
Because Activision is bizarre, so, you know, they got a monkey see monkey do, I don't know.

07:11.120 --> 07:17.880
Activision and like EA are in this pissing contest to who can make the best games.

07:17.880 --> 07:21.120
Hint to Activision, stay away from Spider-Man games.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.920
Not doing very good for you.

07:23.920 --> 07:29.360
Sorry, I was looking up on YouTube some clips of Supermarket Sweep, but I guess we'll have

07:29.360 --> 07:32.440
to, I want you all in the studio to know I'm not crazy.

07:32.440 --> 07:36.840
This was a real bad ass TV show they used to have on the telly.

07:36.840 --> 07:37.840
Do you?

07:37.840 --> 07:42.240
My granny used to watch it and I'd be, I'd have to watch it when I went to Dothan.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.840
I used to make my grandma watch it.

07:45.840 --> 07:50.180
I used to watch it all the time with like one of the early morning game shows back when

07:50.180 --> 07:53.720
I was like 10 years old and all I watched was game shows.

07:53.720 --> 07:58.040
Now when I was 10 years old, the things that we watched were reruns of Press Your Luck.

07:58.040 --> 08:03.080
No, Amy, no, Amy, no, Amy, no, Amy, no, Amy, stop!

08:03.080 --> 08:06.780
What dude, when I used to go shopping with my mom and I would put these random, like

08:06.780 --> 08:10.640
Nintendo magazines and candy in the cart, my mom would be all, how did that get there?

08:10.640 --> 08:14.960
I'm like, I'm practicing to be on Supermarket Sweep.

08:14.960 --> 08:15.960
Innocent look.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.400
Why did I hear 50 hams in our cart?

08:19.400 --> 08:22.480
I don't know, I like ham.

08:22.480 --> 08:28.080
Christmas is coming, didn't you get the memo?

08:28.080 --> 08:33.240
PlayStation Network is getting some updates, or actually got some updates, not only the

08:33.240 --> 08:37.240
Ratchet and Clank demo, to which Jamie earlier mentioned, but also a title that a lot of

08:37.240 --> 08:40.320
folks have been looking forward to, Everyday Shooter.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.720
So it's kind of cool that the PlayStation is now getting some kind of like, you know,

08:43.720 --> 08:47.980
indie-ish games you can't get other places and Everyday Shooter is one of those games

08:47.980 --> 08:49.240
I've heard a lot of good things about.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.960
You can get a wrestler for that kind of stuff.

08:50.960 --> 08:51.960
What?

08:51.960 --> 08:52.960
If you're an everyday shooter.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.480
I'm not talking about like going out and shooting people from a clock tower or whatever.

08:57.480 --> 09:02.240
I'm talking about, Chris, your jaw just dropped and like hit the hardwood floor.

09:02.240 --> 09:07.040
While I was in Madison, I don't know the details and you guys may have covered it, but some

09:07.040 --> 09:11.120
guy was going through one of the University of Wisconsin buildings.

09:11.120 --> 09:16.360
I don't know if he had a weapon with him, or I forgot what exactly the details were,

09:16.360 --> 09:20.320
but he ended up jumping out of a window and the reason he was, you know, he was running

09:20.320 --> 09:23.880
around the building like he was shooting things, because he thought he was playing the video

09:23.880 --> 09:24.880
game Doom.

09:24.880 --> 09:25.880
Wow.

09:25.880 --> 09:32.360
And people wonder why video games are being purchased.

09:32.360 --> 09:36.560
That's the problem is he was playing Doom still, I mean, he needs to really update his

09:36.560 --> 09:37.560
game.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.880
If we could ban him from Doom, we would.

09:40.880 --> 09:50.560
You know what, Darwin Awards, that's a perfect candidate for the Darwin Awards.

09:50.560 --> 09:57.200
Well Everyday Shooter will set you back $9.99, or to the rest of us that's $10.

09:57.200 --> 10:01.320
Also on the PlayStation Network, you can get some Everyday Shooter wallpaper, and the cost

10:01.320 --> 10:02.320
of that?

10:02.320 --> 10:03.320
Free!

10:03.320 --> 10:08.480
Some movie trailers as well, Spiderwick Chronicles, Walk Hard, The Assassination of Jesse James,

10:08.480 --> 10:12.440
and some trailers for some video games, Fallout 3, Folklore, and I believe some things that

10:12.440 --> 10:16.480
were already mentioned previously in the show.

10:16.480 --> 10:21.040
So that means you gotta tune in, yo, listen to what we say.

10:21.040 --> 10:30.100
So for those who were all, you know, happy about SingStar coming out, prepare to be unhappy.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.100
Completely not happy.

10:31.100 --> 10:38.760
It has been delayed past November 3rd, and it is hanging out, I guess, with Duke Nukem

10:38.760 --> 10:53.800
forever in Limbo Land, going, uh, I exist in theory, but will I release, oh no, oh no.

10:53.800 --> 10:59.600
They're not giving a reason for the delay, although the theories are that it's licensing

10:59.600 --> 11:08.220
problems and PlayStation Network issues, um, but the Euro version will be out on time.

11:08.220 --> 11:11.640
This kind of makes me sad, because I was looking forward to that whole, like, YouTubey channel

11:11.640 --> 11:16.080
that they were going to be doing with SingStar, and, like, I was going to tape Loki in secret,

11:16.080 --> 11:19.280
singing, like, Britney Spears or something, and then, like, put that up for the internet

11:19.280 --> 11:21.700
to see, and they would have loved it.

11:21.700 --> 11:27.240
So damn it, when we made the tingle bet, we should have made the tingle bet around SingStar.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.820
Instead of Loki setting an eye of judgment on fire in a match with Bobby, what we should

11:30.820 --> 11:34.240
have done is we should have made him do something on SingStar and then upload it to the network.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.320
You know it would have been the number one video of all time.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.480
Hey, you know, we still have I'm Staying In.

11:39.480 --> 11:42.240
I know, but that's, that's, like, last year's joke.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.240
I lied.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.240
Actually, it's three years ago's joke.

11:44.240 --> 11:48.000
You know what, though, at E3, I really liked SingStar, because I had some random guy come

11:48.000 --> 11:53.320
up and we were singing, um, um, Motorhead at E3.

11:53.320 --> 11:56.720
Do you have any My Chemical Romance on it?

11:56.720 --> 11:57.720
I don't remember.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.240
Well, they have the expandable store, so you could get probably tons of stuff on it.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.440
I think everyone can get their emo on.

12:02.440 --> 12:05.560
Yes, I'm sure there's one of those bands you can get your emo on.

12:05.560 --> 12:09.200
I have a video of Meg Z singing that from her cell phone, so I think she would enjoy

12:09.200 --> 12:10.200
that.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.200
Meg Z is very much now obsessed with My Chemical Romance.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.200
Interesting.

12:13.200 --> 12:18.920
She has the emo kid haircut now.

12:18.920 --> 12:22.040
She might be the first lesbian I've ever met who's obsessed with My Chemical Romance.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.320
I don't usually, like, oh, second lesbian.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.320
Sorry, Chris.

12:26.320 --> 12:30.720
What about, like, I thought lesbians listened to, like, Melissa Etheridge and, uh, Katie

12:30.720 --> 12:35.560
Lang and, uh, yeah, that I Kissed a Girl song and, uh, Sarah McLachlan.

12:35.560 --> 12:36.560
Come on.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.560
What's up?

12:37.560 --> 12:38.560
What happened to Lilith Fair?

12:38.560 --> 12:46.160
Yeah, well, most people think that a lot of gay guys don't play video games, Rob, and

12:46.160 --> 12:49.240
the webcam can catch that look.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.840
Well, what can we say?

12:51.840 --> 12:53.600
We're special here at Orange Lawners Radio.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.600
Very special.

12:54.600 --> 12:58.120
We are special because, uh, we're getting back into the interview habit and getting

12:58.120 --> 13:02.520
some people on our program, uh, coming on here and talking about the latest.

13:02.520 --> 13:06.480
As you know, we here at Orange Lawners Radio have a strange fascination with the lolcats,

13:06.480 --> 13:09.800
so if you were listening a few weeks ago, you know that the advertisements for Geometry

13:09.800 --> 13:12.340
Wars Galaxies gave us a good laugh.

13:12.340 --> 13:15.580
We knew we had to get them on the show to talk to them a little bit more about the ads

13:15.580 --> 13:17.520
and more importantly, the game, and guess what?

13:17.520 --> 13:18.520
We got them.

13:18.520 --> 13:22.960
Craig Howard is a game manager for Bizarre Creations and worked on not only Geometry

13:22.960 --> 13:25.800
Wars Galaxies but Boom Boom Rocket.

13:25.800 --> 13:30.480
We were also joined during the interview by Ben Ward, Bizarre Creations' community manager.

13:30.480 --> 13:34.560
Sadly, they couldn't be here live due to the time delay because they're over in the UK,

13:34.560 --> 13:44.240
but let's listen in on what they had to say earlier this week.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.240
How are you doing out there, Craig?

13:45.240 --> 13:46.240
Yeah, I'm doing well, thanks.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.240
Awesome.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.240
It's a little bit cold at the moment.

13:48.240 --> 13:53.040
We'll see you here as well as Ben Ward as well as some Bizarre.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.040
Oh, great.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.080
Welcome, both of you guys, to the program.

13:57.080 --> 14:00.400
Of course, there's a little bit of a delay here since we are talking from such a cross

14:00.400 --> 14:04.960
a great distance because you guys are based out over there in the UK, right?

14:04.960 --> 14:07.360
Yeah, it rained in Liverpool.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.360
Oh, right.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.360
I'll do that at the moment.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.000
It's just great.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Awesome.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.200
So now, you've worked on games not only just like Geometry Wars but you've also worked

14:17.200 --> 14:19.200
on Boom Boom Rocket in the past?

14:19.200 --> 14:20.760
Yeah, that's right.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.760
Yeah.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.760
Awesome.

14:22.760 --> 14:27.000
And the first thing I've got to ask you, since when do cats advertise video games?

14:27.000 --> 14:31.600
I don't know, who came up with that idea?

14:31.600 --> 14:33.000
Was it Roger Sierra?

14:33.000 --> 14:38.920
It was just some crazy sort of idea that Sierra guys came up with and it sort of went with

14:38.920 --> 14:42.320
the crazy commercial that we were running just before that.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.840
Did you see the TV advert with all the guys dressed up as drum tour shapes?

14:45.840 --> 14:50.840
I did, and that's available on the internet, on the website, too, and that's one of my

14:50.840 --> 14:54.560
favorite songs you guys are using in the background for that advertisement.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.400
It's a cover of a They Might Be Giants song, and so that's hilarious.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.400
Yeah, you got it.

14:58.400 --> 15:03.200
So that was just something that the guys at Sierra came up with, and they literally just

15:03.200 --> 15:07.680
wanted to make it a little bit quirky and a little bit sort of unusual and pull the

15:07.680 --> 15:11.200
sort of audience in that you wouldn't normally get in a drum tour game?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.200
Yeah, I mean, we did.

15:13.200 --> 15:17.800
One of the good things is it's not just like a sci-fi style advertising campaign if you

15:17.800 --> 15:18.800
guys are drum tours.

15:18.800 --> 15:25.120
It's very interesting to try to get more people interested in looking at the game.

15:25.120 --> 15:30.120
Yeah, and it strangely seems to fit, you know, when you're hearing about Triangle Man, and

15:30.120 --> 15:33.840
there actually are little triangle things that you're fighting in the game and everything,

15:33.840 --> 15:34.840
right?

15:34.840 --> 15:35.840
Yeah, totally.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.400
Well, we couldn't really make it too serious because that's not really what drum tours

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
is about.

15:40.400 --> 15:44.920
It's about having fun with your friends and sort of really getting stuck into a fun arcade

15:44.920 --> 15:45.920
game.

15:45.920 --> 15:50.400
It's not about realistically fighting geometric shapes in outer space or something, you know?

15:50.400 --> 15:52.200
So it's all about having fun.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.200
Absolutely, I agree.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.040
It is all about having fun.

15:55.040 --> 16:01.440
Tell me about, you know, Geometry Wars started as a part of Project Gotham Racing, turns

16:01.440 --> 16:05.920
into this spin-off game that's hugely successful on Xbox Live Arcade.

16:05.920 --> 16:11.160
Where did the decision come to take the game, the series, from the Xbox Live or the Xbox

16:11.160 --> 16:13.040
platform over to the Nintendo platform?

16:13.040 --> 16:14.560
It's a standalone series.

16:14.560 --> 16:19.680
Well, I mean, one of the things with Geometry Wars is it's always kind of used to test code

16:19.680 --> 16:20.680
as well.

16:20.680 --> 16:25.600
And when we got the dev kits for Wii, we started to have an experiment.

16:25.600 --> 16:31.240
Obviously, a few people started playing it, and then our ideas were going, initially,

16:31.240 --> 16:37.480
there was no channel, there was no WiiWare or anything like that for the DS or Wii.

16:37.480 --> 16:43.080
So we thought if we were going to take it across into these platforms, what would we

16:43.080 --> 16:47.400
give, how would we get it to make it feel worthwhile on those platforms?

16:47.400 --> 16:49.960
It just seemed like a fun challenge, you know?

16:49.960 --> 16:51.280
The controls are interesting.

16:51.280 --> 16:56.320
Some people don't believe that it'll work well, but until you actually play the game,

16:56.320 --> 17:03.360
the nunchuck and the, you know, it just feels so, it feels so much, it's different, but

17:03.360 --> 17:06.200
it still feels really good and fun and involved when you play the game.

17:06.200 --> 17:11.080
Yeah, it wasn't really sort of a eureka, hey, let's do Geometry Wars on the Wii or anything

17:11.080 --> 17:12.080
like that.

17:12.080 --> 17:16.440
It was built up, and we saw the new platforms, and we saw what they were capable of, and

17:16.440 --> 17:19.840
somebody sort of said, hey, it'd be kind of cool if we put Geometry Wars on here.

17:19.840 --> 17:23.840
So we did, and then it built up and built up, and then we got the guys at Sierra involved,

17:23.840 --> 17:28.840
and they put Kuju in, and it just sort of built up into a full game over time.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.800
Did you guys put motion control in the game?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.660
I haven't really been able to get a sense of that from what I've read initially.

17:33.660 --> 17:37.360
Is there motion, did you guys incorporate the Wii motion controls in the game?

17:37.360 --> 17:43.680
Yeah, I mean, what you do is you use the, you point with the wand, and you use the nunchuck

17:43.680 --> 17:50.080
to move around, sorry, I'm full of a cold at the moment, it's all very difficult to

17:50.080 --> 17:51.080
speak.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.080
That's alright.

17:52.080 --> 17:57.760
So it's, yeah, so we've got the controls working on that, it works a little bit like a keyboard

17:57.760 --> 18:01.960
and mouse in a way that the controls work, but it does feel really nice, and obviously

18:01.960 --> 18:05.920
on the DS we support the stylus, so it works that way.

18:05.920 --> 18:06.920
Very cool.

18:06.920 --> 18:11.840
So the motion, so you're kind of like aiming either with the Wii mode or the stylus in

18:11.840 --> 18:16.040
the case of the DS version, and then moving with the control, with the nunchuck or the

18:16.040 --> 18:17.040
directional pad.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.440
That's right, yeah.

18:18.440 --> 18:19.440
Okay.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.720
Now you mentioned about kind of exploring the various platforms when you were taking,

18:23.720 --> 18:29.040
or I guess kind of developing on the Wii, and then kind of finding the Geometry Wars

18:29.040 --> 18:31.000
was a good fit for the Wii.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.480
What made you guys decide to kind of release this as its own standalone game, as opposed

18:35.480 --> 18:40.080
to maybe something on the WiiWare service or a downloadable title very similar to what

18:40.080 --> 18:41.080
it was on Xbox?

18:41.080 --> 18:46.520
I think, well, I mean the DS obviously hasn't got anything like that, and the amount of

18:46.520 --> 18:50.640
fans that come back and say they'd love to be able to play the game on the move is really

18:50.640 --> 18:54.240
high, so it made sense to work on the DS.

18:54.240 --> 19:00.440
The Wii game, I mean WiiWare still is quite a way off, well, it's getting closer now,

19:00.440 --> 19:06.560
but at the time, yeah, it was just a way to take the game across to the new people.

19:06.560 --> 19:13.480
I mean, we're not going for full retail price, it's going for a competitive price as well.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.760
So you get a lot of gameplay there.

19:16.760 --> 19:20.360
I was going to ask about that, because that's probably going to be a real shift for a lot

19:20.360 --> 19:25.000
of people who, you know, the Geometry Wars was really known on the Xbox for being a very

19:25.000 --> 19:29.600
cheap $5 title, and although Geometry Wars is going to be a budget title on the Wii,

19:29.600 --> 19:33.480
there's still going to be a little increase in money for people who are now going to the

19:33.480 --> 19:36.220
old-fashioned DVD and box format.

19:36.220 --> 19:41.520
What can people expect to get for the extra money they're going to be spending?

19:41.520 --> 19:46.800
It's a whole new campaign mode, since it gives you, sort of like 60 versions of Geometry

19:46.800 --> 19:53.560
Wars, new enemies, you've got different sort of grid shapes, which makes a huge difference

19:53.560 --> 19:58.240
in the way you play certain levels and the strategies, you've also got a drone, which

19:58.240 --> 20:03.840
is one of the big new additions, you've got an autonomous drone, over the game you build

20:03.840 --> 20:08.400
experience on this drone, you can nurture it to get new skills, that can give you more

20:08.400 --> 20:16.080
battle strategies when you play the game, so there's a lot more there, it's also got

20:16.080 --> 20:21.880
the original retro involved in there as well for fans of the game, and also the big one

20:21.880 --> 20:27.720
as well, we've got multiplayer as well, which is also a nice new addition to the series.

20:27.720 --> 20:31.960
We did sort of see those questions come in when we first sort of came up with this whole

20:31.960 --> 20:36.680
concept, we did think that, hey, how are we going to justify charging however amount of

20:36.680 --> 20:41.520
money to buy this game, and you know, we've really thrown in a hell of a lot of gameplay

20:41.520 --> 20:45.280
to make it worthwhile for people, we don't want anyone to feel ripped off once they've

20:45.280 --> 20:49.240
bought the game, but I don't think they will, because as Craig says, there's absolutely

20:49.240 --> 20:52.120
loads of content in them.

20:52.120 --> 20:56.280
All right, very cool, it does sound like, I like the comparison there, it's like Geometry

20:56.280 --> 21:01.960
Wars retro is just kind of one level, whereas this new one's going to be about 60 and has

21:01.960 --> 21:05.200
the upgrades and everything, that sounds pretty awesome.

21:05.200 --> 21:08.600
One other thing that really caught my eye, because I don't see a lot of people doing

21:08.600 --> 21:13.320
this on the Nintendo Wii right now, save one in-house Nintendo game I can think of, is

21:13.320 --> 21:18.000
that you have the Wii and the DS functioning together in Geometry Wars.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.800
Tell me a little more about how this works in the game.

21:19.800 --> 21:26.440
Yeah, I mean if you have, there's quite a few ways of interconnecting the two platforms

21:26.440 --> 21:27.440
work.

21:27.440 --> 21:32.880
You can, if you have both versions of the game, you can unlock an extra solar system

21:32.880 --> 21:37.880
within the game, with new unique maps and battles, so that's a reward people have brought

21:37.880 --> 21:39.880
on both platforms.

21:39.880 --> 21:44.600
Also, if you've just got the Wii version, or just the DS version, you can upload the

21:44.600 --> 21:50.040
whole retro evolved to your DS or your friend's DS.

21:50.040 --> 21:54.960
So again, a lot more people play in the game, that's the theory behind all of this.

21:54.960 --> 22:01.920
So by doing that with one card reach, in the office a lot of people can be playing on multiplayer

22:01.920 --> 22:02.920
games.

22:02.920 --> 22:03.920
Things like that.

22:03.920 --> 22:07.320
We try to be as generous as we can with the game.

22:07.320 --> 22:11.640
And I noticed the Wi-Fi seal on the game too, does that mean you've got the online leaderboards

22:11.640 --> 22:12.640
in that too?

22:12.640 --> 22:15.360
That's right, yeah, we support full online leaderboards.

22:15.360 --> 22:20.240
One of the caveats of the game is we wouldn't do it if we couldn't support online leaderboards.

22:20.240 --> 22:24.280
Because no matter how good you are, you want to see how good you are against your friends

22:24.280 --> 22:26.360
and against everyone else in the world.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.360
Awesome.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.920
Well, where do you guys see Geometry Wars going in the future?

22:29.920 --> 22:36.320
Do you think there's a possibility of something based on Geometry Wars waves when, if the

22:36.320 --> 22:40.440
Nintendo Wii version, DS versions are successful at continuing and growing of the franchise

22:40.440 --> 22:41.760
on the Nintendo platforms?

22:41.760 --> 22:47.600
Yeah, I mean, Geometry Wars is something that is its own beast and it's moving on in its

22:47.600 --> 22:49.600
own mysterious past at the moment.

22:49.600 --> 22:55.840
So there's definitely things that we're considering in the future and looking at at the moment.

22:55.840 --> 23:00.680
It's great to be very careful with what he says, because I'm sort of holding a hammer

23:00.680 --> 23:04.400
over his head at the moment saying, we haven't announced this yet!

23:04.400 --> 23:10.080
But no, we're always looking at expanding, you know, there's a big fan base for the game

23:10.080 --> 23:15.040
and we listen to our fans and we're trying to set aside them and get more people playing

23:15.040 --> 23:16.040
the game.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.360
Well, best of luck to you guys.

23:17.360 --> 23:22.200
I hope the cats sell tons and tons of copies of Geometry Wars, because it certainly is

23:22.200 --> 23:27.000
a, you know, Geometry Wars Retro was definitely one of my favorite Xbox Live download titles

23:27.000 --> 23:30.320
and you gotta love the cats advertised in the game.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.400
You definitely know you can trust them.

23:32.400 --> 23:37.400
But I gotta ask you, since I understand, Craig, you're the game manager not only over Geometry

23:37.400 --> 23:39.640
Wars, but you also worked on Boom Boom Rocket, right?

23:39.640 --> 23:40.640
That's right.

23:40.640 --> 23:41.640
Yeah.

23:41.640 --> 23:45.440
Now, our radio station actually started based around music-based video games.

23:45.440 --> 23:49.080
So we, you know, obviously snatched up Boom Boom Rocket when it first came out.

23:49.080 --> 23:54.020
I'm kind of curious, is there going to be content in the future, maybe some expansions

23:54.020 --> 23:58.960
on the songs in Boom Boom Rocket or a continuation of that franchise in one way or another?

23:58.960 --> 24:02.920
Yeah, there's more to come from the world of Boom Boom Rocket.

24:02.920 --> 24:09.200
I don't know exactly what I can say about that, but we've made additional content and

24:09.200 --> 24:13.160
hopefully it's going to be releasing, but there's still all sorts of caveats that we

24:13.160 --> 24:17.600
need to sort out with the publisher and Xbox Live Marketplace and all that sort of stuff.

24:17.600 --> 24:21.000
So hopefully there will be something, but I don't want to commit to anything because

24:21.000 --> 24:23.480
I don't know the details, to be honest.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.480
Understandable.

24:24.480 --> 24:25.680
I understand there's got to be secrets.

24:25.680 --> 24:29.120
Well, thank you guys so much for being on the show today, but before I let you guys

24:29.120 --> 24:33.080
go, we always ask all our guests that come on the program, we want to know how is your

24:33.080 --> 24:34.080
gaming week?

24:34.080 --> 24:39.360
What kind of video games have you been playing besides the ones at the office?

24:39.360 --> 24:46.400
I've been playing Halo 3, obviously, Halo 3, and I've been playing Board of Ag on the

24:46.400 --> 24:49.640
Dreamcast because it's a great show.

24:49.640 --> 24:55.120
I've been playing Halo 3 as well, and I've just finished World in Conflict on PC, that's

24:55.120 --> 24:59.080
awesome, I really, really love that, but I've been playing Halo 3 and then when Gotham hits

24:59.080 --> 25:03.000
the shelves in the UK, I'll be playing that some more as well and beating all of our community

25:03.000 --> 25:07.680
on that, or losing horribly to all of me on that, but yeah.

25:07.680 --> 25:11.800
Sounds pretty awesome, I mean, I think the entire internet is playing Halo 3 right now,

25:11.800 --> 25:16.280
but I have to ask the question, definitive question on Halo 3, do you prefer co-op or

25:16.280 --> 25:17.280
competitive?

25:17.280 --> 25:18.280
Co-op.

25:18.280 --> 25:19.280
Competitive.

25:19.280 --> 25:25.000
Ah, dissension amongst the ranks, all right.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.120
You know, whoever said co-op, I'd be wary of the guy who said competitive there, and

25:30.120 --> 25:38.200
well, thank you guys so much for being on the programme this week, is there anything

25:38.200 --> 25:43.160
else you want to share with our listeners about the upcoming products at Bazaar?

25:43.160 --> 25:47.360
Just hope, you know, you keep checking our website and see the stuff we're announcing

25:47.360 --> 25:51.040
and give us feedback and we do listen to it.

25:51.040 --> 25:56.160
Yeah, it's a very busy time at Bazaar right now, so I mean, we're just looking for everyone

25:56.160 --> 25:59.640
to tell us what they think, tell us what they like, tell us what they don't like, and we're

25:59.640 --> 26:03.280
going to build it into all our future projects and stuff, we welcome as much feedback as

26:03.280 --> 26:08.240
we can get, so yeah, just stop by the website and shout on us, we like it.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.240
And the website link for our listeners?

26:10.240 --> 26:12.240
Oh, that's www.bazaarcreations.com.

26:12.240 --> 26:19.600
All right, www.bazaarcreations.com for more information on such games like Geometry Wars

26:19.600 --> 26:23.320
Galaxies and Boom Boom Rocket and things we didn't even touch on today like Project Gotham

26:23.320 --> 26:25.120
Racing and so on.

26:25.120 --> 26:28.080
Craig and Ben, thank you guys so much for being on the programme this week.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.080
Thanks a lot.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.080
Cheers.

26:30.080 --> 26:41.520
All right, well, thank you very much to those folks from Bazaar Creations for joining us.

26:41.520 --> 26:43.200
That was Craig, Howard and Ben Wharton.

26:43.200 --> 26:47.680
I have to actually kind of give a little bit of personal apologies because the whole time

26:47.680 --> 26:52.720
zone thing, I said I would interview them at 2 o'clock their time and I thought for

26:52.720 --> 26:57.160
some reason when I looked it up on the internet, it said 7 a.m. but it actually ended up being

26:57.160 --> 27:00.320
6 a.m. so I roll out of bed at like 6.30 and I check my email, they're like, we're waiting

27:00.320 --> 27:01.320
for you to call.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.320
I'm like, oh, no.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.320
Time's up.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.840
They were very good and very accommodating and they came back even though I was hideously

27:05.840 --> 27:10.160
late and unprofessional so big thanks to those guys for coming on the programme.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.160
So cool.

27:11.160 --> 27:15.200
All right, and I got to say, just so you guys know, we're having some problems in our studio

27:15.200 --> 27:19.080
right now so the live listeners unfortunately are locked out right now.

27:19.080 --> 27:23.160
Basically the way it works is we have a big desktop computer that streams the internet

27:23.160 --> 27:27.040
through our wireless network and up until now, it's been doing just fine but tonight

27:27.040 --> 27:31.240
for whatever reason, the mainframe computer is not speaking to the wireless network.

27:31.240 --> 27:36.000
It went down during that taped interview so we're on laptop power right now but unfortunately,

27:36.000 --> 27:39.720
I am locked out of chat but I believe Dark Sakura used to have a connection to the chat

27:39.720 --> 27:43.380
room but unfortunately the chat room can't hear our programme because the desktop computer's

27:43.380 --> 27:47.920
down and not streaming to live 365.

27:47.920 --> 27:52.320
It would, actually your mic's off too so they can't hear you but I know we're having all

27:52.320 --> 27:53.320
sorts of problems tonight.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.320
I'm in the chat.

27:54.320 --> 27:57.320
Tonight's the kind of night where we just need to quit.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.320
No, that's all right.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.520
Hey, let's go quit and get fries.

28:00.520 --> 28:01.520
That's all right.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.880
We're going to just keep going with the show.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.640
If the stream comes back in time, we'll do some Skype calls.

28:06.640 --> 28:10.120
If not, unfortunately I guess this will be one for the tapes only.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.120
What else can you do?

28:11.120 --> 28:13.880
So we're going to go back to Loki with some gaming news.

28:13.880 --> 28:14.880
Awesome.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.880
I get a mic.

28:16.880 --> 28:23.480
Anyways, so yeah, some fun information other than bizarre stuff.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.040
Let's see here.

28:25.040 --> 28:31.680
Our friends over all games of course, they have some ties with G4 and stuff and this

28:31.680 --> 28:35.960
all goes back to of course Video Games Live.

28:35.960 --> 28:41.080
Video Games Live, a wonderful show that's been going for a few years now I believe.

28:41.080 --> 28:45.360
This year they, or at least I guess for the next year, they've got 25 new shows across

28:45.360 --> 28:52.240
the US announced in their tour with a couple in Canada, one in London actually.

28:52.240 --> 28:56.320
Of course this year they're going to have a new concert including music from Halo 3,

28:56.320 --> 29:01.800
Bioshock, Conan, and Starcraft 2.

29:01.800 --> 29:07.680
That's pretty cool and of course it's a little bit different than say your usual concerts,

29:07.680 --> 29:10.840
all video game music, all done by an orchestra.

29:10.840 --> 29:11.840
Very cool.

29:11.840 --> 29:16.280
If you're in the area of one of those concerts, definitely worth checking out.

29:16.280 --> 29:21.880
All righty, well you know the game Rock Band, if you want to have a concert of your own,

29:21.880 --> 29:25.360
you're going to get this game Rock Band because it is going to have the guitars and the keyboards,

29:25.360 --> 29:28.080
I'm sorry not the keyboards, I wish I had the keyboards, it's going to have the drum

29:28.080 --> 29:33.200
set and the vocals and tambourines because you can use the microphone as a tambourine.

29:33.200 --> 29:36.760
Well unfortunately the only way you're going to be able to get this game is in a bundle

29:36.760 --> 29:37.880
form.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.400
It's going to be bundle only in the year 2007.

29:40.400 --> 29:44.560
You cannot get these separate peripherals until 2008.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.480
Bundle only or game only, that's your only option.

29:46.480 --> 29:50.880
But you can't get the actual guitar itself which is interesting because I went on All

29:50.880 --> 29:54.520
Games Radio, I was doing the typical Monday plug because our show simulcast there so I

29:54.520 --> 29:58.640
usually go on on Mondays to kind of plug the show that's coming up and one of the chatters

29:58.640 --> 30:02.560
said I was wrong and that there was, because I thought for some reason I had heard this

30:02.560 --> 30:06.760
earlier that only the bundle was going to be out in 2007 but they said I was wrong.

30:06.760 --> 30:10.360
No, EA's been telling us that's what's been going on.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.440
And now it was confirmed for the public this week.

30:12.440 --> 30:16.160
Now what I'm thinking, maybe there was like a third party, like are third party controllers

30:16.160 --> 30:17.160
going to be out and available?

30:17.160 --> 30:18.160
Of course, right?

30:18.160 --> 30:19.160
Maybe.

30:19.160 --> 30:22.480
So maybe that's what it is but as far as the official first party peripherals, unfortunately

30:22.480 --> 30:26.360
those are not going to be out until 2008.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.360
Sorry guys.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.600
So it's going to cost you 170 bucks to play a rock band unless you want to use your existing

30:30.600 --> 30:32.960
guitars or microphones.

30:32.960 --> 30:36.680
Well this one's sort of interesting to me although it's interesting in a quite different

30:36.680 --> 30:39.840
way than probably how they're listing it.

30:39.840 --> 30:49.960
There's a group of graduate students that have mapped video game controllers onto different

30:49.960 --> 30:59.040
types of wearable fabrics where you can give massages while playing video games.

30:59.040 --> 31:06.040
And on their website they give instructions on how to make one for yourself.

31:06.040 --> 31:11.720
But I want to watch the video on this however it's not loaded up and given that I am a massage

31:11.720 --> 31:19.600
therapist I have definite reservations for how safe this is because I know from personal

31:19.600 --> 31:23.600
experience if you do it wrong you can fuck somebody up.

31:23.600 --> 31:30.080
I mean that's why we have to go to school for however many hours and learn how to do

31:30.080 --> 31:31.440
it right.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.920
Let me ask your professional opinion, quote unquote, since you have gone to the school,

31:34.920 --> 31:36.240
got the training and all that stuff.

31:36.240 --> 31:40.160
There's a lot of people though that give the casual massages you know like in the privacy

31:40.160 --> 31:44.120
of their own home like, oh baby I could really use a massage right now you know and no training

31:44.120 --> 31:45.360
and that stuff right.

31:45.360 --> 31:50.000
So as long as they're not applying a lot of pressure though as long as it's like a I don't

31:50.000 --> 31:53.020
know what I'm doing type massage do you think it's okay?

31:53.020 --> 32:00.100
Actually you can, this is just going from what they said in school, touch is very important

32:00.100 --> 32:08.960
for people and even if it's really light there's still a lot of emotion that you can bring

32:08.960 --> 32:16.520
out in another person, a lot of if they've got to say that they have a circulatory issue

32:16.520 --> 32:22.120
you can actually cause problems with that, lymphatic problems you can move the length

32:22.120 --> 32:28.340
in their skin and you have to be you, you have to be kind of careful, well they actually

32:28.340 --> 32:34.960
have a full on hospital grade lymphatic massage for people like, for example a lot of women

32:34.960 --> 32:40.640
who've had mastectomies they remove a lot of the lymph nodes and so you'll see these

32:40.640 --> 32:46.080
deposits in their arms under their armpits from excess lymph drainage.

32:46.080 --> 32:55.040
And so you run into when any one who's not a professional tries to give and it seems

32:55.040 --> 33:00.000
to me that for to use a controller like this that have to be using a bit of pressure don't

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
you think?

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Yeah.

33:02.000 --> 33:09.020
So they run into a lot of risk with especially listening to me they're doing around the center

33:09.020 --> 33:13.600
back you're dealing with problems dealing with the spine you can get into some nerve

33:13.600 --> 33:18.440
damage everything the way it connects I would not agree with letting an unprofessional.

33:18.440 --> 33:24.100
I'm looking at the official website for this massage-me.at is the official site for this

33:24.100 --> 33:28.040
I don't see anything on the front page about you know doctor tests or anything now granted

33:28.040 --> 33:31.240
I have not you know to this website's credit because I don't want to misrepresent anything

33:31.240 --> 33:34.800
I've not looked through and through all these different pages that are here so I don't know

33:34.800 --> 33:39.280
if they have any type of hey the doctor says it's okay but this looks like you know university

33:39.280 --> 33:44.940
students to me I'm looking at this university students idea of you know something innovative

33:44.940 --> 33:51.480
so yes it's innovative but could it be dangerous possibly I don't know I'm checking out their

33:51.480 --> 33:55.240
thanks I'm trying to look at their blog yeah their thanks didn't say any doctor there's

33:55.240 --> 34:04.240
nothing on here about being an actual professional massage therapist I'm looking at and they're

34:04.240 --> 34:09.280
they're very true you know massage is very good for you and I know this from experience

34:09.280 --> 34:15.940
but at the same point they have if they're not professional they don't have anything

34:15.940 --> 34:23.260
on there listening any kind of credentials I would not condone having this type of thing

34:23.260 --> 34:27.040
yeah I mean you know to enter these guys credit you know I don't want to again misrepresented

34:27.040 --> 34:31.340
or whatever it seems like a really interesting idea and you know certainly they're thinking

34:31.340 --> 34:35.120
outside the box but just for their own sake I hope they've consulted a doctor on it because

34:35.120 --> 34:38.220
I don't see anything on the site they don't really have to consult a doctor just to consult

34:38.220 --> 34:43.080
another massage therapist I'm confused you do the massage on somebody yes on the person

34:43.080 --> 34:49.740
they're wearing this jacket that has the contacts in it oh and now if it's something like you

34:49.740 --> 34:56.320
were saying like a little light you know massage then that's one thing but if you're and it

34:56.320 --> 35:02.180
seems to me that if you're trying to play a game by doing it then turn out well then

35:02.180 --> 35:08.660
now the only other thing that I know what might be good is having your feedback go through

35:08.660 --> 35:12.240
the jacket sometimes when I get mad at the games I throw the controller against the wall

35:12.240 --> 35:20.080
so I feel bad for the subject that has to be my massage well exactly you know you're

35:20.080 --> 35:24.840
it seems to me that you'd be putting repetitive pressure in the same continuous area it'd

35:24.840 --> 35:29.280
just be like having someone punch you in the back over and over and over again like mash

35:29.280 --> 35:33.560
the b button mash the b button where wait sorry I just dislocated your shoulder where

35:33.560 --> 35:44.760
the concept is interesting I would not and okay there's there's actually a list on here

35:44.760 --> 35:49.880
that's telling how you know how to do it but they're not doing it right you're doing it

35:49.880 --> 35:57.120
wrong you're doing it wrong all right well if you want more information on that it's

35:57.120 --> 36:01.320
called massage me so we don't want to take too much time talking about it because we're

36:01.320 --> 36:05.680
not a massage podcast but I do not condone this and on top of that I'm actually going

36:05.680 --> 36:10.680
to be referring the site to the director of my school because this is actually potentially

36:10.680 --> 36:23.480
very dangerous narc anyway anyways so anyway Konami's made a little boo-boo or somebody

36:23.480 --> 36:29.160
has made a little boo-boo as far as advertising the brand new Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles

36:29.160 --> 36:36.320
unfortunately the Beaumonts have now become the Beaumonts so I don't know it's a different

36:36.320 --> 36:42.600
family that's destroying Dracula it's just you know quite a coincidence that their names

36:42.600 --> 36:48.240
are so close together and of course there's been you know mistakes and ads before including

36:48.240 --> 36:57.720
an ad for Tony Hawk's downhill Jam which was advertised as being on the Sony Wii so I don't

36:57.720 --> 37:05.300
know mistakes happen much like the show the proofreaders out there are getting fired as

37:05.300 --> 37:13.500
we speak what can we say all right the gods and heroes MMO is on indefinite hiatus we're

37:13.500 --> 37:19.000
sorry to say unfortunately gods and heroes Rome rising was supposed to be this MMO that

37:19.000 --> 37:24.100
was being developed by perpetual entertainment well the perpetual co-founder Chris McKibben

37:24.100 --> 37:29.920
has posted an open letter saying stating the basically we were too ambitious in the terms

37:29.920 --> 37:34.120
of the game's development and now that we're going to be shelving this title the team will

37:34.120 --> 37:39.800
now have time to focus their attention elsewhere such as the Star Trek online MMO that's being

37:39.800 --> 37:44.900
worked on by the same company so while this might be good news for Star Trek fans who

37:44.900 --> 37:50.120
are hoping to see you know the best game possible for the Star Trek MMO this is kind of a bad

37:50.120 --> 37:54.820
news for all those people who unfortunately lost their jobs over this and one of those

37:54.820 --> 37:59.120
folks you might know who is working on the gods and heroes MMO you know our buddy Renee

37:59.120 --> 38:04.200
who comes to the show sometimes unfortunately this affected her so on her behalf we will

38:04.200 --> 38:29.000
dedicate this week's FUs of the week FU goes to the security at my work for saying oh there's

38:29.000 --> 38:38.440
nothing we can do which was bullshit pure and utter stinky bullshit so I am going to

38:38.440 --> 38:44.160
go back and take a photo of the license tag of that car say they can't find them oh fuck

38:44.160 --> 38:51.680
you I can find them easily I saw them just the other day and I have a very good camera

38:51.680 --> 38:59.440
I am not going I am not going to stop until justice is served judge Jamie's on the case

38:59.440 --> 39:06.560
and if they decide to do nothing else I'm going to address it with our CEO about how

39:06.560 --> 39:11.440
ineffectual our security is I'm sorry to hear that follow-up also kind of screwed up story

39:11.440 --> 39:18.160
you told last week on the show so that's kind of unfortunate oh yes F that oh yes all right

39:18.160 --> 39:24.440
because remember when I have my mind set to something I get results anything else anything

39:24.440 --> 39:32.840
else fuck a whole bunch of that shit Loki I guess fuck you the fact that there's not

39:32.840 --> 39:37.360
a lot of good games are you know I mean it's a bit of a lull until like next few weeks

39:37.360 --> 39:42.640
when there's a ton of shit coming out so I need more stuff to play I need more time to

39:42.640 --> 39:50.560
play it in two I'll go next and then we'll go to puppy and Chris my F you the week obviously

39:50.560 --> 39:54.440
goes to the sad state of disrepair this show is in tonight I have no idea what's going

39:54.440 --> 39:58.520
on but between the audio problems and now we have our internet problems that we don't

39:58.520 --> 40:02.060
have the live listeners right now we're pretty much doing Part B for tape this week it's

40:02.060 --> 40:07.240
like poltergeist is in the house tonight I don't know what the hell is going on I apologize

40:07.240 --> 40:11.120
to the listeners I don't know what's up shit happens though what you expect you get what

40:11.120 --> 40:15.640
you pay for right it's a free program what can you say and we try our best we got to

40:15.640 --> 40:19.280

to kind of take some responsibility for her fucking actions and neat and also this is

40:59.560 --> 41:05.040
the biggest one needs to realize that if you cannot accept the consequences of having a

41:05.040 --> 41:11.040

41:11.040 --> 41:17.560

into them damn woman all right I'm done all right that's gonna do it for the FUs the week

42:57.320 --> 43:01.200
unfortunately the poltergeist still affecting our network we're still not live mm-hmm bummer

43:01.200 --> 43:08.520
I know it's like Halloween this place is haunted what oh thank you Chris got a little picture

43:08.520 --> 43:16.920
of the kitty wait I'll fix it thanks thanks just what I need well maybe the mailbag will

43:16.920 --> 43:20.000
fix it because if this keeps up unfortunately we're not gonna be able to get to Skype tonight

43:20.000 --> 43:23.880
and I know some folks want to call in do some game reviews but at least there's the old

43:23.880 --> 43:27.920
mailbag and when you email us at mailbag at orange launch radio.com it's practically the

43:27.920 --> 43:31.540
old-fashioned way of interacting with a podcast at this point but when the newfangled stuff

43:31.540 --> 43:36.160
breaks we turn to the mailbag so mailbag orange launch radio.com dark soccer is gonna open

43:36.160 --> 43:49.840
it up pick some of her favorites right now hey listen it is time for the mailbag so first

43:49.840 --> 43:57.140
thing actually comes from Rob with two B's he sent a link to a story and this is very

43:57.140 --> 44:04.360
Darwin awardee in Moscow a 10 year old kid suicide after parents banned computer games

44:04.360 --> 44:15.920
and just to his name was Andre Smirnoff which I'm not gonna see anything who was a class

44:15.920 --> 44:24.080
three student jumped to his death after his parents were blaming his bad conduct in school

44:24.080 --> 44:30.140
and performance in class on video games and he had made a comment about it in his diary

44:30.140 --> 44:36.960
and then jumped out of a window so I'm like yeah that just means that your kid was fucked

44:36.960 --> 44:44.880
in the head also and to continue with his email also I loved your me argument about

44:44.880 --> 44:50.320
microtransactions and other poorly named events if you really want to draw a line objectively

44:50.320 --> 44:58.640
a transaction in quotes is a payment in monetary units a microtransaction would be a one one

44:58.640 --> 45:04.600
thousandth of a transaction or less than one penny if you remember the office space in

45:04.600 --> 45:09.200
Belgium that scenario was based upon taking the money less than one cent off every transaction

45:09.200 --> 45:17.840
and adding them up so in that case and if you are using pure terminology a microtransaction

45:17.840 --> 45:24.360
would have to consist of less of one one thousandth of a penny so therefore the term microtransaction

45:24.360 --> 45:28.620
is actually an incorrect term I was right I'm not gonna have this stupid argument again

45:28.620 --> 45:35.920
I just well that's my whole thing that I hate about modern language use is this whole let's

45:35.920 --> 45:42.520
just completely define everything but use really well ROTFL no that's not what I'm talking

45:42.520 --> 45:56.100
about pre-boarding you know putting unnecessary prefixes towards George Carlin did point that

45:56.100 --> 46:01.420
out didn't he but but then again there's also literal and you know applied means of things

46:01.420 --> 46:07.080
for example micro machines were not one thousandth the size of a car actually I think that they

46:07.080 --> 46:13.560
were they were smaller okay I think that they were one thousand one thousand whatever shit

46:13.560 --> 46:18.120
there was smaller okay that's all that matters no one's gonna do the fucking scale shit it's

46:18.120 --> 46:23.980
not model building okay no fucking train sets here would you say this compares to how it

46:23.980 --> 46:29.120
works there's an item on the menu called the cheese quesadilla when it quesadilla literally

46:29.120 --> 46:33.400
means you know cheese so it's like you're ordering it it's like you're ordering a peanut

46:33.400 --> 46:38.440
peanut butter sandwich or something I you're ordering a cheese cheese sandwich like ordering

46:38.440 --> 46:46.220
chai tea because chai means tea so you know I think that it's more or less you everybody

46:46.220 --> 46:51.220
in the world is stupid let's accommodate the language to everybody's stupidity I don't

46:51.220 --> 46:53.620
like to... I do not like to live in the real world.

46:53.620 --> 46:56.700
Here's the Poltergeist again. Suddenly we're the language podcast tonight.

46:56.700 --> 46:59.860
No, that's all right. It's all good.

46:59.860 --> 47:03.580
I just honestly think that it's a reflection of society.

47:03.580 --> 47:07.780
Don't sign on to Xbox Live and listen to the way people talk because you will weep

47:07.780 --> 47:11.140
on behalf of society. Chris, stop distracting.

47:11.140 --> 47:14.380
Stop distracting Jamie while she's trying to read the mailbag.

47:14.380 --> 47:20.220
I love that site. She did though, she did show me the one I have in my cubicle

47:20.220 --> 47:24.060
with a picture of Captain Kirk saying, James T. Kirk. I'm sorry, I can't hear you

47:24.060 --> 47:25.340
over the sound of how awesome I am.

47:25.340 --> 47:29.900
Emails. Okay. This one comes from One Night Stands.

47:29.900 --> 47:34.700
Hello, I just recently started to listen to your podcast and I must say that I really like

47:34.700 --> 47:35.980
them as they don't bore me

47:35.980 --> 47:41.380
except for the Onion audio and video podcast. A few times on the show, Skye, I think,

47:41.380 --> 47:44.140
I'm still trying to figure out the difference between the two guys,

47:44.140 --> 47:48.100
has mentioned that he's gay. The first time I thought he was just...

47:48.100 --> 47:53.820
What? Nothing. Okay. The first time, I just thought he was just joking and then I was listening to your most

47:53.820 --> 47:54.680
recent one where

47:54.680 --> 47:58.020
Skye and Jamie went to the movies and started talking about the sanctity of

47:58.020 --> 48:01.220
marriage and then running off to Vegas to get married to immediately divorce.

48:01.220 --> 48:05.940
It's just something about being gay. And I know it's tacky to dig into other people's

48:05.940 --> 48:08.100
lives and find out what their sexual orientation is.

48:08.100 --> 48:11.580
I long for the days when people like Perez Hilton were branded with a

48:11.580 --> 48:13.700
scarlet letter, probably G for gossip,

48:13.700 --> 48:16.860
and I'd been wondering, are you gay? I res... No.

48:16.860 --> 48:21.380
No. Rob is... I'm very happy to be on this program.

48:21.380 --> 48:25.700
I think that it's great to hear that one of the three main people is. As a gay

48:25.700 --> 48:27.360
gamer, I think it's great to hear.

48:27.360 --> 48:30.900
It's great to see celebrities being out and proud and know the fan base is not

48:30.900 --> 48:33.980
swayed by their sexual preference. Skye, DarkSakuraLoki, keep up the good work.

48:33.980 --> 48:37.100
Is that person insinuating I'm a celebrity? Rad!

48:37.100 --> 48:40.500
Ooh, ego plus plus. And I look forward to

48:40.500 --> 48:45.100
hearing your next podcast. Thank you. P.S. my handle is a Simpsons reference.

48:45.100 --> 48:48.540
Everyone thinks it's a sex thing. Wow.

48:48.540 --> 48:52.020
It's One Night Stands. One Night Stands.

48:52.020 --> 48:55.180
Now that... usually that's what you'd find on gay.com, One Night Stands.

48:55.180 --> 48:58.540
Yeah, no, I'm Skye, the voice you hear right now is... or Rob.

48:58.540 --> 49:02.180
I don't really... not a lot of people call me Skye anymore, but Rob. And yeah, I'm gay.

49:02.180 --> 49:05.060
So, but that's not what the show's all about. The show's about video games. But I

49:05.060 --> 49:05.620
understand.

49:05.620 --> 49:09.340
I totally understand where you're coming from. Because sometimes I can kind of

49:09.340 --> 49:09.800
speak

49:09.800 --> 49:14.280
from experience. It's kinda hard to find. Gay gamers are in an interesting niche, I

49:14.280 --> 49:15.340
think, because in

49:15.340 --> 49:19.940
gaming culture, you know, obviously thanks to the Xbox Lives of the world where, you

49:19.940 --> 49:21.380
know, fag, fag, fag.

49:21.380 --> 49:25.580
You know, literally, I wear pink armor in Halo, okay? Because I think it's funny.

49:25.580 --> 49:26.420
It has...

49:26.420 --> 49:31.320
Lightest red. I wear it because I think it's funny and nobody else wears pink.

49:31.320 --> 49:35.580
I stand out. But, you know, somebody goes, oh, I just got killed by the fag in pink

49:35.580 --> 49:36.140
armor.

49:36.140 --> 49:40.300
Click, click, mute, warn. Love Halo 3. It's cause Rob is an attention whore.

49:40.300 --> 49:44.100
But, well, and then in the other side of it. So you have the gaming culture,

49:44.100 --> 49:48.360
you know, frowns on gays. To some extent. Obviously not everybody.

49:48.360 --> 49:51.940
It's a few bad apples ruining the barrel. But then you have in gay culture,

49:51.940 --> 49:56.460
you know, like, oh, you mean you don't shop at, you know, Nordstrom's and you don't

49:56.460 --> 50:00.660
listen to Madonna? And why don't you go to the club with us? Why do you have to stay home and play games?

50:00.660 --> 50:05.700
Come on, let's go out, you know. Let's go get Madonna tickets for $250.

50:05.700 --> 50:09.740
And, you know, let's do crack. I don't know, you know, it's like...

50:09.740 --> 50:16.740
I'm not saying all gays are like that. But, unfortunately, you know, I felt

50:16.860 --> 50:20.660
that kind of judgment from some of those very superficial people that, you know,

50:20.660 --> 50:22.260
oh, you play games? That's like a,

50:22.260 --> 50:25.620
you know, that's a little kid thing. That's not a gay thing. Well, you know, who's to say?

50:25.620 --> 50:27.500
What is, what, you know, people

50:27.500 --> 50:30.820
like what they like. So, anyway, you know, and I don't

50:30.820 --> 50:34.740
like to usually advertise the fact I'm gay on the program because this is not the,

50:34.740 --> 50:37.980
oh my god, the really big gay podcast about video games.

50:37.980 --> 50:44.140
Okay, guys, I cannot wait to review Gears of War because that is hot.

50:44.140 --> 50:47.660
No, you missed Rob singing show tunes last week.

50:47.660 --> 50:51.060
We already busted out the show tunes last week. But, no, in all seriousness,

50:51.060 --> 50:54.820
again, it's just that, you know, it is what it is.

50:54.820 --> 50:58.860
I'm gay, but I also... I've been playing video games

50:58.860 --> 51:02.100
a lot longer than I've been dating men. Let's put it that way,

51:02.100 --> 51:05.220
I guess. I don't know. Yes, and Chris is a lesbian.

51:05.220 --> 51:08.700
Yes. I'm a very big dyke. Dyke,

51:08.700 --> 51:13.020
power, yo. I like boobies. But, most of all,

51:13.020 --> 51:16.420
we like games, so that's what it really boils down to.

51:16.420 --> 51:22.100
And boobies. I like boobies, too, so that's, I guess, something every... I think it's a unanimous vote in this room that boobies are great.

51:22.100 --> 51:23.180
Boobies, yes.

51:23.180 --> 51:26.980
All right, all in favor of boobies? Aye. All opposed?

51:26.980 --> 51:31.620
I was too late on the, I was too late on the four

51:31.620 --> 51:35.780
boobies. All right. The Pokemon does not like boobies.

51:35.780 --> 51:39.460
So, I don't know what else to say to that email, but,

51:39.460 --> 51:43.700
okay, I think it's... I'm gonna have to tell William that somebody couldn't figure it out.

51:43.700 --> 51:47.540
What? I'm kidding. Here's the thing, though.

51:47.540 --> 51:51.700
Perez Hilton totally sold out. Like, he used to be cool, like, a year ago, but

51:51.700 --> 51:52.820
totally sold out.

51:52.820 --> 51:56.500
You gotta find some new blogs to read, dude. Sorry. Perez Hilton kinda sold out.

51:56.500 --> 51:59.820
Drawing coke coming out of people's noses isn't funny anymore, sorry to say.

51:59.820 --> 52:03.900
Yeah, that website. The Gossip Blogger.

52:03.900 --> 52:07.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Anyway, sorry.

52:07.180 --> 52:10.580
Next email. Next email. Hey, okay, good God, this is such

52:10.580 --> 52:14.380
awful spelling. I'm sorry, whoever you are.

52:14.380 --> 52:18.420
I'm sorry. One more thing on the gay thing, because I forgot to mention this. Praise

52:18.420 --> 52:22.420
and happy thoughts and thank yous to the folks who make websites

52:22.420 --> 52:27.460
for the minorities in whatever cultures. In this case, I'm talking

52:27.460 --> 52:30.740
gay gamers, but whatever cultures, to come together. So specifically, I'm talking

52:30.740 --> 52:31.980
like gaygamer.net,

52:31.980 --> 52:35.300
I'm talking the gamers experimentation forums, and all those other little niche places on the

52:35.300 --> 52:35.740
internet

52:35.740 --> 52:38.900
for, you know, people that feel like, you know, like,

52:38.900 --> 52:42.780
gosh, I feel like abnormal because

52:42.780 --> 52:46.300
I like games and I'm gay and the two don't go together. It's like oil and

52:46.300 --> 52:46.820
water.

52:46.820 --> 52:51.420
Praise to those people that make the niches on the internet for those

52:51.420 --> 52:52.700
kind of people to find each other.

52:52.700 --> 52:56.460
And I'm just talking in general, too. Not just gay and gaming, but all types of

52:56.460 --> 53:00.100
minorities. So, hooray.

53:00.100 --> 53:03.540
Now we can move on. Hey OrangeLunch, I'm kinda a new listener, but I already say

53:03.540 --> 53:04.500
you guys rock.

53:04.500 --> 53:08.380
I do have a question. You talk about Final Fantasy a lot, but I've never heard

53:08.380 --> 53:10.260
you talk about Final Fantasy X.

53:10.260 --> 53:13.860
Is there a reason, as I've been playing it a lot recently, this is from

53:13.860 --> 53:18.260
Lycan. Wait, am I on crack or wasn't there an email last week where we talked about Final Fantasy X?

53:18.260 --> 53:22.140
I swear to God it came up like last week or two weeks ago. I think we did talk about Final Fantasy X.

53:22.140 --> 53:25.140
Maybe this person's behind in their podcast listening, so we'll give them a

53:25.140 --> 53:25.860
bye, but

53:25.860 --> 53:29.940
that and Final Fantasy X's fucking old.

53:29.940 --> 53:33.380
I mean, if we're on Final Fantasy XII now, no seriously,

53:33.380 --> 53:36.780
played that game like years ago. It was an awesome game,

53:36.780 --> 53:39.780
but it was years ago. 10-2, not so great.

53:39.780 --> 53:42.860
The fandom has it, they're still on 8.

53:42.860 --> 53:46.620
Oh my God, the fandom for X. The fandom for X, I mean,

53:46.620 --> 53:51.620
you go to any, you know, anime convention guaranteed you're gonna see

53:51.620 --> 53:54.780
a tubby Yuna somewhere, always.

53:54.780 --> 53:58.220
Always. So the fandom is never gonna die.

53:58.220 --> 54:01.660
And then, you know, a Waka with a pooch, you know.

54:01.660 --> 54:08.140
You know what really bothers me is the pregnant fetish fan art.

54:08.140 --> 54:11.940
What? It's on DeviantArt, all over DeviantArt.

54:11.940 --> 54:15.620
Okay, when I talked about the whole, like, minority

54:15.620 --> 54:19.500
subculture thing, maybe there are a few exceptions.

54:19.500 --> 54:22.740
Yeah, they have a big, big subculture

54:22.740 --> 54:26.100
of people who like, what is it, inflated

54:26.100 --> 54:29.540
art? Where basically they make girls, it's mostly girls.

54:29.540 --> 54:33.540
With boobs that are three times the size of their bodies? Exactly, and they're like,

54:33.540 --> 54:37.380
they're big, they're fat, like, way more physically than

54:37.380 --> 54:40.660
they should be. Like in any way, shape, or form. It's not physical, it's not physically

54:40.660 --> 54:42.140
possible for these people to breathe.

54:42.140 --> 54:45.660
You know, I think I need to rethink my argument on the counterculture thing.

54:45.660 --> 54:47.900
Maybe I need to rethink those kudos a little bit.

54:47.900 --> 54:52.540
I'm so hypocritical because I'm so sad, like, I sit there and I go,

54:52.540 --> 54:55.700
you know, I don't care what they, it's like, I don't have to look at that art,

54:55.700 --> 54:58.740
but then I see it on the favorites page, and I just go,

54:58.740 --> 55:02.860
that shit should not be here! Because it's so fucking,

55:02.860 --> 55:06.940
you know, most of it is really bad, too. Like, these people can't draw, but the only reason

55:06.940 --> 55:10.540
that it ends up on the favorite page is because some,

55:10.540 --> 55:13.580
there's a bunch of morons out there who are wanking to this,

55:13.580 --> 55:17.620
and it's disgusting. Are you sure they just aren't out of proportion just because they are bad

55:17.620 --> 55:18.140
artists?

55:18.140 --> 55:21.740
You know, sometimes I wonder, like, they accidentally got it really big.

55:21.740 --> 55:25.260
No, they draw fat very well. Yeah, I can show you.

55:25.260 --> 55:28.420
It's really disgusting. Yeah, I can draw fat. It's a circle

55:28.420 --> 55:31.780
with a stick for leg, stick for arm, stick for neck,

55:31.780 --> 55:35.980
circle for head. Oh, like the chicken Willy Wonka when she ate the blueberry thing.

55:35.980 --> 55:40.180
Yeah, okay.

55:40.180 --> 55:44.740
Next email, please.

55:44.740 --> 55:49.180
From Final Fantasy X to Snozberries, look, you're going to ask us a question like that, that's what

55:49.180 --> 55:49.780
you're going to get.

55:49.780 --> 55:53.020
Hey, O-L-R. What do you think of Final Fantasy X? Snozberries.

55:53.020 --> 55:56.660
Hey, O-L-R, it's Nintendo Maniac 64.

55:56.660 --> 56:01.220
I noticed something this week with the update for Kirby's Final Smash on the Smash

56:01.220 --> 56:02.140
Bros. Brawl site.

56:02.140 --> 56:05.380
If you compare the bottom of the Japanese webpage to the English or any other

56:05.380 --> 56:06.180
language page,

56:06.180 --> 56:10.740
you notice that the Japanese version has some kind of extra sound clip recording.

56:10.740 --> 56:13.860
Any idea what this might be? Unfortunately,

56:13.860 --> 56:16.940
Rob's computer is the primary. We cannot

56:16.940 --> 56:21.100
correctly answer this question. So, next! But I will hypothesize,

56:21.100 --> 56:24.100
since they're saying it's an audio thing, right? I will hypothesize.

56:24.100 --> 56:28.020
Perhaps it is a piece of work that has not been translated

56:28.020 --> 56:32.180
or brought over yet, or simply it was just an oversight. If it's Kirby, why would it have any

56:32.180 --> 56:35.740
words to it? I guess that's true. I think it's just an oversight then.

56:35.740 --> 56:39.100
I think you're being a little tinfoil hat-ish. I wouldn't worry just yet.

56:39.100 --> 56:42.700
I think it's just an oversight, so don't worry.

56:42.700 --> 56:49.100
Oh my God! What the hell

56:49.100 --> 56:53.100
is that?

56:53.100 --> 56:56.800
There's a picture on DeviantArt and it's on the

56:56.800 --> 57:00.340
favorites page, and it's actually a lot better than the most of the stuff. At least

57:00.340 --> 57:03.260
this girl is somewhat in proportion, but Jesus Christ.

57:03.260 --> 57:08.860
She looks like a walrus. She looks like she's about ready to go goo goo ka choo,

57:08.860 --> 57:11.780
okay, for one. Okay, for B,

57:11.780 --> 57:15.340
did you ever see, and this is great radio, by the way, because I'm responding to a picture

57:15.340 --> 57:18.900
for B, and I'm totally being a hypocrite right now with this whole thing that I said,

57:18.900 --> 57:20.500
you know, oh, the countercultures are great.

57:20.500 --> 57:23.940
Not this! Everything I said earlier, this

57:23.940 --> 57:27.420
is not a part of that. Do not want, exactly.

57:27.420 --> 57:32.180
Here's the thing, like, did you ever see that faces of death where the guy had

57:32.180 --> 57:33.620
elephantitis of the balls?

57:33.620 --> 57:37.820
That's what her tits look like. What?

57:37.820 --> 57:42.660
What web site? Is it DeviantArt?

57:42.660 --> 57:46.340
You want to have a fun time? Go to deviantart.com

57:46.340 --> 57:51.780
and in the search, type inflation and just watch the funny shit happen. I

57:51.780 --> 57:52.660
swear

57:52.660 --> 57:57.380
it's just like people that should not be. It looks like a bunch of

57:57.380 --> 58:02.060
freaking world record tumors, like I saw on Ripley's Believe It or Not. Or you know what?

58:02.060 --> 58:06.100
Or you know what? Don't, and go play video games instead.

58:06.100 --> 58:09.660
You'll thank us later. Sorry, oh no.

58:09.660 --> 58:15.660
That can't be real. It's like somebody's Halloween costumes. Now that's funny, if you see that.

58:15.660 --> 58:19.380
It looks like she has like

58:19.380 --> 58:23.380
beach balls for titties.

58:23.380 --> 58:28.220
Next email please. Do not want. Hey guys, I love the show. Just want to know if you've seen

58:28.220 --> 58:30.500
the masterpiece that is Dead Fantasy 1.

58:30.500 --> 58:35.860
Not check it out now. Congrats on another milestone. 250 is certainly an

58:35.860 --> 58:37.780
accomplishment for independent podcast.

58:37.780 --> 58:41.220
Pat yourselves on the ass. Thanks for reading this.

58:41.220 --> 58:44.980
Yeah, we did. That's from Rissimo. I know, I've seen it.

58:44.980 --> 58:48.740
Was it Tomonobu? No, that's

58:48.740 --> 58:52.460
not who did it. Who did it? Monty Oum is the guy that does

58:52.460 --> 58:56.780
those. And it's actually, it's really cool. You should check it out. Dead Fantasy and

58:56.780 --> 58:57.740
also Haloid.

58:57.740 --> 59:01.460
It is pretty neat. And then he has another one too, if you go to his DeviantArt page.

59:01.460 --> 59:04.860
He doesn't have any inflation pictures, unfortunately.

59:04.860 --> 59:09.620
He has some really kick ass stuff though. Like they have a picture of like Cloud as a chick

59:09.620 --> 59:14.460
on a bike. And it looks really good. But definitely check out like you know the

59:14.460 --> 59:17.020
Haloid and Dead Fantasy stuff. I'll have to show it

59:17.020 --> 59:20.260
in studio after the show. But it's

59:20.260 --> 59:24.740
seriously some kick ass wire food shit that's a lot of

59:24.740 --> 59:28.340
borrowed heavily from the Matrix. But really awesome. Check it out.

59:28.340 --> 59:33.740
That's it for the emails. How about something that has nothing to do with

59:33.740 --> 59:34.980
inflation? Chris,

59:34.980 --> 59:38.060
put the inflation away. I seriously,

59:38.060 --> 59:41.660
although seriously like part of me wants to like make the album art for Orange

59:41.660 --> 59:43.560
Lounge Radio this week. One of those pictures.

59:43.560 --> 59:48.020
If there weren't copyright issues I'd totally do it. But anyway, let's

59:48.020 --> 59:51.140
let's move on. Shout, Chris. I'm not looking at inflation.

59:51.140 --> 59:54.740
It's his fault. Alright, moving on. Loki, it's your turn.

59:54.740 --> 59:58.700
Anyway, let's get this

59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.980
train back in the tracks here.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:05.940
Anyways, Games for Windows Live is getting an update

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:09.660
in November as well. Of course you know normally Xbox Live does their

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.300
spring and fall updates. So it sounds around the time

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.300
we'll be seeing an update for Live as well on 360.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.300
But Games for Windows Live will become 1.2.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.740
And with that there's going to be some improvements to

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:26.100
actually some of the features that they have on there including new languages.

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:29.900
Now with Dutch. Twelve new gamer pics

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:34.860
and a network information viewer. So you can provide a simpler way to

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:38.180
troubleshoot connectivity issues and stuff like that.

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:41.900
So that's pretty cool. And

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:45.140
it looks like best of all the internet connection

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:48.860
they're saying that they're going to have offline achievements. So if your

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.260
internet connection is down

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.260
you can do that just like you can on normal 360.

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:59.980
Awesome!

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:04.580
Alrighty, well Prince of Persia is also going to be getting an update of their

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.300
own except kind of in the other way. They're going backwards.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:11.180
But that's not a bad thing because it's actually a prequel trilogy

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:14.220
for the Prince of Persia games. Of course these games are very popular.

01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.180
However, this is

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.180
a rumor so take it with a grain of salt.

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.860
But I could totally see something like this happening. I don't know. But anyway,

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:30.020
supposedly some early images have leaked from this. It's called Ghosts of the Pass.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.260
It's supposed to be coming out the second half of next year.

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:36.580
And according to the site this originally ran on, quote,

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:40.220
it's stylistically and gameplay wise the game has abandoned the dark edginess of the

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.080
last two titles

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.820
in favor of a fantastical cross between the sands of time

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:49.580
Ico and Zelda. I don't know. When you put it that way it sounds a little fanboyish to me.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:53.060
At the same time though that's about the time I think that the Prince of Persia movies are

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.580
supposed to be coming out as well.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.260
I mean obviously the Prince of Persia series is not a dead series.

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.540
So big fat duh that there's another game coming out.

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:05.540
But is it a prequel? That could be interesting.

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:08.580
And who knows? Maybe it's actually the movie version because maybe they're

01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.220
going in a different direction with the movie. Maybe it

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.540
isn't based on existing storyline and these games are there to support the movie.

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:16.940
Who knows? Theories abound everywhere.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:20.940
But we don't know for sure until next year.

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:26.780
Well, this is fairly interesting as far as something that may or may not be.

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:32.660
But one of the SNKs, to me one of the games that I like the best from them,

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:35.980
Magician Lord, has an ESRB rating.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:40.020
So it most likely will not be

01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:43.940
only for Japan. We could see it coming out on

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.020
the Virtual Console for Wii very soon.

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:50.540
That's what I gotta say about that.

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:54.100
Basically you go through all these different levels that you can

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:57.540
turn your character into different types of

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:00.740
I guess elemental type characters.

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:04.340
So it's a pretty good game. Magician Lord is pretty hardcore awesome.

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:07.620
Cool.

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:11.860
Anyways, other sorts of awesome.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:15.740
There was before a problem with the Bioshock PC version.

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:18.740
Of course people getting pissed off that you can only

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:22.700
have three different activations available for that. Well now they have

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:26.180
a brand new tool that's been released officially.

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:31.700
It's a activation revoke tool and will allow you to revoke some of the

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:36.180
activations that you have so that if you want to install on different PC

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:41.380
you can do that. It's basically allow you to race and reload copies of

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:44.300
Bioshock onto your PC as many times as you want

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:48.900
without using up one of your activation tokens provided you don't make any major

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:51.140
changes to your current hardware.

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:54.540
And of course the tool is downloadable on the Cult

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.460
of Rapture website.

01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:01.740
Awesome. At least they're trying to fix some stuff. Well this is the part of the show

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:04.620
where we would have opened it up to the Skype line to take some phone calls at

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.300
1-877-GAME-OLR but unfortunately

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:10.340
the system is down. The system is down.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:16.180
So unfortunately live radio you know if we were a tape show we could you know

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:17.660
futz with it and

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.380
put a band-aid on it and make it look like nothing ever happened but

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.140
unfortunately we're live and the tape still rolling from when we were

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.060
connected to

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:27.140
Live 365 and everybody was here in chat so

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:30.620
sadly we're gonna have to forego the Skype line tonight. However I just want to

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:34.180
remind folks they can call anytime because we often get emails from folks that say

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:34.620
you know

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:38.060
hey I want to call in sometime but you know I'm just not around on Sunday

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.180
nights it's a bad time for me.

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:43.060
Don't forget we have voicemail there at 1-877-GAME-OLR so if you wanted to call

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:43.580
in tonight

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.800
call in and leave a voicemail and we'll try to play it on next week's show.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.580
The only reason we haven't been playing voicemails lately is because we haven't been getting a

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:49.940
lot

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.700
but if we get some good ones we'll definitely play them. Just my only advice try to just

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:56.420
you know keep it under two minutes because when you go on and ramble and

01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:58.380
ramble it makes us want to play it less because you know

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:02.180
the show is for us to ramble and ramble. No. We want you guys to definitely have a say as

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:04.280
well so the Skype line is there or our email

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:08.740
mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and apologies to our live listeners who got

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:13.420
cut off tonight. What can I say? The show was just all kinds of broken tonight.

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:17.580
It's like this whole year old now quit curse. I don't know what else to say

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.380
but we will go around and get some last minute stories of which I'm sure Loki's

01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:21.100
gotta have some.

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:25.460
Yeah. What's up? Anyways let's see here there's some interesting pictures coming

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.340
out from Postal 3

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.860
one of which features a new gun apparently that's going to be in the

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:32.540
game

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:37.220
which features a guy's hand up a badger's ass

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:40.700
and he's firing a badger gun apparently

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:44.300
it's like laser badger or something like that so this is

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:47.540
and I gotta show this in in studio here real quick

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:50.700
Well you don't have to. Yes I do. Destructoid

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:54.260
ran a little interview based on that and I gotta say

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:58.580
I was already gonna buy this game I'm thinking I may buy two copies of this game

01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.100
because it's

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:03.940
it's fucking awesome looking so

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:09.140
go runny with scissors you know I gotta respect. Yeah well they'll be on the badger's ass.

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:12.780
Hey I gotta respect the fact that they leave

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:16.860
nothing to chance as far as offending people. Good luck getting this past the

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.100
ESRB though that's all I gotta say.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:24.500
Other fun stuff there's gonna be a new tool that's

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.700
I can't hold on I just have to say I can't wait for the YouTube where

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.740
somebody's gonna film themselves doing this to the

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:33.620
badger badger badger badger badger badger badger badger mushroom

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:38.300
like seriously let's take some over-unders on how long before those

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.220
YouTube show up

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:43.380
I say they show up before the game now that I've said that

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:46.700
somebody's gonna take that picture and put it on YouTube. Send us the link when you get it done.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:50.300
Now also a max console has

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:54.660
some pictures up of a brand new device it's an adapter to let you use

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:58.620
HDMI inputs on your first generation

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.380
Xbox 360 of course the ones without HDMI

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:06.380
and this is from the XCM 1080i

01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:10.460
HDMI and it's shaped like a disc and it plugs into the back of

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:14.500
your 360 where the normal AV stuff goes

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:19.740
and we'll do HDMI out and we'll also do DVI out so that's pretty fucking awesome

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:24.860
that's gonna be available. The other thing there's a Phantom Hourglass DS

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:27.820
bundle that's appeared on internet retail sites

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:32.420
this is for the UK so it's a nice silver color with

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.500
looks like some silkscreens of

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:40.340
Zelda from Phantom Hourglass and also the

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:43.580
Zelda Phantom Hourglass logo so that's kinda neat

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:48.340
and that's probably coming soon and also if you are pre-ordering Super Mario

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:50.180
Galaxy and you want a free

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:54.460
pre-order coin just make sure you pre-order your copies at Amazon Circuit

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:55.420
City, Fred Meyers,

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:59.060
Fry's Electronics, GameCrazyGameStop, Kmart

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:02.420
and many others

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:05.740
pretty much every single store out there so

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:09.260
yeah that's awesome and

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:13.340
finally and I'm sure you're gonna hear this about the time that

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:17.100
this podcast is released some wonderful information which

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:20.140
you know was gonna be for our live listeners but since they're not with us

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:23.660
I'll just save it for the part B

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:27.060
there is each year

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:31.180
the ESA does kind of a I guess a

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:35.740
charity drive with games last year

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:40.460
Sony got together and put some games a PlayStation 2 collection

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:45.260
together with a couple games now and this will be announced officially on

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:50.380
Tuesday and it's actually what's gonna be is three games

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:54.540
Robbie Bach of the ESA will announce the holiday bundle it's gonna feature three

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.580
Xbox 360 games including

01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:03.580
Cars Open Season and Fusion Frenzy 2 all for $29.99

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.140
and the proceeds will go to

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:11.780
you know basically helping the ESA

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:16.620
and I guess that's kinda neat last year their goal is basically to

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:20.260
deliver two million dollars to the ESA charity

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:23.500
and all the game publisher or let me just quote this right here

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.940
each year the ESA partners with key industry gaming platforms to create a

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:31.340
three game hard bundle which is

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:35.860
specially packaged with the messaging about the ESA and its charity status and

01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:37.020
sold through retail

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:41.940
to deliver this program the game publishers unite together to work

01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.340
through issues around

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:48.340
issues such as waiving royalties packaging costs etc. in order to maximize

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.140
charitable contribution last year Sony

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:53.940
delivered a bundle for the ESA and this year Microsoft has agreed to create a

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:55.900
three-game bundle to sell a retail

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.660
with the proceeds going to the ESA charity so

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:03.580
awesome then you'll probably see that in stores on the 23rd

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.900
alright well

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:10.540
I guess that's it for the show unfortunately our stream never came back

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:11.500
up so

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:14.740
if one of you that's still in chat DarkSakura I don't know just let them know unfortunately

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.760
we've wrapped the show

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.900
and unfortunately I'll just have to come back next week or download the show on Tuesday

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.420
but we thank them for sticking out

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:23.100
any of those folks that were still around hoping we'd come back up but

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.300
unfortunately the

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:27.220
computer screwed up and now I have this dialogue box on my screen that will not

01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:28.420
go away this is just

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:33.620
oh my god somebody put a gun in this computer it's done

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:38.660
alright so we're gonna go ahead and go around and get everybody's final thoughts and

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:43.380
wrap up tonight's broken show. It doesn't seem like the first show after a major landmark

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:46.140
show is always like really broken like I seem to remember 201 was really screwed

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.940
there's the craptacular artwork for it

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.540
too bad Fusion Frenzy 2 is shit

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:56.020
too bad all those games are shit

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:59.420
alright anyhow let's go around and get everybody's final thought Chris thank you

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.740
very much for being here even if now you think you're some type of bad luck charm

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:05.860
but I don't care we still love having you here and come back

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:09.060
dammit I am and I didn't tell you I'm going to Disneyland next week

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:13.180
so I'll be thinking of you. Whore. No. Get lots of pictures on the teacups

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:18.940
I will. Me and Xtaphir are going. Aww that would be fun. He hasn't been in a long long time so I'm

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:21.820
gonna make him go on that ferris wheel that sways back and forth he's gonna cry

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:25.620
it'll be fun. Yeah I won't go on that but yeah I'm you're probably gonna see a lot

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:25.980
more

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:29.340
me until until March because I'm gonna be moving out there

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:32.860
and hopefully you'll be able to hear me on my podcast

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:37.220
Oh! Which just goes to further prove

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:41.300
everybody has a freaking podcast. Exactly. We were first god dammit

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:45.740
Alright thank you very much for being here. You're welcome. Puppy thanks for coming back

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:48.980
and I'm glad you got to talk more this week even if

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:53.340
sorta even though there was like like only two microphones but you know what

01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:54.220
can you do? More chaos.

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:57.700
It's like your shirt says, Booched. Yes. The show is Booched

01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:02.660
Is that a Puzzle Pirates thing? Yes it is a Puzzle Pirates thing. Wow what does Booched mean?

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:07.140
You screwed up? Yeah that's basically what it means. This is like the worst rating you get on a

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:07.860
puzzle if you

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:13.180
Oh okay well that was a very appropriate shirt to wear to the show

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:16.900
I have to see there was another article I was reading on

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:20.180
Destructoid that they had is this game called

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:24.180
Animal Kaiser and it's basically where you can pit different animals against each other

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:27.260
in like deathmatch in the arcade so they have

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.540
snake versus Black Panther and Indian Cobra

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:34.580
and it's awesome because you can just pick all sorts of different animals to fight each

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:34.980
other

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:38.380
I swear to God just pick a black mumble you'll want every time

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:42.540
I swear to God there's like an entire video game craze that is just dead set

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:43.980
on pissing Peeta off

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:48.220
And as far as I'm concerned, have at em. Peeta can kiss my ass

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:51.820
Hey Peeta came back with Super Chick Sisters or whatever that was it was

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:52.900
actually kinda cute

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:55.900
I gotta say all things but that was again I'm

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.220
I'm visiting

01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:00.900
Oh my god. Now what?

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:05.220
Loki, this will double as your final thought

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:09.500
They have a shark versus a lion

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:13.500
That's the coolest shit I've ever seen

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:18.260
I gotta see this here. They've got to have this in the United States

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.140
I know this is one of those quirky, okay

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:24.700
We need to see

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:31.220
Sorry I gotta...

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:34.340
This is on YouTube? Animal Kaiser

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:38.060
There's a shark and a freaking lion

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:42.180
The lion and the shark is out of water

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:45.380
and it's kicking the lion's ass. How is that possible?

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:50.220
The fucking shark won! If this is why Smash Brothers got delayed then I'm okay with it

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:54.820
Seriously, the new third-party characters being announced

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:59.020
Shark and lion

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:03.860
DarkSakura, your final thought. First of all, everyone's still PMing me

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:07.180
on a chat

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:10.500
My final thought is

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:14.980
bitches. Alright. They're referring to work

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:18.340
And my final thought is sorry the show is broken tonight

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:22.420
and you get what you pay for. But thank you anyway. Thank you. What?

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:26.660
What do you mean I'm doing it wrong?

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:30.220
Can we just stop the show now?

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:34.060
Thank you very much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.620
independent radio even when it's as screwed up as this

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:39.860
If you like what you hear since we do this for free

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:43.580
tell friends about the program, tell enemies about the program. Leave us a five

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:44.860
star review on iTunes

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:47.940
Post us in your signature, I don't know, whatever. Just spread the word

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:51.860
We need it. Thank you guys very much. We'll see you next week and hopefully

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:55.540
things will be in working order and not booched

01:14:55.540 --> 01:15:24.780
Have a good week.

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.620
you
