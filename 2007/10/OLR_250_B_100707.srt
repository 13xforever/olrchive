Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,100
We are live here on this Sunday evening, October the 7th, 2007,

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,100
for part B of our 250th weekly episode.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,600
That's 250 weeks in a row, give or take a few.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,600
It's applause.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,600
We're testing out our new applause light tonight, everybody. It's great.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,100
It just means that we've had nothing to do on a Sunday night now for how long?

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,100
I know.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,600
I think we've gotten emails about this before, like,

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,600
how do you guys manage to motivate yourselves to do it every week?

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,600
And we just kind of go, well, we just do it, you know?

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
It's our club.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,600
Some people go to, you know, knitting clubs.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,100
Some people go to church.

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,100
Do or do not. There is no try.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,600
Some people go to poker. We do a radio show on the internet.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Some people go to bingo.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Some people go to a bar and get pissed, by the way.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
Anyhow, back to the news.

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
So bungee. Bungee bungee bungee bungee.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Some people play Halo religiously every Sunday night.

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
I like the word bungee and I like saying it repeatedly.

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
It's like balls.

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Just one of those words that makes you laugh.

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Well.

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Anyway, bungee has decided to be independent once again.

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
You know what this means?

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,600
This means we could very well get bungee games on a system that isn't an Xbox.

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,600
They could go back to Mac games.

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
Whoa.

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Halo for the iMac.

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
You know, actually, that would be kind of rad.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
And you know what? It would look better.

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
It would probably look better.

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Because what does graphics better, Mac or PC?

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
The Mac.

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Exactly.

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
That should be determined, actually.

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Not. No. No.

44
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
This battle is not happening tonight.

45
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,600
So Microsoft is going to continue keeping up with the Halo franchise.

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
And continue to partner with bungee on games.

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,600
However, we could have another rare on our hands.

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
So Killer Instinct 3 by bungee?

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Ooh.

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
I guess that wouldn't really happen, would it?

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Dude, I would love another Killer Instinct. Wouldn't that be great?

52
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,600
That's a whole other company's issues, though.

53
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
That's a whole other box of ex-lax.

54
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
I want to say I heard that there's some part of the deal, though,

55
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
where Microsoft gets first look at the games bungee puts out.

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600
So it's kind of like, well, we're setting you free, okay?

57
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
So we're letting the hoe leave the bedroom.

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,600
But she's still got to turn tricks for me whenever I want, basically, is what it is.

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
It's like the pimp and his hoe.

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Kind of, yeah. That's what I'm saying.

61
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
So the hoe's still got to put out when I need it, right?

62
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Yeah.

63
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,600
So, yeah.

64
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I mean, then that makes me think, what in their right mind is Microsoft going to pass on?

65
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Because bungee makes a lot, a lot of hits.

66
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,600
You know, I think the only way they're going to pass is if bungee says,

67
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
hey, we want to make a game starring Mario,

68
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,600
or we want to make a game starring, what's a Sony franchise, Ratchet and Clank?

69
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Spyro?

70
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Spyro, yes. We won't make a Spyro game.

71
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Well, that's not a Sony franchise anymore.

72
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Banjo-Kazooie?

73
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
No, anyhow.

74
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
No, that was Nintendo.

75
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,600
That was Nintendo.

76
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Smash Bandicoot.

77
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Sweet Tooth.

78
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
There you go.

79
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Sweet Tooth.

80
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Darkknight in chat.

81
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Chat.orangemanstrated.com says, Marathon. K, thanks.

82
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
And GS191 says, I think it's time to revisit the Marathon series.

83
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Rama says, and Halo was originally developed for the PC before Microsoft bought them.

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Hmm.

85
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
All right.

86
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Your comments in chat.

87
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Chat.orangemanstrated.com, when we tape live every Sunday night.

88
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Anyways, so as we've been talking for the past few weeks now,

89
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,600
there's this new SKU that people keep talking about, the Xbox 360 Arcade console.

90
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Well, it's been listed on a few retail sites now.

91
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Toys R Us being one of them.

92
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Another one being Amazon.com.

93
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Both having it showing as being released on the 23rd.

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,600
But, of course, I'm sure that means that it's not coming out, right?

95
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Because it must be fake.

96
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,600
A rumor and stuff, since all this information has been constantly leaking out about it.

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,600
For those who may not remember, it's basically the replacement for the core system.

98
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,600
It will come with an HDMI port, a wireless controller, a 256 megabyte memory unit,

99
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,600
and five Xbox Live Arcade games on a single disk,

100
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,600
including Booboo, Rocket, Pac-Man, Uno, Feeding Frenzy, and Luxor 2.

101
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,600
All for the same price as the current core system, which is $279.99 in the U.S.

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Uh...

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Yeah, you will not be surprised to see this come out.

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Yeah, this story just goes to prove that rumors about Microsoft are always true.

105
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,600
I mean, right? Because this rumor about the arcade thing has been going around forever.

106
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Forever, and they have screenshots taken from the website.

107
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Yeah.

108
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
That's what I was saying with the Namco.

109
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,600
It's like, oh, let's take five games that are each a megabyte and put it on a DVD.

110
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,600
It's like, ahh!

111
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Let's not bring up Namco in secrets. That's a sore subject for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

112
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Because all Namco rumors are true, too, but they don't want you to know that.

113
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Anyhow, because I'm sure that certain games aren't coming to a certain platform next week or anything.

114
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,600
They'll be rolling tether consoles soon, I'm sure.

115
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,600
Moving on. Pardon the man behind the curtain there. Pay no attention to him.

116
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Going back to Halo 3. That's right. Halo 3 is in the news, and we love Halo 3.

117
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,600
What's the hatred for Halo 3 over here, Casper?

118
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I don't hate Halo 3. It's just a boring generic space fighter game that I'm just indifferent about.

119
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Haha!

120
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Says Metroid.

121
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Yeah, but have you played the multiplayer game?

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
It's not generic, thank you, huh?

123
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
Oh, yeah.

124
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Oh, God. Are we going to get into the Halo 3?

125
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Yeah, that's why 73% of people voted for Samus.

126
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Well, I just want to say this. On the Japanese software charts this week, Halo 3 actually managed to top the charts in Japan.

127
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Now, keep in mind, though, that if you separate two of the Pokemon games and these Pokemon games,

128
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,600
if you separate the two Pokemon games, then Halo 3 was number one.

129
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,600
But this is just kind of a nyah nyah nyah for people who said that Halo would not do well in Japan,

130
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
and the Japanese hate Halo, and blah blah blah.

131
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
I would like to actually say, because I really suck at Halo,

132
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,600
I got my ass kicked by a Japanese player the other day on Halo, and it made me feel, well,

133
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,600
I mean, every time I play Halo, I feel inadequate, to be honest.

134
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
But you do have the power of the donut armor.

135
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,600
Yes, I have the pink armor, so that's always awesome.

136
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,600
And I had to show Rob donut in red versus blue last night.

137
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Halo 3 moved 59,000 copies, but it should be said, Pokemon's mysterious dungeon Toki moved 55,000 copies,

138
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,600
but there's another version called Yami which moved 46,000 copies, but they're counted separately.

139
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
So, there you have it.

140
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
By the way, PlayStation 3 is in the top ten.

141
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Elder Scrolls Oblivion is number nine on the Japanese charts.

142
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,600
I think that's also newsworthy as well, to point out that that Japanese translation is doing pretty well,

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,600
when it's a very, quote unquote, American RPG.

144
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Doing pretty well in Japan.

145
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
But it's an RPG.

146
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Yeah, it is. So, good times.

147
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Well, something that is going to be coming out in the UK on the 9th of November is Gears of War PC,

148
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,600
which we all know was an Xbox 360 title.

149
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:33,600
There are five new single player parts of the game, new campaigns.

150
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Or, I'm sorry, there are new places to explore in the main campaign,

151
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:46,600
and there's also an encounter with the, what's it called, Bromack, that's from the end of Act 1 in the 360 version.

152
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
I guess it's this big dinosaur.

153
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
I'd never played it.

154
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
It's a big creature thing.

155
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,600
They had it, like, in the trailers and stuff.

156
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
Okay.

157
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:02,600
Well, they've also, of course, expanded the multiplayer options.

158
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
They have a bunch of new maps.

159
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,600
There's also, they've improved graphic quality and resolution,

160
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:16,600
so that if your machine is beefy enough, it'll make it look sweet.

161
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,600
They don't have, though, the four player co-op.

162
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,600
I'd like to ask a question and start a little fight here in the chat room and in the studio,

163
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,600
because this is always fun, a little bit of controversy, speaking of Gears of War.

164
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Since both these games came out this year, which game do you think is better overall?

165
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Start with Loki. Gears of War or Halo 3?

166
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
And why?

167
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I would say Halo 3 just because it's a lot more fun of a game.

168
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Gears of War was really fucking hard, especially if you don't play first person shooters a lot.

169
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,600
You probably wouldn't like the multiplayer in it.

170
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
And the multiplayer is kind of, I don't know, I didn't like the multiplayer for Gears of War.

171
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I didn't play it that much either, though, so I can't really judge it too much.

172
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Halo is fun. Now, if you're into just straight graphics, then Gears of War fucking kicks the crap out of Halo 3.

173
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,600
And also, too, you know, a bit of semantics here.

174
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Gears of War came out last year.

175
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Oh, did it? I thought it was like November last year.

176
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Oh, damn it. Never mind.

177
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Well, then wait, but they're still out within a year of each other, so the question still works.

178
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
So there you go.

179
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Well, how about this?

180
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,600
If you were a completely new player sitting down and you played through Gears of War and you played through Halo, what would be your opinion? How's that?

181
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,600
My thing is I love co-op mode in both of the games.

182
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
I think they both have a stellar co-op mode, and more games should have co-op mode in them because it makes the game fun.

183
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Quit falling asleep over there, Eddie.

184
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,600
But as far as I just didn't like the cover system in Gears of War, so Halo 3 is more of the game for me personally.

185
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
I didn't like the cover thing.

186
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Say what you will.

187
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
That's that.

188
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Alright, I'm sorry, we're putting the Nintendo fanboy to sleep, so we better move on with some news.

189
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
So sorry to inconvenience you.

190
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,600
Maybe we'll just get some completely random news, Loki, to wake Eddie up over there.

191
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Well, something very inconceivable has happened, and they have decided to make a Princess Bride game,

192
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:19,600
which is going to be releasing a demo version of it to coincide with the 20th anniversary DVD of it,

193
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,600
and it will be the True Love and High Adventure, the official Princess Bride game.

194
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Only one little problem, though, is that it is going to be a casual game, at least by the sounds of it so far.

195
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Wouldn't it be more appropriate to call this game Wuv Twi-Wuv?

196
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Mallage.

197
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,600
But it is going to be a PC game, and it's going to be probably a downloadable title.

198
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Is it like point and click?

199
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
No idea.

200
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,600
Oh, I was just asking if it was like point and click, or what's the interface style?

201
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Nope, no one knows yet.

202
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:07,600
It's being put out by, let's see here, well they said World Wide Biggies, which I've never heard of them.

203
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
So Rob's choking?

204
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
We're not going to go there.

205
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:22,600
No, honestly, I've never heard of World Wide Biggies, which can be found at www.biggies.com.

206
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I don't know. I'm not familiar with any of their games, so I can't see if it's going to be good.

207
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Alright, well, you know, sleep all you want through the Halo and the Gears of War news, Eddie, but you've got to admit this is good.

208
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
This is Halo being used for a good cause.

209
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
This is a group called the Cave Girls who put this together.

210
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
No, seriously, it's like a gaming group called the Cave Girls who put this together.

211
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,600
It's a tournament called the Fight Like a Girl Halo tournament, and it's being held this year on October 20th, and it's on Xbox Live.

212
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,600
It's a $10 entry fee. Anybody can sign up and it takes place.

213
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
All the proceeds go towards the fight against breast cancer.

214
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,600
So the tournament is being used to raise money for breast cancer awareness, which is pretty awesome.

215
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
There's two different tournaments they're having.

216
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,600
There's a single elimination and double team, two versus two.

217
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,600
And if you want to check out their forums at CaveGirlForums.com, they really go down the list of everything that it is,

218
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
and you can actually donate your entry fee there online.

219
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Pretty neat there.

220
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Very creative idea for a good cause.

221
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
I would hope that maybe Microsoft, this will get on their radar.

222
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Maybe it'll be a blip on their radar.

223
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Maybe they'll advertise it on the site or something.

224
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Is it Cave Girls with a G?

225
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
No, it's just like a cave G-I-R-L.

226
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Like a no riot girl G-R-R thing going on there or whatever.

227
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Girl.

228
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
So there you have it.

229
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Girl.

230
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Well, the resident O-L-R Cave Girl is going to open up the mailbag right now.

231
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,600
And you notice how she responded with a very cave girl.

232
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Hey, don't make me get out of this club and beat you.

233
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,600
When you send in your e-mails every week to Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, our very own dark Sakura.

234
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Even if she is a cave girl, we still love her.

235
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,600
She reads the e-mails and we respond to them.

236
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
So open up the mailbag and let's see what's there.

237
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

238
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Our Tetsuya says Rob's going to get clubbed.

239
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
First up, your mom.

240
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
Last night.

241
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
Ooh.

242
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Ooh.

243
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Anyway, we have an e-mail from Picaruno.

244
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Is that how it's pronounced?

245
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I believe so.

246
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
Hi all.

247
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Hi.

248
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Who's all?

249
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
I'm writing in to tell you about something I verified this week.

250
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,600
So you know that Sony opened the PC version of the PlayStation Store in Japan only for now, right?

251
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Well, there's something decidedly dodgy about how they check to see if you're allowed to access it.

252
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,600
When I tried to access the store, I managed to see the front page in usage FAQs.

253
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,600
But since I tried to click on a game, I got an English message saying PlayStation Store is not available in the selected country or region.

254
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
This is rather odd seeing as, you know, I live in Japan.

255
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,600
So I took a screenshot showing the error message along with an IP geolocation result.

256
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
It's on Flickr.

257
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Now you might be thinking that since I was using a Mac, the error message was a badly worded way of saying use Windows, fool.

258
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
But no, even on Windows, I get the exact same error.

259
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Then Sakurina suggested I try changing my system's language settings to Japanese.

260
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Lo and behold, it now works.

261
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,600
There are several reasons why this is retarded.

262
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,600
First, regional settings on a machine should make no difference to a website.

263
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:49,600
And also to point out something, when the Sarah Jane Avengers was first coming out and they had all the clips up and everything on the BBC's website,

264
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,600
they actually had it blocked by IP, not by your language.

265
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,600
This is what Sony should have done so that you couldn't see the website outside of the UK.

266
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,600
But anyway, second is borderline racist as it implies.

267
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Anyone who doesn't have their computer set to Japanese, i.e. native Japanese people, shouldn't have access to the site.

268
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Seriously, I'm a registered resident of Japan and I have a legal right to access the store.

269
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,600
It's ridiculous that I'm barred because I have my computer set in a language I'm more comfortable with.

270
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Does this mean that any native Japanese person can access the Japan store from wherever they are in the world just because of their computer's language settings?

271
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
How dare you, Sony.

272
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,600
You know what I would love for you to do is change your settings to Japanese.

273
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,600
And I don't think you should be able to do this given where you live, but I would love to have somebody else anywhere else in the country,

274
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,600
anywhere else in the world, set their language settings to Japanese and try to order to ship outside of Japan.

275
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,600
I was going to ask, if that's all you have to do, then me living in the US, could I just change my language to Japanese and do it?

276
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,600
The only other thing I think of, and this is because I've ordered stuff through Japanese websites,

277
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:04,600
is that they actually, the way that the postal system works there, it has it all set by your postal code.

278
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,600
And it's set by your postal code, what city you live in, and what section of the city you live in.

279
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:17,600
It's really, really difficult because it's set so completely different than the US system that you're not going to really be able to...

280
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,600
If the fields are preloaded that way, then you're not going to be able to do it.

281
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Huh. Well, good luck on your quest, Picaruno.

282
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Seriously.

283
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,600
So, next email up is...

284
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:39,600
You mentioned the orange box in the last episode, and it just occurred to me that I should send you guys my anti-orange box rant from a couple weeks ago.

285
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Okay?

286
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600
The rant. Valve and the orange box. Valve, you suck.

287
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
That shall be the thesis of this rant.

288
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Wow, this is a rant with a college education.

289
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,600
I log in to Steam a few days ago, and I see pre-order Half-Life 2, Episode 2.

290
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Now, I'm pumped. I love Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2, Episode 1.

291
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
So, I click to pre-order, and I see this.

292
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Pre-order the orange box. The orange box contains Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2, Episode 1, Half-Life 2, Episode 2, Team Fortress 2, and Portal.

293
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,600
So, instead of the $20 that was advertised when Valve first announced the ship date for Half-Life 2, Episode 2, TF2, and Portal,

294
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,600
they added two games I already own and love into the package, cranked the price up to $50, and forced me to buy them.

295
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Again.

296
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
I'm not pleased by this.

297
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Now, I wouldn't mind this normally, but this is the one way Valve has announced they're selling Half-Life 2, Episode 2.

298
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Why is that?

299
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,600
This is the point where some of you might say that they did this with Half-Life 2's release.

300
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Now, I know I have a special edition DVD.

301
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,600
The difference is Half-Life 2 completely upgraded the graphics system for its packaged older games,

302
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,600
Half-Life and Counter-Strike, now known as Counter-Strike Source and Half-Life Source.

303
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Ugh.

304
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Now, some of the smart people may be like, wow, a company like Valve couldn't have screwed up their release this much.

305
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Oh, they think they didn't, but they have a solution.

306
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Gifting.

307
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,600
It turns out that if I buy the orange box, I can give away Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2, Episode 1 to people.

308
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
What happens to them if they want to buy Half-Life 2, Episode 2?

309
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,600
Are they going to release it so that you can buy Episode 2 alone, or are they going to do it launch day, or are they going to make us wait?

310
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,600
At one point, they were going to have the black box, which didn't have Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, but that was axed.

311
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Ugh.

312
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Okay.

313
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,600
I'll probably break down and dish out the extra cash, because I absolutely adore the series, and must know what happens next,

314
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,600
so if anyone wants a free copy of Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, I will probably post a follow-up regarding if I break down or not.

315
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Either way, Valve has gone out of their way to piss off the core audience in hopes of increasing their gamership.

316
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Well done, Valve. Well done.

317
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
And that is from...

318
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
There's still tons of people excited about this coming out, though.

319
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
That's from Super Al.

320
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,600
But that is, you know, nobody ever enjoys those type of bait-and-switch things, where it's like, you know,

321
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
hey, you can get it for this low price, but oh, never mind, we don't want to do that anymore,

322
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,600
because we thought of a way to make more money out of it.

323
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
That's just capitalism at its finest.

324
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Oh, hell yeah.

325
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,600
So, the last email, because we didn't get very many.

326
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Greetings, OLR peoples!

327
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Greetings!

328
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Ow, my neck hurts.

329
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,600
This is from Pooface, by the way.

330
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
I love that name.

331
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Hi, Pooface!

332
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,600
On last week's show, you were talking about the asshole Mario levels on YouTube.

333
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Well, there is a download of a file you can use to patch Super Mario World ROM

334
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,600
and turn it into the Kaizo Mario World Game, a.k.a. Asshole Mario.

335
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I downloaded it and played it.

336
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,600
I was trying for nearly an hour on just the first part where you have to jump the Bullet Bills across the enormous jump.

337
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,600
I still haven't gotten it, and I have no clue how many vulgarities I yelled at while trying to attempt this mass torture device.

338
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Download it and give it a try if you're feeling brave.

339
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Okay, I don't even need to download Asshole Mario,

340
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,600
because you know what I did download this week on Virtual Console is Super Mario Bros. 2, the Japanese version.

341
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Which is almost asshole.

342
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Okay, that's a pretty asshole Mario right there.

343
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,600
I was shouting obscenities, and I barely got to World 1-2, and I kept dying and having to continue.

344
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
I mean, that game is hard.

345
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
But the sad part is... I'm not dumb.

346
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Don't say that. You hurt my feelings.

347
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,600
We got another email in, however I'm not going to read it because it was fairly rude.

348
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Save it for next week.

349
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
About one of our listeners.

350
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Save it for next week.

351
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
I'm not going to read it at all.

352
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Real quick though, I want to say that the sad part about it is I remember playing this game

353
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,600
back when it was a part of Mario All-Stars on the Super Nintendo, and I totally beat it.

354
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,600
No problem. It took me like a day to beat it. No problem.

355
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,600
And now it's like my video game skills have deteriorated with age, and that just makes me sad.

356
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Okay, you're getting old, Rob.

357
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
So which is harder, Rob?

358
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Maybe some asper cream to combat the arthritis.

359
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Shut up.

360
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Which is harder, that or the first level of Kid Icarus?

361
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,600
Actually, seeing as I got to World 2 and Kid Icarus eventually, it's probably that.

362
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Terror, danger, horror.

363
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,600
I didn't even know there was a second level to Kid Icarus.

364
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Kid Icarus, I only know the first level song, and it's like, wait a minute, did you beat the game?

365
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,600
What about you, smartass? Did you ever get to World 2?

366
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
I never played Kid Icarus.

367
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
You suck.

368
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
So no, I didn't.

369
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
I've beaten Kid Icarus.

370
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Me too, when I was seven.

371
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
I beat Rygar.

372
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Or no, I haven't been older than that.

373
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Rygar is a great game.

374
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Rygar is great except for the ending.

375
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Now, if you beat Rygar, that's hardcore, because you could not save or password that game.

376
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
I know, that shit was hard.

377
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
You have to leave the Nintendo on overnight.

378
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Oh, we did too.

379
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,600
And you know what else though, Bionic Commando with Hitler's brain blowing up.

380
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
That was great.

381
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
I never beat that game.

382
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
That game was so frickin' hard.

383
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
You know what game was frickin' hard?

384
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
It was Strider on the NES.

385
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
It was based off of the Japanese comics.

386
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
We need to pay tribute to video game endings at some point.

387
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Yes, we do.

388
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Good ones.

389
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Not ones that are like, the end user game.

390
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,600
There actually was a funny YouTube clip, I want to say it showed up on Digg this week,

391
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
about really bad video game endings.

392
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
And it just was a bunch of bad video game endings back to back.

393
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
It was kind of funny.

394
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,600
I hate the ones where it's like, you can only get the good ending if you play in hard mode.

395
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
You know, I'm thinking, ah!

396
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Wimp.

397
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
I am playing hard mode.

398
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Wimp.

399
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,600
All right, well if you would like Dark Soccer to read your emails on air, send your emails

400
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
to mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

401
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Just keep it clean, and don't make them mean.

402
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
We don't like mean emails.

403
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,600
I don't want emails bad mouthing other listeners, so just drop it.

404
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Unless you want to badmouth Loki.

405
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
Yeah, you can, you can.

406
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Or Rice Princess.

407
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Hey, shut up.

408
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
We need some good Rice Princess bashing emails.

409
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Hey, no.

410
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
And Eddie bashing emails.

411
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Eddie's fine, but not me.

412
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
All right.

413
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
Let's move on to some gaming news.

414
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,800
Anyways, it started out as an April Fool's joke from ThinkGeek, but now, due to popular

415
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,280
demand, they have gone ahead and made it.

416
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
It is the 8-bit tie.

417
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,800
It's a tie that looks like it's made out of pixels, and you can buy it for yourself for

418
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,640
the low, low price of $19.99.

419
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,960
It's available on their online store, and I guess it's gonna...

420
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,880
It's a way to get you some extra nerd cred, and it's a clip-on, by the way.

421
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,760
So 8-bit tie, that's kind of nifty.

422
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,320
All right.

423
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,360
I think it looks kind of cool.

424
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,000
I tried.

425
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,920
I think it would be funny to wear it to work one day, just randomly, and have people stare

426
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,520
at me going, what is wrong with you, because they don't already do that.

427
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,480
Oh, did you guys see it in the studio there?

428
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Now, what do you think?

429
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,800
Would you wear that out in public?

430
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,960
Would you wear that to the bank?

431
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,880
Not to the bank, but yeah, I would actually probably wear that.

432
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,880
Because you're a nerd.

433
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,040
All right.

434
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,520
Well, something else that is not to be seen in public is new levels from the new Simpsons

435
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
game.

436
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,460
That is, if you're Rockstar, because Rockstar has their panties in a bunch because they're

437
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,720
upset that the Simpsons game dares to make fun of Grand Theft Auto with its own little

438
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,840
Grand Theft Scratchy game thing going on.

439
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,720
Apparently, some of the game's content had to be pulled because Rockstar was not happy

440
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,240
with the way the license was being used.

441
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,560
Now, to be fair, Rockstar is not the only one, apparently, but Rockstar is the only

442
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,560
one that's being called out by name.

443
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,680
So apparently, at Leipzig, there was actually a poster at the games convention in Germany,

444
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
right?

445
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,760
There was a poster with Grand Theft Scratchy that caught Rockstar's eye, and they asked

446
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
for it to be removed.

447
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,320
Now, on the other hand, Harmonix, they thought Satar Hero was funny.

448
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,940
So that is being left in the game, apparently.

449
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,280
So apparently, some companies don't love it.

450
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,200
Some people have a sense of humor, some do not.

451
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Probably it's without poo.

452
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
I have no idea.

453
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
I know somebody who has an electric sitar.

454
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:43,320
But here's the thing is that I have this feeling, to Rockstar's credit, I have this feeling

455
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,600
that it's just one suit who has their feathers ruffled over this.

456
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,480
There's just one person whose words have been misconstrued to person versus person.

457
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,800
Because I bet most people at Rockstar have a sense of humor.

458
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:58,800
And it's sad that one person probably has made this whole thing get blown out of proportion.

459
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,640
But that's what happens when you're an executive and you say something silly.

460
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,100
Well the thing, I think that their thing behind it is that it's kind of, I mean, they're making

461
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,200
it so that it's very obvious that it's a parody of Grand Theft Auto.

462
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,240
I mean, Grand Theft's scratchy, they're not doing it like, you know, was it the game that

463
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,800
was in the actual Simpsons show, which I don't remember was, like, Grand Theft Auto or something.

464
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,880
You know, I don't remember where they called it, like, Death Hunter or something out, whatever.

465
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,120
But either way, you know, the fact that it's so similar is why they're probably pissed

466
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
off.

467
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,600
I mean, if it was a game that you knew was kind of like Grand Theft Auto but didn't actually

468
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,880
sound like Grand Theft Auto, they might not be so mad.

469
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,160
Yeah, but is it really going to cut into their profits?

470
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,440
No, it's not.

471
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,400
They're just weighing little pussies, but, you know, that's still...

472
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,840
Well, thank you for translating.

473
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,840
I appreciate that.

474
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,220
All right.

475
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,560
One more story before we get into tonight's episode of Match Game, which we promised for

476
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,840
this part of Part B. One more story.

477
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
One more story.

478
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
Hold your applause.

479
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
We're not into match games just yet.

480
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
We have one more story.

481
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,400
We do, don't we?

482
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Mm-hmm.

483
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Ooh.

484
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
We do.

485
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,920
Well, more joy for our European buddies is that Call of Duty 4 is going to have a special

486
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
edition.

487
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,920
You know, there was the beta test and all that went on.

488
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:22,040
So what's going to come with the special edition is two and a half hours of SCS footage with

489
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,640
the elite soldiers' history and their formation in the Second World War up to modern day conflicts,

490
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,520
a making of documentary, a level walkthrough by Infinity Ward, and a hardcover art book

491
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,520
with lots of the concept pictures.

492
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,920
And anyone playing on the PC has to download their strategy guide.

493
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,920
And that will also be available in the United States.

494
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,360
Cool.

495
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,080
Worldwide loving for Call of Duty fans.

496
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,520
But only on the Xbox 360.

497
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
All right.

498
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,480
Since it is episode number 250, we're going to play one of our very favorite games, the

499
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Match Game.

500
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,480
But in order to play the Match Game, we need to get some contestants.

501
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,160
So we're going to take, if you would like to play the Match Game, if you're in our chat

502
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,240
room, just type me.

503
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Only once.

504
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,840
If you type me more than once, you're not going to get picked.

505
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,520
But if you type me once, then we're going to let Puppy pick our contestant from chat

506
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,640
today because he hasn't really talked a lot in tonight's episode.

507
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
I know.

508
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
There's not enough microphones at once.

509
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
I know.

510
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,980
Sadly, our fourth microphone died, so we only have three microphones we're sharing.

511
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,080
So Puppy will pick the chat contestant soon.

512
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,360
But we also want to get somebody on the telephone.

513
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,920
So if you would like to give us a call and be our person on the phone to play, give us

514
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
a call right now.

515
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:38,880
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio or our telephone number 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

516
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,000
We're going to wait for somebody to call.

517
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,600
There's a little bit of a delay between when we say something and when people hear it.

518
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,480
Just now seeing all the me's jumping up the street.

519
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
Yes, meanwhile.

520
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Okay, so Puppy sees all the me's.

521
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,960
So why don't you pick somebody who said me only once that gets to play Match Game tonight.

522
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
I'm going to roll.

523
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
I'm just going to be nerdy.

524
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,280
You're going to roll a D20?

525
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
I did, actually.

526
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
Oh my lord.

527
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Wait, hold on.

528
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Hold on.

529
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
We're getting a chatter.

530
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Hold on.

531
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
Hi.

532
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

533
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Who's this?

534
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Hello.

535
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
You're on.

536
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
Hi, Footy Monster.

537
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Hi, Footy Monster.

538
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,480
How are you?

539
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Is there a bad delay tonight?

540
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Oh, it's probably...

541
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
I'm fine.

542
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
How are you guys doing?

543
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Good.

544
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,840
It's probably the Operator 11 webcam causing us a little bit of a delay tonight.

545
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,480
So I have a feeling we might have to kill Op 11 in order to have a little lag.

546
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
I'm sorry, Operator 11.

547
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,800
We're going to have to say bye-bye to you guys to kill the lag.

548
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
But we'll see you next week.

549
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,400
We're going to be here on Operator 11 with more OrangeLoungeRadio.

550
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,680
Should we try calling back?

551
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
No, that's okay.

552
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,120
I'm pretty sure it's the lag is being caused from Operator 11, so we're just going to end

553
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
the feed there.

554
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I can hear, but...

555
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Ah.

556
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
Don't...

557
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Why are you staring at that?

558
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Meh.

559
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
All right.

560
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Hopefully that'll help a little better.

561
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,880
Can you hear us now, Footy Monster?

562
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
I can hear you.

563
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
I don't know if...

564
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
All right.

565
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
There might just be a little bit of a delay.

566
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
That's okay.

567
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
We'll deal with it.

568
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
All right.

569
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Puppy, who's playing from chat room?

570
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,880
My random roll of a die has picked escapists.

571
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Escapists.

572
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,620
Oh, great, because escapists did the thing about the show tunes earlier, so I'm really

573
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,960
excited to see what escapists is going to do during match games.

574
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,120
So I'll send a message.

575
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,720
You win.

576
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,040
Stand by.

577
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,120
All right.

578
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,440
Do you know how the match game works, Footy Monster?

579
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,520
I believe so.

580
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,040
You say something, then blank, and have to figure out what that's supposed to be, right?

581
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Yes.

582
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,240
We're going to say something with a blank, and you have to figure out what that something

583
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
is.

584
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,080
So I just want to make sure you can hear us okay, right?

585
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
I can hear you okay.

586
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
I think this is the grape.

587
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,080
I can hear you okay.

588
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,080
Okay.

589
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,080
Well, that's all right.

590
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Now I see escapists has left chat, so I hope that's not a bad sign.

591
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
Let's see.

592
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,080
I want to make sure he's still there.

593
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,720
Are you going to play?

594
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,480
You left chat.

595
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
That's never happened before.

596
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
We have a player just leave.

597
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Oh, shit.

598
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
I got picked.

599
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
Bye.

600
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
I'm bailing.

601
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
I scared him off.

602
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Leaving.

603
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
See ya.

604
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
Oh, wait.

605
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
I got a prime message back.

606
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Whoops.

607
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Yep.

608
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
I'll still be there.

609
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Okay.

610
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Good.

611
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
All right.

612
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
What's over here?

613
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
It is tonight.

614
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Footy monster versus escapists.

615
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
But before we get to it, we need to get some theme music and introduce our celebrities

616
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
tonight.

617
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,240
All right.

618
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,200
Celebrity number one tonight is the queen of the show who does not put up with shit

619
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
from anybody.

620
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,640
It is dark Sakura.

621
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
Hi.

622
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,720
All right.

623
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,920
Celebrity number two tonight is the king of the show.

624
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
It's me.

625
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
No, I'm kidding.

626
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Loki is here.

627
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
Say hello to Loki.

628
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
I'm here.

629
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,200
And celebrity number three is the other king of the show.

630
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
I don't know.

631
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Rob.

632
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
It's me.

633
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Hi.

634
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Hello.

635
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
How you doing?

636
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
All right.

637
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Also joining us tonight.

638
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
Say hello to puppy.

639
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Hello.

640
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Yes.

641
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
And puppy.

642
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Are you here to, are you here to plug anything puppy?

643
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,640
Because celebrities on game shows are usually here to plug something.

644
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,800
Normally I would plug baskin Robins, but I don't work for them anymore.

645
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
So I don't give a shit.

646
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
So go eat some Ben and Jerry's this week.

647
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Good idea.

648
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
There you go.

649
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Go get your cakes from cold stone.

650
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
All right.

651
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
Moving on.

652
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,960
Celebrity number five is rice princess.

653
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,360
Hello there.

654
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,360
Hello.

655
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,360
Hi.

656
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,460
And what are you here plugging tonight?

657
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,460
My friends.

658
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,460
You were about to say.

659
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,460
La la la la.

660
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,960
She's not like she's going to say her butt.

661
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Yes.

662
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:29,400
And as carousel in chat says the drag queen of the show that might've been about somebody

663
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
else.

664
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
I don't know.

665
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
There you have it.

666
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
All right.

667
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
And then also joining us.

668
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
Celebrity number six.

669
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
Hello.

670
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
Casper the gay.

671
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Yes.

672
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
How are you?

673
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Pretty good.

674
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Excellent.

675
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
And what are you here to plug tonight?

676
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
I will be playing your button.

677
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
All right.

678
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
Remember it's only porn.

679
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
If you tape it.

680
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
All right.

681
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,120
Now, Footy Monster, do you have anything to plug tonight?

682
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
I do.

683
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
What?

684
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
No, no, no.

685
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
You don't get to plug unless you win.

686
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
All right.

687
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Okay.

688
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
There you go.

689
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,120
All right.

690
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
So here we go.

691
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
All right.

692
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
So since we all know how it works, here it comes.

693
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
Question number one.

694
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
All right.

695
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,840
And Footy Monster, when you know your answer, just keep to yourself until the rest of us

696
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
have come up with our answer.

697
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Okay.

698
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
So here we go.

699
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
Do I have to exit the chat or anything?

700
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,840
No.

701
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
You don't have to.

702
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
You can use them for ideas.

703
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
It's okay.

704
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
It's not cheating.

705
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
All right.

706
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,840
So question number one.

707
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,280
Jamie was very excited to hear that Brewfest was going to be celebrated in World of Warcraft.

708
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:31,480
However, when she remembered that she canceled her account, she was sad.

709
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,640
But that's okay, she thought to herself.

710
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:41,840
If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can blank.

711
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,440
Jamie was very excited to hear that Brewfest was going to be celebrated in World of Warcraft

712
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,920
but she remembered she canceled her account.

713
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
That's okay.

714
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,600
If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can blank.

715
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Our celebrities will need to ding when they think of their answer.

716
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Ding.

717
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
Ding.

718
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Ding, I guess.

719
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
Bang.

720
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Bang.

721
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
All right.

722
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Puppy?

723
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
Ding.

724
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
All right.

725
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
Puppy's going to...

726
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
All right.

727
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Here we go.

728
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
All right.

729
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,080
And do you have an answer, Footy Monster?

730
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
I did, I think.

731
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,080
Have you thought of one?

732
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Yep.

733
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,760
We're having very bad connections to Argentina tonight.

734
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,080
Have you thought of an answer, Footy Monster?

735
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Yeah.

736
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,560
Can you hear me, guys?

737
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Yes, I can hear you.

738
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
All right.

739
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Here it is.

740
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
Footy Monster, fill in the blank.

741
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,480
If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can...

742
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,080
Dance nude with no armor in the middle of Ironforge.

743
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,680
Ah, dance nude with no armor in the middle of Ironforge.

744
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Very good answer.

745
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Very good answer.

746
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:50,240
The tape has said, gain 50 points and breathe through my mouth.

747
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,240
I'm sorry.

748
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,400
I guess I missed something here.

749
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
I don't know.

750
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,000
DarkSakura, what did you answer this?

751
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Let's see if there's a match.

752
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Not play World of Warcraft.

753
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,080
All right, fair enough.

754
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,080
Not a match, though.

755
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,080
Can I go next?

756
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
Sure.

757
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,080
Rice Princess.

758
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
Now, I can celebrate by...

759
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,800
Logging on to my Final Fantasy XI account.

760
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,040
Not a match, either.

761
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,840
Casper the Gay, what did you pick?

762
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,480
Go to the strip club, the Full Murloc.

763
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,480
You are an idiot.

764
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,480
That's terrible, Urha.

765
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,680
The Full Murloc.

766
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,240
That was the best part.

767
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
All right.

768
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,500
Loki, I know I can celebrate by...

769
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,440
Just drinking at home.

770
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
Just drinking at home.

771
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,800
How is that any different from any other night?

772
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,800
All right.

773
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,440
Good answer, but not a match.

774
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,320
You would have a celebratory hat.

775
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,720
Party hats, ooh.

776
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
All right.

777
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
Puppy.

778
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
That makes drinking more fun.

779
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,840
Puppy, I'm going to celebrate by...

780
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,400
Drinking by myself.

781
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,640
Drinking by myself.

782
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,300
Good answer, but not a match.

783
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:04,920
And lastly, my answer, she's going to participate by cosplaying in nothing but her Liederhosen,

784
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
which also was not a match.

785
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,080
Was that almost like a match with me, dancing dude kind of thing?

786
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
No.

787
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
All right.

788
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,360
Yours didn't involve Liederhosen.

789
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,760
Oh, escapist admits to being a shitty answer, okay?

790
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,020
Escapist meant to say, gain 50 pounds and breathe through my mouth, because that would

791
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,720
make her a better Warcraft player, get it?

792
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
To be...

793
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
Yeah.

794
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
But, but, but, but, but.

795
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
What?

796
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
I have a life.

797
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
Hey now, wait a minute.

798
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
I play Ragnarok.

799
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
I'm level 68.

800
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
At least you don't role play.

801
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
That's right.

802
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
I still would not have been a match.

803
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,600
But I did play on a role play server, however, I never partied with anyone.

804
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,560
We were wondering what the fuck escapist was smoking.

805
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,560
All right.

806
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,840
Glad to know everything's okay.

807
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
All right.

808
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,320
Ready for question number two, everybody?

809
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,040
All right, here we go.

810
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,200
Are you ready for question number two, footy monster?

811
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Definitely.

812
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,440
All right, bring on the pain.

813
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,700
Here we go.

814
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,360
Question number two.

815
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:03,760
Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release.

816
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,940
It's a game, people.

817
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,480
The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie.

818
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,020
When Loki came home from work one day wearing the tie, the wife exclaimed, what is that

819
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,440
around your neck?

820
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,480
It looks like a blank.

821
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,760
Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release.

822
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,180
The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie when Loki came home from work one

823
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,180
day wearing the tie.

824
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,540
The wife explained, what is that around your neck?

825
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,020
It looks like a blank.

826
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,020
You don't need to know about your ding on the show.

827
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,920
Sorry, I just saw the answer all right here. We go finally escapist gives an answer all right footy monster you ready here. We go

The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie when loki came home from work one day wearing the tie the wife exclaimed

Says footy monster keeps it very simple piece of shit all right

833
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:03,400
Let's uh let's go around and see what the folks in studio got dark soccer. What oh, I'm sorry whoops

00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
ding-a-ling ding-dong

00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,880
That's gonna be a tough one to match. Let's see though. You never know with this group all right dark soccer

837
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,320

Good answer. I think but not a match Casper the gay. It looks like a stripe of rice princesses titty juice

What the fuck

843
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,440
That doesn't make any sense what is wrong with you for real

844
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,440
I

845
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,920
Don't want to ask my boyfriend he

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Wow okay

850
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,880
But not a match and my answer says it looks like a fucking waste of our hard-earned money

851
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,680
There you go all right way to be realistic. Sorry well. That's what she would really say I mean honestly

852
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,800
All right

853
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
So here we go

854
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
I

855
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,720
Right are you ready for question number three are you gonna keep up your lead footy monster?

856
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:56,880
I'm gonna try all right, and it blow escapist out of the water tonight, but escapist you know try to catch up here we go

857
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,560
Just blow them out of the way I have to come I have to compliment everybody all right here

858
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,160
We go question number three and our last question tonight

859
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,640
Which thankfully has nothing to do with titty juice all right question number three?

860
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,840
Rob was happy to make amends with Nintendo when he called that poor rep back on Monday

861
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,600
They worked out their differences and the Nintendo rep said she would send out the Wii cases right away

862
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:30,540
However Rob was very surprised and shocked when inside the box from Nintendo there wasn't any Wii cases

863
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,120
But instead the rep sent him some blank. Oh

864
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,920
Do I ever think ding ding?

865
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Ding of the century

866
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,640
happy to make amends with Nintendo when he called that poor rep back on Monday. They

867
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,640
worked out their differences and the Nintendo rep said she would send out the Wii cases

868
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,120
right away. However, Rob was surprised when shots went inside the box from Nintendo. There

869
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,680
wasn't any Wii cases, but instead the rep sent him some blank.

870
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:19,400
Rob was very surprised and shocked when inside the box from Nintendo there wasn't any Wii

871
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:31,080
cases, but instead the rep sent him some steaming piles of crap and escapist said instead the

872
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:44,020
rep sent him some dried Yoshi crap. What the hell is wrong with our country tonight? And

873
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:52,240
Argentina? Alright, Dark Sakura, we'll start with you. Instead of the Wii cases, the rep

874
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:59,360
sent him some tube of lube. Good answer, not a match. Rice Princess, instead of the cases,

875
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:12,640
the rep sent him some tacked. Not a match. Eddie, the rep sent him some titty juice.

876
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,200
Yeah, I know that was coming. It was funny the first time. Oh, and Escapist will like

877
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,960
to remind us he's Canadian, so I'm sorry. What's wrong with three different countries

878
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:27,040
tonight apparently? Alright. Loki, Dooty! Dooty! Dooty, that's a match with Footy Monster.

879
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,000
Footy Monster gets another point. Good job, Footy Monster. Alright. Puppy, Nintendo rep

880
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:40,400
sent him some ribbed condoms. Ribbed condoms, not a match. Good answer though. And lastly,

881
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:48,560
my answer, the rep sent him a bowel movement. Someone had the nerve to send me a bowel movement

882
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,960
and they shall pay for this crime. Watch Pink Flamingo sometime. The couch has rejected

883
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,280
me. Alright, so there it is, another match for Footy Monster. Footy Monster. Argentina

884
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:08,640
beats Canada 3-0 tonight. Good job. Goal! That's okay, Escapist. We still love you.

885
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,040
We love Canada, but unfortunately you did not win tonight. Enjoy our lovely partying

886
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,680
gift. Our lovely partying gift tonight. Some of Rice Princess's love and affection. Love

887
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,040
and affection. What did you think I was going to say? Perfect. Alright. Footy Monster, you

888
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,640
win. You get to plug something. What did you want to plug? I just wanted to plug the Ultimate

889
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:35,440
Quest, the RPG podcast that's also on ultimatequest.net and ballgames.com. And you can listen to it

890
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:43,160
on Wednesdays at noon pacific or 3pm eastern time. Check it out if you haven't yet. Alright,

891
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,080
the Ultimate Quest, the ultimate podcast about roleplaying games. They certainly are more

892
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,340
educated on roleplaying games than we could ever be. So check that out on all games on

893
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:57,280
Wednesdays or their site, ultimatequest.net. Awesome. Congratulations Footy Monster. Thanks.

894
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:04,880
You're welcome. No problem. Now we're going to let you go. Bye. Bye Footy Monster. Alright.

895
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,160
That was a fun match game tonight even if it was a little bit random. What is it not?

896
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,440
I guess so. Alright. Anyways. More Skype calls later in the show but for now back to the

897
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,120
news. So, I think a while back we talked a little bit about how they were going to be

898
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:29,120
remaking Elevator Action for the Wii. Okay. Now they have a new game. It's, well, they

899
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,680
first off, their first step in remaking the game is changing the name entirely to something

900
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:41,560
really retarded called Spy Game Elevator Mission. And now it's a crappy looking gun game. Hooray!

901
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:51,040
And if they had some screenshots on this ds-x2.com site, oh my god does it look like shit. So,

902
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:59,100
I don't know. I only hope that that's just the DS screenshots although I think it's only

903
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:05,480
for the Wii. You know, those are Wii screenshots. Wow. One of those games I don't recommend

904
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,320
buying. I know it's coming out at the end of October for like $29.99. Probably not worth

905
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:17,720
$29.99 but hey, find it used. Rent it if you really want to. It might not be that bad.

906
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,100
Then again, it might be that bad. No, it looks really bad. I'll post some screens in the

907
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:26,760
chat. They should have made it a sequel to like Leisure Larry like Elevator Mission.

908
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:33,920
You mean Leisure Suit Larry? Yeah, whatever. Alright. I'm looking in our chat room here.

909
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,040
Corizzle's commenting on the match game tonight. Show tunes would have added to the randomness.

910
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,720
No show tunes tonight in match game. Go figure. It would have been one of my answers actually.

911
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,600
Just the questions just didn't work out that way. Moving on in the news, if you want to

912
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:56,060
go back to Halo 3, everybody's asking is Halo 3 it? I mean, I can't really talk about the

913
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:01,100
plot of Halo 3 but let's certainly say it makes people think that Halo 3 could be the

914
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:09,760
last game in the series. However, into which Eddie's going, oh man, Creamy River, meh.

915
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,380
However, community leader Brian Gerard has revealed that Bungie is at work on another

916
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:20,140
Halo game. It is based on the Halo universe and is a collaboration between Bungie and

917
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:26,160
Peter Jackson. Isn't that Halo Wars? No, but that announcement's been out for a while.

918
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,300
Yeah, that announcement was out there for a while, but it's not Halo 4. Some other Halo

919
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,580
universe project. I thought that announcement was already out there as well. I thought it

920
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,620
was supposed to be a movie or a game based on the supposed movie that they were going

921
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:45,740
to do. Yeah, who knows? Who knows? Apparently though, if they do want to make a Pimps at

922
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:50,220
Sea game, they do still have the ability to make that. Of course, the code name for Halo

923
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:57,580
when it was being developed was Pimps at Sea, which actually is a game I would want to play.

924
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:10,180
Who knows? Alright. So, for anyone who wanted the Halo movie, sucks to be you. It's dead.

925
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:19,520
It ain't happening. You've been shafted. Yeah. For the bits that were on TV, they had nothing

926
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:28,700
to do with the supposed movie. In fact, the powers that be are quoted saying, the film

927
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:34,580
is entirely dead. The configuration it was in, whatever happens with that movie, assuming

928
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:40,300
the movie gets made, will be a totally different configuration. It's not so much me as the

929
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:45,940
entire vessel sank. Basically, it was a combination of, and there were two studios involved that

930
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:51,580
weren't getting along in the process of making it, Universal and Fox. So, guess what sucks?

931
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:58,300
Well, if they're not going to make it, I'll buy that Warthog that they made for prop purposes.

932
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:06,340
That'd be kind of fun. You know, I'd rather they cancel the movie than make one that bastardizes

933
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,700
the entire series, to be honest. I think we can all agree on that. It's probably for the

934
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,260
best that they cancel the movie, as opposed to making one that will completely give the

935
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,900
series a bad name. Which, I'm wondering, if the World of Warcraft movie is really based

936
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:22,140
on the Alliance, maybe it should be Mercy Killed 2. I don't know. Because I heard the

937
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,980
World of Warcraft movie is based on the Alliance, and who wants to pay $9.50 to see that, honestly?

938
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,020
Yeah, the Horde's much better. Rice Princess is going to be in the theater

939
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,060
by herself. Much more angst and anger on the Horde.

940
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:37,260
All right. Pooface wanted to correct something I said, saying Pimps at Sea was a fake joke

941
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,540
project that Bungie announced. But I thought at one point during the alpha process, people

942
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,780
were seeing on Xbox Live playing Pimps at Sea. So, I think it was a little more than

943
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:50,260
just a fake project. Well, it started off, it was basically they were seeing playing

944
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:56,640
Pimps at Sea, which was the codename for Halo. And then for April Fool's Day, they created

945
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:02,540
a poster or box art or teaser for Pimps at Sea, which featured a parrot with a pirate

946
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:08,420
hook head. Which is pretty funny, actually. Now, I would go back to playing Puzzle Pirates

947
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,740
if it had that theme going on. I love Puzzle Pirates.

948
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,080
Yes, actually, I'm considering going back to it after not having played it for years.

949
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,420
You played Puzzle Pirates about as long as I played Final Fantasy XI, huh? You played

950
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,300
it a long time. I played it for about at least two years.

951
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,420
Wow. Wow.

952
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,260
That's hardcore. And it's still going, huh? Yeah, it's still going. They just, like in

953
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,940
the last month and a half or so, released a couple of new big features that actually

954
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:38,760
have made the game even more successful. And Three Rings is rolling in dough. And they

955
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:45,180
have the coolest fucking office ever. SSJ 100 Matt says if he could cast the Halo

956
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:49,900
movie, he might cast Horatio Sans as Master Chief. I think that might be a sure recipe

957
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,900
for disaster. What?

958
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,080
I think that's, no, I think that's more maybe why the movie got cancelled, who knows. Shadow

959
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,460
Next Gen says with the success of Halo 3, I find it hard to believe there won't be a

960
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,540
Halo movie. There's too much money to be made. Yeah, but they can make even more by just

961
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,980
making Halo 4. Yeah, but, you know, it would be nice if they

962
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:13,160
made a movie to fill in all the plot holes between the games.

963
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,340
For real. Whatever, minimal. It's more like a plot dashed

964
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,620
line. And Cortana can just randomly interrupt the

965
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:23,260
movie going like, eh, save me, Master Chief. No, I mean, because, like, I mean, yeah, playing

966
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:26,220
devil's, I mean, don't, don't people play it for the multimode? I mean, is it really

967
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:31,340
about the, the actual game? I mean, look at all the advertisements that

968
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:35,020
they did. I mean, they went through that whole process of like, oh, humanity's last hope

969
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:38,020
is Master Chief. Believe! No, look, if, if.

970
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,380
And it had nothing to do, those commercials had nothing to do with the game.

971
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,620
Y'all know that if the Halo movie gets cast, I am bidding for the role of Donut. Okay,

972
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:50,980
that's all I have to say. You have to watch, you have to watch Red vs Blue. Never mind.

973
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,020
Oh, wow. Forget it. I would think that more people would do that.

974
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:58,380
I love Donut. I love Donuts, too. Donuts, either way.

975
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:04,540
No, no, okay, just, just go on YouTube and look up Red vs Blue and Donut, D-O-N-U-T.

976
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,060
Or just go to Roosterteeth.com and view them all there.

977
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,420
It's not pink, it's lightish red! Or you can watch all the episodes on Xbox Live

978
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,400
Video Marketplace, or... Escapist says, I think there's a comic series

979
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,220
coming out that fills in the hole between Halo 2 and 3.

980
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:25,340
Fuck that, I ain't reading for shit! Why did they make me read?

981
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:30,460
And GS68 is basically saying that I can play Tingle, but only, quote, as long as Loki is

982
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:35,700
a Covenant alien in a Tingle costume. In the Halo movie.

983
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,700
The fuck does that have to do with anything? I don't know, but it would be funny. Who would?

984
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:45,180
Yes, they have some fascination with wanting to see me dress up as Tingle. I don't know

985
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,020
why. No, we actually made a bet a couple episodes

986
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,540
ago. We actually made this bet, and I'm totally

987
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,100
going to reiterate this for our listeners' benefit.

988
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,700
Loki said there is no way in hell the Eye of Judgment will be a success.

989
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,100
So what we made the bet is, if the Eye of Judgment sells one million units in the first

990
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,660
six months, then Loki will dress up in a Tingle costume, and skip around the garage while

991
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,900
we film him on the Eye of Judgment live in a match with Bobby Blackwolf, and then set

992
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,880
the Eye of Judgment on fire. Why has this not happened yet?

993
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,940
Because the Eye of Judgment has to sell a million units first.

994
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,660
We should still do it anyway. It did, it did.

995
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:27,780
We need to convince Joystick or Kotaku or something to run the story as a lie, just

996
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:33,700
so we can say, look, it happened. Where do you even find a Tingle costume?

997
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,420
Get a green leotard and a pair of red for the looms?

998
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,960
Rice Princess will have to get out her sewing kit.

999
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:45,460
First off, Rob, just so you know, I do get monthly sales numbers, you know, of each title

1000
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:52,180
individually, so we can tell if they've sold a million units or not.

1001
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,180
Well, shit.

1002
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,180
We could ruin the fun.

1003
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,180
Thank you, Debbie Downer.

1004
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,180
All right.

1005
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:02,860
Or, or he can just, you know, change the numbers if it actually does sell over a million.

1006
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,260
He has, he could say he has proof.

1007
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,260
Yeah, we'll see. All right, well, okay, moving on.

1008
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,540
First off, it'll never sell a million.

1009
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:17,260
Anyways, so, um, there's a lot of Command & Conquer going around, apparently.

1010
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:23,220
Electronic Arts announced this week that they'll release a Command & Conquer Saga, which is

1011
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,140
a compilation of 13 games in the series.

1012
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:31,860
Included in it will be the original Command & Conquer, Command & Conquer the Covert Operations,

1013
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,860
Command & Conquer Red Alert, Command & Conquer Red Alert Counter-Strike, Command & Conquer

1014
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:41,540
Red Alert the Aftermap, Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun, Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun

1015
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:47,960
Firestorm, Command & Conquer Red Alert 2, Command & Conquer Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge,

1016
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:52,420
Command & Conquer Renegade, Command & Conquer Generals, Command & Conquer Generals Zero

1017
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,020
Hour and finally, Command & Conquer 3 The Tiberian Games.

1018
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,960
Where do you have time to play all that?

1019
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,400
That will be coming out later this month for 50 bucks.

1020
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,640
Says the manual.

1021
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,840
...

1022
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:09,880
Rice Princess, do not say things unless you're going to say them in a microphone, because that joke is lost forever.

1023
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,280
Alright, anyhow, really quickly, I wanna mention this MMO,

1024
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,020
which is something I'm looking forward to, it's a sci-fi based MMO, and it's by

1025
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,240
Richard Garriott, who

1026
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,660
of course, was the guy behind Ultima. Hell yeah! Tabula Rasa

1027
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:28,300
is coming out! Hell yeah! Tabula Rasa is coming out,

1028
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:35,300
But a little later than originally intended. It was going to be out this month, but NCsoft has had to delay the release until November 2nd, but that's not that far back.

1029
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:39,300
It was originally going to come out October 19th. It's been delayed a couple weeks.

1030
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:47,300
So apparently there was a post on the game's official website. The game is having some stability and balance issues, so it's going to be in beta for just two more weeks.

1031
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,300
It's a sci-fi based MMO that looks like it could be kind of fun, so I'm going to check it out.

1032
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,300
And the main character is Tank Girl? What?

1033
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,300
Dude, Tank Girl is awesome.

1034
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:00,300
Kind of. I don't know. Well, you can customize your character. I can show you.

1035
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:08,300
I don't know how to describe how the game looks. I was looking at a trailer earlier today, and it looks like, I don't know, like, Fantasy Star Online meets MechWarriors or something. It's kind of crazy.

1036
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:13,300
But it looks like fun, so I'm going to check. I want to try a good sci-fi MMO. We'll see.

1037
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,300
So you said they're working on balance issues?

1038
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,300
Yes.

1039
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,300
You mean there's actually MMO companies that care about that?

1040
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,300
Apparently. I don't know.

1041
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,300
Lord knows there haven't been enough class changes in WoW.

1042
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:32,300
Well, you know, the good thing about MMOs is that they can keep changing it if it ain't broke. Or if it is broke.

1043
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,300
Well, Blizzard likes to break things a lot anyway.

1044
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,300
Apparently I'm broken, and I need to be changed.

1045
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,300
If it's broke, break it more. That's the way you do it.

1046
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,300
Let's finish up the gaming news so we can get calls and end the show already.

1047
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:49,300
Well, Nintendo is giving us a little love. They're offering a Zelda feather stylus.

1048
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,300
What?

1049
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,300
A feather?

1050
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:58,300
Yeah, it's this transparent feather-shaped plastic thingy.

1051
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:05,300
It's like if you are registering your copy of Phantom Hourglass on Nintendo's website, you can get a stylus that looks like a feather pen.

1052
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,300
But really all it is is a chunk of plastic that looks like a feather.

1053
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,300
Is it free?

1054
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,300
Yes, it's free.

1055
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,300
Oh.

1056
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,300
I would think they would at least be able to pay for it.

1057
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,300
Register it like you didn't steal it.

1058
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,300
I'll register mine and give it to you.

1059
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,300
And that puts the nail in the coffin on those stories.

1060
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:26,300
All right. Well, we're going to be getting to the Skype line very soon.

1061
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,300
But one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.

1062
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:36,300
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeloungeRadio.

1063
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,300
So we look forward to hearing your calls very soon.

1064
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,300
But first, one more story.

1065
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:49,300
Well, unfortunately, I guess Rockstar is going to be giving out a Manhunt 2 themed Wii.

1066
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:54,300
What's disappointing about the whole thing is the whole artwork is a sticker, basically.

1067
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,300
I mean, come on, that's a little cheap, don't you think?

1068
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:03,300
But it looks like the Wii has been, I don't know, through some medical waste or something.

1069
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,300
It's like covered in fake blood.

1070
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,300
But once again, it's a fucking sticker.

1071
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,300
I mean, seriously, pay for it to be airbrushed or something.

1072
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,300
I mean, come on, that's fucking lazy.

1073
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:19,300
Watch that be some sort of GameStop promo item or something that comes with the fucking game.

1074
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,300
I just like the idea of a bloody looking Wii.

1075
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:25,300
It's this weird paradox, because Nintendo's always been so family friendly,

1076
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,300
so to see the Wii all horrified is pretty cool.

1077
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,300
Maybe they'll just have a Wii on her period sit on it.

1078
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,300
That's disgusting.

1079
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,300
You know, the times I don't want you to have a mic, you somehow get one.

1080
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,300
Oh my god. Like titties you should forget about.

1081
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,300
It's like having extra fur on the show again.

1082
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,300
I know, totally.

1083
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:47,300
Alright, Skyblind is open. Give us a call. 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1084
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,300
The calls are already coming in.

1085
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,300
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

1086
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,300
Hey, it's Ronmo. What's up, everyone?

1087
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,300
Hello, Ronmo.

1088
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,300
What's up? How you doing?

1089
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:01,300
I'm doing good. I'm recovering from yet another convention I went to this weekend.

1090
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,300
What convention did you go to this weekend?

1091
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:12,300
It's Mong A Neck, a smaller, low-key convention geared towards Japanese comics and panels and cool stuff like that.

1092
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:17,300
And really quickly, sum us up for the con. What was the highlights?

1093
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:27,300
The 18-plus stuff, like 18-plus yaoi yuri dating game, the 18-plus match game that I ran, and cosplay chess.

1094
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:32,300
That's right. You asked us if you could steal the match game from us to play at the con, huh?

1095
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:39,300
I remember that. I was like, dude, it's a Mark Goodson production. It's not really our idea, so you'd rip it off just like we would, so there you go.

1096
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:45,300
That's okay. We recorded the whole thing, so we're going to try to dump it to DVD so I'll send you guys a copy of it.

1097
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,300
We'll see how rude and raunchy we got.

1098
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,300
Alright, sounds good. So what else is going on in your gaming world?

1099
00:58:50,300 --> 00:59:00,300
Not too much. From listening from last week, I figured I would call in and get a much better review of Digital Life.

1100
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,300
I'd like to hear it.

1101
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,300
Alright. I swear to God, if we get into the DDR contest, this is going to be a short call.

1102
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:09,300
Well, I wasn't even there for that.

1103
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,300
Oh, thank God. Alright, so then what was your review of Digital Life?

1104
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:22,300
The rating on a scale from 1 to 10, I'd have to give it a 6.5. I'd gone to 3 out of 4 past Digital Life.

1105
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:32,300
Last year, it was big in the terms of there's more vendors, there's more companies, more distributors showing off newer products and selling cool stuff.

1106
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:36,300
This year, it was like as if they really couldn't get too much of anything.

1107
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:43,300
I mean, last year, Game Cap was having a Street Fighter III tournament giving out a lot of cool stuff.

1108
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:48,300
You had Guitar Hero 2, Justice League Heroes, a bunch of other cool games.

1109
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:52,300
And you had two different sets of pro gaming tournaments going on.

1110
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:59,300
This year, the big things were the Namco display, even though it was the same one from last year.

1111
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,300
They were there. It was just a little bit bigger.

1112
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:07,300
Best Buy and Geek Squad were there. Intel showed up.

1113
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:11,300
I think it was Global Gaming League out there this year with Dell.

1114
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:18,300
They had famous people handing out autographs. They had a gamers lounge with the PMS clan.

1115
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,300
They had a little kid section for the kids to play games and stuff.

1116
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:26,300
Why do you think things got downgraded this year?

1117
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,300
That, I don't know. It didn't make any sense.

1118
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:35,300
Because when I got there, I got there Friday after work for about hours and change.

1119
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:41,300
I expected to be packed full of people, full of vendors and exhibits.

1120
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,300
And I didn't see it, you know?

1121
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:49,300
Do you think there's any correlation to the downsizing of E3 causing this?

1122
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:54,300
I have no idea because, honestly, what Digital Life is,

1123
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:59,300
is more of an expo on the latest digital innovations and technologies

1124
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:03,300
and some cool games that are coming out this year.

1125
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:07,300
Maybe what I think it was, so many people went last year thinking it was going to be all of this.

1126
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,300
And they figured, eh, what is it going to be so?

1127
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:14,300
But the thing was, almost everybody there got in for free

1128
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:19,300
because if you knew the proper code, which almost everybody knew,

1129
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:23,300
you said you spent about $6-$7 for entries for four straight days.

1130
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:27,300
Alright, so if you could give, just to kind of wrap things up here so we can get to some more calls,

1131
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:32,300
if you had any piece of advice to give the Digital Life planners for next year's show,

1132
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:36,300
what would you say?

1133
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,300
Keep the same people you got here, get some newer people,

1134
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,300
if you really want to expand and watch the game, get more companies in there.

1135
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,300
More free swag, definitely.

1136
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:49,300
Alright, more free swag. Free stuff is always a good thing.

1137
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:52,300
Oh, definitely. Last year I made like a bandit.

1138
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:57,300
Thanks so much for the call. Any last minute words you want to give our folks here?

1139
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,300
I love you, Irene.

1140
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:02,300
Thank you too, Ranma.

1141
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,300
Bye, Ranma. Take care.

1142
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,300
Come back out here and see us. Definitely.

1143
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,300
I will. I promise.

1144
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,300
Alright, you better.

1145
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,300
Alright, give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1146
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,300
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1147
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,300
Let's go to the phones.

1148
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,300
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

1149
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,300
Hola, como estas?

1150
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,300
It's your ex.

1151
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,300
Hi, Extifer.

1152
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,300
What?

1153
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,300
We were just talking about you.

1154
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,300
Oh, your ears must have been burning.

1155
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,300
Oh, really? No, I didn't hear. I haven't been listening.

1156
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:39,300
I've been watching freakin' Flavor of Love or whatever.

1157
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:42,300
How did you know to call us?

1158
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,300
Because I got a text from Irene saying you guys were taking calls.

1159
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,300
Dammit.

1160
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,300
I'm supposed to say it on the air.

1161
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:57,300
Well, is there anything you would like to share that's gaming-oriented with your week?

1162
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:02,300
Sure. I love Puzzle Quest and WoW still.

1163
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,300
Oh, Christopher, guess what?

1164
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:11,300
Did Annie tell you that I'm moving my orc from Elder Thallus, my 38, to Ravencrest?

1165
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,300
Really?

1166
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,300
Yeah.

1167
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,300
Oh, my goodness.

1168
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,300
I'm actually going to play on that server now.

1169
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,300
That's awesome news.

1170
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,300
Hey, Christopher. Hey, Christopher. It's Eddie the Gay.

1171
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,300
How's your iPhone doing?

1172
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:29,300
My iPhone is doing absolutely wonderful. Thank you for asking.

1173
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,300
Yeah, I miss it a lot.

1174
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,300
You do?

1175
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,300
Yes, I'm Eddie and I do.

1176
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,300
Brand new information, Eddie.

1177
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,300
Like everybody else's.

1178
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:44,300
What the hell happened to this show? I mean, it's like our 250th fucking episode, for God's sake.

1179
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:48,300
I always derail the show. It's my power.

1180
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,300
It's your mutant power.

1181
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,300
Hey, except for say, titty juice.

1182
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,300
No.

1183
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:56,300
Titty juice? What?

1184
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,300
All right.

1185
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,300
At least he didn't talk about bleached assholes.

1186
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:06,300
Did you hear that Puzzle Quest is supposed to be the next week's release on Xbox Live Arcade?

1187
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,300
That's nice. I'm still playing on my DS.

1188
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,300
Will you give Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live a try?

1189
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:15,300
No, I'm not. I'm Christopher and I will not.

1190
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,300
Why not?

1191
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,300
Because it's stupid.

1192
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:21,300
I don't have an Xbox 360, silly.

1193
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,300
Well, what if you had one? Let's imagine you had one. Would you pay the $15 to download it?

1194
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,300
No, my hands would fall off.

1195
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,300
No.

1196
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,300
What is your problem, Rice Princess?

1197
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,300
This is X-Topher.

1198
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,300
Sorry, X-Topher. What's your problem?

1199
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,300
Xbox 360, that's my problem.

1200
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,300
Wait, so what were you guys saying about me before I called?

1201
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:46,300
That's something about how you derail the show. And look, look what happened.

1202
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,300
I know. Look at me.

1203
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:56,300
I just want to take a moment and let everybody know that you guys need to think about me in the next two hours

1204
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:59,300
so they might find out if I get a promotion at work.

1205
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:05,300
I know that has nothing to do with video games, but think of me while you're playing your video games.

1206
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,300
Yes, it does because you're going to level up at work.

1207
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,300
Grats.

1208
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:15,300
I will. I will level up at work. I'll be plus infinity to pwnage, man.

1209
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,300
Yeah, man.

1210
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:23,300
No matter what, win or lose on the job thing, we're still going to go to Disneyland in a couple of weeks to celebrate, right?

1211
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,300
What does it have to do with video games, Ross?

1212
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,300
I want to go to Disneyland.

1213
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,300
This is what it has to do with video games because we're going to Disneyland

1214
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:34,300
and we're going to be in LA at the same time E for All is going on, but we're not going to E for All.

1215
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:39,300
By the way, a moment of silence from my premium annual pass which expired today.

1216
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:43,300
Did you know that you could play WoW at Disneyland for $7 an hour?

1217
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,300
I just farted.

1218
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,300
Why would I do that? Why?

1219
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,300
I didn't say you were going to, but you have the ability to.

1220
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,300
Really? Where is that? Because that's kind of a novelty thing.

1221
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,300
Why would you want to know? You wouldn't do that.

1222
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,300
I'm just curious. I'm going to take pictures of people who do.

1223
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,300
Look, if I know you think I've ever been to Disneyland, geez. Someone just told me.

1224
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,300
Look it up, noob.

1225
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,300
Stop being so poor.

1226
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,300
No.

1227
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,300
All right.

1228
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:04,300
I want to be poor.

1229
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,300
All right. Any last words for our listeners, Extrofer?

1230
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:12,300
Die? No, I'm kidding. Live, people, live.

1231
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,300
Rude. All right, live.

1232
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,300
You look beautiful.

1233
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,300
Bye.

1234
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,300
Bye, Christopher.

1235
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,300
Bye.

1236
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,300
All right, let's get some more calls.

1237
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:31,300
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1238
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:37,300
Waiting for some calls. Just waiting for some calls.

1239
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,300
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

1240
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,300
It's GS68.

1241
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,300
Hello, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?

1242
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:47,300
I'm still playing Maximum Tune 3. I finally got the soundtrack this week.

1243
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:56,300
Damn it. I saw somebody linked me. I don't know if it was you or somebody linked me to where I could obtain the soundtrack for a low, low, low cost.

1244
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,300
A zero.

1245
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,300
Oh, no, it was just a very low cost.

1246
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,300
What was the soundtrack?

1247
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,300
Midnight Maximum Tune 3.

1248
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:07,300
Oh, that just really sucks that you don't have that yet. Do you have that?

1249
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:11,300
Well, maybe you could play it for me.

1250
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,300
Over and over.

1251
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:18,300
Yes, on my iPod. Anyway, okay, so tell me a little bit about Maximum Tune 3.

1252
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,300
I would also like to hear it.

1253
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,300
The soundtrack?

1254
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,300
Mm-hmm.

1255
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:33,300
Yeah, it's very good so far. Especially the songs. One song that sticks out is Black Pressure.

1256
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:42,300
It's not the original Maximum Tune soundtrack. There's a song called Destination Black and it's the Blackbirds theme.

1257
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,300
Why's it always got to be about the black songs?

1258
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:57,300
Yeah, well, this song starts off with some choir chanting and that's what made it stand out from the other songs.

1259
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:59,300
But it's still Eurobeat, right?

1260
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:04,300
No, still, wait, Eurobeat?

1261
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:09,300
No, you're thinking of Initial D, silly. You think of Initial D as the Eurobeat music.

1262
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,300
Well, it still kind of is.

1263
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:15,300
It's more of a Euro rave or something. I don't know how to explain it.

1264
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:21,300
But is number three as good of a soundtrack as number two, if not better?

1265
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:26,300
Oh, I'm liking it better. It has more, I'm working out all the songs in my car.

1266
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,300
Is it good driving music?

1267
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:33,300
Yeah, it's pretty good, but only when you're driving.

1268
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,300
Just make sure to obey those speed laws, son.

1269
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:40,300
Yeah, the problem is it's not very good music to listen to in traffic jams.

1270
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:43,300
It's probably not because then you want to run over the cars like it's burnt out.

1271
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:53,300
Or I'm going to stop. I just pause the music and rewind it back because I don't want to be listening to that kind of music when I stop because it wouldn't feel right.

1272
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:58,300
All right, well, appreciate the review of the soundtrack. Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1273
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:05,300
Yeah, J.P. Moss's Speedcar is horrible. It's an okay song, but it's the cheesiest song I've ever heard.

1274
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,300
Which song was this?

1275
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,300
Speedcar, the one I was singing last week.

1276
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,300
Oh, okay. Cheesy. All right.

1277
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:15,300
All right, well, thank you, GS68, for the phone call. Appreciate it.

1278
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,300
No problem.

1279
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,300
Take care, buddy.

1280
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:25,300
All right. We'll do one more call. 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1281
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:31,300
Give us a call. We'll talk. Our number is 555-4444. No, just kidding.

1282
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:36,300
We're waiting for that call. Oh, here we go. Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1283
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,300
This is Pooface.

1284
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,300
Pooface, what's on your mind, buddy?

1285
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:47,300
I was just going to say how I'm really looking forward to Half-Life 2, the Orange Box.

1286
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:50,300
What is it about the Orange Box that has you so excited?

1287
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:56,300
I've just been really... I really got into Half-Life 2, and Portal looks really sweet.

1288
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:04,300
Like, I played the project thing, the Narbacular Drop game. That was pretty cool, but it was really short.

1289
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,300
And Portal looks like it's going to make it a lot better.

1290
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:11,300
And, of course, there's Half-Life 2 Episode 2, which continues the story of Half-Life 2.

1291
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:15,300
And Team Fortress 2, I've been playing the beta for a couple weeks. That's pretty sweet.

1292
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:23,300
All I'm hoping is that later on, as a downloadable piece, that they have Garry's Mod, because that would be so awesome.

1293
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:26,300
It's my crap PC at home. Can't run Half-Life 2.

1294
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:32,300
Portal looks kind of interesting, but I can't help but think, didn't Prey have something similar, where you have the little portals?

1295
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:33,300
No one played Prey.

1296
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:39,300
I know. I played Prey. The one first-person shooter I did play was Prey. I beat Prey.

1297
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:47,300
I played Prey. Yeah, I beat Prey. That was pretty cool, and that was what got me looking at Portal, because I thought the portals in Prey were pretty cool.

1298
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,300
I think they just switched the graphics and made it the same game.

1299
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,300
Yeah.

1300
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,300
So, wait. Now, I see...

1301
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,300
It's a great month.

1302
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,300
Hold on. I have to say this, because I...

1303
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,300
It's a great month. Hang on. Okay.

1304
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:02,300
Uh-huh. Well, I see Casper the Gay over here in studio rolling his eyes at this talk of first-person shooters.

1305
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:08,300
So, I need to give you a few seconds to try and sell Portal as what is so great about, what looks so awesome about Portal.

1306
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:15,300
Even if you don't like first-person shooters, it's not even necessarily a first-person shooter. It's more of a first-person, like, puzzle game.

1307
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:28,300
Like, it's really original, and it just looks like a lot of fun, and especially for the PC version, because people are going to be coming out with mods, like, for multiplayer, probably, and custom maps.

1308
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:36,300
No, that's fair, because I liked Metroid for that reason, just because it's not a shooter, really. It's like an adventure, first-person adventure game, so good stuff.

1309
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,300
That and your total Nintendo fanboy.

1310
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:41,300
Yeah, whatever. No, but I don't like first-person shooters on any system, even PC, so...

1311
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,300
I get Uber motion sick.

1312
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,300
All right. Anyhow, sorry, Pooface, you had another thought I cut you off from.

1313
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,300
What's a fight in the days of Hexen?

1314
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:54,300
Uh, well, yeah, I've also been looking forward to Guitar Hero 3, obviously.

1315
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,300
I'm totally looking forward to Guitar Hero 3.

1316
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,300
Me, too.

1317
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:02,300
Because I actually have a guitar. So, it's like, I only have to buy the game, and no fucking peripheral this time.

1318
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:07,300
Unlike Rock Band, where I'm going to have to buy the Uber box, where nobody's going to want to come over and play with me.

1319
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,300
No, they're not.

1320
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:14,300
Yeah, I'm actually getting Drum Mania instead of Rock Band.

1321
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:17,300
Are you importing the one from Japan?

1322
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,300
Yeah.

1323
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,300
That's hardcore.

1324
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:25,300
But I don't have the money to get the arcade-style DTX drum set, so I'm just getting the Konami controller.

1325
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:30,300
Well, there you go. That'll do, as long as it gets you through the game. That's all that's important.

1326
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:35,300
All right, well, it sounds like you have a very busy gaming next couple of months between Orange Box and Drum Mania.

1327
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:39,300
You're going to be very busy. Any other last-minute thoughts for our listeners?

1328
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,300
Uh, no.

1329
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:44,300
All right. Well, Puface, thank you very much for the call. Have a wonderful week.

1330
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,300
All right.

1331
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,300
Hope to hear from you again.

1332
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,300
Yeah.

1333
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,300
All right. Bye-bye.

1334
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:53,300
Puface hasn't been listening for a little while. He just returned tonight for our 250th episode, so happy to hear from him.

1335
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:57,300
I'd like to remind everybody that I had the Orange Box last year.

1336
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,300
Hm?

1337
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,300
Yeah, I had the Orange Box last year. In fact, I still have it.

1338
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,300
Oh.

1339
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,300
I don't really use it too much, though.

1340
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,300
Isn't that what you called something of yours? I don't know. All right.

1341
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,300
What?

1342
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,300
Hello?

1343
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,300
Hi.

1344
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,300
It's Ravenstaufen.

1345
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,300
And Mr. Bucket.

1346
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,300
Hello.

1347
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:19,300
We just want to wish you a happy 250th episode from the Tekken Game Podcast.

1348
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,300
Aww.

1349
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:25,300
That's so nice to hear from podcasts who are whooping our ass on Operator 11 rankings.

1350
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,300
That's great.

1351
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,300
For sure.

1352
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:31,300
I'm glad that you guys are thinking of the little people in your lives, like us.

1353
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,300
Little people?

1354
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,300
You're bigger than us.

1355
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,300
I'm glad to hear that we're not.

1356
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,300
Yeah, you probably are.

1357
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,300
It's all good.

1358
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:40,300
No, but seriously, you guys are like on the Operator 11 top of the charts. It's pretty rad.

1359
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,300
Not anymore.

1360
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,300
We were first, and now we're number 14. We're slightly getting back up there.

1361
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,300
It's okay. We're like number 16.

1362
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,300
Yeah, we don't care, though.

1363
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,300
We're number 69, which is an okay place to be, honestly.

1364
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,300
It's hilarious.

1365
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,300
It's a great place to be.

1366
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,300
It's a great place to be.

1367
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,300
That's an awesome place.

1368
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,300
Oh, yeah.

1369
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,300
Great for 69.

1370
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,300
That's my producer, Toki. She produces the show.

1371
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,300
Hello.

1372
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,300
Wow, there's a lot of you.

1373
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,300
Hi.

1374
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,300
Wait, do you all?

1375
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,300
Yeah.

1376
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,300
Oh, it's a girl. Hello.

1377
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:03,300
She's my co-host.

1378
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,300
All right.

1379
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:08,300
God, what was I going to ask? I don't know.

1380
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,300
Is she hot?

1381
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,300
Rice Princess wants to know if she's hot.

1382
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,300
Why are you...

1383
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,300
I think so.

1384
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,300
All right.

1385
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:19,300
Yeah, Raven and her, they've been together for like six months now.

1386
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,300
Is there a little showmance going?

1387
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:21,300
I think the bucket's serious.

1388
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,300
Is there a showmance going on on Tekken Games?

1389
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:25,300
No, no, no, no. Not at all.

1390
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,300
Okay, it's all a publicity stunt.

1391
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,300
I can hear her in the background going,

1392
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,300
What are you guys doing?

1393
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,300
What are you guys doing?

1394
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,300
I'm not your publicity stunt.

1395
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:35,300
Oh, we tried to fake it like you guys had a child or something that was like illegitimate.

1396
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:36,300
We never did.

1397
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,300
All right.

1398
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:39,300
Sorry, we did call in for something, Sky.

1399
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,300
All right, what's up?

1400
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,300
We want to talk about the Orange Box.

1401
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,300
Ah, it's all the rage this week.

1402
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,300
Tell us about...

1403
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:49,300
You know, it would make sense that people think the Orange Lounge show is about the Orange Box, so we forgive the confusion.

1404
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,300
Orange Box radio.

1405
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:52,300
Tell us about the Orange Box.

1406
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,300
Did you see the commercial?

1407
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,300
You should call our show next week, Orange Box Radio.

1408
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:57,300
Just to fuck with people.

1409
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,300
That's stupid.

1410
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,300
It is stupid. All right, what do you want to say about Orange Box?

1411
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,300
Did you see the commercial?

1412
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,300
The commercial for the Orange Box?

1413
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,300
Yes, I did.

1414
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,300
It was during the Sarah Silverman program.

1415
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,300
I saw the commercial for the Orange Box.

1416
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,300
Did you hear what they said about Half-Life?

1417
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,300
Oh, God, you were watching that.

1418
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,300
No, what did...or what?

1419
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,300
Like Game of the Year or something?

1420
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,300
Yeah, greatest game ever.

1421
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,300
Greater than Zelda, greater than anything.

1422
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,300
Greatest game ever.

1423
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:27,300
I loved it that they said, this is the game of the year in 2002.

1424
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:30,300
Well, I mean, like, come on, when they sell movies, like when they do...

1425
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,300
That is us.

1426
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:38,300
When they do, like, DVDs, like, you know, they're going to release Unforgiven Special Edition on HD DVD.

1427
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:43,300
This was the best movie of the year in 1994, you know?

1428
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,300
Yeah, that commercial pisses me off.

1429
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:50,300
It's like, greatest game of all time, greater than Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time.

1430
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,300
You know what, I forgive them.

1431
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,300
Do they actually say that in the commercial?

1432
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:54,300
I forgive them.

1433
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:55,300
They should.

1434
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,300
That's hilarious.

1435
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,300
Yeah, they actually said, greatest game of all time.

1436
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,300
That's hilarious.

1437
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,300
You know why I forgive them?

1438
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:04,300
Because when we try to sell our show to other people, like, you know, why they should come on our show and why we're a cool show,

1439
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:09,300
we always say, hey, we're the podcast award-winning podcast in 2005.

1440
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,300
Yeah.

1441
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:15,300
All I can do is say, hey, our podcast is award-winning.

1442
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,300
Exactly.

1443
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,300
We've won awards.

1444
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,300
We've got, like, two thumbs up from some guy on podcast.

1445
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:23,300
We go like, hey, we're a four-time nominee for Best of Life 365 in 2003.

1446
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,300
Yeah, look at the iTunes store.

1447
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,300
We've got some good reviews, man.

1448
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,300
None of that pew-pew-pew shit.

1449
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,300
We've got some good reviews.

1450
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,300
Yeah, it's that creator, Scott.

1451
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,300
We don't get no mew-mew-mews.

1452
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,300
We've got some, like, good stuff, people saying we're the greatest.

1453
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:38,300
I mean, you should get on here so people can hear you and you've got awards.

1454
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,300
All right.

1455
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,300
Well, guys, we've got to let you go.

1456
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,300
We've got to wrap up the show because, damn, we've been going a long time.

1457
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,300
It's okay.

1458
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,300
Thank you for letting us get on.

1459
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,300
You're welcome.

1460
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,300
Have a good one, you guys.

1461
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,300
You, too.

1462
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,300
Bye.

1463
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,300
Bye.

1464
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,300
backwards completely lives.

1465
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,300
Bye, producer.

1466
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,300
Have a good one.

1467
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,300
Bye.

1468
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:54,300
Bye.

1469
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,300
They hung up on us.

1470
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,300
See you later.

1471
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:57,300
All right.

1472
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,300
That's it.

1473
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,300
We're going to close up the Skype line.

1474
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,300
Thank you guys very much for calling in tonight.

1475
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,300
It was fun.

1476
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:05,300
But now we need to wrap up the show because we've been going a long time tonight.

1477
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,300
First, any last-minute stories?

1478
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:07,300
Yes.

1479
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:08,300
All right.

1480
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:09,300
Okay.

1481
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,300
Let's get real small here.

1482
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:17,020
The Simple Series, one of my favorite things to talk about from D3, is coming to the Wii.

1483
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:19,460
I have the first few titles.

1484
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,740
These are all, of course, coming to Japan.

1485
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:30,500
The first one is the Mina de Cart Race.

1486
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,500
Everybody Cart Race.

1487
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,500
Yes.

1488
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,500
Everybody Cart Race.

1489
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,500
It's slated for October 25th.

1490
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:44,620
They also have Mina de Basuri Taikai, or the Everybody's Fishing Conference, also coming

1491
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:48,340
out on the 25th.

1492
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:50,820
The Party Casino, coming in December.

1493
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:55,940
The Shooting Action, coming in December.

1494
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:02,460
The Block Kuzushi, or the Block Destructions, coming out February next year.

1495
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:09,100
And the YY Combat, which I have no translation for, also coming in February.

1496
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:14,460
And I guess the Onichan Bara R is supposed to be coming out to the Wii, and that's that

1497
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,660
one for those who don't remember.

1498
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:23,260
It's the Sexy Zombie Killer Game, which is basically the chick wearing just brown panties

1499
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:27,220
and a cowboy hat with a samurai sword killing zombies.

1500
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:28,220
What more would you like?

1501
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,220
I mean, seriously.

1502
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:35,980
I don't know, it's not the fishing conference game, I don't know, I'm going to be busy playing

1503
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:36,980
that.

1504
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:41,460
Anyways, other things in the room middle here on the Wii, and this is probably just going

1505
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:46,700
to happen at some point, Nintendo's supposedly working on a game that's going to support

1506
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:50,460
the Wii Balance Board that's going to be a snowboarding title, and rumors are that it's

1507
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:55,300
going to be the 1080 game coming back, so maybe?

1508
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:00,420
I mean, I'm assuming someday there'll be a snowboarding game that'll support that.

1509
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:06,380
And then finally, one piece of Wii accessories that will not be coming out to the market

1510
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:10,100
will be the Nyko Wii Party Station.

1511
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:13,900
If you remember, that's that stupid thing that they had to hold controllers, chips and

1512
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,260
soda and all sorts of stuff like that.

1513
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:21,680
Apparently, originally they were marketing that as $25, but it ended up having to come

1514
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:28,420
out for the price of $50, and so no one decided to buy it.

1515
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:33,420
Oh, and by the way, I also had LED scoreboards for your Wii tournaments.

1516
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:35,740
I mean, seriously.

1517
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38,260
Whatever happened to the Wii-like thing that would hold the beer?

1518
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,620
Oh, is that the same thing?

1519
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:41,620
Oh, okay.

1520
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,620
Yeah.

1521
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:45,900
So, it's not coming out anymore, because apparently it's too expensive to make.

1522
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:46,900
What?

1523
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:47,900
What?

1524
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:48,900
What?

1525
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:49,900
What?

1526
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:50,900
That is it.

1527
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:51,900
Okay.

1528
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:52,900
Dark Sakura, you have anything?

1529
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,340
No, I have nothing.

1530
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,340
Me neither.

1531
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,340
All right.

1532
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:58,340
Nothing.

1533
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,340
Nothing to say.

1534
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:03,260
Well, that is going to bring our 250th episode to a close, and that deserves applause.

1535
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:04,740
Thank God it's over.

1536
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:05,940
All right.

1537
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:09,620
But first, we have to get everybody's final thought, so we'll start off with Dark Sakura.

1538
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:12,020
Your final thought tonight?

1539
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:13,780
I like beer.

1540
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:14,780
Do you now?

1541
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:15,780
Is there any particular type of beer?

1542
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:16,780
I like Newcastle.

1543
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:17,780
All right.

1544
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:19,900
We'll go around in a circle here.

1545
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,540
Casper the Gay, your final thought tonight?

1546
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:22,820
Thanks for being here, by the way.

1547
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:26,300
When you play video games, children do learn.

1548
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,300
What?

1549
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,300
Nobody got that.

1550
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,820
All righty.

1551
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:34,420
Rice Princess, your final thought?

1552
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:35,660
Bye.

1553
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:39,180
Loki, your final thought?

1554
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:44,260
And just when you thought Sony was done with releasing new secues, there is another rumor

1555
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:46,100
coming out of Japan.

1556
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:49,340
About a 160 gigabyte ES3 system.

1557
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:50,340
Oh, yes.

1558
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:55,480
This will come with 160 gigabytes of memory on your hard drive there.

1559
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:02,320
It will also feature six USB ports, two HDMI outs, and the three Ethernet ports, much like

1560
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,980
the original design that they showed.

1561
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:11,340
And actually, they have a brand new skew that's been logged in, and it will do your dishes

1562
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,340
and suck your dick.

1563
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:15,420
In related news, Japanese men everywhere are marrying their PlayStations.

1564
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:19,620
Why the fuck does it need three fucking Ethernet ports, is what I want to know.

1565
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:23,220
Seriously, what the fuck do you need that many Ethernet ports for?

1566
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:26,340
I don't get it.

1567
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:28,900
Nobody understands that.

1568
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:29,900
Wow.

1569
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:30,900
All right.

1570
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:31,900
Is that it, Loki?

1571
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:32,900
That's it.

1572
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:38,940
And I'm sure, as with all other Sony rumors, it will probably become true soon enough.

1573
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,340
All right.

1574
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:41,740
Puppy, your final thought?

1575
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:42,740
Thank you for being here tonight.

1576
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:43,740
My final thought?

1577
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:44,740
Yes.

1578
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:45,740
Believe.

1579
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:48,340
All right.

1580
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,340
My final thought?

1581
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:51,260
Master Chief will save us.

1582
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:56,260
My final thought is 250 episodes later, and you know what?

1583
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:59,340
George Takei is still awesome.

1584
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,580
He is still fucking awesome.

1585
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:02,580
Oh my.

1586
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,100
All right.

1587
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,300
That's going to do it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.

1588
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:10,060
Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

1589
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,580
If you like what you hear, remember we do this shit for free.

1590
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:14,660
All we ask is for a little word of mouth.

1591
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:15,660
Just go advertise.

1592
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:16,740
Tell two people about our show.

1593
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:21,140
If you have no friends, or even if you do have friends, leave a comment on the iTunes.

1594
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,420
Are you Ron Popeil now?

1595
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:23,420
Am I Ron Popeil?

1596
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:24,420
Yeah.

1597
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:26,580
For only three low payments of $39.90.

1598
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,580
No.

1599
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:28,580
No.

1600
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:31,340
Three low payments of $14.95.

1601
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:32,660
Forget it.

1602
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:33,660
Word of mouth.

1603
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:37,100
What was it that Mitch Hedberg said?

1604
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,580
Three easy payments and one difficult payment?

1605
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:40,580
Yes.

1606
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:44,900
No, I think that was actually, it was the other, no, it was the guy who...

1607
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,900
That was Mitch Hedberg.

1608
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:46,900
Mitch Hedberg.

1609
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:47,900
I just listened to this on Friday at work.

1610
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,900
That was good.

1611
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:49,900
Sorry.

1612
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,900
I thought you said Dane Cook for some reason.

1613
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:54,180
No, Dane Cook would have just made obnoxious noises and then talked about his penis.

1614
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:55,180
Yeah.

1615
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,180
No.

1616
01:22:56,180 --> 01:23:01,220
The thing was I somehow got my list of comedians who died mixed with comedians I wish would

1617
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:02,580
die.

1618
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:03,580
Just kidding.

1619
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:04,580
I don't wish death on anyone.

1620
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,580
That's really mean.

1621
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:06,580
I love Dane Cook.

1622
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:07,580
No, I don't.

1623
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:08,580
All right.

1624
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:10,260
Anyway, can we end the show now please?

1625
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:11,260
Thank you.

1626
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:12,260
All right.

1627
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,260
Bye-bye.
