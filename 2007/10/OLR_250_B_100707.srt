4
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:29,158
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live here on this Sunday evening, October the 7th, 2007, for part B of our 250th weekly episode.

6
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:31,762
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 250 weeks in a row, give or take a few.

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's applaud.

8
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:36,150
[SPEAKER_04]: We're testing out our new applause light tonight, everybody.

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,071
[SPEAKER_17]: It just means that we've had nothing to do on a Sunday night now for how long?

11
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:41,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

12
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:43,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've gotten emails about this before.

13
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:46,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how do you guys manage to motivate yourselves to do it every week?

14
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just kind of go, well, we just do it.

15
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:50,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It's our club.

16
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:53,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people go to knitting clubs.

17
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:54,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people go to church.

18
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:55,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Do or do not.

19
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,035
[SPEAKER_17]: There is no try.

20
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:58,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people go to poker.

21
00:00:58,255 --> 00:00:59,876
[SPEAKER_04]: We do a radio show on the internet.

22
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:00,976
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people go to bingo.

23
00:01:00,996 --> 00:01:01,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

24
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,057
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people go to a bar and get pissed, by the way.

25
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, back to the news.

26
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:07,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Bungie, Bungie, Bungie, Bungie.

27
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:09,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people play Halo religiously every Sunday night.

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I like the word Bungie, and I like saying it repeatedly.

29
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:13,482
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like balls.

30
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:16,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Just one of those words that makes you laugh.

31
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:17,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Well.

32
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:23,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, Bungie has decided to be independent once again.

33
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:25,268
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what this means?

34
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:30,150
[SPEAKER_17]: This means we could very well get Bungie games on a system that isn't an Xbox.

35
00:01:31,914 --> 00:01:33,574
[SPEAKER_05]: They could go back to Mac games.

36
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:40,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Halo for the iMac.

37
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:41,456
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know what?

38
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:42,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It would look better.

39
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:44,356
[SPEAKER_17]: It would probably look better.

40
00:01:46,457 --> 00:01:49,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Because what does graphics better, Mac or PC?

41
00:01:49,717 --> 00:01:50,337
[SPEAKER_17]: The Mac.

42
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:51,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

43
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:53,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be determined, actually.

44
00:01:56,058 --> 00:01:57,639
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this battle is not happening tonight.

45
00:01:58,739 --> 00:01:59,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Microsoft

46
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:11,378
[SPEAKER_17]: is going to continue keeping up with the Halo franchise and continue to partner with Bungie on games however we could have another Rare on our hands

47
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Killer Instinct 3 by Bungie

48
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:43,078
[SPEAKER_04]: But she's still got to turn tricks for me whenever I want, basically, is what it is.

49
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:44,659
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like the pimp in his hoe.

50
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of, yeah.

51
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:45,940
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm saying.

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,181
[SPEAKER_04]: So the hoe's still got to put out when I need it, right?

53
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:48,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

54
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:49,682
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

55
00:02:50,342 --> 00:02:54,805
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, then that makes me think, what in their right mind is Microsoft going to pass on?

56
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:56,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Bungie makes a lot, a lot of hits.

57
00:02:57,046 --> 00:03:05,191
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think the only way they're going to pass is if Bungie says, hey, we want to make a game starring Mario, or we want to make a game starring...

58
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:07,205
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the Sony franchise?

59
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:07,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Ratchet and Clank?

60
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:09,547
Spyro?

61
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:10,668
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make one of these games.

62
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Spyro, yes.

63
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:11,949
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make a Spyro game.

64
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:13,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not a Sony franchise anymore.

65
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Banjo-Kazooie?

66
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:15,111
[SPEAKER_04]: No, anyhow.

67
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:16,592
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that was Nintendo.

68
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:17,193
[SPEAKER_17]: That was Nintendo.

69
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:20,155
[SPEAKER_17]: Crash Bandicoot.

70
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:20,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet Tooth.

71
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:22,417
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

72
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:23,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet Tooth.

73
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:30,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight in chat, chat.orangelauncher.com says, Marathon, Kthanks, and GS191 says, I think it's time to revisit the Marathon series.

74
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:34,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma says, and Halo was originally developed for the PC before Microsoft bought them.

75
00:03:35,027 --> 00:03:35,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

76
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:40,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, your comments in chat, chat.orangeontrade.com when we tape live every Sunday night.

77
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:51,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so as we've been talking for the past few weeks now, there's this new SKU that people keep talking about, the Xbox 360 Arcade console.

78
00:03:52,556 --> 00:04:01,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's been listed on a few retail sites now, Toys R Us being one of them, another one being Amazon.com, both having it showing as being released on the 23rd.

79
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,123
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

80
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:37,084
[SPEAKER_03]: All for the same price as the current core system, which is $279.99 in the U.S.

81
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:44,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you will not be surprised to see this come out.

82
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:51,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this story just goes to prove that rumors about Microsoft are always true.

83
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:52,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, right?

84
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:54,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this rumor about the arcade thing has been going around forever.

85
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:58,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Forever, and they have screenshots taken from the website.

86
00:04:58,388 --> 00:04:58,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

87
00:04:59,168 --> 00:04:59,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

88
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:00,938
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

89
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:29,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

90
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:31,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Pardon the man behind the curtain there.

91
00:05:32,384 --> 00:05:33,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay no attention to him.

92
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:34,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to Halo 3.

93
00:05:34,405 --> 00:05:35,166
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

94
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:37,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3 is in the news, and we love Halo 3.

95
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,969
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the hatred for Halo 3 over here, Casper?

96
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't hate Halo 3.

97
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,373
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a boring, generic space fighter game that I'm just indifferent about.

98
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Says Metroid.

99
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:50,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but have you played the multiplayer game?

100
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:52,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

101
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:53,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

102
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:55,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to get into the Halo game?

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's where 73% of people go.

104
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I just want to say this.

105
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:06,476
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Japanese software charts this week, Halo 3 actually managed to top the charts in Japan.

106
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:14,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, keep in mind, though, that's if you separate two of the Pokemon games, of these Pokemon games, if you separate the two Pokemon games, then Halo 3 was number one.

107
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:21,167
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is just kind of a for people who said that Halo would not do well in Japan and the Japanese hate Halo and blah, blah, blah.

108
00:06:21,187 --> 00:06:28,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to actually say I got, because I really suck at Halo, I got my ass kicked by a Japanese player the other day on Halo and it made me feel

109
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:37,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3 moved 59,000 copies, but it should be said Pokemon's Mysterious Dungeon Toki moved 55,000 copies, but there's another version called Yami which moved 46,000 copies, but they're counted separately.

110
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:56,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Gears of War PC

111
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:26,655
[SPEAKER_17]: which we all know was an Xbox 360 title.

112
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:33,059
[SPEAKER_17]: There are five new single-player parts of the game, new campaigns.

113
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Or, I'm sorry, there are new places to explore in the main campaign.

114
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:42,183
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's also an encounter with the, what's it called, Bromak?

115
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:45,405
[SPEAKER_17]: That's from the end of Act 1 in the 360 version.

116
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:47,986
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess it's this big dinosaur.

117
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:50,507
[SPEAKER_17]: I've never played it.

118
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:52,488
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big creature thing.

119
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:54,679
[SPEAKER_03]: They had it in the trailers and stuff.

120
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

121
00:07:56,201 --> 00:08:00,804
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, they've also, of course, expanded the multiplayer options.

122
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:05,648
[SPEAKER_17]: They have a bunch of new maps.

123
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:12,374
[SPEAKER_17]: They've improved graphic quality and resolution so that if your machine is beefy enough, it'll make it look sweet.

124
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,939
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't have, though, the four-player co-op.

125
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:23,181
[SPEAKER_04]: Gears of War was really fucking hard, especially if you don't play first person shooters.

126
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,202
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot.

127
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:47,464
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably wouldn't like the multiplayer in it.

128
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:49,025
[SPEAKER_03]: And the multiplayer is kind of... I don't know.

129
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:50,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like the multiplayer for Gears of War.

130
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:54,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play it that much either, though, so I can't really judge it too much.

131
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo's fun.

132
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:02,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you're going to compare just straight graphics, then Gears of War fucking kicks the crap out of Halo 3.

133
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:07,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, too, you know, a bit of semantics here.

134
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Gears of War came out last year.

135
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:09,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did it?

136
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:11,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was like... No, in November.

137
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:12,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn it.

138
00:09:12,143 --> 00:09:12,884
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, then never mind.

139
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:18,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then wait, but they're still out within a year of each other, so the question still works.

140
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:19,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

141
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, how about this?

142
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:27,845
[SPEAKER_17]: If you were a completely new player sitting down and you played through Gears of War and you played through Halo, what would be your opinion?

143
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:28,345
[SPEAKER_17]: How's that?

144
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:32,327
[SPEAKER_04]: My thing is I love co-op mode in both of the games.

145
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:36,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they both have a stellar co-op mode, and more games should have co-op mode in them because it makes the game fun.

146
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:37,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Quit falling asleep over there, Eddie.

147
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:43,933
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as I just didn't like the cover system in Gears of War, so Halo 3 is more the game for me.

148
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:45,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like the cover thing.

149
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:46,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Say what you will.

150
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:47,653
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that.

151
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:53,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm sorry, we're putting the Nintendo fanboy to sleep, so we better move on with some news.

152
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:54,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So sorry to inconvenience you.

153
00:09:55,796 --> 00:10:00,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll just get some completely random news, Loki, to wake Eddie up over there.

154
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:06,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, something very inconceivable has happened, and they have...

155
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:35,585
[SPEAKER_03]: they have decided to make a Princess Bride game which is going to be they're going to be releasing I guess sort of a demo version of it to coincide with the 20th anniversary DVD of it and it will be I guess the True Love and High Adventure the official Princess Bride game only one little problem though is that it is going to be a casual game so at least by the sounds of it so far

156
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:36,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Wuv, Twiwuv

157
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:07,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of them.

158
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:11,881
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to go there.

159
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:19,968
[SPEAKER_03]: No, honestly, I've never heard of Worldwide Biggies, which can be found at www.biggies.com.

160
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:23,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

161
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:28,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not familiar with any of their games, so I can't say if it's going to be good.

162
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:30,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well...

163
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:35,849
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sleep all you want through the Halo and the Gears of War news, Eddie.

164
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:37,329
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've got to admit, this is good.

165
00:11:37,349 --> 00:11:38,910
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Halo being used for a good cause.

166
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,890
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a group called the Cave Girls who put this together.

167
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,131
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously, it's like a gaming group called the Cave Girls put this together.

168
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:47,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tournament called the Fight Like a Girl Halo Tournament.

169
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:49,492
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's being held this year on October 20th.

170
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:50,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's on Xbox Live.

171
00:11:50,972 --> 00:11:52,753
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a $10 entry fee.

172
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:54,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody can sign up and it takes place.

173
00:11:54,973 --> 00:11:57,613
[SPEAKER_04]: All the proceeds go towards the fight against breast cancer.

174
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,994
[SPEAKER_04]: So the tournament is being used to raise money.

175
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,083
[SPEAKER_04]: for breast cancer awareness, which is pretty awesome.

176
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:04,405
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two different tournaments they're having.

177
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:07,567
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a single elimination and double team, two versus two.

178
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:13,210
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to check out their forums at cavegirlforums.com, they really go down the list of everything that it is.

179
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can actually donate your entry fee there online.

180
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:17,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty neat there.

181
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:20,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, very creative idea for a good cause.

182
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:24,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I would hope that maybe Microsoft, this will get on their radar.

183
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:25,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it'll be a blip on their radar.

184
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:25,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll

185
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:28,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Advertise it on the site or something.

186
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:30,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it Cave Girls?

187
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:37,248
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just like a cave, G-I-R-L, like a no riot girl, G-R-R thing going on there or whatever.

188
00:12:37,268 --> 00:12:39,189
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

189
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,390
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

190
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:47,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the resident OLR cave girl is going to open up the mailbag right now.

191
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:55,179
[SPEAKER_04]: And you notice how she responded with a very cave girl.

192
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:55,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey!

193
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:57,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make me get out of this club and beat you.

194
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:30,099
[SPEAKER_17]: We have an email from Picaruno.

195
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that how it's pronounced?

196
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe so.

197
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:34,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, all.

198
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:35,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

199
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:39,106
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm writing in to tell you about something I verified this week.

200
00:13:39,406 --> 00:13:45,210
[SPEAKER_17]: So you know that Sony opened the PC version of the PlayStation Store in Japan only for now, right?

201
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,614
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, there's something to slightly dodge you about how they check to see if you're allowed to access it.

202
00:13:51,363 --> 00:14:03,932
[SPEAKER_17]: When I tried to access the store, I managed to see the front page and usage FAQs, but since I tried to click on a game, I got an English message saying PlayStation Store is not available in the selected country or region.

203
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:07,055
[SPEAKER_17]: This is rather odd seeing as, you know, I live in Japan.

204
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:13,659
[SPEAKER_17]: So I took a screenshot showing the error message along with an IP geolocation result.

205
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,021
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on Flickr, but...

206
00:14:18,303 --> 00:14:23,748
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, you might be thinking that since I was using a Mac, the error message was a badly worded way of saying, Use Windows, fool!

207
00:14:24,268 --> 00:14:27,050
[SPEAKER_17]: But no, even on Windows, I get the exact same error.

208
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,734
[SPEAKER_17]: Then Sakurina suggested I try changing my system's language settings to Japanese.

209
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:32,235
[SPEAKER_17]: Lo and behold, it now works.

210
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:36,158
[SPEAKER_17]: There are several reasons why this is retarded.

211
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,462
[SPEAKER_17]: First, regional settings on the machine should make no difference to a website.

212
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:52,027
[SPEAKER_17]: And also to point out something, when the Sarah Jane Adventures was first coming out and they had all the clips of everything on the BBC's website, they actually had it bought by IP, not by your language.

213
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:57,949
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what Sony should have done so that you couldn't see the website outside of the UK.

214
00:14:58,449 --> 00:14:58,750
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyway...

215
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:07,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Second is borderline racist as it implies anyone who doesn't have their computer set to Japanese, i.e.

216
00:15:07,717 --> 00:15:10,018
[SPEAKER_17]: native Japanese people, shouldn't have access to the site.

217
00:15:10,418 --> 00:15:14,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Seriously, I'm a registered resident of Japan and I have a legal right to access the store.

218
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:18,739
[SPEAKER_17]: It's ridiculous that I'm barred because I have my computer set in a language I'm more comfortable with.

219
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:26,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Does this mean that any native Japanese person can access the Japan store from wherever they are in the world just because of their computer's language settings?

220
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:27,481
[SPEAKER_17]: How dare you, Sony?

221
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:29,562
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I would love for you to do is...

222
00:15:32,145 --> 00:15:45,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Change your settings to Japanese, and I don't think that you'd be able to do this given where you live, but I would love to have somebody else anywhere else in the world set their language settings to Japanese and try to order to ship outside of Japan.

223
00:15:47,265 --> 00:15:52,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask, if that's all you have to do, then me living in the U.S., could I just change my language to Japanese and do it?

224
00:15:52,707 --> 00:16:04,251
[SPEAKER_17]: The only other thing I think of, and this is because I've ordered stuff through Japanese websites, is that they actually, the way that the postal system works there, it has it all set by your postal code.

225
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:10,213
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's set by your postal code, what city you live in, and what section of the city you live in.

226
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:15,842
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really, really difficult because it's set so completely different than the U.S.

227
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:20,504
[SPEAKER_17]: system that you're not going to really be able to... If the fields are preloaded that way, then you're not going to be able to do it.

228
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:24,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good luck on your quest, Picoruno.

229
00:16:25,466 --> 00:16:25,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Seriously.

230
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:39,411
[SPEAKER_17]: So, next email up is... You mentioned the orange box in the last episode, and it just occurred to me that I should send you guys my anti-orange box rant from a couple weeks ago.

231
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,411
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

232
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:40,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

233
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:44,149
[SPEAKER_17]: The Rant, Valve and the Orange Box.

234
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:45,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Valve, you suck.

235
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:48,657
[SPEAKER_17]: That shall be the thesis of this rant.

236
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:51,889
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

237
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,467
[SPEAKER_17]: TF2 and Portal.

238
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:22,308
[SPEAKER_17]: They added two games I already own and love into the package, cranked the price up to $50 and forced me to buy them.

239
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:23,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Again.

240
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:24,889
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not pleased by this.

241
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:31,930
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I wouldn't mind this normally, but this is the one way Valve has announced they're selling Half-Life 2 Episode 2.

242
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,591
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is that?

243
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:37,452
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the point where some of you might say that they did this with Half-Life 2's release.

244
00:17:37,992 --> 00:17:39,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I know I have a special edition DVD.

245
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,973
[SPEAKER_17]: The difference is Half-Life 2 completely upgraded the graphics system for its packaged older games.

246
00:17:44,403 --> 00:17:47,926
[SPEAKER_17]: Half-Life and Counter-Strike, now known as Counter-Strike Source and Half-Life Source.

247
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:54,913
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, some of the smart people may be like, wow, a company like Valve couldn't have screwed up the release this much.

248
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, they think they didn't, but they have a solution.

249
00:17:58,536 --> 00:17:58,917
[SPEAKER_17]: Gifting!

250
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Turns out that if I buy the orange box, I can give away Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episode 1 to people.

251
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:07,585
[SPEAKER_17]: What happens to them if they want to buy Half-Life 2 Episode 2?

252
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:09,167
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they going to release it so that you can buy it...

253
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:14,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Episode 2 alone, or are they going to do it launch day, or are they going to make us wait?

254
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:20,552
[SPEAKER_17]: At one point, they were going to have the black box, which didn't have Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, but that was axed.

255
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:24,314
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

256
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:31,119
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll probably break down and dish out the extra cash, because I absolutely adore the series, and let's know what happens next.

257
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:37,383
[SPEAKER_17]: So if anyone wants a free copy of Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, I'll probably post a follow-up regarding if I break down or not.

258
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Either way, Valve has gone out of their way to piss off the core audience in hopes of increasing their gamership.

259
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Well done, Valve.

260
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Well done.

261
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:49,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is from... There's still tons of people excited about this coming out, though.

262
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:50,581
[SPEAKER_17]: That's from Super Al.

263
00:18:52,322 --> 00:19:01,624
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is, you know, nobody ever enjoys those type of, like, bait-and-switch things where it's like, you know, hey, you can get it for this low price, but oh, never mind, we don't want to do that anymore because we thought of a way to make more money out of it.

264
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:03,644
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just capitalism at its finest.

265
00:19:03,944 --> 00:19:04,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, hell yeah.

266
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,105
[SPEAKER_17]: So, the last email, because we didn't get very many.

267
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Greetings, OLR Peoples.

268
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:10,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Greetings.

269
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Ow, my neck hurts.

270
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:13,697
[SPEAKER_17]: This is from Poo Face, by the way.

271
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:16,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that name.

272
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:17,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Poo Face.

273
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:23,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Last week's show you were talking about the Asshole Mario levels on YouTube.

274
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:30,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, there is a download of a file you can use to patch Super Mario World ROM and turn it into the Kaizo Mario World Game, a.k.a.

275
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:30,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Asshole Mario.

276
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,423
[SPEAKER_17]: I downloaded it and played it.

277
00:19:32,824 --> 00:19:37,427
[SPEAKER_17]: I was trying for nearly an hour on just the first part where you have to jump the bullet bills across the enormous jump.

278
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:43,672
[SPEAKER_17]: I still haven't gotten it, and I have no clue how many vulgarities I yelled out while trying to attempt this mass torture device.

279
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:46,054
[SPEAKER_17]: Download it and give it a try if you're feeling brave.

280
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:47,633
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

281
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:08,434
[SPEAKER_04]: But the sad part is... I'm not dumb.

282
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't say that.

283
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:10,915
[SPEAKER_04]: You hurt my feelings.

284
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:12,036
[SPEAKER_17]: We got another email in.

285
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:14,357
[SPEAKER_17]: However, I'm not going to read it because it was fairly rude.

286
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:15,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Save it for next week.

287
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:16,118
[SPEAKER_17]: About one of our listeners, though.

288
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:17,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Save it for next week.

289
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:18,619
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to read it at all.

290
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:19,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, real quick, though.

291
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:28,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say that the sad part about it is I remember playing this game back when it was a part of Mario All-Stars on the Super Nintendo, and I totally beat it.

292
00:20:29,404 --> 00:20:30,084
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

293
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,165
[SPEAKER_04]: It took me like a day to beat it.

294
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:31,925
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

295
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:36,548
[SPEAKER_04]: and now it's like my video game skills have deteriorated with age.

296
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you're getting old, Rob.

297
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:39,652
[SPEAKER_17]: So which is harder, Rob?

298
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,655
[SPEAKER_17]: Who gives you some aspirin to combat the arthritis?

299
00:20:41,835 --> 00:20:42,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

300
00:20:42,757 --> 00:20:46,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is harder, that or the first level of Kid Icarus?

301
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:54,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, seeing as I got to World 2 and Kid Icarus eventually, it's probably that.

302
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Terror, danger, horror.

303
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:00,109
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't even know there was a second level to Kid Icarus.

304
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:02,994
[SPEAKER_14]: I only know the first level song and it's like, wait a minute.

305
00:21:03,717 --> 00:21:04,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you beat the game?

306
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:06,139
[SPEAKER_04]: What about you, smartass?

307
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever get to World 2?

308
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,402
[SPEAKER_14]: I never played Kid Icarus.

309
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:10,022
[SPEAKER_14]: You suck!

310
00:21:10,122 --> 00:21:10,983
[SPEAKER_14]: So no, I didn't.

311
00:21:11,023 --> 00:21:11,844
[SPEAKER_14]: I've beaten Kid Icarus.

312
00:21:12,364 --> 00:21:13,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too, when I was 7.

313
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,446
[SPEAKER_14]: I beat Rygar.

314
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:15,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Or no, I have to have been older than that.

315
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:16,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Rygar is a great game.

316
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:18,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Rygar is great, except for the ending.

317
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:22,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you beat Rygar, that's hardcore, because you could not save or password that game.

318
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:23,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, that shit was hard.

319
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:25,214
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to leave the Nintendo One overnight.

320
00:21:25,294 --> 00:21:26,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, we did, too.

321
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:29,578
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know what else they would buy on at Commando with Hitler's brain blowing up?

322
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:31,698
[SPEAKER_17]: I never beat that game.

323
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:33,659
[SPEAKER_17]: That game was so frickin' hard.

324
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,979
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what game was frickin' hard?

325
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:36,319
[SPEAKER_17]: It was Strider on the NES.

326
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,880
[SPEAKER_14]: It was based off of the Japanese comics.

327
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,080
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to pay tribute to video game endings at some point.

328
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we do.

329
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Good ones.

330
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:49,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Not ones that are like... There actually was a funny YouTube clip, I want to say it showed up on Dig this week, about really bad video game endings.

331
00:21:50,202 --> 00:21:52,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just was a bunch of bad video game endings back to back.

332
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:52,983
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of funny.

333
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:56,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate the ones where it's like you can only get the good ending if you play it in hard mode.

334
00:21:56,544 --> 00:21:57,644
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm thinking, ahhh!

335
00:21:58,996 --> 00:21:59,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Wimp.

336
00:21:59,276 --> 00:21:59,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Wimp.

337
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:06,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well if you would like DarkSakura to read your emails on air, send your emails to mailbag at orangelawnradio.com.

338
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Just keep it clean and don't make them mean.

339
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:09,381
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't like mean emails.

340
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:13,203
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want emails bad-mouthing other listeners, so just drop it.

341
00:22:13,283 --> 00:22:14,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you want to bad-mouth Loki.

342
00:22:14,824 --> 00:22:17,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can... Or Rice Princess.

343
00:22:17,806 --> 00:22:20,267
[SPEAKER_04]: We need some good Rice Princess bashing emails.

344
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:21,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, no.

345
00:22:21,628 --> 00:22:22,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And Eddie bashing emails.

346
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:24,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Eddie's fine, but not me.

347
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:25,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

348
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on with some gaming news.

349
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:36,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, it started out as an April Fool's joke from ThinkGeek, but now, due to popular demand, they have gone ahead and made it.

350
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:38,990
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the 8-bit tie.

351
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:44,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a tie that looks like it's made out of pixels, and you can buy it for yourself for the low, low price of $19.99.

352
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:54,419
[SPEAKER_03]: It's available on their online store, and I guess it's a way to get you some extra nerd cred.

353
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a clip-on, by the way.

354
00:22:58,695 --> 00:23:01,076
[SPEAKER_03]: 8-bit tie.

355
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:02,437
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of nifty.

356
00:23:03,738 --> 00:23:04,158
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

357
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:07,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it looks kind of cool.

358
00:23:09,441 --> 00:23:12,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried.

359
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:18,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be funny to wear it to work one day, just randomly, and have people stare at me going, what is wrong with you?

360
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:19,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they don't already do that.

361
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:21,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, would you guys see it in the studio there?

362
00:23:21,707 --> 00:23:22,127
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

363
00:23:22,427 --> 00:23:23,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you wear that out in public?

364
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:24,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you wear that to the bank?

365
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:27,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to the bank, but yeah, I would actually probably wear that.

366
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're a nerd.

367
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,131
Yep.

368
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:33,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

369
00:23:34,324 --> 00:23:39,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, something else that is not to be seen in public is new levels from the new Simpsons game.

370
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:41,128
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, if you're Rockstar.

371
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:52,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Rockstar has their panties in a bunch because they're upset that the Simpsons game dares to make fun of Grand Theft Auto with its own little Grand Theft scratchy game thing going on.

372
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:59,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, some of the game's content had to be pulled because Rockstar was not happy with the way the license was being used.

373
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:03,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, to be fair, Rockstar's not the only one, apparently, but Rockstar's the only one that's being...

374
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,440
[SPEAKER_04]: called out by name.

375
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently at Leipzig, there was actually a poster at the Games Convention in Germany, right?

376
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:14,882
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a poster with Grand Theft Scratchy that caught Rockstar's eye, and they asked for it to be removed.

377
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:18,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, on the other hand, Harmonix, they thought Sitar Hero was funny.

378
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:20,744
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is... That's great.

379
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:30,506
[SPEAKER_04]: That is being left in the game, apparently, so... So apparently some companies don't... Some people have a sense of humor, some do not.

380
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:31,786
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

381
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:33,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, yeah, probably it's with Apu.

382
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:34,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

383
00:24:34,454 --> 00:24:35,894
[SPEAKER_17]: I know somebody who has an electric sitar.

384
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:40,415
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing is that I, I, I have this feeling, to Rockstar's credit, credit?

385
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:47,457
[SPEAKER_04]: To Rockstar's credit, I have this feeling that it's just one suit who has their feathers ruffled over this.

386
00:24:47,497 --> 00:24:51,418
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just one person whose words have been misconstrued to person versus person.

387
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:53,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I bet most people at Rockstar have a sense of humor.

388
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:55,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sad that one person...

389
00:24:55,492 --> 00:25:01,414
[SPEAKER_04]: probably has made this whole thing get blown out of proportion, but that's what happens when you're an executive and you say something silly.

390
00:25:01,474 --> 00:25:12,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thing, I think that their thing behind it is that it's kind of, I mean, they're making it so that it's very obvious that it's a parody of Grand Theft Auto.

391
00:25:12,358 --> 00:25:22,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Grand Theft Scratchy, they're not doing it like, you know, was it the game that was in the actual Simpsons show, which I don't remember, was like Grand Theft Auto or something, you know,

392
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:26,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what they called it, like Death Hunter or something, whatever.

393
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,412
[SPEAKER_03]: But either way, the fact that it's so similar is why they're probably pissed off.

394
00:25:31,452 --> 00:25:38,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it was a game that you knew was kind of like Grand Theft Auto but didn't actually sound like Grand Theft Auto, they might not be so mad.

395
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:41,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but is it really going to cut into their profits?

396
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:42,317
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

397
00:25:42,337 --> 00:25:43,697
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just whining little pussies.

398
00:25:43,737 --> 00:25:46,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for translating.

399
00:25:46,818 --> 00:25:47,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

400
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:49,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

401
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:57,444
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story before we get into tonight's episode of Match Game, which we promised for this part of RP.

402
00:25:57,804 --> 00:25:58,325
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story.

403
00:25:58,806 --> 00:25:59,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold your applause.

404
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:00,247
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not into Match Game just yet.

405
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:00,948
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one more story.

406
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:02,931
[SPEAKER_13]: We do, don't we?

407
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:08,097
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, more joy for our European buddies.

408
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:11,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Call of Duty 4 is going to have a special edition.

409
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:15,392
[SPEAKER_17]: There was the beta test and all that went on.

410
00:26:15,853 --> 00:26:37,590
[SPEAKER_17]: So what's going to come with the special edition is two and a half hours of SAS footage with the elite soldiers' history and their formation in the Second World War up to modern day conflicts, a making of documentary, a level walkthrough by Infinity Ward, and a hardcover art book with lots of the concept pictures.

411
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:41,765
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyone playing on the PC has to download their strategy guide.

412
00:26:42,805 --> 00:26:44,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will also be available in the United States.

413
00:26:46,268 --> 00:26:46,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool!

414
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Worldwide loving for Call of Duty fans.

415
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,571
[SPEAKER_03]: But only on the Xbox 360.

416
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:55,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, since it is episode number 250, we're going to play one of our very favorite games, the match game.

417
00:26:55,854 --> 00:26:59,076
[SPEAKER_04]: But in order to play the match game, we need to get some contestants.

418
00:26:59,457 --> 00:27:04,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to take, if you would like to play the match game, if you're in our chat room, just type me.

419
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Me.

420
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:05,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Only once.

421
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:07,884
[SPEAKER_04]: If you type me more than once, you're not going to get picked.

422
00:27:07,924 --> 00:27:13,546
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you type me once, then we're going to let Puppy pick our contestant from chat today because he hasn't really talked a lot tonight's episode.

423
00:27:13,707 --> 00:27:13,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

424
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:14,827
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not enough microphones.

425
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:15,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

426
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:18,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, our fourth microphone died, so we only have three microphones we're sharing.

427
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:24,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So Puppy will pick the chat contestant soon, but we also want to get somebody on the telephone.

428
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:29,534
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you would like to give us a call and be our person on the phone to play, give us a call right now.

429
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:34,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio or our telephone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

430
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:36,640
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

431
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,082
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to wait for somebody to call.

432
00:27:40,883 --> 00:27:44,946
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little bit of a delay between when we say something and when people hear it.

433
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:47,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just now seeing all the me's jumping up on the screen.

434
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:49,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, meanwhile, okay, so Puppy sees all the me's.

435
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:52,912
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't you pick somebody who said me only once that gets to play Match Game tonight.

436
00:27:53,052 --> 00:27:53,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to...

437
00:27:54,977 --> 00:27:56,158
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to roll a D20?

438
00:27:56,318 --> 00:27:58,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, actually.

439
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my lord.

440
00:27:59,841 --> 00:28:00,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my lord.

441
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:00,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, hold on.

442
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:01,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

443
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,143
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting a chatter.

444
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:02,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

445
00:28:03,023 --> 00:28:03,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

446
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:04,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

447
00:28:07,487 --> 00:28:08,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you're on... Hi, FootyMonster.

448
00:28:09,128 --> 00:28:09,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, FootyMonster.

449
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:10,329
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

450
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:13,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a bad delay tonight?

451
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:14,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's probably... I'm having fun.

452
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:15,333
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you guys doing?

453
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:16,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

454
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:19,937
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably the Operator 11 webcam causing us a little bit of a delay tonight, so...

455
00:28:20,393 --> 00:28:23,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a feeling we might have to kill Op 11 in order to have a little lag.

456
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:24,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Operator 11.

457
00:28:24,295 --> 00:28:26,957
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to say bye-bye to you guys to kill the lag.

458
00:28:27,757 --> 00:28:31,459
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see you next week here on Operator 11 with more Orange Lounge Radio.

459
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,520
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's okay.

460
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure it's the lag is being caused from Operator 11, so we're just going to end the feed there.

461
00:28:39,504 --> 00:28:40,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you staring at that?

462
00:28:41,565 --> 00:28:41,805
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

463
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:43,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully that will help a little better.

464
00:28:43,926 --> 00:28:45,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear us now, Footy Monster?

465
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:48,247
[SPEAKER_18]: I can hear you, I don't know if I'll do it.

466
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:19,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, if so, you say something in blank and have to figure out what that's supposed to be, right?

467
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:23,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we're going to say something with a blank and you have to figure out what that something is.

468
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:25,490
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make sure you can hear us okay, right?

469
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:27,691
[SPEAKER_19]: I can hear you okay.

470
00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:29,451
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this is a bit late, but I can hear you okay.

471
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:30,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, that's all right.

472
00:29:30,932 --> 00:29:34,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I see Escapist has left chat, so I hope that's not a bad sign.

473
00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:34,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

474
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:35,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure he's still there.

475
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:38,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to play?

476
00:29:39,656 --> 00:29:40,636
[SPEAKER_04]: You left chat.

477
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,289
[SPEAKER_04]: That's never happened before.

478
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:46,269
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a player just leave.

479
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:47,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit, I got picked.

480
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:47,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

481
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bailing.

482
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I scared him off.

483
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Leaving.

484
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:51,971
[SPEAKER_04]: See ya.

485
00:29:55,232 --> 00:29:56,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, I got a private message back.

486
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:57,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops, yep, I'll still be there.

487
00:29:58,032 --> 00:29:58,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

488
00:29:58,412 --> 00:29:59,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, what's over here?

489
00:29:59,072 --> 00:30:01,653
[SPEAKER_04]: This is tonight, Footy Monster vs. Escapist.

490
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:05,614
[SPEAKER_04]: But before we get to it, we need to get some theme music and introduce our celebrities tonight.

491
00:30:11,204 --> 00:30:16,726
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, celebrity number one tonight is the queen of the show who does not put up with shit from anybody.

492
00:30:16,786 --> 00:30:18,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It is DarkSakura.

493
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:19,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

494
00:30:20,126 --> 00:30:20,427
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

495
00:30:21,307 --> 00:30:24,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Celebrity number two tonight is the king of the show.

496
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:26,188
[SPEAKER_04]: It's me.

497
00:30:26,228 --> 00:30:26,628
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

498
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:27,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki is here.

499
00:30:27,949 --> 00:30:28,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Loki.

500
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:29,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here.

501
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:32,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And celebrity number three is...

502
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:38,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, it's me, hi, hello, how you doing?

503
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:42,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to Puppy!

504
00:30:43,476 --> 00:30:44,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

505
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:47,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and Puppy, are you here to plug anything, Puppy?

506
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:51,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Because celebrities on game shows are usually here to plug something.

507
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:56,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally I would plug Baskin Robbins, but I don't work for them anymore, so I don't give a shit.

508
00:30:56,744 --> 00:30:58,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So go eat some Ben & Jerry's this week.

509
00:30:59,145 --> 00:30:59,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Good idea.

510
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,167
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, go get your cakes from Cold Stone.

511
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:01,507
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

512
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:06,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, celebrity number five is Rice Princess.

513
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:08,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello there.

514
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:09,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

515
00:31:09,864 --> 00:31:10,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

516
00:31:10,624 --> 00:31:12,125
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are you here plugging tonight?

517
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:13,946
[SPEAKER_14]: My friends.

518
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:14,887
[SPEAKER_04]: You were about to say.

519
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:17,508
[SPEAKER_14]: La, la, la, la, la.

520
00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:19,530
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you were going to say something else.

521
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,950
[SPEAKER_04]: She sounded like she was going to say her butt.

522
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:22,671
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't say butt.

523
00:31:22,752 --> 00:31:24,272
[SPEAKER_14]: I said my friends.

524
00:31:24,372 --> 00:31:27,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and as Carizzle in chat says, the drag queen of the show.

525
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:28,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

526
00:31:28,535 --> 00:31:29,676
[SPEAKER_04]: That might have been about somebody else.

527
00:31:29,736 --> 00:31:30,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

528
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:31,561
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

529
00:31:31,782 --> 00:31:33,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also joining us, celebrity number six.

530
00:31:34,242 --> 00:31:35,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

531
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:36,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Casper the Gay.

532
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:36,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

533
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:37,123
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?

534
00:31:37,384 --> 00:31:37,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good.

535
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:38,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

536
00:31:38,644 --> 00:31:39,744
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are you here to plug tonight?

537
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be plugging your butt.

538
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:43,646
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

539
00:31:44,066 --> 00:31:45,847
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, it's only porn if you tape it.

540
00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:47,107
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

541
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:49,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Footy Monster, do you have anything to plug tonight?

542
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:51,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

543
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:52,589
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

544
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:53,089
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

545
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:54,010
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get to plug unless you win.

546
00:31:55,635 --> 00:31:56,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there you go.

547
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:57,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I have to exit the chat or anything?

548
00:31:57,276 --> 00:31:57,756
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't have to.

549
00:31:57,776 --> 00:31:58,337
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use them for ideas.

550
00:31:58,357 --> 00:31:58,697
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

551
00:31:58,777 --> 00:31:59,157
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not cheating.

552
00:31:59,177 --> 00:32:00,338
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, escapists can see their answers too.

553
00:32:00,358 --> 00:32:00,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

554
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Question number one.

555
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:25,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie was very excited to hear that Brewfest was going to be celebrated in World of Warcraft.

556
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:30,687
[SPEAKER_04]: However, when she remembered that she cancelled her account, she was sad.

557
00:32:31,388 --> 00:32:33,149
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's okay, she thought to herself.

558
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:37,052
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can blank.

559
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:46,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie was very excited to hear that Brewfest was going to be celebrated in World of Warcraft, but she remembered she canceled her account.

560
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:47,377
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

561
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:50,459
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can blank.

562
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Our celebrities will need to ding when they think of their answer.

563
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:56,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

564
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:57,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

565
00:33:00,803 --> 00:33:01,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Ding, I guess.

566
00:33:02,924 --> 00:33:03,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Bang.

567
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:04,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Bang.

568
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:05,265
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Puppy?

569
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:06,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

570
00:33:06,205 --> 00:33:07,446
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Puppy's going to... All right, here we go.

[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have...

573
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:13,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have an answer, FootyMonster?

574
00:33:15,982 --> 00:33:16,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you thought of one?

575
00:33:18,104 --> 00:33:22,448
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having very bad connections to Argentina tonight.

576
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:23,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you thought of an answer, FootyMonster?

577
00:33:26,612 --> 00:33:27,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I can hear you.

578
00:33:27,312 --> 00:33:27,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here it is.

579
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,694
[SPEAKER_04]: FootyMonster, fill in the blank.

580
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,397
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to celebrate with the Warcraft players, I can...

581
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:56,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance nude with no armor in the middle of Ironforge Dance nude with no armor in the middle of Ironforge Very good answer And Escapist said Gain 50 points and breathe through my mouth I'm sorry I guess I missed something I don't know DarkSakura, what did you answer this?

[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see if there's a match Not play World of Warcraft

583
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:03,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

584
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:04,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match, though.

585
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I go next?

586
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, Rice Princess.

587
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:11,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I can celebrate by... Logging on to my Final Fantasy XI account.

588
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:13,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match, either.

589
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:15,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Casper the Gay, what did you pick?

590

[SPEAKER_07]: Go to the strip club, The Full Murloc.

591
00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:21,513
[SPEAKER_14]: You are an idiot!

592
00:34:22,334 --> 00:34:23,535
[SPEAKER_14]: That's terrible, Ross!

593
00:34:23,575 --> 00:34:28,079
[SPEAKER_04]: The Full Murloc!

594
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:28,979
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the best part.

595
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:29,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

596
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:30,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki...

597
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:34,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I can celebrate by... Just drinking at home.

598
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:38,663
[SPEAKER_17]: How is that any different from any other night?

599
00:34:39,584 --> 00:34:40,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer, but not a hat.

600
00:34:40,464 --> 00:34:42,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you would have a celebratory hat.

601
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Party hats, ooh!

602
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,692
[SPEAKER_17]: That makes drinking more fun.

603
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:51,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy, I'm going to celebrate by...

604
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:53,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Drinking by myself.

605
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:55,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Drinking by myself.

606
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:56,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer, but not a match.

607
00:34:57,248 --> 00:35:05,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, my answer, she's going to participate by cosplaying in nothing but her lederhosen, which also was not a match.

608
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:07,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Isn't that almost like a match with me?

609
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:08,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Dancing dude kind of thing?

610
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:10,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, no.

611
00:35:10,594 --> 00:35:10,694
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

612
00:35:10,994 --> 00:35:11,314
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

613
00:35:11,534 --> 00:35:13,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Yours didn't involve lederhosen.

614
00:35:14,798 --> 00:35:18,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Escapist admits to being a shitty answer, okay?

615
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Escapist meant to say, gain 50 pounds and breathe through my mouth, because that would make her a better Warcraft player, get it?

616
00:35:25,664 --> 00:35:30,167
[SPEAKER_17]: To be... Yeah, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, I have a life.

617
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:32,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey now, wait a minute.

618
00:35:32,408 --> 00:35:32,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I play Ragnarok.

619
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:33,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm level 68.

620
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:50,785
[SPEAKER_04]: at least you don't roleplay that's right, still would not have been a match but I did play on a roleplay server, however I never partied with anyone we were wondering what the fuck Escapist was smoking glad to know everything's okay ready for question number two, everybody are you ready for question number two, FoodieMonster?

621
00:35:51,945 --> 00:36:01,068
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely bring on the pain, here we go question number two Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release

622
00:36:03,686 --> 00:36:04,446
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game, people.

623
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:07,748
[SPEAKER_04]: The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie.

624
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:14,891
[SPEAKER_04]: When Loki came home from work one day wearing the tie, the wife exclaimed, What is that around your neck?

625
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:16,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a blank.

626
00:36:21,394 --> 00:36:24,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release.

627
00:36:24,755 --> 00:36:26,856
[SPEAKER_04]: The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie.

628
00:36:26,896 --> 00:36:30,497
[SPEAKER_04]: When Loki came home from work one day wearing the tie, the wife exclaimed, What is that around your neck?

629
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:31,438
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a blank.

630
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,470
[SPEAKER_04]: NilssonSky, everybody think in here.

631
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, puppies think in here.

632
00:36:40,971 --> 00:36:51,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

633
00:36:51,134 --> 00:36:52,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Footie Monster said ding.

634
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:55,136
[SPEAKER_17]: Ding.

635
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:56,476
[SPEAKER_17]: Dingly ding.

636
00:36:58,917 --> 00:36:59,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a ding.

637
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:01,583
[SPEAKER_13]: You sure do.

638
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:04,985
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't need to know about your ding on the show.

639
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:05,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

640
00:37:05,905 --> 00:37:06,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess.

641
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:08,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ding?

642
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:09,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a ding?

643
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:11,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I do, but do you have a ding?

644
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:13,368
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.

645
00:37:13,388 --> 00:37:15,709
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.

646
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:17,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, I'm actually waiting on Escapist still.

647
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Escapist does not send me a private message with his answer.

648
00:37:20,111 --> 00:37:24,153
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just let the music play while we wait for that answer.

649
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:29,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks in chat are trying to help, giving answers there.

650
00:37:32,392 --> 00:37:32,752
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

651
00:37:33,373 --> 00:37:34,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I just saw the answer.

652
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:34,833
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.

653
00:37:34,873 --> 00:37:35,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, Escapist gives an answer.

654
00:37:36,294 --> 00:37:37,515
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, FootyMonster, you ready?

655
00:37:37,615 --> 00:37:37,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

656
00:37:39,116 --> 00:37:41,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki immediately went and bought the 8-bit tie upon hearing of its release.

657
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:44,739
[SPEAKER_04]: The wife apparently didn't feel so great about the tie.

658
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:48,661
[SPEAKER_04]: When Loki came home from work one day wearing the tie, the wife exclaimed, What is that around your neck?

659
00:37:48,721 --> 00:37:51,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a... Piece of shit.

660
00:37:52,243 --> 00:37:55,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Piece of shit, says FootyMonster.

661
00:37:56,205 --> 00:37:57,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Keeps it very simple.

662
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:58,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Piece of shit.

663
00:37:58,126 --> 00:37:58,466
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

664
00:37:59,763 --> 00:38:01,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and see what the folks in the studio got.

665
00:38:01,924 --> 00:38:02,524
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

666
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:03,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

667
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:03,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops.

668
00:38:03,505 --> 00:38:04,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say Escapist's answer.

669
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:05,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry.

670
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:05,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, say it.

671
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:09,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Escapist said it looks like a ding-a-ling ding-dong.

672
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:12,752
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be a tough one to match.

673
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:13,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, though.

674
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,673
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know with this group.

675
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:15,473
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

676
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:17,155
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, did you put ding-a-ling and ding-dong?

677
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:18,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Something close.

678
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:21,518
[SPEAKER_17]: I said big, blue, stripy, pixelated-looking dildo.

679
00:38:22,078 --> 00:38:24,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, blue, stripy, pixelated-looking dildo.

680
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

681
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:25,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match.

682
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:27,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess, did you ever think of an answer?

683
00:38:28,587 --> 00:38:29,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I said clubbed foot.

684
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:30,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Clubbed foot.

685
00:38:31,949 --> 00:38:33,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer, I think, but not a match.

686
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:34,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Casper the Gay.

687
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a... Stripe of Rice Princess's titty juice.

688
00:38:38,872 --> 00:38:40,853
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

689
00:38:40,873 --> 00:38:41,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

690
00:38:43,714 --> 00:38:44,875
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck?

691
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:47,976
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't make any sense.

692
00:38:48,436 --> 00:38:49,837
[SPEAKER_04]: What is wrong with you?

693
00:38:49,957 --> 00:38:50,737
[SPEAKER_04]: For real?

694
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to ask my boyfriend.

695
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:00,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, okay.

696
00:39:01,098 --> 00:39:03,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, for the love of God, I have a decent answer here.

697
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:04,139
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a?

698
00:39:04,379 --> 00:39:04,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Piece of shit.

699
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:06,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Piece of shit!

700
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Footy Monster gets a point.

701
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding, ding, ding.

702
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray.

703
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,460
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

704
00:39:10,821 --> 00:39:12,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy, it looks like a?

705
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:15,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Dildo by Nintendo.

706
00:39:15,402 --> 00:39:16,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Dildo by Nintendo.

707
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:17,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Dildo would have been a good answer.

708
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:18,662
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

709
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:19,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer, but not a match.

710
00:39:20,243 --> 00:39:25,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And my answer says it looks like a fucking waste of our hard-earned money.

711
00:39:26,084 --> 00:39:26,544
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

712
00:39:27,372 --> 00:39:28,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Way to be realistic.

713
00:39:28,893 --> 00:39:29,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

714
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:31,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what she would really say.

715
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:31,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly.

716
00:39:32,835 --> 00:39:33,115
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

717
00:39:34,256 --> 00:39:35,177
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.

718
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,280
[SPEAKER_04]: You are so stupid.

719
00:39:44,202 --> 00:39:44,562
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

720
00:39:45,403 --> 00:39:47,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready for question number three?

721
00:39:47,044 --> 00:39:48,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to keep up your lead, footy monster?

722
00:39:50,546 --> 00:39:50,966
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to try.

723
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:51,507
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

724
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:53,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And blow Escapist out of the water tonight.

725
00:39:53,828 --> 00:39:55,909
[SPEAKER_04]: But Escapist, you know, try to catch up.

726
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:56,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

727
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:03,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to compliment everybody.

728
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:03,906
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.

729
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:04,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Question number three.

730
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:09,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And our last question tonight, which thankfully has nothing to do with titty juice.

731
00:40:09,649 --> 00:40:11,710
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, question number three.

732
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:17,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob was happy to make amends with Nintendo when he called that poor rep back on Monday.

733
00:40:18,494 --> 00:40:23,637
[SPEAKER_04]: They worked out their differences, and the Nintendo rep said she would send out the Wii cases right away.

734
00:40:24,326 --> 00:40:32,903
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Rob was very surprised and shocked when inside the box from Nintendo, there wasn't any Wii cases, but instead the reps sent him some blanks.

735
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:38,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

736
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:38,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

737
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:38,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

738
00:40:38,706 --> 00:40:39,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding of the century.

739
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Steaming piles of crap?

740
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:06,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Dried Yoshi crap.

741
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:42,968
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is wrong with our country tonight?

742
00:41:43,348 --> 00:41:43,708
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

743
00:41:43,888 --> 00:41:44,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And Argentina.

744
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:45,849
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

745
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:49,650
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

746
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of the Wii cases, the rep sent him some... Tube of Lube.

747
00:41:54,571 --> 00:41:55,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Tube of Lube.

748
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:56,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

749
00:41:56,732 --> 00:41:57,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match.

750
00:41:57,172 --> 00:41:57,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess.

751
00:41:58,453 --> 00:42:01,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of the cases, the rep sent him some... Tact.

752
00:42:02,374 --> 00:42:02,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Tact.

753
00:42:04,614 --> 00:42:05,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match.

754
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:07,155
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

755
00:42:07,355 --> 00:42:09,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Eddie, the rep sent him some...

756
00:42:11,055 --> 00:42:11,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Titty Juice.

757
00:42:12,577 --> 00:42:13,598
[SPEAKER_04]: How did I know that was coming?

758
00:42:13,918 --> 00:42:14,839
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny the first time.

759
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and Escapist will like to remind us he's Canadian.

760
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:18,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm sorry.

761
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:20,625
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong with three different countries tonight, apparently?

762
00:42:20,645 --> 00:42:20,905
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

763
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:22,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

764
00:42:22,727 --> 00:42:23,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Doody!

765
00:42:23,648 --> 00:42:24,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Doody!

766
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Doody, that's a match with Footy Monster.

767
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:28,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Footy Monster gets another point.

768
00:42:28,293 --> 00:42:29,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, Footy Monster.

769
00:42:29,334 --> 00:42:29,634
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

770
00:42:31,276 --> 00:42:31,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy.

771
00:42:32,277 --> 00:42:33,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo rep sent him some.

772
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:35,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Ribbed condoms.

773
00:42:35,945 --> 00:42:37,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Ribbed condoms.

774
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:38,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match.

775
00:42:38,228 --> 00:42:38,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer, though.

776
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:44,415
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, my answer, the rep sent him a bowel movement.

777
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:50,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone had the nerve to send me a bowel movement, and they shall pay for this crime.

778
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:52,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch Pink Flamingo sometime.

779
00:42:53,644 --> 00:42:55,046
[SPEAKER_04]: The couch has rejected me.

780
00:42:55,446 --> 00:42:55,806
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

781
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:56,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

782
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:58,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Another match for Footy Monster.

783
00:42:58,629 --> 00:42:59,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Footy Monster.

784
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Argentina beats Canada 3-0 tonight.

785
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:03,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

786
00:43:03,354 --> 00:43:04,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool!

787
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:07,018
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, Escapist.

788
00:43:07,438 --> 00:43:08,319
[SPEAKER_04]: We still love you.

789
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:09,480
[SPEAKER_04]: We love Canada.

790
00:43:09,861 --> 00:43:11,442
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, you did not win tonight.

791
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy our lovely partying gift.

792
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:15,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Our lovely partying gift tonight.

793
00:43:15,286 --> 00:43:16,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of Rice Princess's...

794
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:18,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Love and affection.

795
00:43:18,522 --> 00:43:19,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Love and affection.

796
00:43:19,142 --> 00:43:20,623
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you think I was going to say, perverts?

797
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:21,243
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

798
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Foodie Monster, you win.

799
00:43:24,124 --> 00:43:25,265
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to plug something.

800
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:25,945
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you want to plug?

801
00:43:27,426 --> 00:43:34,089
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to plug the Ultimate Quest, the RPG podcast that's also on ultimatequest.net and allgames.com.

802
00:43:34,649 --> 00:43:38,911
[SPEAKER_19]: And you can listen to it on Wednesdays at noon Pacific or 3 p.m.

803
00:43:39,031 --> 00:43:39,711
[SPEAKER_19]: Eastern time.

804
00:43:40,031 --> 00:43:41,692
[SPEAKER_19]: And, yeah, check it out if you haven't yet.

805
00:43:42,785 --> 00:43:46,226
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, the Ultimate Quest, the ultimate podcast about role-playing games.

806
00:43:46,326 --> 00:43:48,866
[SPEAKER_04]: They certainly are more educated on role-playing games than we could ever be.

807
00:43:48,987 --> 00:43:53,208
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out on all games on Wednesdays or their site, ultimatequest.net.

808
00:43:53,328 --> 00:43:53,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

809
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, Footy Monster.

810
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:55,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

811
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:57,589
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

812
00:43:57,609 --> 00:43:58,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me on.

813
00:43:58,489 --> 00:43:58,929
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

814
00:43:58,989 --> 00:43:59,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're going to let you go.

815
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:01,249
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

816
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:02,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

817
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:02,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, Footy Monster.

818
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:04,270
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

819
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,431
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a fun match game tonight, even if it was a little bit random.

820
00:44:10,134 --> 00:44:11,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Spy Game Elevator Mission

821
00:44:38,681 --> 00:44:41,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's a crappy looking gun game.

822
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:42,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray!

823
00:44:42,863 --> 00:44:47,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had some screenshots on this ds-x2.com site.

824
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:50,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, does it look like shit.

825
00:44:51,006 --> 00:44:54,648
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, I don't know.

826
00:44:55,428 --> 00:44:59,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I only hope that that's just the DS screenshots, although I think it's only for the Wii.

827
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,831
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those are Wii screenshots, so.

828
00:45:04,192 --> 00:45:05,853
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those games I don't recommend buying.

829
00:45:05,893 --> 00:45:09,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's coming out at the end of October for like $29.99.

830
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:14,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not worth $29.99, but hey, find it used.

831
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:15,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Rent it if you really want to.

832
00:45:16,737 --> 00:45:17,657
[SPEAKER_04]: It might not be that bad.

833
00:45:18,778 --> 00:45:19,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, it might be that bad.

834
00:45:19,618 --> 00:45:20,699
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it looks really bad.

835
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:22,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll post some screens in the chat.

836
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,861
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have made it a sequel to Leisure Larry, like Elevator Mission.

837
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:29,202
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean Leisure Suit Larry?

838
00:45:29,222 --> 00:45:29,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, whatever.

839
00:45:31,443 --> 00:45:31,743
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

840
00:45:32,651 --> 00:45:34,052
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

841
00:46:03,286 --> 00:46:16,169
[SPEAKER_04]: However, community leader Brian Gerrard has revealed that Bungie is at work on another Halo game.

842
00:46:16,689 --> 00:46:20,830
[SPEAKER_04]: It is based on the Halo universe and is a collaboration between Bungie and Peter Jackson.

843
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:22,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that Halo Wars?

844
00:46:22,731 --> 00:46:25,931
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but that announcement's been out for a while now.

845
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:28,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that announcement was out there for a while, but it's not Halo 4.

846
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,295
[SPEAKER_05]: and some other Halo Universe projects.

847
00:46:32,335 --> 00:46:33,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that announcement was already out there.

848
00:46:33,656 --> 00:46:37,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was supposed to be like a movie or a game based on the supposed movie that they were going to do.

849
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:39,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

850
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:39,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

851
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:40,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

852
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And, yeah.

853
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:48,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently, though, if they do want to make a Pimps at Sea game, though, they do still have the ability to make that.

854
00:46:48,585 --> 00:46:56,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the codename for Halo when it was being developed was Pimps at Sea, which actually is a game I would want to play.

855
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:57,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

856
00:46:58,571 --> 00:46:58,811
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

857
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:08,373
[SPEAKER_17]: So, for anyone who wanted the Halo movie, sucks to be you.

858
00:47:09,113 --> 00:47:09,853
[SPEAKER_17]: It's dead.

859
00:47:10,113 --> 00:47:11,094
[SPEAKER_17]: It ain't happening.

860
00:47:11,814 --> 00:47:13,094
[SPEAKER_17]: You've been shafted.

861
00:47:14,635 --> 00:47:15,155
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

862
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:21,537
[SPEAKER_17]: For the bits that were on TV, they had nothing to do with the supposed movie.

863
00:47:22,497 --> 00:47:27,519
[SPEAKER_17]: And, in fact, the powers that be are quoted saying,

864
00:47:28,052 --> 00:47:30,332
[SPEAKER_17]: The film is entirely dead.

865
00:47:31,193 --> 00:47:37,034
[SPEAKER_17]: And the configuration it was in, whatever happens with that movie, assuming the movie gets made, will be a totally different configuration.

866
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:41,674
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not so much me as the entire vessel sank.

867
00:47:42,114 --> 00:47:49,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically, it was a combination of, and there were two studios involved that weren't getting along in the process of making it, Universal and Fox.

868
00:47:50,356 --> 00:47:51,896
[SPEAKER_17]: So guess what sucks?

869
00:47:52,676 --> 00:47:56,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if they're not going to make it, I'll buy that Warthog that they made for the...

870
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather they cancel the movie than make one that bastardizes the entire series, to be honest.

871
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:09,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can all agree on that.

872
00:48:09,102 --> 00:48:14,224
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably for the best that they cancel the movie as opposed to making one that will completely give the series a bad name.

873
00:48:14,544 --> 00:48:20,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I'm wondering, if the World of Warcraft movie is really based on the Alliance, maybe it should be Mercy Killed 2.

874
00:48:20,347 --> 00:48:20,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

875
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:31,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Pimps at Sea was a fake joke project that Bungie announced, but I thought at one point during the alpha process people were seeing on Xbox Live playing Pimps at Sea, so I think it was a little more than just a fake project.

876
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:31,241
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

877
00:48:47,272 --> 00:49:06,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it started off, it was basically, they were seeing, playing Pimps at Sea, which was, you know, the codename for Halo, and then for April Fool's Day, they created a poster or box art or teaser for Pimps at Sea, which featured a parrot with a pirate hook head, which is pretty funny, actually.

878
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:09,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I would go back to playing Puzzle Pirates if it had that theme going on.

879
00:49:11,758 --> 00:49:15,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, actually I'm considering going back to it after not having played it for years.

880
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:18,323
[SPEAKER_04]: You played Puzzle Pirates about as long as I played Final Fantasy XI, huh?

881
00:49:18,863 --> 00:49:20,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it for about at least two years.

882
00:49:21,085 --> 00:49:21,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

883
00:49:22,286 --> 00:49:23,066
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hardcore.

884
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,047
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's still going, huh?

885
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:24,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's still going.

886
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:34,254
[SPEAKER_05]: They just, like in the last month and a half or so, released a couple of new big features that actually have made the game even more successful.

887
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:37,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And Three Rings is rolling in dough.

888
00:49:38,637 --> 00:49:40,519
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have the coolest fucking office ever.

889
00:49:42,751 --> 00:50:11,689
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt says if he could cast the Halo movie he might cast Horatio Sanz as Master Chief I think that might be a sure recipe for disaster I think that's no I think that's more maybe why the movie got cancelled who knows ShadowNextGen says with the success of Halo 3 I find it hard to believe there won't be a Halo movie there's too much money to be made yeah but they can make even more by just making Halo 4 yeah but you know it would be nice if they made a movie to fill in all the plot holes between the games yeah

890
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more like a plot dashed line.

891
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:23,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And Cortana can just randomly interrupt the movie going like, Save me, Master Chief.

892
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:25,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't people play it for the multi-mode?

893
00:50:25,747 --> 00:50:27,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it really about the actual game?

894
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:32,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, look at all the advertisements that they did.

895
00:50:32,432 --> 00:50:35,835
[SPEAKER_05]: They went through that whole process of like, Oh, humanity's last hope is Master Chief.

896
00:50:35,935 --> 00:50:36,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe!

897
00:50:36,636 --> 00:50:39,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And those commercials had nothing to do with the game.

898
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all know that if the Halo movie gets cast, I am bidding for the role of Donut.

899
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:46,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's all I have to say.

900
00:50:49,142 --> 00:50:50,243
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to watch Red vs. Blue.

901
00:50:50,263 --> 00:50:50,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

902
00:50:51,403 --> 00:50:52,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

903
00:50:52,203 --> 00:50:54,964
[SPEAKER_16]: I love Donut.

904
00:50:56,045 --> 00:50:58,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Donuts, too.

905
00:50:59,146 --> 00:51:02,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Just go on YouTube and look up Red vs. Blue and Donut.

906
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:06,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just go to RoosterTeeth.com

907
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:09,030
[SPEAKER_03]: and view them all there.

908
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:10,931
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not pink, it's lightish red.

909
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:19,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can watch all the episodes on Xbox Live Video Marketplace or... Escapist says, I think there's a comic series coming out that fills in the hole between Halo 2 and 3.

910
00:51:21,053 --> 00:51:22,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck that, I ain't reading for shit.

911
00:51:23,573 --> 00:51:24,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did they make me read?

912
00:51:25,274 --> 00:51:32,275
[SPEAKER_04]: And GS68 is basically saying that I can play Tingle but only, quote, as long as Loki is a Covenant alien in a Tingle costume.

913
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:34,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Tingle from Zelda.

914
00:51:44,489 --> 00:51:46,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And then set the Eye of Judgment on fire.

915
00:52:13,948 --> 00:52:15,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Why has this not happened yet?

916
00:52:15,649 --> 00:52:18,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the Eye of Judgment has to sell a million units first.

917
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:18,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, we should still do it anyway.

918
00:52:19,252 --> 00:52:22,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It did, it did.

919
00:52:22,574 --> 00:52:29,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, we need to convince Joystick or Kotaku or something to run the story as a lie, just so we can say, look, it happened.

920
00:52:29,538 --> 00:52:32,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do you even find a Tingle costume, I mean?

921
00:52:33,161 --> 00:52:35,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, get a green leotard and a pair of red Tingle loose?

922
00:52:35,382 --> 00:52:37,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess will have to get out her sewing kit.

923
00:52:37,724 --> 00:52:39,105
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, Rob...

924
00:52:39,736 --> 00:52:46,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know, I do get monthly sales numbers, you know, of each title individually.

925
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,922
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can tell if they've sold a million units or not.

926
00:52:52,064 --> 00:52:52,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, shit.

927
00:52:55,025 --> 00:52:55,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Debbie Downer.

928
00:52:57,867 --> 00:53:01,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Or he can just, you know, change the numbers if it actually does sell over a million.

929
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:03,851
[SPEAKER_05]: He can say he has proof.

930
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:05,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll see.

931
00:53:05,652 --> 00:53:07,233
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, okay, moving on.

932
00:53:07,253 --> 00:53:08,794
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, it'll never sell a million units.

933
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:15,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so there's a lot of Command & Conquer going around apparently.

934
00:53:16,817 --> 00:53:25,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Electronic Arts announced this week that they'll release a Command & Conquer Saga, which is a compilation of 13 games in the series.

935
00:53:26,744 --> 00:53:37,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Included in it will be the original Command & Conquer, Command & Conquer The Covert Operations, Command & Conquer Red Alert, Command & Conquer Red Alert Counter-Strike, Command & Conquer Red Alert The Aftermath,

936
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:55,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Command & Conquer Tyberian Sun, Command & Conquer Tyberian Sun Firestorm, Command & Conquer Red Alert 2, Command & Conquer Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge, Command & Conquer Renegade, Command & Conquer Generals, Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour, and finally Command & Conquer 3, The Tyberian Wars.

937
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:57,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, where do you have time to play all that?

938
00:53:57,654 --> 00:53:59,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will be coming out later this month for $50.

939
00:53:59,636 --> 00:53:59,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, for...

940
00:54:06,101 --> 00:54:09,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess, do not say things unless you're going to say them in a microphone because that joke is lost forever.

941
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:10,567
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

942
00:54:10,607 --> 00:54:10,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Boo.

943
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:15,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, really quickly, I want to mention this MMO, which is something I'm looking forward to.

944
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:20,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sci-fi-based MMO, and it's by Richard Garriott, who, of course, was the guy behind Ultima.

945
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:21,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultima.

946
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:26,004
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

947
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:43,200
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently there was a post on the game's official website.

948
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:47,663
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is having some stability and balance issues, so it's going to be in beta for just two more weeks.

949
00:54:47,943 --> 00:54:51,645
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sci-fi based MMO that looks like it could be kind of fun, so I'm going to check it out.

950
00:54:52,246 --> 00:54:53,747
[SPEAKER_07]: And the main character is Tank Girl?

951
00:54:53,847 --> 00:54:54,047
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

952
00:54:55,027 --> 00:54:56,208
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, Tank Girl is awesome.

953
00:54:56,248 --> 00:54:56,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Kinda.

954
00:54:57,048 --> 00:54:57,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

955
00:54:57,709 --> 00:54:59,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can customize your character.

956
00:54:59,070 --> 00:54:59,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I can show you.

957
00:55:00,683 --> 00:55:02,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to describe how the game looks.

958
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:07,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at a trailer earlier today, and it looks like, I don't know, like Phantasy Star Online meets Mech Warriors or something.

959
00:55:07,285 --> 00:55:08,085
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of crazy.

960
00:55:08,445 --> 00:55:09,185
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks like fun.

961
00:55:09,745 --> 00:55:10,486
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to check.

962
00:55:10,526 --> 00:55:12,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to try a good sci-fi MMO.

963
00:55:12,886 --> 00:55:13,306
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

964
00:55:13,787 --> 00:55:15,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So you said they're working on balance issues?

965
00:55:15,947 --> 00:55:16,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

966
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:19,188
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean there's actually MMO companies that care about that?

967
00:55:20,128 --> 00:55:20,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently.

968
00:55:20,808 --> 00:55:21,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

969
00:55:22,849 --> 00:55:24,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Lord knows there haven't been enough class changes in WoW.

970
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:29,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, the good thing about MMOs is that they can keep changing it if it ain't broke.

971
00:55:30,834 --> 00:55:31,495
[SPEAKER_04]: or if it is broke.

972
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard likes to break things a lot anyway.

973
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently I'm broken and I need to be changed.

974
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,061
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's broke, break it more.

975
00:55:39,342 --> 00:55:40,083
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way you do it.

976
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:42,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's finish up the gaming news so we can get calls and end the show already.

977
00:55:43,286 --> 00:55:45,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Nintendo is giving us a little love.

978
00:55:45,368 --> 00:55:48,410
[SPEAKER_17]: They're offering a Zelda feather stylus.

979
00:55:49,551 --> 00:55:50,072
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

980
00:55:50,152 --> 00:55:50,492
[SPEAKER_17]: See?

981
00:55:50,632 --> 00:55:51,153
[SPEAKER_09]: A feather?

982
00:55:54,036 --> 00:55:56,518
[SPEAKER_17]: It's this transparent feather-shaped plastic thing.

983
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:00,152
[SPEAKER_17]: And that puts the nail in the coffin on those stories All right

984
00:56:23,288 --> 00:56:26,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to be getting to the Skype line very soon.

985
00:56:26,629 --> 00:56:29,030
[SPEAKER_04]: But one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.

986
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:35,993
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

987
00:56:36,053 --> 00:56:38,954
[SPEAKER_04]: So we look forward to hearing your calls very soon.

988
00:56:38,994 --> 00:56:39,894
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, one more story.

989
00:56:41,595 --> 00:56:49,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, unfortunately, I guess Rockstar is going to be giving out a Manhunt 2 themed Wii.

990
00:56:49,438 --> 00:56:52,279
[SPEAKER_03]: What's disappointing about the whole thing is the whole artwork is...

991
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:53,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Airbrush Airbrush

992
00:57:13,854 --> 00:57:15,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they'll just have a lady on her period sit on it?

993
00:57:15,436 --> 00:57:16,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god!

994
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:41,510
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like having Extifer on the show again.

995
00:57:41,751 --> 00:57:42,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, totally.

996
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:44,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Skyblind is open.

997
00:57:44,772 --> 00:57:45,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a call.

998
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:47,314
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

999
00:57:47,434 --> 00:57:48,415
[SPEAKER_04]: The calls are already coming in.

1000
00:57:48,755 --> 00:57:49,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1001
00:57:49,876 --> 00:57:50,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1002
00:57:51,317 --> 00:57:52,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, it's Ranma.

1003
00:57:52,077 --> 00:57:52,718
[SPEAKER_12]: What's up, everyone?

1004
00:57:52,818 --> 00:57:54,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Ranma.

1005
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:55,419
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

1006
00:57:55,459 --> 00:57:56,000
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

1007
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:57,861
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing good.

1008
00:57:57,901 --> 00:58:00,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm recovering from yet another convention I went to this weekend.

1009
00:58:01,463 --> 00:58:02,784
[SPEAKER_04]: What convention did you go to this weekend?

1010
00:58:04,036 --> 00:58:12,681
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Manga Next, a smaller, low-key convention geared towards Japanese comics and panels and cool stuff like that.

1011
00:58:13,021 --> 00:58:14,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And really quickly, sum us up for the con.

1012
00:58:14,683 --> 00:58:15,423
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the highlights?

1013
00:58:18,045 --> 00:58:27,450
[SPEAKER_12]: The 18-plus stuff, like 18-plus Yaoi, Yuri, dating game, the 18-plus match game that I ran, and cosplay chess.

1014
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:28,651
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1015
00:58:28,691 --> 00:58:31,893
[SPEAKER_04]: You asked us if you could steal the match game from us to play at the con, huh?

1016
00:58:32,836 --> 00:58:33,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

1017
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:35,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, dude, it's a Mark Goodson production.

1018
00:58:35,898 --> 00:58:38,899
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really our idea, so you'd rip it off just like we would.

1019
00:58:38,959 --> 00:58:39,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

1020
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,600
[SPEAKER_12]: That's okay.

1021
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:47,283
[SPEAKER_12]: We recorded the whole thing, so I'm going to try to dump it to DVD, so I'll send you guys a copy of it and see how lewd and raunchy we got.

1022
00:58:47,904 --> 00:58:48,184
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1023
00:58:48,244 --> 00:58:48,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

1024
00:58:48,944 --> 00:58:50,425
[SPEAKER_04]: So what else is going on in your gaming world?

1025
00:58:52,526 --> 00:58:53,306
[SPEAKER_12]: Not too much.

1026
00:58:54,307 --> 00:59:00,130
[SPEAKER_12]: From listening from last week, I figured I would call in and get a much better review of Digital Life.

1027
00:59:01,874 --> 00:59:05,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I swear to God, if we get into the DDR contest, this is going to be a short call.

1028
00:59:06,756 --> 00:59:09,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I wasn't even there for that.

1029
00:59:10,316 --> 00:59:11,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank God.

1030
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:12,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so then what was your review of Digital Life?

1031
00:59:14,638 --> 00:59:18,579
[SPEAKER_12]: The rate between a scale from 1 to 10, I'd have to give it a 6.5.

1032
00:59:19,399 --> 00:59:22,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I've gone to 3 out of 4 past Digital Life.

1033
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Last year, it was bad.

1034
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:32,372
[SPEAKER_12]: in terms of there's more vendors, there's more companies, more distributors showing off newer products and selling cool stuff.

1035
00:59:32,413 --> 00:59:35,954
[SPEAKER_12]: This year, it was like as if they really couldn't get too much of anything.

1036
00:59:36,834 --> 00:59:43,356
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, last year, GameCap was having a Street Fighter 3 tournament giving out a lot of cool stuff.

1037
00:59:43,796 --> 00:59:48,198
[SPEAKER_12]: You had Guitar Hero 2, Justice League Heroes, a bunch of other cool games.

1038
00:59:48,878 --> 00:59:52,039
[SPEAKER_12]: And you had like two different sets of pro gaming tournaments going on.

1039
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:58,334
[SPEAKER_12]: This year, the big things were the Namco display, even though it was the same one from last year.

1040
00:59:59,755 --> 01:00:01,936
[SPEAKER_12]: They were there, you know, it was just a little bit bigger.

1041
01:00:02,537 --> 01:00:04,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Best Buy and Geek Squad were there.

1042
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:10,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Intel showed up, they had, I think it was Global Gaming League out there this year with Dell.

1043
01:00:11,163 --> 01:00:17,087
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you know any famous people that are handing out autographs, they have like a gamers lounge with the PMS clan.

1044
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:22,148
[SPEAKER_12]: and then like a little kid section for the kids to play games and stuff.

1045
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:25,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think things got downgraded this year?

1046
01:00:26,812 --> 01:00:27,792
[SPEAKER_12]: That I don't know.

1047
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:34,737
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't make any sense because when I got there, I got there Friday after work for about an hour or some change.

1048
01:00:35,117 --> 01:00:42,823
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm expected to be packed full of people, full of vendors and exhibits and I didn't see it, you know?

1049
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:48,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there's any correlation to the downsizing of E3 causing this?

1050
01:00:49,856 --> 01:01:01,567
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no idea because honestly what Digital Life is is more of an expo on the latest digital innovations and technologies and some cool games that are coming out this year.

1051
01:01:03,588 --> 01:01:09,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe what I think it was so many people went last year thinking it was going to be all of this and they figured it wasn't going to be so.

1052
01:01:10,294 --> 01:01:10,935
[SPEAKER_12]: But the thing was

1053
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:22,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Almost everybody there got in for free because if you knew the proper code, which almost everybody knew, you'd save yourself about $7 for entrance for four straight days.

1054
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:32,677
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so if you could give, just to kind of wrap things up here so we can get some more calls, if you had any piece of advice to give the digital life planners for next year's show, what would you say?

1055
01:01:32,697 --> 01:01:32,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1056
01:01:36,024 --> 01:01:37,384
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep the same people you got here.

1057
01:01:37,445 --> 01:01:38,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Get some newer people.

1058
01:01:38,705 --> 01:01:41,726
[SPEAKER_12]: If you really want to expand more into the game, get more companies in there.

1059
01:01:42,606 --> 01:01:44,327
[SPEAKER_12]: More free swag, definitely.

1060
01:01:45,187 --> 01:01:46,368
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, more free swag.

1061
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:47,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Free is always a good thing.

1062
01:01:47,908 --> 01:01:48,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Free stuff is always a good thing.

1063
01:01:48,848 --> 01:01:49,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, definitely.

1064
01:01:49,609 --> 01:01:49,829
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1065
01:01:50,009 --> 01:01:52,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Ranma, thanks so much for the call.

1066
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:55,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Any last-minute words you want to give our folks here?

1067
01:01:57,071 --> 01:01:57,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you, Irene.

1068
01:01:58,712 --> 01:02:00,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I love you too, Ranma.

1069
01:02:01,253 --> 01:02:01,553
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1070
01:02:02,573 --> 01:02:03,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, Ranma.

1071
01:02:03,153 --> 01:02:03,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

1072
01:02:03,874 --> 01:02:04,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Come back out here and see us.

1073
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:06,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I will, I promise.

1074
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, you better.

1075
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:08,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1076
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:11,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a call.

1077
01:02:11,371 --> 01:02:15,013
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1078
01:02:15,033 --> 01:02:15,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones.

1079
01:02:16,373 --> 01:02:17,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1080
01:02:17,473 --> 01:02:17,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1081
01:02:19,834 --> 01:02:21,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Hola, como estas?

1082
01:02:22,115 --> 01:02:23,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Extifer.

1083
01:02:25,436 --> 01:02:26,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Extifer.

1084
01:02:26,477 --> 01:02:26,937
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1085
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,137
[SPEAKER_14]: We were just talking about you.

1086
01:02:28,157 --> 01:02:29,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, your ears must have been burning.

1087
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:31,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?

1088
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:32,319
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I didn't hear.

1089
01:02:32,399 --> 01:02:33,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't been listening.

1090
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been watching...

1091
01:02:39,624 --> 01:02:41,085
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you know to call us?

1092
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:50,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I got a text from Myrene saying you guys are taking calls.

1093
01:02:50,332 --> 01:02:54,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, is there anything you would like to share that's gaming-oriented with your week?

1094
01:02:57,477 --> 01:02:57,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1095
01:02:58,298 --> 01:03:02,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Puzzle Quest and WoW still.

1096
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:03,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Christopher, guess what?

1097
01:03:04,266 --> 01:03:10,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Did Annie tell you that I'm moving my orc from Elder Thalys, my 38, to Ravencrest?

1098
01:03:11,692 --> 01:03:12,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1099
01:03:12,112 --> 01:03:12,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1100
01:03:12,532 --> 01:03:13,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my goodness.

1101
01:03:13,433 --> 01:03:15,595
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm actually going to play on that server now.

1102
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:19,518
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome news.

1103
01:03:19,678 --> 01:03:20,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Christopher, it's Eddie the Gay.

1104
01:03:21,419 --> 01:03:22,500
[SPEAKER_07]: How's your iPhone doing?

1105
01:03:24,382 --> 01:03:27,744
[SPEAKER_09]: My iPhone is doing absolutely wonderful.

1106
01:03:27,924 --> 01:03:29,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for asking.

1107
01:03:30,066 --> 01:03:30,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss it a lot.

1108
01:03:32,128 --> 01:03:32,468
[SPEAKER_09]: You do?

1109
01:03:33,755 --> 01:03:35,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm Eddie and I do.

1110
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:38,196
[SPEAKER_17]: This hasn't raked yet like everybody else's.

1111
01:03:39,356 --> 01:03:40,597
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell happened to this show?

1112
01:03:40,777 --> 01:03:43,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like our 250th fucking episode, for God's sake.

1113
01:03:44,058 --> 01:03:46,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I always derail the show.

1114
01:03:46,998 --> 01:03:48,599
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my power.

1115
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:49,659
[SPEAKER_17]: It's your mutant power.

1116
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:51,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, XFR, say titty juice.

1117
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,000
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1118
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:54,520
[SPEAKER_17]: Titty juice?

1119
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:54,620
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

1120
01:03:58,345 --> 01:04:00,266
[SPEAKER_17]: At least he didn't talk about bleached assholes.

1121
01:04:00,286 --> 01:04:05,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear that Puzzle Quest is supposed to be the next week's release on Xbox Live Arcade?

1122
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,189
[SPEAKER_09]: That's nice.

1123
01:04:07,229 --> 01:04:08,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still playing it on my DS.

1124
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you give Puzzle Quest on Xbox Live a try?

1125
01:04:11,971 --> 01:04:12,611
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not.

1126
01:04:12,671 --> 01:04:14,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Christopher and I will not.

1127
01:04:15,512 --> 01:04:16,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1128
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:17,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's stupid.

1129
01:04:17,533 --> 01:04:19,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have an Xbox 360.

1130
01:04:20,534 --> 01:04:20,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Silly.

1131
01:04:21,234 --> 01:04:22,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what if you had one?

1132
01:04:22,515 --> 01:04:23,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's imagine you had one.

1133
01:04:23,475 --> 01:04:25,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you pay the $15 to download it?

1134
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,277
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my hands would fall off.

1135
01:04:26,377 --> 01:04:26,577
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1136
01:04:28,873 --> 01:04:30,815
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your problem, Rice Princess?

1137
01:04:31,196 --> 01:04:33,318
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Xtofer.

1138
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:34,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Xtofer.

1139
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:35,320
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your problem?

1140
01:04:36,381 --> 01:04:36,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360.

1141
01:04:37,042 --> 01:04:40,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, so what were you guys saying about me before I called?

1142
01:04:41,266 --> 01:04:43,068
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something about how you derail the show.

1143
01:04:43,148 --> 01:04:43,829
[SPEAKER_04]: And look!

1144
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:45,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Look what happened.

1145
01:04:46,355 --> 01:04:47,716
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, look at me.

1146
01:04:50,217 --> 01:04:59,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to take a moment and let everybody know that you guys need to think about me in the next two hours, because I might find out if I get a promotion at work.

1147
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:06,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that has nothing to do with video games, but think of me while you're playing your video games.

1148
01:05:06,105 --> 01:05:07,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it does, because you're going to level up at work.

1149
01:05:08,746 --> 01:05:09,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Grats.

1150
01:05:09,787 --> 01:05:10,267
[SPEAKER_09]: I will.

1151
01:05:10,647 --> 01:05:11,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I will level up at work.

1152
01:05:11,928 --> 01:05:12,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be part of

1153
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:14,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Infinity to Pwnage, man.

1154
01:05:15,727 --> 01:05:16,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, man.

1155
01:05:18,487 --> 01:05:23,688
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter what win or lose on the job thing, we're still going to go to Disneyland in a couple weeks and celebrate, right?

1156
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:25,649
[SPEAKER_14]: What does it have to do with video games, Rob?

1157
01:05:25,729 --> 01:05:31,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, because, this is what it has to do with video games, because we're going to Disneyland and we're going to be in L.A.

1158
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:34,151
[SPEAKER_04]: at the same time E for All is going on, but we're not going to E for All.

1159
01:05:34,171 --> 01:05:38,572
[SPEAKER_17]: By the way, by the way, a moment of silence from my premium annual pass, which expired today.

1160
01:05:40,782 --> 01:05:44,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you know that you could play WoW at Disneyland for $6 an hour?

1161
01:05:44,443 --> 01:05:45,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I do that?

1162
01:05:45,604 --> 01:05:45,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1163
01:05:46,144 --> 01:05:48,806
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't say you were going to, but you have the ability to.

1164
01:05:48,826 --> 01:05:49,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1165
01:05:49,106 --> 01:05:49,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is that?

1166
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:51,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's kind of a novelty thing.

1167
01:05:51,607 --> 01:05:52,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Why would you want to know?

1168
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:53,428
[SPEAKER_14]: You wouldn't do that.

1169
01:05:53,448 --> 01:05:53,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious.

1170
01:05:53,848 --> 01:05:55,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take pictures of people who do.

1171
01:05:55,049 --> 01:05:56,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck if I know anything I've ever been to Disneyland.

1172
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:57,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Jeez.

1173
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:57,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone just told me.

1174
01:05:58,170 --> 01:05:58,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh.

1175
01:05:58,731 --> 01:05:59,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Look it up, noob.

1176
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:00,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop being so poor.

1177
01:06:01,252 --> 01:06:01,552
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1178
01:06:01,652 --> 01:06:01,932
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1179
01:06:02,893 --> 01:06:03,553
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to be poor.

1180
01:06:03,613 --> 01:06:03,833
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1181
01:06:03,913 --> 01:06:05,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Any last words for our listeners, Extifer?

1182
01:06:07,795 --> 01:06:08,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, die.

1183
01:06:09,304 --> 01:06:10,524
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm kidding.

1184
01:06:10,584 --> 01:06:11,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Live, people, live.

1185
01:06:12,285 --> 01:06:12,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Rude.

1186
01:06:12,825 --> 01:06:13,565
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, live.

1187
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:14,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Just live.

1188
01:06:14,425 --> 01:06:15,125
[SPEAKER_04]: You're beautiful.

1189
01:06:15,365 --> 01:06:15,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1190
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:18,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, Christopher.

1191
01:06:18,326 --> 01:06:18,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1192
01:06:20,286 --> 01:06:21,866
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get some more calls.

1193
01:06:21,926 --> 01:06:31,588
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1194
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:32,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Waiting for some calls.

1195
01:06:32,868 --> 01:06:34,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Just waiting for some calls.

1196
01:06:37,049 --> 01:06:38,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1197
01:06:38,029 --> 01:06:38,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1198
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:40,289
[SPEAKER_00]: It's GS68.

1199
01:06:40,409 --> 01:06:41,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, GS68.

1200
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:41,949
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1201
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:45,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still playing Maximum Tune 3.

1202
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:46,530
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally got the soundtrack this week.

1203
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:47,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

1204
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:49,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw somebody linked me.

1205
01:06:49,131 --> 01:06:55,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was you or somebody linked me to where I could obtain the soundtrack for a low, low, low cost.

1206
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:56,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero.

1207
01:06:57,512 --> 01:06:58,673
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was just a very low cost.

1208
01:06:58,693 --> 01:06:59,893
[SPEAKER_04]: What soundtrack?

1209
01:07:00,513 --> 01:07:01,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Midnight Maximum Tune 3.

1210
01:07:01,733 --> 01:07:05,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that just really sucks that you don't have that yet.

1211
01:07:05,594 --> 01:07:06,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have that?

1212
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:10,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe you could play it for me.

1213
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Over and over.

1214
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,121
[SPEAKER_04]: On my iPod.

1215
01:07:14,161 --> 01:07:18,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, okay, so tell me a little bit about Maximum Tune 3.

1216
01:07:18,162 --> 01:07:19,322
[SPEAKER_14]: I would also like to hear it.

1217
01:07:19,842 --> 01:07:20,562
[SPEAKER_00]: The soundtrack?

1218
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:21,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

1219
01:07:22,743 --> 01:07:23,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very good so far.

1220
01:07:23,903 --> 01:07:29,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, especially, like, the songs.

1221
01:07:30,244 --> 01:07:33,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, especially, like, one song that sticks out is, like, Black Pressure.

1222
01:07:33,845 --> 01:07:36,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's not like the original...

1223
01:07:37,239 --> 01:07:42,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Max and Toon Soundtrack, like, there's a song called Destination Black that's, like, the Blackbirds theme.

1224
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Why's it always gotta be about the black songs?

1225
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:53,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, this song, like, starts off with some choir chanting, and that's what, like, made it stand out from the other songs.

1226
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:58,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Like... But it's still Eurobeat, right?

1227
01:07:59,804 --> 01:08:02,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, mostly... Still... Uh, wait, Eurobeat?

1228
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,885
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my heart... No, you're thinking of Initial D, silly.

1229
01:08:07,898 --> 01:08:09,439
[SPEAKER_04]: You think of initial D as the Eurobeat music?

1230
01:08:09,739 --> 01:08:11,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it still kind of is.

1231
01:08:11,901 --> 01:08:14,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of a Euro rave or something.

1232
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:15,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to explain it.

1233
01:08:15,584 --> 01:08:16,064
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm glad.

1234
01:08:16,764 --> 01:08:19,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Is number three as good of a soundtrack as number two, if not better?

1235
01:08:21,428 --> 01:08:22,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm liking it better.

1236
01:08:22,288 --> 01:08:26,291
[SPEAKER_00]: It has more... I'm worried about all the songs in my car.

1237
01:08:27,192 --> 01:08:28,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it good driving music?

1238
01:08:29,213 --> 01:08:32,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty good, but only when you're driving...

1239
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:36,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make sure to obey those speed laws, son.

1240
01:08:37,452 --> 01:08:40,594
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very good music to listen to in traffic jams.

1241
01:08:41,235 --> 01:08:44,477
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably not, because then you want to run over the cars like it's burnout.

1242
01:08:44,697 --> 01:08:51,941
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pause the music and rewind it back, because I don't want to be listening to that kind of music when I'm stopped, because it wouldn't feel right.

1243
01:08:53,682 --> 01:08:56,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, appreciate the review of the soundtrack.

1244
01:08:56,164 --> 01:08:57,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1245
01:08:59,306 --> 01:09:01,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jamie Moss' speed car is horrible.

1246
01:09:01,987 --> 01:09:03,208
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an okay song, but it's

1247
01:09:03,766 --> 01:09:05,408
[SPEAKER_00]: The cheesiest song I've ever heard.

1248
01:09:05,568 --> 01:09:06,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Which song was this?

1249
01:09:06,989 --> 01:09:09,111
[SPEAKER_00]: Speed Car, the one I was singing last week.

1250
01:09:09,731 --> 01:09:10,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1251
01:09:11,393 --> 01:09:12,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheesy.

1252
01:09:12,434 --> 01:09:12,694
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1253
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:14,696
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, thank you, GS68, for the phone call.

1254
01:09:14,736 --> 01:09:15,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.

1255
01:09:16,177 --> 01:09:16,598
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

1256
01:09:16,938 --> 01:09:17,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

1257
01:09:18,599 --> 01:09:18,980
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1258
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,622
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do one more call.

1259
01:09:21,642 --> 01:09:24,685
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1260
01:09:25,546 --> 01:09:26,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a call.

1261
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:26,607
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk.

1262
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:28,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Our number is 555-4444.

1263
01:09:28,188 --> 01:09:28,929
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just kidding.

1264
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:32,890
[SPEAKER_04]: We're waiting for that call.

1265
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:33,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here we go.

1266
01:09:33,471 --> 01:09:34,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1267
01:09:34,611 --> 01:09:34,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1268
01:09:36,592 --> 01:09:37,333
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Pooh Face.

1269
01:09:37,993 --> 01:09:38,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Pooh Face.

1270
01:09:38,734 --> 01:09:39,574
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1271
01:09:41,475 --> 01:09:46,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say how I'm really looking forward to Half-Life 2, the orange box.

1272
01:09:47,318 --> 01:09:49,560
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it about the orange box that has you so excited?

1273
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:56,003
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just been really... I really got into Half-Life 2 and Portal looks really sweet.

1274
01:09:56,163 --> 01:09:58,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I played the...

1275
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:15,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Project thing, the Narbacular Drop game, that was pretty cool, but it was really short, and Portal looks like it's going to make it a lot better, and of course there's Half-Life 2 Episode 2, which continues the story of Half-Life 2, and Team Fortress 2, I've been playing the beta for a couple weeks, that's pretty sweet.

1276
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:23,396
[SPEAKER_03]: All I'm hoping is that later on as a downloadable piece that they have Gary's mod, because that would be so awesome.

1277
01:10:23,897 --> 01:10:25,798
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my crappiezy at home, can't write Half-Life 2.

1278
01:10:26,478 --> 01:10:33,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Portal is, it looks kind of interesting, but I can't help but think, didn't Prey have something similar, where, like, you had little portals, but... No one played Prey!

1279
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:35,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, that's just, I played Prey!

1280
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:38,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the one first-person shooter I did play was Prey.

1281
01:10:38,623 --> 01:10:39,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I beat Prey.

1282
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:40,163
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Prey.

1283
01:10:40,183 --> 01:10:41,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I beat Prey.

1284
01:10:41,344 --> 01:10:49,467
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty cool, and that was what got me looking at Portal, because I thought the Portals and Prey were pretty cool, but... I think they just switched the graphics and made it the same game.

1285
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:51,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, um...

1286
01:10:52,626 --> 01:10:53,087
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the first month.

1287
01:10:53,107 --> 01:10:53,787
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the first month, hang on.

1288
01:10:53,807 --> 01:10:56,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you don't like first person shooters, it's not even necessarily a first person shooter.

1289
01:10:56,329 --> 01:10:57,310
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more of a first person puzzle game.

1290
01:10:57,330 --> 01:10:58,051
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really original and

1291
01:11:20,228 --> 01:11:27,574
[SPEAKER_08]: It just looks like a lot of fun, and especially for the PC version, because people are going to be coming out with mods, like for multiplayer probably, and custom maps.

1292
01:11:29,475 --> 01:11:36,081
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's fair, because I liked Metroid for that reason, just because it's not a shooter really, it's like an adventure, first person adventure game, so, good stuff.

1293
01:11:36,341 --> 01:11:37,822
[SPEAKER_04]: That, you're a total Nintendo fanboy.

1294
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:38,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, whatever.

1295
01:11:38,743 --> 01:11:41,925
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I don't like first person shooters on any system, even PC, so.

1296
01:11:41,985 --> 01:11:43,186
[SPEAKER_13]: I get uber motion sick.

1297
01:11:43,606 --> 01:11:46,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow, sorry Poohface, you had another thought I cut you off from.

1298
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:46,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh...

1299
01:11:49,645 --> 01:11:54,466
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I've also been looking forward to Guitar Hero 3, obviously.

1300
01:11:54,666 --> 01:11:56,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally looking forward to Guitar Hero 3.

1301
01:11:56,866 --> 01:11:57,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Me too.

1302
01:11:57,486 --> 01:11:58,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I actually have a guitar.

1303
01:11:59,087 --> 01:12:02,247
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like I only have to buy the game and no fucking peripheral this time.

1304
01:12:02,607 --> 01:12:07,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Unlike Rock Band where I'm going to have to buy the Uber box where nobody's going to want to come over and play with me.

1305
01:12:08,448 --> 01:12:11,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm actually getting Drum Mania instead of Rock Band.

1306
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:13,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you importing the one from Japan?

1307
01:12:18,374 --> 01:12:18,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1308
01:12:19,015 --> 01:12:19,735
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hardcore.

1309
01:12:19,775 --> 01:12:25,539
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't have the money to get the arcade-style DTX drum set, so I'm just getting the Konami controller.

1310
01:12:26,019 --> 01:12:26,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you go.

1311
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,622
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll do, as long as it gets you through the game.

1312
01:12:29,782 --> 01:12:30,542
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all that's important.

1313
01:12:31,063 --> 01:12:35,986
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, it sounds like you have a very busy gaming next couple of months between Orange Box and Drum Mania.

1314
01:12:36,006 --> 01:12:36,847
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be very busy.

1315
01:12:37,427 --> 01:12:39,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other last-minute thoughts for our listeners?

1316
01:12:40,809 --> 01:12:40,989
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1317
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:41,670
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1318
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Pooface, thank you very much for the call.

1319
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:44,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a wonderful week.

1320
01:12:44,612 --> 01:12:45,272
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1321
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:46,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope to hear from you again.

1322
01:12:46,233 --> 01:12:46,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1323
01:12:46,893 --> 01:12:47,154
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1324
01:12:47,214 --> 01:12:47,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1325
01:12:48,356 --> 01:12:49,736
[SPEAKER_04]: PooFace hasn't been listening for a little while.

1326
01:12:49,776 --> 01:12:53,357
[SPEAKER_04]: He just returned tonight for our 250th episode, so happy to hear from him.

1327
01:12:53,637 --> 01:12:56,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to remind everybody that I had the orange box last year.

1328
01:12:58,178 --> 01:12:58,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm?

1329
01:12:58,978 --> 01:13:00,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I had the orange box last year.

1330
01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:02,119
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I still have it.

1331
01:13:02,139 --> 01:13:03,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really use it too much, though.

1332
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:05,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that what you called something of yours?

1333
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:06,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1334
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:06,980
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, what?

1335
01:13:07,821 --> 01:13:09,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Young Orange Songs Radio.

1336
01:13:10,061 --> 01:13:11,061
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Raven Stolfen.

1337
01:13:11,561 --> 01:13:12,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed you, Bucket.

1338
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:13,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

1339
01:13:14,645 --> 01:13:19,147
[SPEAKER_10]: We just want to wish you a happy 250th episode from the Techie Game Podcast

1340
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:43,221
[SPEAKER_10]: and now we're number 14.

1341
01:13:43,281 --> 01:13:45,762
[SPEAKER_04]: We're slightly getting back up there.

1342
01:13:46,182 --> 01:13:49,524
[SPEAKER_04]: We're number 69, which is an okay place to be, honestly.

1343
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:54,386
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hilarious.

1344
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:55,907
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my producer, Toki.

1345
01:13:55,927 --> 01:13:57,027
[SPEAKER_10]: She produces the show.

1346
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:00,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, there's a lot of you.

1347
01:14:00,909 --> 01:14:01,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a girl.

1348
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:01,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

1349
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:06,892
[SPEAKER_04]: She's my co-host.

1350
01:14:06,932 --> 01:14:07,932
[SPEAKER_04]: God, what was I going to ask?

1351
01:14:08,013 --> 01:14:08,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1352
01:14:09,676 --> 01:14:10,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Is she hot?

1353
01:14:10,556 --> 01:14:12,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess wants to know if she's hot.

1354
01:14:12,517 --> 01:14:14,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you... I think so.

1355
01:14:14,998 --> 01:14:15,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1356
01:14:15,358 --> 01:14:19,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Raven and her, you know, they've been together for like six months now.

1357
01:14:19,639 --> 01:14:21,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a little showmance going on?

1358
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:23,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a showmance going on on Tekken games?

1359
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,681
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

1360
01:14:25,741 --> 01:14:26,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all, Scott.

1361
01:14:26,401 --> 01:14:27,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it's all a publicity stunt.

1362
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:31,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear her in the background going, What's your publicity stunt here?

1363
01:14:31,082 --> 01:14:32,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not your publicity stunt!

1364
01:14:32,162 --> 01:14:36,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Rook tried to fake it like you guys had a child or something that was illegitimate.

1365
01:14:36,324 --> 01:14:37,024
[SPEAKER_10]: He never did.

1366
01:14:38,064 --> 01:14:39,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, we did call in for something, Sky.

1367
01:14:40,125 --> 01:14:41,606
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to talk about the Orange Box.

1368
01:14:42,046 --> 01:14:44,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, it's all the rage this week.

1369
01:14:44,967 --> 01:14:50,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It would make sense that people think the Orange Lounge show is about the Orange Box, so we forgive the confusion.

1370
01:14:50,109 --> 01:14:51,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Box Radio.

1371
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:52,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about the Orange Box.

1372
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:53,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see the commercial?

1373
01:14:53,851 --> 01:14:57,792
[SPEAKER_04]: We should call our show next week Orange Box Radio, just to fuck with people.

1374
01:14:58,373 --> 01:14:58,893
[SPEAKER_04]: It is stupid.

1375
01:14:58,933 --> 01:15:00,214
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, what do you want to say about Orange Box?

1376
01:15:00,494 --> 01:15:03,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you see the commercial for the Orange Box?

1377
01:15:04,344 --> 01:15:04,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

1378
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:06,685
[SPEAKER_04]: It was during the Sarah Silverman program.

1379
01:15:06,725 --> 01:15:08,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the commercial for the Orange Box.

1380
01:15:08,026 --> 01:15:09,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you hear what they said about Half-Life?

1381
01:15:10,307 --> 01:15:11,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh God, you were watching that.

1382
01:15:11,588 --> 01:15:14,109
[SPEAKER_04]: No, what did, or what, like Game of the Year or something?

1383
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, greatest game ever.

1384
01:15:16,711 --> 01:15:18,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Greater than Zelda, greater than anything.

1385
01:15:19,312 --> 01:15:20,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Greatest game ever.

1386
01:15:20,253 --> 01:15:23,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it that they said, this is the game of the year in 2002.

1387
01:15:27,997 --> 01:15:33,440
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's, well, I mean, like, come on, when they sell movies, like when they do, when they do like DVDs.

1388
01:15:34,415 --> 01:15:34,956
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1389
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,122
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1390
01:16:13,259 --> 01:16:15,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, our podcast is award winning.

1391
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,321
[SPEAKER_06]: We've won awards.

1392
01:16:16,341 --> 01:16:18,181
[SPEAKER_06]: We got like two thumbs up from some guy.

1393
01:16:18,221 --> 01:16:22,343
[SPEAKER_04]: We go like, hey, we're a four-time nominee for Best of Life 365 in 2003.

1394
01:16:22,983 --> 01:16:24,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, look at the iTunes store.

1395
01:16:24,124 --> 01:16:25,444
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some good reviews, man.

1396
01:16:25,464 --> 01:16:27,305
[SPEAKER_06]: None of that pew-pew-pew shit.

1397
01:16:27,325 --> 01:16:28,406
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some good reviews.

1398
01:16:30,626 --> 01:16:31,807
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't get some mew-mew-mews.

1399
01:16:31,847 --> 01:16:32,987
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some good stuff.

1400
01:16:33,007 --> 01:16:34,188
[SPEAKER_06]: People saying we're the greatest.

1401
01:16:34,248 --> 01:16:36,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you should get on here so people can hear you.

1402
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:38,518
[SPEAKER_06]: You got awards.

1403
01:16:38,799 --> 01:16:39,119
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1404
01:16:39,639 --> 01:16:42,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guys, we've got to let you go because we've got to wrap up the show because, damn, we've been going a long time.

1405
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:43,201
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

1406
01:16:43,221 --> 01:16:44,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for letting us get on.

1407
01:16:44,602 --> 01:16:45,083
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

1408
01:16:45,383 --> 01:16:47,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, you guys.

1409
01:16:47,064 --> 01:16:47,364
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

1410
01:16:47,904 --> 01:16:48,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1411
01:16:48,685 --> 01:16:49,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1412
01:16:49,445 --> 01:16:50,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, producer.

1413
01:16:50,426 --> 01:16:50,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

1414
01:16:52,087 --> 01:16:52,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1415
01:16:52,547 --> 01:16:53,208
[SPEAKER_04]: They hung up on us.

1416
01:16:55,849 --> 01:16:56,530
[SPEAKER_14]: See you later.

1417
01:16:57,611 --> 01:16:57,891
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1418
01:16:57,951 --> 01:16:58,331
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1419
01:16:58,391 --> 01:16:59,632
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to close up the Skype line.

1420
01:16:59,652 --> 01:17:01,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys very much for calling in tonight.

1421
01:17:01,553 --> 01:17:01,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

1422
01:17:02,354 --> 01:17:05,015
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we need to wrap up the show because we've been going a long time tonight.

1423
01:17:05,055 --> 01:17:06,396
[SPEAKER_04]: First, any last-minute stories?

1424
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:06,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1425
01:17:07,297 --> 01:17:07,577
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1426
01:17:08,052 --> 01:17:09,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, a couple just real small here.

1427
01:17:11,234 --> 01:17:15,736
[SPEAKER_03]: The simple series, one of my favorite things to talk about from D3, is coming to the Wii.

1428
01:17:16,897 --> 01:17:18,417
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have the first few titles.

1429
01:17:19,358 --> 01:17:21,319
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all, of course, coming to Japan.

1430
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:26,542
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is the Mina de Kart Race.

1431
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:27,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Mina.

1432
01:17:27,842 --> 01:17:29,963
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mina de Kart Race.

1433
01:17:30,143 --> 01:17:30,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody Kart Race.

1434
01:17:31,084 --> 01:17:32,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Everybody Kart Race.

1435
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:33,885
[SPEAKER_03]: It's slated for October 25th.

1436
01:17:34,746 --> 01:17:36,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they also have Mina de...

1437
01:17:37,956 --> 01:17:45,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Bassuri Taikai, or the Everybody's Fishing Conference, also coming out on the 25th.

1438
01:17:47,368 --> 01:17:47,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1439
01:17:48,309 --> 01:17:50,532
[SPEAKER_03]: The Party Casino coming in December.

1440
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:53,195
[SPEAKER_03]: The Shooting Action coming in December.

1441
01:17:55,900 --> 01:18:07,622
[SPEAKER_03]: the Block Kuzushi, or the Block Destructions, coming out February next year, and the YY Combat, which I have no translation for, also coming in February.

1442
01:18:08,082 --> 01:18:16,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the Onichanbara R is supposed to be coming out to the Wii, and that's that one for those who don't remember.

1443
01:18:16,564 --> 01:18:21,125
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the sexy zombie killer game, which is basically the chick wearing just a...

1444
01:18:22,176 --> 01:18:23,437
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not the fishing conference game.

1445
01:18:23,477 --> 01:18:24,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1446
01:18:24,118 --> 01:18:25,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be busy playing that.

1447
01:18:43,717 --> 01:18:52,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's supposedly working on a game that's going to support the Wii balance board that's going to be a snowboarding title and rumors are that it's going to be the 1080 game coming back.

1448
01:18:53,323 --> 01:18:55,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So, maybe.

1449
01:18:55,384 --> 01:18:59,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm assuming someday there'll be a snowboarding game that'll support that.

1450
01:19:00,367 --> 01:19:06,831
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, one piece of Wii accessories that will not be coming out to the market will be

1451
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,022
[SPEAKER_03]: The Nyko Wii Party Station.

1452
01:19:10,062 --> 01:19:15,725
[SPEAKER_03]: If you remember, that's that stupid thing that they had to hold controllers, chips and soda, and all sorts of stuff like that.

1453
01:19:16,045 --> 01:19:24,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, originally they were marketing it as $25, but it ended up having to come out for the price of $50.

1454
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:28,051
[SPEAKER_03]: And so no one decided to buy it.

1455
01:19:28,992 --> 01:19:33,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and by the way, it also had LED scoreboards for your Wii tournaments.

1456
01:19:34,494 --> 01:19:35,815
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1457
01:19:58,649 --> 01:20:01,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that is going to bring our 250th episode to a close.

1458
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:03,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And that deserves applause.

1459
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:04,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God it's over.

1460
01:20:04,871 --> 01:20:05,171
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1461
01:20:05,831 --> 01:20:07,711
[SPEAKER_04]: But first we have to get everybody's final thoughts.

1462
01:20:07,851 --> 01:20:09,312
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll start off with DarkSakura.

1463
01:20:09,532 --> 01:20:11,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Your final thought tonight.

1464
01:20:12,092 --> 01:20:12,713
[SPEAKER_15]: I like beer.

1465
01:20:13,733 --> 01:20:14,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you now?

1466
01:20:14,313 --> 01:20:15,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any particular type of beer?

1467
01:20:15,753 --> 01:20:16,494
[SPEAKER_15]: I like Newcastle.

1468
01:20:16,914 --> 01:20:17,194
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1469
01:20:18,354 --> 01:20:19,794
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go around in a circle here.

1470
01:20:19,834 --> 01:20:21,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Casper the Gay, your final thought tonight.

1471
01:20:21,435 --> 01:20:22,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for being here, by the way.

1472
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,076
[SPEAKER_07]: When you play video games, children's do learn.

1473
01:20:27,111 --> 01:20:27,352
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1474
01:20:28,974 --> 01:20:29,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

1475
01:20:31,919 --> 01:20:33,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Rice Princess, your final thought.

1476
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:35,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1477
01:20:36,606 --> 01:20:37,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

1478
01:20:39,105 --> 01:20:45,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And just when you thought Sony was done with releasing new SKUs, there is another rumor coming out of Japan.

1479
01:20:45,906 --> 01:20:49,067
[SPEAKER_03]: About a 160 gigabyte PS3 system.

1480
01:20:49,467 --> 01:20:55,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, this will come with 160 gigabytes of memory on your hard drive there.

1481
01:20:55,468 --> 01:21:01,550
[SPEAKER_03]: It will also feature six USB ports, two HDMI outs, and the three Ethernet ports.

1482
01:21:01,930 --> 01:21:04,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Much like the original design they showed.

1483
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:08,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, actually, they have a brand new SKU that's been logged in.

1484
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,281
[SPEAKER_04]: and it will do your dishes and suck your dick.

1485
01:21:12,381 --> 01:21:15,642
[SPEAKER_04]: In related news, Japanese men everywhere are marrying their PlayStations.

1486
01:21:15,863 --> 01:21:18,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the fuck does it need three fucking Ethernet ports is what I want to know.

1487
01:21:19,304 --> 01:21:22,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, what the fuck do you need that many Ethernet ports for?

1488
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:29,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1489
01:21:29,949 --> 01:21:30,269
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1490
01:21:30,409 --> 01:21:31,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it, Loki?

1491
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:32,290
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1492
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:38,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure, as with all other Sony rumors, it will probably become true soon enough.

1493
01:21:39,193 --> 01:21:39,513
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1494
01:21:40,591 --> 01:21:41,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy, your final thought.

1495
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:42,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being here tonight.

1496
01:21:43,092 --> 01:21:43,692
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought?

1497
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:44,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1498
01:21:44,632 --> 01:21:45,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Believe.

1499
01:21:46,893 --> 01:21:47,253
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1500
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:49,173
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought.

1501
01:21:49,193 --> 01:21:50,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Master Chief will save us.

1502
01:21:51,234 --> 01:21:55,715
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is 250 episodes later, and you know what?

1503
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:57,936
[SPEAKER_04]: George Takei is still awesome.

1504
01:21:59,316 --> 01:22:01,257
[SPEAKER_04]: He is still fucking awesome.

1505
01:22:01,717 --> 01:22:02,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my.

1506
01:22:03,621 --> 01:22:06,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for another week of Orange Launch Radio.

1507
01:22:06,323 --> 01:22:09,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

1508
01:22:10,066 --> 01:22:12,247
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like what you hear, remember we do this shit for free.

1509
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,109
[SPEAKER_04]: All we ask is for a little word of mouth.

1510
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:15,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go advertise.

1511
01:22:15,469 --> 01:22:16,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell two people about our show.

1512
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:21,254
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have no friends, or even if you do have friends, leave a comment on the iTunes.

1513
01:22:21,274 --> 01:22:22,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I Ron Popeil now?

1514
01:22:22,835 --> 01:22:23,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I Ron Popeil?

1515
01:22:24,036 --> 01:22:25,717
[SPEAKER_04]: For only three low payments of $39.99.

1516
01:22:25,957 --> 01:22:26,137
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

1517
01:22:26,177 --> 01:22:26,377
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

1518
01:22:26,397 --> 01:22:27,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Three low payments of $14.95.

1519
01:22:27,878 --> 01:22:28,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

1520
01:22:32,574 --> 01:22:36,356
[SPEAKER_17]: What was it that Mitch Hedberg said?

1521
01:22:36,957 --> 01:22:38,978
[SPEAKER_17]: Three easy payments and one difficult payment?

1522
01:22:39,499 --> 01:22:39,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1523
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was actually the other guy.

1524
01:22:44,762 --> 01:22:45,563
[SPEAKER_16]: That was Mitch Hedberg.

1525
01:22:46,163 --> 01:22:47,804
[SPEAKER_16]: I just listened to this on Friday at work.

1526
01:22:47,984 --> 01:22:49,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I thought you said Dane Cook for some reason.

1527
01:22:50,125 --> 01:22:53,908
[SPEAKER_17]: No, Dane Cook would have just made obnoxious noises and then talked about his penis.

1528
01:22:54,769 --> 01:23:01,413
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the thing was I somehow got my list of comedians who died mixed with comedians I wish would die.

1529
01:23:02,378 --> 01:23:02,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

1530
01:23:02,998 --> 01:23:04,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't wish death on anyone.

1531
01:23:04,158 --> 01:23:05,079
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really mean.

1532
01:23:05,299 --> 01:23:05,999
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Dane Cook.

1533
01:23:06,059 --> 01:23:06,359
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't.

1534
01:23:06,859 --> 01:23:07,159
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1535
01:23:08,379 --> 01:23:09,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, can we end the show now, please?

1536
01:23:10,099 --> 01:23:10,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1537
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:10,780
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1538
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1539
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,621
