00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,360
Tonight, October 7th, 2007, Bungie and Microsoft file for divorce, World of Warcraft celebrates

2
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:29,760
alcohol, and Nintendo gives something away to all Wii owners.

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,920
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture,

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,320
and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,480
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,740
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,080
I'm starting Octoberfest early.

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Are you?

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Yes I am, with British ale.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Enjoy.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,080
What are you drinking tonight?

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
Newcastle.

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
Yummy.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,080
Best ever.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,400
Also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,520
I'm drinking watered down Coke from McDonald's.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,280
You sure don't have a party.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,400
I'm very disappointed in your Germanness.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,000
Their fries sucked.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,360
And also say hello, joining us tonight, this somebody has not been on our program in a

22
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,420
damn long time, but he's here tonight.

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,480
Say hello to Black Lab, aka Puppy.

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,920
I made it out of Davis alive, thank God.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,420
Yes, he used to be our correspondent for the People's Republic of Davis, which if you live

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,720
where our show is taped, Sacramento, you understand why that joke is funny, but if you're an international

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,120
or national listener, you have no clue what we're talking about, but just trust us, it's

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
funny.

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,800
But you're free from the perils of Davis now.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
Yes I am.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
And you're living on your own.

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Yes, actually, I am.

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,520
They've let you out of the prisoner camp.

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,880
Rule number one of living on your own, make sure the mic is real close to your mouth,

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
because they're not very sensitive.

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
Okay.

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,160
Just don't eat it.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,340
So what have you been up to since you've been on the show last?

39
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,800
How long has it been?

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,040
It's been like at least a year now.

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,560
Aren't we in double digits?

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
I think so.

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
The first time he was here.

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,040
Well, Puppy, you used to work in an arcade, and that's one thing you used to kind of come

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,140
on the show and talk to us about.

46
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,040
What arcade did you use to work at a long time ago?

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,280
Castro Valley Golf Land.

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,640
And what kinds of big popular machines were there at Castro Valley Golf Land?

49
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,080
Oh, I think one of them dancing machines, I think.

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Oh, the dance game?

51
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,480
Oh, they had Time Crisis 3.

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
That was pretty popular.

53
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,280
That all the dancing fools played?

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,600
Yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,400
I think I was one of them.

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,840
All right.

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,960
So would you say that the skills that you learned working at an arcade have helped you

58
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
in the real world?

59
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
No.

60
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
No.

61
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,440
You didn't learn anything there, huh?

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
Not a damn thing.

63
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,200
Except that I hate kids.

64
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,920
It was one step above flipping burgers, yes?

65
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Yeah.

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Or would you...

67
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,080
I still had to serve pizza on weekends for parties, but...

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,640
Or in retrospect, would you rather have been frying French fries incorrectly at McDonald's?

69
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,800
I would know how to fry something at McDonald's because I would actually understand the instrument.

70
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Instructional videos.

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,920
Everyone is listening to my ass right now.

72
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Yeah, Jamie just sat on the...

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,880
There was one time that people got pissed off at McDonald's because I was sitting in

74
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,240
the middle of the lobby with a chair that I had pulled out from a table and sitting

75
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,720
there talking because my friends were all talking and just sitting there and talking

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,800
or basically standing there and talking, and I got tired of standing there so I pulled

77
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,240
over a chair and sat down next to everybody, and then the manager comes over and he's like,

78
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,960
what the fuck is that chair doing in the middle of this lobby?

79
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,480
Meanwhile, I mean, it's like they're almost closed anyways and there's no one there.

80
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
Is that how they really talk?

81
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,840
What about a bunch of potty mouths?

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,520
Well, he was a stoner, so... an angry stoner, which is weird.

83
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,600
How do you have an angry stoner?

84
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,600
I know.

85
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
How do you get an angry stoner?

86
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Easy.

87
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,000
You don't give him any pot, then he's an angry stoner.

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Or what?

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,400
Don't give him Twinkies?

90
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Or something like that.

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Well, he's into McDonald's.

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,840
I mean, he can eat a bunch of shit.

93
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,840
I'd be angry there and not even have to work there.

94
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
My other friends used to work at McDonald's.

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,600
We, on the other hand, were part of another clique, the Round Table Gang.

96
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,840
The Round Table Gang?

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
No, not really.

98
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,560
Boy, that sounds threatening.

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,800
Hey, we're gonna pizza your face!

100
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
I don't know.

101
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,280
I got to operate a large knife.

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
No.

103
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,040
Really, no, I didn't go around going, hey, we're part of the Round Table Gang.

104
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,680
No, we worked at Round Table.

105
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,720
We're a commune of Round Table people.

106
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,240
Well, folks, you'll notice there's two empty chairs back here if you're watching on our

107
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,840
Operator 11 live webcam or our archive.

108
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,040
There's two empty chairs back here.

109
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,560
That's because Rice Princess and Casper the Gay, or whatever his name is, are joining

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,400
us tonight, but they're late because they're at Target doing, or, I'm sorry, as Casper

111
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,240
might say, Tar-jay, getting Lord knows what at Target.

112
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,440
So they're not, hopefully a table, a real table for Loki, we'll see.

113
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
But they're not here.

114
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,860
I don't need a table because there would be no room for a table in here.

115
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
But they'll be here.

116
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,860
But who needs them?

117
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,860
Because we have the chat.

118
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,860
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

119
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,860
We love our chatters.

120
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,520
Thank you guys so much for joining us.

121
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,640
And let me just start off by saying, if you're listening tonight, this is episode number

122
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,740
250 of Orange Lounge Radio, if you can believe it.

123
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,740
That's quite a landmark.

124
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,740
That's the beer.

125
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,240
And in fact, all of you guys who are listening, congratulations.

126
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,360
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.

127
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Oops.

128
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
No, not that.

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,680
I don't have to be an edit.

130
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,400
I started drinking a little early tonight.

131
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,000
And for those of you guys who are listening live, congratulations.

132
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,300
You just unlocked an achievement.

133
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,840
You just survived 250 episodes of this crap.

134
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,640
So you get 100 points and your game was scored.

135
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Congratulations.

136
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,600
All right, let's get into our gaming week and start it off with Dark Soccer.

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
How was your gaming week?

138
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
I'm eating popcorn.

139
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Just get me.

140
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
All right, then Logie.

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Come back to me.

142
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
All right.

143
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
God, you're needy tonight.

144
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
All right.

145
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm going to go sit in the chairs, because I feel bad that the OP11 people are looking

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
at nothing.

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So I'll sit in the chairs.

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm looking at my laptop, apparently.

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
All right.

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hey, Pete.

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
All right.

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,200
So this week, I played a shit ton of Ragnarok.

153
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,600
And I'm not talking about my regular, you know, butt load.

154
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,460
I'm talking about a shit ton of Ragnarok.

155
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,660
So it's like a shit ton.

156
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
Is that like metric?

157
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,660
It's metric.

158
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:55,720
Or if I was going to go with the Don French description, it would be croc shit, sir Ragnarok.

159
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,920
Or like shit kilo, you know.

160
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,920
So I have been, I decided to start a new class.

161
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,140
I started it last night.

162
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,840
It's called the Taekwon Girl.

163
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,360
And you don't get weapons, you just kick things in the face.

164
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,440
You just kick them in the face.

165
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,000
Can we get a live demonstration?

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Puppy, lie down.

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No.

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,400
I don't think so.

169
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,080
And then I started the character last night, and I'm playing today.

170
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,620
Got her up to a star gladiator, which was actually kind of a really weird game earlier.

171
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,600
So I now have her at level 70.

172
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,960
And I started her yesterday.

173
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
Last night.

174
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,520
Go pirate servers.

175
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Awesome job.

176
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,520
All right.

177
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,320
And I don't have to work tomorrow, so I'm going to play more games tomorrow.

178
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Good job.

179
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Well, sounds good.

180
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,400
Well, let's keep right on moving along.

181
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,600
Loki, how was your gaming week?

182
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
My gaming week was fun.

183
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
I've been continuing playing Halo on Legendary.

184
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,600
I finally got past the part that I was stuck because I realized, hey, I can go backtrack

185
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,160
and there's a ton of weapons back there.

186
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Holy shit.

187
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,400
Forgot all about that stuff.

188
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,080
And so you can play with the AI because they won't go past a certain part.

189
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,180
They'll chase after you and stuff and be like, ha, I'm in the save zone or some shit.

190
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,900
You can't attack me and they'll run back.

191
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,900
It's funny.

192
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,900
The AI is kind of dumb.

193
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,960
Have you done the confetti head thing?

194
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
No.

195
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,480
I'm playing through just by myself.

196
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,980
Dark Soccer's husband showed me the head shot confetti thing.

197
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,480
That is hilarious.

198
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,920
It makes, like you shoot off the thing and it makes this little, I think we have the

199
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,160
exact same noise in our audio library.

200
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,860
It has these little kids cheering when you do it.

201
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,120
I'm looking for the, keep going.

202
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
I'll imitate them anyways.

203
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,960
So other stuff I've been playing, I actually bought, what was it, Flat Out Ultimate Carnage.

204
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,700
That game is fucking awesome.

205
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,720
It's just lots of driving, crashing into things.

206
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,040
I played the Ragdoll Olympics stuff for quite a while, so I was launching my character through

207
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,720
windshields and flinging him down a ski slope, stuff like that.

208
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,000
Real fun game though.

209
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,800
And see other stuff I've been playing, actually, you know, I think that's about it.

210
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,320
I'm kind of working a little bit through the Jackass PSP game still.

211
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,440
And then, I don't know, I meant to get more games this week, but I didn't get around to

212
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
it.

213
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,360
So, maybe next week, you know.

214
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,400
And then I also meant to play the Simpsons demo because I downloaded it on my PS3.

215
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,920
But I didn't get a chance to play it because my wife wanted to watch Food Network instead.

216
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
So.

217
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Food Network is great.

218
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,360
Awesome.

219
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,680
So is that it for your gaming week?

220
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
That is it.

221
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
All right.

222
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
Puppy!

223
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,240
Since you're here tonight, have you been playing any video games this week?

224
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
If so, what?

225
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
And how's it going?

226
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,200
I actually have been playing games about, I didn't have any systems until about a month

227
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
ago and then I finally caved and bought a 360.

228
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,800
And I've just been playing Halo for the last week and a half.

229
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,320
You need to come to our house and play Halo 3 with us.

230
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,520
I might try to do that.

231
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,920
And how is Halo going?

232
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
Are you a big fan of the Halo?

233
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,120
Yeah, I am.

234
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,800
Sadly.

235
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,720
I'm still confused by some things in the plot and other than that, I just shoot things.

236
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,840
And I like the little grunt head explosions.

237
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,880
Yes, I found the sound effects.

238
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,600
So when you shoot them in the head, you get this.

239
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,680
It makes that little sound effect.

240
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,100
And a little confetti blows up everywhere.

241
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,100
It's awesome.

242
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,280
It's fun when you turn up the explosions on that too so that when you shoot one in the

243
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,600
head, all the ones around them go off too and explode.

244
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,640
Time was going around punching people in the head with the skull.

245
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,860
That was pretty cool.

246
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,280
So that's it for your gaming week?

247
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Yeah, pretty much.

248
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,920
I was playing WoW for a while, but ever since Halo 3 came out, I pretty much stopped.

249
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,380
Well finally joining us, they're a little bit late tonight, so you guys are so fired,

250
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,380
but they're here in studio.

251
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,760
Say hello to Rice Princess and what are we calling you now, Casper?

252
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Casper the gang.

253
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
He's Eddie to me.

254
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,880
He'll always be Eddie.

255
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,080
So Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

256
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,080
What have you been playing?

257
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Wow.

258
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,120
Does it ever change really?

259
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
That's pretty much it.

260
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,400
Hey, you have my sweater.

261
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I'm so glad.

262
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,840
Yes, you left your sweater here.

263
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,920
My Alliance sweater.

264
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,320
What's hilarious is that the only way we knew who it belonged to is that we saw that it

265
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,800
was an Alliance sweatshirt that you left here and we were like, who the fuck plays Alliance?

266
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Only cool people do.

267
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,120
And we were like, oh, it must be Rice Princess.

268
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Bleh.

269
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Whatever.

270
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Please take this thing out of my house.

271
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
I will.

272
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
She's an Alliance character, at least she's sort of evil.

273
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,080
The only reason worth playing Alliance is for the Jurnai, but it gets old.

274
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Whatever.

275
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Whatever.

276
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
And if you want to play with 12 year olds.

277
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
You can play a warlock.

278
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,560
And if you want to play a cool side.

279
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,160
You can play warlocks on Horde's side.

280
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
They're much cooler.

281
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,160
Warlocks are much better.

282
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Because undead are horse.

283
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Warlocks are lame.

284
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
You're lame.

285
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Anyway, anything else you want to add?

286
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,160
Before we turn into the wow cast, is there anything else you want to share for your gaming

287
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
week?

288
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
No.

289
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
All right.

290
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Then Casper, how was your gaming week?

291
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
It was awesome.

292
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,680
I got Phantom Hourglass, new Zelda game for DS.

293
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
It was really good.

294
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
You like it?

295
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Yeah, it's really good.

296
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Finally, they get to not make you fumble between the D-pad and the buttons and the stylus all

297
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,840
at the same time.

298
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,520
It's all stylus and it's very smooth.

299
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,320
It's a very cool control style.

300
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,120
So tell me a little more about it, because I'm contemplating if I want to buy it or not.

301
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,660
So how does it play compared to the other Zeldas?

302
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,160
Is it more Wind Waker?

303
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,200
Is it more Super Nintendo Zelda?

304
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,420
It's a direct sequel to Wind Waker.

305
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,840
It takes place right after the end of Wind Waker.

306
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Same style.

307
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
It's like that cel shading.

308
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,680
It's pretty good for the DS, but it still looks pretty good.

309
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,720
Just really cool control style.

310
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,960
You basically slash with the stylus on the screen or you tap things to attack them, all

311
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,840
that kind of stuff.

312
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,000
There's a map screen that you write on, write little notes and stuff, which I thought would

313
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
be kind of gimmicky at first, but it actually works out.

314
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,960
Some of the puzzles are centered around making notes and things like that, so it's pretty

315
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
cool.

316
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Good times.

317
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,560
So on a scale of 1 to 10, but you're a Zelda fan boy.

318
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,960
I'm a Zelda fan boy.

319
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm not a huge fan of Wind Waker, but it's still good.

320
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,520
You know, I'm hoping that Ganon's in there somewhere, but I haven't gotten that far yet.

321
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,120
And GS68 in our chat room is screaming, no spoilers.

322
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
So please don't.

323
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I'm not that far, so I really can't spoil anything.

324
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,680
I don't use the no spoilers until Aris gets it, so go ahead and spoil.

325
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
I don't care.

326
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
Let her die!

327
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,680
Yeah, Link dies at the end.

328
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Ah!

329
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
All right.

330
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,020
Anyhow, my gaming week, I've also been playing World of Warcraft.

331
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,280
I got to level 68, so I have a flying mount now.

332
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,520
Or I am a flying mount, because I play a druid, so I get a free flying mount.

333
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,480
Or if it's not free, it costs me eight gold.

334
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,420
And I ran instances.

335
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,280
As a guild, we ran underbog and slave pens.

336
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,480
And that's how I leveled.

337
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,280
I feel like this week's episode of the Sarah Silverman program, all of a sudden, where

338
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
they were playing D&D for 24 hours straight.

339
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Anyway.

340
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
I've done that.

341
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,360
You're the hardcorest of the nerds.

342
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,960
You're queen of the nerd people.

343
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
She's just a princess.

344
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,720
You're the queen.

345
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Let's see.

346
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,000
So also my gaming week, I played Tetris Splash.

347
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,560
I actually bought the new Tetris Splash, which was the Xbox Live arcade game of the week.

348
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,720
And Tetris Splash is okay.

349
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,680
I mean, it's Tetris, and it has its competitive mode, which plays really smoothly on Xbox

350
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,160
Live, I've got to say.

351
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,680
And seems like the audience of people playing the game, not a lot of jerks, which is good.

352
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
You get some pretty good people.

353
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,360
Some people who are really skilled at Tetris.

354
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,160
I got my butt whooped in a ranked match by some people who are really good at Tetris,

355
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
and I'm not so competitive.

356
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Tetris is fun.

357
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
They have that on DS.

358
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
And it was like, it's crazy.

359
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
I'm like, Tetris.

360
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
Oh, but it's fun.

361
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Here's why Tetris Splash pissed me off, though, is it just made the fact that I actually bought

362
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,000
Tetris Evolution even more salt in the wound.

363
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,040
Because that game was like 30 bucks on Xbox 360, and then it releases a $10 version.

364
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm so mad.

365
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,520
Like why did they do that?

366
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Why?

367
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,480
They didn't even wait like six months.

368
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,280
Tetris Evolution came out like three months ago.

369
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,640
And now we have an even slightly, I don't know if you'd say better version.

370
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,200
I think it is kind of a better version.

371
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
It doesn't have the HD videos.

372
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,960
It has that stupid aquarium.

373
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,120
It looks like a screensaver from After Dark.

374
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,400
But here's the thing that pissed me off about that is, have you heard about the microtransactions

375
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
with this?

376
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
No.

377
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:22,280
The day they released Tetris Splash on Xbox Live Arcade.

378
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,960
They released 15 different download packs for Tetris Splash.

379
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
What?

380
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,120
No, maybe it's like 11.

381
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,960
But it's more than 10.

382
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:36,880
Between 80 and 150 points per download, and you know what these things are?

383
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,960
They're just new fish for your tank, or new tanks to put the fish in.

384
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,800
Now let me ask you, do you play Tetris to stare at the background?

385
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,840
No.

386
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,120
So what's the point of downloading fish and fish tanks?

387
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,520
Then don't buy it.

388
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,160
There's a sucker born every second.

389
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
How about this?

390
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,100
It's either that or they could have made the game more expensive and threw them in there

391
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,600
for free, which I think would have been a better move to make the money.

392
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,240
I think a better move would have been what they were starting to do, which is you unlock

393
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,560
more fish as you unlock more achievements or you get lines in the game.

394
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,680
You and your logic and your critical thinking.

395
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,040
I mean, heaven forbid, I could not believe that.

396
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,360
If you buy this stuff, you're a sucker.

397
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,280
You're an absolute sucker.

398
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:30,800
When you buy this stuff, I got some Guitar Hero download packs for you.

399
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,920
I love Tetris, which is why this makes me mad.

400
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,080
I feel like Tetris on the 360 is like fucked beyond belief between this whole evolution

401
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,020
and now microtransaction fish tank thing.

402
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:43,160
By the way, Rob, I hate the word microtransaction.

403
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Well that's what it is.

404
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,240
A microtransaction is a transaction no matter how big or small.

405
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Well that's what they call it, but why don't you write a letter to EA and all those people.

406
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,080
I have the same problem with pre-boarding because you're not really pre-boarding, you're

407
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
just boarding.

408
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Early.

409
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,880
Why you got to derail my segment, huh?

410
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,400
Well technically a microtransaction is an accurate description.

411
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,680
It's a transaction that is small, hence micro.

412
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,320
If it were a Jolly Rancher for five cents, would that be a microtransaction?

413
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
This is a sucker.

414
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,680
Yes, it would be a microtransaction.

415
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,960
What defines micro or macro?

416
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,360
This is a suck transaction because if you buy this, you suck.

417
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,600
If I buy a computer, is it a macrotransaction?

418
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,320
If you support this, you suck.

419
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,280
A macrotransaction would be, for example, let's say Oblivion.

420
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,400
When you buy the retail copy of Oblivion, that would be a macrotransaction.

421
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:35,480
When you buy add-on content that is cheaper than the purchase of the game, that is a microtransaction.

422
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,520
I would think that buying the system would be the macrotransaction.

423
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,720
I cannot believe we're having an argument.

424
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,400
Would be a neutral transaction.

425
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,840
And 2.

426
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Fight!

427
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,760
It was a neutral transaction, then.

428
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,880
This is the Semantics webcast.

429
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,960
Let me be exchanged.

430
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,840
GS68 in our chatroom says, buying a PS3 equals a macrotransaction.

431
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,080
That's like a super macro suck transaction.

432
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
Alright.

433
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,120
Sorry, ring the bell.

434
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
It's a major transaction.

435
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,240
Sorry, I made a little dig on the PS3.

436
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,080
Alright, so that's everybody's gaming week.

437
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Yes, we've hit everybody.

438
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
Alright.

439
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,680
Let's get into housekeeping tonight, and of course tonight is episode number 250.

440
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Yay.

441
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
Yay!

442
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,440
We didn't do anything special tonight, really, except have a lot of guests here, because

443
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,720
we don't want to celebrate ourselves more than once in a year, because that's just,

444
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,240
I don't know, that's too much ego.

445
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,200
Like once a year is acceptable, and we did that with our five-year anniversary show,

446
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,800
but if we were to kind of like promote, hey, it's episode 250, everybody should congratulate

447
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
us again.

448
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,420
That's like celebrating your anniversaries with your spouse or something every month

449
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,420
or something.

450
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,420
It's like our 13-month anniversary.

451
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,420
Yeah, awesome.

452
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,420
Exactly.

453
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,420
That's what it is.

454
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,320
After a while, it's just like, eh, whatever.

455
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,280
So yeah, this is just an eh, whatever episode of Orange Island Radio, but we do have some

456
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,840
special stuff tonight.

457
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,360
We actually have Insanist is one of our correspondents in Seattle.

458
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,840
He's actually, since he lives in Seattle, he's at the World Cyber Games this weekend,

459
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,040
and he actually called us a little earlier today to say this.

460
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Hello, Orange Island Radio.

461
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,480
This is Insanist reporting live from Seattle, Washington here Sunday, October 7th, 2007.

462
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,400
I'm calling to let you know that you missed out on some extraordinary goings on here at

463
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
the World Cyber Games.

464
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,320
For those of you not familiar, the Olympics of video games.

465
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,200
There were people from 74 countries, 700 gamers playing 12 different games, ranging from Command

466
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,120
and Conquer 3 all the way to a huge favorite, StarCraft.

467
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,280
Lots of huge upsets, which my partner and kind of DJ Tyrant will get to you later about.

468
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm telling you that this is something you don't ever want to miss.

469
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,960
It's a one of a kind event, meeting people from all sorts of countries at the press events,

470
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,960
at press tournaments, everything.

471
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:03,880
I actually, probably the funniest thing at any sort of tournament or competition I tried

472
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:11,720
to enter, I lost to somebody from another country every single time.

473
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,480
But just being able to take in all the cultural aspects, but just being here as one, all as

474
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,680
gamers, just having a good time was great.

475
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:26,320
Seeing people play, rock bands from different countries, and yes, I did hear somebody from

476
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,480
China try to sing Black Hole Sun, and it was kind of funny, but that's very mean, but it

477
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,240
was a great, great event.

478
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,840
The next one is in Cologne, Germany, so any new European listeners to Orange on Radio,

479
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,920
I recommend you take the trip out and go.

480
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,560
DJ Tyrant and I are actually thinking about going, so maybe we'll see you there.

481
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,860
But more, excuse me, I'm walking about downtown Seattle as I do this.

482
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,760
But for Orange on Radio, I'm insane as, to hear more about this, listen to our show The

483
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:05,000
Insanist Hour featuring SDFU every Thursday at 7.30 Pacific time, until then, I'm Insanist,

484
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
take care.

485
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,320
Thank you very much Insanist for your little report there from the World Cyber Games, he

486
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,640
was raving about it, like he was calling me literally every day about something that was

487
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,140
going on, he called me the other day, he's like, hey Rob, I got to play one of the other

488
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:24,000
all-game shows in some press competition, and I beat him, and I was like, go, you sound

489
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
like you're having a lot of fun.

490
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,640
One of the games was ChromeHounds because I think it was Madden, so I was, I don't think

491
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,280
he was actually playing all games interactive, I think he was playing one of the other shows

492
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,920
there, I want to say it was Game Addict Hotline.

493
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:44,420
Really the real losers of ChromeHounds would be anyone that bought the game, unfortunately.

494
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,440
Now Loki, if I heard you right during the tape segment there, you were dissing World

495
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,120
Cyber Games a little bit, what's your issue?

496
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
I think it's stupid.

497
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
Why?

498
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,680
I mean it's cool that I guess a bunch of people come together, but don't refer to it as like

499
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,640
the fucking Olympics or anything like that, I mean, seriously, to me the World Cyber Games

500
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,600
kind of reminds me of like the professional gaming leagues and shit like that, I fucking

501
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,800
hate those, I really do, that's like trying to launch the fucking XFL, I mean it's retarded,

502
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,520
no one's going to want to watch you play games, don't broadcast it, it's boring.

503
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,280
The XFL was actually kind of fun.

504
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,520
It's kind of weird because I know in like, I guess it's Korea, they have professional

505
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:29,840
gamers that make a lot of money for the spectator, but you're saying that it's not a spectator

506
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,600
type of deal, but it kind of is, it just depends on what region you're in.

507
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,920
If you've ever watched that stupid show that was on G4 a while back, Arena, it was the

508
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,120
most boring thing to watch.

509
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Well the problem was the way they put it together, they picked up kids off the street and tried

510
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,360
to make it all like, rad.

511
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,480
Well the problem is I think they really need to, if they're going to do something like

512
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,000
this, any design games that are meant for this type of gameplay or anything like that,

513
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,840
like Unreal Tournament or something, where you could actually set it up like, film it

514
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:07,920
like you're doing an actual football or sporting event type of game, just something like that.

515
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,960
Because flipping between people's screens and watching people do stuff, no one really

516
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,360
cares and it's kind of dumb.

517
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,600
I mean I guess it's cool if you're there at a DDR tournament or something like that, if

518
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,800
you're there and participating and watching, that's cool, but as far as broadcasting it

519
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,560
around the world, I don't think anyone cares.

520
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,880
It's kind of sort of like how people like to watch football and stuff, actually being

521
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,360
in the bleachers and watching the game as opposed to watching it on TV.

522
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,960
Well even on TV though, at least, it's sort of interesting.

523
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,560
If you watch it on TV you can turn it off.

524
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:47,360
It doesn't take much to go, oh look at me, I'm fast at the reflexes, who cares, it doesn't

525
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,760
take much to really build yourself up.

526
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,680
I know a lot of people that are fascinated with watching people play video games.

527
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,080
Yeah, we've all got that friend that's like, hey you want to play, no I'll just watch.

528
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,640
It's like, oh okay, and they're like having a good time watching you, like Rice Princess,

529
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,240
she's like, I'm going to watch you.

530
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,760
That's like my roommate, he doesn't really play video games, but he's always kind of

531
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,040
like, hey aren't you going to play Eternal Sonata again?

532
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,560
I kind of want to know what happens.

533
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,760
Why did you quit at Chapter 5?

534
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,960
I like doing cooperative gaming, not like where both of you are actually playing the

535
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,280
game, but like what Dan and I used to do, where he would, when we played Resident Evil,

536
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,600
he would play through the game and I would go off the strategy guide or tell him where

537
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
to go.

538
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Aw, bonding time.

539
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
That's all storyline stuff.

540
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,240
You want to know what happens in the storyline and stuff like that.

541
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,000
That's a little different than saying, oh I want to watch you because you're so lead

542
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
at fucking Halo.

543
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You know what I mean?

544
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,960
I don't, that's a little different.

545
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,560
It's not like, I was watching Halo for the storyline, but then it stopped making sense.

546
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,960
I mean seriously, it's different.

547
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Is there even a storyline?

548
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,720
You're tuning in for like the story and not for the actual gameplay.

549
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
I don't know why Halo 3 bothered with the story for real because I was playing co-op

550
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,200
mode the other day and like, you know, we're walking through and what have you and we're

551
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,440
shooting aliens, we're having a fun time.

552
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,200
I'll tell you what, Halo 3 co-op mode is awesome.

553
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,720
We're going through it and then suddenly Cortana's like, find me, you gotta find, I'm like, bitch,

554
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,720
get off the screen!

555
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,640
Wow, you got like so straight for a second there, that was like scary.

556
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,280
And here's the funny thing about that, Rob, since I haven't played any of the other games,

557
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,200
I don't understand the significance of finding her in the first place.

558
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,120
I'm like, it's just a fucking computer, just let it go, come on, seriously.

559
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,040
I thought she got exploded.

560
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,640
Buy a new chick, I mean seriously.

561
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,520
I don't know.

562
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,360
See I lost a little something for not playing the other games, but I digress.

563
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,360
So anyway, wow, really quickly though, people, what about the calls where people are like,

564
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,480
I want to see DDR in the Olympics or that whole thing.

565
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
No!

566
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
You are stupid!

567
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Wait, hold on, hold on.

568
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Oh my god.

569
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,600
What about this as an outlet for those people that want to see that?

570
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,240
I mean, there are people that want to do gaming as a competitive sport and, you know, people

571
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,280
that feel that, you know, why should gaming be any different from other sports that are

572
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
outdoors?

573
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,800
You know what, if you want to have gaming as a competitive sport, just do PVP mode on

574
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Ragnarok.

575
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,800
End of story.

576
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:10,560
Congratulations everybody, DarkSakura has leveled down the show, good job.

577
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Heart.

578
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Chat time.

579
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
Yes.

580
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
Oh, I got the finger.

581
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,240
Why don't you put that finger up so the Op11 people can see it on the cam, there you go.

582
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Alright.

583
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,960
Going to the chat room, because god, we haven't been paying attention to chat, I'm so sorry

584
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
folks.

585
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Chat.orangewater.com.

586
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Macmanbabykicker.

587
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
I don't know, why would you kick babykicker?

588
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,840
Okay, Shane.

589
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,760
Macman says, Cortana is significantly less hot in Halo 3, so therefore she doesn't deserve

590
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
to be saved, apparently.

591
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,760
She wasn't hot in the first Halo.

592
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,400
She's not real.

593
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,920
DDRDollarBill says, no DDR in the Olympics.

594
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
I found that ironic.

595
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,360
If she was a real chick or something, it might make more sense that you're trying to save

596
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,720
her, but she's a fucking computer program.

597
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
TigerClaws.

598
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Make a copy.

599
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,680
Hey, don't copy that floppy.

600
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,520
TigerClaws says, video games are becoming a spectator sport.

601
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,120
Son of Dad says, didn't they broadcast some of the fighting game championships recently

602
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
in Japan?

603
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,120
See, that's Japan.

604
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,240
They put weird shit on their TV, and you know what though, I respect them for that, because

605
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,040
there's some cool shit on there.

606
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,280
If only they'd fucking fill G4 full of all that cool shit in Japan, might be willing

607
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,600
to watch that channel.

608
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
They try, but they ban.

609
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
So yeah.

610
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
I mean, okay.

611
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
DarkShy brings up a good point.

612
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Yes, please.

613
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
I've seen King of Kong.

614
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
It's very interesting.

615
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,520
Yeah, DarkShy says they have a movie, they had a movie called King of Kong, by the way.

616
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,840
It was about the, it was Twin Galaxies.

617
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Oh, they're bullshit.

618
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Right.

619
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,720
And the guy, there was another guy who had completely trashed the guy that they put on

620
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Twin Galaxies score, and it was a big drama.

621
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,480
Actually, I would suggest to everybody, watch through King of Kong.

622
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,720
Well, see now, that's a good example, because people got really into that, and people, now

623
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,080
I haven't seen the movie yet, but from what I've heard, people really get into it, and

624
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,600
they're like rooting for one guy over the other guy.

625
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,400
You know, that's, what about that for your whole argument where people don't want to...

626
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
And to Ekem in...

627
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
It's like Tommy.

628
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,080
Now to Ekem in the chat room, the DDR show did not count.

629
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,840
Hold on, you've got to read what they said before you respond to it.

630
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,080
Hello, Radio 101.

631
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,000
Ekem in the chat says, what did he say?

632
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Now I lost it.

633
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,600
Oh yes, do I need to remind you of that crap DDR show on TV, to which you say, it doesn't

634
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
count.

635
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Why not?

636
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,400
Because, at first it was called Dance Revolution, and all it was was just fucking Mickey Mouse

637
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,340
Club ripoff with the slumber party girls.

638
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,340
Where are they now?

639
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,340
Oh, that's right.

640
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,800
No one's listening to them.

641
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,320
Aw, how sad.

642
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,200
So sad, yet another girl group gone.

643
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Aw.

644
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
All right.

645
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,020
Anyhow, let's, other housekeeping, real quick, I've got to say this, remember how last week

646
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,800
we got a lot of phone calls on Digital Life, I even had to hang up on one caller over drama

647
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,800
and all that stuff.

648
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,600
Well, SSJ Matt, one of our listeners, was kind enough to send us a care package from

649
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Digital Life.

650
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,560
So we got stuff from Digital Life.

651
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,640
So we, yeah, we have this little squeeze brain.

652
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,000
I have like 50 of those.

653
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
For Glee Max.

654
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,160
Well then, Eddie seemed to be interested in that, so there you go, Eddie.

655
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Let's see what we have here.

656
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,800
We have a seven day free trial of Lord of the Rings Online.

657
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
You want that?

658
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
No.

659
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
I don't have an Xbox.

660
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
It's not for Xbox, it's PC.

661
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Oh yes.

662
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Do you have a DVD Rom?

663
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
That's okay.

664
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
It's not a very good game.

665
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
There you go.

666
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
I don't have a PC.

667
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,160
There was supposed to be an MMORPG, Lord of the Rings for Wii, but I think they trucked

668
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
it.

669
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
All right, you're cut off from prizes.

670
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Ah.

671
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Eddie, there you go.

672
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,160
This little flashlight, it says UMA on the side, a little flashlight.

673
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,040
I'll take it, because I could use a flashlight.

674
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
I don't think it works.

675
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
I have my battery.

676
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,440
It's an on-working flashlight.

677
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Hello.

678
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,000
Look at this, all these VRares for DDR Universe.

679
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll take one.

680
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,520
Wait, is that the original universe or the second one?

681
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
No, it's the original universe.

682
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
DDR Universe.

683
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,520
I'll take one anyways.

684
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
All right.

685
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,520
I think I might have one, but I'd take one anyway.

686
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Well, here you go.

687
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,520
And there you go.

688
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
This is exciting radio.

689
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
Look at this.

690
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Party gift for us.

691
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,520
Oh my God.

692
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,520
Are we going to joke?

693
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
I was going to joke.

694
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Is there presents for the turn of 50?

695
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
And here they are.

696
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,180
Now this I might keep and give away at some point, because this is old.

697
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,000
This is a DDR Max sampler from Toys R Us.

698
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I don't think they even make these anymore.

699
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That's the way they want.

700
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So we'll hang on to that.

701
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,320
Did you want a universe sampler puppy?

702
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
No.

703
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,320
All right, there you go.

704
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,320
Everybody wins.

705
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
Here at Orange On Radio.

706
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
I got a brain.

707
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Let's see, what else do we have here?

708
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
You know, I...

709
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Oh, Loki's going to love this.

710
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
There's no money.

711
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,160
I emailed McNamara to send me some free shit, and he still has an email.

712
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Look at this.

713
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Here it is.

714
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Here it is, though.

715
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Authentic Eye of Judgment cards.

716
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Look at this.

717
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,440
This is a card for the biolith bomber from the Eye of Judgment.

718
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,600
Check that shit out right there.

719
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,760
It even says right on the back, the Eye of Judgment.

720
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
I'll take one.

721
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Wait, wait, wait.

722
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
What?

723
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
I'm going to make a copy of this.

724
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,520
All right, you do that.

725
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,880
Oh my God.

726
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,000
That would be so impossible to copy.

727
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Oh, wait.

728
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,080
No, it won't be.

729
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,080
A little doggy keychain there from Sirius Satellite Radio.

730
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,080
A puppy should have that.

731
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
Yeah, it is a puppy.

732
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,400
So a puppy gets the puppy keychain.

733
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,640
There you go.

734
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
And let's see.

735
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,400
Oh, some post-it notes from Newegg.

736
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,360
Who wants post-it notes from Newegg?

737
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Dark Soccer does.

738
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,360
Posties.

739
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,360
There you go.

740
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
And, oh, I like this.

741
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,360
What is this?

742
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,360
This is a little...

743
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
What is this?

744
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
An iPod mini skin?

745
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,800
Oh, is that from iSkin?

746
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,160
I don't know what this is.

747
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,900
I can't tell.

748
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,540
Is it an eraser?

749
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
What is it?

750
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,960
It looks like an eraser.

751
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,160
Okay.

752
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,400
And last but not least, last but not least, a lollipop with a ghost on it from Pac-Man.

753
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
There you go.

754
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
Who wants a lollipop?

755
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Oh, that's adorable.

756
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Don't anybody eat that.

757
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
We'll just keep it forever and ever.

758
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
It's our new mascot.

759
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
There you go.

760
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,680
It is, totally.

761
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,920
Thank you, SSJ100 Matt, for the fabulous gifts and prizes.

762
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Appreciate it.

763
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,600
Thank you.

764
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,240
There is no way that these things will not be able to, you know, not be copied.

765
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
These are...

766
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,840
Puppy figured out what it is, the other little thing.

767
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
It's a...

768
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,720
I think it's an advertisement for one other company that makes iPod skins called Jelliskins,

769
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,400
but they didn't actually put a real one on there.

770
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,080
It's just a piece of plastic that looks like an iPod with a fake one around it and something

771
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,640
on the back that says, take this to the booth and get two for one or something.

772
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,120
Well somebody forgot to take it to the booth, so we get it now here in studio.

773
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,680
Thank you for the prizes from Digital Life.

774
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
We appreciate it.

775
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
I think I'm going to peel this off.

776
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Alright.

777
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,680
What are you...

778
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,720
Oh, alright, anyway.

779
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,880
I guess that's it for housekeeping tonight.

780
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,840
Finally, I think we're only about 35 minutes into tonight's show and we can finally get

781
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
into some gaming news!

782
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Yay!

783
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,840
Grat!

784
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,880
Alright, we're starting with ding.

785
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,940
So there is some interesting rumors going around about a brand new Wii SKU and everyone's

786
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,120
all like, oh my god, what is this?

787
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,360
It's DVD or something, it's going to be playing.

788
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
No, don't get excited.

789
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,880
It's really nothing actually.

790
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,840
The brand new UPC or new pack as it's being dubbed, all it really is, and I've seen this

791
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,720
happen on a few different consoles, it's just them changing the box art.

792
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,920
Basically those launch games, they're a little old and dusty right now, time to put the new

793
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,280
shit on there to get people excited.

794
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
That's all it is.

795
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,280
Ooh, box art!

796
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
Oh my god!

797
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:23,880
Because they did the exact same thing in September with the PS2 Slim, they did the same thing

798
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:34,120
with the PSP, the fat system back in June, and it happens all the time, so just don't

799
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
get excited.

800
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Calm down.

801
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,360
If you're getting excited, you're like, oh my god, they're finally going to release the

802
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,360
pink Wii.

803
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,320
You're like, get over it, no.

804
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,740
Trust me, they're not releasing any more colors because they're still not having trouble selling

805
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,840
the original system.

806
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,440
They can't make enough.

807
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,280
When it starts to slow down and people stop buying them, that's when the new colors will

808
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
come.

809
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,640
That's like at GameStop, if you buy a new DS, they're giving away a Zelda frame that's

810
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,640
made of cardboard, and I'm like, I have a DS, and he's like, but it's super rare, and

811
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,960
I'm like, so are the $120 to buy a new DS.

812
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,040
Good times.

813
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,340
Not really.

814
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,800
You wanted to punch him, didn't you?

815
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,360
It just depends what GameStop you walk into, because honestly, I walked into a GameStop

816
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,040
once, and I was like, I want to get Elibits, because it came out today, and I hear good

817
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
things about it.

818
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
I want to buy Elibits.

819
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,240
He's like, did you pre-order it to get the little free stuffed Elibit?

820
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,240
And I was like, no, I didn't, and he said, okay, well, here's one anyway.

821
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
I was like, woohoo.

822
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,480
I pre-ordered Phantom Hourglass, and they said, oh yeah, there's a swag bowl of love.

823
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
There's no swag for that.

824
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
I was like, ah.

825
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,480
Well, I went back to the same store when Eternal Sonata came out, because I neglected to pre-order

826
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,200
that, and I wanted the free faceplate.

827
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,600
So I went in there, and I was like, yes, I'd like to get a copy of Eternal Sonata, and

828
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,280
I was like, oh, I forgot to pre-order, and they were like, oh, well, we have one copy

829
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
of the game left.

830
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Here you go.

831
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
And I'm like, what about the faceplates?

832
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
They're like, does anyone have an iPod?

833
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,960
Because I bet with an Exacto knife, I can make this into an actual skin.

834
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,360
Darkstalker actually got the thing off of the iPod.

835
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
Now it's just a piece of plastic.

836
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
What?

837
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
I didn't get anything.

838
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,960
Wait, no, I'm mixing up the fake radio names, sorry.

839
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,660
I think this is like duct tape.

840
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,760
It's printed duct tape.

841
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,960
This is wonderful radio, you taking apart one of our three little things.

842
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,480
Awesome sounds there doing that.

843
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,360
Well, hey, Eddie, you're very sad that you can't get anything free from buying Zelda.

844
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,600
You can get this as a Wii owner.

845
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,120
Nintendo is now giving away a Wii remote jacket.

846
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
That's right.

847
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,160
This week, Nintendo put out a press release that now there's this new sleeve that's coming

848
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,680
out for the Wiimotes, and let me start off by saying it's really ugly.

849
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,000
You know what's better?

850
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,600
Because Nerf did the same thing, and Nerf actually looks cool.

851
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,760
It basically makes your Wiimote look like an Egyptian mummy.

852
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:53,560
I don't know, I'd say it looks more like they're trying to retard-proof the controller.

853
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,000
Yeah, basically this is so that when you accidentally throw it at your TV because you're an idiot,

854
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
it will bounce.

855
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,240
Or somebody else is like, so you don't hit people in the head with it.

856
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
I'm like, what?

857
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,760
Well, I noticed all the padding is on the front of it, so obviously it's for projectiles

858
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,400
flying against it.

859
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Wow, you'll Wii your eye out.

860
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,400
These are going to be shipped with all new Wii consoles, Wii remotes, and of course copies

861
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,760
of Wii Play, because the Wiimotes come with them, starting October 2nd, and so that means

862
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,400
they should be on shelves by October 15th.

863
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Oh!

864
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,960
Well, maybe that's what the new SKU is then, since it was for October 2nd.

865
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Uh, maybe.

866
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,860
No, but you can go to Nintendo.com, too, and get your own free one.

867
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,760
And then maybe that's the new box art is on the box that says, now with free Egyptian

868
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
tombs.

869
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,080
Here's going to be the best part, though, about it.

870
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,040
If it does ship with the Wii console and stuff like that, who's to say someone's actually

871
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
going to put it on their Wii remote?

872
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,160
Little shot there of Tutankhamen playing Wii Tennis.

873
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
And you know what?

874
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,000
That pretty much killed the market for those stupid Wii gloves now.

875
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,720
Son of Dad wants to know, do the Wii condoms have lubricant on them?

876
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Yes.

877
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,920
No, but they are ribbed for her pleasure.

878
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,000
Have these Wiimotes inspired some type of new sick fetish?

879
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
That's disgusting.

880
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Oh yeah.

881
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
What's wrong with you people?

882
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Alright.

883
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Uh, let's see, what else do we have here?

884
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Wii-o-preenism?

885
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,440
Um, apparently you can actually go to Nintendo.com, or you can give this number a call.

886
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:22,000
In fact, call it right now, see what happens, 1-866-431-8367 to place your order.

887
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,640
You can order them now, but the free sleeves won't ship until the week of October 15th.

888
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,580
Make sure to ask for them to be ribbed.

889
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,440
For her pleasure.

890
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,760
I want them ribbed for my pleasure, please.

891
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,060
Hold on a minute here.

892
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,760
Can somebody go grab my Wii so I can get the serial number off it?

893
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,920
I don't know if anybody's actually going to answer.

894
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,560
Thank you for calling Nintendo's Wii remote's jacket accessory offer line.

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,760

Para assistance en español o primen numero dos.

897
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,200
Yes, bring the whole Wii.

898
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,840
Thank you for calling Nintendo's Wii remote's jacket accessory offer line.

899
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
For assistance in English, press 1.

900
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Para assistance en español o primen numero dos.

901
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
Where's my number pad?

902
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
Where's my keypad?

903
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
There we go.

904
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:24,560
Thank you for calling Nintendo Consumer Services, this is

905
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
your number.

906
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,240
Did you already go online and try or is this your first attempt?

907
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
This is my first attempt.

908
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,960
It said I could call the number.

909
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,440
I was just checking because we have quite a few people who tried online and had some

910
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
difficulties.

911
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
That's why I was...

912
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,440
Ah, forget it.

913
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
I'm not going to bother with her.

914
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,440
That's so mean.

915
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Just go put this back.

916
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,440
She's going to belittle me?

917
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:58,000
Well, sir, I've got like the stupid type, so I don't have a chance.

918
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,200
What's wrong with you, moron?

919
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,360
Why don't you go on the website?

920
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:16,480
At least we know it works, though.

921
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,480
The whole chat room.

922
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
Let's see.

923
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,680
Drunami says, don't fucking disrespect the call center rep.

924
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
I'm not.

925
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,680
Okay.

926
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,680
You know what, Rob?

927
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,680
You know what, Rob?

928
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,680
What?

929
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
I worked in a call center for five years.

930
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,680
Yes.

931
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Yeah.

932
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
Don't disrespect the call center rep.

933
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
I'm not.

934
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
I trained for a call center.

935
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
I'm not disrespecting.

936
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
That is disrespectful.

937
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,600
What's the point if you tried online or not?

938
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Did you try online?

939
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,080
Because really, I don't want to help you right now.

940
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,840
If you could just try online, that would make my life a whole lot easier so I wouldn't have

941
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,840
to do my job.

942
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,680
I often do stuff like that because when you work in a call center, you usually have a

943
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,760
time limit on how long you can take a call or else you get written up.

944
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
Hey, Rob.

945
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Hey, Mike Lit.

946
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
All right.

947
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Wonder.Carol said that call center rep was actually nice.

948
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
She was, but she was totally...

949
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
No.

950
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Well, she gave you explanations.

951
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,120
They probably make her ask that.

952
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
It was scripted.

953
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
Yeah.

954
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
You can tell what scripting sounds like.

955
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,120
Yeah.

956
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,120
All right.

957
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Rob.

958
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Yeah.

959
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
Yeah.

960
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
All right.

961
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,120
Let's just move on with the show already.

962
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,680
First of all, Rob, never give me kettle corn again.

963
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,360
It's got cocaine in it.

964
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,760
So anyway, virtual console for the UK if anyone's interested, and the first one makes me just

965
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,240
totally go WTF even though I actually own the original of this game.

966
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,360
Fatal Fury for Neo Geo, 900 Wii points.

967
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
Whoa.

968
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,080
Next to nine euro, 675 pound.

969
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,880
Yeah.

970
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,720
It's a Neo Geo game.

971
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,040
It's Fatal Fury.

972
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
Next.

973
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,200
Hey, look.

974
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,560
Streets of Rage 3, which is actually a pretty good game.

975
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
I like this.

976
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,920
I miss the old beat them up games like that, although nothing was ever as awesome as Battletoads

977
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,400
and Double Dragon.

978
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:02,360
Then moving forward, as soon as it decides to load, Golden Axe 3 at 800 Wii points, which

979
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:08,640
was also, as it was known in the UK, Sega Mega Drive, which for us was the Genesis.

980
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,180
And remember, Genesis does what Nintendo don't.

981
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:17,920
And also another Mega Drive game for 800 Wii points, Super Thunder Blade, which actually

982
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,400
wasn't all that fun.

983
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,480
And last but not least, Land Stalker, the Treasure of the King Knoll, no Treasure of

984
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,360
King Knoll, another Mega Drive game, which I don't actually think was fun either.

985
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,960
End of story.

986
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Alright.

987
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Anyways.

988
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:42,920
So, some day, there will be some more titles for the WiiWare service, because right now

989
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,680
all there is is a couple channels for the Wii, but one title promised for early 2008

990
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:56,080
is going to be a game called Gravitronics, being put out by developer Metaverse.

991
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:01,080
And it's going to be a game, I guess, supporting up to eight players, and I guess it's going

992
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,800
to be assaulting enemy territories using shapes.

993
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
Sweet.

994
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,720
So, death by shapes.

995
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,320
What is the deal with that whole, because I'm, speaking as a Nintendo fanboy, they were

996
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,180
supposed to have all this stuff ready to go at launch.

997
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,200
And it's like a year later, they're still doing three games a week, and there's like

998
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,200
literally hundreds of games between these three systems.

999
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,680
Or Eddie, did you try going online and filling out the form to ask the question, because

1000
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,680
I should, huh?

1001
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,720
I should call them up and be like, bitch!

1002
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
Well, okay.

1003
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,920
Here's one thing that, a lot of the games, first off, weren't rated by the ESRB, so a

1004
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,400
lot of those had to go through that again.

1005
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:43,280
A lot of them also, they have to be made to work with the emulators, and stuff like that.

1006
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,440
And then also, they don't give a fuck what you care!

1007
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,120
They're just like, we're fucking Nintendo!

1008
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,840
You can't buy our fucking system!

1009
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,480
Why the fuck do you want to get online anyways?

1010
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,920
You need to get your fucking system first before you can get fucking online!

1011
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,920
No I know the semantics, but.

1012
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,720
I don't think you should do a free fuck that much, they'll probably make up their own words.

1013
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,720
Like fiddlesticks.

1014
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Anyway.

1015
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
What the fuck?

1016
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,480
No, really, what it comes down to is that they're just dragging their fucking feet until

1017
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,040
they can get shit done.

1018
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,120
Where's this WiiWare service that's supposed to be coming out years from now, I mean seriously,

1019
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
when's it coming out?

1020
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
We want some actual games.

1021
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,920
How about better online service altogether?

1022
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Exactly.

1023
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
Actually support online.

1024
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Nintendo online?

1025
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
Exactly.

1026
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,520
It's such a scary world, that online out there, I mean.

1027
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,720
No cause you know, the upper browser's awesome, I like doing that on my TV, but there's really

1028
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,960
nothing else for Nintendo online, it's like, ahh!

1029
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,960
I mean there should be.

1030
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,160
I can't believe it's taken them this long to even come this close to being online, given

1031
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,100
that we've had the internet since you know, the late 70s, that you know, the government

1032
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,100
used it.

1033
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,440
They are seriously scared of like lawsuits, I think that's what it's coming down to because

1034
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,240
they're afraid if they make an online service that there's going to be some kid that's going

1035
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,320
to get lured by some rapist or something, and then oh my god, Nintendo caused the kid

1036
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
to get raped.

1037
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
Oh no.

1038
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,040
Just like the fucking um, Wii jacket shit, I mean there's no reason that they need to

1039
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,040
improve stuff.

1040
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,400
They really see idiotic people throwing shit through their god damn TV, and now you have

1041
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,520
this like stupid like foam shit on the like fucking remote that's going to, I guess, protect

1042
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,520
your TV.

1043
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,520
No.

1044
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,520
The hell it will.

1045
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,960
People will find more ways to do this, until this like stupid thing that the Wii's going

1046
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,440
to sit in, the remote, it's going to be like this giant foam protective thing that's going

1047
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,640
to look like you're waving around a giant retarded glove or something.

1048
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,400
I mean seriously, there are idiotic people, they just need to get over that fact and just

1049
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,680
start making better shit.

1050
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,880
How should Nintendo be responsible for somebody else's idiocy?

1051
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,440
There's no amount of like protection that they're going to be able to give for these

1052
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,320
remotes to cause people not to break the tag.

1053
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,360
I love the tag, you should actually hold on to the Wiimote.

1054
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:56,420
Is that even if somebody does, you know, completely disregard an instruction that is blatantly

1055
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,840
written on the product?

1056
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,480
Like five minutes before every game starts, it's like, be careful, the Wiimote, ah.

1057
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,080
Well, I have an example for you and this doesn't necessarily have to do with a video game,

1058
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:13,160
but this is a primary example of how somebody can still basically bypass an entire law to

1059
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,520
get money out of a company is there was a, and I studied this in my business law class,

1060
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,940
so this is back to business law.

1061
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,760
This person had a weed whacker and it said children under the age of so and such should

1062
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,920
not be allowed anywhere near it, do not swing it back, do not do this, the company is not

1063
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,120
responsible if this is the circumstance.

1064
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,500
Well, this kid was following his uncle around following this weed whacker and it bounced

1065
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,320
off of a rock, which was not a fault of the machine, it was physics.

1066
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,880
Reach back and cut off this kid's leg.

1067
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:52,340
And all of the things led up that it was operator error.

1068
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,440
It was full operator error, it was not the fault of the product and they disregarded

1069
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,440
all the things.

1070
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,080
However, they managed to get somewhere close to two million out of the company.

1071
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,040
And so I use that as my primary example, you know, if Nintendo wants to be careful then

1072
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,180
more power to them, you know, because they're going to find ways to bleed them dry if something

1073
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,180
like that happened.

1074
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,180
All right.

1075
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,400
In the interest of keeping the show under four hours tonight, we've got to move on to

1076
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,400
the next story.

1077
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,600
All lots of good points tonight, but we've got to keep it moving.

1078
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,080
When we talk about Halo DS, a lot of folks when they first heard about this game, this

1079
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:27,240
has got to be a bunch of bullshit, but this video came out this week that actually shows

1080
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,240
Halo DS in action.

1081
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,240
Listen to those noises there.

1082
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:38,220
It actually looks like Zanzibar there, somebody's getting shot the F up there in Zanzibar.

1083
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,460
So people are like, OMG, Halo DS was real at one point.

1084
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,360
This whole video came out from an IGN blog.

1085
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:49,240
Now here's the thing though, is that actually what happened is that apparently somebody

1086
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:54,820
was actually modifying an engine of another game to show that Halo DS could be done and

1087
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:00,000
Halo DS could be ported, and it was something that come as an idea like, hey, why don't

1088
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,040
you let us develop a DS port of Halo, to which the answer was a resounding no.

1089
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,160
Because of course, you know, at the time Bungie and Microsoft, you know, had their thing.

1090
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,160
And Halo's boring.

1091
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,960
Well, Halo's the only, you know, only on Microsoft consoles.

1092
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,480
So it couldn't really come to DS.

1093
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,320
Of course, as we're going to learn about a little later in the program, maybe now it's

1094
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,880
a possibility, but somehow I kind of doubt it.

1095
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,440
I mean the port, hey, props to the port though, the port looked pretty nice, I got to say.

1096
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,360
So that's that.

1097
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:32,400
You know, I actually, if they did it, I think that I would actually pay for it, honestly.

1098
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,120
If it had Wi-Fi network, it might be pretty cool and have the same multiplayer capabilities.

1099
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,920
That's what I think, although honestly, you know, I just wish for Duke Nukem 3D on DS.

1100
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,920
Heck yeah.

1101
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,840
Along with the text, with the voice macros.

1102
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,160
No, they do not need Duke Nukem 3D on the DS, they need to fucking finish Duke Nukem

1103
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,240
Forever and stop making excuses.

1104
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,600
Yeah, they're going to hold that over our heads like a carrot in front of a horse, so...

1105
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,040
That's fine, I've got Forever to wait for this damn game.

1106
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,040
They better come out.

1107
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,320
I don't care if it's going to suck.

1108
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:03,120
Well, for anyone who was looking forward to Super Smash Brothers Brawl, guess who's going

1109
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,000
to be in it?

1110
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,960
Lucas from Mother 3, which is about the same thing as us getting, you know, Roy when the

1111
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,960
last Smash Brothers came out because we didn't have any Fire Emblem then, so whatever.

1112
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,480
And now we're getting Ike, and now we're getting Lucas.

1113
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,600
So maybe they're going to go, oh, well let's pull a Fire Emblem and finally give them Mother

1114
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,600
3 since it's already in English!

1115
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,600
Nope.

1116
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,040
I'm just going to have to import my copy from the UK.

1117
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,040
Nope.

1118
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,520
Although I think that it's funny that Joystiq did a comparison between Lucas and Mother

1119
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,300
3 and Lucas and the Wizard.

1120
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,580
As long as Lucas still has the ability to do PK Fire and PK Cross and all that cheap

1121
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,440
bullshit then I'll be very happy.

1122
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:48,600
They should be one of those wireless communicators with Super Smash Brothers.

1123
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,720
Your mic is going crazy, Eddie, so we're going to unplug it and you're going to have to borrow

1124
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:55,000
one of the other mics from now on because the chat room is complaining about you.

1125
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's cutting in and out.

1126
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
They can't hear it.

1127
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
They can't hear it.

1128
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
You have to use another mic.

1129
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's on.

1130
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
This was on a commission.

1131
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Oh, darn.

1132
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Sorry, Eddie.

1133
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:10,360
Anyways, in other news, the Wii is not going to meet the demand for this holiday.

1134
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:15,840
So in case you were waiting for some magical delivery of Wii systems that was going to

1135
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,880
be able to put out millions and millions of units in the United States, think again, it's

1136
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,880
not going to happen.

1137
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:27,640
Reggie actually kind of originally claimed that there was going to be plenty of units

1138
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:33,440
out there but then went back to retract that statement and of course they're trying to

1139
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,200
up the quantities coming to the United States but still they're not going to be able to

1140
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,000
make it.

1141
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,840
I guess that's good that they're selling units.

1142
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:48,680
I think it's so crappy though that after a year of being out, they can't fucking produce

1143
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,000
more of these.

1144
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:59,680
I don't think that there's anything in them that's really that revolutionary.

1145
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,340
If you can find one, buy one.

1146
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:06,640
That's probably the recommendation, especially if you want to get one for Christmas.

1147
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:12,560
Hopefully there won't be all the camping out and everything that people have to do again

1148
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,560
this time.

1149
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:18,000
That would be kind of sucky, I don't know.

1150
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,520
There's been some titles announced for the Neo Geo ports on the Virtual Console because

1151
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,000
as you know, the Virtual Console is now going to be getting some Neo Geo games on it.

1152
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,540
One of the first games that's going to come out is Fatal Fury.

1153
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:37,700
Fatal Fury is only going to set you back $9, which is amazing when you consider that there's

1154
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:41,160
Fatal Fury Special on Xbox Live Arcade with extra stuff for $5.

1155
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,120
Yeah, but then again, I paid about $100 for the cart.

1156
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,700
So I guess everybody's getting a bargain in that case.

1157
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:53,100
Also you can look forward to upcoming other SNK fighting classics, World Heroes and Art

1158
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,440
of Fighting.

1159
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,920
And Art of Fighting was great because it has a character named after me.

1160
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,520
There's actually a Robert in the game, so I definitely recommend Art of Fighting.

1161
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,520
Good times.

1162
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,720
And it has that zoom in and out.

1163
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,720
And it has King.

1164
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,720
Hello.

1165
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:07,720
It does have King.

1166
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,720
King's hot.

1167
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,720
Who doesn't love King?

1168
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,720
King has a tux.

1169
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,720
She does.

1170
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,720
I know it's great.

1171
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:19,480
It said in her boobs, come out when you knock her out.

1172
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:25,800
Well other potential title coming out on the Virtual Console, at least the ESRB's put out

1173
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:33,320
ratings for it, is we have Echo Junior and Eternal Champions, which I love Eternal Champions,

1174
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,840
but I like Eternal Champions CD better with the Cinekills.

1175
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,520
That was so great.

1176
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:43,960
Sonic 3D Blast and Light Crusader also have ratings out on them.

1177
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,800
So yeah.

1178
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
Hooray.

1179
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,760
I want Vectorman.

1180
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,680
Oh my God, Vectorman.

1181
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,200
Well there's plenty other stuff coming out in the US this week.

1182
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:02,240
This week we're going to see releases of such wonderfully average games as Looney Tunes

1183
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:09,160
Acme Arsenal coming out on PlayStation 2, 360 and the Wii, Looney Tunes Duck Amuck on

1184
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:17,960
the DS, Mountain Bike Adrenaline, a game that's attempting to make mountain biking extreme

1185
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,960
or something.

1186
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,480
It's coming out on PlayStation 2.

1187
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:29,340
Honda SBK07, Superbike also coming out on PlayStation 2 and Backyard Football 2008.

1188
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,840
Why the fuck do they still make more of those games?

1189
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,160
Because they all suck.

1190
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:41,800
Also coming out this week on the DS, Jackass, which I recommend that one because it's awesome.

1191
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,800
FIFA Soccer 08 coming out on almost every single platform.

1192
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:51,000
On Xbox 360, Half Life 2, the Orange Box is going to be making its way out and also on

1193
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,400
the PC that will be coming out as well.

1194

1196
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,920
game coming out on the DS as well.

1197
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,920
Bleach No.

1198
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,140
Yes, the Blade of Fate coming out.

1199
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:17,600
Let's see here, Flipper Critters on the DS.

1200
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:22,560
Smash Detective 2.5, that one might be pretty interesting.

1201
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:32,400
Let's see here, also on PC we're getting Thrillville off the rails and on, let's see here, the

1202
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,560
Wii Mercury Meltdown Revolution.

1203
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,240
I believe that's everything.

1204
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,900
Oh, Folklore on the PS3.

1205
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,760
That one's actually looking like a pretty good game.

1206
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,640
It's gotten some pretty decent reviews as well.

1207
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:49,360
And Final Fantasy Tactics, War of the Lions coming out on the PSP.

1208
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,520
Ooh, that's supposed to be a good one.

1209
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,520
I'm looking forward to that.

1210
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,960
And then the last one, let's see here, Star Wars Battlefront Renegade Squadron on PSP

1211
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,960
as well.

1212
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,960
Good times.

1213
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,960
I do believe that's everything.

1214
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,440
Well, let's go over to Japan and check out the upcoming release dates over in Japan for

1215
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,640
this week on October 11th on the Xbox 360, Project Gotham Racing 4.

1216
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,560
We just got that over here this last week and now over here in Japan you get to check

1217
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,920
that out this week.

1218
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:17,680
And coming out on the PlayStation 3, Rise from Lair, which I believe is just their version

1219
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,040
of Lair, is coming out on October 11th as well.

1220
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,560
Also on the PlayStation 3, The Godfather, the Dawn's Edition.

1221
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,960
So if you're a fan of The Godfather in Japan, you get that.

1222
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:36,000
You've got to love this on the PlayStation 2, Colorful Aquarium, My Little Mermaid.

1223
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
This is not...

1224
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Dating sim.

1225
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,100
Yeah, this looks like some type of dating sim or something.

1226
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,080
This is not some aquarium like Tetris Splash or whatever.

1227
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,600
It's just a bunch of...

1228
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,600
It's a maid fetish game.

1229
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,400
Yeah, it's anime girls and maid costumes.

1230
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,400
There you go.

1231
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,400
With kitty ears.

1232
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,400
Exactly.

1233
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,400
You know.

1234
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,400
You know what we need wrong?

1235
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Otaku Boys Fap Away.

1236
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,400
We need another Tokimeki Memorial.

1237
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,400
Well, maybe you will someday.

1238
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,360
Coming out on the DS, Namco Museum DS with the letter N.

1239
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,360
Do what?

1240
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,840
With the letter N. How many freaking Namco Museum things do you have?

1241
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,280
Do you need another one on the DS?

1242
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,280
Yes.

1243
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,280
Do you?

1244
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,360
There's a DVD of these that's like every single Namco game ever made.

1245
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,360
For real.

1246
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,520
Looks like there's kind of a cool new version of Pac-Man on there.

1247
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,360
I don't know if that's Pac-Man Versus or what the hell it is.

1248
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,360
That is Pac-Man Versus.

1249
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,360
Is that really?

1250
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,360
Look at that.

1251
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,160
That's all right there on the Namco Museum of the DS.

1252
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,320
Good times.

1253
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:27,240
Also coming out on the DS, Tecmo is putting this game out and it looks like, I don't know,

1254
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,760
some type of like spy game or something there.

1255
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,760
I don't know if it's a point and click.

1256
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,880
Yeah, it might be a point and clicker.

1257
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,880
I'm not sure.

1258
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:33,880
But here's the name of it.

1259
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:43,920
DS Nishimura Kitoro Suspense Shintante Series Kyoto Atami Zekai no Kotou Satsui no Wanna.

1260
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,400
I no Wanna that game.

1261
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,760
I was looking at that and thinking of Snatcher.

1262
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,160
I don't know if it takes longer to beat the game or pronounce the title.

1263
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,400
So it's all right there.

1264
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,320
And on the Sony PSP, some movies come out for those of you guys that are still in the

1265
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:08,120
UMDs in Japan and you can buy this week on October 12th, Lady in the Water.

1266
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,960
Yes, the M. Night Shyamalan classic.

1267
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,560
And you can ogle those scrunts right there on the PlayStation 3.

1268
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,520
Hey, how about some more?

1269
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:23,640
That's the sound that I make when I'm taking Lady in the Water.

1270
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,120
Leaving sacrifices for the Lady in the Water.

1271
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,120
Wow.

1272
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,920
So shall I continue with the UK releases?

1273
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,480
Actually, really quickly, Alpha Canagram says, Skye, that is the Pac-Man that Miyamoto helped

1274
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,520
work on.

1275
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,600
So that's like the, I guess, newer Pac-Man game.

1276
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,680
Oh, in that case, let me buy another Pac-Man game.

1277
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:41,680
Whoo!

1278
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,960
That ain't stopped us.

1279
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:53,600
So on the 12th in the UK, Bliss Creek 2 Liberation on PC, Crash of the Titans on Xbox 360, Deadhead

1280
00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:00,320

1281
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:06,400
Episode 2, Heroes of Might and Magic 5, Tribes of the East, NBA Live 08, Portal, Project

1282
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:14,560
Gotham Racing 4, Race 07, the official WTCC game, whatever that is, Skate on PlayStation

1283
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:20,080
3, Spider-Man Friend or Foe, which I'm actually kind of looking forward to, Star Wars Battlefront

1284
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:27,840
Renegade Squadron on PSP, TAR Chronicles on PC, Team Fortress 2, and the Orange Box.

1285
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,080
I think I forgot to mention one.

1286
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:34,040
I think this week also Donkey Kong Bongo Blast is coming out on the Wii.

1287
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,800
I don't know if anyone should get excited about a game that was supposed to be on the

1288
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:41,960
GameCube featuring the Bongos and now is on the Wii because we needed another Wii game

1289
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,040
and it's a racing game.

1290
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,140
I'm excited.

1291
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,140
I tried.

1292
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,140
I tried, guys.

1293
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,140
I tried.

1294
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,160
I tried.

1295
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,160
I tried.

1296
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,160
I tried.

1297
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,160
Anyways.

1298
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,500
No, seriously though, there are some other interesting things happening including more

1299
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,600
Guitar Hero tracks being revealed.

1300
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:04,000
I swear to God there's no surprise when you go play Guitar Hero 3 nowadays, which by the

1301
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,900
way this is how Activision keeps Guitar Hero in the news every week and it's worked successfully.

1302
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,040
Every week there's some damn Guitar Hero 3 update.

1303
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,920
Well, there's only a couple more weeks until, you know, this game comes out, so.

1304
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:20,780
But there is some good stuff being announced, When You Were Young by The Killers, Same Old

1305
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:27,840
Song and Dance by Aerosmith, Helicopter by Block Party, Strichen by Disturbed, let's

1306
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:34,000
see here, Devil Went Down to Georgia, which I think that was on that leaked list as...

1307
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,800
I wonder if all these songs are on the leaked list.

1308
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:42,080
Yeah, so, ooh, maybe that leaked list is real, yeah, okay.

1309
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:50,780
Black Magic Woman by Santana, Hit Me With Your Best Shot by Pat Benatar, and The Seeker

1310
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,380
by The Who, and some other shit, so.

1311
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,280
Hit me with a wet sock.

1312
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,280
Come on!

1313
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:06,120
I don't know, it's how we used to sing it at karaoke.

1314
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,120
Me and my imaginary...

1315
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:11,200
Irene, don't say things if you don't have a microphone, seriously.

1316
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,960
You ruin the experience for the podcast listeners.

1317
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,960
Us as studio are amused.

1318
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,760
Anything else you want to announce on Guitar Hero 3?

1319
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,320
Nope.

1320
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,080
It's coming out on the 28th, in case you haven't heard, and that's a Sunday.

1321
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,080
Hooray.

1322
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:30,640
No, but seriously though, they're going to have to keep all the attention that they can

1323
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,600
possibly get, because about a month after that is when Rock Band comes out, and then,

1324
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,180
I don't know.

1325
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,240
You know, a friend of mine used to sing it on stage once, with me with your big cock.

1326
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,240
Come on!

1327
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,880
Is that your grandma too?

1328
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,920
No, that was not my grandma, you fucking bastard.

1329
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,800
Why is it funny when I read this?

1330
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,800
Alright.

1331
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,800
Alright.

1332
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,120
Anyhow, um, moving on.

1333
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,520
I will probably not be playing too much of Guitar Hero 3, because I'm too busy being

1334
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:05,040
addicted to MMOs, and one MMO that maybe I should really check out sometime, because

1335
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,320
I've heard a lot of things about it, City of Heroes.

1336
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,760
City of Heroes is actually going to be getting a new update called A Stitch in Time, where

1337
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,720
the heroes will get to go into a new universe, and get to relive some of the major events

1338
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:24,640
that have happened in the past to shape Paragon City, which is where all the City Heroes folks

1339
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,640
live.

1340
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,200
Oh my god, such a ripoff of Final Fantasy XI.

1341
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,860
Not really, because this is, no, no, I say no, because this is letting them relive events

1342
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,360
that, you know, the game's been on for years.

1343
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,360
I'm just kidding, I'm not serious.

1344
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,360
Both of them suck.

1345
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,360
Oh, okay, thank god.

1346
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,480
Yeah, like they're the first people to ever think of, you know, going back in time, seriously.

1347
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:46,000
There will be new power sets, including dual blades, willpower, new customization, weapons,

1348
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,840
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1349
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,200
City of Heroes fans are excited, I'm sure.

1350
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,640
However, I still have not checked out City of Heroes, but I've heard good things about

1351
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,640
Chat.

1352
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,640
Chat room, tell me about City of Heroes.

1353
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,640
Any of you guys play it?

1354
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,980
If so, what am I missing?

1355
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:05,080
I think that it's got, like, this thing where, um, I think it has, like, some sort of rotating

1356
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,800
experience thing.

1357
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:08,800
I don't know.

1358
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,920
I think the best part of that game would be creating your character.

1359
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,160
I could see myself sitting there for an hour in the create your character mode, and then

1360
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,160
that's it.

1361
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,400
And then at the end, Stan Lee remakes your costume.

1362
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,260
Yeah, exactly.

1363
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,260
And I get dismissed.

1364
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:26,640
I have to throw away my costume, because I'm not a true superhero, because I tried to kick

1365
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,640
the baby.

1366
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:34,640
Well, in other MMORPG news, and we all know that MMORPG means Many Men Online Roleplaying

1367
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,920
Girls, for those who are playing World of Warcraft, which I am not numbered among you

1368
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:46,840
since my computer died, I am playing better games, well, they have done their own version

1369
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:52,840
of Oktoberfest in World of Warcraft, Brewfest, which is really what Oktoberfest should be

1370
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:58,320
called anyway, don't you think, where you can run around in Lederhosen and eat pretzels

1371
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,120
in game.

1372
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,000
And listen to German Polka, which is awesome.

1373
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,360
You know what makes it even better is if you actually have significant amounts of alcohol

1374
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,540
there with you at your computer.

1375
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,720
You can actually get these things from little Brewfest vendors, and if you drink them, they

1376
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,400
actually give you buffs, they're useful items, but then they make your screen all wavy, and

1377
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,400
like, it fucks with you.

1378
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,600
Like, if you have a, you know, if, what, oh god, here comes Irene.

1379
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,160
How long have you been playing WoW?

1380
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,920
Because they have alcoholic drinks, like, from the inn.

1381
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,680
No, but this one's different, like, instead of making your screen blurry, this one made

1382
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,480
my screen, like, pulsate, it was really weird.

1383
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,000
Like, I've only ever drank the alcoholic drinks that make the screen blurry, and then they

1384
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
blur more and more as you drink them.

1385
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,200
Isn't that kind of sad, people that, like, drink alcohol in-game, it's like, I'm too

1386
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,200
scared to try it in my life.

1387
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,620
Well, everybody tries it once, I mean, come on.

1388
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,620
In-game, like.

1389
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,620
Well, yeah, because you want to see what your character's like drunk.

1390
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:47,080
Like, is this what it's really like, I'm never drinking ever again, like, that's pretty

1391
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,080
sad.

1392
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:53,320
No, I'll tell you what happens when you really drink in real life, is you get a bright idea

1393
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,960
to form an internet radio program with your friends, and then you can't escape it for

1394
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,600
over 250 weekly episodes.

1395
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,880
No, no, Rob, that's when you're bored on the Bart.

1396
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,280
No, when you get, when you get drunk, you marry Irene.

1397
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,600
No, no, no, that's, no, that's a joke.

1398
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,800
Eddie tells a funny joke and gets a test paper score.

1399
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,800
That's a joke.

1400
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,800
That's a joke from a party.

1401
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,240
Well, that's just funny after a conversation.

1402
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,840
No, Irene got married at a party when this guy was drunk, so.

1403
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,800
Yeah, his name's William.

1404
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,800
Okay.

1405
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,800
And he's Asian.

1406
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,400
Um, totally random sidebar conversation, it has nothing to do with gaming, but it needs

1407
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
to be told.

1408
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,680
Um, Jamie and I last night went to a movie, we went and saw that across the universe.

1409
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,680
It was great.

1410
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,680
The thing would be, you know, it was okay.

1411
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,680
It had good parts.

1412
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,320
But I didn't like the whole thing.

1413
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,320
Whatever.

1414
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,320
It's like a quilt.

1415
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,320
Some sections are nice, but the whole thing is ugly.

1416
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,480
He gave it the Xanadu rating, okay?

1417
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,680
Yeah, okay, anyway.

1418
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,560
That's not what we were talking about, but on the drive home, somehow the topic of going

1419
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,560
to Vegas came up.

1420
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,560
Who was always in the car?

1421
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,560
It was me, my roommate, my boyfriend, and you, right?

1422
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,560
My roommate.

1423
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,560
Yeah, my roommate.

1424
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,560
Our roommate is a doll in the car.

1425
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,560
And John.

1426
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,560
Yeah, my roommate.

1427
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,560
John.

1428
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,280
We were in the car, and we were taking about going to Vegas and wanting to go to Vegas.

1429
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:58,400
And we were talking about wanting to talk about... Because you know how like everybody's

1430
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,100
all... I think the topic of Britney Spears came up.

1431
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,380
Now you know how everybody's always talking about, oh, the sanctity of marriage?

1432
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:05,060
No, we were talking about the sanctity of marriage and we were bringing up examples

1433
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,060
of why there's no sanctity.

1434
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:09,000
You know, and those laws, and I don't mean to make it political, but whatever.

1435
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,640
The laws in those states pass, you know, marriage should always be a man and woman to protect

1436
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,020
the sanctity of marriage, you know?

1437
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,140
then we talk about Britney Spears gets married in an old within 48 hours.

1438
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:22,020
Excellent example of the sanctity of marriage at work, right?

1439
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,180
So we're talking about who would you go to Vegas and get married and

1440
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,100
then divorce right away.

1441
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,980
Like we were talking, let's go to, since we can't, since like us being gay,

1442
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,020
we can't marry each other, well, Jamie's already married, she can't remarry.

1443
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:35,060
But the rest of us are all gay, we can't marry each other.

1444
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:35,660
I can pretend.

1445
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,700
So we're gonna marry women and go to Vegas and

1446
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,180
just get married to a woman and then divorce.

1447
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,860
So they were saying, who should I marry?

1448
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,780
And then your name came up, Irene, as to somebody I should marry.

1449
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:49,540
And I was like, no, I don't even want to be married to her for an hour.

1450
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:52,540
Why do you look so sad?

1451
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,420
You could marry Eddie or something.

1452
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,900
I would marry Eddie.

1453
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,980
What? We're gonna get married when we're 30.

1454
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:00,100
Why did you look so shocked that I wouldn't marry you?

1455
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,180
Because you don't want to marry me.

1456
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,580
But it would be a dysfunctional marriage.

1457
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,940
I mean, it would be really bad.

1458
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,020
It would be really bad.

1459
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,500
Everybody wants to marry me, you're up, you're just-

1460
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,260
I had the bright idea of having a group wedding and then a group annulment.

1461
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:15,620
That's a great idea, we should do that right now.

1462
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:16,460
Forget the show.

1463
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,260
Rob, Irene's already married to somebody that you know, so.

1464
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:19,820
Well, really?

1465
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,060
Yeah.

1466
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,300
Did she marry my boyfriend when I wasn't-

1467
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,500
Yeah, exactly.

1468
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,500
Good job. And he does crazy things to her all the time.

1469
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,100
Are you putting out?

1470
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,620
According to him, she is.

1471
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,140
Well.

1472
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,700
Can you see the pictures on my MySpace?

1473
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,220
Well.

1474
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,020
Oh my gosh.

1475
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:33,580
Yeah, Irene.

1476
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,780
I mean, there's no pictures.

1477
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:35,460
What?

1478
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:36,660
Huh?

1479
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:37,580
I don't really know what,

1480
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:40,060
maybe it's because I've been drinking a little bit here in studio tonight.

1481
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,580
But yeah, that had nothing to do with games.

1482
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,300
Yeah, Irene-

1483
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,220
Why don't you be sitting over there doing like the,

1484
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,500
either the I've got to go to the bathroom dance or god damn it,

1485
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,740
can we talk about video games?

1486
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:50,460
Irene makes chocolate something that was on his shirt.

1487
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:57,460
I like grapes.

1488
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,340
Eddie brings the show to a screeching halt.

1489
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:00,100
Ten gamers score.

1490
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,020
Anyways.

1491
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:04,060
I also like beer.

1492
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,860
Beer is great.

1493
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,540
Beer makes this show possible.

1494
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:10,100
I'm sure I'm going to get some emails on that one.

1495
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:16,020
We got an email, we got emails in the past about me bashing on Sony and

1496
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:19,500
you know, and stuff like that and saying that we should do it less.

1497
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:23,900
But honestly, they make it so easy.

1498
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,460
I mean, really.

1499
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:31,500
Okay, for example, this mystical new 40 gigabyte PlayStation 3

1500
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:35,980
skew, which we had no idea was going to come out, is now made official.

1501
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,380
And you know, earlier this week there was rumors saying, oh,

1502
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:43,340
it's not going to be backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 games at all.

1503
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,900
And then people were like, oh no, of course it will be because, you know,

1504
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,540
they do it all via software emulation and that kind of stuff.

1505
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:51,620
Well, come to find out, guess what?

1506
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:55,260
It isn't backwards compatible with any PlayStation 2 games.

1507
01:05:55,260 --> 01:06:01,180
So they removed essentially a free part of the PlayStation 3.

1508
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,820
Just to fuck you all over again.

1509
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,900
So it is official for Europe.

1510
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,180
It's going to be coming out here pretty soon.

1511
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:11,700
It is not backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 titles at all.

1512
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:17,420
It will be coming out on October 10th for a price of 399 euros.

1513
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:22,260
And it will only have two USB ports instead of four, which is not a huge deal.

1514
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:26,540
And none of the multi-memory card ports, which is also not a real big deal.

1515
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:31,540
But come on, no backwards compatibility PlayStation 2 games?

1516
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:36,860
I mean, yeah, I'm sure that they'll be busy playing your entire library of

1517
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,620
games for the PlayStation 3.

1518
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,860
Why do you need PlayStation 2 games when you have Motorstorm and Lair?

1519
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,740
Oh, well, my mistake.

1520
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,180
Oh, you know, forgive me.

1521
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:49,700
So it's not even backwards compatible with patches on the hard drive?

1522
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,580
No, not at all.

1523
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:55,100
In fact, it is only, I guess it is backwards compatible PlayStation 1 games

1524
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,940
because they are part of the download network and I guess they have downloads

1525
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,060
for that stuff.

1526
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:01,940
But I don't understand what they were thinking.

1527
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:04,420
I mean, really, that is like crazy.

1528
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,740
The fact that it'll still do the PlayStation 1 games, I mean, and to play

1529
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:12,260
Devil's Advocate, one comment I've heard on this is, well, why is it such a big

1530
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,220
deal when you have a PlayStation 2 right there on the shelf?

1531
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,180
Do you really need it to play PlayStation 2 games?

1532
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:19,740
I say yes, because A, I know people who don't know PlayStation 2s.

1533
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:20,460
Imports.

1534
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:25,140
And B, PlayStation 2s sometimes break a while later.

1535
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:27,620
Well, but you can't play PlayStation 2 imports.

1536
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,260
They're not region free.

1537
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,620
I've seen them.

1538
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:31,100
On a Japanese PlayStation 3, you can.

1539
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:31,820
Nope.

1540
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:32,740
No, you can't.

1541
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,180
There's video proof out there, I'll tell you.

1542
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:39,780
You cannot play Japanese games on PlayStation 2s or PlayStation 3s of other

1543
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:40,220
regions.

1544
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:42,300
Only PlayStation 3 games are region free.

1545
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,500
Then the game might not have been coded.

1546
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:50,340
You know, it's just, it's really, really stupid.

1547
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:55,420
I don't know what the hell they were thinking, but hey, if you want to, you

1548
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:58,460
know, buy one of these, they will be available.

1549
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:00,820
I mean, save yourself some money, I guess.

1550
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:03,540
Maybe it's because they don't really want to cut the price on these.

1551
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:08,020
And this is their way of, I don't know, getting people to buy the, I don't

1552
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:08,260
know.

1553
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:11,700
I really, they're like, well, we're offering these cheaper skews, but it's

1554
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:14,180
even starting with the 20 gig PS3.

1555
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:17,460
It's like, well, we have this cheaper skew, but it's kind of, you know, a

1556
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,660
little bit gimped.

1557
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:22,740
So maybe just spend the extra $100 or whatever and buy the better one.

1558
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,300
You know, and it's kind of what they've been doing.

1559
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,860
It's like we're throwing out this crap car.

1560
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:30,540
It's like you can either choose this car with no wheels, no steering wheel, no

1561
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:36,180
airbags, and no gas tank, or you could buy this Ferrari.

1562
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:37,660
Which would you like?

1563
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:41,540
I love this comment in the chatroom from Escapist at chat.orangelandradio.com

1564
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,100
says, reactions to criticism.

1565
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,940
Nintendo gets angry.

1566
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:48,740
Microsoft is sorry and tries to fix the problem.

1567
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:52,980
Sony goes and pleasures itself in the corner while singing show tunes.

1568
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:56,780
OK, honestly, I mean, this, I don't know if this is officially coming over

1569
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,540
to the US yet, and so far it's not.

1570
01:08:58,540 --> 01:09:01,380
My fair lady, is that me?

1571
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:06,980
So far it's not, but I mean, really, clang, clang, clang goes the trolley.

1572
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:07,980
Let me put it this way.

1573
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:12,620
If you're really serious on getting the PlayStation 3, and you're waiting for

1574
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:18,300
Metal Gear Solid 4, Grand Theft Auto 4, Final Fantasy 13, I suggest you purchase

1575
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,660
the console closer to the time when these games come out.

1576
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:25,700
Because by then they're going to have about four other skews that will have

1577
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:32,060
varying degrees of crippled technology versus discount and stuff, and you can

1578
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:33,060
make a better decision.

1579
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:36,860
I mean, because honestly right now, spending the money to buy a crippled

1580
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:39,500
system is kind of stupid.

1581
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,500
And no people have been drawn to comparison, well, the core system doesn't

1582
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:46,260
allow you to play backwards compatible games right out of the box, yeah, but

1583
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:49,160
you can buy a hard drive for that later on, and then you can play backwards

1584
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,160
compatible games.

1585
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,160
This, you're fucked.

1586
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,060
So, I don't get it.

1587
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:56,540
I don't get why you would remove something that's free.

1588
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,860
It boggles my mind.

1589
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,580
I don't understand.

1590
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:06,220
I'm just a girl who can't say no, I'm in a terrible fix.

1591
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:17,540
I'm singing in the rain.

1592
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,380
This is great radio, you have.

1593
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:23,220
See, that is the camera, oh, the camera's not on.

1594
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:25,780
No, the cam shut off after 40 minutes.

1595
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:26,780
Anyway.

1596
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,860
But you know, I hear that there's going to be a new skew or something coming

1597
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:32,380
out over here with Spider-Man 3 bundled with it, so hey, at least you have a

1598
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:33,900
fucking Blu-ray player.

1599
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,660
There you go.

1600
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:40,100
Well, obviously, needless to say, this news makes us a little bit agitated,

1601
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,660
especially for those of us that were hoping to clear the space on the shelves,

1602
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:46,420
or maybe see some upscaled PlayStation 2, you know, that would have been kind

1603
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,820
of cool too, and have some places to go.

1604
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:48,820
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1605
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:52,180
Let me interrupt you real quick, because I forgot to add Sony's official

1606
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:56,340
comment to explain why they decided not to put backwards compatibility in

1607
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:57,340
there.

1608
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:02,620
It says, let's see here, there is sufficient choice in the marketplace,

1609
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:07,820
and that we're still better off using that money that we put into backwards

1610
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:12,100
compatibility, either investing in new games or using that money to help

1611
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,740
support bringing the price down.

1612
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:18,260
We have made it clear on many occasions that our priority is on

1613
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:22,300
developing innovative new features and services for the PlayStation 3, not

1614
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,660
on backwards compatibility.

1615
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:31,300
Okay, but they have it built into the firmware right now.

1616
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,980
Why remove it?

1617
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:34,460
Because that's just being a dick.

1618
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,460
That's what it is.

1619
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:44,460
When you're a gent, you know you're a gent.

1620
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:59,420
Oh, by the way, I would like to remind you guys that Phil Harrison back

1621
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:03,380
about a year ago said, backwards compatibility, as you know from

1622
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:08,860
PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2, is a core value of what we believe we

1623
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:14,340
should offer, and access to a library of content people have created, bought

1624
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:18,940
for themselves and accumulated over the years, is necessary to create a

1625
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:19,940
format.

1626
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:23,780
PlayStation is a format meaning that it transcends many devices,

1627
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:28,980
PS1, PS2, and now PS3.

1628
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:32,780
Well they also said that all the game developers copied their controller

1629
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:35,540
design forgetting that they copied theirs from Super Nintendo, so you

1630
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:36,540
know.

1631
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,540
Whatever.

1632
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,540
Let's continue.

1633
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:47,060
Well, actually, Sony actually released an official statement on the

1634
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:50,060
matter.

1635
01:12:50,060 --> 01:13:03,380
What is that from?

1636
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:08,060
You can't stop PS3, you can't stop it, you can't, can't stop the PS3.

1637
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:16,060
They probably think they're winning right now.

1638
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,060
We are winning.

1639
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:21,060
You can't buy a PS3 anywhere.

1640
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:26,060
Sorry, I mean, but seriously, every week is a fucking story like this.

1641
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:29,460
I mean, who the fuck is running their company?

1642
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,300
I mean, how do they, how do they make these decisions?

1643
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,300
Hey, let's have-

1644
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,300
Champanzies.

1645
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,740
I mean, who thinks up this shit?

1646
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:36,740
I swear to God.

1647
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:38,380
I read the joke earlier this week.

1648
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,580
There's some guy on their advertising or marketing strategies

1649
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:44,180
team or whatever that's trying to get fired and come up with the

1650
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:48,060
stupidest fucking ideas and wanting to get himself fired, and they're

1651
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,900
like, hey, that's a great idea, let's run with that, and it's like, my

1652
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:51,900
God.

1653
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,100
I mean, who thinks this is a crazy idea?

1654
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,100
You know what?

1655
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:59,420
I think what they do is that they have those magnets, you know, that

1656
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:04,340
you make your own poetry out of on their phone, and so they just, they

1657
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:07,700
reach in and grab like six of them and put them in order, and that's

1658
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:12,220
their new marketing plan, and that'll, and it's not people that are

1659
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,220
picking them out.

1660
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,220
They're trained monkeys.

1661
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:19,060
No, they're, they're poorly trained monkeys, and sometimes they have to wipe the poo off

1662
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:32,740
of them that they fling as they pick it.

1663
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:50,340
So how many beers did you have, Rob?

1664
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:55,300
Just one, amazingly.

1665
01:14:55,300 --> 01:15:01,420
Now's a good time for the F-use of the week, as our chat room is just,

1666
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:04,620
all I'm seeing in chat room is like, dot, dot, dot, just right on down

1667
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,340
the screen.

1668
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:07,780
Let's get into the F-use of the week.

1669
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:10,260
Ladies and gentlemen, we have some brand new old F-U music.

1670
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,900
We're bringing back an old F-U tonight, and let's kick it off.

1671
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,900
This is a part of the show where we get angsty, and obviously this news

1672
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,860
about the removed backwards compatibility, which seems to be a step

1673
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,620
backwards, makes us a little angry, and if you disagree, send us an email,

1674
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:40,860
mailbag at orangeontraded.com, but for now, the F-U's of the week.

1675
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:48,300
So my F-U of the week goes towards bitches, stupid petty bitches.

1676
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:50,740
But Jamie, then you're screwing yourself.

1677
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:55,180
Now, okay, this is what happened at work.

1678
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:58,060
Now people know that I like to leave detailed diagrams on how people

1679
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,860
should park in a parking lot.

1680
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,420
I didn't do that this time.

1681
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:04,540
I was pulling into one of the last parking spots at work, and there was this

1682
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:08,180
car that was double parked, and I nearly ran into their driver's side rear

1683
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:09,540
of the mirror.

1684
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,300
So I back out, park properly in the spot, and leave them a note that says,

1685
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,780
please do not double park.

1686
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,060
I even said please.

1687
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:19,660
It was either that or call security and get them a ticket, and if they get

1688
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:22,940
ticketed enough, then they have to park outside the parking lot.

1689
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:25,580
But we have a gate at the parking lot.

1690
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:29,540
So I go back in, and I go out, and these girls are standing around my car,

1691
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:33,340
kneeling down by my tires, and I can hear these loud echoing voices, and

1692
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:35,700
hear tire, and note, and this.

1693
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,700
And then my mother calls me.

1694
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:37,700
I'm like, crap, mom.

1695
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:40,980
So I'm talking to my mom, standing by the back door, watching them do shit to

1696
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:43,940
my car, and I have no idea what they're doing, and then they get in their car

1697
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:46,580
and drive past, and then I hear, oh, there she is!

1698
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:47,580
Like that.

1699
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:51,340
So I'm on the phone with my mother, and you don't want to get into a fight

1700
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:54,740
with loud people when you're on the phone with your mother, although my mom

1701
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,620
would probably be very proud of me.

1702
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:57,620
Not really.

1703
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:58,620
So I go back-

1704
01:16:58,620 --> 01:16:59,620
Question from chat real quick.

1705
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:03,820
SSJ100Matt asks, where was YouParkLikeAnAsshole.com in this moment?

1706
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:06,260
I didn't have any of the stickers on me.

1707
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:09,500
So I go back inside, wait five minutes, go back out after I'm off the phone

1708
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,300
with my mom, and they're gone.

1709
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:14,100
So I go back to my car, and I go about my business.

1710
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,100
Everything seems fine.

1711
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:18,140
You know, I have a magnet on my car, this little rainbow heart, and I thought

1712
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:21,100
that they stole it, but it turned out that my husband took it off when he was

1713
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,140
driving my car when he was fixing it.

1714
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:27,660
So I get back, and my tires had been low for a couple weeks, so I said, you know,

1715
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:30,660
I'm getting gas today, I'll go ahead and fill my tires.

1716
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:34,940
And I tried to get the caps off on the passenger side, and the caps wouldn't

1717
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:39,140
come off on the valve stems on my tires, but the other side was just fine.

1718
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:42,780
So I end up going to Bridgestone the next day, and they had used two wrenches

1719
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:47,880
to get the caps off, and it turned out that they put nail glue, like super glue,

1720
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,940
in the caps on my tires.

1721
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:54,300
So now, see, I think it would have been much better for them to be a little

1722
01:17:54,300 --> 01:18:00,740
peeved about a little note than be fired for vandalism and harassment, because

1723
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:02,260
that's what's going to happen to them.

1724
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,420
I have the exact time of day that they drove out of the parking lot, and we

1725
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:10,500
have cameras that record all driver's, all license plates as they go in and

1726
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:11,500
out.

1727
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,540
When you are by the place, when you get your new badge, you are required

1728
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:15,980
to give your license plate number to security.

1729
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:19,740
They're going to be very fired, all four of them, and I am going to laugh my

1730
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:20,740
ass off.

1731
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:21,740
The end.

1732
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:26,380
Wow, I didn't know we had applause.

1733
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:29,180
There's an applause light in here, apparently.

1734
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:30,180
All right, moving on.

1735
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,660
No, no, no, because see, this is what I mean.

1736
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:34,660
You don't fuck with me.

1737
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:35,660
Low key.

1738
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:36,660
Follow that.

1739
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:37,660
F.E.

1740
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:41,900
Donald's for not knowing how to fucking cook french fries, and you just put

1741
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,940
them in the fucking fryer and push buttons.

1742
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:44,940
How hard is that?

1743
01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:49,300
But yet, you fucking find a way to screw it up every single time.

1744
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:54,300
I mean, seriously, fries should taste the same every single time.

1745
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:58,620
Every time, because it's a button that you push.

1746
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:00,580
How the fuck do you fuck up a button?

1747
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:03,740
I mean, really?

1748
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:04,740
Fuck that.

1749
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:05,740
My F.E.

1750
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:06,740
Of The Week.

1751
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:07,740
Come on.

1752
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,740
Showing us signs of support tonight.

1753
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:10,740
All right.

1754
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:11,740
I'm going to keep my F.E.

1755
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:13,740
Brief tonight, because the others were a little long.

1756
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:14,740
Not that that's a problem.

1757
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:15,740
My F.E.'s brief tonight.

1758
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:18,100
I'm going to give an F.E. to show tunes.

1759
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,100
Enough said.

1760
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:24,460
Puppy, you're up next.

1761
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:30,260
I give an F.E. to the California DMV for being slow as fuck, even online.

1762
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:34,300
I paid my registration for my car two and a half weeks ago.

1763
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:37,740
They still have not sent me my new tax.

1764
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:38,740
And it's pissing me off.

1765
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:40,900
And I'm waiting to get pulled over for it.

1766
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,900
And it's going to suck.

1767
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:43,900
Hold your...

1768
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:44,900
Hold.

1769
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:48,900
Okay, now you can applaud.

1770
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,500
Casper the Gay, your F.E.'s of The Week.

1771
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:54,500
Okay, I'm going to recant my F.E. to LucasArts, because they were really slow about getting

1772
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,700
a Star Wars game to Wii.

1773
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,420
But they are going to have Force Unleashed on the Wii.

1774
01:19:57,420 --> 01:20:00,140
And of course, it's going to be the best version, because it'll have all the lightsaber battles

1775
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:01,440
and force control and stuff.

1776
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,980
So yay, LucasArts.

1777
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:06,020
That wasn't a true F.U., so you don't get applause.

1778
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,020
I had to recant it, so...

1779
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,020
In fact, you get booed.

1780
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,020
Okay, they suck.

1781
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:10,020
They're shitheads.

1782
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:13,620
How can you recant something that you never said in the first place?

1783
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:14,620
Yeah, I did.

1784
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:15,620
A couple weeks ago.

1785
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:16,620
Three or four...

1786
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:17,620
Yeah.

1787
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:18,620
Rice Princess, your turn.

1788
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:22,020
F.U. to recanting stuff that you never said in the first place.

1789
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,020
Yay!

1790
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:28,140
I'm sort of trying to clap.

1791
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:38,540
Back to the show, from Angst and F.U.s to Harvest Moon.

1792
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:42,260
Harvest Moon, if you are a fan of farming, and actually I know there's some fans of Harvest

1793
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:46,020
Moon, because I dared to make fun of Harvest Moon.

1794
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:49,420
What else do you do on Harvest Moon?

1795
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:52,300
You try to pick up a chick.

1796
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,860
I know we have some fans of Harvest Moon, because I got yelled at by one one week in

1797
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:55,860
an email.

1798
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:56,860
You're a fan of Harvest Moon.

1799
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,980
Okay, well then good, this ought to be good news.

1800
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:02,660
The Harvest Moon creator, Yasuo Iwata, has announced that the next Harvest Moon game

1801
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:05,460
is going to be online.

1802
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:09,500
Meaning that between two and eight players can actually visit a town.

1803
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:12,860
The only trick, we don't know what platform the game's on yet.

1804
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:16,180
But the next Harvest Moon game will be online.

1805
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:17,180
So there it is.

1806
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,780
And it won't be Nintendo.

1807
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:19,780
Well, not necessarily.

1808
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:20,780
It could be DS.

1809
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:22,420
That could be a very DS thing.

1810
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:25,980
What are you going to do, have competitive cow milking?

1811
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,260
Stop releasing so many damn Harvest Moon games.

1812
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:31,380
There's been like four this year already, and there's still more coming.

1813
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:32,380
Well, no, I'm serious.

1814
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:35,020
What are you going to do, have competing farms or some shit?

1815
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:36,820
Or go visit other people's cows?

1816
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:40,460
What the hell did you do in Animal Crossing?

1817
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:43,380
You ran to towns and hit people with bug nets, and it was funny.

1818
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:44,760
Or buried things in holes.

1819
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,900
And you sent dirty letters to their townsfolk.

1820
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:49,500
That's right, and you buried pitfalls in front of people's houses.

1821
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,500
No, I'll tell you what you do in Animal Crossing.

1822
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:57,220
You play the game with your best friend, only to have him backstab you and get the trophy

1823
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:59,380
first.

1824
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:01,420
Did you forget, Rob, so easily?

1825
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:03,940
Yeah, actually, I did forget.

1826
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:05,700
Somebody's got some issues.

1827
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,260
Hey, you know what?

1828
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:09,260
It hurt.

1829
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:13,500
Well, you're seriously mad that I went and got the gold villager?

1830
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,500
I was mad for like two minutes.

1831
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,260
I was like, stupid motherfucker.

1832
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:17,660
It's been a little longer than two minutes.

1833
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:18,980
It's been like two and a half years.

1834
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:19,980
Well, you know what?

1835
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,980
I thought about it again, okay?

1836
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:22,980
Jeez.

1837
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:23,980
Work with me on this.

1838
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:24,980
Gosh.

1839
01:22:24,980 --> 01:22:25,980
Oops.

1840
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:26,980
You know what?

1841
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:32,620
I want factory moon, where instead of having a cow on a farm, you have a cow factory.

1842
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:35,260
You have like a deer, like a, you know, cow shwits.

1843
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:38,780
Yeah, I was going to say, all they need to do is put a slaughterhouse in Harvest Moon,

1844
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,900
and the game will be like ten times cooler.

1845
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,020
Well, they do have-

1846
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:44,940
PETA will protest.

1847
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:51,620
They do have Innocent Life, a futuristic Harvest Moon, which takes farming to the future.

1848
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:52,620
Guess what?

1849
01:22:52,620 --> 01:23:00,180
It's just the same as farming now, except it's in the future.

1850
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,780
Hurrah.

1851
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:04,100
Let's go on to the next story.

1852
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:07,060
I don't think there's anything more we can say on Harvest Moon.

1853
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,460
Except that it's Harvest Moon.

1854
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:15,340
So this should, this is actually pretty, and I love stuff like this, where they do studies

1855
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:20,820
about how video games improve your intelligence and your skills and shit.

1856
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:24,620
They're saying now that action games improve women's spatial abilities.

1857
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:26,100
Okay.

1858
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:30,820
Because they didn't have any to begin with.

1859
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:33,260
I'm asking a hypothetical question.

1860
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:40,260
It says that it helps improve skills like geometry, technical drawings, reading maps.

1861
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:43,180
Anything that has to do with space and how-

1862
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:46,060
Not that a woman would ever admit to doing that.

1863
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:51,340
Why do you need geometry for shopping anyway?

1864
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:52,340
Geometry?

1865
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:54,340
What is that?

1866
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:55,340
Geometry?

1867
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,340
What?

1868
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,340
I'm just kidding.

1869
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:59,340
Here, take this back.

1870
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:06,540
But it's more or less the cognitive function of how things fit, how things are laid out.

1871
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:11,500
Space, you know, judging distances, that type of thing.

1872
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:19,580
But I look at it this way, that anything that you do that makes you use that skill should

1873
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:20,740
improve it.

1874
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:26,620
So really, a video game could help with that, but so could actually, you know, practicing

1875
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:33,100
topography or, you know, spending time drawing or-

1876
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,100
Raising cows.

1877
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,800
No, not raising cows.

1878
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:41,660
So which one of those abilities focuses on using the turn signal when switching lanes?

1879
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:42,660
You know what?

1880
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,460
I have actually run across more male drivers-

1881
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:47,220
I was trying very hard to refrain from the driving joke.

1882
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:48,460
You should be very proud of me.

1883
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:52,060
I was trying very hard not to say, but will it make them better drivers?

1884
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:54,140
I was doing very, very good.

1885
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:55,140
You know what?

1886
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:56,940
Gender has absolutely nothing to do with bad driving.

1887
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:00,400
It's overall intelligence, and I've run it across more male drivers who are worse drivers

1888
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,400
than women.

1889
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,940
Okay, well then this makes the point, why just women?

1890
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:06,060
Why doesn't it give men better spatial abilities?

1891
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:10,060
Because I think that they've just did the study on women.

1892
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:12,060
Because we're super awesome.

1893
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:13,060
No.

1894
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:17,300
Because I know that the majority of people in this room are male, but I'm sorry, testosterone

1895
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,300
makes you stupid.

1896
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,300
Oh, snap.

1897
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,300
No, no, no, no.

1898
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,300
This is Rob's party.

1899
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:22,300
What are you talking about, testosterone?

1900
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:33,900
I don't mean it like that, but I think that having a higher tendency toward aggression

1901
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,940
usually leads to less common sense.

1902
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:36,940
I see.

1903
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:40,660
Now, JV Monn in the chat room gives a comment that makes it all make sense.

1904
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:44,300
JV Monn says, men get better spatial ability from masturbating.

1905
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:47,820
So you know how much clearance you need?

1906
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:50,220
There you go.

1907
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:56,140
I don't really think that men have, I don't really think, after living in a house and

1908
01:25:56,140 --> 01:26:01,580
having my husband and all of his friends over, I don't think that, from that sample, I don't

1909
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:08,140
think that all men have good spatial ability or else they wouldn't pee on the seat.

1910
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:12,100
And we learn how to close the seat when they're done.

1911
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,340
Hey, you know what?

1912
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:18,580
Some things are skill, some things are luck, okay?

1913
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:19,580
You know what?

1914
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,780
You learn how to pee when you're little, so you should have a lot of practice.

1915
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:23,620
God, is this segment done yet?

1916
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:24,620
Never.

1917
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:25,620
Oh, lordy.

1918
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:29,580
This is probably going to be like our longest segment in a long time.

1919
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:31,060
We're already over an hour and a half.

1920
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,060
Anyway.

1921
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:33,060
Anyways.

1922
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:34,060
Yes, please.

1923
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:46,580
Speaking of pee, SingStar R&B has been announced, because god damn there hasn't been enough SingStar

1924
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:54,380
games this year yet, but apparently a wonderful track list is coming out as well, including

1925
01:26:54,380 --> 01:27:02,940
all sorts of fun stuff, Black Eyed Peas, Pump It, Destiny's Child, Bootylicious, DJ Jazzy

1926
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:11,700
Jeff and the French Prince, Summertime, that's pretty awesome, Gwen Stefani, Hollaback Girl,

1927
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:20,860
and let's see here, Luther Vandross, Never Too Much, OutKast, Idlewild, Blue, Don't You

1928
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:29,260
Worry About Me, and Whitney Houston, Your Love Is My Love, among others.

1929
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:33,700
And I knew it would take merely seconds for someone to make this comment, but a Hippolytus

1930
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:36,060
in our chat room says, Black Eyed Peas is not R&B.

1931
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:40,380
That would take five seconds for someone to say that.

1932
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:43,220
Don't tell my mother about this game, because she loves Luther Vandross.

1933
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:44,220
She really does.

1934
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:47,240
And if you know my mother, she's...

1935
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:48,300
I think she likes both.

1936
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:53,900
I don't think Hollaback Girl is R&B either, but you know, whatever.

1937
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:54,900
That's true too.

1938
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:55,900
I don't know.

1939
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:56,900
A little bit.

1940
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:57,900
All right.

1941
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:03,580
Anyway, let's go on to a brand new segment, which is going to be our last segment of part

1942
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,940
A tonight.

1943
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,580
We're going to actually make this kind of a regular thing, is that this will always

1944
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:13,340
kind of be our bookend to part A, moving into part B, is a brand new segment here on Orange

1945
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:14,340
Laundry Radio.

1946
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:15,700
We've been promising it for weeks.

1947
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:16,700
It's here.

1948
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:20,340
It's Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week.

1949
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:25,380
But I have the same old music.

1950
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:28,660
I know, because the chat room really liked the old music.

1951
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:31,020
It didn't want to see it go away, so we had to keep it.

1952
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:33,860
So Dark Sakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1953
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:41,460
The Classic Game of the Week is Fantasy Zone, which is my second favorite video game ever.

1954
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:46,020
Fantasy Zone is a game where you play as a little ship called the Oppa Oppa.

1955
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,460
It's this little red ship with a window on it.

1956
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:52,740
It has wings, but when it's on the ground, it walks.

1957
01:28:52,740 --> 01:29:01,580
And listen, the music has got the best music ever.

1958
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:04,300
It plays a lot like Defender.

1959
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,300
It is.

1960
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,300
It's Chibi Defender, basically.

1961
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,300
Anyway, you can keep reading.

1962
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,300
I'm going to let this play in the background.

1963
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:18,700
I just want to play a little bit of music in the chat room.

1964
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:19,700
Good times.

1965
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:20,700
I like how the ship has feet.

1966
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:24,260
Yeah, when you're on the ground, the ship has feet, and it walks.

1967
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:27,740
It's cute.

1968
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:30,660
The Oppa Oppa actually was first in the Zillion anime.

1969
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:33,180
I don't know if anyone's ever played Zillion.

1970
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:37,300
Zillion was the game that they based the Zapper off of for the Master System.

1971
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:41,440
But there were also other versions that came out.

1972
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,440
There was...

1973
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,180
And I actually have the other versions.

1974
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:49,860
I have Fantasy Zone on Master System and Super Nintendo, Fantasy Zone 2 on both.

1975
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:50,860
I have...

1976
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:53,180
Now, Space Fantasy Zone was one that came out on...

1977
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:58,580
Well, it was a prototype only that was supposed to be out on the TurboGrafx Duo.

1978
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:01,980
And I have a burn of it, but I haven't actually sat down and played it yet.

1979
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:07,220
And then there was a Super Fantasy Zone.

1980
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:13,240
Also for anyone who's a fan of in-portrait and cast games, some of the enemies from Fantasy

1981
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:21,620
Zone 2 were in the final boss for the game Sega Gaga, for anyone who can play that.

1982
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:23,020
But it's a fun little game.

1983
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:29,580
And also the Fantasy Zone is the same universe that Space Harrier was set in.

1984
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:37,260
And you actually have a later level in Fantasy Zone that's the Space Harrier level.

1985
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:43,220
Yes, currently our little ship, the Opa-Opa, is fighting a big tree that's spinning leaves.

1986
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:44,220
A tree trunk.

1987
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,220
But it's cute!

1988
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:46,220
It's cute!

1989
01:30:46,220 --> 01:30:47,220
It's okay.

1990
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:51,380
Well, in the Space Harrier level, you actually fight low-eye heads.

1991
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:54,020
But also another thing.

1992
01:30:54,020 --> 01:31:01,620
For anyone who was collecting the Sega Ages 2900 collection, they redid the whole thing

1993
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:05,220
in 3D, but it was still side-scrolling.

1994
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:11,380
But when you did your bonus level where you have to go catch all these coins, it was in

1995
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:12,380
first person.

1996
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:15,220
So, Rob, you played Mike Robbie.

1997
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:16,220
Yes.

1998
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,220
It was kind of neat.

1999
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:23,020
But it was probably one of the best Sega games ever.

2000
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:24,020
I think.

2001
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,020
Alright.

2002
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:30,400
And you could also go in shops and buy, like, anvils.

2003
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,400
And wings!

2004
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,400
And fairy wings for your ship.

2005
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,020
And you could buy wings and you could buy extra boosters and different types of rockets.

2006
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:39,620
But I just like you buy this big thing that's like the one ton thing that they drop in the

2007
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:42,100
Looney Tunes cartoons and just drop it on ships.

2008
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:43,100
It was great.

2009
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:44,100
Good times.

2010
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:50,220
Alright, well, Fantasy Zone is the classic game of the week, so check it out at your

2011
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:55,260
local swap meet or, you know, there's other ways you can go about finding a ROM of Fantasy

2012
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,260
Zone.

2013
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,260
But we can't talk about that on the show.

2014
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:58,260
Two dollars on eBay.

2015
01:31:58,260 --> 01:31:59,260
Alright.

2016
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:02,980
Well, that's going to bring to a close part A of our podcast, but fear not, there's plenty

2017
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:07,360
more Orange Launch Radio to come, like it or not, in part B. And coming up tonight in

2018
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:12,780
part B, since it is episode 250, we have to do one of our very favorite segments, Match

2019
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:13,780
Game, coming up tonight.

2020
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:14,780
That's right.

2021
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:15,780
Applause.

2022
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,660
The light is, our new applause light is flashing apparently.

2023
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:18,660
Alright.

2024
01:32:18,660 --> 01:32:20,540
So the match game will be up in just a little bit.

2025
01:32:20,540 --> 01:32:23,540
We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this, which, by the way,

2026
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:25,740
oh, I need to say one more thing about the show.

2027
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:29,620
The show is now going to be released on, due to popular demand, instead of making it wait

2028
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:32,620
until Wednesday, you now get part B on Tuesday on the feed.

2029
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:35,620
I thought you were saying we're going to release it on Betamax.

2030
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:36,620
Maybe we could, actually.

2031
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:37,620
Dude, that would be cool.

2032
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:39,380
We could actually find a working beta machine.

2033
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:41,780
We have to go to the TV station to find that.

2034
01:32:41,780 --> 01:32:44,740
It'll be released on Laserdisc and beta.

2035
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:45,740
Alright.

2036
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:50,820
And hopefully we will try very hard to keep part B show tunes free.

2037
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:51,820
Alright.

2038
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:52,820
We'll see.

2039
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:53,820
Maybe.

2040
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:57,660
Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Launch Radio.

2041
01:32:57,660 --> 01:33:02,060
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

2042
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:03,060
a week.

2043
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:16,020
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
