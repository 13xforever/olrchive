00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:23,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, October 7th, 2007, Bungie and Microsoft file for divorce, World of Warcraft celebrates alcohol, and Nintendo gives something away to all Wii owners.

2
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:35,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:41,667
[SPEAKER_15]: We are that program on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:44,228
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

5
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starting Oktoberfest early.

7
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:50,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you?

8
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:52,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes I am, with British ale.

9
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:52,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy.

10
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:53,893
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you drinking tonight?

11
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:54,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Newcastle.

12
00:00:54,914 --> 00:00:55,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Yummy.

13
00:00:55,474 --> 00:00:55,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Best ever.

14
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:58,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to Loki.

15
00:00:59,554 --> 00:01:02,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm drinking watered down coke from McDonald's.

16
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:04,936
[SPEAKER_02]: You sure know how to party.

17
00:01:05,436 --> 00:01:07,297
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very disappointed in your German-ness.

18
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Their fries sucked.

19
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:16,320
[SPEAKER_15]: And also say hello, joining us tonight, this somebody has not been on our program in a damn long time, but he's here tonight.

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello to Black Lab, a.k.a.

21
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:19,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Puppy.

22
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:22,124
[SPEAKER_14]: I made it out of Davis alive, thank God.

23
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:29,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, you used to be our correspondent for the People's Republic of Davis, which if you live where our show is taped, Sacramento, you understand why that joke is funny.

24
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:32,991
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you're an international or national listener, you have no clue what we're talking about.

25
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:34,231
[SPEAKER_15]: But just trust us, it's funny.

26
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:36,653
[SPEAKER_15]: But you're free from the perils of Davis now.

27
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:37,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I am.

28
00:01:37,393 --> 00:01:38,214
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're living on your own.

29
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:39,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, actually.

30
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:40,936
[SPEAKER_13]: They've let you out of the prisoner camp.

31
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:44,798
[SPEAKER_15]: So rule number one of living on your own, make sure the mic is real close to your mouth because you're not very sensitive.

32
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:45,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

33
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:46,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Just don't eat it.

34
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:49,152
[SPEAKER_15]: So what have you been up to since you've been on the show last?

35
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:52,253
[SPEAKER_14]: How long has it been?

36
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,034
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been like at least a year now.

37
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:54,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't we in double digits?

38
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:56,835
[SPEAKER_15]: I think so, first time he was here.

39
00:01:57,215 --> 00:02:02,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Puppy, you used to work in an arcade, and that's one thing you used to kind of come on the show and talk to us about.

40
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:04,938
[SPEAKER_15]: What arcade did you used to work at a long time ago?

41
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:06,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Castro Valley Golf Land.

42
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:10,321
[SPEAKER_15]: And what kinds of big popular machines were there at Castro Valley Golf Land?

43
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:11,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I think

44
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:13,865
[SPEAKER_14]: One of them dancing machines, I think.

45
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:15,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, the dance game?

46
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:16,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, they had Time Crisis 3.

47
00:02:16,187 --> 00:02:17,348
[SPEAKER_14]: That was pretty popular.

48
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:18,889
[SPEAKER_14]: That all the dancing fools played?

49
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:19,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

50
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

51
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:21,551
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I was one of them.

52
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:22,172
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

53
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:28,658
[SPEAKER_15]: So would you say that the skills that you learned working in an arcade have helped you in the real world?

54
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:30,319
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

55
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:30,980
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

56
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,861
[SPEAKER_15]: You didn't learn anything there, huh?

57
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:34,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a damn thing.

58
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Except that I hate kids.

59
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:37,786
[SPEAKER_15]: It was one step above flipping burgers, yes?

60
00:02:37,826 --> 00:02:37,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

61
00:02:39,915 --> 00:02:43,238
[SPEAKER_14]: I still had to serve pizza on weekends for parties.

62
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:48,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Or in retrospect, would you rather have been frying french fries incorrectly at McDonald's?

63
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:54,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I would know how to fry something at McDonald's because I would actually understand the instructional videos.

64
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:03,535
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one time that people got pissed off at McDonald's because I was sitting in the middle of the lobby with a chair that I pulled out from a table.

65
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:18,349
[SPEAKER_02]: and sitting there talking because my friends are all talking and just sitting there and talking or basically standing there and talking and I got tired to stand there so I pulled over a chair and sat down next to everybody and then the manager comes over and he's like what the fuck is that chair doing in the middle of this lobby?

66
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, I mean, it's like they're like almost closed anyways and there's no one there.

67
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that how they really talk?

68
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,415
[SPEAKER_15]: What a bunch of potty mouths.

69
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:26,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he was a stoner so...

70
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,821
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

71
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we're going to pizza your face.

72
00:03:58,051 --> 00:03:58,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

73
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to operate a large knife.

74
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:03,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, no, I didn't go around going, hey, we're part of the Roundtable gang.

75
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,295
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we worked at Roundtable.

76
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:08,397
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a commune of Roundtable people.

77
00:04:09,278 --> 00:04:14,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, folks, you'll notice there's two empty chairs back here if you're watching on our Operator 11 live webcam or our archive.

78
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:15,942
[SPEAKER_15]: There's two empty chairs back here.

79
00:04:15,982 --> 00:04:22,026
[SPEAKER_15]: That's because Rice Princess and Casper the Gay or whatever his name is are joining us tonight, but they're late.

80
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:23,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Target, Target, Target

81
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:36,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need a table because there would be no room for a table in here.

82
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:37,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for the beer.

83
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:38,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.

84
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:38,407
[SPEAKER_15]: No, not that.

85
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:39,127
[SPEAKER_15]: That'll have to be an edit.

86
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:03,245
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura

87
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:32,535
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna go sit in the chairs, because I feel bad that the Op 11 people are looking at nothing.

88
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:33,256
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'll sit in the chairs.

89
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:34,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at my laptop, apparently.

90
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:34,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

91
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:39,218
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this week, I played a shit ton of Ragnarok.

92
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:43,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not talking about my regular, you know, buttload.

93
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about a shit ton of Ragnarok.

94
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a shit ton, is that like metric?

95
00:05:48,301 --> 00:05:49,002
[SPEAKER_04]: It's metric.

96
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:55,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if I was going to go with the Don French description, it would be crock shits of Ragnarok.

97
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like shit kilo, you know.

98
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:02,325
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I have been, I decided to start a new class.

99
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:04,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I started it last night.

100
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:05,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the Taekwon Girl.

101
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:09,808
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you don't get weapons, you just kick things in the face.

102
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:12,570
[SPEAKER_04]: You just kick them in the face.

103
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we get a live demonstration?

104
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:14,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Puppy, lie down.

105
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:15,371
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

106
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think so.

107
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:22,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I, um, I started the character last night, and I'm playing today.

108
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:27,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Got her up to a Star Gladiator, which was actually kind of a really weird game earlier.

109
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:34,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So I now have her at level 70, and I started her yesterday.

110
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:36,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Last night.

111
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:38,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Go Pirate Servers!

112
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:38,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome job.

113
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't have to work tomorrow, so I'm going to play more games tomorrow.

114
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:43,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Good job.

115
00:06:44,552 --> 00:06:45,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, sounds good.

116
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, let's keep right on moving along.

117
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:48,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

118
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:50,031
[SPEAKER_02]: My gaming week was fun.

119
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:53,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been continuing playing Halo on Legendary.

120
00:06:53,692 --> 00:07:00,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally got past the part that I was stuck because I realized, hey, I can go backtrack and there's a ton of weapons back there.

121
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:02,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit, forgot all about that stuff.

122
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:05,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can play with the AI because they won't go past a certain part.

123
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:11,076
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll chase after you and stuff and be like, ha, I'm in the safe zone or some shit.

124
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:13,336
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't attack me and they'll run back.

125
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:14,196
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.

126
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:15,657
[SPEAKER_02]: The AI is kind of dumb.

127
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:17,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you done the confetti head thing?

128
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:21,429
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm playing through just by myself.

129
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,812
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura's husband showed me the headshot confetti thing.

130
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:27,893
[SPEAKER_15]: That is hilarious.

131
00:07:28,473 --> 00:07:35,137
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes, like, you shoot off the thing and it makes this little, I think we have the exact same noise in our audio library.

132
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:38,159
[SPEAKER_15]: It has these little kids cheering when you do it.

133
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:39,971
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking for the... Keep going.

134
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:41,492
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll imitate them anyways.

135
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:44,632
[SPEAKER_02]: So, other stuff I've been playing.

136
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:47,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually bought... What was it?

137
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:48,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Flat Out Ultimate Carnage.

138
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:50,133
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is fucking awesome.

139
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:53,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just lots of driving, crashing into things.

140
00:07:53,794 --> 00:08:03,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the Ragdoll Olympics stuff for quite a while, so I was launching my character through windshields and flinging them down a ski slope.

141
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:04,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like that.

142
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:06,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Real fun game, though.

143
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:07,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

144
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:09,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Food Network is great.

145
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:37,704
[SPEAKER_15]: And how is Halo going?

146
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:38,744
[SPEAKER_15]: You a big fan of the Halo?

147
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:07,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I am, sadly.

148
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:14,656
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still confused by some things in the plot, and other than that, I just shoot things.

149
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:17,539
[SPEAKER_14]: And I like the little grunt head explosions.

150
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:19,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I found the sound effect.

151
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,121
[SPEAKER_15]: So when you shoot them in the head, you get this.

152
00:09:22,322 --> 00:09:23,423
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes that little sound effect.

153
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:26,005
[SPEAKER_14]: A little confetti blows up everywhere.

154
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:26,686
[SPEAKER_15]: It's awesome.

155
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:32,991
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fun when you turn up the explosions on that, too, so that when you shoot one in the head, all the ones around them go off, too, and explode.

156
00:09:33,464 --> 00:09:35,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan was going around punching people in the head with a skull.

157
00:09:37,547 --> 00:09:37,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times.

158
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,607
[SPEAKER_15]: That was pretty cool.

159
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:38,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times.

160
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:40,789
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's it for your gaming week?

161
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:42,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, pretty much.

162
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,632
[SPEAKER_14]: I was playing WoW for a while, but ever since Halo 3 came out, I pretty much stopped.

163
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:47,373
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

164
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:53,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, finally joining us, they're a little bit late tonight, so you guys are so fired, but they're here in studio.

165
00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:56,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello to Rice Princess, and what are we calling you now, Casper?

166
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Casper the Game.

167
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,860
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, I can never remember.

168
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:00,441
[SPEAKER_15]: He's Eddie to me.

169
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:01,181
[SPEAKER_15]: He'll always be Eddie.

170
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:01,842
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

171
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,076
[SPEAKER_15]: So Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

172
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:04,737
[SPEAKER_15]: What have you been playing?

173
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:06,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

174
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it ever change, really?

175
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's pretty much it.

176
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you have my sweater.

177
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:14,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so glad.

178
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:15,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, you left your sweater here.

179
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:17,726
[SPEAKER_05]: My Alliance sweater.

180
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:25,152
[SPEAKER_15]: What's hilarious is that the only way we knew who it belonged to is that we saw that it was an Alliance sweatshirt that you left here, and we were like, who the fuck plays Alliance?

181
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:25,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

182
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:27,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Only cool people do.

183
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:29,283
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were like, oh, it must be Rice Princess.

184
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:31,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So please take this thing out of my house.

185
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:33,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an Alliance character, at least she's sort of evil.

186
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:36,448
[SPEAKER_15]: The only reason worth playing Alliance is for the J'nai.

187
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:38,530
[SPEAKER_15]: But it gets old.

188
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

189
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:40,752
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you want to play with 12-year-olds.

190
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:41,712
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play a Warlock.

191
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:43,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to play a cool side.

192
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:44,915
[SPEAKER_15]: You can play Warlocks on Horde's side.

193
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:45,715
[SPEAKER_15]: They're much cooler.

194
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:46,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Warlocks are much better.

195
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:48,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Warlocks are lame.

196
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:49,518
[SPEAKER_15]: You're lame.

197
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:54,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, before we turn into the WoWcast, is there anything else you want to share for your gaming week?

198
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:55,189
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

199
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:57,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, then Casper, how was your gaming week?

200
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:58,811
[SPEAKER_11]: It was awesome.

201
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,592
[SPEAKER_11]: I got Phantom Hourglass, the new Zelda game for DS.

202
00:11:01,632 --> 00:11:02,152
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really good.

203
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:03,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's really good.

204
00:11:04,193 --> 00:11:09,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally, they get to not make you fumble between the D-pad and the buttons and the stylus all at the same time.

205
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,436
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all stylus and it's very smooth.

206
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:12,457
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very cool control style.

207
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,966
[SPEAKER_15]: So tell me a little more about it, because I'm contemplating if I want to buy it or not.

208
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:20,569
[SPEAKER_15]: So how does it play compared to the other Zeldas?

209
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:22,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it more Wind Waker?

210
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:23,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it more Super Nintendo Zelda?

211
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:25,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's a direct sequel to Wind Waker.

212
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:27,117
[SPEAKER_11]: It takes place right after the end of Wind Waker.

213
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:29,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Same style.

214
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,121
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like that cel shading.

215
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:32,243
[SPEAKER_11]: A little downplayed for the DS, but it still looks pretty good.

216
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:34,206
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, just really cool.

217
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,007
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

218
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,110
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

219
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,552
[SPEAKER_15]: And GS68 in our chat room is screaming, no spoilers.

220
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:09,772
[SPEAKER_15]: So please, no spoilers.

221
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not that far, so I really can't spoil anything.

222
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,274
[SPEAKER_04]: No spoilers until Eris gets it.

223
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:14,675
[SPEAKER_04]: So go ahead and spoil.

224
00:12:14,695 --> 00:12:15,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

225
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:16,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Link dies.

226
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:18,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Link dies at the end.

227
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,031
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

228
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:21,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow, my gaming week.

229
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:24,657
[SPEAKER_15]: I've also been playing World of Warcraft.

230
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,201
[SPEAKER_15]: I got to level 68, so I have a flying mount now.

231
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:29,705
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a flying mount because I play a druid.

232
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:30,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you so?

233
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:32,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so I get a free flying mount.

234
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:34,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Or if it's not free, it costs me eight gold.

235
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:34,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Woo-hoo!

236
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:36,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow.

237
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:38,233
[SPEAKER_15]: And I ran instances.

238
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,074
[SPEAKER_15]: As a guild, we ran under Bog and Slave pens.

239
00:12:43,174 --> 00:12:46,755
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's how I leveled.

240
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:53,917
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like this week's episode of the Sarah Silverman program, all of a sudden, where they're playing D&D for 24 hours straight.

241
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:56,398
[SPEAKER_15]: I've done that.

242
00:12:56,518 --> 00:12:57,638
[SPEAKER_15]: You're the hardcore-est of the nerds.

243
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:00,359
[SPEAKER_15]: You're queen of the nerd people.

244
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,640
[SPEAKER_15]: She's just a princess.

245
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,020
[SPEAKER_15]: You're the queen.

246
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:04,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, let's see.

247
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:07,864
[SPEAKER_15]: So, also my gaming week, I played Tetris Splash.

248
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:12,146
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually bought the new Tetris Splash, which was the Xbox Live Arcade game of the week.

249
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:13,667
[SPEAKER_15]: And Tetris Splash is okay.

250
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:19,490
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's Tetris, and it has its competitive mode, which plays really smoothly on Xbox Live, I gotta say.

251
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,613
[SPEAKER_15]: And it seems like the audience of people playing the game, not a lot of jerks, which is good.

252
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:24,413
[SPEAKER_15]: You get some pretty good people.

253
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:26,134
[SPEAKER_15]: And some people who are really skilled at Tetris.

254
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:31,157
[SPEAKER_15]: I got my butt whooped in a ranked match by some people who are really good at Tetris, and I'm not so good at Tetris.

255
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:31,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Tetris is fun.

256
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:33,499
[SPEAKER_11]: They have that on DS, and it was like, it's crazy.

257
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:34,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, Tetris, oh, but it's fun.

258
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:42,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's why Tetris Splash pissed me off, though, is it just made the fact that I actually bought Tetris Evolution even more salt in the wound.

259
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:45,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that game was like $30 on Xbox 360, and I never used this $10 version.

260
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:49,072
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so mad.

261
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:50,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, why did they do that?

262
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:50,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

263
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,274
[SPEAKER_15]: They didn't even wait, like, six months.

264
00:13:53,414 --> 00:14:00,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Tetris Evolution came out, like, three months ago, and now we have an even, a slightly, I don't know if you'd say better version.

265
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:02,218
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it is kind of a better version.

266
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,339
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't have the HD videos.

267
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,580
[SPEAKER_15]: It has that stupid aquarium.

268
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,461
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like a, it looks like a screensaver from After Dark.

269
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:13,824
[SPEAKER_15]: But, here's the thing that pissed me off about that is, have you heard about the microtransactions with this?

270
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:14,564
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

271
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:16,225
[SPEAKER_15]: The day they released Tetris,

272
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:25,970
[SPEAKER_15]: The day they released Tetris Splash on Xbox Live Arcade, they released 15 different download packs for Tetris Splash.

273
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,810
[SPEAKER_15]: No, maybe it's like 11.

274
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:28,650
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's more than 10.

275
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:34,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Between 80 and 150 points per download.

276
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:35,793
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what these things are?

277
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,294
[SPEAKER_15]: They're just new fish for your tank.

278
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:42,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Or new tanks to put the fish in.

279
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Now let me ask you, do you play Tetris to stare at the background?

280
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:47,439
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

281
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:52,742
[SPEAKER_15]: So what's the point of downloading fish and fish tanks?

282
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:55,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Then don't buy it.

283
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:56,924
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a sucker born every second.

284
00:14:57,124 --> 00:14:57,584
[SPEAKER_02]: How about this?

285
00:14:57,784 --> 00:15:04,587
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either that or they could have made the game more expensive and threw them in there for free, which I think would have been a better move to make the money.

286
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,128
[SPEAKER_15]: I think a better move would have been...

287
00:15:06,728 --> 00:15:13,513
[SPEAKER_15]: What they were starting to do, which is you unlock more fish as you unlock more achievements, or you get lines in the game.

288
00:15:13,553 --> 00:15:15,334
[SPEAKER_11]: You and your logic and your critical thinking.

289
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:18,616
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I could not believe that.

290
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:21,298
[SPEAKER_15]: If you buy this stuff, you're a sucker.

291
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:23,119
[SPEAKER_15]: You're an absolute sucker.

292
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:27,101
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy this stuff, I got some Guitar Hero download packs for you.

293
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,717
[SPEAKER_15]: I love Tetris, which is why this makes me mad.

294
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:39,822
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like Tetris on the 360 is fucked beyond belief between this whole evolution and now microtransaction fish tank thing.

295
00:15:40,003 --> 00:15:42,264
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, Rob, I hate the word microtransaction.

296
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:43,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's what it is.

297
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:46,027
[SPEAKER_04]: A transaction is a transaction no matter how big or small.

298
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:48,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's what they call it.

299
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:50,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you write a letter to EA and all those people?

300
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:54,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the same problem with pre-boarding because you're not really pre-boarding, you're just boarding.

301
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:57,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Early.

302
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Why you gotta derail my segment, huh?

303
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:03,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, technically, a microtransaction is an accurate description.

304
00:16:03,302 --> 00:16:06,443
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a transaction that is small, hence micro.

305
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:10,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I were a Jolly Rancher for five cents, would that be a microtransaction?

306
00:16:10,684 --> 00:16:12,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it would be a microtransaction.

307
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:13,305
[SPEAKER_02]: That would.

308
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:15,046
[SPEAKER_03]: What defines micro or macro?

309
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:18,267
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a suck transaction, because if you buy this, you suck.

310
00:16:18,347 --> 00:16:20,588
[SPEAKER_03]: If I buy a computer, is it a microtransaction?

311
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:22,288
[SPEAKER_15]: If you support this, you suck.

312
00:16:22,408 --> 00:16:24,809
[SPEAKER_02]: A microtransaction would be, for example...

313
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say Oblivion.

314
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,291
[SPEAKER_02]: When you buy the retail copy of Oblivion, that would be a macro transaction.

315
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:35,455
[SPEAKER_02]: When you buy add-on content that is cheaper than the purchase of the game, that is a micro transaction.

316
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:37,796
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I would think that buying the system would be the macro transaction.

317
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot believe we're having an argument.

318
00:16:39,077 --> 00:16:41,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Buying the game would be a neutral transaction.

319
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:42,859
[SPEAKER_12]: Round two.

320
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Fight!

321
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:48,823
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the semantics webcast.

322
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:54,706
[SPEAKER_15]: GS68 in our chatroom says, Buying a PS3 equals a macro transaction.

323
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:57,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Suck Transaction

324
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:07,777
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

325
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,080
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, that's too much ego.

326
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:37,126
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, once a year is acceptable, and we did that with our five-year anniversary show, but if we were to kind of, like, promote, hey, it's episode 250, everybody should congratulate us again.

327
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:41,949
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like celebrating your anniversaries with your spouse or something every month or something.

328
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:43,710
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, our 13-month anniversary!

329
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, awesome.

330
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:46,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, that's what it is.

331
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:48,333
[SPEAKER_02]: After a while, it's just like, eh, whatever.

332
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:51,796
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, this is just an eh, whatever episode of Orange Laundry.

333
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,441
[SPEAKER_15]: But we do have some special stuff tonight.

334
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:58,764
[SPEAKER_15]: We actually have Insanist is one of our correspondents in Seattle.

335
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:02,947
[SPEAKER_15]: He's actually, since he lives in Seattle, he's at the World Cyber Games this weekend.

336
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:05,709
[SPEAKER_15]: And he actually called us a little earlier today to say this.

337
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio.

338
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:13,435
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Insanist reporting live from Seattle, Washington here Sunday, October 7th, 2007.

339
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:20,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm calling to let you know that you missed out on some extraordinary goings on here at the World Cyber Games.

340
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,411
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you not familiar, the Olympics of video games.

341
00:18:24,252 --> 00:18:34,816
[SPEAKER_09]: There were people from 74 countries, 700 gamers playing 12 different games, ranging from Command & Conquer 3 all the way to a huge favorite, StarCraft.

342
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:41,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of huge upsets, which my partner in crime, DJ Tyrant, will get to you later about.

343
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you that this is something you don't ever want to miss.

344
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:48,663
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of a kind event

345
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:54,709
[SPEAKER_09]: meeting people from all sorts of countries at the press event, at press tournaments, everything.

346
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:10,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually, probably the funniest thing, any sort of tournament or competition I tried to enter, I lost to somebody from another country every single time.

347
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:18,868
[SPEAKER_09]: But just being able to take in all the cultural aspects, but just being here as one, all as gamers, just having a good time,

348
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:20,037
[SPEAKER_09]: was great.

349
00:19:21,498 --> 00:19:35,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing people play rock bands from different countries, and yes, I did hear somebody from China try to sing Black Hole Sun, and it was kind of funny, but that's very mean, but it was a great, great event.

350
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:42,414
[SPEAKER_09]: The next one is in Cologne, Germany, so any new European listeners that aren't on the radio, I recommend you take the trip out and go.

351
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:46,296
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Tyrant and I are actually thinking about going, so maybe we'll see you there.

352
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,438
[SPEAKER_09]: But more

353
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, I'm walking about downtown Seattle as I do this.

354
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:54,886
[SPEAKER_09]: But for Orange Lounge Radio, I'm Insanus.

355
00:19:55,267 --> 00:20:02,638
[SPEAKER_09]: To hear more about this, listen to our show, The Insanus Hour, featuring SPFU, every Thursday at 7.30 Pacific Time.

356
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Until then, I'm Insanus.

357
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:05,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

358
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:10,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Insanus, for your little report there from the World Cyber Games.

359
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,034
[SPEAKER_15]: He was raving about it.

360
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:14,135
[SPEAKER_15]: He was calling me literally every day about something that was going on.

361
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:15,256
[SPEAKER_15]: He called me the other day.

362
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:21,258
[SPEAKER_15]: He was like, hey, Rob, I got to play one of the other all-game shows in some press competition, and I beat them.

363
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:22,419
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, go.

364
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:24,340
[SPEAKER_15]: You sound like you're having a lot of fun.

365
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully one of those games is Chromehounds because I stole that in my copy.

366
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:30,302
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was Madden.

367
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,184
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think he was actually playing all-games interactive.

368
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:34,344
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he was playing one of the other shows there.

369
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:36,045
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to say it was Game Addict Hotline.

370
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:43,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, the real losers of Chromehounds would be anyone that bought the game, unfortunately.

371
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:49,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, Loki, if I heard you right during the tape segment there, you were dissing World Cyber Games a little bit.

372
00:20:49,455 --> 00:20:50,115
[SPEAKER_15]: What's your issue?

373
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:51,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's stupid.

374
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:51,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

375
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:57,257
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool that, I guess, a bunch of people come together, but don't refer to it as the fucking Olympics or anything like that.

376
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:58,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously.

377
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:05,137
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, the World Cyber Games kind of reminds me of the professional gaming leagues and shit like that.

378
00:21:05,238 --> 00:21:06,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking hate those.

379
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:06,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

380
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,060
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like trying to launch the fucking XFL.

381
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's retarded.

382
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,663
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's going to want to watch you play games.

383
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:13,123
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.

384
00:21:13,143 --> 00:21:14,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't broadcast it.

385
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:15,425
[SPEAKER_02]: It's boring.

386
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:16,786
[SPEAKER_15]: The XFL was actually kind of fun.

387
00:21:18,148 --> 00:21:18,749
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

388
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,206
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the most boring thing to watch.

389
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:42,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the problem was the way they put it together.

390
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:47,190
[SPEAKER_15]: They picked up kids off the street and tried to make it all rad.

391
00:21:47,310 --> 00:22:05,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the problem is, if they're going to do something like this, they need to design games that are meant for this type of gameplay or anything like that, like Unreal Tournament or something, where you could actually set it up, film it like you're doing an actual football or sporting event type of game.

392
00:22:06,102 --> 00:22:06,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Just...

393
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:08,420
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

394
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:27,537
[SPEAKER_05]: If you watch it on TV, you can turn it off.

395
00:22:41,546 --> 00:22:46,468
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't take much to go, you know, ooh, look at me, I'm fast at the reflexes, you know, who cares?

396
00:22:46,568 --> 00:22:48,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it doesn't take much to really build yourself up.

397
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:51,871
[SPEAKER_15]: I know a lot of people that are fascinated with watching people play video games.

398
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:53,671
[SPEAKER_11]: We've all got that friend that's like, hey, you want to play?

399
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:54,592
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'll just watch.

400
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:55,952
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's like, okay.

401
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:57,513
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're like having a good time watching you.

402
00:22:57,993 --> 00:23:00,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Rice Princess, she's always like, I'm going to watch you.

403
00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:01,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Spoilers.

404
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:02,975
[SPEAKER_15]: That's like my roommate.

405
00:23:03,055 --> 00:23:06,597
[SPEAKER_15]: He doesn't really play video games, but he's always kind of like, hey, aren't you going to play Eternal Sonata again?

406
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,338
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I kind of want to know what happens.

407
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Why'd you quit at Chapter 5?

408
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:14,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I like doing cooperative gaming.

409
00:23:15,022 --> 00:23:18,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Not like where both of you are actually playing the game, but like what Dan and I used to do.

410
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:19,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Where, um...

411
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:26,961
[SPEAKER_04]: He would, like, when we played Resident Evil, he would play through the game and I would go off the strategy guide or tell him where to go.

412
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:27,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, bonding time.

413
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but see, that's all storyline stuff.

414
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,704
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know what happens in the storyline and stuff like that.

415
00:23:32,024 --> 00:23:35,807
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little different than saying, oh, I want to watch it because you're so lead at fucking Halo.

416
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:36,547
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

417
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:38,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, that's a little different.

418
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:43,011
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like... I was watching Halo for the storyline, but then it stopped making sense.

419
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:44,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, it's different.

420
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:46,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there even a storyline?

421
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:46,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

422
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:50,514
[SPEAKER_02]: You're tuning in for, like, the story and not for the actual gameplay.

423
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:59,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I don't know why Halo 3 bothered with the story, for real, because, like, I was playing co-op mode the other day, and, like, you know, we're walking through and what have you, and we're shooting aliens, we're having a fun time.

424
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:01,256
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you what, Halo 3 co-op mode is awesome.

425
00:24:01,516 --> 00:24:04,957
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going through, and then suddenly Cortana's like, find me, you gotta find me.

426
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:06,597
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, bitch, get off the screen!

427
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:07,698
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to kill things!

428
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:13,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, you got like so straight for a second there, that was like scary.

429
00:24:13,502 --> 00:24:20,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the funny thing about that, Rob, since I haven't played any of the other games, I don't understand the significance of finding her in the first place.

430
00:24:20,107 --> 00:24:23,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it's just a fucking computer, just let it go, come on, seriously.

431
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought she got exploded.

432
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:26,953
[SPEAKER_02]: By a new chick, I mean, seriously.

433
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:29,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

434
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:33,472
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I lost a little something for not playing the other games, but I digress.

435
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so anyway, wow.

436
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:41,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Really quickly though, people, what about the calls where people are like, I want to see DDR in the Olympics?

437
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:41,955
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

438
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:43,836
[SPEAKER_15]: You are stupid!

439
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:44,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on, hold on.

440
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:48,597
[SPEAKER_15]: What about this as an outlet for those people that want to see that?

441
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:56,599
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there are people that want to do gaming as a competitive sport, and people that feel that, you know, why should gaming be any different from other sports that are outdoors?

442
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:57,219
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

443
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:01,380
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to have gaming as a competitive sport, just do PvP mode on Ragnarok.

444
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,501
[SPEAKER_04]: End of story.

445
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:05,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations, everybody.

446
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:08,142
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura has leveled down the show.

447
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:08,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Good job.

448
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:10,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Hard times.

449
00:25:14,636 --> 00:25:14,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

450
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:16,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I got the finger.

451
00:25:16,837 --> 00:25:19,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you put that finger up so the Op-11 people can see it on the cam.

452
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:19,639
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

453
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:20,419
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

454
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Going to the chat room, because, God, we haven't been paying attention to chat.

455
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:25,202
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so sorry, folks.

456
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:26,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Chat.orangeandredo.com.

457
00:25:28,625 --> 00:25:29,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Macman baby kicker.

458
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:30,286
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

459
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:32,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Why would you kick babies?

460
00:25:33,027 --> 00:25:33,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Shane.

461
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:34,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Why?

462
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:40,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Macman says Cortana is significantly less hot in Halo 3, so therefore she doesn't deserve to be saved, apparently.

463
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:41,853
[SPEAKER_04]: She wasn't hot in the first Halo.

464
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not real!

465
00:25:42,854 --> 00:25:42,894
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

466
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,828
[SPEAKER_15]: DDRDollarBill says, no DDR in the Olympics.

467
00:25:46,988 --> 00:25:47,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I found that ironic.

468
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:53,492
[SPEAKER_02]: If she was a real chick or something, it might make more sense that you're trying to save her, but she's a fucking computer program.

469
00:25:53,673 --> 00:25:54,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a copy!

470
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:58,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, don't copy that floppy.

471
00:25:59,617 --> 00:26:02,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Tigerclaw says, video games are becoming a spectator sport.

472
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,583
[SPEAKER_15]: SonofDad says, didn't they broadcast some of the fighting game championships recently in Japan?

473
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:10,197
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's Japan.

474
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:11,617
[SPEAKER_02]: They put weird shit on their TV.

475
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:12,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, though?

476
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:15,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect them for that, because there's some cool shit on there.

477
00:26:16,738 --> 00:26:23,159
[SPEAKER_02]: If only they'd fucking fill G4 full of all that cool shit in Japan, I might be willing to watch that channel.

478
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,440
[SPEAKER_02]: They try, but they fail.

479
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so, yeah, I mean, okay.

480
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,300
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkShy brings up a good point.

481
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:29,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, please.

482
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen King of Kong.

483
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:31,421
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very interesting.

484
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:35,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, DarkShy says they had a movie called King of Kong, by the way.

485
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:36,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

486
00:26:37,342 --> 00:26:38,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was about the...

487
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,150
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

488
00:26:51,838 --> 00:26:53,239
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was this big drama.

489
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I would suggest to everybody watch through King of Kong.

490
00:26:56,322 --> 00:26:59,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, see, now, that's a good example because people got really into that.

491
00:26:59,305 --> 00:27:05,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I haven't seen the movie yet, but from what I've heard, people really get into it and are like rooting for one guy over the other guy.

492
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,615
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, what about that for your whole argument where people don't want to... It's like Tommy.

493
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:15,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to E. Kim in the chat room, the DDR show did not count.

494
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on, you've got to read what they said before you respond to it.

495
00:27:18,851 --> 00:27:19,491
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, Radio 101.

496
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:22,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Ecom in the chat says, what did he say?

497
00:27:22,952 --> 00:27:23,512
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I lost it.

498
00:27:23,552 --> 00:27:23,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yes.

499
00:27:23,812 --> 00:27:26,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I need to remind you of that crap DDR show on TV?

500
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:27,873
[SPEAKER_15]: To which you say, it doesn't count.

501
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:29,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not?

502
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:37,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at first it was called Dance Revolution, and all it was was just fucking Mickey Mouse Club ripoff with the slumber party girls.

503
00:27:38,214 --> 00:27:39,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are they now?

504
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:39,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.

505
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:41,455
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's listening to them.

506
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:42,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, how sad.

507
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:43,855
[SPEAKER_02]: So sad.

508
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet another girl group gone.

509
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:46,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Aw.

510
00:27:46,256 --> 00:27:46,956
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

511
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow, other housekeeping real quick.

512
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,131
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got to say this.

513
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:53,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember how last week we got a lot of phone calls on Digital Life?

514
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:56,391
[SPEAKER_15]: I even had to hang up on one caller over drama and all that stuff.

515
00:27:56,411 --> 00:28:01,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, SSJ, Matt, one of our listeners, was kind enough to send us a care package from Digital Life.

516
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,453
[SPEAKER_15]: So we got stuff from Digital Life.

517
00:28:04,273 --> 00:28:05,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we have this little squeeze brain.

518
00:28:05,773 --> 00:28:07,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like 50 of those.

519
00:28:07,533 --> 00:28:09,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, then Eddie seemed to be interested in that.

520
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:10,334
[SPEAKER_15]: So there you go, Eddie.

521
00:28:11,054 --> 00:28:11,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see what we have here.

522
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:16,235
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a seven-day free trial of Lord of the Rings Online.

523
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:17,175
[SPEAKER_15]: You want that?

524
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:18,714
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have an Xbox.

525
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:39,920
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it works.

526
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,661
[SPEAKER_15]: I have my battery.

527
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:42,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Non-working flashlight.

528
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:43,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

529
00:28:43,684 --> 00:28:44,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Look at this.

530
00:28:44,185 --> 00:28:46,828
[SPEAKER_15]: All these V-Rares for DDR Universe.

531
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:47,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take one.

532
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:49,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, is that the original universe or second one?

533
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:50,472
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's the original universe.

534
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:51,714
[SPEAKER_15]: DDR Universe.

535
00:28:51,734 --> 00:28:52,475
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll take one anyways.

536
00:28:52,535 --> 00:28:53,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I might have one, but I'd take one anyway.

537
00:28:54,016 --> 00:28:54,377
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, here you go.

538
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:55,642
[SPEAKER_15]: And there you go.

539
00:28:55,662 --> 00:28:56,523
[SPEAKER_15]: This is exciting radio.

540
00:28:56,543 --> 00:28:56,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at this.

541
00:28:57,084 --> 00:28:59,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Party gift for us.

542
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:02,828
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to joke.

543
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:03,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And here they are.

544
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Now this I might keep and give away at some point because this is old.

545
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:09,994
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a DDR Max sampler from Toys R Us.

546
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,776
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think they even make these anymore.

547
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:13,037
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll hang on to that.

548
00:29:13,057 --> 00:29:14,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you want a universe sampler, puppy?

549
00:29:14,478 --> 00:29:15,179
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, there you go.

550
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody wins here at Orange Launch Radio.

551
00:29:18,662 --> 00:29:19,302
[SPEAKER_15]: I got a brain.

552
00:29:20,203 --> 00:29:20,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

553
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:21,384
[SPEAKER_15]: What else do we have here?

554
00:29:22,413 --> 00:29:26,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Loki's gonna love this.

555
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:28,096
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's no money.

556
00:29:28,136 --> 00:29:28,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this.

557
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:29,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

558
00:29:29,897 --> 00:29:32,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Authentic Eye of Judgment cards.

559
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:32,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Look at this.

560
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:37,221
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a card for the Biolith Bomber from the Eye of Judgment.

561
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:38,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Check that shit out right there.

562
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:40,823
[SPEAKER_15]: It even says right on the back, the Eye of Judgment.

563
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:42,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait.

564
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:42,483
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

565
00:29:43,084 --> 00:29:44,605
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna make a copy of this.

566
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:46,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you do that.

567
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:47,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

568
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:49,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be so impossible to copy.

569
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:51,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, no it won't be.

570
00:29:53,314 --> 00:29:58,895
[SPEAKER_15]: A little doggy keychain there from Sirius Satellite Radio.

571
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:00,036
[SPEAKER_06]: A puppy should have that.

572
00:30:00,176 --> 00:30:00,876
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it is a puppy.

573
00:30:00,996 --> 00:30:02,316
[SPEAKER_15]: So a puppy gets the puppy keychain.

574
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:02,776
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

575
00:30:03,536 --> 00:30:04,057
[SPEAKER_15]: And let's see.

576
00:30:05,077 --> 00:30:07,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, some post-it notes from Newegg.

577
00:30:07,877 --> 00:30:09,178
[SPEAKER_15]: Who wants post-it notes from Newegg?

578
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:09,898
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura does.

579
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:10,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Posties.

580
00:30:10,318 --> 00:30:10,638
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

581
00:30:11,238 --> 00:30:11,918
[SPEAKER_15]: And, oh, I like this.

582
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:12,359
[SPEAKER_15]: What is this?

583
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:15,899
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a little, what is this, an iPod mini skin?

584
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,700
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what this is.

585
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:20,820
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't tell.

586
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:22,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it an eraser?

587
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:24,628
[SPEAKER_15]: What is it?

588
00:30:25,228 --> 00:30:26,489
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like an eraser.

589
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

590
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:33,335
[SPEAKER_15]: And last but not least, last but not least, a lollipop with a ghost on it from Pac-Man.

591
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:33,815
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

592
00:30:34,155 --> 00:30:35,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's adorable.

593
00:30:35,176 --> 00:30:36,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't anybody eat that.

594
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:37,958
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just keep it forever and ever.

595
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:39,019
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our new mascot.

596
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:39,539
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

597
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:40,520
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, totally.

598
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:44,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, SSJ100Map, for the fabulous gifts and prizes.

599
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:44,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate it.

600
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:45,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

601
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:50,488
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no way that these things will not be able to, you know,

602
00:30:53,778 --> 00:31:03,726
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's an advertisement for one other company that makes iPod skins called Jealous Skins but they didn't actually put a real one on there.

603
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:12,192
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a piece of plastic that looks like an iPod with a fake one around it and something on the back that says take this to the booth and get two for one or something.

604
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:16,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Well somebody forgot to take it to the booth so we get it now here in studio.

605
00:31:16,996 --> 00:31:18,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the prizes from Digital Life.

606
00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:19,178
[SPEAKER_15]: We appreciate it.

607
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:21,254
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I'm going to peel this off.

608
00:31:21,794 --> 00:31:22,094
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

609
00:31:24,355 --> 00:31:24,695
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you?

610
00:31:25,396 --> 00:31:26,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, all right.

611
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:26,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

612
00:31:28,777 --> 00:31:30,318
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess that's it for housekeeping tonight.

613
00:31:30,959 --> 00:31:31,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Finally.

614
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,100
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're only about 35 minutes into tonight's show.

615
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,361
[SPEAKER_15]: We can finally get into some gaming news.

616
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:38,662
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

617
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:39,723
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting with Ding.

618
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:49,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so there is some interesting rumors going around about a brand new Wii SKU and everyone's all like, oh my god, what is this?

619
00:31:50,036 --> 00:31:51,396
[SPEAKER_02]: It's DVD or something?

620
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:52,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be playing?

621
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:53,198
[SPEAKER_02]: No, don't get excited.

622
00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:54,338
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nothing, actually.

623
00:31:54,879 --> 00:32:02,343
[SPEAKER_02]: The brand new UPC or new pack, as it's being dubbed, all it really is, and I've seen this happen on a few different consoles...

624
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:05,135
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just them changing the box art.

625
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:09,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you know, those launch games, they're a little old and dusty right now.

626
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:12,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Time to put the new shit on there, you know, to get people excited.

627
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,417
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it is.

628
00:32:14,797 --> 00:32:15,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, box art!

629
00:32:15,677 --> 00:32:16,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god!

630
00:32:16,898 --> 00:32:22,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they did the exact same thing in September with the PS2 Slim.

631
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:27,721
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the same thing with the PSP, the fat system, back in like June.

632
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:31,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's... It happens all the time.

633
00:32:31,422 --> 00:32:31,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So just...

634
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:34,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't get excited.

635
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:35,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Calm down.

636
00:32:35,232 --> 00:32:39,057
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're getting excited, you're like, oh my god, they're finally going to release the pink Wii.

637
00:32:39,197 --> 00:32:41,219
[SPEAKER_15]: You're like, get over it.

638
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:46,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, they're not releasing any more colors because they're still not having trouble selling the original system.

639
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:47,887
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't make enough.

640
00:32:48,328 --> 00:32:52,553
[SPEAKER_02]: When it starts to slow down and people stop buying them, that's when the new colors will come.

641
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:57,455
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like a GameStop, like if you buy a new DS, they're giving away a Zelda frame that's made of cardboard.

642
00:32:57,795 --> 00:32:59,217
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, I have a DS.

643
00:32:59,337 --> 00:33:00,458
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's like, but it's super rare.

644
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:03,160
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, so are the $120 to buy a new DS.

645
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's like, good times.

646
00:33:06,964 --> 00:33:07,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Not really.

647
00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:09,206
[SPEAKER_15]: You wanted to punch him, didn't you?

648
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,700
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

649
00:33:31,914 --> 00:33:34,316
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura actually got the thing off of the iPod.

650
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:35,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Now it's just a piece of plastic.

651
00:33:35,396 --> 00:33:35,857
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't get anything.

652
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:01,895
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm mixing up the fake radio names, sorry.

653
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:05,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is like duct tape.

654
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:07,588
[SPEAKER_02]: It's printed duct tape.

655
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:13,723
[SPEAKER_15]: This is wonderful radio, you taking apart one of our three little things.

656
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome sounds there, doing that.

657
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:22,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, hey, you know, since, Eddie, you're very sad that you can't get anything free from buying Zelda, you can get this as a Wii owner.

658
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:26,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Nintendo is now giving away a Wii Remote Jacket.

659
00:34:27,014 --> 00:34:34,241
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right, this week Nintendo put out a press release that now there's this new sleeve that's coming out for the Wiimotes.

660
00:34:34,801 --> 00:34:36,623
[SPEAKER_15]: And let me start off by saying it's really ugly.

661
00:34:37,584 --> 00:34:38,885
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's better?

662
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:41,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Nerf did the same thing, and Nerf actually looks cool.

663
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:45,671
[SPEAKER_15]: It basically makes your Wiimote look like an Egyptian mummy.

664
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:50,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I'd say it looks more like they're trying to... Except they didn't have plastic in ancient Egypt, Rob.

665
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:53,258
[SPEAKER_14]: They're trying to retard-proof the controller.

666
00:34:53,478 --> 00:34:57,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, basically this is so that when you accidentally throw it at your TV because you're an idiot, it will bounce.

667
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Or somebody else is like, so you don't hit people in the head with it.

668
00:35:00,304 --> 00:35:01,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, what?! !

669
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:07,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I noticed all the padding's on the front of it, so obviously it's for projectiles flying against stuff.

670
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:10,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, you'll wee your eye out.

671
00:35:11,258 --> 00:35:18,985
[SPEAKER_15]: These are going to be shipped with all new Wii consoles, Wii remotes, and of course copies of Wii Play, because the Wiimotes come with them, starting October 2nd.

672
00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:21,747
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that means they should be on shelves by October 15th.

673
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:25,891
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, maybe that's what the new SKU is then, since it was for October 2nd.

674
00:35:27,232 --> 00:35:31,035
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go to Nintendo.com too and get your own free one.

675
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:35,840
[SPEAKER_15]: And then maybe that's the new box art is on the box that says, Now with free Egyptian tombs.

676
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,681
[SPEAKER_02]: No, here's going to be the best part, though, about it.

677
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:45,626
[SPEAKER_02]: If it does ship with the Wii console and stuff like that, who's to say someone actually is going to put it on their Wii remote?

678
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:48,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Little shot there of Tootin' Common playing Wii Tennis.

679
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:49,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

680
00:35:49,728 --> 00:35:52,890
[SPEAKER_02]: That pretty much killed the market for those stupid Wii gloves now.

681
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:58,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Son of Dad wants to know, do the Wii condoms have lubricant on them?

682
00:35:59,154 --> 00:35:59,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

683
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:01,515
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but they are ribbed for her pleasure.

684
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Have these Wiimotes inspired some type of new sick fetish?

685
00:36:03,837 --> 00:36:04,857
[SPEAKER_15]: That's disgusting.

686
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:06,018
[SPEAKER_15]: What's wrong with you people?

687
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:10,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Neoprenism Make sure to ask for them to be ribbed for her pleasure I want them ribbed for my pleasure, please

688
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:39,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on a minute here.

689
00:36:40,977 --> 00:36:43,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Can somebody go grab my Wii so I can get that serial number off it?

690
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:44,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if anybody's actually going to answer.

691
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for calling Nintendo's Wii Remote Jacket Accessory Offer Line.

692
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:50,365
[SPEAKER_00]: For assistance in English, press 1.

693
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:01,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for calling Nintendo's Wii Remote Jacket Accessory Offer Line.

694
00:37:01,835 --> 00:37:03,357
[SPEAKER_00]: For assistance in English, press 1.

695
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's my number pad?

696
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:06,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's my keypad?

697
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:09,271
[SPEAKER_15]: There we go.

698
00:37:15,874 --> 00:37:17,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for calling Nintendo Consumer Services.

699
00:37:17,554 --> 00:37:18,195
[SPEAKER_01]: This is ***.

700
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:18,915
[SPEAKER_01]: How may I help you?

701
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:22,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I wanted to order the Wiimote jackets for my Wii.

702
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:29,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you already go online and try, or is this your first attempt?

703
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:30,180
[SPEAKER_15]: This is my first attempt.

704
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,180
[SPEAKER_15]: It said I could call the number.

705
00:37:36,064 --> 00:37:40,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just checking because we have quite a few people who tried online and had some difficulties.

706
00:37:40,086 --> 00:37:41,247
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I was... Ah, forget it.

707
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:42,247
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to bother with her.

708
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:47,670
[SPEAKER_15]: That's so mean.

709
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Just go put this back.

710
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:53,133
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, was she just going to belittle me?

711
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:59,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sir, I... I'm kind of like the stupid type, so... What's wrong with you, fool?

712
00:38:05,217 --> 00:38:06,357
[SPEAKER_12]: What's wrong with you, moron?

713
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:09,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Why don't you go on the website?

714
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:15,101
[SPEAKER_11]: At least we know it works, though.

715
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:17,141
[SPEAKER_15]: The whole chat room.

716
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:17,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

717
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:20,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Drew Nami says, don't fucking disrespect the call center rep.

718
00:38:20,903 --> 00:38:21,383
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not.

719
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:22,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

720
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:24,064
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Rob?

721
00:38:24,124 --> 00:38:24,324
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

722
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:26,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked in a call center for five years.

723
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:26,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

724
00:38:27,265 --> 00:38:27,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

725
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:36,376
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the point if you tried online or not?

726
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:37,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you try online?

727
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:40,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Because really, I don't want to help you right now.

728
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:43,978
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could just try online, that would make my life a whole lot easier.

729
00:38:44,399 --> 00:38:45,899
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't have to do my job.

730
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:50,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I often do stuff like that because when you work in a call center, you usually have a time limit on how long you can take a call or else you get written up.

731
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:52,950
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

732
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Wonder.Carol said that call center rep was actually nice.

733
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,556
[SPEAKER_15]: She was, but she was told... Well, she gave you an explanation.

734
00:38:58,576 --> 00:38:59,917
[SPEAKER_11]: They probably make her ask that.

735
00:39:00,117 --> 00:39:00,678
[SPEAKER_11]: It was scripted.

736
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:02,360
[SPEAKER_15]: You can tell what scripting sounds like.

737
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

738
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:03,881
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

739
00:39:06,984 --> 00:39:08,606
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, let's just move on with the show already.

740
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:12,490
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, Rob, never give me kettle corn again.

741
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,651
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got cocaine in it.

742
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:15,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway...

743
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:18,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Virtual Console for the UK.

744
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:19,779
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone's interested.

745
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:22,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first one makes me just totally go WTF.

746
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:25,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I actually own the original of this game.

747
00:39:26,203 --> 00:39:27,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Fatal Fury for Neo Geo.

748
00:39:28,024 --> 00:39:28,564
[SPEAKER_04]: 900 Wii Points.

749
00:39:29,885 --> 00:39:33,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Translates to 9 euro, 675 pound.

750
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:37,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's the Neo Geo game.

751
00:39:37,649 --> 00:39:38,469
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Fatal Fury.

752
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:39,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Next.

753
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:42,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey look, Streets of Rage 3.

754
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:44,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is actually a pretty good game.

755
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:48,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss the old beat-em-up games like that.

756
00:39:49,411 --> 00:39:52,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Although nothing was ever as awesome as Battletoads and Double Dragon.

757
00:39:55,293 --> 00:40:06,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And moving forward, as soon as it decides to load, Golden Axe 3 at 800 Wii points, which was also, as it was known in the UK, Sega Mega Drive, which for us was the Genesis.

758
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:10,659
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, Genesis does what Nintendo don't.

759
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:18,769
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, another Mega Drive game for 800 Wii Points, Super Thunder Blade, which actually wasn't all that fun.

760
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:25,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but not least, Landstalker, The Treasure of the King Gnoll.

761
00:40:25,952 --> 00:40:30,154
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Treasure of King Gnoll, another Mega Drive game, which I don't actually think was fun either.

762
00:40:31,315 --> 00:40:31,875
[SPEAKER_04]: End of story.

763
00:40:33,936 --> 00:40:35,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyways.

764
00:40:36,399 --> 00:40:50,966
[SPEAKER_02]: So, someday, there will be some more titles for the WiiWare service, because right now all there is is a couple channels for the Wii, but one title promised for early 2008 is going to be a game called Gravitronics.

765
00:40:51,787 --> 00:41:04,253
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being put out by developer Metaverse, and it's going to be a game, I guess, supporting up to eight players, and I guess it's going to be assaulting enemy territories using shapes.

766
00:41:05,353 --> 00:41:05,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet.

767
00:41:06,513 --> 00:41:07,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So, death by shapes.

768
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:14,636
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the deal with that whole, because I'm, speaking as a Nintendo fanboy, they were supposed to, like, have all this stuff, like, ready to go at launch.

769
00:41:15,136 --> 00:41:21,898
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's, like, a year later, they're still doing three games a week, and there's, like, literally hundreds of games between these three systems.

770
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:26,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Or, Eddie, did you try going online and filling out the form to ask the question?

771
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, you know.

772
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,420
[SPEAKER_15]: I should, huh?

773
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,340
[SPEAKER_15]: I should, like, call them up and be like, bitch.

774
00:41:29,581 --> 00:41:30,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay.

775
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:31,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's one thing that.

776
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:37,353
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the games, first off, weren't rated by the ESRB, so a lot of those had to go through that again.

777
00:41:37,373 --> 00:41:41,556
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them also, they have to be made to work with the emulators.

778
00:41:41,976 --> 00:41:43,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and stuff like that.

779
00:41:43,177 --> 00:41:45,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, they don't give a fuck what you care!

780
00:41:46,098 --> 00:41:49,540
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, we're fucking Nintendo, you can't buy our fucking system.

781
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the fuck do you want to get online anyways?

782
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:54,383
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get your fucking system first before you can get fucking online.

783
00:41:54,903 --> 00:41:56,644
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I know the semantics, but...

784
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:03,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo Online?

785
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a scary world, that online out there.

786
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:29,923
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the Opera browser is awesome.

787
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:33,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I like doing that on my TV, but there's really nothing else for Nintendo Online.

788
00:42:34,325 --> 00:42:34,985
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there should be.

789
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:36,573
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

790
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,988
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, oh my god, Nintendo caused the kid to get raped.

791
00:42:59,408 --> 00:42:59,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no.

792
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:02,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like the fucking Wii Jacket shit.

793
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no reason that they need to improve stuff.

794
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:14,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obviously idiotic people throwing shit through their goddamn TV and now you have this, like, stupid, like, foam shit on the, like, fucking remote that's gonna...

795
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess Protector TV.

796
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:16,601
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

797
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:17,361
[SPEAKER_04]: The hell it will.

798
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:18,941
[SPEAKER_02]: People will find more ways to do this.

799
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:30,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Until this stupid thing that the Wii is going to sit in, the remote, it's going to be like this giant foam protective thing that's going to look like you're waving around a giant retarded glove or something.

800
00:43:30,785 --> 00:43:31,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously.

801
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,606
[SPEAKER_02]: They're idiotic people.

802
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,747
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need to get over that fact and just...

803
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:37,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Start making better shit.

804
00:43:37,632 --> 00:43:40,333
[SPEAKER_04]: How should Nintendo be responsible for somebody else's idiocy?

805
00:43:40,733 --> 00:43:48,416
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no amount of protection that they're going to be able to give for these remotes to cause people not to play.

806
00:43:48,456 --> 00:43:50,017
[SPEAKER_11]: You should actually hold on to the Wiimote.

807
00:43:50,717 --> 00:43:52,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if somebody does...

808
00:43:53,095 --> 00:43:57,697
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, completely disregard an instruction that is blatantly written on the product.

809
00:43:57,757 --> 00:44:01,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Like five minutes before every game starts, it's like, be careful, the Wiimote.

810
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:14,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have an example for you, and this doesn't necessarily have to do with a video game, but this is a primary example of how somebody can still basically bypass an entire law to get money out of a company.

811
00:44:14,343 --> 00:44:20,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I studied this in my business law class, so this is back to business law.

812
00:44:20,885 --> 00:44:22,366
[SPEAKER_04]: This person had a weed whacker.

813
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:27,105
[SPEAKER_04]: and it said children under the age of so and such should not be allowed anywhere near it.

814
00:44:27,506 --> 00:44:28,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not swing it back.

815
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:29,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not do this.

816
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:33,029
[SPEAKER_04]: The company is not responsible if this is the circumstance.

817
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:39,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this kid was following his uncle around following this weed whacker and it bounced off of a rock which was not a fault of the machine.

818
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:40,574
[SPEAKER_04]: It was physics.

819
00:44:41,214 --> 00:44:44,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Reach back and cut off this kid's leg.

820
00:44:45,076 --> 00:44:45,376
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

821
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:51,040
[SPEAKER_04]: All of the things led up that it was operator error.

822
00:44:52,338 --> 00:44:53,458
[SPEAKER_04]: It was full operator error.

823
00:44:53,698 --> 00:44:55,919
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not the fault of the product, and they disregarded all the things.

824
00:44:55,979 --> 00:44:58,700
[SPEAKER_04]: However, they managed to get somewhere close to $2 million out of the company.

825
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:03,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I use that as my primary example.

826
00:45:03,642 --> 00:45:09,864
[SPEAKER_04]: If Nintendo wants to be careful, then more power to them, because they're going to find ways to bleed them dry if something like that happened.

827
00:45:10,764 --> 00:45:11,004
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

828
00:45:11,604 --> 00:45:15,185
[SPEAKER_15]: In the interest of keeping the show under four hours tonight, we've got to move on to the next story.

829
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:17,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of good points tonight, but we've got to keep it moving.

830
00:45:17,779 --> 00:45:18,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Halo DS Halo DS

831
00:45:44,318 --> 00:46:03,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, here's the thing, though, is that actually what happened is that apparently somebody was actually modifying an engine of another game to show that Halo DS could be done and Halo DS could be ported, and it was something that had come as an idea, like, hey, why don't you let us develop a DS port of Halo, to which the answer was a resounding no.

832
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:05,250
[SPEAKER_15]: And Halo's boring.

833
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:05,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

834
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:35,964
[SPEAKER_15]: If it had Wi-Fi network, it might be pretty cool and have the same multiplayer capabilities.

835
00:46:35,984 --> 00:46:40,088
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think, although honestly, you know, I just wish for Duke Nukem 3D on DS.

836
00:46:40,328 --> 00:46:40,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Heck yeah.

837
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:43,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Along with the text, with the voice macros.

838
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:45,953
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they do not need Duke Nukem 3D on the DS.

839
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:47,595
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to fucking finish Duke Nukem Forever.

840
00:46:48,268 --> 00:46:49,069
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're getting Ike.

841
00:47:17,261 --> 00:47:18,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Lucas, Mother 3, and The Wizard

842
00:47:38,283 --> 00:47:44,125
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as Lucas still has the ability to do PK Fire and PK Cross and all that cheap bullshit, then I'll be very happy.

843
00:47:44,145 --> 00:47:47,927
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they should build one of those wireless communicators with Super Master.

844
00:47:48,547 --> 00:47:54,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Your mic is going crazy, Eddie, so we're going to unplug it, and you're going to have to borrow one of the other mics from now on, because the chat room is complaining about you.

845
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's cutting in and out.

846
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:56,330
[SPEAKER_15]: They can't hear it.

847
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:56,791
[SPEAKER_15]: They can't hear it.

848
00:47:56,811 --> 00:47:57,711
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to use another mic.

849
00:47:58,171 --> 00:47:58,451
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on.

850
00:47:58,531 --> 00:47:59,232
[SPEAKER_15]: This is on a commission.

851
00:47:59,852 --> 00:48:00,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, darn.

852
00:48:01,152 --> 00:48:01,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Eddie.

853
00:48:02,273 --> 00:48:02,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

854
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:09,826
[SPEAKER_02]: In other news, the Wii is not going to meet the demand for this holiday.

855
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:20,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So in case you were waiting for some magical delivery of Wii systems that was going to be able to put out millions and millions of units in the United States, think again.

856
00:48:20,837 --> 00:48:21,738
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to happen.

857
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:25,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Reggie actually kind of originally claimed that there was going to be...

858
00:48:27,015 --> 00:48:30,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Plenty of units out there, but then went back to retract that statement.

859
00:48:31,278 --> 00:48:39,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, they're trying to up the quantities coming to the United States, but still they're not going to be able to make it.

860
00:48:40,643 --> 00:48:42,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess that's good that they're selling units.

861
00:48:42,984 --> 00:48:49,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's still crappy, though, that after a year being out, they can't fucking produce more of these.

862
00:48:49,608 --> 00:48:53,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think that there's anything in them that's really that revolutionary.

863
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

864
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:01,069
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can find one, buy one.

865
00:49:01,129 --> 00:49:02,850
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the recommendation.

866
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you want to get one for Christmas.

867
00:49:07,593 --> 00:49:08,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Alrighty.

868
00:49:08,614 --> 00:49:09,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, good luck.

869
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:12,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully there won't be all the camping out and everything that people have to do again this time.

870
00:49:13,077 --> 00:49:14,537
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be kind of sucky.

871
00:49:15,298 --> 00:49:15,598
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

872
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:21,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, there's been some titles announced for the Neo Geo

873
00:49:22,461 --> 00:49:24,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but then again I paid about $100 for the cart, so...

874
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:45,643
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

875
00:50:16,107 --> 00:50:18,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, and her boobs come out when you knock her out.

876
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:29,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, other potential title coming out on the virtual console, at least the ESRB's put out ratings for it, is we have Echo Jr.

877
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:36,900
[SPEAKER_04]: and Eternal Champions, which I love Eternal Champions, but I like Eternal Champions CD better, with the CineKills.

878
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are so great.

879
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:43,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic 3D Blast and Light Crusader also have ratings out on them.

880
00:50:44,716 --> 00:50:45,416
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

881
00:50:46,397 --> 00:50:47,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

882
00:50:48,117 --> 00:50:49,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Vectorman.

883
00:50:50,578 --> 00:50:53,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's plenty of other stuff coming out in the U.S.

884
00:50:53,499 --> 00:50:53,999
[SPEAKER_02]: this week.

885
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:05,923
[SPEAKER_02]: This week, we're going to see releases of such wonderfully average games as Looney Tunes Acme Arsenal coming out on PlayStation 2, 360, and the Wii.

886
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:09,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Looney Tunes Duck Amok on the DS.

887
00:51:12,281 --> 00:51:18,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Mountain Bike Adrenaline, a game that's attempting to make mountain biking extreme or something.

888
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:19,748
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out on PlayStation 2.

889
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:26,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Honda SBK07, Superbike, also coming out on PlayStation 2.

890
00:51:27,135 --> 00:51:28,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And Backyard Football 2008.

891
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:31,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the fuck do they still make more of those games?

892
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:33,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they all suck.

930
00:54:30,831 --> 00:54:31,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it might be a point and clicker.

931
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:33,093

934
00:54:46,722 --> 00:54:49,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was looking at that and thinking of Snatcher.

935
00:54:50,668 --> 00:54:57,474
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if it takes longer to beat the game or pronounce the title, so it's all right there.

936
00:54:59,276 --> 00:55:02,659
[SPEAKER_15]: And on the Sony PSP, some movies come out for those of you guys.

[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how about somewhere else?

940
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,495
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the sound I make when I'm taking a lady in the water.

941
00:55:23,536 --> 00:55:25,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Leaving sacrifices for the lady in the water.

942
00:55:25,677 --> 00:55:25,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

943
00:55:27,097 --> 00:55:29,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So shall I continue with the UK releases?

944
00:55:29,998 --> 00:55:35,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, really quickly, Alpha Canogram says, Sky, that is the Pac-Man that Miyamoto helped work on.

945
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,481
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's like the, I guess, newer Pac-Man.

946
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:40,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, in that case, let me buy another Pac-Man game.

950

[SPEAKER_02]: I think I forgot to mention one.

951
00:56:29,126 --> 00:56:32,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this week also Donkey Kong Bongo Blast is coming out on the Wii.

952
00:56:34,108 --> 00:56:42,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anyone should get excited about a game that was supposed to be on the GameCube featuring the bongos and now is on the Wii because we need another Wii game and it's a racing game.

953
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:44,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.

954
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:46,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried.

955
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:47,517
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried, guys.

956
00:56:47,557 --> 00:56:47,838
[SPEAKER_15]: I tried.

957
00:56:52,836 --> 00:56:59,462
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously though, there are some other interesting things happening, including more Guitar Hero tracks being revealed.

958
00:56:59,722 --> 00:57:03,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God, there's no surprise when you go play Guitar Hero 3 nowadays.

959
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:08,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Which, by the way, this is how Activision keeps Guitar Hero in the news every week, and it's worked successfully.

960
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Every week there's some damn Guitar Hero 3 update.

961
00:57:11,213 --> 00:57:13,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's only a couple more weeks until this game comes out.

962
00:57:14,876 --> 00:57:17,118
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is some good stuff being announced.

963
00:57:17,759 --> 00:57:19,180
[SPEAKER_02]: When You Were Young by The Killers...

964
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:34,414

[SPEAKER_02]: and The Seeker by The Who and some other shit.

966
00:57:53,256 --> 00:57:54,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Hit me with a wet sock.

967
00:57:55,858 --> 00:57:56,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on!

968
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,261
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

969
00:58:00,301 --> 00:58:02,302
[SPEAKER_15]: It's how we used to sing it at karaoke.

970
00:58:06,105 --> 00:58:10,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Me and my imaginary... Irene, don't say things if you don't have a microphone.

971
00:58:10,748 --> 00:58:13,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously, you ruin the experience for the podcast listeners.

972
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:14,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Us as studio are amused.

973
00:58:16,812 --> 00:58:18,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything else you want to announce on Guitar Hero 3?

974
00:58:19,714 --> 00:58:20,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope.

975
00:58:21,234 --> 00:58:24,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out on the 28th, in case you haven't heard, and that's a Sunday.

976
00:58:25,055 --> 00:58:25,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

977
00:58:26,676 --> 00:58:36,698
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but seriously, though, they're going to have to keep all the attention they can possibly get, because about a month after that is when Rock Band comes out, and then, I don't know.

978
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:39,059
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, a friend of mine used to sing it on stage once.

979
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:41,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Whip me with your big cock.

980
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:42,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on!

981
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,501
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that was not my grandma, you fucking bastard.

982
00:58:49,946 --> 00:58:50,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

983
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:53,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

984
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:54,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow.

985
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on.

986
00:58:57,271 --> 00:59:01,534
[SPEAKER_15]: I will probably not be playing too much of Guitar Hero 3 because I'm too busy being addicted to MMOs.

987
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:06,034
[SPEAKER_15]: and one MMO that maybe I should really check out sometime because I've heard a lot of things about it.

988
00:59:06,134 --> 00:59:08,076
[SPEAKER_15]: City of Heroes.

989
00:59:08,156 --> 00:59:24,746
[SPEAKER_15]: City of Heroes is actually going to be getting a new update called A Stitch in Time where the heroes will get to go into a new universe and get to relive some of the major events that have happened in the past to shape Paragon City, which is where all the City Heroes folks live.

990
00:59:24,907 --> 00:59:28,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, such a ripoff of Final Fantasy XI.

991
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:29,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Not really.

992
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,301
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no.

993
00:59:31,381 --> 00:59:35,023
[SPEAKER_15]: I say no because this is letting them relive events that, you know, these games have been out for years.

994
00:59:35,043 --> 00:59:35,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

995
00:59:35,403 --> 00:59:35,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not serious.

996
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:37,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of the ideas suck.

997
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like they're the first people to ever think of, you know, going back in time.

998
00:59:40,647 --> 00:59:41,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

999
00:59:41,307 --> 00:59:47,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there will be new power sets including dual blades and willpower, new customization, weapons, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1000
00:59:47,712 --> 00:59:49,493
[SPEAKER_15]: City of Heroes fans are excited, I'm sure.

1001
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:53,716
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I still have not checked out City of Heroes, but I've heard good things about chat.

1002
00:59:54,196 --> 00:59:55,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Chat room, tell me about City of Heroes.

1003
00:59:55,537 --> 00:59:56,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Any of you guys play it?

1004
00:59:56,638 --> 00:59:57,558
[SPEAKER_15]: If so, what am I missing?

1005
00:59:57,578 --> 00:59:58,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a few people who do.

1006
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:07,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's got this thing where I think it has some sort of rotating experience thing.

1007
01:00:08,181 --> 01:00:08,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1008
01:00:08,741 --> 01:00:11,542
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the best part of that game would be creating your character.

1009
01:00:12,002 --> 01:00:15,743
[SPEAKER_15]: I could see myself sitting there for an hour in the create your character mode and then that's it.

1010
01:00:15,823 --> 01:00:17,683
[SPEAKER_15]: And then at the end, Stan Lee remakes your costume.

1011
01:00:19,043 --> 01:00:19,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

1012
01:00:20,224 --> 01:00:21,044
[SPEAKER_15]: And I get dismissed.

1013
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:27,025
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to throw away my costume because I'm not a true superhero because I tried to kick the baby.

1014
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:48,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in other MMORPG news, and we all know that MMORPG means many men online roleplaying girls, for those who are playing World of Warcraft, which I am not numbered among you since my computer died, I am playing better games, well, they have done their own version of Oktoberfest in World of Warcraft.

1015
01:00:49,661 --> 01:00:50,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Brewfest.

1016
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:54,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is really what Oktoberfest should be called anyway, don't you think?

1017
01:00:54,502 --> 01:00:56,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you can run around and lederhosen!

1018
01:00:57,057 --> 01:00:57,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And eat pretzels.

1019
01:00:58,397 --> 01:00:58,777
[SPEAKER_04]: In game.

1020
01:01:00,058 --> 01:01:01,858
[SPEAKER_15]: And listen to German polka, which is awesome.

1021
01:01:01,918 --> 01:01:06,399
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what makes it even better is if you actually have significant amounts of alcohol there with you at your computer.

1022
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:15,182
[SPEAKER_15]: You can actually get these things in little brew fest vendors, and if you drink them, they actually give you buffs, they're useful items, but then they make your screen all wavy, and like, it fucks with you.

1023
01:01:15,242 --> 01:01:16,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, if you have a, you know, if, what?

1024
01:01:17,282 --> 01:01:18,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh god, here comes Irene.

1025
01:01:18,523 --> 01:01:19,823
[SPEAKER_05]: How long have you been playing WoW?

1026
01:01:20,441 --> 01:01:22,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they have alcoholic drinks, like, from the end.

1027
01:01:22,982 --> 01:01:24,022
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but this one's different.

1028
01:01:24,062 --> 01:01:27,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, instead of making your screen blurry, this one made my screen, like, pulsate.

1029
01:01:27,883 --> 01:01:28,563
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really weird.

1030
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:31,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I've only ever drank the alcoholic drinks that make the screen blurry.

1031
01:01:31,723 --> 01:01:32,984
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they blur more and more as you drink them.

1032
01:01:33,004 --> 01:01:33,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that kind of sad?

1033
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:36,144
[SPEAKER_05]: People that, like, drink alcohol in-game.

1034
01:01:36,204 --> 01:01:37,865
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I'm too scared to try it.

1035
01:01:37,885 --> 01:01:39,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, everybody tries it once.

1036
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:40,365
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, come on.

1037
01:01:40,605 --> 01:01:41,565
[SPEAKER_05]: In-game.

1038
01:01:41,805 --> 01:01:43,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, yeah, because you want to see what your character's like drunk.

1039
01:01:43,306 --> 01:01:44,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, is this what it's really like?

1040
01:01:44,486 --> 01:01:46,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm never drinking ever again.

1041
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:47,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's pretty sad.

1042
01:01:48,987 --> 01:01:49,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone take the mic.

1043
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:58,624
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'll tell you what happens when you really drink in real life, is you get a bright idea to form an internet radio program with your friends, and then you can't escape it for over 250 weekly episodes.

1044
01:01:58,964 --> 01:02:00,825
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Rob, that's when you're bored on the bart.

1045
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:02,946
[SPEAKER_11]: No, when you get drunk, you marry Irene.

1046
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,447
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, that's a joke.

1047
01:02:06,507 --> 01:02:09,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Eddie tells a funny joke and gets a 10-day resort job.

1048
01:02:09,609 --> 01:02:10,669
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a joke from a party.

1049
01:02:11,189 --> 01:02:13,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's just funny after a conversation.

1050
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:18,833
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Irene got married at a party when this guy was drunk, so... Yeah, his name's William.

1051
01:02:19,273 --> 01:02:19,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1052
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:20,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And John.

1053
01:02:48,277 --> 01:02:49,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, my roommate, John.

1054
01:02:49,678 --> 01:02:53,721
[SPEAKER_15]: We were all in the car, and we were talking about going to Vegas and wanting to go to Vegas.

1055
01:02:54,202 --> 01:03:00,206
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were talking about wanting to talk about – because you know how everybody's – I think the topic of Britney Spears came up.

1056
01:03:00,226 --> 01:03:02,628
[SPEAKER_15]: But you know how everybody's always talking about, oh, the sanctity of marriage.

1057
01:03:02,648 --> 01:03:06,471
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we were talking about the sanctity of marriage, and we were bringing up examples of why there's no sanctity.

1058
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,853
[SPEAKER_15]: And those laws – and I don't mean to be political, but whatever.

1059
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:11,435
[SPEAKER_15]: The laws in those states pass.

1060
01:03:11,595 --> 01:03:15,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Marriage should only be a man and a woman to protect the sanctity of marriage.

1061
01:03:15,878 --> 01:03:19,039
[SPEAKER_15]: and then we talk about Britney Spears gets married in an old within 48 hours.

1062
01:03:19,219 --> 01:03:21,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Excellent example of the sanctity of marriage at work, right?

1063
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:26,062
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're talking about who would you go to Vegas and get married and then divorce right away?

1064
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:31,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Like we were talking, let's go to, since we can't, since like, you know, us being gay, we can't marry each other.

1065
01:03:31,264 --> 01:03:32,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Jamie's already married.

1066
01:03:32,184 --> 01:03:32,724
[SPEAKER_15]: She can't remarry.

1067
01:03:33,005 --> 01:03:33,885
[SPEAKER_15]: But the rest of us are all gay.

1068
01:03:33,925 --> 01:03:34,785
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't marry each other.

1069
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:35,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I can pretend.

1070
01:03:35,726 --> 01:03:40,067
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to marry women and go to Vegas and just get married to a woman and then divorce.

1071
01:03:40,227 --> 01:03:41,548
[SPEAKER_15]: So they were saying, who should I marry?

1072
01:03:41,868 --> 01:03:44,689
[SPEAKER_15]: And then your name came up, Irene, as to somebody I should marry.

1073
01:03:46,129 --> 01:03:47,369
[SPEAKER_15]: and I was like, no!

1074
01:03:47,849 --> 01:03:49,410
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even want to be married to her for an hour.

1075
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:52,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Why do you look so sad?

1076
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:54,331
[SPEAKER_15]: You can marry Eddie or something.

1077
01:03:54,451 --> 01:03:55,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I would marry Eddie.

1078
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:57,332
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get married when we're 30.

1079
01:03:58,012 --> 01:04:00,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Why did you look so shocked that I wouldn't marry you?

1080
01:04:00,093 --> 01:04:01,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you don't want to marry me.

1081
01:04:01,933 --> 01:04:03,474
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be a dysfunctional marriage.

1082
01:04:03,594 --> 01:04:05,674
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be really bad.

1083
01:04:06,035 --> 01:04:08,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody wants to marry me.

1084
01:04:08,535 --> 01:04:11,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the bright idea of having a group wedding and then a group annulment.

1085
01:04:12,276 --> 01:04:13,277
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great idea.

1086
01:04:13,337 --> 01:04:14,817
[SPEAKER_05]: We should do that right now.

1087
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:16,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget the show.

1088
01:04:16,513 --> 01:04:18,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, Irene's already married to somebody that you know, so.

1089
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:19,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, really?

1090
01:04:20,777 --> 01:04:21,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1091
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:23,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, did she marry my boyfriend when I wasn't with him?

1092
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:24,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, exactly.

1093
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:24,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job.

1094
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And he does crazy things to her all the time.

1095
01:04:26,582 --> 01:04:27,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you putting out?

1096
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:29,505
[SPEAKER_11]: According to him, she is.

1097
01:04:29,525 --> 01:04:31,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you see the pictures on my MySpace?

1098
01:04:31,727 --> 01:04:32,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1099
01:04:32,308 --> 01:04:33,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.

1100
01:04:33,049 --> 01:04:34,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's no pictures.

1101
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:35,110
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1102
01:04:35,491 --> 01:04:35,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

1103
01:04:36,676 --> 01:04:41,559
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really know what it... Maybe it's because I've been drinking a little bit here in studio tonight, but yeah, that had nothing to do with games.

1104
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:47,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Irene... Loki's sitting over there doing like the... Either the I've got to go to the bathroom dance or goddammit, can we talk about video games?

1105
01:04:47,462 --> 01:04:50,363
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Irene makes chocolate something that was on his shirt.

1106
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:56,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I like grapes.

1107
01:04:57,467 --> 01:04:59,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Eddie brings the show to a screeching halt.

1108
01:04:59,188 --> 01:05:01,729
[SPEAKER_15]: 10 gamers score.

1109
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:03,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways... I also like beer.

1110
01:05:05,506 --> 01:05:06,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Beer is great.

1111
01:05:06,847 --> 01:05:08,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Beer makes this show possible.

1112
01:05:27,498 --> 01:05:35,681
[SPEAKER_02]: This mystical new 40GB PlayStation 3 SKU, which we had no idea was going to come out, is now made official.

1113
01:05:36,121 --> 01:05:42,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, earlier this week there was rumors saying, oh, it's not going to be backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 games at all.

1114
01:05:43,323 --> 01:05:48,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people were like, oh, no, of course it will be because, you know, they do it all via software emulation and that kind of stuff.

1115
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:51,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, come to find out, guess what?

1116
01:05:51,668 --> 01:05:55,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't backwards compatible with any PlayStation 2 games.

1117
01:05:55,312 --> 01:06:02,781
[SPEAKER_02]: So they removed, essentially, a free part of the PlayStation 3 just to fuck you all over again.

1118
01:06:03,142 --> 01:06:03,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1119
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is official for Europe.

1120
01:06:05,926 --> 01:06:07,446
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be coming out here pretty soon.

1121
01:06:08,266 --> 01:06:11,367
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not backwards compatible with PlayStation 2 titles at all.

1122
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:14,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be coming out on October 10th for a price of €399.

1123
01:06:15,368 --> 01:06:21,870
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will only have two USB ports instead of four, which is not a huge deal.

1124
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:26,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And none of the multi-memory card ports, which is also not a real big deal.

1125
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:28,472
[SPEAKER_02]: But come on!

1126
01:06:28,952 --> 01:06:31,433
[SPEAKER_02]: No backwards compatibility PlayStation 2 games?

1127
01:06:31,453 --> 01:06:31,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

1128
01:06:32,984 --> 01:06:38,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sure that they'll be busy playing your entire library of games for the PlayStation 3.

1129
01:06:38,972 --> 01:06:41,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Why do you need PlayStation 2 games when you have Motorstorm and Lair?

1130
01:06:41,976 --> 01:06:43,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, my mistake.

1131
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:45,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, forgive me.

1132
01:06:45,661 --> 01:06:48,845
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not even backwards compatible with patches on the hard drive?

1133
01:06:49,746 --> 01:06:50,287
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.

1134
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:51,632
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1135
01:07:11,244 --> 01:07:14,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, why is it such a big deal when you have a PlayStation 2 right there on the shelf?

1136
01:07:14,266 --> 01:07:15,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you really need it to play PlayStation 2 games?

1137
01:07:16,447 --> 01:07:19,670
[SPEAKER_15]: I say yes, because A, I know people who don't own PlayStation 2s.

1138
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:20,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Imports.

1139
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:24,232
[SPEAKER_15]: And B, PlayStation 2s sometimes break a while later.

1140
01:07:25,253 --> 01:07:27,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, but you can't play PlayStation 2 imports.

1141
01:07:27,635 --> 01:07:28,275
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not region free.

1142
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:28,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen them.

1143
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:31,097
[SPEAKER_15]: On a Japanese PlayStation 3, you can.

1144
01:07:31,137 --> 01:07:31,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope.

1145
01:07:31,954 --> 01:07:34,155
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you cannot play... There's video proof out there, I'll tell you.

1146
01:07:34,255 --> 01:07:40,258
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot play Japanese games on PlayStation 2s or PlayStation 3s of other regions.

1147
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:43,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Only PlayStation 3 games are region-free.

1148
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the game might not have been coded.

1149
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:49,382
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just... It's really, really stupid.

1150
01:07:50,503 --> 01:07:55,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the hell they were thinking, but... Hey, if you want to, you know...

1151
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:57,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy one of these.

1152
01:07:57,591 --> 01:07:58,391
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be available.

1153
01:07:58,571 --> 01:08:00,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, save yourself some money, I guess.

1154
01:08:00,953 --> 01:08:03,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it's because they don't really want to cut the price on these.

1155
01:08:03,634 --> 01:08:08,237
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is their way of, I don't know, getting people to buy the more expensive... I don't know.

1156
01:08:08,257 --> 01:08:18,403
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing is they're like, well, we're offering these cheaper SKUs, but it's... Even starting with the 20GB PS3, it's like, well, we have this cheaper SKU, but it's kind of, you know, a little bit gimped.

1157
01:08:18,843 --> 01:08:22,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe just spend the extra $100 or whatever and buy the better one.

1158
01:08:23,226 --> 01:08:24,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of what they've been doing.

1159
01:08:24,386 --> 01:08:26,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we're throwing out this crap car.

1160
01:08:27,008 --> 01:08:35,835
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you can either choose this car with no wheels, no steering wheel, no airbags, and no gas tank, or you could buy this Ferrari.

1161
01:08:36,336 --> 01:08:37,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would you like?

1162
01:08:37,757 --> 01:08:43,822
[SPEAKER_15]: I love this comment in the chat room from Escapist at chat.orangelaunchradio.com says, Reactions to criticism.

1163
01:08:44,182 --> 01:08:45,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Nintendo gets angry.

1164
01:08:46,023 --> 01:08:48,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Microsoft is sorry and tries to fix the problem.

1165
01:08:48,866 --> 01:08:51,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Sony goes and pleasures itself in the corner while singing show tunes.

1166
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:54,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Clang, clang, clang goes the trolley

1167
01:09:06,937 --> 01:09:07,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

1168
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:21,026
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're really serious on getting the PlayStation 3, and you're waiting for Metal Gear Solid 4, Grand Theft Auto 4, Final Fantasy XIII, I suggest you purchase the console closer to the time when these games come out.

1169
01:09:21,406 --> 01:09:28,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Because by then, they're going to have about four other SKUs that will have varying degrees of crippled

1170
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:28,911
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

1171
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:53,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

1172
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:56,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get why you would remove something that's free.

1173
01:09:56,493 --> 01:09:57,553
[SPEAKER_02]: It boggles my mind.

1174
01:09:57,994 --> 01:09:58,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand.

1175
01:09:59,675 --> 01:10:01,976
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just a girl who can't say no.

1176
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:04,438
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in a terrible fix.

1177
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:07,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm singing in the rain.

1178
01:10:15,305 --> 01:10:19,007
[SPEAKER_15]: This is great radio you have.

1179
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:20,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad, is the camera on?

1180
01:10:21,015 --> 01:10:22,715
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the camera shut off after 40 minutes.

1181
01:10:24,356 --> 01:10:24,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

1182
01:10:26,277 --> 01:10:33,380
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I hear that there's going to be a new SKU or something coming out over here with Spider-Man 3 bundled with it, so hey, at least you have a fucking Blu-ray player.

1183
01:10:34,681 --> 01:10:35,121
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

1184
01:10:35,825 --> 01:10:40,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, obviously, needless to say, this news makes us a little bit agitated.

1185
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:42,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially for those of us that were hoping to clear the space on the shelves.

1186
01:10:42,652 --> 01:10:45,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Or maybe see some upscaled PlayStation 2.

1187
01:10:45,415 --> 01:10:46,916
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that would have been kind of cool too.

1188
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:48,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1189
01:10:48,318 --> 01:10:49,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to interrupt you real quick.

1190
01:10:49,939 --> 01:10:56,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to add Sony's official comment to explain why they decided not to put backwards compatibility in there.

1191
01:10:56,906 --> 01:10:57,226
[SPEAKER_02]: It says...

1192
01:10:58,718 --> 01:10:59,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

1193
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:13,941
[SPEAKER_02]: There is sufficient choice in the marketplace, and we're still better off using that money that we put into backwards compatibility, either investing in new games or using that money to help support bringing the price down.

1194
01:11:14,721 --> 01:11:23,702
[SPEAKER_02]: We have made it clear on many occasions that our priority is on developing innovative new features and services for the PlayStation 3, not on backwards compatibility.

1195
01:11:25,063 --> 01:11:26,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but...

1196
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:30,234
[SPEAKER_02]: They have it built into the firmware right now.

1197
01:11:31,215 --> 01:11:32,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Why remove it?

1198
01:11:32,776 --> 01:11:34,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's just being a dick.

1199
01:11:34,318 --> 01:11:34,999
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.

1200
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,602
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're a gent, you know you're a gent.

1201
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:49,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Needless to say...

1202
01:11:52,122 --> 01:11:55,164
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the show tunes hour on Orange Lounge Radio.

1203
01:11:55,464 --> 01:12:09,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to remind you guys that Phil Harrison, about a year ago, said, Backwards compatibility, as you know from PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2, is a core value of what we believe we should offer.

1204
01:12:10,032 --> 01:12:12,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And access to a library of content people have created...

1205
01:12:13,735 --> 01:12:19,058
[SPEAKER_02]: All the game developers copied their controller design, forgetting that they copied theirs from Super Nintendo, so, you know.

1206
01:12:19,078 --> 01:12:19,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1207
01:12:19,779 --> 01:12:20,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's continue.

1208
01:12:20,379 --> 01:12:20,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Sigh.

1209
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:47,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, actually, Sony actually released an official statement on the matter.

1210
01:12:58,796 --> 01:13:01,558
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that song?

1211
01:13:03,318 --> 01:13:07,400
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't stop PS3, you can't stop it, you can't, can't stop the PS3.

1212
01:13:10,581 --> 01:13:12,362
[SPEAKER_10]: They probably think they're winning right now.

1213
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:17,154
[SPEAKER_02]: We are winning!

1214
01:13:17,755 --> 01:13:19,257
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't buy a PS3 anywhere!

1215
01:13:22,281 --> 01:13:22,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry!

1216
01:13:23,122 --> 01:13:23,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but seriously.

1217
01:13:24,364 --> 01:13:26,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Every week it's a fucking story like this.

1218
01:13:26,106 --> 01:13:26,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

1219
01:13:27,705 --> 01:13:29,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Who the fuck is running their company?

1220
01:13:29,426 --> 01:13:32,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how do they make these decisions?

1221
01:13:32,388 --> 01:13:34,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, let's have a... Chimpanzees.

1222
01:13:34,189 --> 01:13:35,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who thinks up this shit?

1223
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:36,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God.

1224
01:13:36,531 --> 01:13:37,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I made the joke earlier this week.

1225
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:47,638
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some guy on their advertising or marketing strategies team or whatever that's trying to get fired and come up with the stupidest fucking ideas and wanting to get himself fired.

1226
01:13:47,878 --> 01:13:49,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, hey, that's a great idea.

1227
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:49,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's run with that.

1228
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, my God.

1229
01:13:52,902 --> 01:13:53,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who...

1230
01:13:53,803 --> 01:13:54,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Who thinks this is crazy?

1231
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:55,604
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1232
01:13:55,844 --> 01:14:02,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what they do is that they have those magnets, you know, that you make your own poetry out of on their phone.

1233
01:14:03,289 --> 01:14:08,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they just, they reach in and grab like six of them and put them in order and that's their new marketing plan.

1234
01:14:10,773 --> 01:14:13,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not people that are picking them out, they're trained monkeys.

1235
01:14:14,756 --> 01:14:16,217
[SPEAKER_04]: They're poorly trained monkeys.

1236
01:14:17,698 --> 01:14:20,560
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes they have to wipe the poo off of them that they fling as they make it.

1237
01:14:32,637 --> 01:14:49,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Kutaragi, here I go again My, my, crayons are delicious Kutaragi, here we go again No backwards compatibility on PS3 Hey, I need work So how many beers did you have, Rob?

1238
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:51,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one, amazingly

1239
01:14:55,265 --> 01:15:05,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Now's a good time for the FUs of the Week, as our chat room is just, all I'm seeing in chat room is like dot, dot, dot, just right on down the screen.

1240
01:15:06,233 --> 01:15:07,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get into the FUs of the Week.

1241
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:10,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Ladies and gentlemen, we have some brand new old FU music.

1242
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:13,818
[SPEAKER_15]: We're bringing back an old FU tonight, and let's kick it off.

1243
01:15:13,838 --> 01:15:20,383
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the part of the show where we get angsty, and obviously this news about the removed backwards compatibility, which seems to be a step backwards, makes us a little angry.

1244
01:15:20,403 --> 01:15:23,005
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you disagree, send us an email, mailbag at orangehauntrader.com.

1245
01:15:23,045 --> 01:15:23,785
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't read it.

1246
01:15:23,965 --> 01:15:24,766
[SPEAKER_15]: The FUs of the Week.

1247
01:15:40,819 --> 01:15:43,680
[SPEAKER_04]: So, my FU of the week goes toward bitches.

1248
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:48,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid, petty bitches.

1249
01:15:48,182 --> 01:15:50,643
[SPEAKER_15]: But Jamie, then you're screwing yourself.

1250
01:15:50,663 --> 01:15:51,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1251
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:52,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1252
01:15:53,825 --> 01:15:55,065
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what happened at work.

1253
01:15:55,145 --> 01:15:59,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, people know that I like to leave detailed diagrams on how people should park in a parking lot.

1254
01:15:59,907 --> 01:16:00,928
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't do that this time.

1255
01:16:01,528 --> 01:16:08,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I was pulling into one of the last parking spots at work, and there was this car that was double parked, and I nearly ran into their driver's side rearview mirror.

1256
01:16:09,466 --> 01:16:14,729
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I back out, park properly in the spot, and leave them a note that says, Please do not double park.

1257
01:16:15,749 --> 01:16:16,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I even said please.

1258
01:16:16,630 --> 01:16:18,510
[SPEAKER_04]: It was either that or call security and get them a ticket.

1259
01:16:19,251 --> 01:16:22,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they get ticketed enough, then they have to park outside the parking lot.

1260
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:24,333
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a gate in the parking lot.

1261
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:36,579
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I go back in, and I go out, and these girls are standing around my car, kneeling down by my tires, and I can hear these loud, echoing voices, and hear tire, and note, and this, and then my mother calls me.

1262
01:16:36,599 --> 01:16:38,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, crap, mom.

1263
01:16:38,442 --> 01:16:41,324
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm talking to my mom, standing by the back door, watching them do shit to my car.

1264
01:16:41,524 --> 01:16:42,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what they're doing.

1265
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:46,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they get in their car and drive past, and then I hear, Oh, there she is!

1266
01:16:46,488 --> 01:16:46,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that.

1267
01:16:47,589 --> 01:16:49,230
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm on the phone with my mother.

1268
01:16:49,711 --> 01:16:53,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't want to get into a fight with loud people when you're on the phone with your mother.

1269
01:16:54,274 --> 01:16:56,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Although my mom would probably be very proud of me.

1270
01:16:56,936 --> 01:16:58,217
[SPEAKER_15]: Not really.

1271
01:16:58,257 --> 01:16:59,178
[SPEAKER_15]: Question from chat real quick.

1272
01:16:59,258 --> 01:17:03,301
[SPEAKER_15]: SSJ100Matt asks, Where was youparklikeanasshole.com in this moment?

1273
01:17:04,002 --> 01:17:05,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have any of the stickers on me.

1274
01:17:06,192 --> 01:17:11,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go back inside, wait five minutes, go back out after I'm off to film my mom, and they're gone.

1275
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:14,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go back to my car, and I go about my business, everything seems fine.

1276
01:17:14,876 --> 01:17:22,440
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have a magnet on my car that's a little rainbow heart, and I thought that they stole it, but it turned out that my husband took it off when he was driving my car when he was fixing it.

1277
01:17:23,081 --> 01:17:29,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get back, and my tires have been low for a couple weeks, so I said, you know, I'm getting gas today, I'll go ahead and fill my tires.

1278
01:17:30,608 --> 01:17:36,653
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried to get the caps off on the passenger side, and the caps wouldn't come off on my valve stems on my tires.

1279
01:17:37,473 --> 01:17:38,715
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other side was just fine.

1280
01:17:39,095 --> 01:17:49,344
[SPEAKER_04]: So I ended up going to Bridgestone the next day, and they had these two wrenches to get the caps off, and it turned out that they put nail glue, like super glue, in the caps on my tires.

1281
01:17:49,924 --> 01:17:50,465
[SPEAKER_04]: So now...

1282
01:17:51,902 --> 01:17:58,763
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I think it would have been much better for them to be a little peeved about a little note than be fired for vandalism and harassment.

1283
01:18:00,484 --> 01:18:02,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's what's going to happen to them.

1284
01:18:02,324 --> 01:18:10,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the exact time of day that they drove out of the parking lot, and we have cameras that record all license plates as they go in and out.

1285
01:18:10,825 --> 01:18:15,426
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're hired by the place, when you get your new badge, you are required to give your license plate number to security.

1286
01:18:15,866 --> 01:18:20,267
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be very fired, all four of them, and I am going to laugh my ass off.

1287
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, I didn't know we had applause.

1288
01:18:26,891 --> 01:18:29,092
[SPEAKER_15]: There's an applause light in here, apparently.

1289
01:18:29,172 --> 01:18:29,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, moving on.

1290
01:18:30,332 --> 01:18:32,553
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, because see, this is what I mean.

1291
01:18:32,593 --> 01:18:33,473
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't fuck with me.

1292
01:18:34,733 --> 01:18:36,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, follow that.

1293
01:18:37,294 --> 01:18:37,494
[SPEAKER_02]: F.E.

1294
01:18:37,514 --> 01:18:40,575
[SPEAKER_02]: McDonald's for not knowing how to fucking cook french fries.

1295
01:18:40,995 --> 01:18:43,556
[SPEAKER_02]: You just put them in the fucking fryer and push a button.

1296
01:18:43,916 --> 01:18:44,697
[SPEAKER_02]: How hard is that?

1297
01:18:44,757 --> 01:18:49,038
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet you fucking find a way to screw it up every single time.

1298
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:53,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, fries should taste the same every single time.

1299
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:54,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time.

1300
01:18:54,739 --> 01:18:57,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a button that you push.

1301
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:00,281
[SPEAKER_02]: How the fuck do you fuck up a button?

1302
01:19:00,641 --> 01:19:01,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really?

1303
01:19:03,622 --> 01:19:04,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck that.

1304
01:19:04,482 --> 01:19:05,462
[SPEAKER_15]: My FU of the week.

1305
01:19:06,022 --> 01:19:07,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's a pot.

1306
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Showing signs of support tonight.

1307
01:19:10,504 --> 01:19:13,725
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to keep my FU brief tonight because the others were a little long.

1308
01:19:13,965 --> 01:19:14,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that that's a problem.

1309
01:19:14,785 --> 01:19:15,585
[SPEAKER_15]: My FU is brief tonight.

1310
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:17,926
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to give an FU to show tunes.

1311
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:18,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Enough said.

1312
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Papi, you're up next.

1313
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:29,632
[SPEAKER_14]: I give an F you to the California DMV for being slow as fuck, even online.

1314
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:33,894
[SPEAKER_14]: I paid my registration for my car two and a half weeks ago.

1315
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:35,915
[SPEAKER_14]: They still have not sent me my new tax.

1316
01:19:37,615 --> 01:19:38,456
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's pissing me off.

1317
01:19:38,516 --> 01:19:40,076
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm waiting to get pulled over for it.

1318
01:19:40,837 --> 01:19:41,717
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's going to suck.

1319
01:19:41,737 --> 01:19:45,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold your... Hold... Okay, now you can applaud.

1320
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:46,219
Yay!

1321
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:50,710
[SPEAKER_11]: How can you recant something that you never said in the first game?

1322
01:20:13,646 --> 01:20:14,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I did.

1323
01:20:14,487 --> 01:20:15,648
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple weeks ago.

1324
01:20:16,688 --> 01:20:17,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Rice Princess, your turn.

1325
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:20,691
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to recanting stuff that you never said in the first place.

1326
01:20:21,192 --> 01:20:21,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1327
01:20:22,353 --> 01:20:24,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sort of trying to clap.

1328
01:20:28,037 --> 01:20:28,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Back to the show.

1329
01:20:31,339 --> 01:20:35,562
[SPEAKER_15]: From angst and F yous to Harvest Moon!

1330
01:20:35,582 --> 01:20:35,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay!

1331
01:20:37,604 --> 01:20:42,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Harvest Moon, if you are a fan of farming, and actually I know there's some fans of Harvest Moon because I...

1332
01:20:43,849 --> 01:20:45,730
[SPEAKER_15]: I dared to make fun of Harvest Moon.

1333
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:51,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what else do you do on Harvest Moon?

1334
01:20:52,412 --> 01:20:55,233
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we have some fans of Harvest Moon because I got yelled at by one one week in an email.

1335
01:20:55,553 --> 01:20:57,074
[SPEAKER_15]: You're a fan of Harvest Moon, right?

1336
01:20:57,094 --> 01:20:57,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well then good.

1337
01:20:57,734 --> 01:20:58,434
[SPEAKER_15]: This ought to be good news.

1338
01:20:58,994 --> 01:21:04,496
[SPEAKER_15]: The Harvest Moon creator, Yashuro Wada, has announced that the next Harvest Moon game is going to be online.

1339
01:21:05,357 --> 01:21:09,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Meaning that between two and eight players can actually visit a town.

1340
01:21:09,478 --> 01:21:12,019
[SPEAKER_15]: The only trick, we don't know what platform the game's on yet.

1341
01:21:12,791 --> 01:21:15,112
[SPEAKER_15]: But the next Harvest Moon game will be online.

1342
01:21:17,393 --> 01:21:18,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And it won't be Nintendo.

1343
01:21:19,013 --> 01:21:19,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, not necessarily.

1344
01:21:19,973 --> 01:21:20,654
[SPEAKER_15]: It could be DS.

1345
01:21:20,754 --> 01:21:22,374
[SPEAKER_15]: That could be a very DS thing.

1346
01:21:23,635 --> 01:21:24,395
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do?

1347
01:21:24,435 --> 01:21:25,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Have competitive cow milking?

1348
01:21:26,055 --> 01:21:28,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop releasing so many damn Harvest Moon games.

1349
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:31,557
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been like four this year already, and there's still more coming.

1350
01:21:31,617 --> 01:21:32,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I'm serious.

1351
01:21:32,377 --> 01:21:33,178
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do?

1352
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:34,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Have competing farms or some shit?

1353
01:21:35,038 --> 01:21:36,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Or go visit other people's cows?

1354
01:21:37,819 --> 01:21:39,339
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell did you do in Animal Crossing?

1355
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:43,100
[SPEAKER_15]: You ran to towns and hit people with bug nets, and it was funny.

1356
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Or buried things in holes.

1357
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And you sent dirty letters to their townsfolk.

1358
01:21:46,781 --> 01:21:49,481
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right, and you buried pitfalls in front of people's houses.

1359
01:21:49,641 --> 01:21:52,022
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'll tell you what you do in Animal Crossing.

1360
01:21:52,442 --> 01:21:57,903
[SPEAKER_05]: You play the game with your best friend, only to have him backstab you and get the trophy first.

1361
01:21:59,283 --> 01:22:01,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you forget, Rob, so easily?

1362
01:22:02,744 --> 01:22:04,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, actually, I did forget.

1363
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:04,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody's got some...

1364
01:22:05,739 --> 01:22:06,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you know what?

1365
01:22:07,220 --> 01:22:07,640
[SPEAKER_05]: It hurt.

1366
01:22:10,562 --> 01:22:13,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, you're seriously mad that I went and got the gold villager?

1367
01:22:13,363 --> 01:22:14,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I was mad for like two minutes.

1368
01:22:14,644 --> 01:22:16,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, stupid motherfucker.

1369
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:17,665
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a little longer than two minutes.

1370
01:22:17,685 --> 01:22:18,986
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been like two and a half years.

1371
01:22:19,046 --> 01:22:19,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

1372
01:22:19,846 --> 01:22:21,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought about it again, okay?

1373
01:22:22,107 --> 01:22:23,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez, work with me on this.

1374
01:22:25,549 --> 01:22:25,989
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1375
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:29,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I want factory moon.

1376
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of having a cow on a farm.

1377
01:22:31,292 --> 01:22:32,172
[SPEAKER_15]: You have a cow factory?

1378
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,362
[SPEAKER_04]: You have like a, you know, Cowschwitz.

1379
01:22:35,923 --> 01:22:40,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I was going to say, all they need to do is put a slaughterhouse in Harvest Moon and the game will be like ten times cooler.

1380
01:22:41,627 --> 01:22:44,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they do have... PETA will protest.

1381
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:50,954
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have Innocent Life, a futuristic Harvest Moon, which takes farming to the future.

1382
01:22:51,595 --> 01:22:52,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?

1383
01:22:52,395 --> 01:22:57,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the same as farming now, except it's in the future.

1384
01:22:59,901 --> 01:23:00,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Hurrah.

1385
01:23:02,586 --> 01:23:04,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go on to the next story.

1386
01:23:04,147 --> 01:23:06,069
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think there's anything more we can say on Harvest Moon.

1387
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:08,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Except that it's Harvest Moon.

1388
01:23:09,412 --> 01:23:19,581
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is actually pretty... And I love stuff like this, where they do studies about how video games improve your intelligence and your skills and shit.

1389
01:23:20,742 --> 01:23:23,845
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying now that action games improve women's spatial abilities.

1390
01:23:25,947 --> 01:23:26,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1391
01:23:28,049 --> 01:23:29,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they didn't have any to begin with?

1392
01:23:30,971 --> 01:23:32,532
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm asking a hypothetical question.

1393
01:23:33,253 --> 01:23:38,797
[SPEAKER_04]: It says that it helps improve skills like geometry, technical drawings, reading maps.

1394
01:23:40,038 --> 01:23:45,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that has to do with space and how... Not that a woman would ever admit to doing that.

1395
01:23:45,282 --> 01:23:51,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you need geometry for shopping anyway?

1396
01:23:51,728 --> 01:23:52,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Geometry?

1397
01:23:52,248 --> 01:23:53,029
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that?

1398
01:23:53,149 --> 01:23:53,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Geometry?

1399
01:23:53,989 --> 01:23:54,490
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1400
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:56,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

1401
01:23:58,373 --> 01:23:59,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, take this back.

1402
01:23:59,233 --> 01:24:09,897
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's more or less the cognitive function of how things fit, how things are laid out, space, judging distances, that type of thing.

1403
01:24:12,258 --> 01:24:20,220
[SPEAKER_04]: But I look at it this way, that anything that you do that makes you use that skill should improve it.

1404
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:25,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, a video game could help with that, but so could actually...

1405
01:24:26,306 --> 01:24:33,548
[SPEAKER_04]: practicing topography or, you know, spending time drawing or... Raising cows.

1406
01:24:34,168 --> 01:24:35,148
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not raising cows.

1407
01:24:35,748 --> 01:24:40,809
[SPEAKER_02]: So which one of those abilities focuses on using the turn signal when switching lanes?

1408
01:24:41,609 --> 01:24:42,110
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1409
01:24:42,230 --> 01:24:44,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I have actually run across more male drivers.

1410
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:47,091
[SPEAKER_15]: I was trying very hard to refrain from the driving joke.

1411
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:48,351
[SPEAKER_15]: You should be very proud of me.

1412
01:24:48,471 --> 01:24:52,012
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very hard not to say, but will it make them better drivers?

1413
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:52,792
[SPEAKER_15]: I was doing very...

1414
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:54,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1415
01:24:54,109 --> 01:24:54,590
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1416
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Gender has absolutely nothing to do with bad driving.

1417
01:24:56,892 --> 01:25:00,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It's overall intelligence, and I've run across more male drivers who are worse drivers than women.

1418
01:25:00,915 --> 01:25:03,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, then this begs the point, why just women?

1419
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:05,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Why doesn't it give men better spatial abilities?

1420
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:09,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think that they've just did the study on women.

1421
01:25:09,662 --> 01:25:11,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we're uber awesome?

1422
01:25:11,603 --> 01:25:11,944
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1423
01:25:13,285 --> 01:25:18,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know that the majority of people in this room are male, but I'm sorry, testosterone makes you stupid.

1424
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:21,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, snap.

1425
01:25:22,865 --> 01:25:23,966
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.

1426
01:25:24,006 --> 01:25:25,067
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Rob's party.

1427
01:25:25,527 --> 01:25:28,509
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you talking about testosterone?

1428
01:25:28,729 --> 01:25:36,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean it like that, but I think that having a higher tendency toward aggression usually leads to less common sense.

1429
01:25:36,194 --> 01:25:40,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Now JV Mon in chat room gives a comment that makes it all make sense.

1430
01:25:40,737 --> 01:25:43,999
[SPEAKER_15]: JV Mon says men get better spatial ability from masturbating.

1431
01:25:44,259 --> 01:25:46,941
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know how much clearance you need?

1432
01:25:49,662 --> 01:25:49,982
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1433
01:25:50,122 --> 01:26:04,728
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I don't really think that men have, I don't really think, after living in a house and having my husband and all of his friends over, I don't think that, from that sample, I don't think that all men have good spatial ability or else they wouldn't pee on the seat.

1434
01:26:08,069 --> 01:26:11,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And would learn how to close the seat when they're done.

1435
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:13,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know what?

1436
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:15,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things are skill, some things are luck, okay?

1437
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:19,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Sinkstar R&B has been announced.

1438
01:26:44,087 --> 01:26:47,989
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn, there hasn't been enough SingStar games this year yet.

1439
01:26:49,409 --> 01:26:55,651
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently a wonderful track list is coming out as well, including all sorts of fun stuff.

1440
01:26:55,991 --> 01:27:05,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Eyed Peas, Pump It, Destiny's Child, Bootylicious, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the French Prince, Summertime.

1441
01:27:05,855 --> 01:27:06,555
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome.

1442
01:27:08,075 --> 01:27:12,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Gwen Stefani, Hollaback Girl, and let's see here.

1443
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:27,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Luther Vandross, Never Too Much, Outcast, Idlewild Blue, Don't You Worry About Me, and Whitney Houston, Your Love Is My Love, among others.

1444
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:36,128
[SPEAKER_15]: And I knew it would take merely seconds for someone to make this comment, but Hippolytus in our chatroom says, Black Eyed Peas is not R&B.

1445
01:27:36,148 --> 01:27:39,709
[SPEAKER_15]: That would take five seconds for someone to say that.

1446
01:27:40,229 --> 01:27:42,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't tell my mother about this game, because she loves Luther.

1447
01:27:42,737 --> 01:27:43,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Andros.

1448
01:27:43,117 --> 01:27:43,798
[SPEAKER_15]: She really does.

1449
01:27:44,478 --> 01:27:47,881
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you know my mother, she's... I think she likes both.

1450
01:27:47,901 --> 01:27:52,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, neither... I don't think Hall of Batgirls R&B either, but, you know, whatever.

1451
01:27:53,705 --> 01:27:54,505
[SPEAKER_15]: That's true, too.

1452
01:27:54,525 --> 01:27:55,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't know.

1453
01:27:55,046 --> 01:27:55,386
[SPEAKER_15]: A little bit.

1454
01:27:56,727 --> 01:27:56,967
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1455
01:27:57,007 --> 01:28:04,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, let's go on to a brand new segment, which is going to be our last segment of Part A tonight.

1456
01:28:05,177 --> 01:28:06,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Dark Sakura's Classic Game of the Week

1457
01:28:23,724 --> 01:28:24,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the same old music.

1458
01:28:25,485 --> 01:28:28,807
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, because the chat room was really like the old music.

1459
01:28:28,847 --> 01:28:30,888
[SPEAKER_15]: It didn't want to see it go away, so we had to keep it.

1460
01:28:30,948 --> 01:28:33,670
[SPEAKER_15]: So, DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1461
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:39,553
[SPEAKER_04]: The classic game of the week is Fantasy Zone, which is my second favorite video game ever.

1462
01:28:41,154 --> 01:28:44,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy Zone is a game where you play as a little ship called the Opa Opa.

1463
01:28:45,897 --> 01:28:48,498
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this little red ship with a window on it.

1464
01:28:48,518 --> 01:28:51,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It has wings, but when it's on the ground, it walks.

1465
01:28:52,621 --> 01:28:52,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1466
01:28:53,522 --> 01:28:54,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to the music.

1467
01:28:54,083 --> 01:28:55,324
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the best music ever.

1468
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:02,471
[SPEAKER_04]: It plays a lot like Defender.

1469
01:29:04,253 --> 01:29:04,673
[SPEAKER_15]: It is.

1470
01:29:04,813 --> 01:29:06,375
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Chibi Defender, basically.

1471
01:29:06,735 --> 01:29:07,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, you can keep reading.

1472
01:29:07,616 --> 01:29:08,777
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll let this play in the background.

1473
01:29:18,672 --> 01:29:19,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times.

1474
01:29:19,313 --> 01:29:20,333
[SPEAKER_15]: I like how the ship has feet.

1475
01:29:41,318 --> 01:29:44,199
[SPEAKER_04]: There was, and I actually have the other versions.

1476
01:29:44,259 --> 01:29:47,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Fantasy Zone on Master System and Super Nintendo.

1477
01:29:47,699 --> 01:29:48,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy Zone 2 on both.

1478
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, now Space Fantasy Zone was one that came out.

1479
01:29:53,381 --> 01:29:55,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was a prototype only.

1480
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:57,741
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to be out on the TurboGrafx Duo.

1481
01:29:58,502 --> 01:30:01,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a burn of it, but I haven't actually sat down and played it yet.

1482
01:30:01,962 --> 01:30:05,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was the Super Fantasy Zone.

1483
01:30:07,024 --> 01:30:20,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, for anyone who's a fan of import and cast games, some of the enemies from Fantasy Zone 2 were in the final boss for the game, Segagaga.

1484
01:30:21,534 --> 01:30:29,099
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a fun little game, and also the Fantasy Zone is the same universe that Space Harrier was set in.

1485
01:30:29,799 --> 01:30:35,243
[SPEAKER_04]: And you actually have a later level in Fantasy Zone that's the Space Harrier level.

1486
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:42,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, currently our little ship, the Opa Opa, is fighting a big tree that's spitting leaves.

1487
01:30:43,278 --> 01:30:43,838
[SPEAKER_15]: A tree trunk.

1488
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:44,679
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's cute.

1489
01:30:44,779 --> 01:30:45,179
[SPEAKER_15]: It's cute.

1490
01:30:45,299 --> 01:30:45,579
[SPEAKER_15]: It's okay.

1491
01:30:45,599 --> 01:30:49,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in the Space Harrier level, you actually fight low-eye heads.

1492
01:30:51,222 --> 01:31:04,728
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um... Also, another thing, for anyone who was collecting the Sega Ages 2900 collection, they redid the whole thing in 3D, but it was still side-scrolling.

1493
01:31:05,148 --> 01:31:06,469
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you did your, um...

1494
01:31:07,469 --> 01:31:12,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Your bonus level where you have to go catch all these coins, it was in first person.

1495
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:14,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Rob, you played my copy.

1496
01:31:15,212 --> 01:31:16,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it was kind of neat.

1497
01:31:16,933 --> 01:31:23,396
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was probably one of the best Sega games ever, I think.

1498
01:31:25,016 --> 01:31:25,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1499
01:31:26,957 --> 01:31:29,058
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can also go in shops and buy, like, anvils.

1500
01:31:30,353 --> 01:31:31,834
[SPEAKER_15]: and Wings and Fairy Wings for your ship.

1501
01:31:31,854 --> 01:31:34,935
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can buy Wings and you can buy extra boosters and different types of rockets.

1502
01:31:35,955 --> 01:31:42,017
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just like you buy this big thing that's like the one ton thing that they drop in the Looney Tunes cartoons and just drop it on ships.

1503
01:31:42,077 --> 01:31:42,557
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

1504
01:31:43,837 --> 01:31:44,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times.

1505
01:31:44,818 --> 01:31:45,058
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1506
01:31:45,078 --> 01:31:47,439
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Fantasy Zone is the classic game of the week.

1507
01:31:48,039 --> 01:31:51,100
[SPEAKER_15]: So check it out at your local swap meet.

1508
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:55,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Or, you know, there's other ways you can go about finding a ROM of Fantasy Zone.

1509
01:31:55,721 --> 01:31:56,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Two dollars on eBay.

1510
01:31:57,322 --> 01:31:57,562
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1511
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:01,597
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, well, that's going to bring to a close Part A of our podcast.

1512
01:32:01,657 --> 01:32:13,521
[SPEAKER_15]: But fear not, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, like it or not, in Part B. And coming up tonight in Part B, since it is Episode 250, we have to do one of our very favorite segments, Match Game, coming up tonight.

1513
01:32:13,801 --> 01:32:14,822
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

1514
01:32:14,842 --> 01:32:15,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Applause.

1515
01:32:15,882 --> 01:32:17,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Our new applause light is flashing, apparently.

1516
01:32:17,843 --> 01:32:17,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Woo!

1517
01:32:18,343 --> 01:32:20,505
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so the match game will be up in just a little bit.

1518
01:32:20,525 --> 01:32:22,787
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1519
01:32:22,967 --> 01:32:25,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Which, by the way, oh, I need to say one more thing about the show.

1520
01:32:25,749 --> 01:32:32,655
[SPEAKER_15]: The show is now going to be released on, due to popular demand, instead of making it wait until Wednesday, you now get Part B on Tuesday on the feed.

1521
01:32:32,735 --> 01:32:34,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you were saying we were going to release it on Betamax.

1522
01:32:35,498 --> 01:32:36,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we could, actually.

1523
01:32:36,839 --> 01:32:37,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that would be cool.

1524
01:32:37,759 --> 01:32:39,461
[SPEAKER_15]: We could actually find a working beta machine.

1525
01:32:39,481 --> 01:32:41,062
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have to go to the TV station to find that.

1526
01:32:42,643 --> 01:32:44,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be released on Laserdisc and Betamax.

1527
01:32:45,345 --> 01:32:50,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, and hopefully we will try very hard to keep Part B show tunes free.

1528
01:32:52,269 --> 01:32:54,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, we'll see, maybe.

1529
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:56,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, we'll be back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1530
01:32:57,492 --> 01:33:02,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1531
01:33:02,935 --> 01:33:07,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
