Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.960 --> 00:24.520
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, August the 26th of 2007, where

00:24.520 --> 00:28.620
we're taping Orange Lounge Radio live and this is the second half of our show, part

00:28.620 --> 00:29.620
B.

00:29.620 --> 00:32.760
We'll be right back into some gaming news from the one and only, Loki.

00:32.760 --> 00:33.760
Yes.

00:33.760 --> 00:39.120
Well, Metroid Prime 3 is coming out this week and one interesting thing on it is that they're

00:39.120 --> 00:44.200
going to have kind of like a in-game sort of like achievements.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.800
They're going to have like a token feature that you unlock different things as you're

00:47.800 --> 00:49.280
playing the game.

00:49.280 --> 00:52.800
And I don't know, I've seen this done in games before.

00:52.800 --> 00:57.000
It's not a huge deal, I mean it's not like achievements are coming to the Wii or anything

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
like that.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.240
In fact, they did something similar with Resistance where it had its kind of own achievement system

01:03.240 --> 01:08.440
and I think there was even something like that sort of on Excite Truck a little bit

01:08.440 --> 01:09.440
as well.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.920
So, I don't know, it's kind of neat.

01:11.920 --> 01:16.840
Apparently the tokens that you can earn in the game are in four different tiers, red,

01:16.840 --> 01:18.920
blue, green, and gold.

01:18.920 --> 01:24.720
Red tokens are gained by scanning enemies and items, blue for scanning lore and completing

01:24.720 --> 01:26.120
side quests.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.760
Green ones you get from friends.

01:29.760 --> 01:34.160
And gold is achieved from defeating bosses on various difficulties.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.720
What is different from this and like the trophies that you earn in Burnout?

01:37.720 --> 01:39.320
I think nothing.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.320
Nothing?

01:40.320 --> 01:41.520
Absolutely nothing.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.920
So what is so noteworthy about this?

01:43.920 --> 01:44.920
I think people...

01:44.920 --> 01:45.920
Is it the fact that it's the first time in a Metroid game?

01:45.920 --> 01:46.920
I guess.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.120
People are thinking, oh my god, achievements are coming.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.120
No.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.120
No.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.520
Alright, well one other thing that people would like to see coming to the Wii any day

01:55.520 --> 02:03.560
now is online play and also demos for the Wii and there's actually a new survey that's

02:03.560 --> 02:09.320
gone out from Nintendo that seems to indicate a little bit that there could be some actual

02:09.320 --> 02:12.440
Wii demos coming out in the near future.

02:12.440 --> 02:18.360
Nintendo actually submitted out this survey and on it are some different types of questions

02:18.360 --> 02:21.240
on it and they seem to point towards the...

02:21.240 --> 02:26.280
All signs, you could say, point to the fact that they're at least exploring the possibility

02:26.280 --> 02:28.120
of doing downloadable demos.

02:28.120 --> 02:35.320
Of course to date all we've really seen come from them would be the Metroid Prime 3 preview

02:35.320 --> 02:36.640
channel.

02:36.640 --> 02:40.360
Some of the things here, please indicate your level of interest in playable demo versions

02:40.360 --> 02:41.460
of Wii games.

02:41.460 --> 02:45.020
What is your preferred method of receiving Wii game demos?

02:45.020 --> 02:48.480
Would you be willing to pay more for your subscription in order to receive Wii game

02:48.480 --> 02:49.480
demos?

02:49.480 --> 02:51.360
Kind of interesting there.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.920
It would be kind of cool if Nintendo Power did have Wii game demos.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.660
But what the other big three consoles do for their magazines.

02:58.660 --> 03:05.000
But I would like to see the Wii actually able to download things other than virtual console

03:05.000 --> 03:07.820
titles and a few crappy titles.

03:07.820 --> 03:11.200
They're supposed to have original software, at least we know about that Mission Impossible

03:11.200 --> 03:12.200
thing, right?

03:12.200 --> 03:15.000
Well yeah, they're supposed to go online someday too.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.700
Come on, the console's been out for almost a year now.

03:17.700 --> 03:21.400
Time to start following through with that shit you've been promising us for a while

03:21.400 --> 03:22.400
now.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.400
Alright.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.720
Or we're going to have to start calling you Sony.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.200
Ooh, burn.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.200
Wow.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.400
Well, how about some happy Nintendo news?

03:31.400 --> 03:32.960
How does that sound?

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
Sounds good to me.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.980
Well, guess what is back for Super Mario Galaxy?

03:36.980 --> 03:38.960
We have fire flowers!

03:38.960 --> 03:40.960
And superstars!

03:40.960 --> 03:45.020
I love the fire flowers so much because they're like burning things.

03:45.020 --> 03:47.800
We're just happy that Mario can set fire to things again.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.480
Well, you know, the fire flower was such a great weapon and then we just didn't get it.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.000
We had him squirt shit with water.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Boo.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.840
What is so wrong with Mario Sunshine?

03:58.840 --> 04:00.160
It wasn't that bad of a game.

04:00.160 --> 04:01.160
Jesus.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.160
I loved Mario Sunshine.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.160
What?

04:03.160 --> 04:04.160
It is not the worst game ever.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.760
But I could not play that game and drink anything.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.540
It's the worst Mario game by far, it is so freaking terrible.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.960
We need, we need another game that's just like Mario 64.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.560
Did you play like Mario is Missing?

04:14.560 --> 04:21.200
Mario is Missing is a great game, I have all those MP3s.

04:21.200 --> 04:25.280
I liked it on Nintendo because they totally recreated the Super Nintendo graphics on the

04:25.280 --> 04:26.280
Nintendo.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.720
Going to chat room for some comments at chat.orangelandrater.com.

04:28.720 --> 04:33.800
RossdielUT says, Loki, stop wishing and relying on Nintendo's word.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.400
Shadow Charlie says, Tanooki suit.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.400
That would be a great thing to come back with.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
No, no, no.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.400
Hammer Brother suit.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.400
That would be pretty rad.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.400
Or the Kuriboh's boot.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.000
Yes, Kuriboh's shoe.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
That's awesome.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, that was it.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.800
But in other news, we do have a release date for the UK on this.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.680
It will be November 16th.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.320
Oh right.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.000
Not soon enough, right?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Not soon enough.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Alrighty.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Anyways.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.720
I do want to know who this new hoochie in the game is though, sorry.

05:05.720 --> 05:10.880
Anyways, interesting news, and we knew this was kind of coming, but finally the Wii has

05:10.880 --> 05:15.080
passed the Xbox 360 in worldwide sales.

05:15.080 --> 05:20.560
Now the last screenshot that we've seen of this was of course a few days ago with the

05:20.560 --> 05:29.720
Wii having approximately 10.57 million units worldwide and the Xbox 360 having 10.51 million

05:29.720 --> 05:30.720
units.

05:30.720 --> 05:37.080
Of course the PS3 still trailing behind with 4.32 million units.

05:37.080 --> 05:44.060
It should be known though that still the 360 is outselling the Wii in the US, but apparently

05:44.060 --> 05:49.680
Japan is where they're making up for a lot of slack.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.260
So what does this mean for Nintendo fanboys?

05:53.260 --> 05:57.020
Is this something additional for them to brag about or is this really not the big deal it

05:57.020 --> 05:58.280
seems like?

05:58.280 --> 06:05.720
I guess it's fuel for flame fodder I guess because the Wii has basically caught up to

06:05.720 --> 06:09.680
the 360 in half the time.

06:09.680 --> 06:15.780
So I don't know, I mean that's really good and I think if they could produce more units

06:15.780 --> 06:20.320
it would be even higher, but hopefully that means more support.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.320
Better games!

06:21.320 --> 06:25.520
Alright well some other bad news for the Xbox 360.

06:25.520 --> 06:28.980
Mass Effect is a title that a lot of people have been looking forward to and Mass Effect

06:28.980 --> 06:32.600
has been delayed to December 7th of this year.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.840
Now it wasn't a huge push from where it was originally scheduled, but you know people

06:36.840 --> 06:40.820
are chomping at the bit to get their hands on this game and so any delay I'm sure is

06:40.820 --> 06:42.240
bad news for its fans.

06:42.240 --> 06:46.280
Plus that means it's not going to be on shelves for the day after Thanksgiving madness so

06:46.280 --> 06:50.120
that's kind of too bad, but I'm sure those people that have been very good boys and girls

06:50.120 --> 06:55.760
this year that put this on their Christmas list, I'm sure Santa will find a way, right?

06:55.760 --> 06:56.760
Sure.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.840
Of course then again if you believe in Santa you probably should not be playing Mass Effect.

06:59.840 --> 07:00.840
Come to think of it.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.600
Why does Santa die in it?

07:02.600 --> 07:05.960
I don't know, possibly.

07:05.960 --> 07:12.400
Well for anyone who is at Penny Arcade Expo they did confirm that Penny Arcade Adventures

07:12.400 --> 07:18.920
on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade in 2008.

07:18.920 --> 07:23.420
It was also announced for PC, Mac OS X, and Linux.

07:23.420 --> 07:25.600
So hey, game!

07:25.600 --> 07:26.600
Cool.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.160
That's kind of interesting.

07:29.160 --> 07:32.320
Is that the console you guys would have guessed that this was going to be released on?

07:32.320 --> 07:33.320
Yep.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.880
I sort of thought so too.

07:34.880 --> 07:40.900
Just because you know there's the, for a long time now there's been the little picture icons

07:40.900 --> 07:45.800
and themes and all that stuff that you can download on Xbox Live so why not this?

07:45.800 --> 07:47.400
Why not now their game on Xbox Live?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.400
Why not?

07:48.400 --> 07:51.200
If there's more money to be done, why not?

07:51.200 --> 07:56.000
Well Penny Arcade Adventures isn't the only thing coming to Xbox Live soon.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.920
There is a rumor of course with the fall update due out in November that it's possibly going

08:00.920 --> 08:04.240
to include Xvid support.

08:04.240 --> 08:11.640
Now some other plans from this leaked list, supposedly a new Xbox Live Arcade Blade, IPTV

08:11.640 --> 08:18.600
support, integrated clan functionality, a picture in picture setting, and improved slideshow

08:18.600 --> 08:20.600
effects.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.500
That would be pretty awesome if it had Xvid codec support.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.120
What exactly is Xvid?

08:25.120 --> 08:26.380
It's kind of like Divx.

08:26.380 --> 08:33.880
It's a video codec for encoding MPEG4 video so that you can rip a DVD and have it be a

08:33.880 --> 08:35.920
decent file size.

08:35.920 --> 08:36.920
It's pretty popular.

08:36.920 --> 08:39.920
But you would still have to stream it.

08:39.920 --> 08:40.920
Yeah.

08:40.920 --> 08:44.240
Well I'm saying you still have to have it in WMV format, right?

08:44.240 --> 08:46.040
I don't know about that.

08:46.040 --> 08:51.320
I would imagine you would, but who knows?

08:51.320 --> 08:52.320
Interesting.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.360
Well, something that is definitive, I mean that's a rumor, but something definitive,

08:56.360 --> 09:00.960
although it's been rumored about for quite some time, is that Microsoft is taking a pass

09:00.960 --> 09:03.000
on going to E for All.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.280
I know a lot of people were very hopeful that Microsoft was going to be attending the show.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.280
I mean why not?

09:07.280 --> 09:11.320
Nintendo's going to the show, but apparently Microsoft has just decided there's better

09:11.320 --> 09:12.320
things to do.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.700
They're not going to the show.

09:13.700 --> 09:17.740
By the way, Sony is also not going to E for All.

09:17.740 --> 09:20.600
There's also some other companies that have said they're not going, including Capcom and

09:20.600 --> 09:21.600
so on.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.960
Some of the companies that are going, though, would be Nintendo and Konami.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.960
So it's not like it's going to be an empty show, but it is going to be a little bit of

09:27.960 --> 09:32.800
a bummer that you don't have two of the big three showing up at E for All.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.280
I don't know about you guys, but the fact that I'm actually kind of planning on going

09:36.280 --> 09:41.160
to E for All because I got an invite and everything and I was planning the trip to go to L.A.,

09:41.160 --> 09:45.360
I'm a little bit irritated that some of these companies are dropping out of E for All.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.440
That news makes me a little bit angsty.

09:47.440 --> 09:48.920
And when we get angsty, people die.

09:48.920 --> 09:54.000
Oh, and the FUs of the week come out.

09:54.000 --> 10:03.640
Oh, Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off with tonight's FUs?

10:03.640 --> 10:10.000
Um, FU to my broken head, really, it still hurts.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.560
You know, it happened, what, four hours ago?

10:12.560 --> 10:15.560
But it's not four, why does it say four?

10:15.560 --> 10:18.560
Three hours, two hours, whatever ago, and it still hurts.

10:18.560 --> 10:24.600
And a secondary FU goes toward the art block, because I've been trying to draw and it's

10:24.600 --> 10:26.880
just not working.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.920
So instead of writer's block, it's art block?

10:28.920 --> 10:29.920
It's art block.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.920
Oh, I've been having a bit of writer's block, too, just in different capacities.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.520
So FU to blocks of all shapes and sizes?

10:36.520 --> 10:39.920
To the block of creativity, there we go.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.920
All right, Loki, your FUs of the week.

10:41.920 --> 10:46.760
My FUs of the week go to my cat for constantly waking me up in the middle of the night.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.120
It's almost like having a goddamn baby, so.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.560
Fuck you to the cat.

10:51.560 --> 10:55.520
Just imagine when you really have a baby, imagine babies in your house.

10:55.520 --> 10:59.480
Yeah, that's very funny.

10:59.480 --> 11:03.120
I don't really have a lot to say FU to this week, I've actually had a pretty good week,

11:03.120 --> 11:08.640
so FU to people who don't like caramel, because caramel ice cream is awesome.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.600
But then again, maybe I shouldn't say FU to that, because that just means more for me,

11:11.600 --> 11:12.600
right?

11:12.600 --> 11:13.600
I don't know.

11:13.600 --> 11:17.440
Miggletob, do you have any FUs of the week, while you're staring off into space over there?

11:17.440 --> 11:26.240
FU to you for thinking about getting popsicles, because they are the worst.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.240
Popsicles are awesome.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.920
Here's the thing though, Miggletob, it wasn't that I was going to buy popsicles, I was going

11:30.920 --> 11:35.160
to buy creamsicles, and those are awesome.

11:35.160 --> 11:39.280
All right, let's end this segment now, shall we?

11:39.280 --> 11:42.320
Are either of you guys, is anybody else in here thinking of going to E for All?

11:42.320 --> 11:43.320
I was.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.120
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to go though.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.320
It doesn't excite me as much anymore.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.440
I would like to go.

11:48.440 --> 11:51.440
I'd rather go to PAX, but that's kind of late for that.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.760
It's a little bit over now.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.740
What's in it for you to see at E for All?

11:55.740 --> 12:00.320
I like Nintendo and Konami, and that's really all I remember that are actually going.

12:00.320 --> 12:05.080
But not having E3 to go to this year, and going to Comic Con made me realize that I

12:05.080 --> 12:10.240
kind of miss stuff like that, so going to E for All would be pretty cool.

12:10.240 --> 12:15.640
Let's get back to some gaming news, now that the FUs of the week are over.

12:15.640 --> 12:19.640
Well, you know, it was bound to happen.

12:19.640 --> 12:27.240
For our buddies overseas, the Xbox 360 is getting a price drop in Europe, occurring

12:27.240 --> 12:31.440
on the 24th of August.

12:31.440 --> 12:38.000
It will be decreasing by 20 pounds on the core unit, and 30 on the 20 gigabyte 360,

12:38.000 --> 12:48.400
it'll bring the price down respectively to $249.99, and I'm sorry, that's on the 20 gig,

12:48.400 --> 12:53.300
and $179.99 on the core.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.440
That's again in British pounds.

12:55.440 --> 12:59.800
Also, the Elite will retail for $299.99.

12:59.800 --> 13:07.160
All right, well, I just got to say real quickly for the live folks, it looks like our stream

13:07.160 --> 13:11.760
is down, and I'm blaming Operator 11 for that, so at this time I'm going to shut this off

13:11.760 --> 13:15.760
until we can work on this some other time, because it's probably taking a lot of bandwidth,

13:15.760 --> 13:18.340
so we're going to have to get rid of this to get our stream back, so that's the end

13:18.340 --> 13:21.880
of the Op 11 simulcast for now, until we can work on that a little later.

13:21.880 --> 13:22.880
Sorry, guys.

13:22.880 --> 13:26.080
All right, but in the meantime, we will go back to...

13:26.080 --> 13:27.640
There was more news on that.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:29.440 --> 13:37.380
The Shizzle Games of Belgium was advertising by price from Elite down to Core, and Euros

13:37.380 --> 13:47.120
as $449.99, $349.99, and $279.99 on their SKUs, and that's it.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.320
Actually, no, my apologies.

13:50.320 --> 13:55.640
Their Core was being called the Arcade, and then they have the Pro.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.480
Very bizarre, but anyway.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.280
That is kind of bizarre.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.640
It's even more bizarre that they're called Shizzle Games.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.120
Shizzle Games.

14:04.120 --> 14:11.520
Well, the rumor, of course, of that new arcade SKU for the Core system is actually supposed

14:11.520 --> 14:19.980
to be coming to the US as well, and same details, no definite launch date or anything like that,

14:19.980 --> 14:26.500
but it is allegedly supposed to come out over here as well.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.500
That's a good idea.

14:27.500 --> 14:33.200
Hey, the Core system's not bad, but I know a lot of people complain that they can't save

14:33.200 --> 14:40.240
their game, so now that that's going to be coming with a memory unit, that might be something

14:40.240 --> 14:44.720
to actually look into if you're not into the whole live downloading thing.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.920
Well, speaking of systems coming out in new shapes and sizes and all different types of

14:48.920 --> 14:53.740
colors, the PSP Slim is going to be coming out in a variety of different colors over

14:53.740 --> 14:55.200
there in Europe.

14:55.200 --> 15:01.660
On September 5th, Simpsons Yellow and Spider-Man Black and Red will be some new designs that

15:01.660 --> 15:06.400
are coming out for the PSP Slim over there in Europe, where, of course, when you talk

15:06.400 --> 15:11.400
about colors, that's C-O-L-O-U-R-S, ha ha ha.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.400
Just kidding.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.400
By the way...

15:13.400 --> 15:14.560
I bet you can't spell maneuver.

15:14.560 --> 15:19.480
As a reminder, over here stateside, you get some Star Wars themed colors, but you don't

15:19.480 --> 15:22.960
get the Simpsons or Spider-Man ones.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.280
So there you have it.

15:25.280 --> 15:29.880
Alright, well, moving on, Dark Soccer likes to surf the internet up and down and all around

15:29.880 --> 15:34.620
every single week, and she likes to find a website that works for all of you, and it's

15:34.620 --> 15:38.600
her website of the week that she's going to share with you guys right now.

15:38.600 --> 15:48.240
Website of the week is actually suggested to me by Loki, and it's actually pretty cool.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.880
It's Cult of Rapture.

15:49.880 --> 15:58.960
If you go to 2KGames.com slash Cult of Rapture, all one word, it will take you to a Bioshock

15:58.960 --> 16:02.280
page for the fans, I guess.

16:02.280 --> 16:09.880
Talking about the music that's out, has downloads, articles, a forum, goodies for everybody.

16:09.880 --> 16:10.880
It's pretty cool.

16:10.880 --> 16:11.880
It's very pretty.

16:11.880 --> 16:15.200
Yeah, it's actually very, very pretty.

16:15.200 --> 16:21.840
But I do believe that you have to be over 18 to the page, so go see it, I'll be posting

16:21.840 --> 16:26.640
the address into the chat room presently.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.640
Very cool.

16:27.640 --> 16:28.640
Alrighty.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.640
Awesome.

16:29.640 --> 16:37.000
Something else that's pretty awesome, fans of Geometry Wars will be quite happy, because

16:37.000 --> 16:43.640
with Project Gotham Racing 4, they'll be getting a brand new Geometry Wars game.

16:43.640 --> 16:50.440
And no info, though, on, it's supposed to be not too different than Retro Evolved, but

16:50.440 --> 16:55.400
it is going to be a little bit different, it's called Geometry War Waves.

16:55.400 --> 17:00.160
No real details, though, on what exactly is different, but apparently not that much.

17:00.160 --> 17:04.160
Well, I don't know what's going to change in the great amount of time it's going to

17:04.160 --> 17:08.560
take for this game to come out, because Spore is apparently finished.

17:08.560 --> 17:13.600
The game is not totally finished and ready to go, but apparently the game is complete.

17:13.600 --> 17:17.800
This is coming from reports of people who have had a hands-on with Spore at Leipzig.

17:17.800 --> 17:22.160
EA is simply going to be spending the next few months listening to feedback from players,

17:22.160 --> 17:27.320
assuming the QA testers and beta testers, to tweak and polish Spore for its final release,

17:27.320 --> 17:30.200
which is still set for next spring.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.560
So certainly you can look around the internet on some different blogs there and find some

17:33.560 --> 17:38.240
hands-on reports from Spore, which is definitely a game I am certainly looking forward to.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.080
So GS68 in our chat room says, Spore forever?

17:41.080 --> 17:42.080
I don't think so.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.840
I don't think you can make those jokes anymore, because it does look like this game is actually

17:44.840 --> 17:45.840
going to come out.

17:45.840 --> 17:46.840
Hooray!

17:46.840 --> 17:47.840
So, we'll see.

17:47.840 --> 17:48.840
All right.

17:48.840 --> 17:53.880
Anyway, it's time for an old favorite segment of ours here on Orange Lounge Radio.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.160
It's a segment we like to call Listless.

17:57.160 --> 18:03.960
All right.

18:03.960 --> 18:07.240
The way Listless works is that we create a list here.

18:07.240 --> 18:11.440
We're trying to define the definitive top three of a certain category, and tonight's

18:11.440 --> 18:17.600
category is character we would most like to see in the upcoming track and field DS game.

18:17.600 --> 18:22.280
Now, the character does not have to be a Konami character, but it helps.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.280
Okay?

18:23.280 --> 18:24.280
So, here's the deal.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.280
Here's how it works.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.800
We're going to go around, and myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and Miklotov will all give their

18:28.800 --> 18:29.800
top three.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.480
So that's going to leave us with a list of 12.

18:32.480 --> 18:38.160
Then we will all go around the room and take one unworthy candidate off the list, leaving

18:38.160 --> 18:40.120
a list of eight.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.480
And we will post that list of eight to the chat room, and you'll vote for your number

18:43.480 --> 18:45.480
one and your number two picks.

18:45.480 --> 18:49.980
We'll tally them up, and the winning votes will be revealed a little later in the show.

18:49.980 --> 18:51.560
That's how Listless works.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.200
So who's going to start us off tonight?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.200
Loki, you ready to go?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.200
Sure.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.200
All right.

18:57.200 --> 19:02.120
What's your number three pick for character you would most like to see in track and field?

19:02.120 --> 19:07.600
I guess it'd be a little weird, but I would like to see... Actually, this is kind of

19:07.600 --> 19:11.040
a baby lawn from DDR 5th Mix.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.280
Ah, baby lawn from DDR 5th Mix.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.280
Why?

19:14.280 --> 19:15.280
Just so you can run us a baby or what?

19:15.280 --> 19:16.600
Because it's a baby running.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.600
It's funny.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.600
I don't know.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.160
All right.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.160
Baby lawn, says Loki.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.600
Miklotov, do you have a number three pick?

19:25.600 --> 19:31.760
I'll take Robbie the rabbit from Silent Hill, because what's cuter than a bunny with blood

19:31.760 --> 19:35.200
on its mouth running around throwing stuff like javelins and things?

19:35.200 --> 19:37.520
We're already picking just Konami.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.320
Dude, you don't have to pick Konami.

19:40.320 --> 19:47.400
I said it doesn't have to be Konami, but it helps, because the real game... Yeah, it

19:47.400 --> 19:48.400
could be Nintendo, because it's DS51.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.400
Let's leave it to Konami and Nintendo.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.400
Oh, God.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.400
I have to rethink my list.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.400
All right.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.160
I'll come up with some ideas.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.480
Dark Soccer, your number three pick.

19:57.480 --> 20:01.400
Aitsu or Koitsu from Parodius.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.320
They're the little stickmen riding paper airplanes.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.320
How the crap do you spell that?

20:05.320 --> 20:10.440
A-I-T-S-U and then K-O-I-T-S-U.

20:10.440 --> 20:11.440
From Parodius.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.440
Yes.

20:12.440 --> 20:16.400
All right.

20:16.400 --> 20:21.840
My number three pick would also come from DDR, and that would be Alice, the little raving

20:21.840 --> 20:26.160
character, because I think it would be funny for her to do a bunch of ecstasy and then

20:26.160 --> 20:29.160
compete in Olympic events.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.440
Her heart might explode right there on the track.

20:31.440 --> 20:35.800
So I pick Alice, the raver girl from DDR Fifth Mix, plus a lot of the boys think Alice is

20:35.800 --> 20:38.920
hot, so I'm sure you'll enjoy that, and some of the girls.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.560
Loki, your number two pick.

20:40.560 --> 20:47.400
This is also kind of tying in with Konami stuff, but I'm not sure what you would really

20:47.400 --> 20:48.680
call it.

20:48.680 --> 20:55.000
The dog from Silent Hill 2, from the dog ending, the Shiba Inu.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
That's fantastic.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.320
I love the dog.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.920
So the dog from the dog ending of Silent Hill 2.

20:59.920 --> 21:00.920
Good pick.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.960
Mikol Tov, your number two pick.

21:03.960 --> 21:12.960
I'm going to say Evil Rose, from Rumble Roses, because what little boy doesn't want to watch

21:12.960 --> 21:17.800
the girls with the big breasts run around on the track, except for sane ones.

21:17.800 --> 21:18.800
All right.

21:18.800 --> 21:22.440
So one of the big titty girls from Rumble Roses will hopefully appear on track and field.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.440
She can't run.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.440
All right.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.440
Dark Sakura, your number two pick.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.560
My number two pick is going to be Pit.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.200
Pit, from now a Nintendo character.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.200
Okay, fair enough.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.240
If he says we're Nintendo, I said Pit.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.240
All right.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.240
Pit from Kid Icarus.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.240
Why not?

21:37.240 --> 21:38.240
That would be fun.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.240
Except he can fly.

21:39.240 --> 21:40.240
Couldn't that be cheating?

21:40.240 --> 21:41.240
So can Aizu and Koizu.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.240
All right.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.240
Moving on.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.040
Number two pick for me.

21:45.040 --> 21:49.720
My number two pick I would like to see in the game would be Dracula, from the Castlevania

21:49.720 --> 21:50.720
games.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.720
You know, why not?

21:51.720 --> 21:53.760
And then somebody can come out and say...

21:53.760 --> 21:54.760
Not by my hand.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.800
I was once again given a gold medal.

21:57.800 --> 21:58.800
Die, monster.

21:58.800 --> 21:59.800
You don't belong in this world.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.120
Except that was the other guy that said that.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.000
But I still think it would be cool if Dracula was in the game.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.280
So Dracula is my number two pick.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.640
Number one pick, Sloki.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.640
Oh, man.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.960
Oh, let's see.

22:12.960 --> 22:18.400
Number one pick, I will say, well, that doesn't really count because that's Hudson.

22:18.400 --> 22:23.560
Well, no, that could work because Konami has license over Hudson games now, right?

22:23.560 --> 22:24.560
Yeah.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.560
You can do Hudson.

22:25.560 --> 22:30.680
I don't know if this would be my number one pick, but Bomberman.

22:30.680 --> 22:37.360
Okay, because maybe Bomberman could just leave bombs on the track, yes?

22:37.360 --> 22:38.360
Sure.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.360
That'll work.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.360
Yeah, sure.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.360
Right.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.360
Whatever you say, Rob.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.360
All right.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.080
Miklotov, what would be your number one pick?

22:45.080 --> 22:52.560
The left DDR arrow, because I think that would be pretty awesome.

22:52.560 --> 22:56.560
So you just want to be the DDR arrow in the game.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.560
Oops.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.400
I totally didn't spell arrow right there.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.400
Let's try that again.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.400
There we go.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.400
Much better.

23:02.400 --> 23:06.560
So just the floating arrow would be a character with legs.

23:06.560 --> 23:09.960
Maybe not with legs, but a sweatband.

23:09.960 --> 23:10.960
You are weird.

23:10.960 --> 23:12.000
All right.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.320
Dark Sakura, your number one pick.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.760
My number one pick is the mascot from Guitar Freak.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.840
You need to lift the bag over his head.

23:18.840 --> 23:21.840
I don't remember his name.

23:21.840 --> 23:24.280
I just put Guitar Freak bag over head guy.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.280
Okay.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.280
Why is that?

23:26.280 --> 23:27.280
What?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.280
Oh, I had an excellent idea for one, but...

23:28.280 --> 23:29.280
It's too late now.

23:29.280 --> 23:30.280
Yeah, it's too late.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.280
All right.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.280
We'll see.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.280
Okay.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.020
My number one pick.

23:35.020 --> 23:39.580
My number one pick did not get a lot of coverage in a lot of the various Konami games that

23:39.580 --> 23:41.640
existed out there.

23:41.640 --> 23:49.560
In fact, my number one pick was really obscure, because he was only in one game that Konami

23:49.560 --> 23:52.120
ever put out, and it was on the PC.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.120
But I'll tell you what.

23:53.120 --> 23:56.680
If you've been listening to this show for some amount of time, then you know the love

23:56.680 --> 24:01.440
that the people of this program have for Mr. Spanky from DDR PC.

24:01.440 --> 24:06.900
And that is my number one pick, would be Mr. Spanky, the guy that's dressed up like a dominatrix

24:06.900 --> 24:09.040
character from DDR PC.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.360
Because then the game would be rated M, and no one would get to play it.

24:11.360 --> 24:14.160
So that actually doesn't turn out to be such a good idea.

24:14.160 --> 24:17.120
But hey, this is supposed to be a fantasy.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.160
My runner up would be the Konami code.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.160
Just have the...

24:21.160 --> 24:23.760
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.000
Have the Konami code in it.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
No, no, no.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.360
Oh, I should have said the little ship from Parodius, because then you can have the sound

24:29.360 --> 24:31.000
blaster, or Twinbee.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.720
You know what also amazes me about this list?

24:32.720 --> 24:35.440
Is that not a single damn Metal Gear character on the whole list.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.540
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

24:37.540 --> 24:38.540
That about Tastra.

24:38.540 --> 24:42.360
Change Baghead Guy to Twinbee.

24:42.360 --> 24:43.360
Twinbee?

24:43.360 --> 24:44.360
Twinbee.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.360
All right.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.360
I'm going to try it better.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.360
All right.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.360
All right.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.360
Well, she changed it then.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.360
Twinbee.

24:51.360 --> 24:52.360
Let's see.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.280
SSJ100 Matt voted for the goalie from Blade of Steel.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.280
That's pretty awesome.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.280
All right.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.280
Here's the list of stands right now.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.440
But remember, we're going around and eliminating off the list here.

24:59.440 --> 25:05.700
Baby Lawn, Robby the Rabbit, Aitsu Koitsu, Alice, the dog from the dog inning of Silent

25:05.700 --> 25:14.800
Hill 2, Evil Rose, Pit, Dracula, Bomberman, the left DDR arrow, Twinbee, and Mr. Spanky.

25:14.800 --> 25:15.800
Why left and not right?

25:15.800 --> 25:16.800
Just out of curiosity.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.400
Because it's just the first one I thought of.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.400
All right.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.860
Loki, one of these is not worthy of being on the list.

25:23.860 --> 25:29.360
What is not worthy of being on the list?

25:29.360 --> 25:34.800
I'm just going to say Aitsu Koitsu because I have no idea what the hell that is.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.800
Very obscure.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.200
Yeah, that was a little too obscure for my taste.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.200
They're awesome.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.200
All right.

25:39.200 --> 25:41.880
Miklotov, one of these is not worthy of being on the list.

25:41.880 --> 25:45.720
What is not worthy of being on the list?

25:45.720 --> 25:50.000
Just because it really looks out of place on that list, I'm going to throw out Pit even

25:50.000 --> 25:55.240
though I love Kid Icarus a whole lot and yeah, I'm sorry.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.240
All right.

25:56.240 --> 26:02.020
Dark Sakura, what is not worthy of the list?

26:02.020 --> 26:09.200
I'm going to vote for Alice.

26:09.200 --> 26:14.200
Alice is not worthy of being on the list and raver kids everywhere are crying.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.200
What does that mean, Miklotov?

26:15.200 --> 26:17.200
Have you seen Alice from Supernova 2 yet?

26:17.200 --> 26:21.200
She's all dressed up like an idiot and weirdo.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.200
All right.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.200
Well, whatever.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.200
Let's see.

26:24.200 --> 26:28.600
The one I deem worthy of not being on the list is... Oh, this is hard.

26:28.600 --> 26:32.520
I'm also going to take out a DDR character and say Baby Lawn is not worthy of being on

26:32.520 --> 26:33.520
the list.

26:33.520 --> 26:34.980
So there you go.

26:34.980 --> 26:37.800
That leaves our list as... There's a little nudity in that card.

26:37.800 --> 26:41.760
All right, that leaves our list as Robbie the Rabbit, the dog from the dog-ending of

26:41.760 --> 26:50.080
Silent Hill 2, Evil Rose, Dracula, Bomberman, the left DDR arrow, Twinbee, and Mr. Spanky.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.080
All right.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.080
So I'm going to post that there in the chat room and if you would, send a private message

26:54.080 --> 26:58.000
to Rob Roberts, not Sky tonight because I don't have my normal name.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.280
Send a private message with your number one and number two pick.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.920
It is important what you designate as one and two.

27:04.920 --> 27:08.800
If you do not designate, I will assume your first pick is your number one.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.600
So there you have it.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.920
Did you find anything else that you thought should have been on the list, Loki, because

27:14.920 --> 27:17.400
I saw you searching Wikipedia frantically?

27:17.400 --> 27:22.080
I was trying to think whatever... I don't remember what the boss was called in Contra,

27:22.080 --> 27:23.080
like the giant heart.

27:23.080 --> 27:26.000
I was thinking the giant alien head thing would have been pretty awesome.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.640
What about the vomiting baby turtle thing or whatever that was from like...

27:29.640 --> 27:36.040
Aw, we should have more time to prepare, a vomiting baby turtle would have been awesome.

27:36.040 --> 27:40.720
An unsold copy of, what was it, Bomberman Act Zero.

27:40.720 --> 27:45.280
I was actually thinking, because you know, I was thinking really obscure.

27:45.280 --> 27:50.440
You know, if we were going Sega, I'd totally say the Oppa Oppa.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.440
But we didn't go Sega.

27:51.440 --> 27:52.440
No, we didn't.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.440
We sure didn't.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.440
Because the Oppa Oppa would kill everybody.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.440
Right.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.480
Because the Oppa Oppa's awesome.

27:56.480 --> 28:00.240
We will announce the winners a wee bit later, but for now we've got to get back into some

28:00.240 --> 28:05.800
news and then the Skype line, your calls at Orange Lounge Radio username on Skype or our

28:05.800 --> 28:08.480
800 number 1877 game OLR.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.200
We'll get to those very shortly, but first a little more news.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.200
Loki.

28:12.200 --> 28:19.360
Yes, and apparently people were not too happy with BioShock's way they've handled widescreen,

28:19.360 --> 28:24.260
and apparently there are some fixes though if you want to correct that.

28:24.260 --> 28:31.960
There is a hack that you can download for the PC version and it will allow you to, not

28:31.960 --> 28:36.720
necessarily resize your screen, but resize the view on there.

28:36.720 --> 28:43.080
And you can do all sorts of fun things, including different resolution sizes like 16.9, true

28:43.080 --> 28:44.080
16.9.

28:44.080 --> 28:48.240
Because apparently the way this game worked before is they would just kind of do like

28:48.240 --> 28:50.480
a reverse pan and scan on it.

28:50.480 --> 28:54.160
They would cut the top and bottom off on the widescreen.

28:54.160 --> 29:01.200
But apparently there's also, I guess there's going to be a fix coming for Xbox 360 over

29:01.200 --> 29:04.640
live at some point as well, at least that's a rumor.

29:04.640 --> 29:11.720
So if that's really bothering you, you can go ahead and download the patch, which is

29:11.720 --> 29:23.360
available it looks like on dl.tocaedit.com slash BioShockDFOV.zip.

29:23.360 --> 29:27.000
Loki out of curiosity, what do you think about that whole fallout about how people were really

29:27.000 --> 29:32.960
pissed about all the issues the PC was having, not just the widescreen stuff, but the fact

29:32.960 --> 29:36.520
that you could only install so many copies on one machine and kind of like how quick

29:36.520 --> 29:39.360
they've been to respond to that.

29:39.360 --> 29:43.780
The whole widescreen thing was stupid, I think, because I mean personally I don't think anyone

29:43.780 --> 29:48.440
noticed it during the demo until someone mentioned, oh hey, by the way, this is like that.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.720
They're all, oh my God, that's horrible.

29:50.720 --> 29:55.480
I mean it doesn't just detract anything from the game, so big deal.

29:55.480 --> 29:59.360
I mean you can fix it on the PC now, so I don't know, it's not a big deal.

29:59.360 --> 30:01.360
The cop protection thing kind of sucks.

30:01.360 --> 30:06.120
I know a lot of people are like installing on multiple computers, which I guess technically

30:06.120 --> 30:11.480
violates some sort of rights or something, I don't know, but there's a fix coming for

30:11.480 --> 30:18.160
that as well, so I don't think that's a big worry, but yeah, little bitty things.

30:18.160 --> 30:23.200
All right, SSJ100Matt says, though Pan and Scan ruins movies.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.200
It does.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.880
It absolutely does.

30:25.880 --> 30:26.880
I agree, actually.

30:26.880 --> 30:30.760
All right, let's open up our Skype line and hear from you guys.

30:30.760 --> 30:33.360
If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is now open.

30:33.360 --> 30:39.640
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, or you can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR

30:39.640 --> 30:43.960
is the number to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

30:43.960 --> 30:48.120
And while we're waiting for those to come in, I'll just say that this is your last chance

30:48.120 --> 30:50.600
to submit your votes for listless.

30:50.600 --> 30:55.040
I think most people in our chat room already voted, but just in case, there's a couple

30:55.040 --> 30:57.960
stragglers, we'll take those.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.000
Let's go to the phones.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
This is Ravenstaufen.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Well, hello.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
The guy, that guy.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.780
Damn, you get through first every time.

31:07.780 --> 31:08.780
How is that?

31:08.780 --> 31:09.780
All right, well, what's on your mind, Ravenstaufen?

31:09.780 --> 31:12.400
I have a fast finger and a new keyboard.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.520
I'll leave the fast finger comment as is.

31:14.520 --> 31:15.520
Well, what's on your mind?

31:15.520 --> 31:18.720
Lame mean finger.

31:18.720 --> 31:24.260
My comment tonight is you mentioned that Nintendo surpassed the 360?

31:24.260 --> 31:27.400
In terms of worldwide sales, yes.

31:27.400 --> 31:33.080
Well, you know, I know this is going to turn into a flame world real fast and real quick,

31:33.080 --> 31:35.520
so I'll try to keep the flames to a minimum.

31:35.520 --> 31:39.960
But you know, I believe that people that buy in the Wii is not us hardcore gamers.

31:39.960 --> 31:43.640
Like we bought it, I bought it, you bought it, Loki bought it, Dark Soccer bought it,

31:43.640 --> 31:45.760
but those soccer moms of the world.

31:45.760 --> 31:50.200
No, I totally agree with you, but the sale is a sale, right?

31:50.200 --> 31:51.200
Sales is a sale.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.200
Money is money, right?

31:52.200 --> 31:53.800
The bottom line is a dollar.

31:53.800 --> 31:59.480
However, I will say this, what I would be curious to see is how many games per system

31:59.480 --> 32:00.480
is out there.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.480
You know what I mean?

32:01.480 --> 32:04.880
Like a 360 owner probably has a lot of games at this point, whereas a Wii owner maybe doesn't

32:04.880 --> 32:06.000
have so many games.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.320
But I don't know, that may not be true because then again, you look at the games that are

32:09.320 --> 32:11.720
out on the Wii, there's not a lot for hardcore gamers.

32:11.720 --> 32:12.720
I mean, there's some.

32:12.720 --> 32:16.580
You know, you're Super Paper Mario, you're Metroid, but there is a lot of crap out there

32:16.580 --> 32:17.580
on the Wii.

32:17.580 --> 32:18.580
Like Boogie?

32:18.580 --> 32:21.800
Your Happy Feets, well, I haven't played Boogie, but I don't know.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.820
But that commercial really wants me, I'm memorized about that commercial of Boogie.

32:25.820 --> 32:30.440
It almost wants me to buy it, but my mind goes like, don't buy it, it's junk.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.560
Don't buy it, don't fall for it.

32:32.560 --> 32:35.040
I've never seen the commercial, but I don't watch TV.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.480
What's it like?

32:37.480 --> 32:40.120
It's they're doing a disco one, and they're like doing the Wii mode.

32:40.120 --> 32:44.080
It has nothing to do with the game, no gameplay footage whatsoever.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.120
But the commercials, I think it was great.

32:46.120 --> 32:50.240
You know, I'm like, wow, that looks like fun, and then I smack myself going like, shit,

32:50.240 --> 32:51.500
it's not fun.

32:51.500 --> 32:55.360
But they do show you how to actually play the game in the commercial, because they do

32:55.360 --> 33:00.000
have the Wii mode and the nunchuck moving back and forth, and what I assume is how you're

33:00.000 --> 33:02.120
supposed to play that piece of crap game.

33:02.120 --> 33:06.720
And then I smack myself, and then I set free.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.520
Yeah, renting might be a thing to do.

33:08.520 --> 33:13.960
Ross Steel UT says, problem is that most people are just buying it as a Wii sports machine,

33:13.960 --> 33:15.760
and will never buy anything for it.

33:15.760 --> 33:18.280
Well, what about Wii Play, though, because Wii Play's been selling a lot.

33:18.280 --> 33:21.040
And how come the PlayStation 2's still selling?

33:21.040 --> 33:23.000
Gold Banjo, I think same reason, actually.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.600
Gold Banjo says, my little sister sings along during that commercial.

33:25.600 --> 33:29.320
I think the PlayStation 2 continues to sell, because they're A, cheap, and B, there's a

33:29.320 --> 33:31.400
shitload of games for it.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.160
I mean, just massive and massive amounts of games for it.

33:34.160 --> 33:35.160
So.

33:35.160 --> 33:36.160
All right.

33:36.160 --> 33:37.160
One more thing.

33:37.160 --> 33:39.520
Of course, one more thing, sir.

33:39.520 --> 33:43.560
You know, the new release of Bioshock came out, and I was just wondering, do you think

33:43.560 --> 33:47.600
this game's going to be buried like Dead Rising when it came out in the first?

33:47.600 --> 33:52.000
Dead Rising's one of those games that everyone loved, played, you know, Loki loved it, I

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
loved it.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.120
Is Bioshock going to fall under that, like, we love it, and we leave it for, like, another

33:57.120 --> 33:58.120
game?

33:58.120 --> 34:01.640
I'm going to take a very controversial stance here, and I'm going to say yes.

34:01.640 --> 34:06.320
It will fall off the radar because of lack of multiplayer, because I think people are

34:06.320 --> 34:11.920
going to go, like, just kill through the game in the single player mode, and then, you know,

34:11.920 --> 34:15.840
while there will be a few that will replay it, and the faithful that will show it to

34:15.840 --> 34:19.920
their friends and replay it, I think when Halo 3 comes out, a lot of people are going

34:19.920 --> 34:23.560
to go over there, and Halo 3 is going to have the lasting multiplayer.

34:23.560 --> 34:27.520
So I, you know, and I realized, you know, I could be wrong, but I think the lack of

34:27.520 --> 34:31.520
multiplayer, also very similar to Dead Rising, I think the lack of multiplayer is really

34:31.520 --> 34:32.600
going to hurt the game.

34:32.600 --> 34:39.640
But at the same time, I think Bioshock will trump Halo 3 on some end-of-year best lists.

34:39.640 --> 34:43.200
So I think you may see a small resurgence come the end of the year during award times.

34:43.200 --> 34:48.000
Yeah, I'm just saying that because, you know, this game has, you know, everyone loved it.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
You know, it's like, you know, what's that game I'm trying to think of?

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Floss Planet.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.080
You know, everyone played it at, like, for two weeks, and then the next game came out

34:55.080 --> 34:59.000
with Graw, and then everyone went, oh, what's this, and then dropped it like a lead balloon.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.760
Well, that's a lot of the Xbox Live Arcade releases, too.

35:01.760 --> 35:06.680
I mean, how many people on your friends list do you see playing Street Fighter II anymore?

35:06.680 --> 35:09.520
How many people are still playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night?

35:09.520 --> 35:10.520
Doom.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.520
Doom.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.960
My hand is raised because we were playing it recently.

35:13.960 --> 35:16.600
Well, okay, so one person on the entire internet is playing it.

35:16.600 --> 35:17.600
No, I'm just kidding.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.800
I'm not a supporting person on the internet.

35:19.800 --> 35:23.080
But if I look at my friends list, I do not see people playing a lot of the old arcade

35:23.080 --> 35:28.160
releases except for a few big, big biggies, like Geometry Wars.

35:28.160 --> 35:31.280
Pac-Man Championship Edition still comes up.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.480
So a couple of those.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.480
That is it.

35:34.480 --> 35:35.480
Thank you for taking my call.

35:35.480 --> 35:36.480
You're welcome.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.480
One more comment here really quickly.

35:37.480 --> 35:41.400
DJ Kibbles and Bits in chat says, the thing is, a lot of people stopped playing Dead Rising

35:41.400 --> 35:43.240
because of that damn save system.

35:43.240 --> 35:46.960
Yeah, that was definitely one of my, why I stopped playing.

35:46.960 --> 35:51.200
After a while, it just got too annoying to keep replaying it over and over again.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.360
Yeah, they screwed up that save system.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.640
You had to go pee or take a poop or sleep.

35:56.640 --> 35:59.080
That was dumb.

35:59.080 --> 36:02.960
Rasteel UT says lots of people play games and don't go on live.

36:02.960 --> 36:06.360
That's true, but I'm using the rationalization that you have to go on live to get the game

36:06.360 --> 36:12.200
in the first place, unless it was on that arcade unplugged disc, but I truly think that's

36:12.200 --> 36:13.440
in the minority.

36:13.440 --> 36:14.440
One more comment.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.440
Yes.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.320
You would think that a mall that's so big would have more bathrooms.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.320
No.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.320
All right.

36:19.320 --> 36:21.920
Ravenstaufen, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, buddy, okay?

36:21.920 --> 36:22.920
You too, bye.

36:22.920 --> 36:23.920
All right.

36:23.920 --> 36:32.520
Again, if you want to give us a call, our number 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on

36:32.520 --> 36:38.240
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and there's lots of calls coming in, but unfortunately Skype

36:38.240 --> 36:42.080
is only allowing me to take one call at a time.

36:42.080 --> 36:47.040
Oh my gosh, this is a mess.

36:47.040 --> 36:53.280
All right, I'm going to have to... Hold on guys, we're going to change the options here

36:53.280 --> 36:57.720
in Skype so that only fricking one call can come through at a time.

36:57.720 --> 36:58.720
This is annoying.

36:58.720 --> 37:02.680
Loki, do you have any last minute stories while I change this real quick here?

37:02.680 --> 37:03.680
Yes I do.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.680
Thank you.

37:04.680 --> 37:05.680
Give us one real quick.

37:05.680 --> 37:11.260
Okay, real quick, there's some interesting things coming out about the brand new Brain

37:11.260 --> 37:15.400
Age 2 DS, the one that, you know, red and black, whatever.

37:15.400 --> 37:20.760
Apparently the LCD screen's a little bit dimmer than the normal DS Lite.

37:20.760 --> 37:25.800
Uh oh, that sucks for people that bought it.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.240
Let's see, enter interesting things.

37:28.240 --> 37:36.600
There was a PSP petition for Resident Evil coming onto the PSP, it got the attention

37:36.600 --> 37:46.400
of Capcom, who says if you get over 10,000 signatures that will draw significant attention,

37:46.400 --> 37:53.120
and now they're up to 17,000 signatures, so maybe we'll see a PSP version of Resident

37:53.120 --> 37:54.120
Evil.

37:54.120 --> 37:57.400
Hold on, I fixed Skype, so save the rest for a little later, all righty?

37:57.400 --> 37:58.400
Okay.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.400
Can you do that?

37:59.400 --> 38:00.400
All right.

38:00.400 --> 38:01.400
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

38:01.400 --> 38:02.400
Who's this?

38:02.400 --> 38:03.400
GS68.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.400
What's on your mind, GS68?

38:05.400 --> 38:12.880
Well, I noticed that all of the games on the Virtual Console are, well, console games.

38:12.880 --> 38:18.840
I haven't heard anything about Game Boy games being on the Virtual Console or Game Boy Color

38:18.840 --> 38:19.840
games.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.640
That's an interesting thought.

38:21.640 --> 38:24.960
We don't hear, I mean we always hear about all these systems coming to the Virtual Console

38:24.960 --> 38:30.840
and now we even talk about CDs, but yet we never have the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance

38:30.840 --> 38:33.400
even or Game Boy Color ever talked about.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.400
Why is that, you guys?

38:34.400 --> 38:37.200
Do you think there's a reason why Nintendo doesn't put these games out on Wii Virtual

38:37.200 --> 38:39.560
Console?

38:39.560 --> 38:43.680
Because you really don't need to play a black and white version of Mario Brothers.

38:43.680 --> 38:44.680
On the big screen TV?

38:44.680 --> 38:46.320
Yeah, it just wouldn't look good.

38:46.320 --> 38:51.720
I would actually like to see them port crappy Metroid 2 from Game Boy onto the Virtual Console

38:51.720 --> 38:55.800
because that game was a pain to play on the original Game Boy.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.760
I think actually playing it on TV would make it a worthwhile experience.

38:58.760 --> 39:03.840
Or how about they do a Metroid All-Stars where they just redesign the game and upgrade the

39:03.840 --> 39:04.840
graphics?

39:04.840 --> 39:05.840
Yeah, that would be good too.

39:05.840 --> 39:09.240
Oh, and Kid Icarus on Game Boy, even though I'm not sure if it's a good game at all, but

39:09.240 --> 39:10.600
I would still like to play that too.

39:10.600 --> 39:15.080
There's a lot of games back then that I missed out on because I was too little and now I

39:15.080 --> 39:22.640
want to play them, but they're impossible to find unless I emulate them.

39:22.640 --> 39:25.200
GS68, what are your thoughts on that?

39:25.200 --> 39:31.760
Well, I don't really know a lot of good Game Boy games.

39:31.760 --> 39:35.960
Like there are the games that I grew up with and that's about it.

39:35.960 --> 39:38.120
Holy crap, I can hear myself.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.560
What got you thinking about this?

39:39.560 --> 39:43.300
I don't know, just randomly I guess.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.400
That's all good.

39:44.400 --> 39:48.600
You know what would actually be really cool though would be, even though the DS doesn't

39:48.600 --> 39:53.200
play the old Game Boy games, it would be kind of cool if there was that functionality between

39:53.200 --> 39:57.440
the DS and the Wii a little later on, which we all know there is some functionality there,

39:57.440 --> 40:00.720
where maybe you could download a virtual console game from the Game Boy and play it on your

40:00.720 --> 40:01.720
DS.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.280
Wouldn't that be kind of neat?

40:03.280 --> 40:07.680
But I haven't heard any news about the DS Wii connectivity yet.

40:07.680 --> 40:11.560
The only thing I've really heard is Pokemon Battle Revolution, which isn't a whole lot.

40:11.560 --> 40:12.560
Oh yeah.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.560
That's really it.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.280
Well, GSXC, that was a good thought.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.200
Anything else you want to comment on tonight?

40:17.200 --> 40:21.960
If Mr. Spanky wins the list list, I'll make videos of myself killing patients in trauma

40:21.960 --> 40:22.960
center.

40:22.960 --> 40:27.200
Alright, so if Mr. Spanky wins list list, you're going to kill patients in trauma centers

40:27.200 --> 40:28.200
and put it on the YouTubes.

40:28.200 --> 40:31.400
Well, we're going to find out very soon what won.

40:31.400 --> 40:36.480
Just out of curiosity, can you describe your hatred of Mr. Spanky to the listeners who

40:36.480 --> 40:38.480
may not be familiar with the character?

40:38.480 --> 40:49.480
Well, I heard him on, well, I heard his voice on many episodes ago, and, well, I didn't

40:49.480 --> 40:50.480
really like it.

40:50.480 --> 40:53.520
I'm sorry to hear that, although you know that wasn't the official voice, right?

40:53.520 --> 40:56.840
That was just some idiot pretending, right?

40:56.840 --> 40:57.840
Yeah.

40:57.840 --> 41:01.480
I am noticing there is no article on Mr. Spanky on Wikipedia.

41:01.480 --> 41:05.360
I was hoping for some pictures or something, like an article I could refer people to, but

41:05.360 --> 41:06.360
there's nothing.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.480
Did you spell it with an E?

41:07.480 --> 41:08.640
I did it both ways.

41:08.640 --> 41:12.080
I did it once with an E and once with no E. How about, yeah, DDR PC?

41:12.080 --> 41:15.080
DDR PC, let me see.

41:15.080 --> 41:18.400
No, there's no DDR PC article either.

41:18.400 --> 41:22.760
There's just a Dance Dance Revolution main article.

41:22.760 --> 41:25.440
How is there no Mr. Spanky article on Wikipedia?

41:25.440 --> 41:27.160
He's an important part of the culture.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.560
Well, he's a DDR character.

41:29.560 --> 41:32.600
You don't really deserve to know about Wikipedia articles.

41:32.600 --> 41:33.600
I don't get it.

41:33.600 --> 41:34.600
Alright.

41:34.600 --> 41:35.600
I'm sick of looking.

41:35.600 --> 41:36.600
Wait, no I'm not.

41:36.600 --> 41:40.400
Yeah, there's no article for the Windows PC version of Dance Dance Revolution.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.400
Sadness.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.400
Alright.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.200
Anyway, I'm done.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.040
Anything else you want to share with us, GS68?

41:46.040 --> 41:47.840
No, I'm good.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.040
Alright, well have a good one GS68.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.040
We'll talk to you next time.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.040
Thanks, you too.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.440
Bye-bye.

41:54.440 --> 42:00.320
I'm hoping one of our Wikipedia faithful will somehow create that Mr. Spanky article.

42:00.320 --> 42:01.880
That would be all kinds of awesome.

42:01.880 --> 42:02.880
Let's go to another call.

42:02.880 --> 42:03.880
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

42:03.880 --> 42:04.880
Who's this?

42:04.880 --> 42:05.880
Hey, guys.

42:05.880 --> 42:06.880
Hello, Insanist.

42:06.880 --> 42:08.520
Hello, Insanist.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.800
What is on your mind?

42:10.800 --> 42:15.040
I don't know if you guys know, but that Penny Arcade Expo thing went on, and if you can

42:15.040 --> 42:18.640
tell, I have absolutely no voice from being at it all weekend.

42:18.640 --> 42:19.760
Oh, wow.

42:19.760 --> 42:21.920
I think Penny Arcade Expo should happen more often.

42:21.920 --> 42:23.240
It kills your voice.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.320
Yeah, fuck you too, buddy.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.320
Alright.

42:26.320 --> 42:31.160
Well, I wanted to go to Penny Arcade Expo really, really badly, but here's the hilarious

42:31.160 --> 42:32.160
part.

42:32.160 --> 42:36.880
The largest showing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show anywhere in the world was also this weekend

42:36.880 --> 42:40.520
in Reno where they have like 4,000 people come out and see the movie, so I wanted to

42:40.520 --> 42:41.520
go to that.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.160
Penny Arcade Expo was also this weekend.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.920
I wanted to go to that, but guess what trumped both of those things?

42:45.920 --> 42:49.960
One of my best friends from college got married over the weekend, so I went to the wedding

42:49.960 --> 42:50.960
on Saturday.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.360
So congratulations, Amanda and Tom.

42:52.360 --> 42:55.560
Wave, wave, wave hug, although I know they don't listen to this program, but they got

42:55.560 --> 42:57.600
married, so I had to go.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.400
Well, how was Penny Arcade Expo?

42:59.400 --> 43:00.400
So you were there.

43:00.400 --> 43:01.760
You were our man on the street.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.480
What's going on?

43:03.480 --> 43:10.080
Well, what was really disappointing was Sony really didn't bring much to the show.

43:10.080 --> 43:13.600
In fact, it was something outside of Sony's booth that was for the Playstation 3, which

43:13.600 --> 43:17.480
I gave the unofficial OLR seal of approval.

43:17.480 --> 43:19.680
This game called Eye of Judgment.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.320
It's a collectible card game that works with the PS3.

43:22.320 --> 43:23.320
Wait a minute.

43:23.320 --> 43:26.640
You gave the OLR award to the Eye of Judgment?

43:26.640 --> 43:27.640
Yes.

43:27.640 --> 43:29.040
Fired!

43:29.040 --> 43:30.040
Have you played it?

43:30.040 --> 43:31.040
No, I haven't.

43:31.040 --> 43:33.800
I saw the tech demo and I was like, why?

43:33.800 --> 43:37.000
We did kind of see it at E3, so I'm curious.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.200
So you're being completely serious.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.200
This game is awesome.

43:40.200 --> 43:44.360
Okay, I won't give it the OLR, I'll give it the STFU, I'll leave that for you guys.

43:44.360 --> 43:46.360
No, no, that's fine, but I'm just curious.

43:46.360 --> 43:47.360
You're absolutely serious.

43:47.360 --> 43:49.000
This game rocked.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.120
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

43:50.120 --> 43:55.880
I'm a huge CCG fan, and I've been, obviously, I'm a huge video games fan, and this was a

43:55.880 --> 43:58.360
very good combination of the two.

43:58.360 --> 44:02.520
It felt more interactive to me than just putting a piece of cardboard on the table.

44:02.520 --> 44:06.720
I could actually see what was going on, and I thought the technology was good and it was

44:06.720 --> 44:12.120
something different, which I'm always welcome to seeing.

44:12.120 --> 44:16.120
The graphics were great, there weren't any glitches with reading the cards.

44:16.120 --> 44:20.640
I had no problem with it, and really, Sony didn't bring much else to the table.

44:20.640 --> 44:21.920
Oh, so I get it.

44:21.920 --> 44:26.520
So you're giving the award to Eye of Judgment by default, because there were no other games

44:26.520 --> 44:27.520
there.

44:27.520 --> 44:28.920
There was nothing new from Sony there.

44:28.920 --> 44:29.920
I see.

44:29.920 --> 44:30.920
It was bad.

44:30.920 --> 44:34.200
But was Eye of Judgment the best thing you saw on any system?

44:34.200 --> 44:36.200
No.

44:36.200 --> 44:42.560
I'll be getting to that, but my Wii award goes to Metroid Prime 3.

44:42.560 --> 44:46.360
This game's amazing, and you need to all pick it up next week.

44:46.360 --> 44:47.360
Why?

44:47.360 --> 44:51.080
One, it has the best Wii remote controls I've ever seen.

44:51.080 --> 44:55.640
The looking is fantastic, the shooting is fantastic, the motion controls are very intuitive

44:55.640 --> 44:57.420
and a lot of fun.

44:57.420 --> 45:01.920
But I didn't like Prime 1 and 2, well, I take that back, I kind of like Prime 2, the multiplayer

45:01.920 --> 45:06.340
mode, but I found first person Metroid so hard to play, am I going to suddenly get over

45:06.340 --> 45:07.440
it with number 3?

45:07.440 --> 45:08.840
Will it bring me back?

45:08.840 --> 45:10.260
I think I will.

45:10.260 --> 45:13.800
The motion controls really make you feel like a part of the game, and some of the boss battles

45:13.800 --> 45:14.800
are amazing.

45:14.800 --> 45:19.000
I got to demo the Ridley boss battle.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.600
I'm not going to spoil too much, but it was one of the coolest boss battles I've ever

45:23.600 --> 45:24.600
fought.

45:24.600 --> 45:25.600
Ever.

45:25.600 --> 45:27.600
Did you get a rise out of it?

45:27.600 --> 45:28.600
Yes, yes I did.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.600
I knocked down there.

45:29.600 --> 45:32.000
Did it make you feel excited in a special place?

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Sometimes.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.680
Did you have to go back to your hotel room and take care of some business after playing

45:36.680 --> 45:37.680
the demo?

45:37.680 --> 45:40.940
No, because I had to go run tournaments, unfortunately.

45:40.940 --> 45:41.940
I see.

45:41.940 --> 45:45.380
Alright, so how about your Xbox 360 award?

45:45.380 --> 45:47.000
And overall award.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Rock Band.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.200
No question.

45:49.200 --> 45:54.160
This game is amazing, and yes, I know everybody in the chat room is like, hey, I played this

45:54.160 --> 45:57.100
before, it's Guitar Freak Stromania.

45:57.100 --> 46:01.360
And you're right, it is Guitar Freak Stromania and Karaoke Revolution, but it's with songs

46:01.360 --> 46:05.500
that the mainstream people are going to know, and that's going to sell a lot of copies and

46:05.500 --> 46:08.000
make harmonics a lot of money.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.640
The interface is great, the controllers are great, the guitars for guitar, excuse me,

46:14.640 --> 46:17.600
Rock Band feel like real guitars.

46:17.600 --> 46:23.960
The fret buttons are colored on the top of the controller, rather, on the buttons themselves.

46:23.960 --> 46:26.240
But it's the same layout as guitar here.

46:26.240 --> 46:29.960
Here's my question for you, do you think if Rock Band does well, there'll be a pop band

46:29.960 --> 46:30.960
that comes out?

46:30.960 --> 46:35.680
Because, you know, I like shitty music, and there's just not a lot, I mean, Rock Band

46:35.680 --> 46:39.160
actually has a lot of good music in it, but I like shitty music, so is there any hope

46:39.160 --> 46:41.720
for me and my love of pop music?

46:41.720 --> 46:45.320
If you would have brought me that question, I would have asked the harmonics guys.

46:45.320 --> 46:46.640
Damn you.

46:46.640 --> 46:51.180
But with them releasing Guitar Hero 80s, anything can happen.

46:51.180 --> 46:55.040
So actually, I honestly wouldn't rule that out if, I mean, a lot of the songs in Guitar

46:55.040 --> 47:02.200
Hero 80s weren't that great, but I think Pop Band could very well be a viable idea.

47:02.200 --> 47:06.720
Going to comments from the chat room here, Zaku says, excuse me sir, but harmonics fucked

47:06.720 --> 47:08.940
up the drums, nuff said.

47:08.940 --> 47:10.600
Have you used them?

47:10.600 --> 47:13.280
Oh wait, you can't respond in time.

47:13.280 --> 47:17.000
No you didn't, they're great, they're very responsive.

47:17.000 --> 47:22.960
My only beef is the Xbox button is in the way of the rightmost two drums, and that got

47:22.960 --> 47:24.880
annoying a couple of times.

47:24.880 --> 47:28.080
Tiger Claw says, Rob, don't give them any ideas, next thing you know there will be a

47:28.080 --> 47:30.640
game called Boy Band.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.520
Miklotov got all excited over there.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.400
I think that's called Sing Star actually.

47:35.400 --> 47:39.080
Yeah, it is probably called Sing Star, that would be so much fun.

47:39.080 --> 47:42.040
You're not getting Rock Band, we all know you're going to get the High School Musical

47:42.040 --> 47:45.080
Sing It game, so just buzz off.

47:45.080 --> 47:50.720
I can't officially name this as a winner, but the finals for the Omega-Thon, if anybody's

47:50.720 --> 47:56.240
not familiar with that, it packs picks a bunch of people who are pre-registered and plays

47:56.240 --> 47:57.400
them at a bunch of video games.

47:57.400 --> 48:03.880
It went from Jenga from the beginning to Halo 3 as the final.

48:03.880 --> 48:08.680
They showed two new maps called, one was called Narrows, which is a hallway with vehicles

48:08.680 --> 48:11.040
and it was a hell of a lot of fun.

48:11.040 --> 48:16.400
The other one was called Guardian, which looked very base-like and showed off jump pads and

48:16.400 --> 48:18.800
elevators and was really cool.

48:18.800 --> 48:24.540
Some new weapons, a flame thrower will be in the game, fire grenades will be in the

48:24.540 --> 48:29.500
game, a Spartan laser will be in the game, and this item called the Gravity Hammer, which

48:29.500 --> 48:31.480
is the sword on steroids.

48:31.480 --> 48:34.120
Huh, wow.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.120
How did Halo 3 look?

48:35.120 --> 48:38.920
Because a lot of people complained the beta didn't look that much better, it looked really

48:38.920 --> 48:39.920
good.

48:39.920 --> 48:40.920
Did it?

48:40.920 --> 48:42.720
It looked really good.

48:42.720 --> 48:45.840
What I was most impressed with is the heads-up display.

48:45.840 --> 48:49.720
It got a big overhaul from Halo 2.

48:49.720 --> 48:55.480
The shield meter is directly top-center on the screen, so you'll be seeing it at all

48:55.480 --> 48:57.840
times.

48:57.840 --> 49:03.160
They have your weapons and ammo in the upper right corner and it has icons and the button

49:03.160 --> 49:06.200
instead of saying, press this button to pick up this now.

49:06.200 --> 49:12.400
They streamlined it a lot and I really, really think this will get rid of the disappointment

49:12.400 --> 49:15.040
that, at least in my opinion, was Halo 2.

49:15.040 --> 49:17.280
Let's see, Gold Banjo says, yay fire.

49:17.280 --> 49:21.000
GS68 though asks, any word on the man cannon?

49:21.000 --> 49:28.720
I did not see a man cannon, but there is a plasma cannon that you could, it was mounted

49:28.720 --> 49:31.920
but you could yank it out and run after people with it, which is pretty cool.

49:31.920 --> 49:32.920
All right.

49:32.920 --> 49:35.560
Well, anything else you want to share from Penny Arcade Expo since you were lucky enough

49:35.560 --> 49:36.560
to go?

49:36.560 --> 49:37.560
Two things.

49:37.560 --> 49:44.920
One, the fragdoll stole a flowchart about boobs that I made and two, Wil Wheaton kicked

49:44.920 --> 49:46.720
my ass at Guitar Hero.

49:46.720 --> 49:49.040
You poor thing.

49:49.040 --> 49:50.040
That was pretty cool.

49:50.040 --> 49:51.040
He's a good sport about it.

49:51.040 --> 49:52.040
Wow.

49:52.040 --> 49:53.200
But that's about it.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.640
Penny Arcade Expo is great.

49:54.640 --> 49:55.880
I wish you guys were there.

49:55.880 --> 49:58.480
Wait, how the hell did you end up playing Guitar Hero with Wil Wheaton?

49:58.480 --> 49:59.480
Was it just by chance?

49:59.480 --> 50:02.760
Well, Matt and he entered the tournament and beforehand he was in there warming up and

50:02.760 --> 50:05.720
asked if I could get a game with him because I'm probably not going to get a chance to

50:05.720 --> 50:06.720
play and he's like, sure.

50:06.720 --> 50:10.600
And we played a Let's Talk More Rock Expert and he kicked my ass.

50:10.600 --> 50:11.600
Wow.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.600
Huh.

50:12.600 --> 50:13.600
Something else.

50:13.600 --> 50:14.600
All right.

50:14.600 --> 50:18.600
Well, Insanus, thank you so much for the call and a real quick plug for your show if you'd

50:18.600 --> 50:19.600
like.

50:19.600 --> 50:25.600
STFU every Thursday at seven followed by the Insanus hour if I'm up to it whenever STFU

50:25.600 --> 50:26.600
is over.

50:26.600 --> 50:27.600
All right.

50:27.600 --> 50:30.960
Good to see that there is some weekday programming still happening on the station on Thursdays

50:30.960 --> 50:35.680
and occasionally on Tuesdays, not so much on Wednesdays.

50:35.680 --> 50:39.680
And if I have any spare swag left over, I will either be giving it to you guys or away

50:39.680 --> 50:40.680
to listeners.

50:40.680 --> 50:41.680
Hoorah.

50:41.680 --> 50:42.680
More on that on Thursday.

50:42.680 --> 50:43.680
All right.

50:43.680 --> 50:47.320
Well, I was just going to say, speaking of Tuesday, I will be live this week.

50:47.320 --> 50:48.320
Hooray.

50:48.320 --> 50:49.320
Yay.

50:49.320 --> 50:50.320
I have something to do on Tuesday.

50:50.320 --> 50:52.320
But I won't be here on next Sunday.

50:52.320 --> 50:55.620
But I will not be here on Wednesday because I'm in LA for four days.

50:55.620 --> 50:58.840
I won't be here next Sunday because of something very special.

50:58.840 --> 50:59.840
And that would be-

50:59.840 --> 51:02.520
I have one more request because you haven't done it tomorrow.

51:02.520 --> 51:04.920
Well, let Jamie finish your thought and then you can have your turn.

51:04.920 --> 51:05.920
Yes, Jamie.

51:05.920 --> 51:06.920
Okay.

51:06.920 --> 51:07.920
It's the weekend of my second wedding anniversary.

51:07.920 --> 51:08.920
Well, congratulations.

51:08.920 --> 51:09.920
Yay, Jamie.

51:09.920 --> 51:15.440
So I will be making Dan buy me expensive food on Saturday and he's taking me to Weird Al

51:15.440 --> 51:16.440
on Sunday.

51:16.440 --> 51:17.440
All right.

51:17.440 --> 51:21.160
It should be an interesting show Sunday because Labor Day weekend and everything.

51:21.160 --> 51:22.160
So we'll see.

51:22.160 --> 51:23.160
We'll still be tracking you.

51:23.160 --> 51:25.160
I'll be here if we do a drunk show.

51:25.160 --> 51:26.160
Hmm.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.160
Hmm.

51:27.160 --> 51:31.160
Maybe, you know, I don't have any plans for Monday.

51:31.160 --> 51:32.160
Hmm.

51:32.160 --> 51:33.160
The plot thickens.

51:33.160 --> 51:34.160
All right, DMN.

51:34.160 --> 51:36.440
What was your one more thought?

51:36.440 --> 51:38.320
You haven't hung up on me in a while.

51:38.320 --> 51:39.320
You're right.

51:39.320 --> 51:40.320
So I should do that now.

51:40.320 --> 51:41.320
All right.

51:41.320 --> 51:47.240
If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

51:47.240 --> 51:49.320
We'll take one more call.

51:49.320 --> 51:50.320
Yeah.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.320
DMN goes by Insanus now.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.320
I don't know why.

51:53.320 --> 51:54.400
Why did Prince change his name?

51:54.400 --> 51:55.400
He just did.

51:55.400 --> 51:58.680
No, he did because his name was copyrighted by the label he was on before.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.800
Do you always have to know everything?

52:00.800 --> 52:01.800
Yes.

52:01.800 --> 52:08.760
To DMN slash Insanus slash whatever your name's going to be tomorrow, if you don't sign on

52:08.760 --> 52:12.160
to WoW, I'm going to get somebody to kick you out of the guild because you're being

52:12.160 --> 52:13.760
too inactive.

52:13.760 --> 52:14.760
And I don't like that.

52:14.760 --> 52:15.760
Thank you.

52:15.760 --> 52:16.760
All right.

52:16.760 --> 52:19.220
Well, I'd like to go to another call now.

52:19.220 --> 52:23.160
You can use your WoW guild chat some other time, Miklotov, okay?

52:23.160 --> 52:26.400
Wait, you can't kick him from the guild because you don't have WoW.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.280
You had to cancel WoW.

52:28.280 --> 52:29.280
All right.

52:29.280 --> 52:30.280
We got to go back to the phones.

52:30.280 --> 52:31.280
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.280
Who's this?

52:32.280 --> 52:33.280
Hey, it's AZHP.

52:33.280 --> 52:34.280
Hello, AZHP.

52:34.280 --> 52:38.080
Sorry to make you listen to our bickering.

52:38.080 --> 52:43.000
As SSJ100Matt says in the chat, oh no, guild drama.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.600
Although I should say, if you want to join the OL Army Guild, which is actually called

52:47.600 --> 52:53.080
Order of Valtiel, it's on the Ravencrest server horde side, and it's fun, lots of fun.

52:53.080 --> 52:55.520
I don't know why you say it's an OrangeLounge Guild.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.880
It's my guild.

52:56.880 --> 52:58.520
It's more Silent Hill than anything.

52:58.520 --> 53:02.520
Because it's the one I play on, and you play on it, and some of the other people that have

53:02.520 --> 53:04.320
been on the show in the past play on it.

53:04.320 --> 53:08.520
Plus, if it was not an OLR Guild, we wouldn't have gotten some of our great players, like

53:08.520 --> 53:13.280
Eddie is on there, and Aliestor or whatever plays it.

53:13.280 --> 53:16.120
Two people.

53:16.120 --> 53:19.660
And then a bunch of people will join and level their characters to five, and then we never

53:19.660 --> 53:20.800
see them again.

53:20.800 --> 53:24.480
So we've had like two or three that have stuck with it, but that's about it.

53:24.480 --> 53:27.840
I'm there, but I just don't play that much.

53:27.840 --> 53:30.240
Speaking of people who leveled to level five and then quit.

53:30.240 --> 53:33.680
No, I will add to eight with my team, and then I started...

53:33.680 --> 53:34.680
Oh, sorry, eight.

53:34.680 --> 53:35.840
Okay, okay, okay.

53:35.840 --> 53:40.840
I will play World of Warcraft on some day.

53:40.840 --> 53:42.760
And DMN sent me a private message.

53:42.760 --> 53:45.520
Tell me, Glattov, I quit WoW.

53:45.520 --> 53:46.920
Then I'm sad.

53:46.920 --> 53:51.560
All right, anyway, sorry AZHP has been waiting on the line very patiently, you poor bastard.

53:51.560 --> 53:54.040
What's on your mind?

53:54.040 --> 53:58.680
Speaking of WoW, after I got off the phone last week with you guys, you said that I might

53:58.680 --> 54:03.200
have bought this budget computer for WoW, and no, I'm not a WoW player.

54:03.200 --> 54:04.200
Really?

54:04.200 --> 54:08.880
Oh, because that's right, you emailed us, and we said something about you had the budget...

54:08.880 --> 54:10.920
You said something about buying a budget computer, right?

54:10.920 --> 54:15.040
Yeah, well, I Skyped in last week, and I said that I bought a budget computer, and you thought

54:15.040 --> 54:20.920
that it was for WoW, and no, I've seen what WoW does to my friends, and I don't want to

54:20.920 --> 54:22.840
become a recovering WoW addict.

54:22.840 --> 54:25.640
Ironic that we're yelling about WoW the minute you call in.

54:25.640 --> 54:27.680
That's why you were snickering to yourself.

54:27.680 --> 54:29.560
Is that all you wanted to say?

54:29.560 --> 54:34.920
No, well, I didn't catch the mailbag this week.

54:34.920 --> 54:36.480
You guys read my email?

54:36.480 --> 54:38.800
I don't know, maybe.

54:38.800 --> 54:41.680
We read a lot of emails, so I don't know if we...

54:41.680 --> 54:43.280
I think I heard your name come up.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.520
All right, awesome.

54:44.520 --> 54:45.520
Well, yeah.

54:45.520 --> 54:49.480
You know, you could always just download part A, and then you'll find out.

54:49.480 --> 54:56.080
Well, yeah, I played the Bioshock demo, and I was looking at picking it up, because it's

54:56.080 --> 54:57.080
so awesome, right?

54:57.080 --> 54:59.240
Oh, yeah, we read this email, yeah.

54:59.240 --> 55:04.720
Yeah, and I just read a lot of controversy on the forums, like, oh, if you buy the game,

55:04.720 --> 55:10.960
you can only register it on two computers, and after that, your CD won't work anymore

55:10.960 --> 55:13.400
on any other computers that you have.

55:13.400 --> 55:17.480
That and your computer will be reported to the Motion Picture Association of America.

55:17.480 --> 55:21.440
Why they do that, I don't know, but it's just more negative stuff to happen.

55:21.440 --> 55:26.360
And little gnomes will come live inside your computer, and if you don't feed them before

55:26.360 --> 55:28.600
midnight, then your computer will grow legs and walk away.

55:28.600 --> 55:31.960
I mean, the coffee protection on Bioshock is just that bad.

55:31.960 --> 55:37.660
Yeah, actually, people have said that rootkits were installed, like the Sony's old rootkits

55:37.660 --> 55:43.000
that pretty much just monitored everything on your computer, so I'm thinking of waiting

55:43.000 --> 55:49.320
until that stuff gets all settled down, people start throwing lawsuits at 2K and stuff, more

55:49.320 --> 55:50.320
lawsuits.

55:50.320 --> 55:54.420
Yes, and actually, Big Brother is watching your computer and sending daily reports to

55:54.420 --> 55:57.160
Amber who's crying about them right now.

55:57.160 --> 55:58.160
Bad joke, sorry.

55:58.160 --> 56:00.040
If you get that, you need a life like I do.

56:00.040 --> 56:03.400
See, Miklotov's booing me, I know he needs it, all right.

56:03.400 --> 56:06.520
Anything else you want to share, ACHP?

56:06.520 --> 56:11.440
Probably, but it all got lost in the randomness, so I guess that's about it.

56:11.440 --> 56:15.600
That's like the tagline of this show, it all gets lost in the randomness, so there you

56:15.600 --> 56:16.600
go.

56:16.600 --> 56:17.600
That is pretty excellent.

56:17.600 --> 56:19.880
Oh, actually, one more thing.

56:19.880 --> 56:20.880
Yes.

56:20.880 --> 56:26.200
Yeah, about the Wii outselling the Xbox 360, and you guys are all wondering, oh, it's not

56:26.200 --> 56:30.400
the hardcore gamers who's buying all the stuff for it, it's just Wii Sports, Wii Play.

56:30.400 --> 56:31.480
Well, it's a mix.

56:31.480 --> 56:32.480
It's a mix.

56:32.480 --> 56:33.480
Yeah.

56:33.480 --> 56:35.360
I mean, keep in mind we were reading some chat comments there, too.

56:35.360 --> 56:36.360
I think it's a mix.

56:36.360 --> 56:40.040
I think you've got both the hardcore gamers and soccer moms buying it, and that's why

56:40.040 --> 56:45.440
it's doing so well, but I think for a lot of hardcore gamers, the magic is dying off,

56:45.440 --> 56:49.280
you know, and hopefully, Metroid is going to bring that back, and Super Smash Brothers

56:49.280 --> 56:54.840
certainly will bring that back, but, you know, I feel like it's the DS launch all over again,

56:54.840 --> 56:55.840
really.

56:55.840 --> 56:56.840
It's the DS launch all over again.

56:56.840 --> 57:00.540
You had a bunch of great games at the beginning, and then, like, a year of deadness with the

57:00.540 --> 57:03.960
occasional gem, and now we're going to get back into overdrive.

57:03.960 --> 57:09.120
Yeah, I mean, like, from next week until four months from now, we've got, like, great releases

57:09.120 --> 57:10.480
coming every month.

57:10.480 --> 57:14.940
You got Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Brothers.

57:14.940 --> 57:16.960
You got Battalion Wars.

57:16.960 --> 57:18.920
Everything's just, like, coming out one after another.

57:18.920 --> 57:21.080
Well, it's about freaking time, right?

57:21.080 --> 57:22.080
Yeah, definitely.

57:22.080 --> 57:23.080
All right.

57:23.080 --> 57:24.080
All right.

57:24.080 --> 57:25.080
I haven't touched...

57:25.080 --> 57:26.880
I haven't bought a new game for my Wii since Ellipitz.

57:26.880 --> 57:30.640
I mean, the last one I bought was Super Paper Mario, and I barely played it.

57:30.640 --> 57:34.080
I feel like a dummy for even buying it, because I barely played it, but...

57:34.080 --> 57:35.080
Oh, well.

57:35.080 --> 57:36.080
All right.

57:36.080 --> 57:37.080
Well, AZHP, thanks so much for the call.

57:37.080 --> 57:38.640
We've got to go and wrap things up, okay?

57:38.640 --> 57:39.640
All right, then.

57:39.640 --> 57:40.640
All right.

57:40.640 --> 57:41.640
Later, sir.

57:41.640 --> 57:42.640
Bye.

57:42.640 --> 57:43.640
All right.

57:43.640 --> 57:44.640
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

57:44.640 --> 57:45.760
If you didn't get through, so sorry, but try again next week.

57:45.760 --> 57:49.840
We had some long calls tonight that kind of took up all our time, so if you're mad we

57:49.840 --> 57:53.440
didn't get to your call, just blame Insanus, because his call went on for about nine minutes.

57:53.440 --> 57:54.440
All right.

57:54.440 --> 57:55.440
Just kidding.

57:55.440 --> 57:59.480
Let's get to the listless results, shall we, before we get to the last-minute stories,

57:59.480 --> 58:02.160
because you still had some last-minute stories, right, Loki?

58:02.160 --> 58:03.160
Yes.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.280
Maybe Dark Sakura has a few as well?

58:05.280 --> 58:06.280
Yeah, no.

58:06.280 --> 58:07.280
All right.

58:07.280 --> 58:08.280
Yeah, no.

58:08.280 --> 58:09.480
All right.

58:09.480 --> 58:11.200
Let's get to tonight's listless results.

58:11.200 --> 58:16.240
In third place for the character we would most like to see in the new track and field

58:16.240 --> 58:22.480
game, Dracula is the character that people would like to see third most in their DDR

58:22.480 --> 58:23.480
game.

58:23.480 --> 58:30.320
In second place for a character that we most want to see in track and field, Mr. Spanky

58:30.320 --> 58:36.640
comes in second place, and what could possibly top Mr. Spanky for the number one character

58:36.640 --> 58:40.720
you most want to see in track and field on the DS?

58:40.720 --> 58:44.160
The left DDR arrow is the number one.

58:44.160 --> 58:45.160
Yay.

58:45.160 --> 58:48.240
So make it happen, Konami.

58:48.240 --> 58:49.560
That's the first time I've ever won.

58:49.560 --> 58:50.560
I'm so excited.

58:50.560 --> 58:52.840
How many listless games have you played with us?

58:52.840 --> 58:54.840
Like ten, probably.

58:54.840 --> 58:56.960
Well, congratulations.

58:56.960 --> 59:00.280
Poor Loki in Dark Sakura got X'd out that round.

59:00.280 --> 59:01.280
I'm sorry.

59:01.280 --> 59:02.280
Kids?

59:02.280 --> 59:03.280
Oh, well.

59:03.280 --> 59:05.880
That's okay, because of several times I've won the entire thing by myself.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.920
Well, of several times.

59:07.920 --> 59:08.920
Shut up.

59:08.920 --> 59:11.680
Why are you being mean to me?

59:11.680 --> 59:13.280
Because you let me.

59:13.280 --> 59:14.520
Heart.

59:14.520 --> 59:16.160
Hearts make it better.

59:16.160 --> 59:17.720
Don't throw napkins at me.

59:17.720 --> 59:18.720
That will just make me meaner.

59:18.720 --> 59:20.000
Yes, make it tough.

59:20.000 --> 59:24.960
I realized like ten minutes ago that it would have been better to do the right DDR arrow

59:24.960 --> 59:28.480
because it's pointing in the direction of like the running on the screen.

59:28.480 --> 59:31.480
The left DDR arrow makes even less sense now that I think about it.

59:31.480 --> 59:32.760
It makes you run away.

59:32.760 --> 59:34.320
But it makes it funnier.

59:34.320 --> 59:40.160
Anyway, Loki, last minute stories.

59:40.160 --> 59:47.240
So there was some other stuff other than the Eye of Judgment announced for the PlayStation

59:47.240 --> 59:48.720
Eye.

59:48.720 --> 59:54.120
One of which is the Towers of Topac, which is apparently a game where you roll around

59:54.120 --> 59:57.960
this giant ball down this tower using your body.

59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.560
Sounds like a shitload of fun.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.560
Hurrah.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:06.880
I will use the Eye of Judgment to roll a giant ball down a hill is what you're saying.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.880
Something like that.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.400
That sounds like totem ball.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.780
I love totem ball.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.880
It's not exactly a totem ball.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:19.040
Basically it's a top down view and each of the little platforms that you're on is actually

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.920
an image of your screen.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.560
So you actually are on multiple little platforms there.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.560
I don't know.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.560
It's weird.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.120
Not something I would buy though.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.120
Let's see here.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:39.080
Also, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, which is rumored to be out this year, according to an interview

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:45.760
with some people working the Sony booth at Lipsig, that actually I guess with the series

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:54.240
creator Kazunori Yamauchi has confirmed himself.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:59.800
He said that yes, it will be a free download on the PSN and we're thinking of charging,

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.800
but doubt it.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.640
For now it's free.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.520
So I think it was actually supposed to contain quite a bit of stuff.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:13.440
They were saying, I want to say it was like quite a few cars and about 16 tracks or something

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.440
like that.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.020
I think it was like 50 cars.

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:19.000
So that would be pretty sweet if it was free.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.520
Then I wouldn't have to buy the actual game.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.040
Anyways, let's see.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:32.380
Other than that, there was one other thing I was going to say that they've partially

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:37.000
cracked the Xbox 360 kernel.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.520
Now that allows you to download or downgrade from any kernel without using a computer key

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.520
is possible.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:52.680
So what that'll allow you to do is drop your firmware down to a level where you can put

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.760
homebrew stuff on it.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.360
Not fully functional, but getting close.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.680
All right.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.040
Is that it?

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.040
That's it.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.040
All right.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.440
Lots of last minute stories tonight.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.200
Well, that's about it for the show tonight.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.960
Thank you guys so much for tuning into us and listening to us tonight.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.320
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.840
Miklotov, thank you for being here.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.840
I didn't have a choice.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:19.040
Are you going to be here next week for our maybe drunk show?

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.000
I don't think I have a choice.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.440
Well, I'm glad you have such enthusiasm with this program.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.080
Maybe I'll lift my ban on drinking for myself.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.800
That would be fun.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.080
I think we might have to do a drunk show after all.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.560
So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.080
Miklotov, your final thought.

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.680
I don't know.

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:42.840
Loki, your final thought.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:49.100
My final thought is they had some people, I guess, at Leipzig that were just completely

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:51.900
naked except they were painted on.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.200
That's what we need to see at E3.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.200
Painted chicks.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.020
They're topless.

01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:02.240
My final thought is Mike and Ike's are yummy and I just found one left in the bag.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.960
Delicious.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.480
Dark Soccer, your final thought.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.480
Gross.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.480
You don't like Mike and Ike's?

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:12.360
They're one of the candies I can't eat because I'm allergic to one of the ingredients.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.600
It's like a gelatin something.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:18.680
Same with Starburst and gum makes me nauseous when I smell it.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.080
I'm trying to figure out what the name of the ingredient would be.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.760
It's something like Jamie Repellent.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760
Jamie Repellent.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.760
Oh, look.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.760
It's right in there.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.760
Jamie Repellent number five.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.760
Who knew?

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.760
All right.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.680
Of course, thanks you guys so much for tuning in to and downloading our show or tuning in

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:34.680
live.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.680
We appreciate it.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.000
Remember, if you like what we do here, please, or even if you don't like what we do here,

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.560
please help us spread the word of independent radio nonetheless.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.880
Tell two people about your show.
