16435	26717	New Castlevania games are being made for an unlikely platform, Sony confirms a video recorder for the PlayStation 3, and a much anticipated 360 game gets pushed back to December.
31775	36039	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36119	41503	We are that video game podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41543	42725	My name is Rob Roberts.
42825	45827	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
46127	47389	My head is numb.
47669	49390	Who doesn't have a microphone on tonight.
49771	50431	I do now.
50491	50952	There you go.
50992	51552	How are you doing?
51572	53354	Hey, I have a head injury, so leave me alone.
53454	53934	I'm sorry to hear.
53954	54755	What happened to your head?
55333	59516	I was getting out of the car and then I was getting back into the car and my foot slipped out from under me.
59736	60036	I see.
60476	64059	On the gravel outside and I hit my head on the top of my Lancer.
64539	65300	Aw, sorry to hear it.
65740	67701	Metal hurts when it hits you in the head.
68081	68342	Yes.
68842	75887	It was like one moment I'm upright, the next moment I actually have my head laying on the seat of the driver's side of my car.
76627	80329	Do you think that the great people up in the sky were trying to tell you something?
80369	81470	I have a concussion, Rob.
81971	82491	Sorry to hear it.
82793	85715	Well, this should make for a riveting tonight's show, so we'll see.
86235	88757	Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
89117	89417	Hello.
89897	90238	Hi, Loki.
90278	90718	How are you doing?
90978	91338	Doing good.
91658	91959	Excellent.
92399	92659	All right.
93259	98182	Well, let's get into how we like to start the show off always with a little bit of how is your gaming week.
98823	105687	If you want to join along and participate in the program, though, head on over to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and you can participate in tonight's program.
106471	107492	Meanwhile, let's start it off.
107532	109333	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
109633	112896	I played a bunch of Final Fantasy VI in the car and then didn't save it.
112916	114897	That's not good.
114917	116118	On a Game Boy Micro.
116859	119160	I was extra motion sick for the entire time.
119220	120081	It was fantastic.
120802	126886	And then I got like 2 billion on World Cup Soccer the other day.
127166	127687	I was pretty happy.
127807	128187	Pinball?
128527	129188	Yes, pinball.
129208	129428	Pinball fun?
129932	131953	Well, I either just take up space.
131993	133094	I have no choice but to play them.
133434	135755	What's more fun, pinball or Final Fantasy?
136075	136516	Pinball.
137236	137876	I just curious.
137896	139977	Final Fantasy pinball, if that existed.
139997	140998	Dude, that would be beautiful.
141058	142259	They should make a Final Fantasy pinball.
142439	145681	But pinball is instant gratification because it goes banging.
145921	146661	It makes noises.
147562	148842	It's banging.
149363	153685	Dan took the glass off of our Twilight Zone, so I put the camera in and took pictures from inside the machine.
154366	155686	You know what else would be cool with pinball machines?
155746	157807	A laser light show, if they could do that, too.
158247	159307	Tonight's show is very broken.
159347	160308	I'll explain why in a minute.
160608	162508	I'm trying to multitask in a lot of different ways.
163168	166009	Anything else you want to share with your gaming week, DarkSakura?
167190	168290	I don't like concussions.
169010	170291	They should make concussion the game.
171431	172511	How exactly does that work?
172651	175012	You just go around hitting people in the head.
175552	180013	And the worse of a head injury you give them without killing them, the better you score.
180033	182434	Alright, well, let's...
184676	185197	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
194929	196430	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
219482	221643	What happened was... You just want to see what happens when you kill little girls.
221923	228585	What happened was that I was unable to get an achievement, so I need to restart the game, so now I'm doing that again.
229505	232506	I love how you'll go back and play the whole game over just because you missed an achievement.
232967	233467	Oh, hell yeah.
233547	240409	Well, I'm trying to... I don't want to have to play the whole game over again, and I wasn't that far to begin with, so now I'm just going back and doing what I did.
241329	243430	And then, of course, I played...
245037	249080	The Silent Hill Origins demo that magically got leaked out there.
249561	259689	So I played that on the PSP, and I gotta say, man, between what we saw originally at the Konami BBQ to what it is now, completely different game.
259729	261831	I mean, this game looks friggin' awesome.
261891	266635	It's just, I don't know, it looks actually better than some of the PlayStation 2 versions.
266735	270278	So, definitely one to pick up on the PSP.
271810	275794	And let's see, other than that, I actually played a little bit of Saints Row.
275814	278597	We finally got our entire game room up at work.
279177	282941	And we did a five-player Saints Row deathmatch on that.
282961	284683	And it looks sweet, the setup we have.
284723	286244	And hopefully I'll have some pictures soon.
286605	288887	What exactly does your game room at work consist of?
289027	292210	The game room at work consists of five Xbox 360s.
294144	319180	and there's LCD monitors for each one of those and then four of those are tied in to a 37 inch LCD TV that we have mounted to the wall so if you really wanted to you can actually tune in on the TV four different monitors and see what other people are you know their perspective so if someone's watching us play they don't have to look over our shoulders they can actually dial it in and see what other people are doing.
320359	348034	or you can just play it on the TV if you're only doing one person on there or something so other cool things we talked about doing with that is actually like Project Gotham Racing where you could do four people actually racing each other and then the fifth one would be on the big screen and that would be kind of one of the spectator mode options there so that way everyone's racing and you see kind of a racetrack view of the whole game so that would be pretty slick
348723	356612	But it's basically for the event that we've got coming this coming week with our publishers coming out and stuff.
356772	363160	And also, really it's for Grand Theft Auto 4 because we're that obsessed with Grand Theft Auto.
364161	366624	Too bad you got all that set up and now you're going to have to wait until next year though.
367435	367815	That's okay.
368155	378741	We've got Saints Row in the meantime, and we're going to beg the publishers to give us copies, multiple copies of upcoming games that would possibly be something we'd want to play.
379101	382963	All right, well, let me get some comments here from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
382983	388326	I'm looking at Ross Steel UT says, Not killing any of the Little Sisters is how you get the best ending, too.
389827	392368	And then Undead Zerglings asks, Achievement Whore?
393484	394625	Yes, Loki is an achievement whore.
394905	397667	He will buy games just to get the achievement points out of them.
398948	399568	Not necessarily.
399608	400709	I don't really do that anymore.
401009	401729	I used to, though.
402650	406432	I will play games that are crappy for achievement sometimes.
406652	411616	Out of the last few Xbox Live Arcade releases, how many would you say you bought strictly to get the achievement points out of them?
413217	417199	None of the recent ones, because I've got a little bit smarter on that.
417680	418880	But let's see.
419040	422923	Previous ones that I bought for achievement, Pac-Man, Frogger.
423828	426210	Um, shit, what else did I buy?
426230	430934	Um, I don't know, there's quite a few games that I bought on kind of like an impulse buy.
431975	438120	Luckily now I've gotten it where I don't buy games, you know, straight outright, I will play the demo first.
439482	440302	Except for Catan.
440402	445827	Catan I had to download the full thing, but I knew what that was, you know, before I played it, so.
446547	450571	But, uh, yeah, now I strictly, I play the demos first, and...
451708	453152	Then if I like it, I'll buy it.
453613	457424	SSJ100 Matt in our chat says, so Loki is more of a high-priced whore now.
458166	458727	Exactly.
460227	462389	My gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
462529	469493	I, unlike most of America, did not run out and buy Bioshock right away because I'm kind of holding out to see if some used copies or a price cut shows up.
469533	470413	Plus, I'm going to be in L.A.
470433	471154	most of next week.
471354	474756	I would say, well, locally, you can buy it at Fry's for $49.99.
475396	475697	Really?
475977	478198	See, that's what I'm holding out for, some deals like that.
478238	480800	I heard Circuit City was doing some type of sale, too.
480840	482140	That's the other thing, too, I was going to say.
482301	487264	I bought the limited edition, and I'm sure everyone read on the Internet that they've had some problems with the...
488516	489277	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
517383	518323	Well, I don't know what it is.
518364	519344	Let me check my email.
520745	521725	Finally, they got it for me.
522246	525727	But, you know, to be honest, I opened the thing up, took some superglue to it.
526108	527228	You can't even tell it broke.
527348	528649	So, I don't care.
528689	529909	I don't want the fucking art book.
530310	531430	You can download it for free.
531470	532331	I don't need that thing.
533411	540555	But the other thing about the limited edition, if you are, you know, I don't know if you can still buy them now, but if you were thinking about buying one, let me put it this way.
540595	544237	The remix CD that they have on there with three tracks, they're remixed by Moby.
544898	546258	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
575803	577805	But the game's awesome, though, so it doesn't matter.
578566	579767	I just wanted the figurine for my desk.
580348	582330	Didn't give a shit about the extra CD.
584092	585534	Alright, well, let's see.
585634	586795	What did I do for My Gaming Week?
587055	587656	My Gaming Week...
588798	591560	Oh gosh, I didn't do a whole lot of new stuff.
592320	596363	I did play some of the new offerings on Xbox Live Arcade, like Space Giraffe.
596523	600926	Space Giraffe is interesting because it tries to assert itself that it's not Tempest, although it kind of is Tempest to me.
601266	603228	But here's the thing, and I love Tempest.
603248	605249	Tempest 2000 is one of my favorite games of all times.
605769	606770	Thanks for watching!
630206	630967	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
656178	656678	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
677779	687842	It's gonna benefit you in some way and then just unfortunately the AI just really pisses you off and you're just like, fuck it, I'm gonna kill you all now.
688403	694965	And then you realize, hey, helping them out actually didn't do anything for me so I'm just gonna kill them all.
697475	697755	All right.
698755	699896	That's pretty much it for my game of the week.
699916	700976	I don't have a lot else to share.
701096	703376	So what else do we get into now?
703416	705017	I guess we can move on to some housekeeping.
705577	706497	So housekeeping.
706957	720740	First off, we are going to be incorporating video into the show real soon, and that's why you've heard me kind of messing around a little bit during the pre-show there, and I am somewhat distracted because on the laptop I'm playing with this site we're going to be using to stream our video, Operator11.com.
722140	729664	which if you guys are familiar with All Games, All Games Interactive, it's the website they use and they've been encouraging some of the other shows and networks to start using it.
730044	735707	Although I do want to make clear, we're not turning into a TV show and we're not going to be using video too heavily.
735987	740049	We just want you guys to be able to see us as we broadcast the show if you want.
740629	741970	I don't know why people would want to see that.
742050	746732	We're not going to be using the... You can call us with your webcam and all that stuff?
747448	747968	Play porn?
748008	753549	That, um, hey, playing porn on the webcam, that was something that we did back at the old apartment.
753649	758250	So, a couple studios ago, when we used to play Gal's Panic over the webcam.
758630	760711	Yeah, no, we're not going to be turning into a TV show suddenly.
760731	762011	It's just like a little something extra.
762351	766312	And the funny thing is, I was streaming the first part of the show, but this is how fickle it is and how broken it is.
766352	770652	I was actually streaming the first few moments of the show, and then I accidentally clicked the wrong link, and now it's gone.
770952	773713	Like, I accidentally, like, refreshed the page and screwed everything up.
774113	776397	So I'm going to have to start over again later or something.
776477	776817	I don't know.
777118	778600	So I'm still trying to get used to this program.
778640	780382	So maybe we'll stream Part B. I don't know.
780723	781544	But it's off now.
781664	782245	It was going.
782625	786631	But in the channel, there's some video of me playing Super Metroid earlier, but the audio is all screwed up.
786731	787993	I really don't encourage you to visit it.
788414	789115	It's not worth your time.
790276	790937	We're trying, though.
790957	799323	We've heard a lot of folks, especially the folks that listen to us live on Sunday night, want to see video, so we're trying to add that into the show, but we're not going to go TV all of a sudden.
799503	801084	Why would you want to see video?
801104	801544	I don't know.
801564	802124	We don't do anything.
802144	803205	We don't really do anything.
803325	804386	I don't know what they think this is.
804986	813292	Are they under the impression that there's an actual lounge in here, that we're all kicking back with martinis or something, you know, just shooting the shit?
813332	816154	I mean, we're just sitting in a small room.
816909	825074	I think it has potential maybe later on if we want to shoot video at whatever tournaments we end up at or shows we end up at.
825114	827875	We can put that in the show and interviews we do as well.
828335	832638	And then the video users can see video, but the audio users don't have anything taken away from them.
832658	833118	You know what I mean?
833418	835839	So I just want to see how we can enhance with video.
836280	837620	But that's a long time coming.
837640	837960	We'll see.
838241	841122	If you have ideas, email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
841462	846145	And I, of course, will be talking to some of the folks that already use Op11 and see what they think.
846325	847325	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
869232	870773	Anyways, no, gaming news.
870933	873233	So this week, a little interesting.
873253	879116	We're going to start things off, of course, talking about a very interesting development out of Leipzig.
879736	883797	And that would be the new Track and Field game on the DS.
884397	887559	It's, I guess, the 25th anniversary of Track and Field.
887599	891500	And as you remember last week, I could care less about the Xbox Live Arcade game.
891980	896282	But now there's the new international Track and Field game, which is going to feature...
898156	899617	20 different athletic events.
900357	911701	And I guess there was going to be some unlockable Konami characters to play, including they've got Sparkster from Rocket Knight Adventures and Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2.
912902	916583	Which, to be honest, I think Pyramid Head would win because he'd just butcher everybody else.
916683	926307	But, you know, I wonder if raping people is one of the events in there because... He only rapes monsters.
927130	929812	Pyramid Head being in the game is all kinds of awesome, though, you have to admit.
929872	930512	That's pretty rad.
932254	938979	Anyway, later in the program during Part B, we'll be talking about characters we would like to see in this track and field game in a segment we call Listless.
939399	941060	We'll get into that a little later in the program.
942121	945523	They didn't say anything else about the events or any additional, like, how the game will play?
945783	947084	Is it going to be button mashing again?
947124	947745	That's what I want to know.
948806	952028	Well, I'm assuming since it's on the DS, it's probably going to have something to do with the stylists.
953308	961311	But they didn't really say anything other than there will be four player matches via, they said locally or via Wi-Fi.
961571	965652	I'm assuming, you know, Wi-Fi ad hoc and Wi-Fi info structure.
966632	972574	Downloadable content and online rankings, leaderboards and detailed player profiles.
972715	975535	So that's kind of cool that they're going to do leaderboards and that kind of thing.
976776	979957	And I guess a ticker to include like a news feed.
980615	985978	It says promise to update anyone playing online whenever a world record is broken.
986258	986619	Oh, great.
986659	988760	So playing the new track and field is going to be like watching CNN.
988780	991642	You're going to have to try and watch what's going on in this box.
991682	993182	And you've got the ticker down here.
993523	995164	And then you've got the stock report over here.
995244	997825	Or, I'm sorry, the people that are online over here.
998826	1000507	How do they cram all that on a DS screen?
1000547	1001227	It looks cool.
1001387	1005330	I'm surprised they didn't do like a Wii version to go along with that, you know.
1005650	1005890	All right.
1006677	1009658	Looking at chat here and what's going on there.
1011578	1016100	Your nickname says, Memo to Konami, use the fucking DDR pad for track and field.
1017340	1020201	Undead Zergling says, I think Pyramid Head only rapes dolls.
1021621	1023182	No, he rapes the nurses too.
1023482	1026202	Escapist says, just what the world needed, more track and field.
1026923	1029243	NintendoManiac64 said, Pyramid Head's in track and field?
1029303	1029683	Dude!
1030624	1034265	And then going back to the webcam chat we had just before the show started there.
1034645	1035225	Let's see, we had...
1038050	1042153	Jaded says, I think it would be funny seeing Loki kick everyone's ass during one of his fits about Max.
1042633	1046875	Kropotkin says, I mean, seeing people's faces stresses what people are thinking and saying.
1047856	1050117	Dark Knight says, remember Rob did TV before.
1050137	1051177	That was like 10 years ago.
1051557	1052518	I wouldn't even count that.
1053078	1053939	I'm an old man now.
1055139	1057200	My young, fresh television face is long gone.
1057761	1058221	All right, let's...
1059065	1060065	And now it's kind of moldy.
1078337	1080319	Cover art for the track and field game.
1080799	1085724	So you can actually check out their DeviantArt page for some of the work they did on it.
1086124	1087986	And some of those Chibi characters were really cute.
1088046	1089667	Like Chibi Pyramid Head is still a winner.
1090428	1091689	I do have to agree with Shane, though.
1091789	1094952	They used the movie Pea Hittie.
1095812	1098014	They didn't use the Pea Hittie that you love and adore?
1098254	1100236	No, not the one with the unwieldy gigantic head.
1100817	1101237	Sorry to hear it.
1102264	1103024	Final Fantasy IV Final Fantasy III
1128789	1130370	DSFanboy.com Have you heard anything about a release in the U.S.
1130390	1130671	for this, Loki?
1156736	1158518	No, the next two games come out here.
1159199	1171391	There's Final Fantasy Tactics The Lion War, Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings, Front Mission DS, and Dragon Quest Monsters Joker.
1173533	1176516	This will probably be, if anything, in the spring maybe.
1177598	1177858	We'll see.
1178786	1184867	Well, that's all I have to say on Final Fantasy IV, but it is one of my favorite Final Fantasy games, so I'm very excited to see what they pull off.
1184887	1186427	Wake me up when they bring out VI.
1186787	1187528	Rob, are you spoony?
1187568	1188328	It's a possibility.
1188808	1189688	You're a spoony bard.
1189988	1190628	I'll have you know.
1191088	1191428	No.
1192509	1199750	Well, for anyone who's into mobile gaming, there is an offering for the mobile phone.
1199870	1205551	It's Castlevania Order of Shadows that they're saying is a collaboration with Igarashi.
1206240	1206820	Tyrone Rodriguez
1235098	1239661	It's supposed to be released on September 18th, so if you really care, then have fun.
1241122	1248707	I was looking at some of the pictures of it, and, well, I don't know.
1248767	1249868	It's a cell phone game.
1249928	1250829	How great can it be?
1252003	1252724	I'll tell you what, though.
1252744	1254485	It has the skull thingies.
1254765	1257327	There's some pretty powerful stuff on cell phones right now.
1257347	1258668	Will they be jeweled?
1258988	1262091	Well, not like that, but not necessarily game-wise, but application-wise.
1262251	1266214	You know how you can download Gmail and actually run that as an application on your phone?
1266774	1270017	Your phone has to be kind of made in the past couple years, and it runs Java-based things.
1270337	1277502	But now they have an Opera Mini browser, and I swear it is so much more powerful and better than the Sprint built-in browser that I have on my phone otherwise.
1277903	1278383	It's awesome.
1278543	1279584	Well, this doesn't look too bad.
1279904	1281646	Yahoo has its own thing now, too.
1281786	1285529	I'm sure cell phone games are getting better and better, but it's still not my gaming platform of choice, that's for sure.
1285689	1286990	I know what the graphics remind me of.
1287330	1287650	What's that?
1288391	1291794	It reminds me of Rondo of Blood on the TurboGrafx.
1292894	1293515	That's what it looks like.
1294095	1294416	Interesting.
1295477	1297718	All right, well, let's move on to some more stories.
1298219	1301001	Yes, and speaking of other phone-based games...
1302265	1327096	and more homebrew stuff of course MAME has been ported over to the iPhone or at least is beginning to be ported over there right now it doesn't really run a lot but some games like Pac-Man and Q-Bert run pretty well and of course some other ones you have to have with frames skipping and lower sound quality but I don't know, looks interesting yet a start of better things to come I'm sure
1327916	1343728	The iPhone is going to be an interesting platform to program games on because I would think that looks a little bit beefier of a phone at least a pretty large screen on them compared to say a normal phone and then of course with the touch screen and stuff.
1345009	1345489	Be interesting.
1346236	1347357	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1369936	1375438	The thing about Apple is that you know next year they're going to come out with a different model that is a little bit better.
1375458	1375818	Next year?
1375858	1376979	Let's try Christmas.
1378319	1378739	We'll see.
1379540	1379860	I don't know.
1380620	1382801	RossDLUT says, The iPhone sucks for gaming.
1382821	1383801	It has no real buttons.
1384938	1387702	Jaded says, Myspace will redeem the iPhone, LOL.
1388163	1390326	I think that means sarcasm there.
1390647	1393211	Again, if you want to join our chat, chat.orangeonsradio.com.
1393832	1400562	Of course, lots of development going on for cell phone games and also another system that kind of makes people raise their eyebrows when new games are announced for it.
1401042	1405486	Dreamcast, Wind & Water Puzzle Battles, Puzzle Action Game
1431305	1434829	All you hardcore Dreamcast fans can check out those games.
1435329	1438912	I'm still missing... I have a box with my Dreamcast packed in it.
1440093	1440794	Or two boxes.
1440974	1446559	I've only found one, and that one has just the AV cords and controllers.
1446599	1448020	I'm like, where's my Dreamcast?
1448840	1452422	You know, I think I might have it because I've only got two Dreamcasts around here.
1452442	1453383	Oh, maybe that's where it is.
1453503	1453883	Okay.
1454023	1458246	Maybe when your Dreamcast got put in a box of mine somehow when we lived together like three years ago.
1458486	1461188	I need it back just so I can play Dreamcast games.
1461208	1461989	Sure thing.
1462089	1463169	I don't really use it anymore.
1463209	1465171	Would you buy new games for a Dreamcast, DarkSakura?
1465711	1465951	Yes.
1467692	1468253	Just because?
1468893	1469133	Yes.
1469573	1471375	I mean, okay, don't get me wrong.
1471395	1472075	I want my Dreamcast.
1472315	1478239	I don't know if I'd buy new games for the Dreamcast, but if I remember correctly, I think the copy protection of Dreamcast games was pretty crappy, so.
1479045	1482688	Alright, well, I don't think I'll be buying these, but it'll be interesting to see what happens with it.
1482848	1483288	That's for sure.
1485390	1488332	Well, back to more...
1491592	1492913	I think this is really cool.
1493293	1495955	They're basically saying that in the U.S.
1495975	1503899	that the sales of games and consoles has gone up by 37% since the time of 2006.
1503979	1509942	Total sales coming up to $925 million, which I think is actually pretty cool.
1519485	1520466	But it's not a billion.
1521486	1522006	So, you know what?
1522046	1523087	Wake me up when it's a billion.
1523107	1524588	The total sales are at $7 billion.
1524848	1525208	All right.
1525348	1526449	Yeah.
1526749	1530071	But basically, hardware itself is actually raised by 77.4%.
1532872	1535314	$380.8 million sold.
1535814	1537335	And actually, most of it is the Wii.
1537675	1540636	Wait, and this was over the same period last year is what it is?
1540836	1541737	Yeah.
1541777	1542617	Okay, that makes sense.
1542677	1544258	Because, you know, you have new systems out there.
1544298	1548641	I mean, the Wii and the PlayStation 3, for whatever it's worth, that just weren't out there at this time last year.
1548661	1548701	So...
1549489	1554254	And the PS2 and PSP were outselling the Xbox 360, of course.
1556076	1567668	Biggest games of the month were NCAA Football 08 on 360, Guitar Hero Encore, Roxy 80s PS2, Wii Play, NCAA Football 08 on PS2, and Mario Party 8 on Wii.
1567769	1570772	That's amazing that Wii Play still continues to sell so many copies.
1571607	1574288	But I guess it's just people wanting a free Wiimote, sort of.
1574609	1579711	Also, I should point out that sales in Japan have also increased quite a bit.
1581112	1588196	The DS itself went, actually just within a week, sold 153,834 units.
1588316	1591177	That's pretty cool.
1592018	1595139	This is the last week, fiscal week, I should say.
1595900	1598281	For the Wii, it actually made it up to 73,938, thanks to...
1601167	1603128	Some of the really cool games that are out.
1604149	1606930	PSP, no real game success.
1608091	1610512	They've sold 33,715 units.
1612013	1614094	PS3, 21,231 units.
1615695	1616776	Numbers, numbers, numbers.
1616896	1617917	What does it all mean, though?
1618097	1621619	One of the biggest sellers were Everybody's Golf 5.
1622419	1622619	Huh.
1622799	1624400	Which is a game that's not even out here yet, right?
1624640	1624861	No.
1625181	1625501	Interesting.
1626842	1630364	Other, though, games that were giving the PS2 a boost were...
1631463	1632044	J-League winning 11, 2007.
1632244	1638449	But the poor Xbox 360, poor baby, only 2,445.
1641131	1642112	Poor, poor baby.
1642132	1642712	Wait, 2,000?
1642952	1643233	Yeah.
1644073	1645715	Xbox 360s or regular Xboxes?
1645735	1648017	They don't like Xbox 360.
1648217	1649117	No, that can't be right.
1649137	1650118	There's got to be more than that.
1650178	1651699	Blue Dragon sold more copies than that.
1651780	1652300	My apologies.
1652320	1653441	Maybe it's regular Xboxes.
1654802	1656623	It says Xbox 360.
1657404	1658225	Or in the last month.
1660066	1660927	I call shenanigans.
1662495	1664436	I'm hoping a typo then.
1664536	1667136	Yeah, it's got to be regular Xboxes or something.
1667156	1668077	It says Xbox 360.
1669037	1669617	I think it's crap.
1669957	1671058	But it says it's based on region.
1673038	1680701	Anyways, if you want to contribute to those wonderful sales numbers, there's going to be some good stuff coming out this week, especially in the US.
1681761	1688943	Starting off, if you're a fan of golf, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 will be coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, Wii, and PSP.
1692336	1697019	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1716397	1717118	Let's see here.
1717258	1720361	You happen to be looking forward to Dynasty Warriors.
1720721	1726606	Dynasty Warriors Gundam on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 will be coming out this week.
1727667	1736755	Other games to note, MotoGP 2007 on the 360, Warhawk on the PlayStation 3, as well as Lair.
1736795	1740819	Lair is going to be coming out on the 30th, so they kind of bumped it up a week.
1741606	1768157	and let's see on PC Left Behind Eternal Forces the game has been getting some controversy there as well as the Guild Wars expansion is going to be making its way out Eyes of the North and let's see here also on the Wii we've got Metroid Prime 3 Corruption as well as Brunswick Pro Bowling which is supposed to be also coming out on PlayStation 2
1769607	1771149	and PSP, I believe.
1772552	1772973	Okay.
1773534	1775517	Are any of those games something you guys are picking up?
1775618	1779024	I definitely will probably pick up Blue Dragon, even though the demo was kind of eh.
1779734	1781795	and I'll probably pick up Metroid Prime as well.
1782315	1783396	I'm going to be gone most of the week.
1783416	1786678	I'm holding off on Blue Dragon because I think I might get a copy anyways.
1788559	1789059	Some other stuff.
1789179	1790319	Oh, this one is also interesting.
1790339	1791100	I forgot to mention it.
1791200	1794962	On PSP, they've got three games that are pretty cool.
1795082	1796883	Deadhead Fred, which looked pretty cool.
1798183	1805487	And then Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes and Monster Hunter Freedom 2 looked actually pretty good.
1806207	1807588	Are you going to get any of those games, DarkSakura?
1808826	1809506	and DarkSakura.com.
1830791	1832533	Jintama, Jinsan, Toishu, Boku no Kabuki, Machiniki
1855051	1856632	It's an action game, but I don't know.
1856672	1860774	The screenshots of this game look like it has an awful lot of cinematics for being a little bit of an action game.
1862674	1870238	Another game coming out on the PlayStation 2 for Marvelous Entertainment, Katai Kyoshi Hitman Reborn Dream Hyper Battle.
1871038	1872839	Another action game coming out there on the PlayStation 2.
1873997	1880058	Coming out also on the PlayStation 2, Yoki Haim Den, in limited edition and regular formats, an adventure game.
1880398	1881679	Coming to you from Idea Factory.
1882059	1889080	And my favorite title of the week, love it, love it, love it, Nintendo DS will see the release of Love Cat Life.
1889540	1892121	Will be coming out on the Nintendo DS, and here's the best part.
1892601	1897242	If you look at the box art, it is a complete and utter ripoff of Nintendogs.
1897902	1903746	because you have the cute little kitties there on the box art and then it says Love Cat Life written in that same format.
1903826	1904026	What?
1904327	1904667	Rob.
1904907	1905047	What?
1905067	1905327	Rob.
1905547	1905888	What?
1906428	1906708	Rob.
1906868	1907229	You want?
1907449	1908670	Rob, give me baby kitties.
1909470	1910551	I can have Love Cat Life?
1910811	1911772	I want Love Cat Life.
1912432	1914974	Love Cat Life needs to come out over here so I can play with the kitties.
1915775	1917236	Look, the cats sing.
1917296	1919257	There's a singing competition for the cats.
1919557	1920038	They sing.
1920098	1920298	Yes.
1920318	1921178	And look at the thing.
1921198	1921779	You play the...
1922648	1923628	I think you play with them.
1923708	1926869	This game looks like a complete ripoff of Nintendogs in every way except for this cat.
1926889	1927770	The doggies don't sing.
1928810	1929250	That's a good thing.
1929270	1933511	Then there's, look, there's a cat rolling around in a toy truck, a little toy dump truck.
1933531	1934171	Let me see, let me see.
1934752	1935612	That's so cute.
1935912	1936932	And let's see here.
1937312	1940313	A cat looking angry at the food that's been placed in front of them.
1940773	1941674	Oh, sorry.
1942494	1948256	I will post, since I know this makes for great radio, at least for the live folks, I will copy and paste that into chat so you can take a look at the game.
1948276	1949476	He sure makes that face all the time.
1950756	1951557	And now you know why.
1954365	1955266	I don't like this food.
1955346	1957087	Wake me up when they have Lolcats the game.
1958367	1959568	They should totally make Lolcats the game.
1959588	1964531	Dude, there are so many fucking Animal Sim games coming out this fall.
1964691	1965951	It's not even funny.
1966932	1968733	I'm looking at the chat room.
1969193	1971254	Dive says they should make Ninten Ferrets.
1972855	1974996	Kropotkin says no ferret games to be found.
1975036	1976677	Didn't that come up a couple weeks ago on the show?
1977096	1977877	Wild Pet with a Z Wild Pet with a Z
2007190	2007751	Dolphins.
2008632	2010194	Yes, you can have pet dolphins.
2010854	2011876	Imagine babies.
2012336	2014278	That's a pet baby sim.
2014919	2015800	I kid you not.
2015880	2016101	Wow.
2017222	2017963	Imagine.
2021618	2024739	with a Z, by the way, because it's edgy.
2024979	2027180	There's Puppy Love coming out for the Wii.
2027520	2029621	I remember that one.
2029741	2034063	Was it Pets, Dogs, and Cats, and Hamster Life 2 or whatever?
2034163	2036063	All the sequels to those games from last year.
2036183	2038704	Okay, one of our frequent guests of Orange Entree is back tonight.
2038744	2041285	Minklatov's here, fresh from Taco Bell with food.
2041566	2045407	Thanks for smelling up the crappy food in the room.
2046267	2047868	What did you want to say about Imagine Babies?
2048860	2054884	I wonder if it uses that slide sensor that the Nintendo games in Japan use, and you could slide babies around.
2055304	2056525	It's almost like shaking them.
2056765	2057826	It'd be so awesome.
2059968	2062669	Imagine not having babies if you actually buy this game.
2063090	2064431	I imagine it all the time.
2064491	2069574	The Imagine Baby series, or the Imagine series, I guess, is games meant for girls.
2070195	2077960	So they have, I kid you not, they have the babies, they have fashion designer, they have chef...
2078735	2080136	because, you know, women need to cook.
2080496	2083598	And then they also had, what was the other one that they had that was hilarious?
2084018	2085319	Oh, Pet Doctor.
2085339	2087741	I'm thinking my head hurt even more.
2089022	2094765	Well, because, I understand now, because women should cook, take care of the animals, and have babies.
2094985	2096887	That sounds like a perfect lineup to me.
2099048	2102831	See, now it's a bummer the webcam isn't working right now because DarkSakura is giving me the finger.
2102951	2103271	Thank you.
2104532	2105072	Appreciate it.
2105933	2106773	Yes, the webcam broke.
2106813	2107814	I hit it with a mallet.
2107834	2108194	I screwed up.
2108971	2109571	That's the secret.
2109611	2110812	I hid it with my evil power.
2111432	2111713	All right.
2111973	2113033	So how about the UK, Rob?
2113214	2114074	How about the UK?
2114534	2115155	It's awesome.
2116075	2116656	Like a hot dog.
2117916	2119057	Coming out on the 28th.
2121198	2122479	What if I don't like hot dogs?
2123140	2124881	Then 2FU.
2125821	2128463	The only type of hot dogs I like are the Costco hot dogs.
2128743	2129143	What do they got?
2129163	2130364	The Hebrew International ones?
2130484	2131204	Those are really good.
2131224	2132065	Those are the bomb.
2132853	2133473	Anyway, sorry.
2133513	2135674	We used to work over there.
2136494	2136854	You know what?
2136874	2139614	Let's leave Orange Lounge Radio and create the Hot Dog Podcast.
2139634	2140294	That would be awesome.
2141875	2142135	No.
2143795	2145716	Because they are made of lips and thighs.
2146076	2146196	Ew.
2147496	2147776	Anyway.
2148876	2151457	On the 28th, we have Warhawk on PS3.
2152637	2152957	Yay.
2153837	2157558	On the 31st, we have Blazing Angel's secret mission, Boogie.
2158687	2174816	Dragon Ball Z, Goku, Densetsu, Guild Wars, Eye of the North, Stuntman, Ignition on PS2 and Xbox 360, Tales of the World, Radiant Mythology on PSP, Tamagotchi Party On.
2175657	2176978	Why are there still Tamagotchi games?
2176998	2178739	Tamagotchi Party Off, please.
2179359	2179859	Jeez.
2180480	2181860	Tamagotchi Party's over.
2181961	2182401	Go home.
2182521	2184902	Although, you know what I found when I was cleaning, Rob?
2185483	2185703	What?
2185783	2186723	I found my old Digimon.
2187104	2187704	Did you really?
2187724	2187804	Yeah.
2189842	2191244	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2202887	2227471	who can't be more than like 19 holding a young baby who looks to be about 4 years old that's a big fucking baby that's more like an 8 month old baby that's a big baby the baby's as big as she is and the baby doesn't even like imagine that popping out of your you know where's that's gonna hurt and guess what Shane you'll be happy to know that you can rock the baby so therefore you can shake the baby
2228732	2231713	Loki, you need to get us a copy of this game for show research.
2232234	2232914	I will do that.
2232934	2234375	Rob wants to raise babies.
2234615	2235115	That's right.
2235775	2240838	See, now that we have the Operator 11 stuff, we can have these video shows of us playing Imagine Babies.
2240958	2241478	It'll be fun.
2242238	2243239	Super Metroid for the win.
2243959	2245860	I did Super Metroid as a test show tonight.
2245900	2247500	That's the one thing that's on stream right now.
2248201	2248521	It's hot.
2248621	2250402	Well then, can I finish reading the games?
2250422	2250642	Oh, sorry.
2250662	2252223	You distracted me with crap.
2252303	2252943	Sorry, my bad.
2253639	2255160	Only one more game on the 31st.
2255180	2258802	We have Worms Open Warfare 2 on PSP and DS.
2259503	2265106	Another franchise that, while entertaining, while it was new, needs to have that nail in the coffin.
2266087	2267728	Or at least a chainsaw through the coffin.
2269689	2270169	That's it.
2270930	2271250	All done?
2271630	2271970	Africa.
2272171	2272471	You sure?
2272971	2273291	You done?
2273732	2274372	You sure you're finished?
2274472	2275252	My head hurts.
2275272	2276033	Leave me alone.
2276213	2277594	Imagine Africa.
2278154	2278815	Not sucking.
2279855	2280115	Alright.
2281556	2281696	Ow.
2282277	2282537	Anyways.
2286203	2299334	So, yeah, if you don't want to buy something and you want to kind of play a demo of it, there's a brand new demo for Folklore that's finally made its way out from Japan to both Europe and the U.S.
2300360	2301561	I've talked about this before.
2301661	2302541	It's an awesome demo.
2302581	2303241	You should check it out.
2303261	2307643	You actually pull the souls of creatures out of their bodies and fight with them.
2307783	2311925	I didn't like that game, but I didn't understand what the hell was going on when you were playing it.
2311945	2315486	Now that it's in English, it should be a little bit easier to understand.
2315906	2318247	And of course, the full game is coming out early October.
2319708	2320268	Check it out.
2321308	2324509	It's finally nice to see that there's something to download to the PlayStation 3.
2324549	2324830	Hooray.
2325390	2325810	Hooray.
2326564	2330748	Well, I know one game a lot of you folks on the PlayStation 3 are looking forward to is the game Lair.
2331428	2342338	And the president of Factor 5, who is creating this game Lair, Julian Egbrecht, gave a very interesting speech at the recent Leipzig conference going on in Germany.
2343238	2353167	This developer called the ESRB standards and practices a bizarre system and also called Lair's certification process a charade.
2353897	2364009	And he said that in order to be approved for a teen rating, they had to cut out a lot of the blood originally that was in the game, but burning bodies, screaming burning bodies, that was okay.
2365269	2374193	Eggbrecht went on to kind of say, hey, the MPAA's equivalent rating for movies, PG-13, permits this much bigger spectrum of violence.
2375174	2385238	Apparently the ESRB has a taboo against sex in games, especially if you're talking about homosexuals, and is basically trying to get developers to band together against the ESRB.
2385578	2389160	Quote, push the violence, push the sex, but push it in an artistic way.
2389240	2390300	Show that games are art.
2391501	2394402	Interesting little cheer call from the Lair developer.
2395686	2397867	Maybe he's trying to get people to buy Lair to support his cause.
2397907	2398227	I don't know.
2398247	2399608	But Lair looks kind of fun, actually.
2400069	2401509	More games need more butt sex.
2403070	2404231	You want more butt sex in games?
2404251	2405311	Surprise butt sex in games.
2405512	2406232	I don't know about that.
2406792	2407132	All right.
2409574	2411735	So that's all I've got to say on Lair.
2413096	2415157	Well, I have things to say on other stuff.
2415517	2416178	Imagine that.
2416778	2417899	I always have things to say.
2418159	2420420	Imagine Jamie not having anything to say.
2420700	2421881	Hey, Rob, you know what?
2421901	2422181	Shut up.
2423137	2430043	I'll have you know real quick, there's a ton of funny imagine fake box arts that people have done.
2430563	2431924	Like imagine a whore in a bed.
2433565	2433806	What?
2434126	2437168	Imagine, oh my fucking god, kittens in domestic violence.
2437749	2440091	Imagine if you don't eat, everyone will love you.
2441071	2445295	Is imagine whore in a bed the prequel to imagine babies?
2445695	2446456	I don't know.
2447036	2450058	No, because the whore just has a bunch of them and she donates them to science.
2450339	2450599	Whore?
2453283	2454563	Wait, that didn't pick up my mic.
2455524	2456764	Imagine abortions.
2457044	2459665	You could totally use the stylus in creative ways.
2459785	2461185	How about imagine abstinence?
2461245	2463506	Imagine the next story right now.
2464046	2464807	Hey, Rob.
2465167	2466307	What?
2466807	2472969	Anyway, so the PSP's on-demand video service is out in Europe in 2008.
2473089	2474349	Isn't that amazing?
2474409	2475350	It's called Go.
2476030	2476730	So you just go.
2478671	2479211	Hey, Jamie.
2479531	2479891	Go.
2479991	2480271	Go.
2480531	2480931	No.
2481832	2482772	Imagine going.
2485137	2488659	Is that going to be like our new in-joke that we're just going to beat into the ground?
2488919	2489819	It's already been done.
2490039	2490680	I hate to tell you.
2491140	2491580	It's over.
2492321	2492801	Walk away.
2493481	2495362	So what's the big deal about this?
2495522	2497163	It's a video download service.
2498284	2502105	It will have a rich selection of high-quality entertainment, so it says.
2502626	2503866	Can I watch Lost on it?
2505207	2509069	It's basically in conjunction with Sky's on-demand video.
2509972	2512873	So no, you won't be able to watch Lost on it because you're not in the UK.
2513133	2513794	Yeah, Rob.
2514634	2515454	You can pretend.
2515675	2519816	Well, can I travel to the UK and download Lost and then come back over here and watch it?
2520257	2525979	Only if you live in the UK and can pay for it in the UK and all that.
2526439	2528820	GS68 in our chat room sums it up really well.
2528860	2529901	He says, stop imagining.
2530821	2531902	There you have it.
2531962	2533522	GS68 also wants to know, can I watch porn on it?
2533542	2535203	Will there be porn on the on-demand service?
2535783	2537064	It just says entertainment.
2538427	2539248	Adult Entertainment.
2539629	2541490	So maybe it's like the Fapparama channel.
2541671	2542752	I don't know.
2542772	2543692	How old are we tonight?
2543713	2543692	13?
2543733	2547856	12?
2543793	2547856	That porn on-demand service that you're looking for is called the web browser.
2548357	2548677	Oh, okay.
2549438	2549838	Thank you.
2550039	2551820	It's supposed to be like sports movies.
2551900	2552841	Rated E for everyone.
2553942	2555684	Tunes, that type of stuff.
2556104	2556385	All right.
2556665	2558647	Well, hooray for the on-demand video service, I suppose.
2559628	2561570	It would probably be like Skin and Axe level.
2562090	2563051	Not very interesting porn.
2564278	2565099	Well, guess what?
2565199	2569502	There is something else to kind of go along with the other Go thing.
2570403	2583213	Go Messenger, because I have to say it that way because there is an exclamation point in the middle of the word there, is a PSP, I mean voice and video chat service that will be available also in Europe.
2583934	2584614	And apparently...
2587040	2587140	Go!
2587160	2587380	Messenger!
2587400	2587440	Go!
2587480	2587801	Messenger!
2617031	2617912	Is that what you're saying, Loki?
2618592	2618813	Yes.
2619513	2619773	Alright.
2620674	2623316	Roboboy430 in chat wins with this comment.
2623817	2625638	Agents are go!
2626960	2627260	Get it?
2628601	2628881	Get it?
2629882	2631624	It wasn't a PSP joke, I'll give you that.
2632264	2634006	Rob, I need Vicodin to finish this show.
2635157	2635717	I might have some.
2657884	2666671	It's going to also use the PSP's remote play features so you can watch live TV and record TV programs remotely on your PSP over a Wi-Fi connection.
2666711	2672716	It's going to be first available in the UK, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain with more PAL territories to follow.
2673116	2676679	Finally, a reason to have such a big hard drive on the PlayStation 3, yes?
2677519	2678440	Well, in Europe.
2679125	2681006	I'm still waiting for an excuse over here.
2681146	2683207	Don't you think that it's inevitable this will come out here, though?
2683227	2684628	Or do you think they're, like, testing it in Europe?
2684708	2688750	They're not going to because there's no standardized digital service over here.
2689050	2689390	Duh.
2689751	2693893	So until that happens, we'll still be waiting.
2694773	2696374	Well, couldn't they team up with one service?
2696574	2699496	Kind of like, didn't Xbox 360 team up with that new AT&T service?
2700196	2700556	I don't know.
2700616	2705719	But I would think if they're going to do a digital service, do, like, a satellite service.
2706548	2708670	DarkSakura's Mailbag Segment
2731229	2731469	Yep.
2731669	2732129	Hooray!
2732289	2734610	So we have a nice mailbag segment for you guys tonight.
2734991	2742234	Of course, you can always interact with us by sending mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com your emails, and DarkSakura will open up the mailbag and read some of her favorites.
2742274	2743114	So let's go to it.
2744815	2746395	Reach in the mailbag and pull something out.
2746415	2747596	What's there this week, DarkSakura?
2748576	2749257	Some stuff.
2750977	2752778	The first of the emails.
2752878	2753498	Dun, dun, dun.
2754519	2757260	Hey guys, I really like your idea about picking a game and playing it on air.
2757725	2763811	Dear OLR, listening to your ideas for games coming from old movies, I feel compelled to suggest that several of these studios get together and
2781257	2782117	and make a Smash Bros.
2782177	2789020	or Capcom vs. SNK-styled fighting game which brings the protagonists from these old classics together to beat the ever-loving crap out of each other.
2789600	2793161	Specifically, I wish to see Ewoks fighting the alien cat from The Cat from Outer Space.
2794001	2795141	Perhaps also Skeletor.
2795322	2795782	That is all.
2795882	2796382	Warrior Bob.
2796862	2797802	Warrior Bob is great.
2797902	2799343	He's so much fun to hang out with.
2800483	2802764	I was going to say, backing up to the last email real quick.
2803729	2807271	Thanks to our new thingy on Operator 11, that is definitely a possibility.
2807752	2814636	And that was all done on the laptop, so I can haul that thing over to Jamie's house and we can have ourselves some TurboGrafx playing broadcast.
2814656	2816597	So we are going to look into doing that in the future.
2816657	2817118	Yes, Jamie?
2818018	2818278	Yes.
2818459	2818939	This must happen.
2818979	2820120	And it does have the audio.
2820160	2821741	It's not very good, but it does have the audio.
2822721	2824362	We could have ways around that.
2824442	2824643	Yes.
2824703	2826044	With proper editing.
2826204	2827124	There are ways.
2827544	2828905	We have the technology.
2828965	2829366	We can...
2830518	2830838	Build it.
2831239	2832740	Okay, if you build it, they will come.
2832760	2833100	We'll see.
2833740	2838644	Also, I want to say about the next email, what would you guys want to see in a game like that?
2838784	2839765	A Super Smash Bros.
2839805	2841266	game with movie characters.
2841346	2842727	Chatroom, that's open to you guys, too.
2842807	2843628	Just out of curiosity.
2844949	2847010	It's too bad we already have a topic for tonight's list list.
2847030	2847671	This would be a good one.
2848331	2849032	What are you eating?
2849712	2850153	Ice cream.
2850333	2851314	That's what I ran out to get.
2851374	2853415	I want ice cream.
2854136	2854476	Let's see.
2854576	2855937	What characters from movies would be good?
2855957	2858199	How about some of the characters from Kill Bill, of course?
2859178	2860659	Brokeback Mountain, Mikla Tom?
2860679	2861639	I don't know if that would work.
2863660	2865220	Who would fight in Brokeback Mountain?
2865701	2867321	Would the two guys switch out?
2867341	2868942	There was already a fight in that movie.
2869202	2869522	Was there?
2869702	2870042	Yeah.
2870082	2871583	A little bit.
2872944	2875365	Oh, could you use a tire iron as your special weapon?
2876765	2877686	I got food in my mouth.
2880027	2880887	Anyway, never mind.
2880907	2881767	This was a bad idea.
2882287	2882768	Oh, wait.
2882788	2883548	We got the chat room.
2883588	2884008	Thank God.
2884228	2885969	Kropotkin says, Silent Bob.
2886983	2888724	DJ Dark Knight says, what about Ricky Bobby?
2888744	2889504	Blood Man and Chronic.
2891265	2893626	Black Boy says, Rose McGowan from Planet Terror.
2894306	2894746	There you go.
2896227	2897568	David Bowie from Labyrinth.
2899008	2901409	With a special sidekick, his crotch.
2902410	2904011	Labyrinth versus Dark Crystal.
2904171	2904891	This must happen.
2906492	2907132	All right, next email, please.
2907152	2908993	David Bowie as the king of all cosmos.
2910313	2911254	That would work.
2911454	2912234	Oh, my God.
2914735	2916396	He does sort of look like that now, too, doesn't he?
2917045	2917825	He's still hot, though.
2919265	2919726	Greetings.
2919786	2922986	First of all, thanks for providing such an entertaining podcast on a weekly basis.
2923126	2923546	You're welcome.
2923586	2924027	Give me a dollar.
2924627	2926087	Hey, I'm the one who asks for a dollar every week.
2926747	2927907	I listen to it every week.
2927927	2928748	Okay, give me five dollars.
2929608	2929848	Rob!
2931628	2933809	If you're not going to share, don't eat in front of us.
2936409	2936869	Oh, never mind.
2936929	2938270	It's caramel, and caramel sucks.
2940050	2941090	I'd rather have a taco.
2942050	2943571	It's dulce de leche, just so you know.
2944131	2944391	Yuck.
2946696	2948037	Read the email, lady.
2948337	2949817	That's what we pay you to do.
2950097	2951158	Shane's making me laugh.
2951218	2951798	I can't stop.
2952998	2954519	First of all, okay, I already read all that.
2956280	2959441	Oh, I listen to it every week and it makes my drive to work that much more tolerable.
2960661	2961462	Sorry about this week.
2961482	2963082	I hope we didn't run you off the road.
2963102	2964483	I want to read the email, Rob.
2964523	2965443	I have a bunch of them.
2965543	2966744	I want to interrupt you, Jamie.
2967184	2968925	I want you to kiss my ass, but not.
2968945	2973406	It's funny because it's all in the email, this conversation.
2974007	2974707	No, it is not.
2975470	2976530	Shane said it was on the email.
2976731	2977111	It's not.
2977491	2978071	A little background.
2978111	2979932	I've been playing video games for over 28 years.
2980332	2984034	I am now 35 and have a family, which probably is a little different from your main audience.
2985234	2989036	I also recognize that a lot of the places you guys describe because I'm a Bay Area person as well.
2989756	2992097	Anywho, I will try to keep this short, famous last words.
2992957	2995058	And I don't think you quite accomplished that, but oh well.
2996078	3002321	Regarding the discussion of Red Rings on Xbox 360, I completely understand Loki's frustration in regards to some fans or fanboys.
3002898	3004799	Commenting regarding the failure rate.
3005619	3016882	Countless forums and blogs have perpetuated this 33% failure rate as fact when in reality is merely a number drawn from a tired interview in Australia with some anonymous XEB game employees.
3017142	3017862	Someone's ass.
3018662	3018922	Yeah.
3019843	3028805	While I wouldn't care if fanboys or other systems believe this themselves, I am irritated with misinformation spread around and influence potential buyers to not buy one because of false rumors.
3029557	3033578	Of course, I am in an awkward position actually agreeing with Loki as he tirelessly attacks the Mac.
3034098	3034539	Just kidding.
3034599	3037619	I am a Mac fan, though, and even worked for Apple for a time.
3038300	3044662	Isn't that amazing how many Mac fans we have that stick with this show even though Loki, you know, bashes Apple products when he can?
3044802	3048443	Just because I don't like them doesn't mean you shouldn't like them.
3048763	3054345	I'm giving you my opinion and you're like, well, we should all think like you.
3054445	3055565	Way to be sheep.
3056295	3058135	Your Mac made me want to die last night.
3058215	3062856	You know, if you didn't challenge my opinion, then, you know, you would just be sheep.
3063016	3064957	Why did my Mac make you want to die last night?
3064997	3067617	Because you actually need to put AIM on that.
3068037	3068377	Why?
3068698	3069298	Use Mebo.
3069358	3070078	I hate Mebo.
3070478	3071038	I hate you.
3071638	3072338	I hate you back.
3073318	3073699	Email.
3074399	3076059	No, you were mean to me, Rob.
3076159	3076839	I'm going to leave now.
3076859	3076919	Bye.
3076939	3077779	Do you want some ice cream?
3078099	3078419	Yuck.
3078439	3081660	Are you trying to make my butt bigger?
3083440	3084161	What kind of ice cream?
3086667	3087188	Play online.
3087208	3091373	My question for all of you is how much do you truly enjoy playing with strangers online?
3091393	3091993	Oh, I love strangers.
3105455	3105775	DarkCharger
3132444	3162076	I don't like to play with strangers online either my mommy told me not to talk to strangers especially on Xbox Live once in a great while I will but I totally use that feedback feature if I have to so okay and which I will not read online as per your request thank you for your PS oh yes I saw that too the PS is freaking rad especially since well my other hobbies ah fair dear yes my other hobbies anyway next email
3162797	3166760	This is from Robert M. Just two quick thoughts.
3167481	3173206	One, I almost hope Uwe Boll announces plans to make a movie based on Manhunt and is immediately sued by you-know-who.
3173946	3180852	That particular clash of personalities would likely end in destruction of the career of one or both, seeing how neither would back down prior to that point.
3182213	3192201	Secondly, I was wondering if HMMJDS has only songs from the Disney show of the Hannah Montana game.
3192904	3196126	or stuff from the average non-fan of the show would recognize.
3196186	3199047	According to IGN, it does allow you to create your own music tracks.
3199928	3204110	Nothing about song lists, though, or if play-to-the-present music is even an option.
3204370	3205871	I don't know, but I'll try to find out.
3206151	3207372	I'd be surprised if it weren't.
3208553	3213675	And apparently... Is Footy Monster our resident Hannah Montana fan in chat tonight?
3214656	3216477	I do see he is, so maybe he can answer that.
3216537	3216877	I don't know.
3218158	3220519	Nobody loves Hannah Montana more than Footy Monster.
3221660	3221780	Um...
3224103	3229527	The next email, hi guys, MiserCrazy, I guess that's how it's pronounced here.
3231589	3235151	I'm new to your podcast and I think you guys are funny as hell, especially DarkSakura, you crack me up.
3235271	3235952	Oh, thank you.
3236932	3238554	I crack lots of people up when I have a mallet.
3239474	3251823	Anyway, I was wondering if any of you would know if there are any plans for Nintendo on releasing any TurboGrafx-16 CD-ROM or Super CD games on the virtual console, like Splash Lake, Monster Lair, or Dracula X. Oh God, I love you already.
3253089	3256451	Can you think of any Turbo CD games that you'd like to see on the Virtual Console?
3256791	3257992	Thanks and keep up the good work.
3258453	3261495	Um, I'm just going to say knees are crazy.
3262315	3263976	Since he actually put his name in the email, but.
3264677	3279066	Um, I would love to see, um, the Valus series on, um, on, uh, um, it was, it wasn't a super, it was just one of the, the, um, this regular Sega CD games.
3280007	3280087	Um,
3281437	3282958	I would actually love to see Sapphire.
3283898	3287080	It was a game that was one of the arcade CDs.
3288281	3291643	It was actually one of the first polygon-based shooters.
3292463	3295125	Very, very, very good game.
3295225	3300488	I am by no means an expert on these old CD-based systems, so I will simply say Night Trap and leave it at that.
3300808	3303409	That wasn't even on the TurboGrafx.
3303449	3304430	Well, it should have been.
3305150	3307311	No, because Night Trap kind of sucked ass.
3307912	3310133	Okay, it sucked a lot of ass, but it had Dana Plato in it.
3312544	3315666	I'd love to see Rondo of Blood out there.
3316086	3320108	I was a little distracted during that previous email because I was trying to talk to FootyMonster in the chat room.
3320128	3324491	I heard us say his name on the show, but he was too busy looking at porn to hear what the question was.
3325191	3332855	And FootyMonster did finally, after I clarified with him, he says, It's not known right now what music is in the Hannah Montana game, but I'm guessing it will be from the show.
3333235	3335316	At least that's what the big hairy guy on the stage said.
3337457	3338538	The big hairy guy on the show?
3338558	3339819	In the porn or in the Hannah Montana thing?
3339999	3340719	Just kidding.
3342751	3343031	Okay.
3343531	3344332	More email.
3345072	3346593	God, there's a bunch of really long ones.
3346673	3347333	Iken has email.
3348234	3348914	God, seriously.
3349374	3350995	Okay, this one says, call me Surtur.
3351975	3352215	Okay.
3352275	3352816	Hi, Surtur.
3353796	3357978	Every Monday morning I wake up and my magical PSP has downloaded the latest OLR podcast.
3358038	3360159	I can listen to it on the way to work.
3360199	3362020	I've been playing Jeanne d'Arc.
3362520	3365001	It is a strategy RPG based on the Joan of Arc story.
3365441	3367222	Who says the PSP doesn't have great games?
3368283	3368623	I don't know.
3368963	3369563	I think I've said that before.
3369583	3370504	That would be Shane saying that.
3371953	3373274	Thanks again for the show every week
3400327	3401667	Rondo of blah, blah, blah.
3402668	3402948	All right.
3404188	3405128	And Brooktown.
3405148	3405488	And Brooktown?
3405548	3406128	No, no Brooktown.
3406168	3406869	I'll pass on that.
3407289	3407889	Cake land.
3408349	3408569	All right.
3408589	3408889	Anyway.
3409449	3412210	Hello, this is Kropotkin from Kropotkin and Hendrix Game Review Show.
3412230	3412590	That's cool.
3412610	3412770	Hi.
3413490	3414370	He's in our chat room tonight.
3414490	3418271	And that's the show that's sandwiched in between us when we have our rebroadcast on all games.
3418731	3419172	That's hot.
3419472	3419652	Yes.
3420152	3425333	I've been listening to your shows while traveling to and from where picture of my place of work is below.
3425393	3426353	Okay.
3426533	3429074	The email that we use is non-HTML, so sorry.
3429094	3429334	Dope.
3430894	3434435	and thought I'd drop you a line considering the lack of email you've been getting recently.
3434875	3435676	That's the one week.
3437036	3441317	Oh, and yes, that is the... Oh, okay, I'm going to skip on past the location stuff because it says I can't show that.
3441738	3446699	You know, since this email is coming from a British listener, I think you should read this in an accent.
3447500	3447700	No.
3449180	3451521	No, I'm not, because I'm tired and I have a concussion.
3453441	3455742	I think you should read it within a spot of accents.
3455882	3457163	I don't care if you have a concussion.
3457183	3457383	Oh, no.
3458638	3468443	So yes, my email topic, what do you think is going to... I'm not reading it!
3468663	3471104	I don't care how you read it, just read the damn email!
3471925	3472865	Excuse me, Shane, hi!
3472885	3474706	Then remove him from the studio!
3475186	3476427	This is horrible radio!
3477988	3479829	Tell Shane to shush.
3480069	3480869	Shane, shush.
3481430	3481770	Email.
3482510	3482790	Now.
3483310	3484251	Okay, where was I?
3485311	3486352	So he gets me an email topic.
3486732	3492694	What do you think it's going to take to stop the gaming industry focus on the six-week window at the end of the year to sell games?
3493494	3499517	This year is just chronic for amazing titles being squeezed into this short period of time.
3499997	3503118	Just to give you an idea of how bad it is this year, take a look at the list.
3503618	3505219	Super Paper Mario, not out in Europe yet.
3506079	3507360	Metro Prime... Metro...
3508149	3528105	Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Halo 3, PGR 4, Assassin's Creed, Crisis, Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4, Unreal Tournament 3, Ratchet & Clank, Tools of Destruction, World in Conflict, Haze, Heavenly Sword, Medal of Honor, Airborne, Sega Rally, Lost Odyssey, Ace Combat 6, Jericho, Enemy Territory, Quake Wars, Two Worlds.
3529446	3531767	Do you remember a game called Beyond Good and Evil?
3531848	3533469	It was a great game that appeared in Autumn of 2003.
3534109	3535230	I do remember that game, actually.
3537133	3541656	It was buried by many other less entertaining titles and undeservedly end up in the bargain bin.
3542377	3546960	Makes one wonder which out of the games will suffer a familiar fate.
3547280	3556987	So I ask you and the rest of the OLR team, when is the gaming industry going to wake up and realize that the video games can be released year-round and not just near Christmas time?
3557348	3564673	For what it's worth, my view on it is that when people stop seeing video games as only for children games, will this...
3568204	3569766	will cease to be holiday-only sale.
3570046	3572089	Sadly, I don't see that attitude changing anytime soon.
3582869	3584310	It's development cycles, I think.
3585871	3590175	If you look at it, of course they want to try to get as many sales in before their fiscal years are up.
3590195	3596100	That's why you see both Christmas and March as big times for games.
3596220	3600563	Right now, since I sell games at work, we work on order forms and that kind of thing.
3601084	3602985	For August, it was three pages long.
3603326	3606148	For October, it's about...
3606928	3612253	10 to 11 pages long, and November, I'm guessing, probably around 15 pages long.
3612353	3623021	So that kind of gives you an idea of how much stuff is coming out, and it just gets lumped into that week wherever the 15th of November falls, and then after that, drops down to nothing.
3625463	3630106	So it's more of the fault of the soccer moms of America than the gaming industry necessarily, right?
3630126	3631467	Because of all the holiday craziness?
3631687	3631887	Yeah.
3632328	3632468	Hmm.
3633467	3638371	But I mean, if a good game was released in April, or what's a dead month for gaming?
3638431	3639952	Like, probably April, May?
3640212	3640833	Super dead.
3640853	3647998	Okay, if a good game is released in April, I mean, shouldn't that still translate to good sales for the company year-round, right?
3648379	3652942	Yeah, I mean, look at, well, this April, there was Super Paper Mario and Guitar Hero 2 on the 360.
3653943	3655124	And those games sold awesome.
3656085	3658807	Another example of a slow month, July.
3659067	3662470	There was NCAA Football 08 and NASCAR.
3664187	3665627	and Mario Strikers, I guess.
3666388	3668608	But other than that, there wasn't a whole lot.
3669109	3678692	There's times now, during the summer, it's like, well, shit, there's nothing I really want to play for a while, whereas in the fall, it's like, crap, there's too much stuff.
3678772	3680112	I don't know what I want to play.
3681172	3686214	People aren't going to spend more money towards fall on games.
3686434	3689055	I think if they just spread out the releases all year long,
3690151	3690972	Dead Rising came out in August.
3690992	3691192	Really?
3691252	3691753	I thought.
3710663	3712424	No, I don't remember coming out late.
3732290	3737553	Sometimes you have the Oscar movies trying to push for awards or whatever, but you know, there's a lot of debt.
3737573	3741855	The same kind of cycle, because when do the consumers buy most of their movies?
3741916	3743817	During the summer when the kids aren't in school, right?
3744157	3745518	And then same thing with CDs.
3745598	3747799	CDs follow a very similar pattern to video games.
3748039	3756584	All the big CDs come out, what, September, October, November, up to the Christmas season, and then when you get into January, it's a dead month for the CD and music releases.
3756884	3760366	Of course, I'm not sure how online distribution changes all that, if at all, but...
3760726	3762148	Dead Rising was August 9th, 2006 Shall I move on to another email?
3762188	3762549	If you must
3773812	3779756	Dear OLR crew, after listening live last week, I went and downloaded the podcast and heard all the praise for Bioshock Go Around.
3779856	3786081	If Rob was so convinced to buy it, even though he wasn't a first-person shooter kind of guy, then by golly, it's something I need to take a look at.
3786521	3793065	I went and plunked down $200 on a video card the next day and stuck it in my computer, and the first thing I did was go and download the Bioshock demo.
3793466	3794306	Friggin' amazing.
3795167	3799590	I need this game right now, although paychecks not being till the end of the month preclude this.
3800014	3801176	Thanks to Rob for convincing me.
3801216	3805884	The only complaint I have is the movement is a little sluggish for my taste reminiscent of playing Halo on the PC.
3806485	3808509	I was looking for that run button everywhere.
3809662	3812804	on the 360 because of the awkwardness of dual analog input.
3813145	3818068	I imagine this allows for more precision, but I guess I just like my games at faster paced.
3818608	3823812	I thought the atmosphere was amazing with the voices and footsteps signaling there was something out there that you can't see.
3824132	3824993	Chilled me to the bones.
3825613	3833079	Of course, my friend who's a complete Counter-Strike addict played the demo and said, I can hear them from a mile away and if they didn't make any noise it'd be scarier when they popped out.
3833579	3835181	I don't think everything jumped out.
3835201	3839024	There was one section in the game where there were pipes that were breaking that was freezing people.
3857310	3885741	and so like I was picking up some plasmid or something I turned around there's this guy just standing there I'm like holy shit and killed him but it was a corpse so I think it's a good mix of both that scares me I mean not too much of one or the other I think creepy noises can be very creepy and then you know the the boos and like a scary movie is the same way right a good scary movie has a little mix of both your jump out of your seat moments as well as your builds up are you shaking your head in disagreement Mikotov yes whoa don't stick that right in my mouth um
3887192	3908998	I would say that the atmospheric scary is way better than the pop out of nowhere scary even though in the Silent Hill PSP demo I did jump a couple times because of the stupid pop out of nowhere sort of scariness but I feel that's a cheap thrill whereas the noises and the atmosphere stuff is way better and you've
3910421	3915406	I think I would say that the atmosphere adds to the pop-outs.
3915466	3918989	It makes it even more scary.
3920150	3923113	I tried to play Bioshock PC, but my video card couldn't handle it.
3923233	3923593	Cry?
3925415	3929578	I have to say that I prefer the atmosphere setup.
3929638	3931320	I really love psychological stuff.
3931809	3932910	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3953556	3956678	I've seen tragedies that Gross fits in with.
3956758	3978015	I think that a good horror movie or game is something that you don't really know it's meant to be scary, I think, where you think it's just situational and then when something completely unexpected happens, not the jumping out, but when you hear the noises and then you think, oh, well, it's going to be this thing and it turns out to be something completely different.
3978515	3982178	I like the twist, especially when it messes with your head.
3983732	3987114	Battle Royale was funny too.
3988315	3988515	Huh?
3988856	3991898	Nothing, I was saying that Battle Royale wasn't scary, it was funny.
3992138	3994339	I think Silence of the Lambs is a way better movie than something like Saw.
3994359	3995620	Silence of the Lambs is really good.
3996081	3997642	But anyway.
3998863	4000424	Hey OLR, it's me, Solar Wing.
4000484	4004827	I can't be in the chat tonight as work frowns upon me using their internet for live radio stream and such.
4005607	4008089	I just wanted to start this off by saying thank you.
4008269	4012172	OLR saved my sanity and possibly me saying something I'd regret.
4013217	4016940	I took a short trip out to Alberta to see some family and go back to my past.
4017340	4019262	Of course, there was the obligatory meeting of the cousins.
4019842	4030751	To describe them, they are blonde valley girls who by some freak chance of nature have more than one brain cell and can pull high marks out of their pretentious asses.
4031852	4035915	I brought my DS and my PSP, but I couldn't get the meeting out of my head.
4036596	4038597	I was going over what I would say in the morning.
4040839	4042921	Okay, some of the wording is a little bit odd here.
4044694	4047216	Before I do that, I listened to the podcast I'd previously downloaded.
4047736	4054220	I brought 21-odd casts and listened to about 8 for a bit, but I was getting more annoyed.
4055340	4058082	But then I started to listen to your show and I started to calm down.
4058662	4062644	The humor and pacing was perfect for what I needed, which was to calm the hell down.
4062945	4065046	I forgot all about the night and simply enjoyed the show.
4065586	4073811	For that, I'm truly thankful, and the only thing that I can suggest is adding the catchphrase vehicular homicide is wrong even if they are your cousins.
4074727	4078189	Vehicular Homicide is great, especially if they're your cousins.
4080231	4082612	I don't understand, because how is this show calming?
4082632	4084633	Because this show has me more on edge tonight.
4084774	4086495	I think it's because we're distracting.
4086555	4086695	I guess.
4087295	4090697	And if you don't think about the crap that's pissing you off, then maybe you feel better.
4091158	4095360	Because tonight's show makes me want to do vehicular manslaughter on my cousins.
4095380	4096161	You're mean to me, Rob.
4096961	4097842	You're so mean.
4098102	4098482	Whatever.
4099023	4100364	Get over it, baby.
4101024	4102305	Imagine not being a baby.
4102325	4104186	All right.
4106502	4107563	Are there more emails?
4107823	4108663	No, there's just this one.
4109844	4110865	Oh my god!
4111245	4113466	How many freaking emails did we get this week?
4113967	4115948	You do know we like to finish the show in like three hours, right?
4115968	4116728	I'm reading the rest of this.
4117128	4117309	Hush.
4117789	4118529	Alright.
4119210	4119390	Rub.
4121151	4121351	No.
4122352	4130977	To bring this back to video game talk, before I left for my trip, it's tradition I buy a new game, so I've been holding out and getting Phoenix Wright 2, as I've never...
4131917	4132537	Played the first one.
4132557	4133837	I would like to play them in order.
4134397	4135838	I picked it up but didn't open it.
4136138	4139758	Well, I was out there and had a chance to go around the area and found an EB.
4140538	4145179	We went in and I found the first Phoenix Wright for less than $50.
4145279	4148940	It was the lowest bidding off of eBay before I left.
4149400	4152540	It was actually $34 Canadian with tax.
4152661	4155181	Alberta only has like 6% tax compared to 15%.
4156301	4158341	So I picked that up and have almost beaten it.
4158742	4161342	This game is at least a must-rent if you have a DS.
4161772	4167735	From there we went to the West Edmonton Mall and I found ourselves in an arcade where for the first time I saw Guitar Freaks in Dromania.
4168235	4172177	I can now agree that Guitar Hero wasn't original, but did a lot of things right.
4173118	4175899	Now listening to the last week's show, I have some questions for you.
4176059	4176979	The Smash Bros.
4177480	4188185	site has been updating their site daily and I only have to say I can't wait for this game to come out, but do you think they will have
4188854	4190715	Run on sentences are very, very hard to follow.
4207503	4212747	Now I know why when I read the email you said I'm like Jamie when I was yelling about their grammar and stuff.
4212828	4214149	Let me put it this way.
4214549	4220494	As much as I'd like to see online, I think there's going to be as much online as there is punctuation in this email.
4225918	4232123	I wish they would go online with it, and I wish maybe that would be a big surprise Nintendo's going to pull out of their butt.
4233328	4235269	Come, uh, you know, the end of the year.
4235349	4239312	Maybe it'll be a big E for All announcement since nobody else is going to announce anything at E for All.
4239412	4239852	I don't know.
4240232	4242233	But I'm, I'm not holding my breath.
4243114	4244995	Super paraphrasing powers activate!
4245515	4245995	Okay, yes.
4246836	4247076	Okay.
4247877	4249297	Um, this one's for you and me, Rob.
4249918	4254000	Since we both played Ragnarok Online, which I think is funny to being referred to, um, a.k.a.
4254060	4255801	Fisher Price, my first MMORPG.
4256362	4256742	Okay.
4258451	4268181	he and his sister quit their crippling RO addiction and they're on the way to the 13 RO, the 13 steps what is a good MMO to play?
4269863	4280654	she suggested World of Warcraft but she says it looks complicated World of Warcraft's not that complicated try Rose Online Rose Online I don't know that one um
4281417	4282198	Puzzle Pirates Tetranet
4305242	4305482	PSU is crap!
4324625	4326886	Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.
4327407	4337793	I suggest if you're going to play one of the Phantasy Star MMOs, go for Blue Burst because it's a lot better and you can actually use a force in that game without having to retardedly crap it.
4338393	4339834	Dark Knight says, stop hating.
4340774	4341735	I can hate all I want to.
4341755	4342335	It's a free country.
4344677	4345177	That was great.
4345657	4346758	Shane says to play a better game.
4349299	4353302	He wants our Wii codes, but we'll have to put them back up.
4353602	4353842	Anyway.
4354764	4355285	Jamie is awesome.
4376462	4378663	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4400489	4424163	In both the original and evolved versions But you get 60 Atari 2600 classics That's right, 70 games in one Hell yeah That's a lot of games That is a lot of games I want 70 versions of Metal Slug There probably will be someday Give it time One day, one day
4424821	4428448	Yars Revenge, Night Driver, Canyon Bomber, Crystal Castles
4438168	4439409	Crystal Castles is great.
4439609	4440830	Crystal Castles is pretty rad.
4440950	4441410	But I don't know.
4441450	4445553	I feel like a lot of these classics, I've already played to death elsewhere.
4446034	4446374	I don't know.
4446654	4448175	I don't know if I can get that excited about it.
4448315	4448695	Oh, I'm sorry.
4448715	4450317	Those weren't the evolved titles.
4450337	4451898	Those are just some random titles they were saying.
4452198	4453879	Can I play over the internet or with other people?
4453899	4455460	You can play with other people Wi-Fi.
4455640	4457642	And it will also have an online leaderboard.
4458502	4461404	So, and what else?
4462545	4466308	Actually, it says, oh yeah, you can just compare scores.
4467048	4471532	I was going to say, hopefully it has it over the internet, but the evolved titles, I guess.
4471672	4480479	Asteroids, Asteroids, Deluxe, Battlezone, Centipede, Lunar Lander, Millipede, Missile Command, Super Breakout, Tempest, Warlords, and Pong.
4481620	4483441	Wow, super evolved Pong.
4483502	4484142	I can't wait for that.
4484182	4485343	Hey, they had Tempest in there.
4485683	4486684	Yeah, Tempest is cool.
4487685	4491348	I saw you playing Space Giraffe earlier, Miklatov, while we were done, so what did you think?
4492455	4492995	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4514333	4515975	Liss, Rock Band, Guitar Hero 3
4530703	4542272	10 new songs were announced this week, including Ruby by the Kaiser Chiefs, Radio Song by Superbuss, and Minus Celsius by the Backyard Babies.
4542672	4547235	I've not heard of a lot of these bands, but apparently it's some more international flavor, so hooray for diversity.
4547275	4547656	Wait, wait, wait.
4547676	4549137	What was the first one that you mentioned?
4549457	4550017	Kaiser Chiefs.
4550037	4551638	That's the only one I've heard of from the list.
4551699	4553520	No, you mentioned... Sorry, it must have been the second one then.
4554601	4555061	Oh, hell.
4555081	4556002	Superbuss?
4556022	4556222	Yeah.
4556242	4556322	Yeah.
4557960	4558600	I closed the list.
4558620	4559461	Don't worry about it.
4559561	4560601	Superbus, that was it.
4560661	4563343	That's pretty cool.
4563543	4573951	Also coming to Rock Band, some songs you might know a little more in-depth stateside, such as The Rolling Stones with Gimme Shelter, The Clash, Should I Stay or Should I Go?
4574171	4574711	I like that song.
4575031	4583117	Smashing Pumpkins with Cherub Rock, Nine Inch Nails, The Hand That Feeds, Beastie Boys, Sabotage, and one of my favorites, Radiohead with Creep.
4584520	4586882	Because I'm a creep, I'm a winner Anyway
4612839	4641580	I like Cherub Rock in the game I like Smashing Pumpkins Smashing Pumpkins is cool I guess So speaking of Guitar Hero 3 though moving on to other games that are trying to be like other games Guitar Hero 3 is going to have a demo inside the Xbox 360 version of Tony Hawk's Proving Ground It actually will be released in the UK on October 9th and the demo will be included with it before it makes it onto Xbox Live
4642225	4661173	So, they're saying that what's going to be listed is Laid Down by Priestess, Even Flow by Pearl Jam, The Metal by Tenacious D. I love Tenacious D. Hit Me With Your Best Shot, As Made Famous by Pat Benatar, and a cover of Rock You Like a Hurricane.
4662913	4664414	What are the Scorpions doing anyway?
4665454	4667075	Why can't they just use the tracks?
4667175	4667915	Stinging people?
4668216	4668536	No.
4669436	4669836	God.
4671537	4671737	Well,
4673626	4676567	That's great news, but here's something even funnier.
4677507	4692112	In the ongoing battle between Sony and, I guess, PSP hackers over firmware control, you know, who will dominate, I think the hackers may have actually launched the final blow.
4693424	4694164	PANDORA'S BATTERY
4722233	4724495	to actually create your own debug battery.
4724575	4735802	So with that and a combination with a PSP memory stick, you can downgrade, you can unbrick any PSP, no matter the firmware.
4736403	4738804	So that's pretty awesome.
4738864	4739225	Nice.
4739685	4741166	It will downgrade anything to 1.5.
4741746	4746530	If you have a bricked PSP from failed whatever, it will fix it.
4747770	4749512	Now how much is this puppy going to cost?
4749912	4750172	Nothing.
4750352	4751233	It's free to download.
4751273	4751433	Okay.
4752051	4755252	Yeah, you download the program, you run it on your PC.
4756113	4760935	All you need is a PSP battery to create this debug battery.
4761175	4766377	You can return the battery back to its normal mode afterwards if you'd like.
4767177	4773040	The only thing you will need, though, is to create this device, you will need one of the custom firmwares.
4773520	4778962	But, I mean, if you have a friend that has that, you create this, and then you're good to go on any PSP.
4779102	4781043	Hooray, Kid Icarus on my PSP again!
4782293	4786636	and all that stuff, but you know,
4810822	4812169	Show a little homebrew love.
4812852	4813295	Little bit.
4813455	4813737	Little bit.
4814455	4820237	Anyhow, moving on to a title that was creating a lot of news in recent weeks on the program, Manhunt 2.
4821057	4823218	A lot of folks thought this game was dead in the water.
4823298	4824339	It's going away.
4824499	4829821	No more are we going to see this because you just can't fix the game down from an A.O.
4830301	4830521	rating.
4830561	4831101	Well, guess what?
4831181	4840624	It has been modified down to an M-rated version and Manhunt 2 will be out on the PlayStation 2, PSP, and Wii on Halloween, October 31, 2007.
4842445	4844587	What a hilarious day to release this game.
4845007	4852913	A quote from Rockstar founder and president Sam Houser, quote, Manhunt 2 is important to us, and we're glad it can finally be appreciated as a gaming experience.
4853474	4857957	Manhunt 2 is a powerful piece of interactive storytelling that is a unique video game experience.
4858297	4859879	We think horror fans will love it.
4860839	4863561	Nowhere, though, has it been said what exactly they had to change.
4864042	4870807	I mean, obviously they've scaled down some of the violence, perhaps, but as to specifics, your guess is as good as mine.
4872506	4873266	They added bunnies.
4874227	4878149	I hope all they did was submit a different video to the ESRB.
4878429	4880570	Well, they have to play the game, don't they now?
4881991	4884592	When I was still at Konami, we still just did videos.
4884932	4886653	So, who knows?
4886733	4889314	I hope they don't have to cut anything because I want that game.
4890754	4892956	What they did is they changed all the blood to sweat.
4893436	4896578	Or all the blood to fire, remember, because it's okay to burn people alive.
4896638	4898840	It's just not okay to have them bleed.
4898960	4904404	But there will be a secret blood code in the game that will restore all the blood from the original demo.
4904464	4906385	As will unlock a sex minigame as well.
4906465	4913050	Yes, and you can use your game genie to change the colors of the sweat as well to make the experience that much more realistic.
4914490	4916452	But sweat is great.
4916472	4916572	Right.
4917299	4918540	You know what I always thought was funny?
4918880	4924505	Because I've got the Samurai Shodown 2 at the Japanese cart for my Neo Geo.
4924866	4927288	If you switch it from Japanese to English mode, the blood changes color.
4928589	4929470	I'm not even joking.
4930390	4933833	You have the big spray of sweat, and then you change it into the big spray of blood.
4934114	4939078	If I developed video games, I would actually put a code that changes the blood into sweat just to be funny.
4939438	4942601	Like to make reference to the old school Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat.
4942921	4943902	That was fantastic.
4944477	4945417	Okay, anyway.
4945737	4947518	How about something regarding Eidos?
4948298	4948518	Okay.
4948698	4951379	And something that I love, which is Highlander.
4952019	4958801	Because however many shows are based off of cutting people's heads off, not too many.
4959261	4960181	Not a lot that I can think of.
4961142	4962322	Buffy, kind of.
4963002	4965043	That's staking or cutting their head off.
4965063	4966763	One and a half.
4966803	4968124	One and a half, I agree with that.
4968464	4969124	I love Buffy.
4970864	4972325	Angel, not so much because he was a whiny bitch.
4972905	4973165	Anyway.
4973185	4973265	Okay.
4974383	4975904	There can be only one.
4975944	4976564	There can be only one.
4999016	5015588	It's a third-person action game that will cross 2,000 years from feudal Japan, from Scotland in the old days, Pompeii, New York in the future, and you go all over the place cutting off people's heads.
5016268	5018990	Sadly, I think this is going to be timed with a new movie that's coming out.
5020271	5021932	Yeah, they're making another Highlander movie.
5023920	5026541	I hope the wizard's face isn't in it, because that man is lying.
5026581	5027702	He almost kills everybody.
5027822	5029203	Do you understand?
5030283	5030964	Stop it, Rob.
5031824	5034185	I am Conor McCloud of the Clan McCloud.
5034826	5038968	I was born in 1518 in the village of Glenfinnan on the shores of Loch Shield.
5040008	5040909	Now I am immortal.
5041889	5048272	Okay, my favorite line in the first one is when he keeps calling Ramirez an overblown haggis.
5048673	5051094	I am Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez.
5052310	5056933	Chief Metallurgist to King Charles V of Spain, and I'm at your service.
5057834	5059935	Why does he sound Scottish if he's Spanish?
5062717	5070102	It also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head.
5070182	5073765	A head which at this time has no name.
5073825	5075086	I know his name.
5076006	5077467	His name is Mr. Heady.
5079549	5079849	Anyway.
5080979	5085341	You play Owen McCloud, and you fight 77 other people.
5086441	5088962	And you have 18 missions so far.
