20000	23000	Sony confirms a video recorder for the PlayStation 3,
23000	27000	and a much anticipated 360 game gets pushed back to December.
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	41000	We are that video game podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41000	46000	My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
46000	47000	My head is numb.
47000	49000	Who doesn't have a microphone on tonight?
49000	50000	I do now.
50000	51000	There you go. How are you doing?
51000	53000	Hey, I have a head injury, so leave me alone.
53000	55000	I'm sorry to hear. What happened to your head?
55000	59000	I was getting out of the car and then I was getting back into the car and my foot slipped out from under me.
59000	60000	I see.
60000	64000	On the gravel outside and I hit my head on the top of my Lancer.
64000	65000	Aw, sorry to hear it.
65000	67000	Metal hurts when it hits you in the head.
67000	68000	Yes.
68000	76000	It was like one moment I'm upright, the next moment I actually have my head laying on the seat of the driver's side of my car.
76000	80000	Do you think that the great people up in the sky were trying to tell you something?
80000	81000	I have a concussion, Rob.
81000	82000	Sorry to hear it.
82000	85000	Well, this should make for a riveting tonight's show, so we'll see.
85000	88000	All right, also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
88000	89000	Hello.
89000	90000	Hi, Loki. How are you doing?
90000	91000	Doing good.
91000	92000	Excellent.
92000	98000	All right, well, let's get into how we like to start the show off always with a little bit of how is your gaming week.
98000	106000	If you want to join along and participate in the program, though, head on over to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and you can participate in tonight's program.
106000	107000	Meanwhile, let's start it off.
107000	109000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
109000	113000	I played a bunch of Final Fantasy VI in the car and then didn't save it.
113000	115000	That's not good.
115000	120000	On a Game Boy Micro, I was extra motion sick for the entire time. It was fantastic.
120000	127000	And then I got like 2 million, I'm sorry, 2 billion on a World Cup soccer the other day. I was pretty happy.
127000	128000	Pinball?
128000	129000	Yes, pinball.
129000	130000	Pinball fun?
130000	133000	Well, hi, they just take up space. I have no choice but to play them.
133000	136000	What's more fun, pinball or Final Fantasy?
136000	137000	Pinball.
137000	138000	All right, just curious.
138000	140000	I would sell Final Fantasy Pinball if that existed.
140000	141000	Dude, that would be beautiful.
141000	142000	They should make a Final Fantasy Pinball.
142000	147000	But pinball is instant gratification because it goes banging. It makes noises.
147000	148000	And I actually...
148000	149000	It's banging.
149000	154000	Dan took the glass off of our Twilight Zone, so I put the camera in and took pictures from inside the machine.
154000	158000	You know what else would be cool with pinball machines? A laser light show, if they could do that, too.
158000	163000	Tonight's show is very broken. I'll explain why in a minute. I'm trying to multitask in a lot of different ways.
163000	167000	Anything else you want to share with your gaming week, Dark Sakura?
167000	171000	I don't like concussions. They should make concussion the game.
171000	173000	How exactly does that work? How would concussion the game?
173000	175000	You just go around hitting people in the head.
175000	181000	And the worse of a head injury you give them without killing them, the better you score.
181000	187000	All right, well, let's go over to Loki and check in with you. How was your gaming week?
187000	193000	My gaming week was good. Not quite as extensive as last week, but still good.
193000	198000	Let's see, of course, being that Bioshock came out, of course they played tons of that.
198000	201000	And I haven't really gotten too far in it yet.
201000	204000	I actually restarted the game once because I realized...
204000	208000	I'm trying to streamline my achievement getting there.
208000	212000	And I realized there was an achievement for not killing any of the little sisters.
212000	219000	So, unfortunately, I rescued the first little sister and then killed the second one because I wanted to see what happened.
219000	220000	What happened was...
220000	222000	You just want to see what happens when you kill little girls.
222000	229000	What happened was that I was unable to get an achievement, so I need to restart the game, so now I'm doing that again.
229000	233000	I love how you'll go back and play the whole game over just because you missed an achievement.
233000	237000	Oh, hell yeah. Well, I don't want to have to play the whole game over again.
237000	241000	And I wasn't that far to begin with, so now I'm just going back and doing what I did.
241000	249000	And then, of course, I played the Silent Hill Origins demo that magically got leaked out there.
249000	256000	So, I played that on the PSP, and I gotta say, man, between what we saw originally, like the Konami BBQ,
256000	259000	to what it is now, completely different game.
259000	262000	I mean, this game looks friggin' awesome.
262000	267000	It's just... I don't know, it looks actually better than some of the PlayStation 2 versions.
267000	271000	So, definitely one to pick up on the PSP.
271000	276000	And, let's see, other than that, I actually played a little bit of Saints Row.
276000	283000	We finally got our entire game room up at work, and we did a five-player Saints Row deathmatch on that.
283000	286000	It looks sweet, the setup we have, and hopefully I'll have some pictures soon.
286000	289000	What exactly does your game room at work consist of?
289000	297000	The game room at work consists of five Xbox 360s, and there's LCD monitors for each one of those.
297000	305000	And then, four of those are tied into a 37-inch LCD TV that we have mounted to the wall.
305000	310000	So, if you really wanted to, you can actually tune in on the TV, four different monitors,
310000	313000	and see what other people are, you know, their perspective.
313000	316000	So, if someone's watching us play, they don't have to look over our shoulders,
316000	320000	they can actually dial it in and see what other people are doing.
320000	325000	Or, you know, you can just play it on the TV if you're only doing one person on there or something.
325000	330000	So, other cool things we talked about doing with that is actually like Project Gotham Racing,
330000	334000	where you could do four people actually racing each other,
334000	337000	and then the fifth one would be on the big screen,
337000	342000	and that would be kind of one of the spectator mode options there,
342000	347000	so that way everyone's racing and you see like kind of a racetrack view of the whole game.
347000	348000	So, that would be pretty slick.
348000	354000	But, it's basically for the event that we've got coming this coming week,
354000	356000	with our publishers coming out and stuff.
356000	363000	And also, really it's for Grand Theft Auto IV, because we're that obsessed with Grand Theft Auto.
363000	367000	Too bad you got all that set up, and now you're going to have to wait until next year, though.
367000	370000	That's okay. We've got Saints Row in the meantime,
370000	374000	and we're going to beg the publishers to give us copies,
374000	379000	multiple copies of upcoming games that would possibly be something we'd want to play.
379000	383000	All right, well, let me get some comments here from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchrader.com.
383000	385000	I'm looking at rawstealut says,
385000	389000	Not killing any of the Little Sisters is how you get the best ending, too.
389000	393000	And then undeadzerglings asks, Achievement Whore?
393000	395000	Yes, Loki's an Achievement Whore.
395000	398000	He will buy games just to get the achievement points out of them.
398000	401000	Not necessarily. I don't really do that anymore.
401000	406000	I will play games that are crappy for your achievements sometimes.
406000	409000	Out of the last few Xbox Live Arcade releases,
409000	412000	how many would you say you bought strictly to get the achievement points out of them?
412000	417000	None of the recent ones, because I've kind of got a little bit smarter on that.
417000	425000	But let's see, previous ones that I bought for achievements, Pac-Man, Frogger.
425000	427000	Shit, what else did I buy?
427000	432000	I don't know, there's quite a few games that I bought on kind of like an impulse buy.
432000	437000	Luckily now I've gotten it where I don't buy games straight out right.
437000	440000	I will play the demo first, except for Catan.
440000	446000	Catan had to download the full thing, but I knew what that was before I played it.
446000	453000	But yeah, now I strictly play the demos first, and then if I like it, I'll buy it.
453000	457000	SHA100Matt in our chat says, so Loki is more of a high-priced whore now.
457000	459000	Exactly.
459000	462000	My gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
462000	466000	I, unlike most of America, did not run out and buy Bioshock right away.
466000	469000	Because I'm kind of holding out to see if some used copies or a price cut shows up.
469000	471000	Plus I'm going to be in LA most of next week.
471000	475000	I would say, well locally you can buy it at Fry's for $49.99.
475000	478000	Really? See, that's what I'm holding out for, some deals like that.
478000	480000	I heard Circuit City was doing some type of sale too.
480000	482000	That's the other thing too I was going to say.
482000	489000	I bought the limited edition, and I'm sure everyone read on the internet that they've had some problems with the figurines breaking.
489000	497000	And I was so lucky that I went into GameStop, and there's a big fucking post-it note on mine that says broken figurine.
497000	503000	And they're looking at it, and they're looking at me and kind of thinking in their heads, how are we going to get this guy to take it?
503000	509000	So they're all, yeah, this is the last one, and the figurine's broken.
509000	514000	I don't know what to do to fix it, so I needed to go to some website.
514000	517000	I'm like, well do you have the website that I'm supposed to go to?
517000	520000	Well I don't know what it is, let me check my email.
520000	522000	Finally they got it for me.
522000	527000	But you know, to be honest, I opened the thing up, took some super glue to it, you can't even tell it broke.
527000	530000	So I don't care, I don't want the fucking art book.
530000	533000	You can download it for free, I don't need that thing.
533000	538000	But the other thing about the limited edition, if you are, I don't know if you can still buy them now,
538000	543000	but if you are thinking about buying one, let me put it this way, the remix CD that they have on there with three tracks,
543000	547000	they're remixed by Moby, they suck really bad.
547000	551000	They are some of the worst remixes I have ever heard.
551000	557000	I mean, it is just, I would be embarrassed if I was Moby and releasing that shit.
557000	558000	It was awful.
558000	560000	Moby did a whole album of awful though.
560000	566000	I haven't watched the behind the scenes DVD or anything like that, so I can't really judge that.
566000	570000	But that, I popped in that music CD last time, like ooh, remixes, I'm going to check it out.
570000	572000	No, it was crap.
572000	574000	Awful, awful, awful crap.
574000	578000	But the game is awesome though, so it doesn't matter.
578000	580000	I just wanted the figurine for my desk.
580000	583000	Didn't give a shit about the extra CD.
583000	587000	Alright, well let's see, what did I do for My Gaming Week?
587000	592000	My Gaming Week, oh gosh, I didn't do a whole lot of new stuff.
592000	596000	I did play some of the new offerings on Xbox Live Arcade, like Space Giraffe.
596000	599000	Space Giraffe is interesting because it tries to assert itself that it's not Tempest,
599000	601000	although it kind of is Tempest to me.
601000	603000	But here's the thing, and I love Tempest,
603000	606000	Tempest 2000 is one of my favorite games of all times.
606000	608000	Space Giraffe is really hard to see.
608000	612000	The colors that they chose to use in this game, the purples and the yellows,
612000	616000	they all blend together and it's really hard to make out what the hell is going on in this game.
616000	619000	Unlike the old school Tempest, where the web was blue,
619000	624000	the enemies were red, your bullets were green,
624000	626000	it was really easy to see everything kind of stick out,
626000	629000	and not so easy in this one.
629000	632000	I wasn't big on the visuals in Space Giraffe,
632000	635000	although I did think some of the jokes were really funny.
635000	637000	There's pictures in the background,
637000	641000	and when you get the pods that let you jump off the web,
641000	644000	it will say, Pod Get, and all these interesting things.
644000	645000	That's fantastic.
645000	646000	It's kind of funny.
646000	649000	It's obvious that the developers obviously love themselves some games,
649000	650000	but I don't know.
650000	654000	The visuals really take a lot away from the game for me.
654000	656000	So that's really it.
656000	659000	Other than that, I've just been trekking along as usual on World of Warcraft.
659000	661000	I'm looking forward to playing Overlord,
661000	663000	because I just got a copy of that,
663000	664000	so I'm going to be checking out Overlord this week.
664000	666000	So we'll see how that goes.
666000	667000	It's awesome.
667000	670000	I would be still playing it if Bioshock didn't come out.
670000	672000	It's just stupid fun.
672000	675000	I mean, it's one of those games that they try to convince you
675000	680000	that doing the right thing is going to benefit you in some way,
680000	685000	and then just unfortunately the AI just really pisses you off,
685000	688000	and you're just like, fuck it, I'm going to kill you all now.
688000	693000	And then you realize, hey, helping them out actually didn't do anything for me,
693000	697000	so I'm just going to kill them all.
697000	698000	All right.
698000	700000	That's pretty much it for my Game of the Week.
700000	703000	I don't have a lot else to share, so what else do we get into now?
703000	705000	I guess we can move on to some housekeeping.
705000	707000	So housekeeping.
707000	710000	First off, we are going to be incorporating video into the show real soon,
710000	713000	and that's why you've heard me kind of messing around a little bit
713000	716000	during the pre-show there, and I am somewhat distracted,
716000	719000	because on the laptop I'm playing with this site we're going to be using
719000	722000	to stream our video, operator11.com,
722000	725000	which if you guys are familiar with All Games All Games Interactive,
725000	727000	it's the website they use,
727000	730000	they've been encouraging some of the other shows on the network to start using it.
730000	733000	Although I do want to make clear, we're not turning into a TV show,
733000	736000	and we're not going to be using video too heavily.
736000	740000	We just want you guys to be able to see us as we broadcast the show if you want.
740000	742000	I don't know why people would want to see that.
742000	745000	And we're not going to be using the, was it the...
745000	747000	You can call us with your webcam and all that stuff?
747000	749000	Well, that...
749000	751000	Hey, playing porn on the webcam,
751000	754000	that was something that we did back at the old apartment,
754000	758000	a couple studios ago, when we used to play Gals Panic over the webcam.
758000	760000	Yeah, no, we're not going to be turning into a TV show suddenly,
760000	762000	it's just like a little something extra.
762000	764000	And the funny thing is, I was streaming the first part of the show,
764000	766000	but this is how fickle it is and how broken it is,
766000	768000	I was actually streaming the first few moments of the show,
768000	770000	and then I accidentally clicked the wrong link, and now it's gone.
770000	774000	Like, I accidentally refreshed the page and screwed everything up.
774000	777000	So I'm going to have to start over again later or something, I don't know.
777000	778000	So I'm still trying to get used to this program.
778000	780000	So maybe we'll stream part B, I don't know.
780000	782000	But it's off now, it was going.
782000	785000	But in the channel, there's some video of me playing Super Metroid earlier,
785000	786000	but the audio is all screwed up.
786000	788000	I really don't encourage you to visit it.
788000	789000	It's not worth your time.
789000	791000	We're trying, though.
791000	794000	We've heard a lot of folks, especially the folks that listen to us live on Sunday night,
794000	797000	want to see video, so we're trying to add that into the show,
797000	799000	but we're not going to go TV all of a sudden.
799000	801000	Why would you want to see video?
801000	802000	I don't know.
802000	803000	We don't do anything.
803000	804000	We don't really do anything.
804000	805000	I don't know what you think this is.
805000	808000	Are they under the impression that there's an actual lounge in here,
808000	811000	that we're all kicking back with martinis or something, you know?
811000	813000	Just shooting the shit.
813000	816000	I mean, we're just sitting in a small room.
816000	821000	I think it has potential maybe later on if we want to shoot video
821000	825000	at whatever tournaments we end up at or shows we end up at.
825000	828000	We can put that in the show and interviews we do as well,
828000	830000	and then the video users can see video,
830000	832000	but the audio users don't have anything taken away from them.
832000	833000	You know what I mean?
833000	836000	So I just want to see how we can enhance with video.
836000	837000	But that's a long time coming.
837000	838000	We'll see.
838000	841000	If you have ideas, e-mail us, mailbag at orangelandrader.com,
841000	843000	and I, of course, will be talking to some of the folks
843000	846000	that already use Op 11 and see what they think.
846000	848000	But I don't want to go crazy with a TV show,
848000	850000	and Dark Soccer doesn't like TV either,
850000	853000	so I know she's not a big fan of the television.
853000	857000	Especially with Scott's public access green screen,
857000	859000	his little test thing.
859000	860000	I'd laugh.
860000	862000	I was just like, oh, my God, dude.
862000	863000	Good times.
863000	864000	All right.
864000	865000	Well, anyway, let's get into some gaming news.
865000	867000	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some gaming news?
867000	869000	It's so incredibly cheesy.
869000	871000	Anyways, no, gaming news.
871000	873000	So this week, a little interesting.
873000	876000	We're going to start things off, of course,
876000	879000	talking about a very interesting development out of Leipzig,
879000	884000	and that would be the new track and field game on the DS.
884000	887000	It's, I guess, the 25th anniversary of track and field,
887000	889000	and as you remember last week,
889000	892000	I could care less about the Xbox Live Arcade game,
892000	895000	but now there's the new international track and field game,
895000	900000	which is going to feature 20 different athletic events,
900000	905000	and I guess there was going to be some unlockable Konami characters to play,
905000	910000	including they've got Sparkster from Rocket Knight Adventures
910000	913000	and Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2,
913000	915000	which, to be honest, I think Pyramid Head would win
915000	917000	because he'd just butcher everybody else,
917000	924000	but I wonder if raping people is one of the events in there
924000	927000	because he only rapes monsters.
927000	929000	Pyramid Head being in the game is all kinds of awesome, though,
929000	930000	you have to admit.
930000	932000	That's pretty rad.
932000	934000	Anyway, later in the program, during part B,
934000	936000	we'll be talking about characters we would like to see
936000	939000	in this track and field game in a segment we call Listless,
939000	942000	but we'll get into that a little later in the program.
942000	944000	They didn't say anything else about the events
944000	946000	or any additional, like, how the game will play.
946000	947000	Is it going to be button mashing again?
947000	949000	That's what I want to know.
949000	951000	Well, I'm assuming since it's on the DS,
951000	953000	it's probably going to have something to do with the stylus,
953000	955000	but they didn't really say anything other than
955000	959000	there will be four player matches via,
959000	961000	they said locally or via Wi-Fi.
961000	966000	I'm assuming Wi-Fi ad hoc and Wi-Fi infrastructure.
966000	970000	Downloadable content and online rankings, leaderboards,
970000	972000	and detailed player profiles.
972000	974000	So that's kind of cool that they're going to do leaderboards
974000	976000	and that kind of thing.
976000	980000	And I guess a ticker to include, like, a news feed.
980000	983000	It says promise to update anyone playing online
983000	986000	whenever a world record is broken.
986000	989000	Oh great, so playing the new track and field is going to be like watching CNN.
989000	991000	You're going to have to try and watch what's going on in this box,
991000	993000	and you've got the ticker down here,
993000	995000	and then you've got the stock report over here,
995000	998000	or, I'm sorry, the people that are online over here.
998000	1000000	How did they cram all that on a DS screen?
1000000	1001000	It looks cool.
1001000	1005000	I'm surprised they didn't do, like, a Wii version to go along with that, you know.
1005000	1011000	Alright, looking at chat here and what's going on there,
1011000	1013000	your nickname says,
1013000	1017000	Memo to Konami, use the fucking DDR pad for track and field.
1017000	1021000	Undead Zurgling says, I think Pyramid Head only rapes dolls.
1021000	1023000	No, he rapes the nurses too.
1023000	1027000	Escapist says, just what the world needed, more track and field.
1027000	1030000	Nintendo Maniac 64 said, Pyramid Head's in track and field? Dude!
1030000	1034000	And then going back to the webcam chat we had just before the show started there,
1034000	1038000	let's see, we had Jaded says,
1038000	1042000	I think it would be funny seeing Loki kick everyone's ass during one of his fits about Max.
1042000	1047000	Kropotkin says, I mean, seeing people's faces stresses what people are thinking and saying.
1047000	1050000	Dark Knight says, remember Rob did TV before.
1050000	1053000	That was, like, ten years ago. I wouldn't even count that.
1053000	1055000	I'm an old man now.
1055000	1057000	My young, fresh television face is long gone.
1057000	1059000	Alright, let's...
1059000	1060000	Now it's kind of moldy.
1060000	1062000	Yes, it is getting a little moldy and wrinkly.
1062000	1066000	Alright, but you'll be able to see it in all its glory in Op11.com pretty soon.
1066000	1070000	As soon as I figure out how to get through an entire segment without screwing it up and deleting all the video.
1070000	1071000	That'll be wonderful.
1071000	1076000	I did want to say that for anyone who actually watches Deviant, who's on DeviantArt,
1076000	1080000	UdonKru did the cover art for the track and field game.
1080000	1086000	So you can actually check out their DeviantArt page for some of the work they did on it.
1086000	1088000	And some of those chibi characters were really cute.
1088000	1090000	Like, chibi Pyramid Head is still a winner.
1090000	1092000	I do have to agree with Shane, though.
1092000	1095000	They used the movie P-Hitty.
1095000	1098000	They didn't use the P-Hitty that you love and adore?
1098000	1100000	No, not the one with the unwieldy, gigantic head.
1100000	1102000	Sorry to hear it.
1102000	1105000	Well, moving on to other DS releases that will be upcoming very soon.
1105000	1109000	Final Fantasy IV has gotten some coverage in Famitsu Magazine.
1109000	1112000	And you can get your hands on some of the latest scans there from Famitsu Magazine.
1112000	1114000	They're all around the web.
1114000	1116000	And boy, this game looks pretty hot.
1116000	1122000	I mean, imagine, again, Final Fantasy IV, but in Final Fantasy III's engine, so to speak.
1122000	1124000	And I was just looking at some of these screenshots.
1124000	1125000	It looks great.
1125000	1127000	It looks like you still have five people on the battlefield, obviously,
1127000	1129000	because that was kind of important to the story.
1129000	1131000	But I was looking at pictures of, like, here's a picture.
1131000	1133000	I know this is great television here.
1133000	1136000	But here's a picture of Rydia looking all younger and everything.
1136000	1138000	And the Dragoons.
1138000	1139000	Pretty awesome.
1139000	1142000	I know dsfamboy.com has a picture of the scans if you want to check that out.
1142000	1145000	I'm sure they're all around the internet as well, though.
1145000	1148000	However, no release date still revealed for this game,
1148000	1153000	but probably pretty soon in Japan and probably a little bit longer for us in the U.S.
1153000	1156000	Have you heard anything about a release in the U.S. for this, Loki?
1156000	1159000	No, the next two games come out here.
1159000	1164000	There's Final Fantasy Tactics The Lion War, Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings,
1164000	1172000	Front Mission DS, and Dragon Quest Monsters Joker.
1172000	1177000	And this will probably be, if anything, in the spring, maybe.
1177000	1178000	We'll see.
1178000	1180000	Well, that's all I have to say on Final Fantasy IV,
1180000	1182000	but it is one of my favorite Final Fantasy games,
1182000	1184000	so I'm very excited to see what they pull off of this.
1184000	1186000	Yeah, wake me up when they bring out VI.
1186000	1187000	Rob, are you spoonie?
1187000	1188000	It's a possibility.
1188000	1189000	You're a spoonie bard.
1189000	1191000	I'll have you know.
1191000	1192000	No.
1192000	1195000	Well, for anyone who's into mobile gaming,
1195000	1199000	there is an offering for the mobile phone.
1199000	1206000	This Castlevania Order of Shadows that they're saying is a collaboration with Igarashi,
1206000	1208000	who I got a hug from.
1208000	1209000	That was great.
1209000	1210000	Well, sort of.
1210000	1212000	I took a picture with him.
1212000	1219000	But I thought that it was very interesting that it just says collaboration,
1219000	1222000	so I don't really know if he's actually going to be involved on it.
1222000	1227000	There's also a developer's corner on the mobile website for Konami
1227000	1232000	where they have it listed there as the lead game designer is Tyrone Rodriguez.
1232000	1234000	So, anyway.
1234000	1236000	But it's supposed to be released on September 18th,
1236000	1239000	so if you really care, then have fun.
1239000	1248000	I was looking at some of the pictures of it, and, well, I don't know.
1248000	1249000	It's a cell phone game.
1249000	1251000	How great can it be?
1251000	1252000	I'll tell you what, though.
1252000	1254000	It has the skull thingies.
1254000	1257000	There's some pretty powerful stuff on cell phones right now.
1257000	1259000	Will it be dualed?
1259000	1262000	Well, not like that, but not necessarily game-wise, but application-wise.
1262000	1263000	Like, you know how you can download Gmail
1263000	1265000	and actually run that as an application on your phone?
1265000	1268000	Depending on what, like, your phone has to be kind of made in the past couple years,
1268000	1270000	and it runs like Java-based things.
1270000	1272000	But now they have an Opera mini browser,
1272000	1276000	and I swear it is so much more powerful and better than the Sprint built-in browser
1276000	1277000	that I have on my phone otherwise.
1277000	1278000	It's awesome.
1278000	1279000	Well, this doesn't look too bad.
1279000	1281000	And Yahoo has its own thing now, too.
1281000	1283000	So, I'm sure cell phone games are getting better and better,
1283000	1285000	but it's still not my gaming platform of choice, that's for sure.
1285000	1287000	I know what the graphics remind me of.
1287000	1288000	What's that?
1288000	1292000	It reminds me of Rondo of Blood on the TurboGrafx.
1292000	1294000	That's what it looks like.
1294000	1295000	Interesting.
1295000	1298000	All right, well, let's move on to some more stories.
1298000	1302000	Yes, and speaking of other phone-based games,
1302000	1304000	and more homebrew stuff, of course.
1304000	1306000	MAME has been ported over to the iPhone,
1306000	1309000	or at least it's beginning to be ported over there.
1309000	1312000	Right now it doesn't really run a lot,
1312000	1316000	but some games like Pac-Man and Qbert run pretty well.
1316000	1320000	And then, of course, some other ones you have to have with frame skipping
1320000	1321000	and lower sound quality.
1321000	1324000	But, I don't know, it looks interesting.
1324000	1327000	You had a start of better things to come, I'm sure.
1327000	1331000	But the iPhone's going to be an interesting platform to program games on
1331000	1336000	because I would think that looks like a little bit beefier of a phone,
1336000	1338000	at least a pretty large screen on them,
1338000	1341000	compared to, say, a normal phone.
1341000	1344000	And then, of course, with the touchscreen stuff.
1344000	1346000	It'll be interesting.
1346000	1349000	It still doesn't sell me on an iPhone just yet.
1349000	1351000	Oh, fuck no, it's $600.
1351000	1353000	Well, you remember Extrofer from the show, right?
1353000	1356000	He just bought an iPhone, and he's all crazy about it.
1356000	1359000	There are some really cool things that the iPhone does, don't get me wrong.
1359000	1362000	And there is that impulse buyer in me that kind of wants one.
1362000	1364000	And I think I put to somebody else,
1364000	1368000	an iPhone is probably on my list of wants above a PlayStation 3 still.
1368000	1372000	But the thing about Apple is that you know next year
1372000	1375000	they're going to come out with a different model that is a little bit better.
1375000	1378000	Next year? Let's try, like, Christmas.
1378000	1380000	We'll see. I don't know.
1380000	1381000	RossdielUT says,
1381000	1384000	The iPhone sucks for gaming, it has no real buttons.
1384000	1388000	Jaded says, MySpace will redeem the iPhone, lol.
1388000	1390000	I think that means sarcasm there.
1390000	1393000	Again, if you want to join our chat, chat.orangessontrader.com.
1393000	1396000	Of course, lots of development going on for cell phone games,
1396000	1399000	and also another system that kind of makes people raise their eyebrows
1399000	1402000	when new games are announced for it, the Dreamcast.
1402000	1407000	Yes, the Dreamcast still has games being built for it.
1407000	1410000	There's some games being made by Red Spot Games,
1410000	1414000	and at the Leipzig Games Convention they were showing Dalforce.
1414000	1417000	It's a shooter title, which is up to four players,
1417000	1419000	because remember the Dreamcast, you had four ports on there.
1419000	1422000	And there's another game called Wind and Water Puzzle Battles.
1422000	1426000	It's a puzzle action game that's being ported from another system.
1426000	1430000	Both games are scheduled to be released in the first quarter of 2008.
1430000	1435000	So all you hardcore Dreamcast fans can check out those games.
1435000	1439000	I'm still missing, I have a box with my Dreamcast packed in it.
1439000	1444000	Or two boxes. I've only found one, and that one has, like,
1444000	1446000	just the AV cords and controllers.
1446000	1448000	I'm like, where's my Dreamcast?
1448000	1452000	You know, I think I might have it, because I only got two Dreamcasts.
1452000	1454000	Oh, maybe that's where it is, okay.
1454000	1456000	Maybe when your Dreamcast got put in a box of mine somehow,
1456000	1458000	when we lived together like three years ago.
1458000	1461000	I need it back just so I can play Dreamcast games.
1461000	1463000	Sure thing, I don't really use it anymore.
1463000	1465000	Would you buy new games for Dreamcast, Dark Saga?
1465000	1467000	Yes.
1467000	1468000	Just because?
1468000	1469000	Yes.
1469000	1471000	I mean, okay, don't get me wrong.
1471000	1472000	I don't buy Dreamcast.
1472000	1474000	I don't know if I'd buy new games for Dreamcast,
1474000	1476000	but if I remember correctly, I think the copy protection
1476000	1479000	of Dreamcast games was pretty crappy, so.
1479000	1481000	All right, well, I don't think I'll be buying these,
1481000	1483000	but it'll be interesting to see what happens with it.
1483000	1485000	That's for sure.
1485000	1492000	Well, back to more present-day gaming information,
1492000	1493000	I think this is really cool.
1493000	1496000	They're basically saying that in the U.S.
1496000	1502000	that the sales of games and consoles has raised,
1502000	1509000	gone up by 37% since the time of 2006.
1509000	1515000	Total sales coming up to $925 million,
1515000	1519000	which I think is actually pretty cool.
1519000	1521000	But it's not a billion.
1521000	1522000	So you know what?
1522000	1523000	Wake me up when it's a billion.
1523000	1524000	The total sales are at $7 billion.
1524000	1525000	All right.
1525000	1526000	Yeah.
1526000	1531000	But basically, hardware itself is actually raised by 77.4%.
1531000	1535000	$380.8 million sold.
1535000	1537000	And actually, most of it is the Wii.
1537000	1540000	Wait, and this was over the same period last year is what it is?
1540000	1541000	Yeah.
1541000	1542000	Okay, that makes sense,
1542000	1544000	because you have new systems out there,
1544000	1546000	the Wii and the PlayStation 3, for whatever it's worth,
1546000	1549000	that just weren't out there at this time last year.
1549000	1555000	And the PS2 and PSP were outselling the Xbox 360, of course.
1555000	1560000	Biggest games of the month were NCAA Football 08 on 360,
1560000	1564000	Guitar Hero Encore, Roxy 80s, PS2 Wii Play,
1564000	1568000	NCAA Football 08 on PS2, and Mario Party 8 on Wii.
1568000	1571000	That's amazing that Wii Play still continues to sell so many copies.
1571000	1574000	But I guess it's just people wanting a free Wiimote.
1574000	1575000	Sort of.
1575000	1581000	Also, I should point out that sales in Japan have also increased quite a bit.
1581000	1587000	The DS itself went actually just within a week,
1587000	1590000	sold 153,834 units.
1590000	1592000	That was pretty cool.
1592000	1596000	This is the last week, fiscal week, I should say.
1596000	1600000	For the Wii, it actually made it up to 73,938,
1600000	1604000	thanks to some of the really cool games that are out.
1604000	1608000	PSP, no real game success.
1608000	1612000	They've sold 33,715 units.
1612000	1615000	PS3, 21,231 units.
1615000	1617000	Numbers, numbers, numbers.
1617000	1618000	What does it all mean, though?
1618000	1622000	I'd say one of the biggest sellers were Everybody's Golf 5.
1622000	1623000	Huh.
1623000	1624000	Which is a game that's not even out here yet, right?
1624000	1625000	No.
1625000	1626000	Interesting.
1626000	1634000	Other games that were giving the PS2 a boost were J-League winning 11, 2007.
1634000	1641000	But the poor Xbox 360, poor baby, only 2,445.
1641000	1642000	Poor, poor baby.
1642000	1643000	Wait, 2,000?
1643000	1644000	Yeah.
1644000	1645000	Xbox 360s or regular Xboxes?
1645000	1648000	They don't like Xbox 360.
1648000	1649000	No, that can't be right.
1649000	1650000	There's got to be more than that.
1650000	1651000	Blue Dragon sold more copies than that.
1651000	1652000	My apologies.
1652000	1653000	Maybe it's regular Xboxes.
1653000	1654000	It must be regular.
1654000	1656000	No, it says Xbox 360.
1656000	1659000	Or in the last month.
1659000	1661000	I call shenanigans.
1661000	1662000	Probably the last one.
1662000	1664000	I'm hoping a typo then, because...
1664000	1667000	Yeah, it's got to be Xbox, regular Xboxes or something.
1667000	1668000	It says Xbox 360, but...
1668000	1669000	I think it's crap.
1669000	1671000	But it says it's based on region, so...
1671000	1672000	Alright.
1672000	1678000	Anyways, if you want to contribute to those wonderful sales numbers, there's going to
1678000	1682000	be some good stuff coming out this week, especially in the US.
1682000	1687480	Starting off, if you're a fan of golf, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 will be coming out on PlayStation
1687480	1694200	2, PlayStation 3, 360, Wii, and PSP, along with the DS, I believe.
1694200	1700720	And also, Stuntman Ignition is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 this
1700720	1701720	week.
1701720	1704360	It's actually a pretty fun driving game.
1704360	1710640	If you're into some role-playing games, Wild Arms 5 is coming out on PlayStation 2.
1710640	1716520	Also on Xbox 360, we have Blue Dragon making its way out.
1716520	1721800	Let's see here, you happen to be looking forward to Dynasty Warriors, Dynasty Warriors Gundam
1721800	1722800	on PlayStation...
1722800	1727760	Or, I'm sorry, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 will be coming out this week.
1727760	1736800	Other games to note, MotoGP 2007 on the 360, Warhawk on the PlayStation 3, as well as Lair.
1736800	1741840	Lair is going to be coming out on the 30th, so they kind of bumped it up a week.
1741840	1749720	And let's see, on PC, Left Behind Eternal Forces, the game has been getting some controversy
1749720	1750720	there.
1750720	1756760	As well as the Guild Wars expansion is going to be making its way out, Eyes of the North.
1756760	1763800	And let's see here, also on the Wii, we've got Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, as well as
1763800	1770520	Brunswick Pro Bowling, which is supposed to be also coming out on PlayStation 2 and PSP,
1770520	1771520	I believe.
1771520	1772520	Okay.
1772520	1775520	Are any of those games something you guys are picking up?
1775520	1779800	I definitely will probably pick up Blue Dragon, even though the demo is kind of eh.
1779800	1782180	And I'll probably pick up Metroid Prime as well.
1782180	1783280	I'm going to be gone most of the week.
1783280	1789360	I'm holding off on Blue Dragon, because I think I might get a copy anyways.
1789360	1791240	This one was also interesting, I forgot to mention it.
1791240	1795120	On PSP, they've got three games that are pretty cool.
1795120	1798280	Deadhead Fred, which looked pretty cool.
1798280	1805240	And then Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes, and Monster Hunter Freedom 2 looked actually pretty
1805240	1806240	good.
1806240	1808960	Are you going to get any of those games, Dark Saga?
1808960	1812420	Probably Blue Dragon, but I'll just get down to rent whatever I want first.
1812420	1813420	Buy before you buy.
1813420	1814420	Exactly.
1814420	1815420	Alright.
1815420	1817960	Moving on to the Japanese release dates, and what's going on over there.
1817960	1824400	Hitman Blood Money finally comes out in Japan this week on August 30th on the Xbox 360.
1824400	1829600	Blade Storm, The Hundred Years War coming out on the PlayStation 3 also this week in
1829600	1830600	Japan.
1830600	1834240	$95 if you want to import that sucker into the US.
1834240	1838080	Long time listeners of our program probably are interested in this release on the PlayStation
1838080	1839080	2.
1839080	1845540	Mania 2DX 13th Distorted is coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week.
1845540	1852680	And also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Jintama Jinsan Toishiboku no Kabuki Machiniki.
1852680	1855120	I love the long, long Japanese titles.
1855120	1857980	It's an action game, but I don't know, the screenshots of this game look like it has
1857980	1862880	an awful lot of cinematics for being a little bit of an action game.
1862880	1867800	Another game coming out on the PlayStation 2 for Marvelous Entertainment, Katai Kiyoshi
1867800	1872900	Hitman Reborn, Dream Hyper Battle, another action game coming out there on the PlayStation
1872900	1874160	2.
1874160	1879280	Coming out also on the PlayStation 2, Yoki Haim Denn in limited edition and regular formats,
1879280	1882160	an adventure game coming to you from Idea Factory.
1882160	1886880	And my favorite title of the week, love it, love it, love it, Nintendo DS will see the
1886880	1892620	release of Love Cat Life will be coming out on the Nintendo DS, and here's the best part.
1892620	1898240	If you look at the box art, it is a complete and utter ripoff of Nintendogs, because you
1898240	1902760	have the cute little kitties there on the box art, and then it says Love Cat Life written
1902760	1903760	in that same format.
1903760	1904760	Rob.
1904760	1905760	Rob.
1905760	1906760	Rob.
1906760	1907760	Rob.
1907760	1908760	Rob.
1908760	1909760	What?
1909760	1910760	Rob.
1910760	1911760	You want?
1911760	1912760	Rob, give me baby kitties.
1912760	1913760	I can has Love Cat Life?
1913760	1914760	I want Love Cat Life.
1914760	1915760	Love Cat Life needs to come out over here so I can play with the kitties.
1915760	1916760	Although I want-
1916760	1917760	Look, the cats sing.
1917760	1919320	There's a singing competition for the cats.
1919320	1920320	They sing.
1920320	1921320	Yes.
1921320	1923800	I think you play the, I think you play with them.
1923800	1926960	This game looks like a complete ripoff of Nintendogs in every way except for this cat.
1926960	1928520	The doggies don't sing.
1928520	1929520	That's a good thing.
1929520	1933560	Then there's, look, there's a cat rolling around in a toy truck, a little toy dump truck.
1933560	1934560	I want to see.
1934560	1935560	I want to see.
1935560	1936560	That's so cute.
1936560	1937560	And let's see here.
1937560	1940680	A cat looking angry at the food that's been placed in front of them.
1940680	1941680	I want to see.
1941680	1942680	I'm sorry.
1942680	1946160	I will post, since I know this makes for great radio, at least for the live folks, I will
1946160	1948160	copy and paste that into chat so you can take a look at the game.
1948160	1950800	Jeremy makes that face all the time.
1950800	1954240	And now you know why.
1954240	1955360	I don't like this food.
1955360	1958400	Wake me up when they have lolcats the game.
1958400	1959680	They should totally make lolcats the game.
1959680	1964760	Dude, there are so many fucking animal sim games coming out this fall.
1964760	1966640	It's not even funny.
1966640	1969240	I'm looking at the chat room.
1969240	1972920	D.V. says they should make Nintend ferrets.
1972920	1975000	Karpakin says no ferret games to be found.
1975000	1977200	Didn't that come up a couple weeks ago on the show?
1977200	1978200	There are ferret games.
1978200	1981800	I found one and it was on the Nintendo, on the Game Boy.
1981800	1984160	But it wasn't the ferret a supporting character or something?
1984160	1986000	No, it was a ferret game.
1986000	1987000	Let's see.
1987000	1989640	Gold Banjo said Nintendog clones were doomed to happen.
1989640	1991520	Yes, and they have been happening.
1991520	1994320	There was that cats with a Z and dogs with a Z we had here.
1994320	1996680	But seriously, go look at the box art for this game.
1996680	2001880	It's a complete freaking ripoff of Nintendogs, but that's not a bad thing.
2001880	2005080	Here's some of them that I can't remember off the top of my head.
2005080	2011240	Gold Pets with a Z. Dolphins, yes, you can have pet dolphins.
2011240	2014800	Imagine Babies, that's a pet baby sim.
2014800	2017880	I kid you not.
2017880	2025160	Imagine Babies with a Z, by the way, because it's edgy.
2025160	2027320	There's Puppy Love coming out for the Wii.
2027320	2029840	I remember that one.
2029840	2034200	Was it Pets, Dogs, and Cats, and Hamster Life 2 or whatever?
2034200	2036200	All the sequels to those games from last year.
2036200	2039800	Okay, one of our frequent guests of Orange L'Entre D'O's back tonight, Mink Latov's here,
2039800	2041520	fresh from Taco Bell with food.
2041520	2046360	Thanks for smelling up the crappy food in the room.
2046360	2048760	What did you want to say about Imagine Babies?
2048760	2053880	I wonder if it uses that slide sensor that the Nintendo games in Japan use and you could
2053880	2055360	slide babies around.
2055360	2056680	It's almost like shaking them.
2056680	2060360	It'd be so awesome.
2060360	2063120	Imagine not having babies if you actually buy this game.
2063120	2064520	I imagine it all the time.
2064520	2070240	The Imagine Babies series or the Imagine series, I guess, is games meant for girls.
2070240	2076520	So they have, I kid you not, they have the babies, they have fashion designer, they have
2076520	2082600	a chef, because women need to cook, and then they also had, what was the other one that
2082600	2083600	they had that was hilarious?
2083600	2084600	Oh, pet doctor.
2084600	2090480	I'm thinking my head hurt even more.
2090480	2095120	I understand now because women should cook, take care of the animals, and have babies.
2095120	2097280	That sounds like a perfect line up to me.
2097280	2102320	See, now it's a bummer the webcam isn't working right now because Dark Soccer is giving me
2102320	2103320	the finger.
2103320	2104320	Thank you.
2104320	2105320	Appreciate it.
2105320	2106320	Yes, the webcam broke.
2106320	2107320	I hit it with a mallet.
2107320	2108320	I screwed up.
2108320	2109320	That's a secret.
2109320	2112000	I hit it with my evil power.
2112000	2113240	So how about the UK, Rob?
2113240	2114620	How about the UK?
2114620	2116120	It's awesome.
2116120	2118120	Like a hot dog.
2118120	2121280	Coming out on the 28th.
2121280	2123400	What if I don't like hot dogs?
2123400	2125840	Then too after you.
2125840	2129160	The only type of hot dogs I like are the Costco hot dogs.
2129160	2130600	The Hebrew International ones.
2130600	2131600	Those are really good.
2131600	2132600	Those are the bomb.
2132600	2133600	Anyway, sorry.
2133600	2136560	When we used to work over there.
2136560	2137560	You know what?
2137560	2139400	Let's leave Orange Lounge Radio and create the hot dog podcast.
2139400	2141400	That would be awesome.
2141400	2146120	No, because they are made of lips and thighs.
2146120	2147120	Ew.
2147120	2153840	Anyway, on the 28th we have Warhawk on PS3, yay.
2153840	2161840	On the 31st we have Blazing Angels Secret Mission, Boogie, Dragon Ball Z Goku Densetsu,
2161840	2170960	Guild Wars Eye of the North, Stuntman Ignition on PS2 and Xbox 360, Tales of the World Radiant
2170960	2177360	Mythology on PSP, Tamagotchi Party On, why are there still Tamagotchi games?
2177360	2179520	Tamagotchi party off, please.
2179520	2180520	Jeez.
2180520	2182000	Tamagotchi party's over.
2182000	2183000	Go home.
2183000	2185080	Although, you know what I found when I was cleaning, Rob?
2185080	2186080	What?
2186080	2187080	I found my old Digimon.
2187080	2188080	Did you really?
2188080	2190080	Oh my God, that's awful.
2190080	2194680	Loki, can you paste that artwork in chat so we chatters can see it?
2194680	2195680	I will do that.
2195680	2199640	Loki found the artwork for Imagine Babies, and I swear to God it looks like a Sears catalog
2199640	2206840	photo of this young girl, who can't be more than like 19, holding a young baby who looks
2206840	2208600	to be about four years old.
2208600	2210480	That's a big fucking baby.
2210480	2213040	That's more like an eight month old baby, Rob.
2213040	2218040	The baby's as big as she is, and the baby doesn't even like, imagine that popping out
2218040	2219840	of your you-know-wheres.
2219840	2220840	That's going to hurt.
2220840	2221840	And guess what?
2221840	2226880	Shane, you'll be happy to know that you can rock the baby, so therefore you can shake
2226880	2228280	the baby.
2228280	2231920	Loki, you need to get us a copy of this game for show research.
2231920	2232920	I will do that.
2232920	2234760	Rob wants to raise babies.
2234760	2235760	That's right.
2235760	2239800	See, now that we have the Operator 11 stuff, we can have these video shows of us playing
2239800	2240800	Imagine Babies.
2240800	2241800	It'll be fun.
2241800	2242800	No.
2242800	2243800	Super Metroid for the win.
2243800	2246000	I did Super Metroid as a test show tonight.
2246000	2248280	That's the one thing that's on stream right now.
2248280	2249280	It's hot.
2249280	2250280	Well then, can I finish reading the games?
2250280	2251280	Oh, sorry.
2251280	2252280	Because you distracted me with crap.
2252280	2253280	Sorry, my bad.
2253280	2259720	Um, only one more game on the 31st, we have Worms Open Warfare 2 on PSP and DS, another
2259720	2266120	franchise that, while entertaining while it was new, needs to have that nail in the coffin.
2266120	2268400	Or at least a chainsaw through the coffin.
2268400	2270960	That's it.
2270960	2271960	All done?
2271960	2272960	Africa.
2272960	2273960	You sure?
2273960	2274960	You done?
2274960	2275960	You sure you're finished?
2275960	2276960	My head hurts.
2276960	2277960	Leave me alone.
2277960	2278960	Imagine Africa.
2278960	2279960	Not sucking.
2279960	2280960	Alright.
2280960	2281960	Ow.
2281960	2287200	Um, so, yeah.
2287200	2291420	If you don't want to buy something and you want to kind of play a demo of it, there's
2291420	2298320	a brand new demo for Folklore that's finally made its way out from Japan to both Europe
2298320	2300200	and the US.
2300200	2301740	And I've talked about this before.
2301740	2302740	It's an awesome demo.
2302740	2303740	You should check it out.
2303740	2307680	You actually pull the souls of creatures out of their bodies and fight with them.
2307680	2311640	I didn't like that game, but I didn't understand what the hell was going on when you were playing
2311640	2312640	it.
2312640	2316360	Now that it's in English, it should be a little bit easier to understand, and of course the
2316360	2321400	full game is coming out early October, so check it out.
2321400	2325160	It's finally nice to see that there's something to download to the Playstation 3.
2325160	2326160	Hooray.
2326160	2329800	Well, I know one game a lot of you folks on the Playstation 3 are looking forward to is
2329800	2331560	the game Lair.
2331560	2338840	And the president of Factor 5, who is creating this game Lair, Julian Egbrecht, gave a very
2338840	2343320	interesting speech at the recent Leipzig conference going on in Germany.
2343320	2350540	This developer called the ESRB standards and practices a bizarre system, and also called
2350540	2353960	Lair's certification process a charade.
2353960	2358200	And he said that in order to be approved for a teen rating, they had to cut out a lot of
2358200	2363440	the blood originally that was in the game, but burning bodies, screaming burning bodies,
2363440	2365200	that was okay.
2365200	2371520	And Egbrecht went on to kind of say, hey, the MPAA's equivalent rating for movies, PG-13,
2371520	2375240	permits this much bigger spectrum of violence.
2375240	2380000	Apparently the ESRB has a taboo against sex in games, especially if you're talking about
2380000	2386320	homosexuals, and is basically trying to get developers to band together against the ESRB.
2386320	2389360	Push the violence, push the sex, but push it in an artistic way.
2389360	2391920	Show that games are art.
2391920	2395880	Interesting little cheer call from the Lair developer.
2395880	2398540	Maybe he's trying to get people to buy Lair to support his cause, I don't know, but Lair
2398540	2400200	looks kind of fun, actually.
2400200	2403160	More games need more butt sex.
2403160	2404400	You want more butt sex in games?
2404400	2405480	Surprise butt sex in games.
2405480	2407280	I don't know about that.
2407280	2409680	All right.
2409680	2413360	So that's all I've got to say on Lair.
2413360	2415560	I have things to say on other stuff.
2415560	2416760	Imagine that.
2416760	2418520	I always have things to say.
2418520	2419520	Imagine.
2419520	2420520	Jamie not having anything to say.
2420520	2423040	Hey Rob, you know what, shut up.
2423040	2429800	I'll have you know real quick, there's a ton of funny, imagine, fake box arts that people
2429800	2430800	have done.
2430800	2434520	Like imagine a whore in a bed.
2434520	2438120	Imagine all my fucking god kittens and domestic violence.
2438120	2441100	Imagine if you don't eat, everyone will love you.
2441100	2445840	Is imagine whore in a bed the prequel to imagine babies?
2445840	2452600	No, because the whore just has a bunch of them and she donates them to science.
2452600	2455920	Wait, that didn't pick up my mic.
2455920	2457080	Imagine abortions.
2457080	2459860	You could totally use the stylus in creative ways.
2459860	2461720	How about imagine abstinence?
2461720	2463880	Imagine the next story right now.
2463880	2465320	Hey Rob.
2465320	2466320	What?
2466320	2473120	Anyway, so the PSP's on demand video service is out in Europe in 2008.
2473120	2474480	Isn't that amazing?
2474480	2476080	It's called Go.
2476080	2478080	So you just go.
2478080	2479600	Hey Jamie.
2479600	2480600	Go.
2480600	2481600	Go.
2481600	2482600	No.
2482600	2483600	Imagine going.
2483600	2489000	Is that going to be like our new end joke that we're just going to beat into the ground?
2489000	2490000	It's already been done.
2490000	2492440	I hate to tell you, it's over.
2492440	2493440	Walk away.
2493440	2495560	So, what's the big deal about this?
2495560	2498280	It's a video download service.
2498280	2502720	It will have a rich selection of high quality entertainment, so it says.
2502720	2505320	Can I watch Lost on it?
2505320	2510040	It's basically in conjunction with Sky's On Demand video.
2510040	2512760	So no, you won't be able to watch Lost on it because you're not in the UK.
2512760	2513760	Yeah, Rob.
2513760	2514760	Oh.
2514760	2515760	You can pretend.
2515760	2518720	Well, can I travel to the UK and download Lost and then come back over here and watch
2518720	2520400	it?
2520400	2526360	Only if you live in the UK and can pay for it in the UK and all that.
2526360	2528880	GS68 in our chat room sums it up really well.
2528880	2529880	He says, stop imagining.
2529880	2530880	There you have.
2530880	2533600	GS68 also wants to know, can I watch porn on it?
2533600	2535800	Will there be porn on the On Demand service?
2535800	2538400	It just says entertainment.
2538400	2539400	Adult entertainment?
2539400	2541600	So maybe it's like the Fapperama channel.
2541600	2542600	I don't know.
2542600	2544640	That porn older we tonight, 13, 12.
2544640	2548080	That porn On Demand service that you're looking for is called the web browser.
2548080	2549080	Oh, okay.
2549080	2550080	Thank you.
2550080	2551960	It said this would be like sports movies.
2551960	2552960	Rated E for everyone.
2552960	2553960	Tunes.
2553960	2554960	That type of stuff.
2554960	2555960	All right.
2555960	2558760	Well, hooray for the On Demand video service, I suppose.
2558760	2559760	And porn.
2559760	2562200	It would probably be like skin and axe level.
2562200	2563680	Not very interesting porn.
2563680	2565320	Well, guess what?
2565320	2570480	There is something else that kind of go along with the other Go thing.
2570480	2574680	Go Messenger, because I have to say that that way because there is an exclamation point
2574680	2580160	in the middle of the word there, is a PSP, I mean, voice and video chat service that
2580160	2584040	will be available also in Europe.
2584040	2585040	And apparently...
2585040	2591160	Wait, is there a webcam already out in Europe for you to use with the Go Messenger service?
2591160	2598240	Yes, actually it's called the Go Cam and it's going to be available pretty soon here.
2598240	2604040	I think some of this stuff is coming over here, but not the Go Messenger.
2604040	2609640	So the Go service not only has Messenger, voice chat, video chat, but it also has movies
2609640	2612440	On Demand.
2612440	2617080	So it's like an all-in-one thing this Go service has.
2617080	2619080	Is that what you're saying, Loki?
2619080	2620080	Yes.
2620080	2621080	All right.
2621080	2623680	RoboBoy430 in chat wins with this comment.
2623680	2627080	Agents are Go!
2627080	2628720	Get it?
2628720	2629720	Get it?
2629720	2632080	It wasn't a PSP joke, I'll give you that.
2632080	2634520	Rob, I need Vicodin to finish the show.
2634520	2636840	I might have some.
2636840	2640080	Moving on with other things that Sony has been talking about, this time for the PlayStation
2640080	2641080	3.
2641080	2642080	Guess what?
2642080	2647400	There is a DVR service coming to the PlayStation 3 and this as well is coming to Europe.
2647400	2648400	It's called Play TV.
2648400	2654120	It's going to have two high definition tuners and you can record and play various free TV
2654120	2657980	channels and there's also the standard definition support.
2657980	2662680	It's going to also use the PSP's remote play features so you can watch live TV and record
2662680	2666800	TV programs remotely on your PSP over a Wi-Fi connection.
2666800	2671040	It's going to be first available in the UK, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain with more
2671040	2673080	PAL territories to follow.
2673080	2677640	Finally, a reason to have such a big hard drive on the PlayStation 3, yes?
2677640	2681280	Well in Europe, I'm still waiting for an excuse over here.
2681280	2683520	Don't you think that it's inevitable this will come out here though or do you think
2683520	2684800	they're like testing it in Europe?
2684800	2689120	They're not going to because there's no standardized digital service over here.
2689120	2690120	D'oh.
2690120	2693920	So until that happens, we'll still be waiting.
2693920	2694920	Never.
2694920	2696720	Well couldn't they team up with one service?
2696720	2700020	Kind of like, didn't Xbox 360 team up with that new AT&T service?
2700020	2704720	I don't know, but I would think if they're going to do a digital service, do like a satellite
2704720	2710840	service, because that's supposedly all digital, but I don't know.
2710840	2711840	All right.
2711840	2716320	Well also, all digital every week is Dark Sakura's mailbag segment.
2716320	2717320	Yay.
2717320	2721200	Now, last week we had to skip the mailbag segment because of the stupid live 365 downtime
2721200	2725160	and all that stuff that was going on and also we just didn't have a lot of mail last week
2725160	2729760	so I said please email us and did the listeners email us this week?
2729760	2731560	Do we get lots and lots of emails?
2731560	2732560	Yup.
2732560	2733560	Hooray.
2733560	2734560	So we have a nice mailbag segment for you guys tonight.
2734560	2738680	Of course, you can always interact with us by sending mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com
2738680	2742300	your emails and Dark Sakura will open up the mailbag and read some of her favorites so
2742300	2743300	let's go to it.
2743300	2746520	Reach in the mailbag and pull something out.
2746520	2748640	What's there this week, Dark Sakura?
2748640	2751000	Some stuff.
2751000	2753760	The first of the emails, dun dun dun.
2753760	2757800	Hey guys, I really like your idea about picking a game and playing it on air.
2757800	2763240	You gotta have the game audio on there somehow, especially since Sakura has all the systems.
2763240	2766040	Have a vote of what games everyone wants you to play each week.
2766040	2768920	You could even replace the FUs of the week with it.
2768920	2769920	Pendragon.
2769920	2775040	Um, no, I need my FUs, but thank you for the idea.
2775040	2778760	Dear OLR, listening to your ideas for games coming from old movies, I feel compelled to
2778760	2782520	suggest that several of these studios get together and make a Smash Bros. or Capcom
2782520	2787000	vs. SNK styled fighting game which brings the protagonists from these old classics together
2787000	2789560	to beat the ever-loving crap out of each other.
2789560	2794000	Specifically, I wish to see Ewoks fighting the alien cat from the cat from outer space.
2794000	2795400	Perhaps also Skeletor.
2795400	2796400	That is all.
2796400	2797400	Warrior Bob.
2797400	2798400	Warrior Bob is great.
2798400	2800400	He's so much fun to hang out with.
2800400	2805040	I was going to say, backing up to the last email real quick, thanks to our new thingy
2805040	2809760	on Operator 11, that is definitely a possibility and that was all done on the laptop so I can
2809760	2813560	haul that thing over to Jamie's house and we can have ourselves some turbo graphics
2813560	2816600	playing broadcast so we are going to look into doing that in the future.
2816600	2817600	Yes, Jamie?
2817600	2818600	Yes.
2818600	2819600	This must happen.
2819600	2820600	And it does have the audio.
2820600	2822720	It's not very good that it does have the audio.
2822720	2826280	We could have ways around that with proper editing.
2826280	2827880	There are ways.
2827880	2828960	We have the technology.
2828960	2831160	We can build it.
2831160	2832160	Okay.
2832160	2833160	If you build it, they will come.
2833160	2834160	We'll see.
2834160	2838120	Also, I want to say about the next email, what would you guys want to see in a game
2838120	2839120	like that?
2839120	2841280	A Super Smash Bros. game with movie characters.
2841280	2845120	Chat room, that's open to you guys too, just out of curiosity.
2845120	2846960	Too bad we already have a topic for tonight's List List.
2846960	2847960	This will be a good one.
2847960	2849720	What are you eating?
2849720	2850720	Ice cream.
2850720	2851720	That's what I ran out to get.
2851720	2854200	I want ice cream.
2854200	2855200	Let's see.
2855200	2856200	What characters from movies would be good?
2856200	2859200	How about some of the characters from Kill Bill, of course?
2859200	2860200	Brokeback Mountain, Miklotov?
2860200	2863700	I don't know if that would work.
2863700	2865800	Who would fight in Brokeback Mountain?
2865800	2867400	Would the two guys switch out?
2867400	2869280	There was already a fight in that movie.
2869280	2870280	Was there?
2870280	2871280	Yeah.
2871280	2872280	A little bit.
2872280	2873280	Right?
2873280	2874280	There was...
2874280	2875640	Iron is your special weapon?
2875640	2879520	I got food in my mouth.
2879520	2880960	Anyway, never mind.
2880960	2881960	This is a bad idea.
2881960	2882960	Oh, wait.
2882960	2883960	We got the chat room.
2883960	2884960	Thank God.
2884960	2886440	Kerpokken says, Silent Bob.
2886440	2889080	DJ Dark Knight says, What about Rinky Bobby?
2889080	2891440	Love Nanny Chronic.
2891440	2893800	Black Boy says, Rose McGowan from Planet Terror.
2893800	2895440	There you go.
2895440	2896440	Nice.
2896440	2899080	David Bowie from Labyrinth.
2899080	2902440	With a special sidekick as Crotch.
2902440	2906880	Labyrinth versus Dark Crystal, this must happen.
2906880	2907880	Next email, please.
2907880	2910480	David Bowie as the king of all cosmos.
2910480	2911480	That would work.
2911480	2912480	Oh, my God.
2912480	2917120	He does sort of look like that now, too, doesn't he?
2917120	2919120	He's still hot, though.
2919120	2920120	Greetings.
2920120	2923040	First of all, thanks for providing such an entertaining podcast on a weekly basis.
2923040	2924040	You're welcome.
2924040	2925040	Give me a dollar.
2925040	2926640	Hey, I'm the one who asks for a dollar every week.
2926640	2928040	I listen to it every week.
2928040	2930040	Okay, give me five dollars.
2930040	2934640	If you're not going to share, don't eat in front of us.
2934640	2940080	Oh, never mind, it's caramel, and caramel sucks.
2940080	2942080	I'd rather have a taco.
2942080	2945240	It's dulce de leche, just so you know.
2945240	2946720	Yuck.
2946720	2948480	Read the email, ladies.
2948480	2949960	It's what we pay you to do.
2949960	2951160	Shane's making me laugh.
2951160	2952160	I can't stop.
2952160	2956160	First of all, okay, I already read all that.
2956160	2960800	I listen to it every week, and it makes my drive to work that much more tolerable.
2960800	2961800	Sorry about this week.
2961800	2964800	I hope I didn't run you off the road with- I want to read the email, Rob.
2964800	2965800	I have a bunch of them.
2965800	2966800	I want to interrupt you, Jamie.
2966800	2969800	I want you to kiss my ass, but not.
2969800	2973480	It's fine to follow the email in this conversation.
2973480	2975480	No, it is not.
2975480	2976480	Shane said it was on the email.
2976480	2977480	It is not.
2977480	2978480	A little background.
2978480	2980160	I have been playing video games for over 28 years.
2980160	2985120	I am now 35 and have a family, which probably is a little different from your main audience.
2985120	2988640	I also recognize that a lot of the places you guys describe because I'm a Bay Area person
2988640	2989640	as well.
2989640	2993000	Anywho, I will try to keep this short, famous last words.
2993000	2996360	And I don't think you quite accomplished that, but oh well.
2996360	3000240	Regarding the discussion of Red Rings on Xbox 360, I completely understand Loki's frustration
3000240	3005720	in regards to some fans or fanboys commenting regarding the failure rate.
3005720	3010500	Countless forums and blogs have perpetuated this 33% failure rate as fact when in reality
3010500	3016440	is merely a number drawn from a tired interview in Australia with some anonymous XEB game
3016440	3017440	employees.
3017440	3018440	Someone's ass.
3018440	3019440	Yeah.
3019440	3024560	While I wouldn't care if fanboys or other systems believe this themselves, I am irritated
3024560	3028200	when misinformation is spread around and influenced potential buyers to not buy one because of
3028200	3029560	false rumors.
3029560	3033240	Of course, I am in an awkward position actually agreeing with Loki as he tirelessly attacks
3033240	3034240	the Mac.
3034240	3035240	Just kidding.
3035240	3038360	I am a Mac fan, though, and even worked for Apple for a time.
3038360	3042240	Isn't that amazing how many Mac fans we have that stick with this show even though Loki
3042240	3044900	you know, bashes Apple products when he can?
3044900	3045900	Your Mac made me want to die last night.
3045900	3048640	Just because I don't like them doesn't mean you shouldn't like them.
3048640	3051560	I just, I'm giving you my opinion.
3051560	3054480	You're like, well, we should all think like you.
3054480	3055480	Way to be sheep.
3055480	3056480	People, my God.
3056480	3058240	Your Mac made me want to die last night.
3058240	3063080	You know, if you didn't challenge my opinion, then you know, you would just be sheep.
3063080	3064640	Why did my Mac make, oh wait, be quiet, Loki.
3064640	3065960	Why did my Mac make you want to die last night?
3065960	3068040	Because you actually need to put AIM on that.
3068040	3069040	Why?
3069040	3070040	Use Meebo.
3070040	3071040	I hate Meebo.
3071040	3072040	I hate you.
3072040	3073040	I hate you back.
3073040	3074040	Email.
3074040	3075040	No.
3075040	3076040	You, you were mean to me, Rob.
3076040	3077040	I'm going to leave now.
3077040	3078040	Bye.
3078040	3079040	Do you want some ice cream?
3079040	3080040	Yuck.
3080040	3081040	What are you trying to do?
3081040	3082040	Make my butt bigger?
3082040	3083040	Well, can I ice cream?
3083040	3084040	Make her read the email.
3084040	3085040	Can I finish reading the email?
3085040	3086040	We'll see.
3086040	3087040	It's Dolce De Leche.
3087040	3088040	Oh, no thanks.
3088040	3089040	What the hell is your people's problem with caramel?
3089040	3090040	It is gross.
3090040	3097040	Anyway, can I finish reading the email?
3097040	3098040	I suppose.
3098040	3099520	Playing online.
3099520	3103040	My question for all of you is how much do you truly enjoy playing with strangers online?
3103040	3105480	Oh, I love strangers.
3105480	3107200	For me, it's a massive turn off.
3107200	3108200	I said that, by the way.
3108200	3114480	No, for me, it's a massive turn off to play with immature jerks constantly, so I have
3114480	3116640	set up a small league with people I actually know in person.
3116640	3120440	I rarely ever do any online gaming with strangers anymore.
3120440	3124600	Honestly, I usually just play with people I know either that or I'm like, no, I don't
3124600	3125600	want to fight you.
3125600	3126600	Shut up.
3126600	3128200	Sometimes I play World of Warcraft.
3128200	3129200	Sometimes.
3129200	3130200	Keep up the good work, guys.
3130200	3132280	Dark Charger.
3132280	3135040	I don't like to play with strangers online either.
3135040	3139560	My mommy told me not to talk to strangers, especially on Xbox Live.
3139560	3144880	Once in a great while, I will, but I totally use that feedback feature if I have to.
3144880	3145880	So.
3145880	3146880	Okay.
3146880	3150360	And which I will not read online as per your request.
3150360	3151360	Thank you for your PS.
3151360	3152360	Oh, yes.
3152360	3153360	I saw that too.
3153360	3157200	I'm a rat, especially since, well, my other hobbies.
3157200	3158200	Ah, fair dear.
3158200	3159200	Yes.
3159200	3160200	My other hobbies.
3160200	3161200	Anyway.
3161200	3162200	Nice email.
3162200	3163200	Porn.
3163200	3166840	This is from Robert M. Just two quick thoughts.
3166840	3172200	One, I almost hope Uwe Boll announces plans to make a movie based on Manhunt and is immediately
3172200	3174040	sued by You Know Who.
3174040	3177480	That particular clash of personalities would likely end in destruction of the career of
3177480	3181520	one or both, seeing how neither would back down prior to that point.
3181520	3191960	Secondly, I was wondering if HMMJDS has only songs from the Disney show or the Hannah Montana
3191960	3196200	game or stuff from the average non-fan of the show would recognize.
3196200	3200680	According to IGN, it does allow you to create your own music tracks, nothing about songless
3200680	3204280	though or if play to the present music is even an option.
3204280	3206080	I don't know, but I'll try to find out.
3206080	3208600	I'd be surprised if it weren't.
3208600	3210480	And apparently, oh yeah.
3210480	3214480	Is Footy Monster, our resident Hannah Montana fan in chat tonight?
3214480	3216480	I do see he is, so maybe he can answer that.
3216480	3218160	I don't know.
3218160	3224120	Nobody loves Hannah Montana more than Footy Monster.
3224120	3225120	The next email.
3225120	3226120	Hi guys.
3226120	3231520	MeezerCrazy, I guess that's how it's pronounced here.
3231520	3234640	I'm new to your podcast and I think you guys are funny as hell, especially Dark Soccer.
3234640	3235640	You crack me up.
3235640	3236840	Oh, thank you.
3236840	3239160	I crack lots of people up when I have a mallet.
3239160	3244160	Anyway, I was wondering if any of you would know if there are any plans for Nintendo on
3244160	3249120	releasing any Turbografx-16 CD-ROM or Super CD games on the Virtual Console, like Splash
3249120	3250440	Lake, Monster Lair or Dracula X.
3250440	3253200	Oh God, I love you already.
3253200	3256920	Can you think of any Turbo CD games that you'd like to see on the Virtual Console?
3256920	3259700	Thanks and keep up the good work.
3259700	3265040	I'm just going to say MeezerCrazy since he actually put his name in the email.
3265040	3275160	I would love to see the Valis series.
3275160	3281320	It was just one of the regular Sega CD games.
3281320	3283900	I would actually love to see Sapphire.
3283900	3288280	It was a game that was one of the arcade CDs.
3288280	3291720	It was actually one of the first polygon-based shooters.
3291720	3295160	Very, very, very good game.
3295160	3299960	I am by no means an expert on these old CD-based systems, so I will simply say Night Trap and
3299960	3300960	leave it at that.
3300960	3303480	That wasn't even on the Turbografx-16 CD.
3303480	3305040	Well, it should have been.
3305040	3307320	No, because Night Trap kind of sucked ass.
3307320	3311920	Okay, it sucked a lot of ass, but it had Dana Plato in it.
3311920	3316040	But I'd love to see Rondo of Blood out there.
3316040	3319080	I was a little distracted during that previous email because I was trying to talk to Footy
3319080	3322200	Monster in the chat room and heard us say his name on the show, but he was too busy
3322200	3325360	looking at porn to hear what the question was.
3325360	3329400	And Footy Monster did finally, after I clarified with him, he says, it's not known right now
3329400	3333280	what music is in the Hannah Montana game, but I'm guessing it will be from the show.
3333280	3337520	At least that's what the big hairy guy on the stage said.
3337520	3338520	The big hairy guy on the show?
3338520	3340360	In the porn or in the Hannah Montana thing?
3340360	3342040	Just kidding.
3342040	3343780	Okay.
3343780	3344780	More email.
3344780	3346640	God, there's a bunch of really long ones.
3346640	3347640	I can has email?
3347640	3351480	Okay, this one says, call me Surtur.
3351480	3352480	Okay.
3352480	3353880	Hi Surtur.
3353880	3357960	Every Monday morning I wake up and my magical PSP has downloaded the latest OLR podcast.
3357960	3360160	I can listen to it on the way to work.
3360160	3362500	I've been playing Jean Dark.
3362500	3365160	It is a strategy RPG based on the Joan of Arc story.
3365160	3367320	Who says the PSP doesn't have great games?
3367320	3368320	I don't know.
3368320	3369320	I think I've said that before.
3369320	3372080	That would be Shane saying that.
3372080	3373760	Thanks again for the show every week.
3373760	3374760	PSP sucks.
3374760	3376160	Doesn't have good games.
3376160	3377160	You were just playing Silent Hill.
3377160	3378160	I know.
3378160	3379560	Back that shit up.
3379560	3380840	Is it out yet?
3380840	3381840	No.
3381840	3382840	It does not have good games.
3382840	3386920	PSP has a very bright future for it though and a lot of that is thanks to Konami because
3386920	3395720	of Silent Hill Origins, the Metal Gear game is great and the Castlevania, what the hell
3395720	3396720	is it called?
3396720	3399720	Akumajo Chronicles or whatever the shit that thing was.
3399720	3400720	Yeah.
3400720	3402120	Rondo of blah blah blah.
3402120	3403120	Alright.
3403120	3404120	And Brooktown.
3404120	3405120	And Brooktown?
3405120	3406120	No.
3406120	3407120	No Brooktown.
3407120	3408120	No Brooktown.
3408120	3409120	K Kland.
3409120	3410120	Alright.
3410120	3411120	Anyway.
3411120	3412540	Hello, this is Kripatkin from Kripatkin and Hendrick's Game Review Show.
3412540	3413540	That's cool.
3413540	3414540	Hi.
3414540	3415540	He's in our chat room tonight.
3415540	3417880	And that's the show that's sandwiched in between us when we have our rebroadcast on
3417880	3418880	all games.
3418880	3419880	That's hot.
3419880	3420880	Yes.
3420880	3424440	I've been listening to your shows, well, Shavvling 2 and FromWhere, picture of my place
3424440	3425440	of work is below.
3425440	3426440	Okay.
3426440	3429880	The email that we use is non HTML, so sorry.
3429880	3431040	Nope.
3431040	3435160	And thought I'd drop you a line considering the lack of email you've been getting recently.
3435160	3441780	I'm going to skip on past the location stuff because it says I can't show it.
3441780	3445840	You know, since this email is coming from a British listener, I think you should read
3445840	3446840	this in an accent.
3446840	3447840	No.
3447840	3453360	No, I'm not, because I'm tired, and I have a concussion.
3453360	3455840	I think you should read it within a spot of accents.
3455840	3457160	I don't care if you have a concussion.
3457160	3458160	Oh, no.
3458160	3460120	So, yes, my email topic.
3460120	3462720	What do you think is going to...
3462720	3471840	I don't care how you read it, just read the damn email.
3471840	3472840	Excuse me, Shane.
3472840	3473840	Hi.
3473840	3474840	Then remove him from the studio.
3474840	3477960	This is horrible radio.
3477960	3479960	Tell Shane to shush.
3479960	3482480	Shane shush email now.
3482480	3484800	Okay, where was I?
3484800	3486840	So, yes, my email topic.
3486840	3490920	What do you think it's going to take to stop the gaming industry focus on the six-week
3490920	3493600	window at the end of the year to sell games?
3493600	3498320	This year is just chronic for making, sorry, chronic for amazing titles being squeezed
3498320	3500160	into this short period of time.
3500160	3503800	Just to give you an idea of how bad it is this year, take a look at the list.
3503800	3509180	Super Paper Mario, not out in Europe yet, Metro Prime, and Metro, Metroid Prime 3, Super
3509180	3515600	Mario Galaxy, Halo 3, PGR4, Assassin's Creed, Crysis, Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Mass Effect,
3515600	3519560	Call of Duty 4, Unreal Tournament 3, Ratchet and Clank, Tools of Destruction, World in
3519560	3526280	Haze, Heavenly Sword, Medal of Honor, Airborne, SEGA Rally, Lost Odyssey, Ace Combat 6, Jericho,
3526280	3528480	Enemy Territory, Quake Wars, Two Worlds.
3528480	3531840	Do you remember a game called Beyond Good and Evil?
3531840	3534000	It was a great game that appeared in Autumn of 2003.
3534000	3537120	I do remember that game actually.
3537120	3541360	It was buried by many other less entertaining titles and undeservedly ended up in the bargain
3541360	3542520	bin.
3542520	3547360	Makes one wonder which out of the games will suffer a familiar fate.
3547360	3551040	As I ask you and the rest of the OLR team, when is the gaming industry going to wake
3551040	3556960	up and realize that the video games can be released year round and not just near Christmas
3556960	3557960	time?
3557960	3562420	For what it's worth, my view on it is that when people stop seeing video games as only
3562420	3569880	being for children games, will cease to be holiday only sale.
3569880	3572320	Sadly, I don't see that attitude changing anytime soon.
3572320	3574760	Holy nuts, the almighty coin.
3574760	3577640	It's Christmas, if they moved Christmas then they could have...
3577640	3579320	Just keep up the good work.
3579320	3580960	Seriously, I mean...
3580960	3582960	It's money, all money.
3582960	3587720	It's development cycles I think, but no, if you look at it, of course they want to try
3587720	3590320	to get as many sales in before their fiscal years are up.
3590320	3595160	That's why you see both Christmas and March as big times for games.
3595160	3599600	Just look at, right now of course since I sell games at work and stuff, we work on order
3599600	3601120	forms and that kind of thing.
3601120	3609640	For August it was three pages long, for October it's about ten to eleven pages long, and November
3609640	3612400	I'm guessing probably around fifteen pages long.
3612400	3617520	So that kind of gives you an idea of how much stuff is coming out and it just gets lumped
3617520	3625520	into that week wherever the fifteenth of November falls and then after that drops down to nothing.
3625520	3629800	So it's more of the fault of the soccer moms of America than the gaming industry necessarily,
3629800	3630800	right?
3630800	3633560	The one day craziness.
3633560	3639000	But I mean if a good game was released in April, or what's a dead month for gaming?
3639000	3640840	April is super dead.
3640840	3646080	Okay, if a good game is released in April, I mean shouldn't that still translate to good
3646080	3648160	sales for the company year round, right?
3648160	3652840	Yeah, I mean look at, well this April there was Super Paper Mario and Guitar Hero 2 on
3652840	3657000	the 360, and those games sold awesome.
3657000	3664280	Another example of a slow month July, there was NCAA Football 08, and NASCAR.
3664280	3666480	It's Mario Strikers I guess.
3666480	3668920	But other than that there wasn't a whole lot.
3668920	3673840	I mean there's times now during the summer it's like, well shit, there's nothing I really
3673840	3678820	want to play for a while, whereas in the fall it's like, crap, there's too much stuff, I
3678820	3681440	don't know what I want to play.
3681440	3686280	People aren't going to spend more money towards fall on games.
3686280	3691480	I think if they just spread out their releases all year long, it might be better for them.
3691480	3695560	Although there are some companies that do that, I mean look at Microsoft and Nintendo,
3695560	3697120	they do spread out their releases.
3697120	3701880	They have about a new game coming out each month, a big AAA game I guess.
3701880	3706360	Well still UT made a good point that Dead Rising came out in March and did very well.
3706360	3708040	Dead Rising came out in August.
3708040	3709040	Really?
3709040	3710040	I thought.
3710040	3712560	No, I don't remember it coming out late.
3712560	3717000	Regardless, there's a couple good games that do come out off cycle every year, no matter
3717000	3718960	what the specifics are.
3718960	3722000	But I was going to say, to me though, games really aren't doing anything different than
3722000	3723000	movies and music.
3723000	3727640	I mean look at the movie industry, all the big movies are always out in the summertime.
3727640	3729560	And then when do all the crap movies come out?
3729560	3733980	After Christmas, like January, February is when, well, sometimes you have the Oscar movies
3733980	3736060	trying to push for awards or whatever.
3736060	3740660	But you know, there's a lot of dead, the same kind of cycle, because when do the consumers
3740660	3744220	buy most of their movies during the summer when the kids aren't in school, right?
3744220	3745640	And then same thing with CDs.
3745640	3748080	CDs follow a very similar pattern to video games.
3748080	3752240	All the big CDs come out, what, September, October, November, up to the Christmas season,
3752240	3756800	and then when you get into January, it's a dead month for the CD and music releases.
3756800	3761000	So of course I'm not sure how online distribution changes all that, if at all, but just kind
3761000	3762000	of something to think about.
3762000	3763880	Dead Rising was August 9th, 2006.
3763880	3768200	Okay, I don't, then what did it say March for?
3768200	3769200	It doesn't matter.
3769200	3770200	Well, anyway.
3770200	3772640	Shall I move on to another email?
3772640	3773640	If you must.
3773640	3777660	Dear OLR crew, after listening live last week, I went and downloaded the podcast and heard
3777660	3779880	all the praise for Bioshock go-around.
3779880	3784120	If Rob was so convinced to buy it, even though he wasn't a first person shooter kind of guy,
3784120	3786360	then by golly, it's something I need to take a look at.
3786360	3790360	I went and plugged down $200 on a video card the next day and stuck it in my computer,
3790360	3793520	and the first thing I did was go and download the Bioshock demo.
3793520	3794520	Friggin' amazing.
3794520	3799000	I need this game right now of the paychecks not being till the end of the month.
3799000	3800000	Preclude this.
3800000	3801240	Thanks to Rob for convincing me.
3801240	3804560	The only complaint I have is the movement is a little sluggish for my taste, reminiscent
3804560	3806360	of playing Halo on the PC.
3806360	3809680	I was looking for that run button everywhere.
3809680	3814060	On the 360, because of the awkwardness of dual analog input, I imagine this allows for
3814060	3818520	more precision, but I guess I just like my games at faster pace.
3818520	3822560	I thought the atmosphere was amazing, with the voices and footsteps signaling there was
3822560	3824080	something out there that you can't see.
3824080	3825600	Chilled me to the bones.
3825600	3829760	Of course, my friend who's a complete Counter-Strike addict played the demo and said, I can hear
3829760	3832520	them from a mile away, and if they didn't make any noise, it'd be scarier when they
3832520	3833520	popped out.
3833520	3836240	But I think the thrill of knowing there's something out there and you don't know when
3836240	3840400	or where it'll come from is better than a cheap pop-out monster thrills.
3840400	3845600	I know you guys are Silent Hill fans, so which kind of stimuli gets your adrenaline pumping?
3845600	3865600	Creepy noises and evil things or jump-out-and-scare-the-crap-out-of-you AZHP?
3865600	3892600	I would say that the atmospheric scary is way better than the pop-out-of-nowhere scary,
3892600	3898800	even though in the Silent Hill PSP demo, I did jump a couple times because of the stupid
3898800	3905040	pop-out-of-nowhere sort of scariness, but I feel that's a cheap thrill, whereas the
3905040	3910960	noises and just the atmosphere stuff is way better and you are more rewarded with that.
3910960	3920080	I think I would say that the atmosphere adds to the pop-outs, it makes it even more scary.
3920080	3925160	I tried to play Bioshock PC, but my video card couldn't handle it, cry?
3925160	3934360	I have to say that I prefer the atmosphere set up, I really love psychological type horror.
3934360	3937760	I don't like the shock value things.
3937760	3941560	When people were telling me about Saw and all those, I was like, that just sounds retarded,
3941560	3942560	I don't care.
3942560	3943560	Yeah, that's gross.
3943560	3947320	I don't like Saw, but that's different to me.
3947320	3949960	I don't think that gross is horror.
3949960	3958020	I have seen tragedies that gross fits in with.
3958020	3963800	I think that a good horror movie or game is something that you don't really know it's
3963800	3970000	meant to be scary, I think, where you think it's just situational and then when something
3970000	3974820	completely unexpected happens, not the jumping out, but when you hear the noises and then
3974820	3978200	you think, oh, well, it's going to be this thing and it turns out to be something completely
3978200	3979200	different.
3979200	3982720	It's a twist, especially when it messes with your head.
3982720	3983720	All right.
3983720	3984720	Any more email?
3984720	3985720	We've got a long email segment tonight.
3985720	3986720	Battle Royale was funny, too.
3986720	3987720	Huh?
3987720	3988720	Nothing.
3988720	3992080	I was saying that Battle Royale wasn't scary, it was funny.
3992080	3994520	I think Silence of the Lambs is a way better movie than something like Saw.
3994520	3996160	Silence of the Lambs is really good.
3996160	3997160	But anyway.
3997160	3998160	And Nive.
3998160	4000440	Hey, OLR, it's me, Solar Wing.
4000440	4004160	I can't be in the chat tonight as work frowns upon me using their internet for live radio
4004160	4005440	stream and such.
4005440	4008240	I just wanted to start this off by saying thank you.
4008240	4013160	OLR saved my sanity and possibly me saying something I'd regret.
4013160	4017360	I took a short trip out to Alberta to see some family and go back to my past.
4017360	4019900	Of course, there was the obligatory meeting of the cousins.
4019900	4026160	To describe them, they are blonde valley girls who by some chance of nature have more than
4026160	4031800	one brain cell and can pull high marks out of their pretentious asses.
4031800	4036520	I brought my DS and my PSP, but I couldn't get the meeting out of my head.
4036520	4044920	I was going over what I would say in the morning.
4044920	4047680	Before I do that, I listened to the podcast I'd previously downloaded.
4047680	4055440	I brought 21-odd casts and listened to about 8 for a bit, but I was getting more annoyed.
4055440	4058700	But then I started to listen to your show and I started to calm down.
4058700	4062840	The humor and pacing was perfect for what I needed, which was to calm the hell down.
4062840	4065640	I forgot all about the night and simply enjoyed the show.
4065640	4070400	For that, I'm truly thankful and the only thing that I can suggest is adding the catchphrase
4070400	4075240	vehicular homicide is wrong even if they are your cousins.
4075240	4079960	Vehicular homicide is great, especially if they're your cousins.
4079960	4084200	I don't understand because how is this show calming because this show has me more on edge
4084200	4085200	tonight.
4085200	4087360	I think we're distracting.
4087360	4091360	And if you don't think about the crap that's pissing you off, then maybe you feel better.
4091360	4095360	Because tonight's show makes me want to do vehicular manslaughter on my cousins.
4095360	4097080	Listen to me, Rob.
4097080	4098080	You're so mean.
4098080	4099080	Whatever.
4099080	4101040	Get over it, baby.
4101040	4103000	Imagine not being a baby.
4103000	4104000	Alright.
4104000	4107440	Are there more emails?
4107440	4109440	No, there's just this one.
4109440	4111280	Oh my god!
4111280	4114000	How many freaking emails did we get this week?
4114000	4115960	You do know we like to finish the show in like three hours, right?
4115960	4117960	I'm reading the rest of this.
4117960	4118960	Hush.
4118960	4119960	Alright.
4119960	4120960	Rob.
4120960	4121960	No.
4121960	4126920	To bring this back to video game talk, before I left for my trip, it's tradition I buy a
4126920	4132120	new game, so I've been holding out and getting Phoenix Wright 2 as I've never played the
4132120	4133120	first one.
4133120	4134240	I would like to play them in order.
4134240	4138100	I picked it up but didn't open it while I was out there and had a chance to go around
4138100	4140560	the area and found an EB.
4140560	4146260	We went in and I found the first Phoenix Wright for less than $50.
4146260	4149080	It was the lowest bidding off of eBay before I left.
4149080	4152560	It was actually $34 Canadian with tax.
4152560	4156360	Alberta only has like 6% tax compared to 15%.
4156360	4158800	So I picked that up and have almost beaten it.
4158800	4161840	This game is at least a must rent if you have a DS.
4161840	4165760	From there we went to the West Edmonton Mall and I found ourselves in an arcade where for
4165760	4168040	the first time I saw Guitar Freaks in Dramania.
4168040	4173160	I can now agree that Guitar Hero wasn't original but did a lot of things right.
4173160	4176080	Now listening to the last week's show, I have some questions for you.
4176080	4185260	The Smash Bros. site has been updating their site daily and I only have to say I can't
4185260	4190160	wait for this game to come out but do you think they will have online in it?
4190160	4195000	In my opinion it would be Sonic and Tails.
4195000	4202380	I'm so sorry Solar Wing, you're great but your emails use punctuation please.
4202380	4207520	And non-sentences are very very hard to follow.
4207520	4211680	Now I know why when I read the email you said I'm like Jamie when I was yelling about their
4211680	4214560	grammar and stuff.
4214560	4218680	As much as I'd like to see online, I think there's going to be as much online as there
4218680	4225760	is punctuation in this email.
4225760	4230240	I wish they would go online with it and I wish maybe that would be like a big surprise
4230240	4235480	Nintendo is going to pull out of their butt come the end of the year.
4235480	4238720	Maybe it will be a big E for All announcement since nobody else is going to announce anything
4238720	4239720	in E for All.
4239720	4240720	I don't know.
4240720	4243280	But I'm not holding my breath.
4243280	4245560	Super paraphrasing powers activate!
4245560	4248120	Okay, yes.
4248120	4250000	This one's for you and me, Rob.
4250000	4254020	Since we both played Ragnarok online, which I think is funny to being referred to, aka
4254020	4261200	Fisher Price, my first MMORPG, he and his sister are crippling RO addiction and they're
4261200	4266760	on the way to the 13 steps.
4266760	4269880	What is a good MMO to play?
4269880	4273640	She suggested World of Warcraft, but she says it looks complicated.
4273640	4276120	World of Warcraft is not that complicated.
4276120	4277120	Try Rose Online.
4277120	4281560	I don't know that one.
4281560	4284640	It's another Gravity game, sort of Ragnarok-y.
4284640	4287200	Actually, Ragnarok 2 is out in beta.
4287200	4290280	Kingdom of Loathing.
4290280	4291280	Puzzle Pirates.
4291280	4294880	Yeah, Puzzle Pirates might be fun for that if you like puzzles and stuff and it's pretty
4294880	4295880	easy to get into.
4295880	4298680	I mean, I didn't care for it, but you might like it.
4298680	4299680	It's kind of fun.
4299680	4302000	Like, if you like the PopCappy-type games, you'd probably like Puzzle Pirates.
4302000	4303000	Tetranet!
4303000	4304000	No.
4304000	4309600	Kingdom of Loathing would be great, though, because of all the monsters that have misspellings.
4309600	4314000	I forget, it was like the cemetery or something where everything was misspelled, all the monster
4314000	4315000	names.
4315000	4316000	That's fantastic.
4316000	4317000	So.
4317000	4318000	Funny.
4318000	4319000	Okay, that's it.
4319000	4321920	Darknight in chat, by the way, suggests a Phantasy Star universe or Guild Wars.
4321920	4324120	PSU is crap.
4324120	4327280	Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.
4327280	4332000	I suggest if you're going to play one of the Phantasy Star MMOs, go for Blue Burst because
4332000	4336120	it's a lot better and you can actually use a force in that game without having to retardedly
4336120	4337120	crap it.
4337120	4338120	Crap it!
4338120	4340640	Darknight says, stop hatin'.
4340640	4341800	I can hate all I want to.
4341800	4342800	It's a free country.
4342800	4344800	I want to play a better game.
4344800	4345800	That was great.
4345800	4348760	Shane says to play a better game.
4348760	4354160	So he wants our Wii codes, but we'll have to put them back up.
4354160	4356280	Anyway, I can't read any more of this email.
4356280	4358560	I'm sorry, Solar Wing.
4358560	4359560	Was that the last email?
4359560	4361080	Yeah, that was the last email.
4361080	4362080	Hooray!
4362080	4364080	We can move on with the show.
4364080	4366520	Hooray!
4366520	4367520	Let's see here.
4367520	4369040	I mean, you should email us sometime.
4369040	4370040	Mailbag at orangeontario.com.
4370040	4372840	We'd love to hear from you, just not all in the same week.
4372840	4373840	I'll email us.
4373840	4374840	It will be.
4374840	4375840	Jamie is awesome.
4375840	4382400	Well, anyways, now I have news on an upcoming retro compilation now.
4382400	4386440	I know you might be going, ugh, retro compilation, who wants that?
4386440	4391800	Well, this is the Atari Classics Evolve, and I think this is kind of how you do a retro
4391800	4393640	compilation.
4393640	4400520	Not only do you get eleven classic Atari arcade titles, like Asteroid Battlezone and stuff,
4400520	4408560	in both the original and evolved versions, but you get sixty Atari 2600 classics.
4408560	4412120	That's right, seventy games in one.
4412120	4413120	Hell yeah.
4413120	4414120	That's a lot of games.
4414120	4415240	That is a lot of games.
4415240	4419080	I want seventy versions of Metal Slug.
4419080	4420960	There probably will be someday.
4420960	4422840	Give it time.
4422840	4423840	One day.
4423840	4424840	One day.
4424840	4433240	But some of the eleven evolved classics in it, they are seeing, let's see here, Yars
4433240	4438400	Revenge, Night Driver, Canyon Bomber, Crystal Castles.
4438400	4439800	Crystal Castles is great.
4439800	4441040	Crystal Castles is pretty rad.
4441040	4446000	But I don't know, I feel like a lot of these classics, I've already played Death elsewhere.
4446000	4447000	I don't know.
4447000	4448280	I don't know if I can get that excited about it.
4448280	4450440	Oh, I'm sorry, those weren't the evolved titles.
4450440	4452280	Those are just some random titles they were saying.
4452280	4453920	Can I play over the internet or with other people?
4453920	4461120	You can play with other people Wi-Fi, and they also have an online leaderboard.
4461120	4462120	What else?
4462120	4466400	Actually, it says, oh yeah, you can just compare scores.
4466400	4469920	I was going to say, hopefully it has it over the internet.
4469920	4475560	The evolved titles, I guess, Asteroids, Asteroids, Deluxe, Battlezone, Centipede, Lunar Lander,
4475560	4481040	Millipede, Missile Command, Super Breakout, Tempest, Warlords, and Pong.
4481040	4483480	Wow, super evolved Pong.
4483480	4484480	I can't wait for that.
4484480	4485480	Hey, they had Tempest in there.
4485480	4486480	Yeah, Tempest is cool.
4486480	4492400	I saw you playing Space Giraffe earlier, Miklotov, while we were done, so what did you think?
4492400	4496560	I couldn't tell if it was really a game or an interactive screensaver, because I didn't
4496560	4498360	know what I was doing most of the time.
4498360	4502040	It's just really, really colorful, and it wasn't fun.
4502040	4505160	It's hard to see a damn thing in it, isn't it?
4505160	4509080	There's like the one enemy that's really easy to see, and then everything else is just the
4509080	4512200	background that apparently hurts you sometimes.
4512200	4519360	All right, well, how about, speaking of lists, there's some new tracks that are coming out
4519360	4523680	for the upcoming music games Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3.
4523680	4530680	Guitar Hero 3 has gotten some international tracks and some tracks from all around.
4530680	4538840	Ten new songs were announced this week, including Ruby by the Kaiser Chiefs, Radio Song by Super
4538840	4542520	Bus, and Minus Celsius by the Backyard Babies.
4542520	4546320	I've not heard of a lot of these bands, but apparently it's some more international flavor,
4546320	4547320	so hooray for diversity.
4547320	4549440	Wait, wait, wait, what was the first one that you mentioned?
4549440	4550440	Kaiser Chiefs.
4550440	4551640	That's the only one I've heard of from the list.
4551640	4552640	No, that you mentioned.
4552640	4554640	Sorry, it must have been the second one then.
4554640	4556640	Oh, hell.
4556640	4557880	Yeah.
4557880	4558880	I closed the list.
4558880	4559880	Don't worry about it.
4559880	4560880	Super Bus.
4560880	4561880	That was it.
4561880	4562880	That's pretty cool.
4562880	4563880	All right.
4563880	4569680	Now coming to Rock Band, some songs you might know a little more in-depth stateside, such
4569680	4575320	as the Rolling Stones with Gimme Shelter, The Clash, Should I Stay or Should I Go, Smashing
4575320	4580440	Pumpkins with Cherub Rock, Nine Inch Nails, The Hand That Feeds, Beastie Boys, Sabotage,
4580440	4583600	and one of my favorites, Radiohead with Creep.
4583600	4589700	Because I'm a creep, I'm a winner.
4589700	4593080	I'm not playing Rock Band with you on that song, if you're going to take the mic and
4593080	4594080	do that.
4594080	4597320	You know what I think would be better than Creep for Radiohead songs?
4597320	4598320	My Iron Lung.
4598320	4599320	What?
4599320	4600320	How about Fake Plastic Trees?
4600320	4601320	No.
4601320	4602320	That's not a Rock Band song.
4602320	4603320	It's not a Rock Band song.
4603320	4604320	I just like that song.
4604320	4605320	Radiohead.
4605320	4606320	It's emo.
4606320	4607320	It's emo at its finest.
4607320	4610120	But My Iron Lung is like a perfect combination.
4610120	4612760	Anyway.
4612760	4614560	I like Cherub Rock in the game.
4614560	4615560	I like Smashing Pumpkins.
4615560	4618720	Well, Smashing Pumpkins is cool, I guess.
4618720	4623080	So speaking of Guitar Hero 3, though, moving on to other games that are trying to be like
4623080	4630100	other games, Guitar Hero 3 is going to have a demo inside the Xbox 360 version of Tony
4630100	4632720	Hawk's Proving Ground.
4632720	4638800	It actually will be released in the UK on October 9th, and the demo will be included
4638800	4642300	with it before it makes it onto Xbox Live.
4642300	4649160	So they're saying that what's going to be listed is Laid Down by Priestess, Even Flow
4649160	4654760	by Pearl Jam, The Metal by Tenacious D. I love Tenacious D. Hit Me With Your Best Shot,
4654760	4661360	As Made Famous by Pat Vanitar, and a cover of Rocky Like a Hurricane.
4661360	4664560	What are the scorpions doing anyway?
4664560	4667360	Why can't they just use the tracks?
4667360	4668360	Stinging people?
4668360	4669360	No.
4669360	4670360	God.
4670360	4677560	Well, that's great news, but here's something even funnier.
4677560	4686040	In the ongoing battle between Sony and, I guess, PSP hackers over firmware control,
4686040	4687320	who will dominate?
4687320	4693580	I think the hackers may have actually launched the final blow.
4693580	4699320	There is a brand new application being released out there called Pandora's Battery.
4699320	4705360	What this is, actually, say for example you have a PSP that got fucked up and broke, and
4705360	4707080	you send it back to Sony.
4707080	4711840	The way they reset them is they have a Sony battery that triggers the PSP to go into a
4711840	4717240	service mode, and then they can reset the whole thing, and away you go.
4717240	4719560	Well, this does something very similar.
4719560	4724640	It allows you to hack the battery's firmware to actually create your own debug battery,
4724640	4733280	so with that and a combination with a PSP memory stick, you can downgrade, you can unbrick
4733280	4739680	any PSP, no matter the firmware, so that's pretty awesome.
4739680	4741760	It will downgrade anything to 1.5.
4741760	4747760	If you have a bricked PSP from failed whatever, it will fix it.
4747760	4749920	Now how much is this puppy going to cost?
4749920	4750920	Nothing.
4750920	4751920	It's free to download.
4751920	4752920	Yeah.
4752920	4756160	I mean, you download the program, you run it on your PC.
4756160	4761240	All you need is a PSP battery to create this debug battery.
4761240	4767220	You can turn the battery back to its normal mode afterwards, if you'd like.
4767220	4771320	The only thing you will need, though, is to create this device.
4771320	4776160	You will need one of the custom firmwares, but if you have a friend that has that, you
4776160	4779040	create this, and then you're good to go on any PSP.
4779040	4780040	Hooray!
4780040	4782040	Kid Icarus on my PSP again!
4782040	4783040	Yay!
4783040	4784040	Who knows?
4784040	4791840	This will be interesting when the new PSPs come out, the Slims, but then again, I think
4791840	4795760	if you downgrade it, you're going to lose all that video out capability.
4795760	4797760	Time for a new firmware.
4797760	4798760	Interesting.
4798760	4802280	It's always interesting to see kind of the back and forth between the hacking community
4802280	4807360	and then the official stuff, and I can understand Sony wanting to stop the piracy and people
4807360	4813040	posting the games on the internet and all that stuff, but show a little homebrew love.
4813040	4814040	Little bit.
4814040	4815040	Little bit.
4815040	4819080	All right, anyhow, moving on to a title that was creating a lot of news in recent weeks
4819080	4821020	on the program, Manhunt 2.
4821020	4825000	A lot of folks thought this game was dead in the water, it's going away, no more are
4825000	4830640	we going to see this because you just can't fix the game down from an AO rating.
4830640	4831640	Well guess what?
4831640	4836940	It has been modified down to an M-rated version, and Manhunt 2 will be out on the PlayStation
4836940	4842520	2, PSP, and Wii on Halloween, October 31st, 2007.
4842520	4844840	What a hilarious day to release this game.
4844840	4845840	Awesome.
4845840	4849400	A quote from Rockstar founder and president Sam Houser, quote, Manhunt 2 is important
4849400	4853600	to us and we're glad it can finally be appreciated as a gaming experience.
4853600	4858320	Manhunt 2 is a powerful piece of interactive storytelling that is a unique video game experience.
4858320	4860840	We think horror fans will love it.
4860840	4863960	Nowhere though has it been said what exactly they had to change.
4863960	4869600	I mean, obviously they've scaled down some of the violence, perhaps, but as to specifics,
4869600	4872560	your guess is as good as mine.
4872560	4874120	They added bunnies.
4874120	4878920	I hope all they did was submit a different video to the ESRB, because-
4878920	4882100	Well they have to play the game, don't they now?
4882100	4887760	When I was still at Konami, we still just did videos, so who knows, I hope they don't
4887760	4890840	have to cut anything because I want that game.
4890840	4894920	What they did is they changed all the blood to sweat- Or all the blood to fire, remember,
4894920	4899020	because it's okay to burn people alive, it's just not okay to have them bleed.
4899020	4902720	But there will be a secret blood code in the game that will restore all the blood from
4902720	4903720	the original demo.
4903720	4906440	As will unlock a sex mini-game as well.
4906440	4911220	Yes, and you can use your game genie to change the colors of the sweat as well to make the
4911220	4915240	experience that much more realistic.
4915240	4916240	But sweat is great.
4916240	4917240	It is.
4917240	4921040	You know what I always thought was funny is that, because I've got the Samurai Shodown
4921040	4926280	2 out of the Japanese cart for my Neo Geo, if you switch it from Japanese to English
4926280	4928520	mode the blood changes color.
4928520	4930480	I'm not even joking.
4930480	4934160	You have the big spray of sweat, and then you change it as the big spray of blood.
4934160	4938240	If I developed video games, I would actually put a code that changes the blood into sweat
4938240	4943040	just to be funny, like to make reference to the old school Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat.
4943040	4944440	That was fantastic.
4944440	4947840	Okay, anyway, how about something regarding Eidos?
4947840	4948840	Okay.
4948840	4952240	And something that I love, which is Highlander.
4952240	4958280	Because however many shows are based off of cutting people's heads off.
4958280	4959280	Not too many.
4959280	4961160	Not a lot that I can think of.
4961160	4963160	Buffy, kind of.
4963160	4966840	That's staking or cutting their head off.
4966840	4967840	One and a half.
4967840	4968840	One and a half.
4968840	4969840	I agree with that.
4969840	4970840	I love Buffy.
4970840	4973360	Angel, not so much because he was a whiny bitch.
4973360	4976040	Okay, moving forward.
4976040	4980440	There is going to be a Highlander game that is going to be...
4980440	4981440	Call him.
4981440	4982440	What?
4982440	4983440	Sorry, never mind.
4983440	4984440	What?
4984440	4987480	I was trying to add sound effects, but forget it.
4987480	4989480	Stop farting in the microphone.
4989480	4990480	Anyway.
4990480	4993400	There can be only one.
4993400	4994400	Okay.
4994400	4999120	It will be on PS3, 360, and PC.
4999120	5007160	It's a third person action game that will cross 2000 years from feudal Japan, from Scotland
5007160	5014720	in the old days, Pompeii, New York in the future, and you go all over the place cutting
5014720	5015720	off people's heads.
5015720	5019640	Sadly, I think this is going to be timed with a new movie that's coming out.
5019640	5023840	Yeah, they're making another Highlander movie.
5023840	5026360	I hope that with his face you can end it, because that man is blind.
5026360	5027360	He almost killed everybody.
5027360	5029360	Do you understand?
5029360	5031840	Stop it, Rob.
5031840	5032840	You can use...
5032840	5034400	I am Colonel McCloud of the Clan McCloud.
5034400	5040840	I was born in 1518 in the village of Glenfinnan on the shores of Loch Siel, and I am immortal.
5040840	5047880	Okay, my favorite line in the first one is when he keeps calling Ramirez an overblown
5047880	5048880	haggis.
5048880	5055720	I am Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez, chief metallurgist to King Charles V of Spain, and
5055720	5057880	I'm at your service.
5057880	5059560	Why does he sound Scottish if he's Spanish?
5059560	5060560	I love Spanish.
5060560	5061560	It also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head.
5061560	5062560	The head, which is this time, has no name.
5062560	5063560	I know his name.
5063560	5081040	His name is Mr. Heady.
5081040	5089160	You play Owen McCloud, and you fight 77 other people, and you have 18 missions so far.
5089160	5094940	You get to play with zip wires, daggers, free falls, swan dives.
5094940	5100160	It will be pretty gory, pretty mature.
5100160	5108360	And also, you have a choice of three weapons, like a tana, claymore, or a, I guess, double?
5108360	5109360	On the Wii?
5109360	5110360	On the Wii?
5110360	5111360	I can actually slice people's...
5111360	5114360	It's like, well, I said from the beginning, PS3 360 or PC?
5114360	5115360	Doh.
5115360	5118240	But you also get powers.
5118240	5120200	I don't remember any of them having actual powers.
5120200	5121200	Alright.
5121200	5123480	Other than, oh my god, I sense danger.
5123480	5124560	It's another immortal.
5124560	5125860	Let's kill him.
5125860	5126860	Alright.
5126860	5129880	Well, let's go ahead and take a quick break.
5129880	5131720	This segment's ran on long enough, that's for sure.
5131720	5134280	We're gonna take a quick break, and when we come back from this break, more of Orange

5138840	5144760	little bit about Super Mario Galaxy, the penny arcade game for Xbox Live Arcade, and a list
5144760	5145960	list for tonight.
5145960	5150960	Oh boy, we'll be right back with more after this of Orange Launch Radio.
