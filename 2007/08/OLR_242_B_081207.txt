Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
And welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 242, this part B, on August 12th, 2007.
Of course, we do tape live on Sunday nights at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
And we have a chat room full of folks who are chatting about what we were talking about during the bonus segment, which is for the live-only folks.
We were talking about possibly creating a fighting game that would be like Capcom versus SNK, except it would be Orange Lounge Radio versus All Games Interactive.
And I think the results there would be hilarious, so...
We'll have to talk more about that, maybe make a thread in the forums and see if all games would want to get some of their talented artists and game designers in on it too.
Just do it in one of those create-your-own-fighting-game programs.
I think it would be hilarious.
A lot of people would enjoy that.
Meanwhile, let's get back into the gaming news and talk about the real console gaming news out there.
I believe Loki's going to start us off this segment.
Yes, apparently there's a rumor going around that Sony is going to acquire Rockstar Games.
Yes.
I guess this would be good for Sony since they need more first party games and definitely having the Grand Theft Auto franchise to themselves would be pretty good.
Although, I don't know.
Apparently various sources of the press and I guess development team are saying that Sony is looking to take Rockstar under their wings and I know that they have LA Knorr coming out for the Playstation 3 exclusively in the spring so
I don't know.
They're saying also, I guess, there's going to be another exclusive game afterwards, but I can't help but think there may be some exclusive games for Sony, but I doubt that they're actually going to be bought up by Sony, because they're making money hand over fist, so...
They'd be so stupid to cut out the Xbox 360.
Doesn't it seem like this story is somewhat like jumping to conclusions?
Like that's the feeling I got when I read it is that, oh, well, Rockstar has been working a lot with Sony, and now they're doing this exclusive thing for Sony, so therefore Sony's going to be buying Rockstar.
I don't think – I mean, think about it.
I mean, why would they say – I mean, I guess if they're part of Sony, it doesn't matter that they're not selling as many units, but –
They're not exactly suffering or struggling financially, I think.
I mean, granted, Grand Theft Auto 4 being delayed is not helpful or all the lawsuits, but shit, when that game comes out, they're not going to be struggling financially.
Some healthy skepticism courtesy of the chat room as well.
Frisbee says, not going to happen without a big fight.
Ross Steel UT says, Microsoft just paid them $50 million.
It's not going to happen.
Yeah, perfect example.
There you go.
PSP Tube
DarkSakura.com
Look at more information.
But basically, you have to make a developer ID and put it in this file, and then it's kind of a bunch of crap you have to do.
But they also just released another new version of it that's supposed to have a favorites folder and stuff like that that you can download videos and stuff from there.
And unlike, sure, you could do this probably through the web browser as well, but...
This is actually streaming videos straight off YouTube.
This isn't just viewing them off of a web page or anything.
So I guess it's a little bit better.
SSJ100Matt has a good thought here.
How long until PSP OrnoTube or PSP YouPorn or PSP XTube?
It's just a matter of time, right?
I hope.
Because that's what people really want to do on their PSP.
And they get the XXXbox.
Boo!
Boo!
I wanted a cookie, Rob.
The brand new bad joke mistress of Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura.
No, no, no.
I was emulating Junami.
I did buy that.
I bought an 160 gig external hard drive for videos on either the 360 or PS3.
Alright, I will go get Jamie a cookie while she reads the next story.
There's one cookie left.
Well, for anybody who actually gives a crap about this game, and also since it's a
A UK release that I'm referring to.
It was slipped during a press conference that, well, Activision UK is only confirming winter.
However, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare has been given the date of November 9th for Europe on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360.
So you can have fun shooting down people if you want to.
Enjoy.
And I think that's about the same time as the one in the US is coming out, so it's not a huge surprise that they're releasing around that same time.
Obviously, extremely awesome game.
I mean, the video that they've been showing so far, very early, but very fucking awesome.
That's your kind of game.
I think so.
The other thing that's kind of interesting, there's a whole PlayStation Starter Pack that was going on in the UK recently,
apparently it was one where they were actually offering the 60 gig system with resistance and motor storm and two controllers for a set amount now the problem is that there's conflicting sources saying that the starter pack might actually be in jeopardy that they might be done with it in August 31st so much like you know the limited price point drop for the 60 gig system and that is
Manhunt 2 Manhunt 2
Rockstar Games is currently appealing the decision.
and there was actually an associate at game specialist law firm Osborne Clark said something about how it may be a while before this decision has the possibility to be overturned.
Last time this happened with Carmageddon, the appeal worked so that's a positive precedent.
Rockstar has taken a while to build its case so they've obviously been taking stock of what the BBFC have said.
They'll have to work together to agree on making the right cuts.
So it is possible that the BBFC could reconsider, but we won't find out for quite a long time.
Also, something to think about is that, quote, if the BBC feels that the violence running throughout the game is too much, it's not like a film where you can just cut out certain scenes, as of course a lot of people said when the story first hit the internet, when the game was first banned.
No, I'm really disappointed.
I can understand why they would want to censor it and stuff so that it can be released and
I wish all this talk would just...
I just wish all this talk would go away and I wish they could just release the damn thing with an adults-only rating and everybody didn't have a collective thumb up their butt about how having adults-only games on their platforms are going to corrupt children across America.
Sony needs to go and say, hey, we'll accept adult-only games.
Go ahead and bring it out on the PlayStation 2 and PS3 exclusively.
There you go.
A little bit of an edge for them.
All right, well, we shall see what happens.
I'm sure this won't be the last time you hear about Manhunt 2, like it or not.
Well, this is actually pretty cool.
A business called Omega Sector opened in Birmingham, of course, in Europe.
Not the Birmingham in Alabama.
No, but I've been there.
I've been there lots of times.
It's not fun.
Sorry, people in Alabama.
But this is a place that has 400 custom-built PCs.
It's 22,000 square feet, two floors, it has an internet cafe, movies, a room for Xbox 360 gaming, sponsored by Squeenix, THQ, Activision, and they've all got their own little places to play at.
You can play Final Fantasy XI, Call of Duty, Shadow of Chernobyl, Stalker, and...
It's just a big, massive gaming spot.
And so it's open for business.
Someday when I become rich, I will open something like that and call it the Orange Lounge.
But that's pretty cool, though.
Well, there's two mobile Omega sectors that will come and do parties and concerts and things like that.
But this is kind of cool.
You pay five pounds to get in.
And then you can go around.
There's promo stuff everywhere.
You could basically not just go into play.
You've got stuff for actually interacting with people.
So that's kind of cool.
We need one next door.
In the backyard.
Yes, in the backyard.
You know, I do have that shed I'm not really using for anything else.
So let's install one of these in there.
Even though there's no air conditioning in there.
We'd probably melt.
You know, there's some interesting news coming out about a violent game law in California that would have restricted anyone under the age of 18 from buying or renting violent video games.
I didn't even know that was in the works, which is interesting.
Well, I'm sure we talked about it previously on the show.
I know we did.
Well, there's been so many states, you know, I just can't keep track of them.
True.
Uh,
Anyway, so the bill signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger back in 2005, it's been overturned.
So that's interesting because, of course, it was unconstitutional.
Yada, yada, yada.
Pretty much the same thing that every single state so far has found out.
You know, it was a while ago when this happened.
I think this was back when we were doing the To Go show.
We were doing the separate shows when this first went through.
I think that's why you forgot about it.
Because I remember that guy, Leland Yee, they were parading him amongst all the game blogs and some of the shows on TV and how he wrote this bill and everything.
And to his credit, even if we may not agree with his law personally, he was at least willing to chat with the game sites and the blogs and stuff.
Yeah.
Well, the thing and problem is it's in violent video games.
And, of course, what is violent?
That's the problem.
It wasn't like adult-only games or mature-rated games cannot be sold to these people.
That's right.
If they had done something like that, then that would have been a little different.
I don't know.
I think it's stupid that they're having laws for that since they don't have laws for that for movies or music or anything like that.
Yeah.
So what happens now?
Is it gone forever?
Is it going to go away?
No, of course not.
Never hear about it again?
Of course not, because when it was deemed unconstitutional, Governor Schwarzenegger says, well, it will be back.
Pun intended, of course.
And he says he isn't done protecting the bill's targeted youth.
Thank you, Schwarzenegger, for saving our kids with censorship.
Thank you very much.
Especially since, um... Yeah, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Schwarzenegger, like, you know, not only star in, but give some money to the Terminator 3 project, which was an R-rated movie that I'm sure many kids snuck into?
I mean, hello.
Or Terminator 2, or Total Recall, I mean, the chick had three boobs, I mean, what kid is not gonna, you know, try to sneak into a movie like that?
I mean, come on.
Where a chick has three boobs?
Exactly.
Exactly.
Alright, well, anyhow, you know, news of these laws not going away and just the fact that here we go again makes us very angsty.
So, of course, you know what that means.
It's time to make our own violence here on the program with our segment called the FUs of the Week.
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
My FU of the week goes towards people who don't know when to shut up.
People who have to get the last word, who must always be right.
People who don't understand when it's better to let things lie than to prolong a bad situation.
FU to that.
Loki, alright, my F.E.
goes to this chair that I'm sitting in because it's horribly uncomfortable.
It's hard, the back of it's like super stiff, like I feel like my spine is being readjusted.
Not good.
And then also F.E.
to my computer for resetting.
I reinstalled Windows with Service Pack 2 now.
Not only is my internet slower thanks to that, but I did kind of try to fix that.
It's still resetting randomly.
I just think the motherboard's crapping out.
It's kind of old.
Need to build a new computer.
That's it.
My review of the week goes to Comcast for reasons previously mentioned.
I mean, just the fact that they completely were fucking up our order made us wait so long to get the freaking internet here.
And then, you know, just we were sitting around the whole day and offered practically no compensation for it.
So they suck big floppy donkey dick.
So that's it.
Thank you for watching!
Well, Spore didn't show up at E3, but Spore will be showing up at the Leipzig Convention in Germany.
It's going to be actually playable behind closed doors.
Now, of course, I wonder if that means, okay, is it like last year's E3 where it's going to be playable by somebody else?
Or will select lucky few people actually get to play it?
Supposedly, Spore is still on track for a 2008 release, but...
I think most people would agree they will release it when it's damn good and ready and they're going to take their sweet ass time to make sure it's right.
So let's hope so.
Let's hope it's right.
But keep your eye on your favorite game blogs from August 23rd to 26th when the Leipzig Games Convention is going on because that's when you're likely to see some news on this.
You see really what's happening though is the game is done.
Right now they're just working on emptying Scrooge McDuck's vault so they can stick all the money in there that they're going to make on this game.
That's what they're doing.
Are they gonna go swimming in it?
And they will go swimming in it.
What?
They're gonna make tons of money off this thing.
That's what it is.
Stop fucking making playable demos.
I mean, that's all they're working on is goddamn playable demos for these stupid events.
Just finish the fucking game.
They're just trying to tease you.
Then you'll make the money to go in the vault.
They want you teased.
Then you'll be able to swim in it.
I just think it's very random that you brought up Scrooge McDuck's vault.
I think that that's appropriate.
By the way, dear Capcom, Capcom, yeah, where the fuck is DuckTales 3?
Why didn't we ever get that?
Maybe because DuckTales is off the air?
Who cares?
It's all about the DuckTales moon level.
I know for real.
The best music ever.
DuckTales.
What kid that grew up in the 80s doesn't remember the DuckTales video game?
DuckTales 2.
Who cares that it didn't sell at all because it was released towards the end of the NES lifespan.
Like every kid had upgraded to a Super Nintendo at that point.
So where is DuckTales 3?
Couldn't it be done on the DS?
What?
Did Capcom lose the license or something?
It's not on the air anymore!
They're hanging out with Duke Nukem.
Who cares?
Look at Kingdom Hearts.
Scrooge McDuck's in Kingdom Hearts and so is Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
But that's also got a lot of the more modern... Even Tron is in Kingdom Hearts 2, which makes me happy.
But you remember, though, those characters were not only on DuckTales.
They actually existed in other cartoon shorts before DuckTales.
I don't really give a shit who makes the DuckTales game.
I just want one and I want it to not suck.
Make it yourself.
They can maybe do a DuckTales level in Kingdom Hearts 3.
Maybe a Darkwing Duck level.
Supposedly, Kingdom Hearts 3 is not Kingdom Hearts 3.
Kingdom Hearts 3.5.
Kingdom Hearts 2, another game, you know.
Like they do 2-2 or something.
I don't know.
Ugh.
Rosteel UT says Kingdom Hearts has shit from the 50s in it.
Or even earlier than that.
They have the Steamboat Willie level.
Yeah, they have the Timeless River or whatever that level is called.
That level is awesome.
The Steamboat Willie level.
But that's like classic Disney.
It's not like they don't have a tailspin level.
Baloo is not wearing...
That's because Tailspin is rip off of the Jungle Book.
You do get one Gummy Bears reference, which is pretty awesome.
With a gummy ship, right?
That's not really the Gummy Bears, though.
But that's what I like to think in my own mind.
It's a Gummy Bears reference.
The thing has absolutely nothing to do with Gummy Bears.
Shut up!
But we've got our poo level.
And I hate the poo levels because they're not all that fun.
Where's my, you know, level based on Swiss Family Robinson or 2000 Leagues Under the Sea?
Remember the Treehouse is gone.
Where's the Herbie Lovebug level?
Dude, they need to have Bruce Campbell in that one, too, because Bruce Campbell is in a Herbie movie.
Or what was the dog?
Not Old Yeller, but the other one.
Shaggy the Dog or whatever it was?
No.
The Shaggy Dog?
The Shaggy Dog, that's it.
That darn cat blood.
Or what about the Witch Mountain movies?
I love those.
Now we're getting random.
Let's please go to another story.
Speaking of random, actually not really, there are new Wii Virtual Console stuff rated out now.
Thank you, ESRB, you bastards.
Thank you, you bastards.
I love that.
Well, what games are they, oh faithful news reporter?
We have Landstalker, The Treasures of King Noel.
I never played that.
I've never even fucking heard of that game.
Shinobi 3, Return of the Ninja Master.
I'm sorry, Shadow Dancer was better.
Shadow Dancer is the best Shinobi game ever.
And?
And Ghouls and Ghosts.
Okay, well that's alright.
Wow, they're really getting obscure on some of these Genesis and TurboGrafx titles that are coming out.
And yet we still don't have Guardian Lession, speaking of obscure.
I know!
Why don't you have, like, Metal Gear on Virtual Console?
Where are some of the other old Konami classics besides Dyskrabius?
Well, you know, there's a good point that they make here that just because it's rated doesn't mean it's going to come out.
So, who knows?
Like, what the fuck, Landstalker, whatever.
You know, they should let me pick games for the Virtual Console.
Because I'd put Panorama Cotton all up in there.
I would too.
Ross Steel UT makes fun of what Jamie said.
Thank you, you bastards.
Ross Steel UT says, I'm very gracious, you retarded spastic fags.
You know, it's like, if I were to pick games for their virtual console, I would be just like, well, how about we pick the one where you fix the fucking internet thing and make it so it's actually, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The Goonies, not The Goonies 2.
No, we need Goonies 2 as well.
Well, we need that eventually, but we need the first one that came out.
I'm saying, where's all the Konami stuff?
Yes, there was.
Yeah, there was, but only in Japan, I think.
And it had an arcade release that was one of those timed Nintendo crappy games that, you know, like they had the Super Mario Bros.
one where all your enemies are beetle bugs.
All right, let's get past that quintessential games we want on virtual console stuff.
Get back into some news.
All right, well, it's very unfortunate that this super awesome game is only exclusive at Walmart, but Chibi-Robo DS, people thought that it might have been scrapped at first, but guess what?
Walmart's going to have the exclusive rights to this super awesome game.
No, really, it really, really sucks.
It was a horrible game, played at E3.
Well, the GameCube one was kind of shitty, too.
Well, let me put it this way, the DS...
Captures the essence of the GameCube game perfectly.
So yay, Chibi-Robo Park Patrol will launch October 2nd at Walmart.
So you know what?
And Walmart is releasing it in a limited edition baby shit green case.
Who knew?
Oh wait, that's not the case.
That's actually baby shit.
DreamKitty.com is offering these very cute little overlays for your Nintendo DS.
They're Hello Kitty overlays!
That's right.
You could take your pink DS Lite and make it pinker with new Hello Kitty overlays.
And it looks like...
It looks like bling a little bit, like they have gemstones on it, but that's the little pattern.
They have a little kitty thing on the front, and then little kitty designs.
Actually, there's really not any kitties inside.
It's all like flowers and gems and all sorts of other girly shit.
I'm surprised they're not selling this at the Sanrio store.
$16.49 plus shipping if you would like to buy this at DreamKitty.com.
And I know I want it, so we'll see.
I'm seriously considering buying it.
How cool would that be?
And as the article says, go for it.
You'll sure be the envy of every 10-year-old girl on the block.
I know.
There you go, Rob.
Well, hold on.
When people come into the house and they see my Hello Kitty toaster and my Hello Kitty coffee maker, it always gets a comment.
Wow, he's crazy.
Oh, my God, you bought that?
No, mostly it's been, oh, my gosh, my daughter would love that.
All right, anyway.
Let's open up the mailbag and get a little serious here on Orange Lounge Radio.
And open up ye olde mailbag and see what you guys, listeners, have to say.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place you can always send those emails to.
And DarkSakura is going to dive on in and pull out some of her favorite emails.
So here she goes.
The first of three emails that I'm going to read.
Hey, OLR guys, not sure if this question has been covered before, but if it has, sorry about that.
Okay, we forgive you.
Next email.
Sites such as BinMoneyStyle.com and its message board cater to BinMoney players mainly in the U.S.
with an English language.
GameFacts.com is another major site with a large message board that deals with all sorts of video games.
It is another site with a user base dominantly from the U.S.
that speaks English.
Using those two sites as an example and excluding 2chan from the answer.
What is one Bimani site from Japan and one major video game and general site from Japan that caters to players from the Japanese region with a fully functional message board and a user base from the same region?
I ask this because we don't hear much from these sites and they don't get much recognition for being a major thriving site outside of Japan.
Thanks, Snaps.
Well, first of all, I don't
I think that I'm the only person in this room that really reads much Japanese and that's maybe 30 kanji if I'm lucky.
So we typically don't go to those sites given that we can't reliably read them.
and that nifty Global Gate doesn't always translate quite right.
Yeah, unfortunately, I don't have a lot to give you there for the same reason.
Like, I don't speak Japanese, so going to those sites doesn't do me a lot of good.
But I can give you this.
It's Aaron in Japan.
There is a site.
Well, actually, outside of that, I can give you one site that's all in Japanese as far as the what is a good Bimani site with boards to look at.
And that would be a website called Mia's Another Leaf.
and that site is mieya.cool.ne.jp and I first discovered this site because they actually have us linked on it and so it came up in the referrer's log and so I checked out the site and they run a fully functional news blog and I'm pretty extensive on the Bomani coverage there and of course they have some DDR characters Alice and Emmy in their logo so you know they've been around a long time the site brags that they've been up since 2001 March 6th of 2001 they've been running so there you go
That's a site you can definitely check out.
Again, that's Mia's Another Leaf.
As far as the more general gaming site, I don't know.
Unfortunately, I couldn't tell you.
Next time you send us an email, tell us the site you want us to plug, and we'll check it out.
General gaming site, I would say probably Famitsu.com.
Yeah, there is Famitsu.
I'm sure they have forums that go along with it.
Alright, next email then.
Next email is...
There's a sigh.
Wow.
My cousin is a perfect example.
Complete lack of discipline for that kid.
Also, I was at the arcade today for some good old-fashioned DDR Max 2.
With my luck, there was a party with a bunch of munchkins running around.
While I played, this little girl kept asking me for money.
Now come on!
I was told never to ask strangers for money when I was a kid, and I never did.
But yeah, her mother wasn't even around either.
Then another kid came up.
They started jumping on the arrows behind me while I was selecting a song.
I went to move back onto the mat and began to play the song and he almost runs into me.
Thank God his mother finally showed up or that kid would have lost a foot had I stepped on it.
Ever had this experience at your local arcade with children?
Yeah, it sucks.
Whatever you do, Jamie, just don't reproduce.
You and your husband will live happy lives.
Sincerely, Osfer.
P.S.
I'm not sure if I spelled your name correctly.
Feel free to connect me.
And Rob spaz your anger.
You spelled my name correctly, by the way.
Thank you.
Well, Ossifer, we'd all like to thank you for the email here at Orange Lounge Radio.
And so would all the screaming children.
I don't know.
I mean, you know, kids are kids.
I think kids, when being parented actively, aren't so bad.
But unfortunately, at a lot of these types of places, like the Arcade and Chuck E. Cheese, these are places where the parents go to get a break.
And they just let their kids run around like crazy.
You did it too when you were a kid.
No, I didn't.
Really?
Really?
I never ran around crazy.
Never ever?
In just my backyard.
Not in public.
I had an all-girl bicycle gang.
Wait, you were a member of a bike gang?
No, it was four of us and we would ride the streets like we were on patrol.
Only I had the best bike of everybody so nobody could keep up with me.
I'm fascinated by the fact that you were in a bike gang when you were a little girl.
That's amazing.
But I wasn't a problem child like that.
Keep in mind, if you grow up in the South, your parents don't give a shit about all this PC bullshit.
They're just going to discipline you.
All that stuff that Bill Ingvall said about going out to the tree and picking your own switch, I did that.
That is cruel and unusual punishment.
Wowzers.
Yeah, I had a birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese.
We all ran around like crazy while our parents sat around and gossiped.
Well, that's how it worked.
I think there's a difference between actually going to an arcade and going to a place where you're expected to be overrun by a bajillion children.
At least with an arcade, you expect to have people monitoring their children.
Well, look at what's happening in arcades.
They're all turning into birthday palaces.
Well, at my arcade, when I worked at one, we would not let any child under a particular age
This is from Misty.
Aw.
Hi, Misty.
Fuck closing on Sundays.
I can't be the only one able to close this night.
No.
I can't be the only one able to close this night of the week.
I miss you guys.
Heart, Misty.
Aw.
That was a short but sweet email.
Aw.
I miss you, too.
Is that it?
That's it.
We need more emails.
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you would like to send us some emails.
Give us some more stuff to read next week.
Well, before I forget, I did want to say that there's no Pump Up the Volume this week, either.
because last week there was a funeral.
This week I have a class, so no pump.
Sorry.
All right.
We will have some weeknight shows slowly returning probably after the summer.
I know Travis is finally back on Saturdays, and I want to say that DMN said he's doing his thing on Thursdays and whatever.
So there's lots of stuff coming up as far as the weeknight shows go, and then Wednesday night should be back pretty soon as well after all this summer craziness has ended.
So let's get back into some game news.
Loki.
Summer craziness.
Anyways.
I was going to say, there's some interesting things.
Not a huge surprise with the day and age that we're living in, but Airport Security is beginning to inspect game consoles.
Don't worry, they're not going to break them open to make sure that it's a game console, but they will x-ray them for you.
and they probably will, um, I don't think they're going to forbid you from bringing them on the plane, but just so you know, it will be x-rayed.
I mean, is anyone surprised?
Well, I bring DSs on the plane and they're, you just have to put them on the x-ray belt like anything else, so.
Exactly, so, I don't know.
Doesn't seem like anything new to me, but I guess maybe the big fat consoles they're doing now, like if you put them in your luggage.
Maybe they're like my wife and go, why are you bringing that around?
It's on a portable console?
What the fuck?
Because you're a hardcore nerd?
I don't know.
Yes.
Well, one thing you could bring around with you if you own an iPhone is NES games.
New NES Emulator for the iPhone
There's no sound.
The controls are not that great for right now.
But, hey, it's a start, and it shows that it can be done.
Now, the first thing you've got to do is, of course, you have to kind of hack your iPhone because of the way you get some of the other stuff on there.
But it's possible.
It's very possible.
Anything is possible.
Of course, I don't have an iPhone, so I couldn't tell you for sure.
I got to see Melody's iPhone.
Oh, yeah?
How's she liking that?
I heard stories about someone being charged $3,000 for browsing the internet on their iPhone.
Oh my lord.
No, they have some unlimited service thing, but I don't know.
I still don't want one.
I want a phone that I can text with.
That's it.
Yeah, the iPhone's a bit much for me.
I want a phone that doesn't shut off randomly.
I understand why people are all getting into it, but it's just not for me.
Just not for me.
You know what?
I have a laptop.
I'm happy with it.
Anyway, there is a little bit of information coming out of the South Park camp.
For anyone who is picking up the Season 10 DVD bundle, you get a 14-day trial of World of Warcraft.
Which is kind of funny because Season 10 had the Warcraft episode in it, huh?
Yeah, but also Blizzard helped them with it, which I thought was funny.
Wow.
I finally saw the episode.
It was funny.
I would think that most people who watch South Park have probably already given World of Warcraft a try once in their life, at least.
I just thought that was funny.
I haven't.
You know who I finally got to play World of Warcraft this week?
By the way, I heard you're finally back.
I saw your post in the forums.
Well, yeah, if anyone would actually add my noob character to the guild and give me money.
Tell me when you're going to be on next, and I'll send you money and get you in the guild.
Okay.
And you know who you can play with now who's also a noob?
William, the boyfriend, is on.
He started playing World of Warcraft because he was such a StarCraft fan.
He still plays StarCraft now.
It's like the one game he really does play and is really into.
And we kind of said, well, if you like that game, why aren't you playing World of Warcraft or some of the other Blizzard titles?
So he tried it out and he loved it.
So now he's sucked into it too.
I play World of Warcraft when there's absolutely nothing else to do.
So I play about once a month.
But when I play, I play for a while.
Stay far away while you still can, because once you get sucked in, it's bad.
I won't get sucked in.
Even when I played Final Fantasy XI, I didn't get sucked in.
That's because you hated it.
But I was really good with a controller.
Hey, I could do all that macro crap with a controller.
That's cool.
Hey, you should have been playing on 360 at some point.
You saw me do that, too.
I know, and I remember commenting, like, wow, how do you do all that shit with a controller?
Of course, the game was designed for the PlayStation 2, so it's supposed to be played with a controller, but I would never be able to do it.
I actually had a hard time figuring out the macros on my function key, so I was just like, screw it, I'll use my controller.
And then I got so pissed off I couldn't play World of Warcraft with a controller.
I was like, damn it!
Alright.
Anyway.
Yes, this only could come from Second Life, but apparently there is a virtual sex program made by a company called Eros LLC, and it makes realistic genitalia and creates sexual moves for Second Life citizens.
And apparently this one guy who created it found out that his works have been
I don't know, it's interesting, the whole sex in Second Life Somebody should sue everybody involved for bringing sex to Second Life, I mean really
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Well, on to a little bit more serious note and something not often talked about would be the good side of gaming.
You know, we hear about all these laws and all these, you know, sex-crazed pervs ruining games.
Well, there's some good news about the good of gaming that's going on.
And it's actually thanks to Wii Sports, the Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute at Minneapolis' Abbott Northwestern Hospital.
actually aids patients who suffered from strokes by letting them play Wii Sports.
That's right.
It's kind of a little bit of their rehab program.
Kind of interesting.
Hand-eye coordination.
There's actually an article that was ran in a local paper called the Star Tribune that talks about the rehab program and even has a picture of a guy there playing Wii Sports.
So kind of cool there.
and let's see, a quote here from one of the patients, quote, I'm not a video game player.
This is the only one I've ever played.
Because of the interaction of the game, I get the physical sensation of playing tennis.
It really works.
It can fool me into thinking that I'm doing what's happening on the screen.
Kind of cool.
So that's cool.
That's why we play games.
So we won't get strokes?
I mean, I play games because they're fun.
Well, simulation games anyway.
Well, I'm glad to see games being used for good and reporting on some of the good stuff about games.
So there you go.
Of course, I don't know.
If these patients are like me, they're going to get bored of Wii Sports in a day or so.
But maybe I'm just jaded.
I think it's more fun if you've got people there with you.
True.
At any rate, though, for those who are into simulations, speaking of that type of thing,
Well, not really.
It's Rock Band.
I mean, hey.
A price point is released of $199.
And if you have an Xbox 360, guess what?
No wireless.
Screwed.
Who cares?
Wireless is kind of overrated.
Wires are long.
Wires can be extended.
Wrap up the wires.
Stop being so lazy.
Is wireless really that big a deal?
I guess.
Some people think so.
Well, especially if you've got the drum hooked up with the wires and the microphone hooked up with the wires, then you're going to have a tripping hazard.
All right, I'll give you that.
The only issue that this game is going to have with that is not everyone's going to have a USB port hub.
And if you're going to try to play four players, you're going to be like, where's the other USB port?
So, you know, that's the only issue that this will have.
But the reason why I think they're not doing wireless is because, you know, to license the wireless, you know, technology patent or whatever from Microsoft or whatever.
Microsoft should just give them a buy on it for this game.
Well, look at Guitar Hero.
I mean, their guitars are $10 more for the wireless, so... I don't know.
Not a big deal, though.
But, um...
Guitar Hero 2 Guitar Hero 3 Guitar Hero 4 Guitar Hero 5
I know it's stupid because I hate Guitar Hero.
You won't play it past a day.
I give it a day that you're going to play it and that's it.
I'm getting... I'm of course going to get the set.
Now you might give it two days.
No, I...
We still play Guitar Hero at my house all the damn time.
You and Dan will have fun with that because Dan likes to play guitar, right?
And he brings his buddies over.
And of course, that's when I go hide because they all get extra manly around each other.
Well, that's the thing.
I won't buy the game because I'll just go over to Loki's house to play it.
Or your house.
Come to my house.
We still need to play Super Metroid, Rob.
Oh, we sure do.
Let's do that.
Soon.
Wednesday.
and DarkSakura.
Rob and Jamie play something on air.
Today we have the Atari 5200.
We're playing Kix.
But because it's the Atari 5200, none of the controllers work.
The end.
We could run it through the camera thing.
I'll have to show you later.
We could put a camera on the TV and do it that way.
Let's do that.
We'll think about it.
I think we can do that.
New show.
Oh, my God.
OMG.
All right.
Anyhow, sorry.
We're going to open up the Skype line very soon, but we've got one more story for you guys before we do that.
And, of course, when the Skype line is open, you can give us a call to talk to us.
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, or you can actually call us on the real phone, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Anyway, so Circuit City isn't too happy with CheapAssGamer because, of course, as you'll remember, there were some – one of their forum posters by the name of Speedy1961 –
had leaked the ads from Circuit City to the website.
And of course that revealed the price drop information for the PlayStation 3 and none were too happy about that.
So they've actually subpoenaed CheapAssGamer to try to find out who the real identity of Speedy1961 is.
But of course CheapAssGamer is going to be fighting this because they want to protect
The rights of their posters.
So it should be interesting.
I don't know if it's an employee of any one of those because I think they also had Best Buy and other types of ads leaked as well.
Boy oh boy.
Yeah, well, I mean, what do you guys think?
Do you think they have the right to be putting out the subpoena out there?
Or do you think maybe if they wanted to protect the information, they shouldn't have kind of leaked it in the first place?
Both, I think.
Well, I don't know if they have.
I mean, granted, it's, you know, stuff that's not supposed to be out there.
So they have the right to protect that.
But at the same time, you know, they should be more careful with, you know, information getting leaked.
Maybe have more of these people signing, you know, nondisclosure agreements and stuff like that.
I don't know.
If they are smart, there should be some sort of policy regarding this if it is an employee that's doing that and they should be able to take proper action based on that policy.
If they don't have a policy in place for that, then well, you're kind of setting yourself up for trouble.
Alright, well you guys can call right now and give us your opinion because the Skype line is open.
Again, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio or our 800 number is 1-877-GAME-OLR Skype line is open and we're taking calls so we'll go ahead and go to the first call.
At least we're going to try to go to the first call here.
I hate this new Skype version.
I hate it so much.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Raven Stolfen, how are you tonight?
Hi, fine, thank you, Raven Stolfen.
What's on your mind?
Two things on my mind.
The Bioshock demo is up on Xbox Live.
Oh, I heard somebody say that in the chat room during the show.
I was saving it for the last minute story, but yeah.
All right, well, that's all right.
Have you looked at it yet?
Have you looked at it yet?
I'm downloading it.
It's like at a crawl because it's like, you know, everyone's like, OMG.
Yeah, probably everybody's trying to get it right now.
All right, well, thank you for the heads up so we can get even more people on there to download it and slow down the network even more.
Brilliant idea.
I'm just teasing.
I'm sorry for ruining Loki's thunder, but I have a drink review for you.
Okay.
The new Game Fuel, the new Game Fuel thing.
I actually got my hands and drank some of it.
I have never even heard of Game Fuel.
It's that Mountain Dew thing for Halo 3.
Oh, God.
All right, how is it?
Do you like Citrus Cherry?
I'm not sure.
I like Cherry 7-Up.
I like Citrus and I like Cherry, so I don't know why I wouldn't.
Then you're probably going to like this.
It's like this.
It's kind of like, imagine Pepsi.
I know that sounds a little wrong because it's Mountain Dew.
Imagine Pepsi and Citrus Cherry kind of had sex with each other and you get this kind of bastardation.
Well, Mountain Dew is a lovely image to have in my mind.
I thought it was like Livewire and Code Red mixed together.
Oh no, oh no.
I thought it was going to be that way too, but it's not.
Oh no.
Does it make you any better at Halo?
Is there anything else you want to share with the callers tonight, RavensDolphin?
One more thing, as usual.
Do you think we're going to get tired?
It seems like right now we have the kiltrocity of Halo 3 things coming out.
We have this drink.
We have Burger King getting in the act.
What else are we going to see?
Are we going to see Halo 3 underwear?
Are we going to see Halo 3 clocks?
What the hell are we going to see?
Halo 3 underwear.
I might check that out.
That might be kind of fun.
You know what?
You're probably just going to see everything.
I don't know about underwear, but probably everything else.
I want Halo 3 underoos.
Halloween costumes.
I don't know about that.
I want Master Chief underoos.
She'll wear them around the house.
Let me end on one thing and say I hate them.
I've seen them in Charlie's Angels where she was dancing in her underoos.
No, I don't... Probably some of the other stuff you mentioned, though, is certainly a possibility.
Clocks, watches, figurines, books, other collectibles, you name it, it'll be there.
Now the chatroom's just going crazy.
Son of Dad says Halo 3 condoms.
TigerClaw says Halo 3 the cereal box.
Oh, Bandit says Halo underwear for those who need extra man cannon support.
There you go.
Uh...
Let me end with this note.
I hate the MacBook Pro.
Thank you.
All right.
You're welcome.
Have a good one, buddy.
Thanks for calling.
You too.
Bye.
Bye.
All right.
Let's go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
And unfortunately, only one call can come through at a time or everything kind of gets screwed up here.
So we're going to another call.
Man, I can't handle this.
This Skype needs to be changed.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Um... Uh... Hello?
Yeah.
Hi, hello.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Nah, it's Legend of Zaku.
Just seeing, you know, since I was trying to get through it and everything.
That's alright.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Nothing, just trying to struggle through disappointments over the weekend.
In particular, Supernova 2, which has been crapping out in Jersey Gardens.
I've heard that there's another location test for DDR Supernova 2.
What's the deal?
It was the same place where they had the second Supernova location.
They had another Supernova location test last year.
Anyways...
What I've been able to gather from all the folks around my area that actually went to the location test on Thursday Seems that they had, you know, there was brand new paranoias discovered You know, a particular paranoia, Hades Just started to shape up to, you know, become a really good 9-footer Uh-huh Um, trying to dig up the information right now, uh
We have crossovers in the form of Bloody Tears, you know, that Castlevania song from Distorted actually now making its appearance in DDR.
I'm trying to see what else.
Okay, I know it's a whole bunch of videos, but I'll post a clip right now of the track from Ramadi Style.
Okay.
Wait, so you actually got to play the test?
You went out to Jersey to play the test?
Hello?
Not really.
Oh, okay.
Because, you know, it was working up until Thursday, and then Friday it was just crapping out ever since.
Saturday it managed to get up, but then it started crashing after just scrolling through songs.
And then when I showed up today, it was still back to Supernova.
Ah, I see.
Bandit says if you just type Supernova 2 into YouTube, you can get a bunch of stuff.
All right, so you're just mad.
Well, I mean, it is a test machine, Zaku.
It's not going to work perfectly, right?
Right.
I assume they had a bad upgrade kit.
for all intents and purposes.
They're probably going to straighten those issues out.
It could be hardware related.
Let me try to keep this constructive.
Zaku, what would be the one thing you would want to see Konami do with Supernova 2?
Well,
I know they probably won't be able to do this.
Memory card slots, which is damn near impossible at this point.
EMUs would be nice.
Just follow through on it.
Make it offline in addition to online versions just so that you get more arcades to adopt it for those that don't have the money or don't have the means of actually getting an internet connection.
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Zaku?
um that's pretty much um that's pretty much it hopefully you know if that thing gets back up try to get some more more info but as far as it goes there are you know there are brand new there are brand new 10 footers showing up especially you know from the videos you know the new
especially in the only course Boss Rush.
So it certainly gives something to keep people busy.
So far it's been positive.
We're just trying to get through the issues that are holding the test room.
I'm happy to go further.
All right.
Well, Zach, we're going to let you go so we can take more calls.
But thank you very much for your call.
We appreciate it.
Have a good one.
Again, if you want to call us, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
GS68.
Hi, GS68.
What's on your mind, buddy?
I finally get to play Maximum Tune 3.
Oh, what'd you think?
Pretty awesome.
Especially like the new ghost battle mode where you basically raise someone's ghost and then after that your ghost gets created.
And then after that it creates a ghost of your driving.
Now, out of curiosity, did you play this on the PlayStation or did you play this on the arcade?
I'm talking about the arcade one.
I think the PlayStation 3 one is based off an older game or something.
But you played the PlayStation 3 one, would you think?
I didn't get it, but again, I can't read Japanese, but I didn't get any sense of what the hell was going on.
I mean, obviously there was racing, but I had no idea what the hell was going on.
I mean, that's the downside about importing Japanese games.
You don't speak the language.
I mean, duh, you're not going to understand the game.
Maximum Toon 3?
That's some pretty good stuff.
Yeah, I've already got a few favorites.
Oh, cool.
Well, then that's a good sign.
I don't know what the hell's wrong with the PlayStation 1.
Maybe you just haven't played far enough into it, or we're just not understanding what the hell we're doing.
I don't know.
But it didn't look like that much fun.
I'm thinking about reselling on eBay.
We'll see.
Well, certainly I will check out the arcade one if they get in an arcade near us, and maybe I'll change my mind.
Or hopefully the PlayStation 1 will come out here eventually.
So we'll see.
Is it really popular?
Are there long lines to play it?
Because the racing games seem to still draw crowds at the arcades.
Well, I played it both at San Diego Golf Club and Mojito's Golf Club, and there's about four or five people waiting on each machine.
Wow.
See, for this day and age, that's still a long wait.
That's a popular game, you know?
All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners, GS68?
No.
All right, well, I will definitely check out Maximum 2 and 3 when I get a chance and let you know, like the arcade version.
I'm not going to base it off a Japanese game I can't understand.
All right.
All right, take care, buddy.
You too.
All right, bye-bye.
We've got enough time for about one more call here.
If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
But we have another call.
Let's go to it.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Is somebody there?
Can you hear me?
Hello?
Hello?
It's a celebrity.
It's Airman.
Hello, this is GameStop where you can pre-order Madden 08 and Halo 3.
How can I help you?
Oh, there you are.
Hi, GameStop, where we can pre-order.
I want to pre-order Halo 6.
Will you take that for me?
No, it's actually the Rob D. How's it going, guys?
Good.
How about you, Rob D.?
Not too shabby.
I was actually curious.
With this Halo Mountain Dew, which I actually did go out and purchase during the break, by the way, because someone described it as a cross between Code Red and regular Mountain Dew, and I love Code Red, but
That's a different story altogether.
Is it good?
I'm curious.
I actually like it.
It's kind of like a Pepsi or Mountain Dew version of, I guess, Sprite Tropical Remix, if you remember that from a few years ago.
Yeah, where the hell are you all getting this at?
Like 7-Eleven?
DarkSakura.com
But I was curious, what licensing agreement between games and some other product would you like to see?
I mean, I think that Nintendo's missing a huge thing with, you know...
Not doing, say, a Mario Pasta thing, like, Hey, it's a Mario Mastacholi!
You know, I thought that they had a Mario Pasta at one time.
I swear to God, I know they had... They had the Nintendo Breakfast Entertainment System.
Bring back the cereal!
They did have Mario Pasta.
I remember they had that, because there was like a little Yoshi-shaped... It was like a Nintendo mac and cheese or something.
And to tell Dark Tetsuya, Hello Kitty 2DX has the Hello Kitty Dreamcast and the Hello Kitty PlayStation 2.
Gosh, what video game tie-ins would you like to see?
I want to see BurgerTime 2 with the Foreman Grill.
How about like Night Trap 90s?
Digital Pictures would still be around if that existed.
You could have like PS2 FMV games.
Night Trap 90s?
What?
Yeah, but Dana Plato's not with us anymore to model them.
I do like the Halo 3 Underoos.
She still can't model them.
From the grave.
Exactly.
That's...
All kinds of weird.
You've been all about the necrophilia tonight.
It's just random.
Let's see.
I'm opening up to the chat room to see what the chat room thinks.
Son of Dad says, Nintendo Wii Sports Bowling Shoes.
GS68 says, Halo Racing Game with Warthogs, Ghosts, and Pontiac Grand Ams.
We need your mom the game.
JVmon says, Mario Spaghetti from Chef Boyardee.
How about Chef Mario?
Come on.
Give me that.
I don't know.
Yeah, I'm drawing a blank.
I'll have to think about that one.
Maybe that's a future list list in our future.
I don't know.
There you go.
I do have one more question for you guys.
Of course, what's up?
One more thing.
Nah, not that going there.
Have you guys heard the news about how 3D Realms supposedly wants to port Duke Nukem 3D over to Xbox Live Arcade?
Stop ruining my last minute stories, dammit!
The callers are ruining your last minute stories tonight.
All right.
No, that's great.
Yes, I did read that story, even if Loki was going to read it later.
This is totally good radio, but I was going to show you.
See, they did have it at one time.
Here's a commercial for Super Mario Brothers Kraft and Macaroni Cheese.
I want that.
How come my mom didn't buy me that when I was a kid?
I actually remember that because they had tips for Super Mario Land 2 on the back.
That's how I found out about the space world.
You know what I fucking hate, though, is the macaroni and cheese that's made out of the powder.
That shit is so nasty.
The bunny ones are good.
If I'm going to make mac and cheese, I have to use that more creamy cheese sauce because the powder is nasty.
Anyway, sorry, that was horrible radio.
And I even forgot what your second question was.
Well, I didn't actually get to it yet.
I was wondering if you had read the story.
I was wondering what other old PC games would you like to see ported to Xbox Live Arcade?
Loom.
I've been clamoring for X-Wing for a long time.
I would love multiplayer X-Wing on Xbox Live Arcade.
But is there anything else?
Okay, we've got Loom.
Put Loom on the list.
We got it.
Check.
Understood.
Yes, ma'am.
Loom was great.
Really?
Loom, Mac and Cheese.
I went and bought a copy of Loom like a year ago on eBay just because I wanted it badly and I can't play it.
There's your branding.
A Loom branded Loom.
Wouldn't that be wonderful?
What's this made out of, Rob?
I don't know.
Glass.
Let's see.
The ferret's in a box where it belongs.
What other old... Well, besides Civilization, just because that's my favorite PC game of all time.
Completely redone.
Descent.
That would be kind of cool.
I'm trying to think of games that would make good multiplayer games.
I remember that from my younger days.
Modem Wars.
Redneck Rampage.
Yeah!
Carmageddon.
How about J.S.
Jackrabbit or Commander Keen?
Anyone else play those?
What?
Commander Keen?
Commander Keen, yeah.
Or J.S.
Jackrabbit?
I think that's Jackrabbit.
Was Jill of the Jungle?
Hell yeah.
Oh, ZZT while we're at it, although I don't think that would really work.
That wouldn't work on Xbox 360, I don't think.
We need Gemstone!
Z-Rabbits for the win.
How's that for your MMO?
It's been years since I've played that game.
We need, like, the old text-based MMOs.
Yes, I want Zork on Xbox Live Arcade.
Multiplayer Zork.
You saw the page that's a 404 error that's Zork.
Yeah, I've seen that.
It's great.
Enter room.
You can't enter room.
Did you ever play the Crimson Room game?
It's a Flash game.
They need those type of games on Xbox Live Arcade.
How about Oregon Trail on Xbox Live Arcade?
There's number munchers.
That'd be pretty rad.
We were talking about Oregon Trail, Rob.
at, um, at Pentagogo, not Pentagogo, that's the old one, um, at California Extreme.
Yeah.
It was me and Julie and Dan and Mel and Melody at the Ben and Jerry's talking about Oregon Trail and all those, and, um, and we were talking about, uh, our favorite old games.
Reliving Diphtheria over and over again.
I was like, dude, where in time is Carmen Sandiego?
There you go, there's another great Xbox Live potential, I don't know.
Where in, no, where in time, specifically.
Now we're just naming random shit.
No, I'm not, I'm serious.
I want that game again.
I was good at it, too.
Well, Rob D., let me ask you.
Oh, thank you.
ShadowCharlie in chat says Heretic.
Yes, we need that game.
No, we just need Hexen.
Rob D., what would you want?
X-Wing and X-Wing Commander Keen.
Well, actually, just X-Wing and JSJ.
That would be the two that I could think of.
Just because those had multiplayer in there already, that would translate perfectly to Xbox Live Arcade.
How about One Must Fall?
Phantasmagoria.
Can you do?
No, seriously, Phantasmagoria.
I'll be pretty right.
Phantasmagoria was huge.
It was like seven CDs, wasn't it?
It gets it.
It's old now.
Well, Rob D., thank you for the conversation about good PC gaming retro goodness, but we've got to let you go and wrap up the show.
No problem.
See you guys later.
All right.
Take care, buddy.
Bye-bye.
All right.
Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.
Thanks so much to those that called in, and sorry to those that didn't get through, but if we took any more calls, then Loki's last-minute stories might get spoiled.
So, Loki, if you have any last-minute stories, please, now's the time.
Anyways, let's see.
Duke Nukem 3D is waiting for the Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade Go Ahead, so I'm going to remove that.
Okay, and Bioshock on the marketplace.
Bye-bye.
Let's see here.
Oh, yeah.
There is apparently a TIFF exploit now in the PlayStation 3 firmware, 1.81, and they've gotten...
and apparently a backup of a PlayStation 1 game to run on it.
Yay.
What game?
I don't know.
And then also a Hello World little demo thing.
Sorry, it was Crash Bandicoot Crash Party.
Therefore, this thing has no usefulness whatsoever because nobody wants to play that fucking game.
Pandemonium.
It was Devil Dice.
Enjoy.
And then I'm going to say this.
XBOX 360 ULTIMATE
with an HDMI port and HD DVD drive.
Because if he's seeing it, oh, it's got to be true.
It must be true.
Why is that even being reported on the site anywhere?
Because this one website likes to report complete rumor stories like that.
Then again, we ran the Sega list, but only because somebody submitted it.
And because I wanted it to be true.
Yeah, we just wanted it to be true.
All right, anyhow...
I have one other last minute story here coming out of Anderson, South Carolina.
Thanks, Tiger Claw, for sending me the link because I think this is all kinds of funny.
This actually happened at a Toys R Us.
There was a 13-year-old PlayStation hater at the store.
Unfortunately, we don't know his name because of those laws that protect children.
But what he did, he used a permanent black marker to write PS3 sucks on 23 plastic security cases used to protect Sony PlayStation games from being stolen.
Of course, the Toys R Us employees caught him.
He was held until police arrived.
His parents were not able to be reached, so he was taken to child services.
When he was asked why he did it by the police, he said, quote, I have an Xbox and I hate PlayStation.
I found the marker lying on the shelf and I guess I was bored.
Sorry.
That's fantastic.
I guess I was bored.
I find it even better they couldn't find the stupid parents.
It was completely unsupervised and poorly raised.
Well, they were off doing crack, of course.
They were off, you know, doing crack.
They should be spayed and neutered.
Remember, spay and neuter your humans.
Did you check the Olive Garden?
Alright, that's it.
Do you have anything, Loki?
No, but I wanted to see some of the stuff for Supernova 2.
I guess I'll have to get the PlayStation 2 game.
Key word is get.
DJ Kipples and Bits says, I guess he didn't have enough games to play on his 360.
Damn the summer game drought.
No, no, you have it mistaken with the PlayStation 3.
Or the Wii.
Christ.
Well, he's playing games on the Wii.
It's just none of them are any good.
By the way, and I don't know how this story did not make tonight's show roll, but I swear to God I saw a story on it somewhere where...
DarkSakura, they have officially announced they're making a Cooking Mama 2.
Squee!
Oh, that's right, because I didn't care.
That's why I wasn't on the show roll, because I was like, oh, Cooking Mama 2, don't care.
I still need to borrow yours, Rob, on the Wii.
I ain't playing it.
Yeah, Cooking Mama 2 in early 2008.
505 Games has entered into agreement with Cooking Mama Limited.
to deliver Cookie Mama 2 for the DS and the Wii across Europe in early 2008.
So I imagine it's just a matter of time.
I want it to be like a story-based game where Cookie Mama's relative accidentally murders somebody and they have to dispose of the body in creative culinary ways.
I think that would be pretty cool.
Mama will fix it.
Cookie Mama.
I don't know.
Cooking Mama Massacre.
Mafia.
Cooking Mama Vice City.
Cooking Mama Mafia Story.
It's Murdering Mama.
Mama Fix Everything.
Cooking Mama Soylent Green.
It's people!
No!
All right.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought because we're about to wrap up the show.
So final thoughts.
Loki, your final thought.
My final thought is game publishers are coming out in a few weeks and that makes me happy.
and my final thought is I still hate macaroni and cheese with the powdered cheese.
I love the powdered cheese!
Cheese should not be in powder form.
That's disgusting.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
That was it?
Freaking cookies.
Cookies are great.
You know, I have more cookie dough.
I should make more cookies.
Let's just eat the cookie dough, Rob.
No, that's disgusting.
No, it's not.
It's great.
You can get sick because of the raw eggs.
You know what?
What?
That's really an old wives' tale.
Because I used to work at a cookie place, and I used to take home the cookie dough.
Just because you didn't get sick does not mean you can't get sick.
I have special not getting sick from cookie dough power.
It's that special butter and sugar mix that protects you from the salmonella.
It lines your stomach.
Leave it to me to be the first person to die from eating cookie dough.
All right.
We're going to wrap it up, you guys, and call it a week.
