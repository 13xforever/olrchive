And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 5th of 2007.
If you missed part A, our show is a little bit in limbo tonight, or a little bit broken.
First off, we have no Jamie tonight.
She's unfortunately had a family emergency, so we all are of course thinking about her at this time.
And definitely we'll be seeing her next week after she's got all that taken care of.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So it takes forever.
So we're here from the temporary Studio Loki and that's where we are tonight.
So if you notice a lot of our usual sound effects are missing or we kind of sound different, that's a big reason why.
But we're really excited about the new studio.
It's going to be so much more space than before.
I'm just worried about, it is a garage, it's an insulated garage, but I'm just worried about the heat issues.
And the echo because it's got a bad echo problem too.
We'll see.
We're going to try and make it work by next week.
So we're hoping to pull through for you for episode number 242.
In the meantime, let's get back into some gaming news.
And we're going to start off with some big news on the Xbox 360.
Big, big news on the Xbox 360.
The $50 price break has been all but confirmed.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
is going to include Rockstar Table Tennis.
So you get a free game with it now, which is pretty awesome.
Even if the game is really only $20 because Rockstar Table Tennis was cut down in price, that's better than no game at all, right?
That is true, and they're still denying that they have a price cut coming, but I think we know better than that.
Usually Microsoft rumors end up to be true.
Yes, and of course that's made its rounds all over the internet.
Except that's not the only announcement coming this week.
Probably by now, by the time you download this podcast, you will have heard that all the new 360 systems coming out as of this week and into infinity, I guess, will now all have HDMI.
So...
Don't have to spend the big bucks for the elite.
Even the core.
Even the core system will have HDMI.
My theory of the core system, that's totally baseless, other than the fact that I just feel that not a lot of people are buying the core system, and there's some other stories that kind of collaborate that later in the show.
Wait a minute, so I don't understand how that works.
What about all the systems that are already out there?
Are they going to be coming off the shelves to make room for these HDMI-enabled machines, or what's going to happen?
No, it's just they'll have this extra SKU out there, and I don't know, maybe they'll drop the price even more.
Huh.
Very interesting.
So it's going to have all HDMI on it.
So now, is that to be competitive with PlayStation 3, or is that because too many people were bitching about the Elite is the only way to go to get that?
I mean, if you think about it, it's not a big surprise, because look at the Halo 3 system.
I mean, that's supposed to be coming out in September here.
And it's not a big surprise.
That's why they haven't announced the price for that yet, if you think about it, because...
You know, people will be like, well, hey, you know, isn't that supposed to be, if they announced it at like $399 or something, or $349 or whatever, people will be like, hey, well, why would I want to buy a premium system like buy the Halo one for, you know, the same price with HDMI?
Now, Alex Silvara in chat has a very excellent point.
I was thinking the same thing when I first heard this, is that, hmm, I need to figure out how to red ring my premium so I can get an HDMI model.
A hammer.
No, but seriously, could you use that warranty to your advantage?
Like somehow force your 360 to give you the red rings so when they send you a refurb, it has HDMI?
Well, you could wrap a towel around it and play it in an oven.
Try to overheat it?
Place it in an oven.
I don't know.
I don't know what happened, Mr. Gates.
I'm not recommending that you do that, but I'm just saying.
No, and this is not a real big deal because the systems out there right now, they don't have HDMI, but who cares?
I mean, I guess it sucks if you already bought one, but for a person like me, I don't have any HDMI TV, I could care less.
I know, is HDMI really that big a deal?
I mean, because I have a feeling the internet's going to make this story this week sound like this big, huge freaking deal.
And the other thing is that I'm guessing it will not have an HDMI cable with it either.
But the reason why is because there will be a cable that's coming out as well.
All this is going to be, you'll probably all know this by the time you hear the podcast.
So, you know, because also, of course, there was that GameStop thing, the leak to the internet that said, you know, the announcement's going to be made by the 8th or Wednesday.
So, yeah.
Not a big surprise, but...
Well, you know, this kind of supplements what Loki was saying earlier about possibly the core is going away completely.
Apparently, Xbox, there's rumors going around that Microsoft has plans to make a hard disk drive a requirement to play games.
In other words, that, I think, one Sega game a little while back had a long time ago.
You're going to start seeing them more games.
It was on, yeah, Sega Pro Soccer or something or other.
I don't know.
Some soccer...
Well, that the hard disk drive will actually be required for some later games.
That was on the early pack shot, too, for Call of Duty 4.
Now, you might remember that the original Xbox, they all had hard drives, and they would use the hard drive to their advantage.
It would take data off the disk, uncompress it, and then put it on the hard drive temporarily.
And so, basically, the loading times are smaller.
And if you've ever played Oblivion without a hard drive versus with a hard drive, very similar type of concept there.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know many Xbox 360 owners without a hard drive unless they are seriously only buying a 360 for Madden or only buying it for select games.
Very, very casual types of 360 gamers.
Any, I think, hardcore gamer with a 360 probably has a hard drive.
So, also this week, you know, that was pretty... Sorry, I just want to go chat really, really quick, because some good points here.
RossDLUT says, of course, Final Fantasy XI, another very big game that requires a hard drive on the Xbox 360, of course.
Hello.
WonderDogHerald would like to point out, HDMI is a big deal when you spend $2,000 on a TV.
I think he bought a TV that was like $2,000.
I think he did.
I remember that.
RavensDolphin says Orange Launch Radio enforces bricking Xbox 360s.
No, we do not encourage you to brick your 360s because there's no guarantee you're going to get one replaced with HDMI.
SonOfDad is being very bold and says, HDMI is a big deal for snobs.
The other thing I'd like to mention, though, that Rockstar Table Tennis bundle that's out there,
and so on.
There's three different SKUs that they have.
They have Rockstar's Table Tennis, Top Spin 2, which both of those have kind of leaked out on the internet now, and Amp 3 was the last one that they had that I didn't see anyone having that, but then again, the game's out of print also, so it wouldn't surprise me, though, if they had maybe Ridge Racer, that'd be kind of cool, but those three I know were being sold in January as well, so that's probably also why the one that they did leak with Top Spin 2, I think,
had a price of $3.99.
Now this is kind of interesting because you remember last week or two weeks ago we were here back here on the show we were talking about Halo on the DS we talked about like how Microsoft games could they really come out for the DS and I think even one of the emails are gonna get to later gets into this but it should be noted that at Comic-Con during a Viva Pinata panel of all things did you go to the Viva Pinata panel at Comic-Con?
Totally didn't.
I figured.
Rare has actually announced they are going to be releasing a Nintendo DS version of Viva Pinata.
So kind of interesting there.
Rare is actually developing it themselves.
It's not a copy of the Xbox 360 game.
It's different.
Gameplay-wise, they say it's the same game, but it is going to be a different game.
So kind of interesting because that's weird because Rare is obviously a Microsoft subsidiary now and now they're putting out a game on the Nintendo DS.
But at the same time, it makes a lot of sense.
If Xbox is not getting into the handheld realm anytime soon, lots of kids have Nintendo DSs.
Viva Pinata is not just a game on the 360, but a cartoon series.
They're trying to draw in the kids and make it a new Pokemon type thing.
Here's the thing I'm wondering.
Who's going to be publishing this game?
Is it going to be Microsoft?
Because that would be interesting if it's Microsoft publishing it, or if it's actually going to be Rare developing it and Nintendo publishing it.
Who knows?
Who knows?
I don't think it says here.
I guess it says.
The article says it sounds like Microsoft is publishing it, but I don't think we know that for sure just yet, and I could be wrong, though.
Anyways, so another thing also that's very interesting and kind of a little weird, the new X and A package for PC, you might remember Microsoft's kind of game development kit,
actually has support for Wiimotes, for inputs for using that.
So that's a little interesting that you can make gesture-controlled games for Windows-based PCs.
Wait, so, I mean, because people with XNA can play these games that they make on their Xbox 360, correct?
Yeah.
So, in other words, people are going to be able, now they're going to have Viva Pinata on the DS, and they can build games that use the Wiimotes...
Not necessarily.
They have different libraries for both the PC and the 360.
So it's not going to allow you to play Wii games or games that use the Wii Remote on your Xbox 360, but you can play them on your PC.
Oh, that makes sense.
Because I was going to say, how can you plug in that infrared bar?
You can't.
It's just the Wiimote and the sensors that are in that, the accelerometers and all that.
You really need to plug in the bar anyways because it's just two infrared lights.
I guess that's true.
That's still kind of interesting.
It doesn't have Bluetooth on it, so it'd be a little hard to connect those Wii remotes to the system.
Ross Steel UT in our chatroom would like to point out Microsoft has published for DS before.
There was a MechaSalt game for it.
So there you go.
And Ross Steel UT also says, this only proves that Microsoft is smart enough to stay the fuck away from the portable market.
There you go.
Raven's Dolphin says it's a fair trade.
They get Viva Pinata and they get Wiimote.
But that's not – I mean to say Microsoft is getting the Wiimote, that's a little bit jumping to conclusions because I think it's – this is a very minor thing, and it's not like XNA games.
I don't think we've seen anything made in XNA actually go to the marketplace yet unless that – what about that – what was it?
Aegis Wing?
Was that an XNA game?
The one they give out for free?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's like the only one though that I can think of that actually has gone to life.
There are more coming, it's just that's the first one.
But I don't think you're going to just like see suddenly a random game that requires Wiimotes.
For the exact reason that Loki brought up before, it's only really going to work on the PC.
It's just kind of interesting.
I mean, there's really no other word for it that I can think of.
It's just interesting that these worlds are colliding like this.
So, go figure.
Let's see.
Also interesting is a release that's coming out in Japan.
It's getting Japan all prepped for Halo 3 because, of course, Halo 3, you know it's going to be a big deal in this country, but in Japan, eh...
Did it top the Amazon list at one point?
for roughly the equivalent of $25 US is a history pack.
It's the Halo history pack.
It's Halo and Halo 2.
And they're releasing... Obviously, these were Xbox games, but they are going to release them in Japan, I guess, with discs that have built-in backwards compatibility updates on them.
So you just can pop them in the Xbox 360s in Japan.
And I guess the thought is that maybe this will get some hype going for Halo 3.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm not eating right now, so ha!
I'm done eating.
Anywho, there's going to be... Halo 3 pre-orders are everywhere, including 7-Eleven now.
Yes, you can go buy a Slurpee or a Simpsons-themed item, and you can also pre-order Halo 3.
Why?
Why?
I guess.
It's just weird because you don't usually think of 7-Eleven as a place to go get your games.
But honestly, if that's a nationwide thing, has that been confirmed to be nationwide?
What's going on?
I don't know.
Is that franchise to franchise?
I would think probably franchise to franchise.
If they did that around here, I might seriously consider it.
I mean, who else is going to pre-order at freaking 7-Eleven?
I always thought 7-Eleven was a place to go play Street Fighter 2.
DJ Dark Knight says they sold Halo 2 at 7-Eleven too.
Apparently a lot of people are forgetting about that.
Bandit says, the week, and again, all these comments coming from our live chat room, chat.orangelantre.com.
Bandit says, the week Halo 3 comes out, so many 7-Elevens are going to get robbed.
So many of them.
And Jvmon says, didn't 7-Eleven have the Wii price in a contest ad once?
Sort of, but that was a contest.
Contests are different, I would think.
Alex Silvara says since they turned 7-Elevens into Quickie Marts maybe turn a few into Pillars of Autumn there you go turn them into some Halo themed stores there that could be interesting and expensive very expensive and ridiculous yeah it would be a little bit ridiculous where the hell am I
There's a brand new Xbox 360 repair website.
If you head on over in your browser in Internet Explorer or Firefox to service.xbox.com, there's a brand new site just set up pretty much to deal with the Red Rings of Death and other things related to Xbox 360 failures.
It's all automated now, and it's probably to reduce the stress on those poor call center reps that have to take all your angry calls.
You can register your console on the site, schedule the repairs, and keep track of them all through the website.
And the site will also give you a $5 discount just in case your Xbox 360 is outside of warranty, like if it's not related to the Red Rings of Death or whatever, since I'm sure that's money that's being saved on the customer service end from not having to actually talk to you.
Ooh, $5 discount off of, like, what, $150 to repair that thing?
That's a little ridiculous.
This is extremely sad news for me.
Grand Theft Auto 4 has been delayed to next year.
I cannot tell you the utter disappointment that I've had.
I know at work, all of our Grand Theft Auto group, very disappointed.
But I guess the reason was, it just wasn't done yet.
Big game.
Want to make sure it's perfect.
And it just can't get done.
You know, but outside of you, the general consensus I'm feeling from the internet blogs and the internet websites is it's okay.
Now we have more time to play the other games that are all coming out this holiday season as well.
Like, it's more Halo time.
It's more Mass Effect time.
It's more, you know, whatever the hell you're playing.
Metroid Prime, whatever.
Now, if you've got to look at this, very interesting, though.
I mean...
This actually, I think, hurts Sony, because if you look at it, Sony for, you know, first party titles and stuff coming out in the fall, they had, like, Heavenly Sword, Lair, Ratchet and Clank Future, and, you know, I guess SingStar or not, Eye of Judgment, I mean...
Those aren't... I mean, Heavenly Sword is going to be awesome.
Lair is going to be pretty awesome.
And then Ratchet & Clank, you know, definitely a good game.
But those don't sell systems.
Grand Theft Auto 4 would sell systems.
And I know it's ridiculous because, yeah, it's coming out on the 360 as well.
But still, you know, some people are Sony loyalists and they will buy their system when the game comes out.
There really is something about that PlayStation name that is going to keep a lot of people with PlayStation.
But here's the thing.
Now that it's not coming out...
People are going to start thinking, hey, I just can't wait anymore.
Now you've got Halo 3 coming out.
It's going to sell even more now that there's nothing competing with it, at least around that same time.
Plus, Microsoft has a really strong lineup for the fall.
Shit, that's going to really hurt them.
I mean, granted, the game's gonna still sell like crazy when it comes out, because now there's gonna be nothing competing with it, but that's still more time and less units out there for Sony, and that's also more opportunity for them to lose even more exclusives if they can't have a good holiday season.
What about the rumors that part of the reason of the delay is the PlayStation 3 development and that it's coding problems?
Somebody just brought that up in chat, and also I remember reading that somewhere.
But I don't know.
There's part of me that felt that that was a little bit fanboyish.
I didn't know whether to believe it or not.
I don't know if it's true or not.
I mean, I could see it because there are a lot of games lately from all different publishers and all different developers that have been delayed on the PlayStation 3 end because it is hard to develop for.
They're not used to it.
They're used to developing for the 360.
and you know just developing for the sell is a lot harder so it's possible I don't think it's true but I just think the game is just not done it was a pretty aggressive deadline there they're trying to meet and you know they probably just want to make sure it's perfect because the game is going to be open to a crap load of scrutiny right hell yeah so especially from our very own Loki
All right, well, you know, that's not the only game to get delayed.
I know probably not quite as many of you were looking forward to this.
It's opened up to say that Blacksite Area 51, of course, Area 51 being one of their popular shooting games.
Well, this new Area 51 game was coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
It has been bumped back to November 5th, which isn't a huge delay.
I mean, it's not like what we're looking at for the other games there, but it has been bumped back to November.
And funny enough, there's no demo for the PlayStation 3 yet on their service.
I think there was one supposed to be coming out later this month.
Possibly development issues.
And there's another thing also, too, that we're forgetting about, and I'm going to cover this right now.
There's another game delayed, Lair, which is supposed to be coming out actually next week.
It's now coming out on September 4th.
and the reason why it's being delayed is to enhance community features in the game because if you remember, Lair is going to be one of the first games that supports home in both their trophy system as well as being able to launch the game from home and stuff like that so some of these games also coming out in the fall may be delayed with some of those features in mind as well
Interesting.
That doesn't seem like that huge of a delay, though.
Is that really enough time to fix everything?
I guess it is.
Huh.
Strange.
Alright, well, we're going to get into the mailbag.
We can't delay that anymore.
It's been two weeks coming, and we want to get to your emails and hear from some of you folks.
And unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here tonight, but filling in tonight for the mailbag is the one and only Miklatov.
Me!
A.K.A.
Shane.
So, unfortunately, we don't have the music tonight, so I'll sing.
I don't know how it goes.
Which one is the mailbag?
Oh, yeah, we're used to singing the song off-sync.
Alright, whatever.
Get into the mailbag.
Who emailed us this week?
Well, the first one is from Richard.
I'm not going to say his last name because that might be inappropriate.
You could use the last initial.
M. The letter M. It says, hey guys, I just felt like saying hi because you guys are so cool.
It was a real bummer you didn't have a show last week.
It feels like it's been longer though.
Also, I just found my Golden Sun game and was wondering did you ever like playing it?
Because it seriously, to me, lacks the information giving.
Meaning it doesn't always let me know where I need to go or do.
And is the new Tales of game for PSP any good?
And I already said who it was by, so I'm not going to say it again.
and he needs to learn how to use commas because he used them incorrectly.
Oh my god, it's just like having Jamie here.
Shane's complaining about the grammar of the emails.
This is amazing.
I'm sorry.
I honestly don't know a lot.
I played the crap out of Golden Sun.
Well, then you answer that.
I loved it up until I put it down for two days and he's dead on where it doesn't tell you what you're supposed to do ever.
So putting it down for two days meant I couldn't play it anymore because I forgot what I was doing and there was nothing to help me figure out what I was doing.
Except for the internet, and I don't think I really used the internet much at that time when it came out.
But yeah, it's a great game if you remember what you're doing or keep track of it.
I don't know anything about a Tales game.
Loki, do you know anything about a Tales game?
There was a Tales game... There's a new Tales game I know coming out.
I haven't heard too much about it, though.
I will try to read up on it very quickly while you read the next email.
Look how long this is.
Did I have to read it all?
Yeah, just read it.
Okay, this is from Scott L. Wait, crap, he has like a pseudonym at the bottom.
Maybe I'll just wait till that.
That's not from Scott L at all.
Hey Yet Again was listening to this week's Part B and had a couple of responses.
1.
I had a 360 break on me with the disc scratching problem.
This was one day after I bought it and had originally set it up on my coffee table while I made sure I had everything set up correctly. 2.
Once it was running smoothly, I gently picked it up to move it onto my entertainment center, and next thing I knew, I heard a horrible loud grinding sound.
I had only lifted it about an inch off the table, and had lifted it gently without tilting it at all.
It not only ruined my disc, but when I put it
When I put another disc in it, I don't want to read this anymore.
This is really long and boring.
Okay, the gist of what he's saying is it scratched that disc as well once he put another one in to test it.
And he learns his error of his ways.
Exactly.
Don't move the system while it's on.
He says it was near the system's launch and he had no idea it would happen.
he has had lots of machines that uses disks from PS1 on as well as PCs and I've never had this happen before when I moved them he got a replacement and things have been smooth sailing at first but he wanted to let everyone know that the disk scratching problem is a blatant fault in the 360 hardware and can happen with the slightest movement it doesn't require shaking or tilting it even though it sounds like any sort of jostling just picking it up is enough to break it
MechaSoul and Age of Empires Halo Halo
Cheers, y'all.
Hero antagonist.
You're the worst email reader ever.
Did you see how long this is, though?
We just kept going on and on.
Then summarize.
I did.
I tried.
Really quickly, the chat room has some comments here about where we did not know much about the Tales of series.
Our chat room fills in here.
Alex Silvara says, Tales of the World, Radiant Mythology for the PSP.
Simply, it's awesome.
Oh, that's right.
That's the game that came out.
And Zappy says the PSP Tales of is a fan service for Tales of fan.
There you go.
Hooray.
Next email is from Reesimo.
Hey guys, I've been a faithful listener for about a year and a half now.
I've been in the chat room a few times, but I'm often too busy to listen to you live, so I just download the podcast to my PSP.
I think the three of you offer so much to the gaming community and find it sad that many gamers that listen to podcasts haven't heard of you.
The end!
Come on, keep going.
I love the extreme sarcasm and angst that Jamie offers.
Matt's rants are incredibly entertaining.
And Rob is just too fracking adorable.
I know you're moving... Oh, the word was fucking?
Was that the word, Shane?
There's more, there's more.
Hey, I'm adorable.
That's great.
I know you're moving the studio soon and just wanted to know about any possible changes.
I really hope you guys add video.
Please consider it.
Loki, I agree with you on the zapper.
Just try to homosexual your anger a little.
I don't even know what that means.
Sound Voyager for the GBA Unfortunately, it's an import only from Japan, but since it's handheld, it's region-free
Anyway, I've not played the game, but according to reviews, it's supposedly more enjoyable to play this game with your eyes closed.
If you or anyone else is interested, now is a good time to pick it up from PlayAsia because it's on sale for $15.
Ooh, those are all the bit generation games.
I bought one of them, which I didn't like.
Sound Voyager?
No, it wasn't Sound Voyager.
I saw... But, I mean, that's one of the bit generation ones.
Yeah, that's one of them.
It's generation two, I think, but...
They're awesome games for the Game Boy Advance.
Just be careful.
There's one I got Colorists or whatever that's not very fun.
I didn't really know how to play it.
It ends with hope this helps some people out.
Apollo.
Hooray.
That was a good email.
It's not a happy email.
Unlike the one that was just complimenting you or the guy that writes too much.
You're rude.
Alright, if you want to send an email, we promise Jamie will be back next week.
She's just as mean as I am.
Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.
Maybe we're going to have Loki read them.
He's a little nicer.
Who can we get in here that's nice to the listeners?
I'm nice.
Not when you have to write a whole crap about stuff that's not interesting.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
And now it looks like homosexual your anger might be the new catch line.
I started something worse.
Like what?
Than what you had before.
I don't understand how the last one makes sense, what you guys said, but I don't understand how this one makes even more sense.
It had something to do... It was that week that the game, we speculated, we didn't know that the word was spastic.
Some video game had the word spastic in it, and we speculated that the word was retarded, because we didn't realize the cultural differences.
I don't...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Laura Roslin Talk a little more about sports games
Remember that whole you're an asshole thing we were talking about earlier?
I like winning 11.
There we go.
Well, there you go.
Do you like Major League Baseball Power Pros?
Oh, the Konami game.
Well, it's Konami and 2K Sports.
That's what makes this interesting.
The two of them are actually teaming up to put out this game.
Oh, what system is it for?
It is coming out for... That's a very good question.
I haven't gotten there yet.
Gosh, Nintendo Wii and something like that.
Yeah, I totally saw that in the office.
It looked awesome.
Are you even allowed to tell us that?
What office is left?
Okay.
Seriously.
Can you tell us more?
It was adorable because everybody had big heads and big eyes.
And it was pretty cool.
I don't know.
I just saw people playing it.
Well, the press release boasts that there's a dozen different game modes in the game.
It's going to have long-term playability.
It'll have, of course, a season mode, as most sports games do.
Success mode, as well.
In season mode, you become a Major League Baseball team general manager.
And, of course, what is the ultimate goal?
To win the World Series.
Success mode, though, has more traditional role-playing elements and other baseball scenarios in it.
And they're calling this mode unique and compelling, which, you know, of course, press releases.
I don't think it's either of those, but it did look like a lot of fun.
So I would highly recommend it if you like baseball games.
And that's what it's really about.
to some people.
It's not going to be the graphics, that's for sure.
See, and now there's people in chat going, no, don't talk about sports games, or Raven's Dolphin says, Sky talking baseball makes me want to go kill myself.
I love going to baseball games.
I'm just saying the games are kind of boring as of late.
It's cheapy and cute.
I mean...
Even I love baseball stars on the internet.
There's the occasional sports game that I will... Like the Ken Griffey games were really fun on the Super Nintendo.
Or like Double Dribble.
How can you not love NBA Jam?
Hello.
Yeah, but... You know, just because you don't play Madden doesn't mean you have to hate all sports games.
Yeah, that's true.
I mean, Madden is just a little hardcore for maybe some people that don't follow football.
Maybe it's a bit much.
Football's fun to watch, but it's not... I don't understand it.
If you play racing games, that's a sport.
Hello.
They tried to make DDR a sport, guys.
Come on.
Well, that's a whole nother, you know...
Sports games can be good.
This one, if you like baseball and you don't mind cute little things, it's going to be good.
One thing that may be good if you're holding out for All-Pro Football 2K8, apparently sales of All-Pro Football 2K8 were...
Okay, I guess.
I guess 2K was not terribly pleased and not terribly disappointed.
So, the rumor is that it may be dropping price with the upcoming Madden release.
So, if it's going to drop price, that would probably be by next week then, since, well, that's when Madden comes out.
I don't know, looks pretty cool.
I did see some funny videos though online of OJ Simpson and there was this one team, I can't remember what it was, but they had a, one of their mascots was this guy with a knife and he was stabbing.
It was funny, so the fun things you can do with all pro football.
OL Army Ninja in chat says, you guess a lot, Loki.
Yeah.
Super Smash Bros.
Brawl
Super Smash Bros.
Melee
Here's a quote from the story.
It's really something you won't see anywhere else.
That sounds kind of cool, because it sounds like it could be something that's almost by itself.
Go figure.
Something else I want to say really quickly, though, because I noticed it didn't make the show roll.
There's some other information that hit the Smash Bros.
Dojo this week at SmashBrothers.com, and that is another newcomer.
It's Ike.
And Ike you may have never heard of before, unless you play Fire Emblem, because Ike comes from the Fire Emblem series.
He comes from, I think, the GameCube one, which probably sold about five copies.
Well...
Well, whatever you feel about Fire Emblem, Ike is going to be one of the characters in the game.
It's just like a character you'd have a crush on, Miklatov.
I totally do, because he's got blue hair.
Well, hopefully the Wii version is going to sell a little bit more, because they do have the Wii one coming out in November here.
Okay, Loki, I have a question for you, because Shane's going to yell at me if I say this.
Loki, is his hair blue or purple?
From here, it looks kind of dark blue.
Oh, your eyes suck.
It's purple to me.
There's this inside.
It's not even a joke.
It's true.
It's indigo.
I swear his hair is purple.
Well, I'll fight you for it.
It looks a little, it's bluey purple.
Well, I'll tell you, well, I don't know.
Another interesting thing, we've talked about this numerous times before, but the Neo Geo is coming to the Virtual Console, and now it is confirmed on Nintendo's Virtual Console website in Japan.
They do show the Neo Geo there, and also have a spot for another console that's yet unnamed.
Dreamcast, Commodore 64, MSX There's also Elevator Action, which is now called Spy Game Elevator Action
It's gross.
But it's true.
There's no games that you get that super excited about.
Silent Hill.
See?
Pump It Up.
That's gross.
Whatever, both of those games are amazing.
You did see that there's a new Pump It Up coming again to PSP.
I actually was talking to Rob about that today and I wanted to cry.
And I was making fun of him because the game will probably have his favorite pump song of all time in it.
It probably will and it's really going to make me sad.
Which for the record is Lizenka.
Yes.
I don't know if you like any of these songs.
I mean, maybe Guitar Hero 3 will make you feel better, Miklatov.
There is one song on there that does make me feel better.
Oh, I'm curious to know what it is.
There are some new songs that were just announced.
And of course, it seems like...
Whenever there's a new Guitar Heroes game, whether it's the 80s edition or the 30s, it seems like the songs keep slowly rolling out to keep this game in the press.
I will tell you no or yes when you read off the list.
Miss Murder by A.I., Threes and Sevens by Queen of the Stone Age, Raining Blood by Stare, Reptilia by The Strokes, Paranoid by Black Sabbath, Cities on Flame by Blue Oyster Cult, Mississippi Queen by Mountain.
You didn't read enough.
That's it.
That's the seven new songs.
No, there's another new one.
I swear.
There was a dragon in there which they showed the- That video was crazy.
Through the fire and flames.
Yes.
Oh my god.
I don't know why.
It does remind me of stuff you'd see in like Guitar Freaks and stuff.
Yeah.
Just insanely fast.
Made no sense really.
It's just like, oh my god.
I like Cherub Rock by the Smashing Pumpkins.
That looks like it would be cool.
Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones.
That's kind of awesome.
Sabotage by Beastie Boys.
Hey, this might be tenacious D songs in there.
My Name is Jonas by Weezer.
I'm still thinking that Rock Band is going to outdo this.
From everything I understand about them two.
I'll probably buy them both because I'm such a whore for music games.
I don't know.
Have you seen footage of Guitar Hero 3 since Neversoft took it over?
Yeah.
It looks kind of weird.
It's alright.
DDR looked kind of weird when it went over to the Xbox, but you get used to it.
It still kind of looks weird.
I like how you can give us a more honest opinion now.
I don't think I ever was not honest about how I felt about the game.
Shane, what do you think about DDR Hottest Party?
I think it's a piece of crap.
Oh, man.
I'm way too honest.
We probably ought to move on to the next topic, Loki.
Yeah, speaking of weird and kind of crappy...
Guitar Hero.
It's been spotted in the arcade.
Actually, they had a wonderful shot of it on Kotaku.
It was a game in a Bangkok arcade.
What's funny about it is there's no guitar.
It's just Guitar Hero.
Why are you giggling at him talking about a game in Bangkok if you don't have a perverted mind, Shane?
No, I'm not laughing at that.
I'll tell you later.
Go on with your story.
What's funny though is the whole game looks like poppin' music.
It's got basically giant buttons for each of the fret buttons and I guess you play it a little bit like poppin' music.
One might say though it's kind of ripping off of Beatmania so that's kind of ironic.
So all you do is you just hit the buttons down and that's like an automatic strumming too?
I don't know, but it would just be poppin' music.
I was just saying it's poppin' music.
Poppin' Hero.
That's a terrible name.
It sounds like a popcorn game.
By the way, I just want to point out, this is what Shane's doing during the show.
You know why he started laughing?
It had nothing to do with the whole Bangkok thing.
He's reading Big Brother 8 live updates and giggling at them and the housemates calling each other dirty names.
That's what really goes on here in the OLR studio.
Hey, don't get off topic.
Continue with your video games discussion.
Oh, okay, I will.
So would you play Guitar Hero in the arcade if it was like poppin' music?
I may try it once just to say that I played it, and that's about it.
I like poppin' in the arcade.
It would be fun.
It would be cool.
I'm sure it's like playing Unjama Lamy in the arcade, which I played one time.
Unjama Lamy.
It was very strange.
First off, it's made for little kids, so I had to get on my knees to play this game.
Shut up!
Because I'm really tall, unlike little Asian girls, and I had to squat down to play.
Never mind, I'm not going to finish the story.
Was it like trying to use a little kid urinal or something like that?
Like they did in Billy Madison, where he has to squat down and he falls over?
Let's see.
Ross Steel UT says you hit the buttons.
Isn't that every fucking rhythm game ever?
Kinda.
Hit them with your feet, hit them with your hands, hit them with the strumming, hit them with your voice.
You can't hit buttons with your voice.
You can if you sing really bad.
Some people say my voice pushes people's buttons.
Dead Air
That rumbles.
And yes, we've been hearing this story on and off, and Loki has been insisting for weeks and weeks that yes, this is coming.
But apparently, various Sony developers do have their hands on the 6-axis with rumble.
Rumor is it could be their big announcement at the convention in Germany, the Leipzig convention.
Congratulations for spending $499 on your brand new 60-gig PlayStation 3 system.
Also, congratulations, you're now going to have to buy new controllers.
Thank you.
What's also funny is they actually did come out.
Why not?
The same thing happened on PS1 and PS2.
Oh, yeah.
Wait.
But they didn't say Rumble is last generation then.
PS1 didn't have the little analog sticks.
PS2 didn't have Rumble to begin with.
I have a PS2 controller that doesn't have Rumble.
Really?
Yes.
I swear they had... I bought mine at launch.
They had it at launch.
Then why the fuck doesn't my PlayStation 2 controller rumble?
Is it broken?
No.
Are you sure it's a PlayStation 2 controller?
I'm sure.
It could be just an... A black PS1 controller?
Yeah, they had those.
Did they?
Son of a bitch.
Yeah, because I remember I bought mine at launch and it worked.
All right, God.
I failed, Jesus.
I do remember, though, having to buy the DualShock controllers at one time, so yeah, that makes sense.
But...
You know, this is something that they took away and now they're putting back.
But they said they justified taking it away because it was a last generation feature.
Oh, okay.
Because Rumble is so last gen.
Welcome to last gen, Sony.
They're all, well, last gen sold better than this gen, so let's go back.
I think that's what they're doing.
They're like, maybe if we can just make it like the PS2, it'll sell.
Anyways.
Anyways.
So, another interesting thing, Warhawk is finally, the price point has been announced.
We knew before that the retail version was going to be $59.99, and that was going to include a Bluetooth headset, as well as some extra bonus behind-the-scenes crap.
And now the online version, probably the most expensive download I think you'll ever see on a console, well, so far at least.
is $39.99 to download this game.
You thought Luminous was expensive.
Actually, if you add it up, if you add up the game itself and then all the fucking little packs they have with it, maybe it's getting close.
It's probably about $25.
That's before we even get to packs.
I mean, what makes you think that Warhawk's not going to have downloadable content?
Good point, good point.
All right, so are you going to buy this, though?
Nope.
No.
I do not like online-only multiplayer games.
That's true.
No more MMOs?
That's what turned me off to... MMOs are different.
This is just like straight, you know, online-only multiplayer.
It feels like half a game to me.
It's like taking the online portion of your single-player first-person shooter and just, well, we didn't feel like creating this story, so let's just make the game.
Okay, the chat room is all like saying, you know, and I appreciate the chat room and their comments, but they're all like, Sky, have you turned on the rumble and the various games?
Give me a little credit here, people.
I mean, okay, I've been doing an internet radio program about video games with my friends for five years.
Okay, give me a little bit of the benefit of the doubt that I know how to turn these features on in games and check and see, you know, all this stuff.
I realize I'm not perfect, and I don't get things right all the time.
We're human, but please.
I'm trying to remember if yours even has the little button in the middle to turn on.
It does.
And we're back, folks.
Sorry about that.
We don't know what happened.
I can tell you what happened.
This Skype mess with the settings there.
Well, live radio, boys and girls.
We're in the temporary studio.
What can you do?
These things happen.
Now, I don't know what the last thing the folks heard was, though, before we went to the Skype line.
So quickly give us the last story again real quick there.
Sorry, folks.
Live radio.
Things happen.
The last story?
Like which story?
Story about the start of the read?
Okay.
Okay, anyways, so we were going to cover one story that we ran on the website about the Tokyo Game Show list for Sega.
That makes me sad.
And that looks really awesome.
It's such a wonderful list.
Even like Fighters Megamix 2 and stuff.
I was like, oh, hell yeah.
New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio.
New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio, yeah.
Guess what?
It's fake.
Because it was too much of a Sega fanboy's dream.
And we posted that on our website.
Awesome job.
Awesome job, everybody.
Now, how did it get debunked?
The original source actually has posted a retraction and apology.
Saying, we lied because we made all of those up because people wanted to hear that.
Yeah, so they are a big douche, apparently.
It says...
There has been a lot of controversy regarding the recently posted rumor regarding Sega's possible Tokyo Game Show lineup.
Now, I was originally very defensive of this piece, and because of who sent it in, his longtime go-to guy named Rob has sent me exclusive tips of four years, and until this most recent one, all were accurate.
and apparently Rob says sorry guys says that I'm sorry for this whole AMS I assure you that this is not this will not happen again I have to say I applaud you guys for being right on top of this
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I think really some of those games sounded plausible up until you hit Shenmue 3.
I can tell you one thing, though, that will be a Tokyo Game Show this year.
I don't know if you can get excited about this or not.
Probably not.
But a new Sonic Riders game, Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, will be there.
It's coming out on the Wii and PlayStation 2.
Actually, around the same time as the first one came out last year.
Around...
February, I believe.
If it was a new version of Sonic R with the same awesome music, maybe I'd care, but... Yeah, it's just not.
Riders was okay, it was an alright game, but... I don't know.
Put this away.
As long as it controls better than Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3 and 360.
I'm fine with that.
Ooh, that's a burn right there, because that game sucks.
All right, so I'm very sorry, guys.
We're not going to be able to do the Skype line tonight.
Live radio and things are broken and it's not running at the same time as our recording software does.
So that's okay.
We'll bring it back next week.
We'll take more calls next week to make up for it.
But we will do some Ask Orange Lounge tonight.
We do have our chat room is still working.
You guys can interact with us through that.
Thanks for watching!
You can probably go in there and adjust it so that it's lined in and stuff.
I don't know.
Do you even try?
I don't know.
At this point, let's just... Do we really want to break the show further tonight?
Yeah!
Might as well go all or nothing.
Let's go all the way, man.
Let's break the show.
Alright.
Well, there are some comments in chat about the whole Sega thing going on.
RossDLUT says, Sega doesn't know how to make good games anymore.
How could you not know this was fake?
They do ruin all their franchises they touch lately.
And also, if you looked at that list, that's a huge fucking list.
I mean, there's no way they're working on that much.
The only thing that was missing from it was like Panzer Dragoon Saga 2.
That was it.
Everything else is like, fanboy.
Um, let's see.
Raven's Dolphin says, no Skype.
Wow, OLR is having my kind of failure.
There you go.
DarkTetsuya said they should make a new Jet Set Radio for the Wii anyway.
Not for the Wii, make it for the 360.
DarkTetsuya says, or hell, a new Samba de Amigo.
Yes.
I found my Samba stuff.
I know, I saw them.
You see that they had a Samba de Amigo listed as a PSP title on it?
Yeah, what are you going to do, shake your stupid PSP?
Oh!
I like it.
Alright.
So we promised we'd do some Ask Orange Lounge, so I'm going to read some questions here from our chat room.
And unfortunately, we don't have the theme music unless Shane wants to sing it.
What's the theme music?
Same as the mailbag music, because we're cheap here on this program.
No, thank you.
All right, let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
Let's start off with this.
It's probably a stupid question indeed.
Well, it's from Raven's Dolphin.
Take it as you will.
Raven's Dolphin says, Sky, how come you do not talk about your iBook?
Because I got a MacBook and like it.
I'm playing with it, so he can't talk about it.
I like my iBook.
It's the only internet I have right now because that's how I'm able to steal the neighbor's Wi-Fi.
The screensaver is really pretty.
Well, you can choose from several different screensavers.
I don't know if you're aware.
I think there's much more to the Mac than just the screensaver.
I doubt it.
Oh, yeah.
There's being able to play WoW on it, but very badly because I can't fly down.
For me, who does a lot of work on the road and who travels a lot, it's great.
I love the Mac for that stuff.
And it's got a great DVD authoring program on it.
I will give it that.
Let's go to some more questions.
Of course, Ask Orange Lounge tonight in lieu of the Skype line.
Since we do not have the Skype line tonight.
DJ Janai asks, how was moving last week?
It was long and tedious, and I'm very glad to be done with it.
And the new house that I live in is so much better than the apartment I was in before.
With no disrespect to Extifer, because living with Extifer was fun, but just the place itself is so much better now.
We're in a house, there's actually a backyard and a lawn to mow.
Alex Silvara
Does anyone like the Dynasty Samurai Warriors series besides me?
Oh, I did hear there's a new incarnation coming out on Xbox 360.
They're gonna be doing Dynasty Warriors Gundam, that's coming out in August.
And then they've got that Warriors Orochi, which is coming out in September, which is pretty much Dynasty Warriors mixed with Samurai Warriors.
And to be honest, I couldn't tell the two apart.
And now there's Dynasty Warriors 6, which actually looks like they did something with the series and made it look a little bit better on 360, so...
I don't know.
Gameplay-wise, they haven't changed anything, but graphically, it looks like they haven't changed anything either, so... I don't know.
Not much I could really be excited about.
Although there is Samurai Warrior Katana later this year, so...
Going over to a question from RossDLUT.
Here's actually a really good question and something that wasn't brought up earlier in the show.
With the recent raids on mod chippers, the internet's pretty much gone nuts.
The question I have is, well, are people so selfish that they feel gamers shouldn't have to support game companies?
Personally, I'd rather XSEED were able to make profits than have 500 pirates to every one importer.
Interesting point.
I mean, because there's been those raids going on apparently about all these people that will mod chip your systems.
I'm very curious to hear what you think about this, Loki.
About modding and stuff like that?
And all the crackdowns and all that?
Well, I mean, what they're doing is violating the law, but at the same time, there's ways around things that you don't necessarily have to put a hardware mod chip into it in order to be able to play stuff from other countries.
I think also the problem is...
Like, with a lot of these things, you know, games are expensive now, don't get me wrong, but at the same time, you know, people are kind of jaded with paying 60 bucks and getting crap.
They're getting hosed, and like, they kind of justify it in a way, well, fuck this, I wasted, you know, 60 bucks on Bomberman Act Zero, and I thought it was going to be a really awesome game, and it's just crap.
You know, and now I can't get my money back, so...
Fuck you, I'm gonna steal your next game.
You know, there's that.
There's also, you know, with importing, I don't understand why more systems are like the PlayStation 3 and the PSP.
You know, let people import their games if they want to.
Hell, it sells an extra copy for you.
You still make some money off of it.
And, you know, I don't think it's really hurting anything.
Okay, it's gonna be a Japanese version of the game or something.
Big deal.
I think in the big scope of things, too, there's so few people that actually import in the big scope of gaming.
It's not that big a deal, I don't think.
I mean, hell, how else did Elite Beat Agents get a release here but from people importing on and on?
Exactly.
And you know what?
Hey, look, my buying... GS68 just said the same damn thing in chat.
My buying Wangan Midnight, that's a whole one extra copy for them, and you know why I bought it?
Because there's not a lot of stuff coming out over here.
So, what the hell?
Yeah, you know, but as far as just like pirating to get a bunch of games for free, especially when you're downloading things like Halo 3 and Blue Dragon, you know, assumably when these games come out, Blue Dragon, kind of like this stuff, you know, you know it's not going to be like Barman X Heroes.
It's a little different.
Let me put it this way.
That's not okay.
Yeah, my PSP is modded.
Yes, I can play games without having to buy them.
But would I have bought those games if it wasn't modded?
No, I wouldn't have.
I just play games that are from other countries just to check them out.
I normally don't end up buying them.
I would have felt bad if I actually bought them because they sucked.
It's also not like you don't buy video games.
I mean, you have a shitload of video games everywhere in this house, so you buy a lot of video games.
I spend a lot of money on video games, and you know what?
If I can play something for free instead of paying for it, yeah, I'll do it because it frees up more money for buying something else.
Legend of Zaku has this for Ask Orange Lounge.
Bring back the camera.
Bringing back the webcam would be hot.
It looks like it is going to happen in the new studio, but we're just not sure.
I mean, getting a webcam in there isn't a problem.
Now it's just about delivering it to the site.
So we will have more information on that later.
Yes, we've seen the suggestions about, I don't know what, Justin TV, Operator 11, whatever site Travis Donovan's using.
We're looking into what we want to use and we'll have more information on that later.
I even thought about doing something in here if we had time.
So I buried the Xbox Vision camera because I haven't used it for anything yet.
Something soon.
We will definitely have a cam in the new studio because the new studio will be awesome.
I hope.
How does it feel to be surrounded by grown gay men?
I don't get it.
I know.
What's the big deal?
I don't know.
Ban him.
He's homophobic.
He's the one that broke Gay Gamer.
Speaking of which, what do you think about that whole GayGamer.net getting targeted?
I felt really sad.
I met Flynn at Comic Con, and he's a really nice guy.
So somebody doing that to his site really kind of makes me mad.
Especially if it was all this hate crime and stuff.
That's so gay that somebody would do that.
NM64 says, how few frames per second do you predict your current PC would get while playing Crysis?
I think mine would die.
As it is, shit, until I upgraded the video drivers, which I think they were current, but for some reason it was having issues because I installed like three different sets of video drivers that were all running concurrent.
You know, ever since I did that, my computer before that was just resetting randomly.
It would just boop, stop.
I used to have that problem.
And I was like, fucking A, I'm going to have to buy another PC.
I did, though, this weekend, though, I bought a magazine because I'm actually looking to buy a new PC.
or BuildOne and unfortunately my dream PC is like $11,000 so I need to scale down quite a bit but they have a nice article this PC game or PC building bible they have build your own game PC under $1,400 and it looks nice and it's all blue I want an all blue PC somebody get me some paint I'll paint my PC and it'll be blue or Rob will say it's purple and try to trick me but it's not going to be it's going to be blue
What's a Commander Keen?
How old are you?
You're like a baby.
You weren't around for Commander Keen, were you?
Commander Keen was kind of like, I don't know, like ID's Mario game for the PC.
I don't know how else to explain it, really.
It was like a side-scrolling game.
It had like crazy demons from hell?
I don't think so, no.
Then what's the point?
It was fun, though.
A lot of folks that had computers in the 90s remember this game.
It was the shit on shareware.
That's right.
It was awesome.
And all about Jasper Shakur.
I actually did not... I heard that name, but I don't know what it is.
I heard some of their other stuff was coming to Steam, but I didn't know the old stuff was.
They didn't freeware release that stuff a long time ago?
I don't know.
Epic MegaGames ZZT
What would you do?
I was such a nerd that I spent so many hours making games.
You can make your own games.
It was like a programming language for games.
But it's hard to explain.
It's all using ASCII characters.
So your games would be very blocky and stuff.
But as it went on, they also released this new thing called MegaZooks where you can create your own.
That's a terrible name.
Your own games as well, but it was a little bit more intuitive.
They had, you know, ooh, mod music.
You could, you know, mod tracker stuff in there and just all sorts of interesting things.
I want to say, like, years ago on this show, like, we had an entire three-hour conversation about ZZT one night.
Like, it's crazy.
I have an excellent idea.
What, OLR the ZZT?
We need a contest, a game design contest in ZZT sponsored by OLR.
That would be awesome.
Alright, we'll work out the details and come up with that for a future program.
That would be awesome.
Is there still ZZT programming communities?
Oh, we can find it.
There's gotta be somewhere.
Shadowslayer says, I swear this guy is making these games up.
Put it on Wikipedia or something.
I'm not making this shit up.
ZZT is a real game.
Hitstun says, fuck the Unreal Engine, ZZT forever.
Amen.
God, your listeners are old.
Shut up.
Would you allow them to use SuperZZT or any of the other ZZT mods?
I didn't like SuperZZT.
If anything, we'd either do it in the original ZZT or we would do MegaZooks.
Because MegaZooks was pretty awesome.
You can do a lot of cool shit in that.
I want to have... I'm banging on the desk because I have a great idea.
You know, one thing I've said I wanted to do for Orange Lounge in our new season, we'll use a new studio, is more interviews.
We need to get people who made ZZT on the program.
Just to talk about ZZT.
I don't want to talk about it.
Interview me.
I wear a top hat and a monocle and a mustache so I can pretend I'm old.
You can pretend you're Colonel Mustard?
What?
He didn't wear a top hat.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
No.
How old do you think he is?
And he asked me how black and white TV was back in the day.
And I'm thinking, like, well, they used to show Dennis the Menace reruns on Nickelodeon in black and white, but that was about it.
I didn't know.
There was a time, though, that I did have an old ass... It was a 286 system.
It was like a 28620 or something like that with the whole...
32 megs of hard drive space and anyways so there was one game we had because we had just these really budget ass games it was like a what was it a Muppets game or something like that and because it was on a black and white monitor you had to play it on like a CGA monitor or something like that which was you know four colors and they all sucked it was fucking hard to see it you couldn't see and you don't want to do the push a button or something so it just went blank screen finally one day we're like I think I see something on there and
And so we hit the button and then we found out, oh, look, the game sucks.
Loki, look at this.
It's a screenshot from the town of ZZT featuring the bank of ZZT.
The bank of ZZT.
And the whole program, that first, because you can play through, there's like this huge game and stuff that you can play through on there.
And then the actual, the game that it came with was locked, so you couldn't edit it.
But there was a program that you can hack the thing and actually unlock it.
And man, the bank little program thing was kind of complicated.
It was pretty cool looking.
Amazing.
I remember my friends, we used to be real into Robotech and shit, and he would make Robotech ZZT levels and all sorts of weird stuff.
Oh my god, I remember Code Red, which was one of the add-on packs for ZZT.
No, no, this huge series somebody made for ZZT.
There are a lot of really big series.
I mean, god, back in the day, I used to be so into that stuff.
Alright, we need to stop being so old.
We're gonna talk about this.
What, you got something else real quick?
No, I said we're gonna just keep talking about this if we don't.
I do have some last minute stories.
Yes, please.
They're interesting.
Well, I don't know if they're interesting, but we've got a picture of Big Brain Academy, the board game.
I love Big Brain Academy on the DS.
That could be cool.
And it looks like it comes with your own, I don't know, crack scale?
Because there's like a weird scale on there.
I guess that's what that is, some sort of drug scale.
Train your brain to smoke more crack.
So that's kind of interesting.
The Wii Remote's getting yet another strap.
Yay!
Hooray for straps!
Give it up for straps, everybody!
Alright!
Those Wii remotes are strapped, yo!
That's all I got.
That's it.
Alright, thank you.
No, but don't they have little clasps on them?
Yeah, there's straps with clasps on them.
Alright.
Woo, upgrades.
Oh, yeah.
Jaden has a tip for you, Shane, if you want to experience what black and white TV was like.
Turn the color setting all the way down on your color TV and you'll have a black and white TV.
Why would I do that?
I don't even know how to do that on my TV.
Because you wanted to know what watching black and white TV was like, so there you go.
Or watch the Purple Network.
I'll flip you off.
I thought you didn't swear.
That's not.
It's my fingers.
I remember having an old-ass TV and trying to... I was like, ooh, I get 13 channels.
That sucks.
Let's see if I can tune anything on in UHF.
Oh, no.
I get one Spanish channel, and that's about it.
NERD
Whatever.
I hate you.
Alright, we're going to wrap it up.
Let me talk about something old and boring.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for tonight.
Shane, thank you for being here and contributing your unique perspective to our program.
You're welcome.
And your final thought, please.
I want to play the new expansion because it's blue and not purple, so shut up.
My final thought is I want to go see a movie because...
Yeah, I do.
I want to see Harrisburg.
I want to see a movie because I'm sick of moving and unpacking boxes.
So movie.
I'll think about it.
All right, thank you.
I will.
Loki, your final thought.
My final thought is yet another last-minute story, and it was Nestor J, the NES emulator, just got released on the PSP version 1.11 RM.
which means rewind and mirror mods so apparently this game has now become like Prince of Persia The Sands of Time where you can play like Super Mario Brothers and oh no I fucked up rewind that's pretty cool
Wait, Nestor?
It's like a remix.
Like Howard and Nestor?
Yes, and also like the NES emulator on the PSP.
Or every other platform out there.
Alright.
Did you not get that reference because we're old?
I got that.
No, because I subscribed to Nintendo Power when I was little.
I still have the first issue in a box somewhere.
It's all torn up.
I probably don't anymore.
But I remember the Castlevania issue.
And the issue 6, or the last issue of the Nintendo Fan Club.
I don't even know what that is.
No, that's before my time.
I know that.
Something else.
That's it, guys.
We're going to go now and call it a show.
So have a great night.
Until next week, go away.
We'll see you next time.
Thank you so much for supporting Independent Radio.
If you like the show, tell two friends about our show because that's how we get the word out because, of course, we don't – well, we're poor, so we can't exactly buy advertisements in magazines, so we rely on your word of mouth.
If you enjoyed what you heard or if you didn't enjoy what you hear, tell people how much we suck because we'll still get listeners that way.
and I'll make ourselves feel good.
So that's it.
And that's really, really it.
There's no outro tonight.
We lost all our music in the temporary studio, remember?
Orange Lounge, blah, blah, blah.
We're just going to end it right here.
Good night.
