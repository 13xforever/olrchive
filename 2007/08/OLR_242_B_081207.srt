00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,760
twice weekly.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,240

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,480
to websites with listings of past episodes.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,960
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,920
And welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 242, this part

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,520
B on August 12th, 2007.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,960
Of course, we do tape live on Sunday nights at www.orangeloungeradio.com, and we have

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,240
a chat room full of folks who are chatting about what we were talking about during the

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,700
bonus segment, which is for the live-only folks, where we're talking about possibly

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,080
creating a fighting game that would be like Capcom versus SNK, except it would be Orange

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,140
Lounge Radio versus All Games Interactive, and I think the results there would be hilarious.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,460
So we'll have to talk more about that, maybe make a thread in the forums and see if All

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,680
Games would want to get some of their talented artists and game designers in on it, too.

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,760
Just do it in one of those, like, create-your-own-fighting-game programs.

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
I think it would be hilarious.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,520
A lot of people would enjoy that.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,160
All right, and meanwhile, let's get back into the gaming news and talk about the real console

19
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,560
gaming news out there, and I believe Loki's going to start us off this segment.

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,960
Yes, apparently there's a rumor going around that Sony's going to acquire Rockstar Games,

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,000
and I guess this would be good for Sony, since, you know, they need more first-party games,

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,080
and definitely having the Grand Theft Auto franchise to themselves would be pretty good.

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,240
Although, I don't know, apparently various sources of the press and, I guess, development

24
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,080
team are saying that Sony is looking to take Rockstar under their wings, and I know that

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:44,360
they have, was it LA Nor coming out for the PlayStation 3 exclusively in the spring, so

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
I don't know.

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,160
They're saying also, I guess, there's going to be another exclusive game afterwards, but

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:56,000
I can't help but think there, you know, maybe some exclusive games for Sony, but I doubt

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
that they're actually going to be bought up by Sony, because, I mean, they're making money

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,200
hand over fist, so they'd be so stupid they cut out the Xbox 360.

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,400
Doesn't it seem like this story is somewhat like jumping to conclusions?

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,520
Like that's the feeling I got when I read it, is that, oh, well, Rockstar's been working

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,300
a lot with Sony, and now they're doing this exclusive thing for Sony, so therefore Sony's

34
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,640
going to be buying Rockstar.

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,180
I don't think, I mean, think about it, I mean, why would they say, I mean, I guess if they're

36
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,920
part of Sony, it doesn't matter that they're not selling as many units, but they're not

37
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,600
exactly suffering or struggling financially, I think, I mean, granted, you know, Grand

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,480
Theft Auto 4 being delayed is not helpful, or all the lawsuits, but shit, when that game

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,340
comes out, they're not going to be struggling financially, so, some healthy skepticism courtesy

40
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,660
of the chat room as well.

41
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,080
Frisbee says, not going to happen without a big fight.

42
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,320
Ross Steel UT says, Microsoft just paid them 50 million, it's not going to happen.

43
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Yeah.

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Perfect example.

45
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
There you go.

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,600
Well, one thing that can happen right now on your PSP is a brand new application called

47
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,640
PSPTube.

48
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,300
This is from a Japanese PSP homebrew developer, Sophia Cat, and basically what this does is

49
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,880
it will let you watch YouTube videos on your PSP.

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,480
Now, you don't have to convert the files or do whatever, you just basically play the videos

51
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,340
directly from YouTube.

52
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,560
Kind of cool there.

53
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,000
Of course, you do have to go through some hoops and stuff to make it happen.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,280
If you want to check it out, you can visit the Sophia Cat site there and look at more

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,800
information, but basically you have to make a developer ID and put it in this file and

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,560
then it's kind of a bunch of crap you have to do.

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,920
But they're going to, they also just released another new version of it that's supposed

58
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,280
to have a favorites folder and stuff like that, that you can download videos and stuff

59
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
from there.

60
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,480
So, unlike, you know, sure you could do this probably through the web browser as well,

61
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,900
but this is actually streaming videos straight off YouTube.

62
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,760
This isn't just viewing them off of a web page or anything, so I guess it's a little

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
bit better.

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,600
SSJ100Matt has a good thought here.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,080
How long until PSPOrnotube, or PSPUporn, or PSPXTube, I mean it's just a matter of

66
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
time, right?

67
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,080
I hope.

68
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,640
Because that's what people really want to do on their PSP.

69
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,720
And they get the XXXBox thing coming out.

70
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
Boo.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,240
I wanted another cookie, Rob.

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,560
The brand new bad joke mistress of Orange Launch Radio, Dark Soccer.

73
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
No, no, no.

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,740
I was emulating Junami.

75
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:40,240
I did buy that, I bought it in a 160 gig external hard drive, four videos on either the 360

76
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
or PS3.

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,040
All right, I will go get Jamie a cookie while she reads the next story.

78
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,760
There's one cookie left.

79
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,880
Well, for anybody who actually gives a crap about this game, and also since it's a UK

80
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:02,080
release that I'm referring to, it was slipped during a press conference that, well, Activision

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,800
UK is only confirming winter, however Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare has been given the

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:15,160
date of November 9th for Europe on PS3, PC, and XBox 360.

83
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,240
So you can have fun shooting down people if you want to.

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Enjoy.

85
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,840
And I think that's about the same time as the one in the US is coming out, so it's not

86
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,280
a huge surprise that they're releasing around that same time.

87
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,360
Obviously, extremely awesome game.

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:37,480
I mean, the video that they've been showing so far, very early, but very fucking awesome.

89
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,080
Such a kind of game.

90
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,720
I think so.

91
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,640
The other thing that's kind of interesting, there's a whole PlayStation starter pack that

92
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,680
was going on in the UK.

93
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,940
Apparently it was one where they were actually offering the 60 gig system with Resistance

94
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,120
and Motorstorm and two controllers for a set amount.

95
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,560
Now the problem is that there's conflicting sources saying that the starter pack might

96
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,040
actually be in jeopardy, that they might be done with it in August 31st.

97
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:16,920
So much like the limited price point drop for the 60 gig system, and that makes sense

98
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,320
if it has a 60 gig system in there, and if they're phasing out the 60 gig, then yeah,

99
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,920
of course it's going to be in jeopardy.

100
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,280
So if you want one, better buy it now.

101
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,440
Alright, well of course PAL is the international format, or the format overseas in the Europe

102
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,280
region for video games and for television signals, and speaking of things that have

103
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,220
been going on overseas as far as video games go, Manhunt 2 of course, lots and lots and

104
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,320
lots of stories hitting the internet when the British Board of Film Classification effectively

105
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,360
banned Manhunt 2.

106
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,800
Something to be considered this week is that Rockstar Games is currently appealing the

107
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,480
decision, and there was actually an associate at game specialist law firm Osborne Clark

108
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,600
said something about how it may be a while before this decision has the possibility to

109
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
be overturned.

110
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,480
Quote, last time this happened with Carmageddon, the appeal worked so that's a positive precedent.

111
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,360
Rockstar has taken a while to build its case, so they've obviously been taking stock of

112
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,720
what the BBFC have said.

113
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,320
They'll have to work together to agree on making the right cuts.

114
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:28,680
So it is possible that the BBFC could reconsider, but we won't find out for quite a long time.

115
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,140
Also something to think about is that quote, if the BBC feels that the violence running

116
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,320
throughout the game is too much, it's not like a film where you can just cut out certain

117
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,800
scenes as of course a lot of people said when the story first hit the internet, when the

118
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,880
game was first banned.

119
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
No I'm really disappointed.

120
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,480
I can understand why they would want to censor it and stuff so that it can be released on

121
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,080
all the consoles, but I really wish they would kind of open the console format so that you

122
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,600
can have, you know, what would be the equivalent of an NC-17 game, you know, where it's the

123
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,360
uncut version where you can kill the strippers, fuck them, and then kill them again.

124
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,200
You know, just something like that.

125
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I wish all this talk would just...

126
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,360
Can that be the other way around?

127
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,680
I just wish all this talk would go away and I wish they could just release the damn thing

128
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,980
with an adults only rating and that everybody didn't have a collective thumb up their butt

129
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,320
about how, you know, having adults only games on their platforms are going to corrupt children

130
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,920
across America, you know.

131
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,200
Sony needs to go and say, hey, we'll accept adult only games, go ahead and bring it out

132
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,360
on the Playstation 2 and PS3 exclusively.

133
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
There you go.

134
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,440
A little bit of an edge for them.

135
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,320
Alright, well, we shall see what happens.

136
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,360
I'm sure this won't be the last time you hear about Manhunt 2, like it or not.

137
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,960
Well, this is actually pretty cool.

138
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:57,560
A business called Omega Sector opened in Birmingham, of course, in Europe.

139
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Not the Birmingham in Alabama?

140
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
No.

141
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,560
But I've been there.

142
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
Okay.

143
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
I've been there lots of times.

144
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
It's not fun.

145
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,200
Sorry, people in Alabama.

146
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,880
But this is a place that has 400 custom built PCs.

147
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:18,640
It's 22,000 square feet, two floors, it has an internet cafe, movies, a room for Xbox

148
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:27,560
360 gaming, sponsored by Squeenix, THQ, Activision, and they've all got their own little places

149
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
to play at.

150
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:36,880
You can play Final Fantasy XI, Call of Duty, Shadow of Chernobyl, Stalker, and it's just

151
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,400
a big, massive gaming spot, and so it's open for business.

152
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,360
Someday when I become rich, I will open something like that and call it the Orange Lounge, but

153
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
that's pretty cool, though.

154
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,760
Well, there's two mobile Omega Sectors that will come and do parties and concerts and

155
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,760
things like that, but this is kind of cool.

156
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,160
You pay five pounds to get in, and then you can go around.

157
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,400
There's promo stuff everywhere.

158
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,320
You can basically not just go into play.

159
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,560
You've got stuff for actually interacting with people, so that's kind of cool.

160
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,140
We need one next door.

161
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,140
In the backyard.

162
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,840
Yes, in the backyard.

163
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,000
Now I do have that shed I'm not really using for anything else, so let's install one of

164
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
these in there.

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,400
Even though there's no air conditioning in there, we'd probably melt.

166
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:42,920
You know, there's some interesting news coming out about a violent game law in California

167
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,120
that would have restricted anyone from, under the age of 18, from buying or renting violent

168
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,440
video games.

169
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,640
I didn't even know that was in the works, which is interesting.

170
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
Well, I'm sure we talked about it previously on the show.

171
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I know we did.

172
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,600
Well, there's been so many states, you know, I just can't keep track of them.

173
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
True.

174
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:13,400
Anyways, so the bill signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger back in 2005, it's been overturned,

175
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,840
so that's interesting because of course it was unconstitutional, yada, yada, yada, pretty

176
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,040
much the same thing that every single state so far has found out.

177
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,760
You know, it was a while ago when this happened.

178
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,480
I think this was back when we were doing the to-go show, we were doing the separate shows,

179
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
when this first went through.

180
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,060
I think that's why you forgot about it, because I remember that guy, Leland Yee, they were

181
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,960
parading him amongst all the game blogs and some of the shows on TV and how he wrote this

182
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,360
bill and everything, and to his credit, even if we may not agree with his law personally,

183
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,040
he was at least willing to chat with the game sites and the blogs and stuff.

184
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,320
Yeah, and the thing and problem is it said violent video games, and of course, you know,

185
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
what is violent?

186
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,920
You know, that's the problem.

187
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,600
It wasn't like adult-only games or mature-rated games cannot be sold to these people.

188
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
That's right.

189
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,820
You know, if they had done something like that, then that would have been a little different.

190
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,820
I don't know.

191
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,360
I think it's stupid that they're having laws for that since they don't have laws for that

192
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,680
for movies or music or anything like that.

193
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,980
So what happens now?

194
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,980
Is it gone forever?

195
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
Is it going to go away?

196
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
No, of course not.

197
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,980
Never hear about it again?

198
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,520
Of course not, because you know, when it was been deemed unconstitutional, Governor Schwarzenegger

199
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,760
says, well, it will be back, you know, pun intended, of course.

200
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:33,460
And he says he isn't done protecting the bill's targeted youth.

201
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,360
Thank you, Schwarzenegger, for saving our kids with censorship.

202
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,400
Thank you very much.

203
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Especially since...

204
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,340
Yeah, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Schwarzenegger like, you know, not only star

205
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,640
in but give some money to the Terminator 3 project, which was an R-rated movie that I'm

206
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,620
sure many kids snuck into, I mean, hello?

207
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,160
Or Terminator 2, or Total Recall, I mean, the chick had three boobs, I mean, what kid

208
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,720
is not going to, you know, try to sneak into a movie like that?

209
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
I mean, come on.

210
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,240
Where a chick has three boobs?

211
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,240
Exactly.

212
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:10,060
All right, well, anyhow, you know, news of these laws not going away and just the fact

213
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,080
that here we go again makes us very angsty.

214
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,260
So of course you know what that means.

215
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,720
It's time to make our own violence here on the program with our segment called The F-You's

216
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
of the Week.

217
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:32,540
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

218
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:39,000
My F-You of the Week goes towards people who don't know when to shut up.

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,320
People who have to get the last word, who must always be right.

220
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:54,160
People who don't understand when it's better to let things lie than to prolong a bad situation.

221
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,320
F-You to that.

222
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,800
Loki, all right, my F-You goes to this chair that I'm sitting in because it's horribly

223
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,920
uncomfortable.

224
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,560
It's hard, the back of it's like super stiff, like I feel like my spine is being readjusted.

225
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,000
Not good.

226
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,400
And then also F-You to my computer for resetting.

227
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,640
I reinstalled Windows with Service Pack 2 now.

228
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,540
Not only is my internet slower thanks to that, but I did kind of try to fix that.

229
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,000
It's still resetting randomly.

230
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,200
I just think the motherboard's crapping out.

231
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,680
It's kind of old, so.

232
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,760
Need to build a new computer.

233
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,600
That's it.

234
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
My F-You of the Week goes to Comcast for reasons previously mentioned.

235
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,080
I mean, just the fact that they completely were fucking up our order made us wait so

236
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,460
long to get the freaking internet here, and then we were sitting around the whole day

237
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,720
and offered practically no compensation for it, so they suck big floppy donkey dick, so

238
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
that's it.

239
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,120
Wow, that was short F-Yous tonight.

240
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,360
I'm quite impressed.

241
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,920
Going from something F-You to something that makes me very, very happy is news on Spore.

242
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,900
Of course, I'm very excited about Spore, and a lot of us have thought, ah, Spore is pretty

243
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,560
much going away for a little while because the damn game's not supposed to come out till,

244
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,280
what, like 2009 now at this point?

245
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:23,240
Well, Spore didn't show up at E3, but Spore will be showing up at the Leipzig Convention

246
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,840
in Germany.

247
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,480
It's going to be actually playable behind closed doors.

248
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,240
Now, of course, I wonder if that means, okay, is it like last year's E3 where it's going

249
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,200
to be playable by somebody else, or will select lucky few people actually get to play it?

250
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,160
Supposedly Spore is still on track for a 2008 release, but I think most people would agree

251
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,080
they will release it when it's damn good and ready, and they're going to take their sweet

252
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,960
ass time to make sure it's right.

253
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
So let's hope so.

254
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,000
Let's hope it's right, but keep your eye on your favorite game blogs from August 23rd

255
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,880
to 26th when the Leipzig Games Convention's going on, because that's when you're likely

256
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,960
to see some news on this.

257
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,760
You see really what's happening, though, is the game is done.

258
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,400
Right now they're just working on emptying Scrooge McDuck's vault so they can stick all

259
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,840
the money in there that they're going to make on this game.

260
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
That's what they're doing.

261
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,920
Are they going to go swimming in it?

262
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,320
And they will go swimming in it.

263
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
What?

264
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,500
They're going to make tons of money off this thing.

265
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
That's what it is.

266
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,960
Stop fucking making playable demos.

267
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,960
I mean, that's all they're working on is goddamn playable demos for these stupid events.

268
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,760
Just finish the fucking game.

269
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,560
They're just trying to tease you.

270
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
Then you'll make the money to go in the vault.

271
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
They want you teased.

272
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,760
Then you'll be able to swim in it.

273
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,560
I just think it's very random that you brought up Scrooge McDuck's vault.

274
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,400
I think that that's appropriate.

275
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:47,900
By the way, dear Capcom, Capcom, yeah, where the fuck is DuckTales 3?

276
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,080
Why didn't we ever get that?

277
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,960
Maybe because DuckTales is off the air?

278
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Who cares?

279
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Who cares?

280
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
No, no, no, no.

281
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,320
It's all about the DuckTales moon level.

282
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
I know, for real.

283
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
The best music ever.

284
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,080
DuckTales, what kid that grew up in the 80s doesn't remember the DuckTales video game?

285
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,760
DuckTales 2, who cares that it didn't sell at all because it was released towards the

286
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,520
end of the NES lifespan.

287
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,440
Every kid upgraded to a Super Nintendo at that point.

288
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,920
So where is DuckTales 3?

289
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,480
Couldn't it be done on the DS?

290
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
What?

291
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,680
Did Capcom release the license or something?

292
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,800
It's not on the air anymore.

293
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,480
They're hanging out with Duke Nukem.

294
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,580
Who cares?

295
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,580
Look at Kingdom Hearts.

296
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,200
Scrooge McDuck's in Kingdom Hearts and so is Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

297
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,160
But that's also got a lot of the more modern.

298
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,480
The Tron is in Kingdom Hearts 2, which makes me happy.

299
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,960
But you remember, though, those characters were not only on DuckTales.

300
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,120
They actually existed in other cartoon shorts before DuckTales.

301
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,840
Okay, I don't really give a shit who makes the DuckTales game.

302
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,160
I just want one and I want it to not suck.

303
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Make it yourself.

304
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,280
They can maybe do a DuckTales level in Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a Darkwing Duck level.

305
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Yeah, Darkwing Duck.

306
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,560
Supposedly, Kingdom Hearts 3 is not Kingdom Hearts 3.

307
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,160
Okay, Kingdom Hearts 3.5.

308
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,400
Kingdom Hearts 2 is another game, you know?

309
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Like they do.

310
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
2-2 or something.

311
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,520
I don't know.

312
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
That's what Ross Tilly UT says.

313
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,440
Kingdom Hearts has shit from the 50s in it.

314
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,640
Even earlier than that, they have the Timeless River or whatever that level is called.

315
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
That level is awesome.

316
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
That's the Steamboat Willie level.

317
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,200
But you know, that's like classic Disney.

318
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,400
It's not like, they don't have a tailspin level.

319
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,200
Ballora's not wearing it.

320
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,560
That's because tailspin is rip-off of the Jungle Book.

321
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,800
You do get one Gummy Bears reference, which is pretty awesome, because you have the Gummy

322
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Ship, right?

323
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,880
Oh, that's not really the Gummy Bears, though.

324
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,520
But that's what I like to think in my own mind, is that it's a Gummy Bears reference.

325
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,720
The thing has absolutely nothing to do with Gummy Bears.

326
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Shut up!

327
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,400
But we've got our poo level, and I hate the poo levels because they're not all that fun.

328
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,040
Where's my level based on Swiss Family Robinson?

329
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,680
Where's the Herbie Love Bug level?

330
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,840
They need to have Bruce Campbell in that one, too, because Bruce Campbell is in a Herbie

331
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
movie.

332
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Or what was the dog?

333
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,040
Not Old Yeller, but the other one.

334
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,440
Shaggy the Dog or whatever it was?

335
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
A Shaggy Dog.

336
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
A Shaggy Dog.

337
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
That's it.

338
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,080
That darn cat below there.

339
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,800
What about the Witch Mountain movies?

340
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,200
All right.

341
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
I love those.

342
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Now we're getting random.

343
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,360
Let's please go to another story.

344
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Speaking of random, actually not really, there are new Wii Virtual Console stuff rated out

345
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
now.

346
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,880
Thank you, ESRB, you bastards.

347
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,840
Thank you, you bastards.

348
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,160
I love that.

349
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,320
Well, what games are they?

350
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
We have...

351
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,320
Faithful News Reporter.

352
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,160
Landstalker, The Treasures of King Knoll.

353
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,260
I never played that.

354
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,000
I've never even fucking heard of that game.

355
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,080
Shinobi 3, Return of the Ninja Master.

356
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
I'm sorry.

357
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,960
Shadow Dancer was better.

358
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,120
Shadow Dancer was the best Shinobi game ever.

359
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
And...

360
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
And...

361
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Ghoulsy Ghosts.

362
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,120
Yay!

363
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,920
Wow, they're really getting obscure on some of these Genesis and TurboGrafx titles that

364
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
are coming out.

365
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,280
And yet, we still don't have Guardian Legend, speaking of obscure.

366
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,680
Why don't you have Metal Gear on Virtual Console?

367
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Where are some of the other old Konami classics, besides just Grapple?

368
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,920
You know, there's a good point that they make here that just because it's rated doesn't

369
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,680
mean it's going to come out.

370
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,200
So, who knows, like, what the fuck, Landstalker, whatever.

371
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,320
You know, they should let me pick games for the Virtual Console, because I'd put Panorama

372
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,160
Cotton all up in there.

373
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,480
Rasteel UT makes fun of what Jamie said.

374
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,800
Thank you, you bastards.

375
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,600
Rasteel UT says, I'm very gracious, you retarded spastic fags.

376
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:53,880
You know, it's like, if I were to pick games for their Virtual Console, I would be just

377
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,380
like, well, how about we pick the one where you fix the fucking internet thing and make

378
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:04,200
it so it's actually, you know, games playable over, you know, Wi-Fi and shit like that.

379
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,840
Stop working on Virtual Console games and fix my goddamn Wii internet.

380
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,280
Hit an Excitebike and have the save mode work.

381
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Son of Dad has a damn good point.

382
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,920
Where the fuck is Michael Jackson's Moonwalker?

383
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Dude, I know!

384
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
That game was great.

385
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,400
I mean, besides all that, you know, child molestation he ran for other countries bullshit.

386
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
I mean, come on!

387
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
It was a great game.

388
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,600
You know what game that we need on Virtual Console?

389
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
The Goonies.

390
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Not the Goonies 2.

391
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,200
No, we need Goonies 2 as well.

392
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,400
Well, we need that eventually, but we need the first one that came out.

393
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I'm saying, where's all the Konami?

394
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
There was a first one?

395
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Yes, there was.

396
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
Yeah, there was, but only in Japan, I think.

397
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,600
And it had an arcade release that was one of those timed Nintendo crappy games that,

398
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,600
you know, they had the Super Mario Brothers one where all your enemies are beetle bugs.

399
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,080
All right, let's get past that quintessential games we want on Virtual Console stuff.

400
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,440
Get back into some news.

401
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,080
All right, well, it's very unfortunate that this super awesome game is only exclusive

402
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,000
at Walmart, but Chibi-Robo DS, people thought that it might have been scrapped at first,

403
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
but guess what?

404
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,320
Walmart's going to have the exclusive rights to this super awesome game.

405
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,040
No, really, it really, really sucks.

406
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,360
It is a horrible game, played at E3.

407
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,400
Well, the GameCube one was kind of shitty too.

408
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,800
Well, let me put it this way, the DS captures the essence of the GameCube game perfectly.

409
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,620
So yay, Chibi-Robo Park Patrol will launch October 2nd at Walmart, so you know what?

410
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,640
And Walmart is releasing it in a limited edition baby shit green case.

411
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Who knew?

412
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,480
Oh wait, that's not the case, that's actually baby shit.

413
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,440
Well, I don't know if you could get this at Walmart, but I certainly would like to be

414
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,200
able to get this.

415
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,760
DreamKitty.com is offering these very cute little overlays for your Nintendo DS.

416
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,800
They're Hello Kitty overlays, that's right.

417
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:57,160
You could take your pink DS light and make it pinker with new Hello Kitty overlays you

418
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,980
can get, and it looks like bling a little bit, like they have gemstones on it, but that's

419
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,280
a little pattern there, Hello Kitty thing on the front, and then little kitty designs.

420
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,200
Actually there's really not any kitties inside, it's all like flowers and gems and all sorts

421
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
of other girly shit.

422
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,640
I'm surprised they're not selling this at the Sanrio store.

423
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,520
$16.49 plus shipping if you would like to buy this at DreamKitty.com, and I know I want

424
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,560
it, so we'll see.

425
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,440
I'm seriously considering buying it, how cool would that be?

426
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,880
And as the article says, go for it, you'll sure be the envy of every ten year old girl

427
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
on the block.

428
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
I know.

429
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,080
Well hold on, when people come into the house and they see my Hello Kitty toaster and my

430
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,000
Hello Kitty coffee maker, it always gets a comment.

431
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh my god, you bought that?

432
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,920
No, mostly it's been, oh my gosh, my daughter would love that.

433
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,960
Alright, anyway.

434
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,560
Let's open up the mailbag and get a little serious here on Orange Lounge Radio, and open

435
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,520
up ye old mailbag and see what you guys, listeners, have to say.

436
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,360
Go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place you can always send those emails to, and Dark

437
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,000
Soccer is going to dive on in and pull out some of her favorite emails.

438
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,640
So here she goes.

439
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,600
The first of three emails that I'm going to read, it says, Hey, OLR guys, not sure if

440
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,960
this question has been covered before, but if it has, sorry about that, okay, we forgive

441
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
you.

442
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Next email.

443
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,200
Sites such as BimaniStyle.com and its message board cater to Bimani players mainly in the

444
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,920
U.S. with an English language.

445
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,760
GameFacts.com is another major site with a large message board that deals with all sorts

446
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,760
of video games.

447
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,920
It is another site with a user base predominantly from the U.S. that speaks English.

448
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:50,320
Using those two sites as an example and excluding 2chan from the answer, what is one Bimani

449
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,520
site from Japan and one major video game and general site from Japan that caters to players

450
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,780
from the Japanese region with a fully functional message board and a user base from the same

451
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,780
region?

452
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,680
I ask this because we don't hear much from these sites and they don't get much recognition

453
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,160
for being a major thriving site outside of Japan.

454
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,520
Thanks, Snaps.

455
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,800
Well first of all, I think that I'm the only person in this room that really reads much

456
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,480
Japanese and that's maybe 30 kanji if I'm lucky, so we typically don't go to those sites

457
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,960
given that we can't reliably read them and that Nifty Global Gate doesn't always translate

458
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
quite right.

459
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,120
Yeah, unfortunately I don't have a lot to give you there for the same reason, like I

460
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,960
don't speak Japanese so going to those sites doesn't do me a lot of good, but I can give

461
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
you this.

462
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
Erin in Japan.

463
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,680
There is a site, well actually outside of that I can give you one site that's all in

464
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,360
Japanese as far as the what is a good Bimani site with boards to look at and that would

465
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:54,680
be a website called Mia's Another Leaf and that site is m-i-e-y-a dot cool dot n-e dot

466
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,560
j-p and I first discovered this site because they actually have us linked on it and so

467
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,280
it came up in the referrer's log and so I checked out the site and they run a fully

468
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,560
functional news blog and I'm pretty extensive on the Bimani coverage there and of course

469
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,880
they have some DDR characters, Alice and Emmy in their logo, so you know they've been around

470
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,160
a long time.

471
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,600
The site brags that they've been up since 2001, March 6th of 2001 they've been running

472
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,680
so there you go, that's the site you can definitely check out.

473
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,880
Again that's Mia's Another Leaf.

474
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,280
As far as the more general gaming site, I don't know unfortunately I couldn't tell you.

475
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,080
Next time you send us an email tell us the site you want us to plug and we'll check it

476
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
out.

477
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,080
General gaming site, I would say probably Famitsu dot com.

478
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,560
Yeah there is Famitsu.

479
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,080
I'm sure they have forums that go along with it.

480
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,320
Alright next email then.

481
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:49,720
Next email dun dun dun is um, there's a sigh.

482
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,240
Hello all at Orange Lounge Radio.

483
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,360
You know what Jamie, I officially share your annoyance of children.

484
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,200
Their greedy, sticky fingered, badgering brats who have left in control of parents who don't

485
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,840
know what the hell they're doing can become Satan incarnate.

486
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Wow.

487
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,320
My cousin is a perfect example, complete lack of discipline for that kid.

488
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,560
Also I was at the arcade today for some good old fashioned DDR Max 2 and with my luck there

489
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,880
was a party with a bunch of munchkins running around.

490
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,880
While I played this little girl kept asking me for money.

491
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,160
Now come on.

492
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,320
I was told never to ask strangers for money when I was a kid and I never did.

493
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,120
But yeah her mother wasn't even around either.

494
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,000
Then another kid came up and started jumping on the arrows behind me while I was selecting

495
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
a song.

496
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,960
I went to move back onto the map and began to play the song and he almost runs into me.

497
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,320
Thank God his mother finally showed up or that kid would have lost a foot had I stepped

498
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
on it.

499
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,680
Ever had this experience at your local arcade with children?

500
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,680
Yeah it sucks.

501
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,320
Whatever you do Jamie, just don't reproduce.

502
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,840
You and your husband will live happy lives.

503
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
Sincerely Osifer.

504
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
P.S.

505
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,720
I'm not sure if I spelled your name correctly, feel free to connect me.

506
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,800
And Rob, spaz your anger.

507
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,440
You spelled my name correctly by the way.

508
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Thank you.

509
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,520
Well Osifer we'd all like to thank you for the email here at Orange Lounge Radio.

510
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,440
And so would all the screaming children.

511
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
I don't know.

512
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,080
I mean you know kids are kids.

513
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,520
I think kids when being parented actively aren't so bad.

514
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,000
But unfortunately at a lot of these types of places like the arcade and Chuck E. Cheese

515
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,760
these are places where the parents go to get a break.

516
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,860
And they just let their kids run around like crazy.

517
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,040
You did it too when you were a kid.

518
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
So I didn't.

519
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
Really?

520
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,800
I never ran around like crazy.

521
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Never ever?

522
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
In just my backyard.

523
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,000
Not in public.

524
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,280
I had an all-girl bicycle gang.

525
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,720
Wait you were a member of a bike gang?

526
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,880
No it was four of us and we would ride the streets like we were on patrol.

527
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,240
Only I had like the best bike of everybody so nobody could keep up with me.

528
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,440
I'm fascinated by the fact that you were in a bike gang when you were a little girl.

529
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,960
That's amazing.

530
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,680
But I wasn't a problem child like that.

531
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,200
Because keep in mind if you grow up in the south your parents don't give a shit about

532
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,040
all this PC bullshit.

533
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,840
They're just going to discipline you.

534
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,140
You have all that stuff that Bill Engvall said about going out to the tree and picking

535
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,520
your own switch.

536
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,480
I did that.

537
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,760
That is cruel and unusual punishment.

538
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,560
Wowzers.

539
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,520
Yeah I had a birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese.

540
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,740
We all ran around like crazy while our parents sat around and gossiped.

541
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
That's how it worked.

542
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,240
I think there's a difference between actually going to an arcade and going to a place where

543
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,200
you're expected to be overrun by a bajillion children.

544
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,160
At least with an arcade you expect to have people monitoring their children.

545
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,000
Well look at what's happening in arcades.

546
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,400
They're all turning into birthday palaces.

547
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:49,480
Well at my arcade when I worked at one we would ask, we would not let any child under

548
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,640
a particular age be without an adult accompanying them.

549
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,720
Even if it was the adult with their little group we wouldn't let them just run amuck.

550
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
No small children.

551
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,720
Wow.

552
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,880
But you know, I like Namco.

553
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,480
So shall I go on?

554
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,760
You shall.

555
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
Maybe I won't.

556
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
I will.

557
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
This is from Misty.

558
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Aww.

559
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,760
Hi Misty.

560
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,480
I thought closing on Sundays.

561
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,840
I can't be the only one able to close this night, no.

562
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,480
I can't be the only one able to close this night of the week.

563
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
I miss you guys.

564
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Heart Misty.

565
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Aww.

566
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,960
That was a sharp but sweet email.

567
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Well I miss you too.

568
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,400
Is that it?

569
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
That's it.

570
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
We need more emails.

571
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,040
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you would like to send us some emails.

572
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,440
Give us some more stuff to read next week.

573
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,280
Well before I forget I did want to say that there's no pump up the volume this week either.

574
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,980
Last week there was a funeral.

575
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,440
This week I have a class.

576
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,440
So no pump.

577
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
Sorry.

578
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
Alright.

579
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
We will have some weeknight shows.

580
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,120
Slowly returning probably after the summer.

581
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,480
I know Travis is finally back on Saturdays and I want to say that DMN said he's doing

582
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,380
his thing on Thursdays and whatever so there's lots of stuff coming up as far as the weeknight

583
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,360
shows go and then Wednesday night should be back pretty soon as well after all this summer

584
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,480
craziness has ended.

585
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,720
So let's get back into some game news.

586
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Loki keep us up.

587
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
Summer craziness.

588
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Anyways.

589
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,440
Now so I was going to say there's some interesting things.

590
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,400
Not a huge surprise with the day and age that we're living in but airport security is beginning

591
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,840
to inspect game consoles and you know don't worry they're not going to break them open

592
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,720
to make sure that's the game console but they will x-ray them for you and they probably

593
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,280
will I don't think they're going to forbid you from bringing them on the plane but just

594
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,300
so you know it will be x-rayed.

595
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,520
I mean is anyone surprised?

596
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,240
I bring DS's on the plane and you just have to put them on the x-ray belt like anything

597
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
else so.

598
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
Exactly.

599
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,440
It doesn't seem like anything new to me but I guess maybe the big fat consoles they're

600
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,940
doing now like if you put them in your luggage maybe they're like my wife and go why are

601
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:07,760
you bringing that around it's not a portable console what the fuck because you're a hardcore

602
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,000
nerd I don't know yes well one thing you could bring around with you if you own an iPhone

603
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,520
is NES games that's right there's new NES emulator for the iPhone and it doesn't run

604
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,880
so great but it's kind of cool that it's actually in production it actually produces a little

605
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,000
tiny Nintendo style controller on the bottom of your iPhone screen and then you play the

606
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,080
game in the main iPhone display it's pretty I guess simple to get up and running but unfortunately

607
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,600
it's slow there's no sound the controls are not that great for right now but hey it's

608
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,640
a start and it shows that it can be done now the first thing you got to do is of course

609
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,400
you have to you know kind of hack your iPhone because you know the way you get some of the

610
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:58,880
other stuff on there but it's possible it's very possible anything is possible of course

611
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,520
I don't have an iPhone so I couldn't tell you I got to see melody's iPhone oh yeah how's

612
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,720
she liking that she likes it okay I actually thought it was going to be fairly prohibitive

613
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,760
you know and in the service plan but apparently if you're already like I'm with singular right

614
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,060
now apparently if you're already with them then it's actually just an upgrade to your

615
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:22,400
plan and not like their whole new expensive you know gouge you in the you know eyeball

616
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,480
price well that's cool I heard stories about someone being charged three thousand dollars

617
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,880
for browsing the internet on their iPhone oh my lord no um they have like some unlimited

618
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,000
servicing but I don't know I still don't want one I want you know a phone that I can text

619
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,960
with that's it yeah the iPhone's a bit much for me I mean I own a phone that doesn't shut

620
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,940
off every you know randomly I understand why people are all getting into it but it's just

621
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:52,960
not for me just not for me you know I have a laptop I'm happy with it anyway there is

622
00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:00,360
a little bit of information coming out of the South Park camp for anyone who is picking

623
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:08,200
up the season 10 DVD bundle you get a 14-day trial of World of Warcraft which is kind of

624
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,600
funny because season 10 had the Warcraft episode in it huh yeah but also Blizzard helped them

625
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:19,280
with it which I thought was funny wow but what I don't know I finally saw the episode

626
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:28,600
it was funny I would think that most people man bathroom I would think that most I would

627
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,880
think that most people who watch South Park have probably already given World of Warcraft

628
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,680
to try once in their life at least I just thought that I haven't you know you know who

629
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,080
I finally got to play World of Warcraft this week by the way I heard you're finally back

630
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,600
like I saw your post in the forums well yeah if anyone would actually add my noob character

631
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,800
to the guild and tell me what you're gonna be on tell me when you're gonna be on next

632
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,920
and I'll I'll send you money and get you in the guild okay and you know who you can play

633
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:00,360
with now who's also a noob William the boyfriend is on he started playing World of Warcraft

634
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,180
because he was such a Starcraft fan like he still plays Starcraft now it's like the one

635
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,880
game he really does play and is really into and you know we kind of said well if you like

636
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,480
that game why aren't you playing like World of Warcraft or some of the other blizzard

637
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,680
titles so he tried it out and he loved it so now he sucked into it World of Warcraft

638
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:22,300
when there's absolutely nothing else to do so I play about once a month but when I play

639
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,940
I play for a while yeah stay far away while you still can because once you get sucked

640
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,980
in it's it's it's bad I won't get sucked in well even when I played Final Fantasy 11

641
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:37,080
I didn't get sucked in that's because you hated it but I was really good with a controller

642
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,800
hey I could do all that macro crap with a controller that's cool hey you should have

643
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,560
been playing on 360 you saw you saw me do that too I know and I remember commenting

644
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,960
like wow how do you do all that shit with a controller of course the game was designed

645
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,520
for the PlayStation 2 so it's supposed to be played with a controller but I I would

646
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,280
never be able to do it I I actually had a hard time figure out the macros on my function

647
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,640
key so I just like screw it I use my controller and then I got so pissed off I couldn't play

648
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:10,200
World of Warcraft with the controller I was like damn it all right anyway yes this only

649
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:20,680
could come from Second Life but apparently there is a virtual sex program called I guess

650
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,940
made by a company called Eros LLC and it makes realistic genitalia and creates sexual moves

651
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:34,800
for Second Life citizens and apparently this one guy who created it found out that his

652
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,560
works have been resold by someone else who has been claiming that he made it but so now

653
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:55,680
he is going to be suing them actually it's interesting the whole sex in Second Life but

654
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,880
somebody should sue everybody involved for bringing sex to Second Life I mean really

655
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,200
because that's all some people think about and where the hell is that three feel game

656
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,320
that we saw e3 two years ago hello random three feel was great it was funny because

657
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,760
they're no no no no don't do that they had to get their translator because I wasn't supposed

658
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,320
to click the button SSJ 100 matt says because we can make girly count SSJ 100 man our charm

659
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:30,400
says because people can't get First Life sex that's fine I guess well on to a little bit

660
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,080
more serious note and something not often talked about would be the good side of gaming

661
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,200
you know we hear about all these laws and all these you know sex-crazed pervs ruining

662
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,520
games well there's some good news about the good of gaming that's going on and it's actually

663
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:51,600
thanks to Wii Sports the Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute at Minneapolis's Abbott Northwestern

664
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:57,480
Hospital actually aids patients who suffered from strokes by letting them play Wii Sports

665
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:03,660
that's right it's kind of a little bit of their rehab program kind of interesting coordination

666
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,320
there's actually an article that was ran in a local paper called the Star Tribune that

667
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,920
talks about the we have a program and even has a picture of a guy they're playing Wii

668
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:19,240
Sports so kind of cool there and let's see you a quote here from one of the patients

669
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,320
quote I'm not a video game player this is the only one I've ever played because of the

670
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,140
interaction of the game I get the physical sensation of playing tennis it really works

671
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:34,840
it can fool me into thinking that I'm doing what's happening on the screen kind of cool

672
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:40,520
so that's cool that's why we play games to so we won't get strokes I mean I don't I play

673
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:47,400
games because they're fun I don't well but it's both simulation games anyway well I'm

674
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,840
glad to see the games being used for good and reporting on you know some of the good

675
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:57,100
stuff about games so there you go of course I don't know I if these patients are like

676
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:03,040
me they're gonna get bored of Wii Sports in a day or so but maybe I'm just jaded I think

677
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:10,040
it's more fun if you've got people there with you true at any rate though for those who

678
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,500
were are into simulations speaking of that type of thing well not really it's rock band

679
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:28,400
I mean hey a price point is released of $199 and if you have an Xbox 360 guess what no

680
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:38,240
wireless screwed who cares wireless is kind of overrated wires are long wires can be extended

681
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,760
wrap up the wires stop being so lazy it's wireless really that big a deal maybe I guess

682
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,720
I don't think so especially if you've got the drum hooked up with the wires and a microphone

683
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,400
hooked up with the wires and you're gonna have a tripping hazard all right I'll give

684
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,240
you that the only issue that this game is going to have with that is not everyone's

685
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,400
going to have a USB port hub and what you're going to try to play for players you like

686
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:10,440
were the other USB port so you know that's the only issue that this will have but the

687
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,600
reason why I think they're not doing wireless is because you know to license the wireless

688
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:21,320
you know technology patent or whatever from Microsoft Microsoft just give them a buy on

689
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,800
it for this it caught well look at guitar hero I mean their guitars are ten dollars

690
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:34,440
more for the wireless so I don't know not a big deal though but it is pretty cool if

691
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,520
you don't want to get the $199 bundle though with it you can actually buy the game by itself

692
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,740
and then all the guitars and stuff will be sold separately at a certain retailers out

693
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,400
there because you can use a guitar here controller on it right yeah I think so so if I already

694
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,520
have guitar hero two then I'm pretty much and I'm not really interested in the drums

695
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,920
honestly I just want to play online with friends and I can use a guitar and I'll do the vocals

696
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,620
oh I'm getting the set same I know it's stupid because I hate guitar hero you won't play

697
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,320
it past a day I give it a day that you're gonna play it and that's it I'm getting I'm

698
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:14,680
of course gonna get the set now you might give it two days no we still play guitar hero

699
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,360
at my house you you damn time you and Dan will have fun with that because Dan likes

700
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,280
to play guitar right he brings his buddies over yeah and of course that's when I go hide

701
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,960
because you know they all get extra manly around each other well that's the thing I

702
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,320
just I won't buy the game because I'll just go over to Loki's house to play it or your

703
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,260
house come to my house well if all we still need to play Super Metroid Rob oh we sure

704
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:39,360
do let's do that um soon Wednesday no yeah Wednesday maybe Wednesday I don't think though

705
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,080
the show will be back this week we'll do it live on air yeah that'll be the Wednesday

706
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,640
show from Metroid Rob and Jamie play Super Metroid on air that actually might be kind

707
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,560
of a fun show we should actually make that like a regular show like Rob and Jamie play

708
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:57,960
something on air and today we have the Atari 5200 we're playing kicks but because it's

709
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,760
the Atari 5200 none of the controllers work yeah we could run it through the camera thing

710
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,640
I'll have to show you later like we put a camera on the TV and do it that way let's

711
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:13,200
do that I think we can show OMG OMG all right anyhow sorry we're gonna open up the Skype

712
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,000
line very soon but we got one more story for you guys before we do that and of course when

713
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,240
the Skype line is open you can give us a call to talk to us our username on Skype is orange

714
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:28,280
lounge radio or you can actually call us on the real phone 1-877-GAME-OLR anyway so Circuit

715
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:35,120
City isn't too happy with CheapAssGamer because of course as you'll remember one of their

716
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:44,760
forum posters by the name of Speedy1961 had leaked the ads from Circuit City to the website

717
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:51,320
and of course that revealed the price drop information for the Playstation 3 and none

718
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:57,560
were too happy about that so they've actually subpoenaed CheapAssGamer to try to find out

719
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:05,800
who the real identity of Speedy1961 is but of course CheapAssGamer is going to be fighting

720
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:12,400
this because they want to protect the rights of their posters so it should be interesting

721
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:21,880
RasteelUT says looks like an employee is going to get his ass fired I don't know if it's

722
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:25,800
an employee of any one of those because I think they also had Best Buy and other types

723
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,480
of ads leaked as well Rob D says we got to fight for our right to

724
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:38,760
ad scan well I mean what do you guys think do you think they have the right to be putting

725
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,960
out the subpoena out there or do you think maybe if they wanted to protect the information

726
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,520
they shouldn't have kind of leaked it in the first place both I think well I don't know

727
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,660
if they have I mean granted it's you know stuff that's not supposed to be out there

728
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,800
so they have the right to protect that but at the same time you know they should be more

729
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,880
careful with you know information getting leaked maybe have more of these people signing

730
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,880
you know non-disclosure agreements and stuff like that I don't know if there's any if they

731
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,880
are smart there should be some sort of policy you know regarding this if it is an employee

732
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,600
that's you know doing that and they should be able to take proper action based on that

733
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,240
policy if they don't have a policy in place for that then well you know you kind of setting

734
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,760
yourself up for trouble all right well you guys can call right now and give us your opinion

She'll wear them around the house.

00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,340
Let me end on one thing and say I hate them.

766
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,340
I've seen entire angels. Wish she was dancing in her Underoos.

No, I don't know you probably some of the other stuff you mentioned though is certainly a possibility clocks, watches,

Oh Bandit says Halo underwear for those who need extra man cannon support. There you go.

771
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,980
Let me end with this note. I hate the MacBook Pro. Thank you.

772
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,980
Alright, you're welcome. Have a good one buddy. Thanks for calling.

773
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,980
YouTube. Bye.

774
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,980
Alright, let's go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.

775
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:06,980
Again, if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

776
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:13,980
And unfortunately only one call can come through at a time or everything kind of gets screwed up here.

777
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,980
So we're going to another call.

778
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,980
Man, I can't handle this. This Skype needs to be changed.

779
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,980
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

780
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,980
Um...

781
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,980
Hello?

782
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,980
Yeah.

783
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,980
Hi, hello. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

784
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:35,980
Nah, it's Legend of Zaku. Just seeing, you know, since I was trying to get through it and everything.

785
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,980
That's alright. What's on your mind buddy?

786
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:41,980
Uh, nothing. Just trying to struggle through disappointments over the weekend.

787
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,980
In particular, Supernova 2, which has been crapping out in Jersey Gardens.

788
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:50,980
I've heard that there's another location test for DDR Supernova 2. What's the deal?

789
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:56,980
It was the same place where they had the second Supernova location.

790
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,980
You know, they had another Supernova location test last year.

791
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:08,980
Anyways, what I've been able to gather from all the folks around my area that actually went to the location test on Thursday.

792
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:20,980
There were brand new Paranoias discovered. In particular, Paranoia Hades. Just started shaping up to become a really good 9-footer.

793
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:26,980
I'm trying to dig up the information right now. We have crossovers in the form of Bloody Tears.

794
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:32,980
You know, that Castlevania song from Distorted actually now making its appearance in DDR.

795
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:42,980
I'm trying to see what else. I know it was a whole bunch of videos, but I'll post it right now in the chat.

796
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:50,980
Wait, so you actually got to play the test. You went out to Jersey to play the test. Hello?

797
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:58,980
Not really. Because, you know, it was working up until Thursday and then Friday was just crapping out ever since.

798
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,980
Saturday it managed to get up, but then it started crashing after just scrolling through songs.

799
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,980
When I showed up today, it was still back to Supernova.

800
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:11,980
I see. A band that says if you just type Supernova 2 into YouTube, you can get a bunch of stuff.

801
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:16,980
It is a test machine, Zaku. It's not going to work perfectly, right?

802
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:22,980
Right. I assume they had a bad upgrade kit for all intents and purposes.

803
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,980
They're probably going to straighten those issues out. It could be hardware related.

804
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:34,980
Let me try to keep this constructive. Zaku, what would be the one thing you would want to see Konami do with Supernova 2?

805
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,980
Well, I know they probably won't be able to do this. Memory card slots, which is damn near impossible at this point.

806
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:48,980
EMUs would be nice. Just follow through on it. Make it offline in addition to online versions.

807
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:58,980
Just so they could get more arcades to adopt it for those that don't have the money or don't have the means of actually getting an internet connection.

808
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,980
All right. Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Zaku?

809
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:10,980
That's pretty much it. Hopefully, if that thing gets back up, try to get some more info.

810
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:25,980
But as far as it goes, there are brand new 10-footers showing up, especially from the videos. Especially in the only course boss rush.

811
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,980
So it certainly gives something to keep people busy, huh?

812
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:37,980
So far, it's been positive. We're just trying to get through the issues that are holding the test room happier further.

813
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:42,980
All right. Well, Zaku, we're going to let you go so we can take more calls. Thank you very much for your call. We appreciate it.

814
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:49,980
How's it going? Again, if you want to call us, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

815
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,980
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

816
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,980
GS68.

817
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,980
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?

818
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,980
Finally got to play Maximum Tune 3.

819
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,980
Oh, what'd you think?

820
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:08,980
Pretty awesome. Especially like the new Ghost Battle mode where you raise someone's ghost and then after that your ghost gets created.

821
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,980
And then after that the machine creates a ghost of your driving.

822
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:17,980
Now, out of curiosity, did you play this on the PlayStation or did you play this on the arcade?

823
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,980
I'm talking about the arcade one.

824
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:25,980
I think the PlayStation 3 one is based off an older game or something. But you played the PlayStation 3 one. What'd you think?

825
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,980
I didn't get it, but again, I can't read Japanese, but I didn't get any sense of what the hell was going on.

826
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:36,980
I mean, obviously there was racing, but I had no idea what the hell was going on. I mean, that's the downside about importing Japanese games.

827
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,980
You don't speak the language. I mean, duh, you're not going to understand the game.

828
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:48,980
The one thing I noticed, I thought the music in the thing I was listening to sucked. I didn't think the music was that great.

829
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,980
You mean the one in Maximum Tune 3?

830
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,980
Yeah, how is the music in Maximum Tune 3 GS68 in the arcades?

831
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,980
That's some pretty good stuff.

832
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:04,980
Does it sound like Yuzo Koshiro did it again? Is it the same stuff from Maximum Tune 2?

833
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,980
Yeah, I've already got a few favorites.

834
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,980
Oh, cool. Well, then that's a good sign. I don't know what the hell's wrong with the PlayStation 1 then.

835
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:15,980
Maybe you just haven't played far enough into it or we're just not understanding what the hell we're doing. I don't know.

836
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,980
But it didn't look like that much fun.

837
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,980
I'm thinking about reselling on eBay.

838
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:25,980
We'll see. Well, certainly I will check out the arcade one if they get in an arcade near us. Maybe I'll change my mind.

839
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,980
Or hopefully the PlayStation 1 will come out here eventually. So we'll see.

840
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:35,980
Is it really popular? I mean, are there long lines to play it? Because the racing games seem to still draw crowds at the arcades.

841
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:43,980
Well, I've played it both at Cityville Golf and Mepitas Golf, and there's about four or five people waiting on each machine.

842
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,980
Wow. For this day and age, that's still a long wait. That's a popular game.

843
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:53,980
Anything else you want to share with our listeners? GS68.

844
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,980
No.

845
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:59,980
I will definitely check out Maximum Tune 3 when I get a chance and let you know. Like the arcade version.

846
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,980
I'm not going to base it off a Japanese game I can't understand.

847
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,980
All right.

848
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,980
All right. Take care, buddy.

849
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,980
You too.

850
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:06,980
All right. Bye-bye.

851
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:14,980
All right. We've got enough time for about one more call here. If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our user name on Skype is Orangelaunchradio.

852
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,980
But we have another call. Let's go to it.

853
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:21,980
Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio. Who's this?

854
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,980
Hi, you are on Orangelaunchradio. Is somebody there? Can you hear me? Hello?

855
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,980
It's a celebrity. It's Airman.

856
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,980
Hello, this is Chris Alp, where you can pre-order Madden OA and Halo 3. How can I help you?

857
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,980
Hi. Oh, there you are.

858
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:38,980
Hi, GameStop, where we can pre-order. I want to pre-order Halo 6. Will you take that for me?

859
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,980
No, it's actually the Rob D. How's it going, guys?

860
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,980
Oh, good. How about you, Rob D?

861
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:57,980
Not too shabby. I was actually curious. With this Halo Mountain Dew, which I actually did go out and purchase during the break, by the way, because someone described it as a cross between Code Red and regular Mountain Dew, and I love Code Red, but that's a different story altogether.

862
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:58,980
Is it good?

863
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:07,980
I actually like it. It's kind of like a Pepsi or Mountain Dew version of, I guess, Sprite, Tropical Remix, if you remember that from a few years ago.

864
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,980
Yeah, where the hell are you all getting this at? Like 7-Eleven?

865
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,980
What was that? I got it from the local market, actually.

866
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,980
Oh, huh. I'll have to look for it while I'm out next.

867
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:20,980
Wait, am I really going to buy a drink just because there's some remote game thing in it? You know what, no.

868
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,980
I won't buy it because it's not sugar-free.

869
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,980
I'm not going to buy it. Fuck this drink. I don't care what it tastes like.

870
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,980
Hey, you bought the blue Pepsi, okay? Come on, you'll buy anything.

871
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,980
That's true. That Pepsi Blue was some nasty, nasty shit.

872
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,980
But, Rob, we remember Crystal Pepsi.

873
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,980
Oh, Crystal Pepsi was lovely. All right, anyway, sorry, Rob D., your thoughts?

874
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:43,980
But I was curious, what licensing agreement between games and some other product would you like to see?

875
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:53,980
I mean, I think that Nintendo's missing a huge thing with not doing, say, a Mario pasta thing, like, hey, it's a Mario Mastachioli.

876
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,980
You know, I thought that they had a Mario pasta at one time. I swear to God.

877
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,980
Didn't they have the Nintendo Breakfast Entertainment System?

878
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:01,980
No, bring back the cereal.

879
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,980
They did have Mario pasta. I remember they had that because there was, like, a little Yoshi shape.

880
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,980
It was like Nintendo mac and cheese or something.

881
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:17,980
And to tell Dark Tetsuya Hello Kitty 2DX, it was the Hello Kitty Dreamcast and the Hello Kitty PlayStation 2.

882
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,980
Gosh, what video game tie-ins would you like to see?

883
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:26,980
I want to see Burger Time 2 with the Foreman Grill.

884
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,980
How about, like, Night Trap 90s? Digital Pictures would still be around if that existed.

885
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,980
You could have, like, PS2 FMV games. Oh.

886
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,980
Night Trap 90s? What?

887
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,980
Yeah, but Dana Plato's not with us anymore to model them.

888
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,980
I do like the Halo 3 Underoos. That's pretty awesome.

889
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,980
From the grave.

890
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:46,980
Exactly.

891
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:48,980
That's all kinds of weird.

892
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:51,980
They're all about the necrophilia tonight.

893
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,980
This is random.

894
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,980
Let's see. I'm opening up to the chat room to see what the chat room thinks.

895
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:02,980
Son of Dad says, Nintendo Wii Sports Bowling Shoes.

896
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:08,980
GS68 says, Halo Racing Game with Warthogs, Ghosts, and Pontiac Grand Amps.

897
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,980
A reference to something in the last game.

898
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,980
We need your mom, the game.

899
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:15,980
Jvmon says, Mario Spaghetti from Chef Boyardee.

900
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,980
How about Chef Mario?

901
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,980
Give me that.

902
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,980
I don't know.

903
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,980
Yeah, I'm drawing a blank.

904
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,980
I'll have to think about that one. Maybe that's a future list list in our future. I don't know.

905
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:33,980
There you go.

906
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:34,980
I have one more question for you guys.

907
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,980
Of course. What's up? One more thing.

908
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,980
Nah, not going there.

909
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:44,980
Have you guys heard the news about how 3D Realms supposedly wants to port Duke Nukem 3D over to Xbox Live Arcade?

910
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,980
Stop ruining my last minute stories, dammit!

911
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,980
The callers are ruining your last minute stories tonight.

912
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,980
No, that's great. Yes, I did read that story, even if Loki was going to read it later.

913
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,980
This is totally good radio, but I was going to show you. See, they did have it at one time.

914
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,980
Here's a commercial for Super Mario Bros. Craft and Macaroni and Cheese.

915
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,980
I want that.

916
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,980
How come my mom didn't buy me that when I was a kid?

917
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:18,980
I actually remember that because they had tips for Super Mario Land 2 on the back.

918
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,980
That's how I found out about the space world.

919
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,980
You know what I fucking hate, though, is the macaroni and cheese that's made out of the powder.

920
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,980
That shit is so nasty.

921
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,980
The bunny ones are good.

922
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:33,980
I like that if I'm going to make mac and cheese, I have to use that more creamy cheese sauce because the powder is nasty.

923
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,980
Anyway, sorry. That was horrible radio.

924
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,980
And I even forgot what your second question was.

925
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,980
I didn't actually get to it yet. I was wondering if you had read the story.

926
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,980
I was wondering what other old PC games would you like to see ported to Xbox Live Arcade?

927
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:52,980
I've been clamoring for X-Wing for a long time. I would love multiplayer X-Wing on Xbox Live Arcade.

928
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,980
But is there anything else?

929
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:59,980
Okay, we've got Loom. Put Loom on the list. We got it. Check. Understood. Yes, ma'am.

930
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,980
Loom was great.

931
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,980
Really?

932
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,980
Loom, mac and cheese.

933
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:12,980
No, I went and bought a copy of Loom like a year ago on eBay just because I wanted it badly and I can't play it.

934
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:17,980
There's your branding. A Loom branded Loom. Wouldn't that be wonderful?

935
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,980
What's this made out of, Rob?

936
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,980
I don't know. Glass.

937
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:24,980
Let's see. The ferret's in a box where it belongs.

938
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,980
No!

939
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,980
What other old, besides Civilization, just because that's my favorite PC game of all time.

940
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,980
Descent. Completely redone.

941
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,980
Descent. That would be kind of cool.

942
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,980
Like, I'm trying to think of games that would make good multiplayer games.

943
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,980
Descent.

944
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,980
I remember that from my younger days.

945
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,980
Modem Wars. Redneck Rampage.

946
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,980
Yeah!

947
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,980
Carmageddon.

948
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:50,980
I went Jess Jackrabbit or Commander Keen. Anyone else play those?

949
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:51,980
What? Commander Keen?

950
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,980
Commander Keen, yeah.

951
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,980
Or Jess Jackrabbit?

952
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,980
I think Jess Jackrabbit.

953
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,980
Was Jill of the Jungle? Hell yeah.

954
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,980
Or ZZT while we're at it, although I don't think that would really work.

955
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:01,980
ZZT.

956
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:02,980
That wouldn't work on Xbox 360, I don't think.

957
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:03,980
We need Gemstone!

958
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:04,980
ZZT for the win.

959
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,980
How's that for your MMO?

960
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:08,980
You actually played ZZT? It's been years since I played that game.

961
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,980
We need, like, the old text-based MMOs.

962
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,980
Yes, I went Zork on Xbox Live Arcade.

963
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:20,980
You saw the page that's a 404 error that's Zork, right?

964
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,980
Yeah, I've seen that. That's great.

965
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,980
Enter room. You can't enter room.

966
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:29,980
Did you ever play the Crimson Room game?

967
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:30,980
Mm-mm.

968
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,980
It was, um, it's a Flash game.

969
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,980
They need those type of games on Xbox Live Arcade.

970
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,980
How about Oregon Trail on Xbox Live Arcade?

971
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,980
There's number munchers for that.

972
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,980
That'd be pretty rad.

973
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,980
We were talking about Oregon Trail, Rob.

974
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,980
At, um, at Pina Gogo. Not Pina Gogo, that's the old one.

975
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:48,980
At California Extreme.

976
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,980
Yeah?

977
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,980
It was me and Julie and Dan and Mel and Melody at the Ben and Jerry's.

978
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,980
Talking about Oregon Trail and all those.

979
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,980
And, um, we were talking about our favorite old games.

980
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,980
Reliving Diphtheria over and over again.

981
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,980
I was like, dude, Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?

982
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:07,980
There you go. There's another great Xbox Live potential. I don't know.

983
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,980
Where in Time, specifically.

984
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,980
Now we're just naming random shit.

985
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,980
No, I'm not. I'm serious. I want that game again.

986
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,980
I was good at it, too.

987
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:18,980
Well, Rob D., let me ask you. Oh, thank you.

988
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,980
Shadow Charlie in chat says Heretic. Yes, we need that game.

989
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,980
Monkeys Island. No, we just need Hexen.

990
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,980
Rob D., what would you want?

991
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,980
X-Wing and X-Wing Commander Keen and, well, actually, just X-Wing and Jazz Jack

992
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,980
would be the two that I could think of.

993
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,980
Just because those had multiplayer in there already

994
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,980
that would translate perfectly to Xbox Live or Cade.

995
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:37,980
How about One Must Fall?

996
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,980
Phantasmagoria.

997
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:40,980
Can you do?

998
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,980
No, seriously, Phantasmagoria.

999
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,980
Phantasmagoria was huge. It was like seven CDs, wasn't it?

1000
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,980
It could fit.

1001
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:48,980
It's old now.

1002
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:53,980
Well, Rob D., thank you for the conversation about good PC gaming retro goodness.

1003
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,980
We've got to let you go and wrap up the show.

1004
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:56,980
No problem. See you guys later.

1005
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,980
All right, take care, buddy. Bye-bye.

1006
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,980
All right, well, that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.

1007
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,980
Thanks so much to those that called in

1008
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,980
and sorry to those that didn't get through,

1009
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,980
but if we took any more calls, then Loki's last-minute stories might get spoiled.

1010
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:11,980
So, Loki, if you have any last-minute stories, please, now's the time.

1011
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,980
Anyways, let's see.

1012
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:18,980
Duke Nuke with 3D is waiting for the Microsoft's Xbox Live arcade go-ahead,

1013
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,980
so I'm going to remove that.

1014
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:26,980
Okay, and BioShock on the marketplace. Bye-bye.

1015
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,980
Let's see here. Oh, yeah.

1016
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:36,980
There is apparently a TIFF exploit now in the PlayStation 3 firmware, 1.81,

1017
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:43,980
and they've gotten apparently a backup of a PlayStation 1 game to run on it.

1018
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,980
Yay.

1019
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:45,980
What game?

1020
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:46,980
I don't know.

1021
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,980
And then also a Hello World little demo thing.

1022
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,980
Sorry, it was Crash Bandicoot Crash Party.

1023
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:57,980
Therefore, this thing has no usefulness whatsoever

1024
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:58,980
because nobody wants to play that fucking game.

1025
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:59,980
It was Pandemonium.

1026
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:00,980
Pandemonium.

1027
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,980
It was Devil Ties. Enjoy.

1028
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:08,980
And then I'm going to say this heavily erring on the rumor aspect,

1029
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:12,980
but apparently some random GameStop employee said,

1030
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:19,980
Hey, there's going to be an Xbox 360 Ultimate with an HDMI port and HD DVD drive

1031
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,980
because if he's saying it, oh, it's got to be true.

1032
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:22,980
It must be true.

1033
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,980
Why is that even being reported on the site anywhere?

1034
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,980
Because this one website likes to report complete rumor stories like that.

1035
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,980
Then again, we ran the Sega list, but only because somebody submitted it.

1036
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:34,980
And because I wanted it to be true.

1037
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:39,980
Yeah, we just wanted it to be true.

1038
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:43,980
All right, anyhow, I have one other last minute story here

1039
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,980
coming out of Anderson, South Carolina.

1040
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:48,980
Thanks, TigerClaw, for sending me the link because I think this is all kinds of funny.

1041
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,980
This actually happened at a Toys R Us.

1042
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:53,980
There was a 13-year-old PlayStation hater at the store.

1043
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,980
Unfortunately, we don't know his name because of those laws that protect children.

1044
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:00,980
But what he did, he used a permanent black marker to write,

1045
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:07,980
PS3 sucks on 23 plastic security cases used to protect Sony PlayStation games from being stolen.

1046
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,980
Of course, the Toys R Us employees caught him.

1047
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,980
He was held until police arrived.

1048
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:16,980
His parents were not able to be reached, so he was taken to child services.

1049
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,980
When he was asked why he did it by the police, he said, quote,

1050
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,980
I have an Xbox and I hate PlayStation.

1051
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:28,980
I found the marker lying on the shelf and I guess I was bored. Sorry.

1052
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,980
That's fantastic.

1053
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:31,980
I guess I was bored.

1054
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:34,980
I find it even better they couldn't find the stupid parents.

1055
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,980
He was completely unsupervised.

1056
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,980
Well, they were off doing crack, of course.

1057
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:39,980
And poorly raised.

1058
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,980
They were off, you know, doing crack.

1059
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:45,980
They should be spayed and neutered.

1060
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:48,980
Remember, spay and neuter your humans.

1061
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:52,980
Did you check the Olive Garden?

1062
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,980
All right.

1063
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,980
That's it.

1064
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:58,980
Do you have anything, Loki?

1065
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:04,980
No, but I wanted to see some of the stuff for Supernova 2.

1066
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:08,980
I guess I'll have to get the PlayStation 2 game.

1067
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,980
Key word is get.

1068
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:14,980
DJ Kipples and Bits says, I guess he didn't have enough games to play on his 360.

1069
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,980
Damn the summer game drought.

1070
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:20,980
No, no, you're heaven mistaken with the PlayStation 3.

1071
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:21,980
Or the Wii.

1072
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:22,980
Christ.

1073
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:23,980
Well, there's plenty of games on the Wii.

1074
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,980
It's just none of them are any good.

1075
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:28,980
By the way, and I don't know how this story did not make tonight's show roll,

1076
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:31,980
but I swear to God I saw a story on it somewhere.

1077
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,980
Dark Soccer, they have officially announced they're making a Cooking Mama 2.

1078
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:36,980
Squeeze.

1079
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:37,980
Oh, that's right, because I didn't care.

1080
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:41,980
That's why I wasn't on the show roll, because I was like, oh, Cooking Mama 2.

1081
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:42,980
Don't care.

1082
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,980
I still need to borrow yours, Rob, on the Wii.

1083
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:46,980
I ain't playing it.

1084
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:49,980
Yeah, Cooking Mama 2 in early 2008.

1085
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,980
505 Games has entered into agreement with Cooking Mama Limited

1086
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:58,980
to deliver Cooking Mama 2 for the DS and the Wii across Europe in early 2008.

1087
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,980
So I imagine it's just a matter of time.

1088
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:04,980
I want it to be like a story-based game where, like,

1089
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:07,980
you know, Cooking Mama's relative accidentally murders somebody

1090
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:12,980
and they have to dispose of the body in, you know, creative culinary ways.

1091
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,980
I think that would be pretty cool.

1092
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:17,980
Mama will fix it.

1093
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,980
You know, Cooking Mama, I don't know.

1094
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:23,980
Cooking Mama Massacre.

1095
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:24,980
Mafia.

1096
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:25,980
Cooking Mama Vice City.

1097
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,980
Cooking Mama Mafia Story.

1098
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:31,980
No, it's Murdering Mama.

1099
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:32,980
Mama Fix Everything.

1100
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:34,980
Cooking Mama Soylent Green.

1101
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:37,980
It's people.

1102
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:38,980
No.

1103
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:39,980
All right.

1104
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,980
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought

1105
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,980
because we're about to wrap up the show.

1106
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:44,980
So final thoughts.

1107
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:45,980
Loki, your final thought.

1108
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:50,980
My final thought is game publishers are coming out in a few weeks

1109
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,980
and that makes me happy.

1110
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:56,980
And my final thought is I still hate macaroni and cheese

1111
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:57,980
with the powdered cheese.

1112
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:58,980
I love the powdered cheese.

1113
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,980
Cheese should not be in powder form.

1114
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,980
That's disgusting.

1115
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:07,980
Dark Soccer, your final thought.

1116
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,980
That was it?

1117
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:10,980
Freaking cookies.

1118
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:11,980
Cookies are great.

1119
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:12,980
You know, I have more cookie dough.

1120
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:13,980
I should make more cookies.

1121
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:14,980
Let's just eat the cookie dough, Rob.

1122
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:15,980
No, that's disgusting.

1123
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:16,980
No, it's not.

1124
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:17,980
It's great.

1125
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:18,980
You can get sick because of the raw eggs.

1126
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:19,980
You know what?

1127
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:20,980
What?

1128
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,980
That's really an old wives' tale

1129
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,980
because I used to work at a cookie place

1130
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:28,980
and I used to take home the cookie dough.

1131
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:33,980
Just because you didn't get sick does not mean you can't get sick.

1132
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:34,980
I know.

1133
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:36,980
I have special not getting sick from cookie dough powder.

1134
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:40,980
Special butter and sugar mix that protects you from the salmonella.

1135
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,980
It lines your stomach.

1136
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:45,980
Leave it to me to be the first person to die from eating cookie dough.

1137
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:46,980
All right.

1138
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,980
We're going to wrap it up, you guys, and call it a week.

1139
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,980
