With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, August 19th, 2007, the Wii and the 360 are the same price in one country,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Guitar Hero 3 gets a little poisoned, and is a Wiimote coming to the Playstation 2?

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-host, Dark Sakura.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hi.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How are you doing, Miss Jamie Summers?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm here.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You're here? You're alive and well?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, quite.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
All is good in the hood?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And not hungover.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, I got to watch Dark Sakura get drunk last night.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll drink everybody.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And no hangover?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No hangover.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Amazing.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Do you remember what you drank? Can you run down real quick?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, I can. I had a shot of cold sake. I had 28 ounces of Kirin beer.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I had six martinis, two of them being pom-tinis, one key lime pie, and Adam and Eve, because it was very tasty, it was apple.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I had a guavatini. I had, what was that? Oh, God, I can't remember the first one. The chocolate martini.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And then I had a shot of Glenlivet scotch.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And then I had some of that amaretto sour and tried a bunch of everybody else's drinks.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So a lot. A lot.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, yeah. I know that's exactly what I had.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now, just a note to the kiddies out there. Jamie didn't drive.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No, I passed out in the back of the car.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She's over the age of 21. I drove. I didn't really drink anything. So if you're going to drink, you have to drink responsibly.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Lecture, lecture, lecture.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And drink a lot of water when you do.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's right. All right. Also joining us, say hello to Loki.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hello.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Who did not join us last night.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, I did not.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
All right. That's all right. You weren't invited because it was a bachelorette party, so straight men don't get to go to bachelorette parties, unfortunately.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Rob went to mine.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But he's a straight man.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, exactly.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I know. I was saying you went to mine. I invited you.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I was like, by the way, my boyfriend got very, very drunk last night, and yeah, Jamie definitely out drank him.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm like next to nothing.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Out drank him. Anyway, nobody cares. They want to hear the video game chat.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Loki, what did you do last night? Maybe it was something gaming related.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Uh, no. Instead, I went and saw the movie Superbad, and it was awesome.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Was it good? I don't know.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I loved it.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I haven't seen, like, I think I saw, like, three-fourths of the 40-year-old virgin. I just never finished it, and then I didn't see that knocked up.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I wouldn't even compare it to it. It's not even anything like that. It's more like American Pie, but less retarded.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you've ever seen Knocked Up...

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You should put that on the poster. It's American Pie, but less retarded.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, if you've seen Knocked Up, it kind of has that same vibe to it. I mean, there's a lot of, you know, crude jokes and stuff like that,

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
but it's still very, you know, you don't go into it like, there's no real gross-out moments or anything like that.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's just kind of, you can relate to it, I guess.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is like freshman year type American Pie?

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No, this is like, this is like, it's almost, the premise is almost like American Pie. They're trying to get laid.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You know, this is the last party that they're going to be able to go to before, you know, they're in college,

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and they're just trying to basically get alcohol for this party and stuff and hook up with these two girls,

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
because, I don't know, they, I guess they want to be...

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Men.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Well-versed by the time they get to college.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That don't happen.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It was a good movie, and there's a lot of funny stuff in there.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So it wasn't like a gross-out comedy?

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, it wasn't a gross-out comedy, and they didn't really have any gross stuff in there.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Like, I didn't think that scene where the guy screwed a pie was that funny.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It was stupid.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's stupid. No one does that. Nobody does that.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
All right, well, let's go to the chat.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Our always present fourth guest is our chat room chat.orangelauntrady.com.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Lots of talk.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Jaded says, no, we don't want to hear the video game chat.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We want to hear the drunken people chat.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, I don't know. Some of our podcast subscribers might disagree with you,

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
so we will get to game chat very soon.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But, you know, I mean, you can read about the news pretty much anywhere on the internet,

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
but we like to put our personal touch on things and hear from you guys.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's why we always invite you guys to chat.orangelauntrady.com.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
RossdielUT says, crude jokes does not equal good comedy.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And Sephiroth1215 says, super bad was okay. I was laughing the whole time.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There you go.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And especially, you know, there's a whole...

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't want to ruin it, but there's a part where you find out that one of the characters had a really bad habit

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
in, like, when he was growing up, and it had to do with doodling things,

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and that part, it's super funny when they show it, and then after the credits,

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
there's more of that stuff, and it's hilarious.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Now, okay, so to bring things back to video games and we transition to how was your gaming week,

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
could there be a super bad video game?

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Because, you know, as movies do very good, sometimes they get turned into video games.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
There's not. There's a Napoleon Dynamite game coming out.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I was just thinking, I was like, speaking of things that jump the shark,

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm really surprised there's not a Napoleon Dynamite game.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There is.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Really?

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's DS and PSP, and it looks stupid. Horrible.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sweet.

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's like, I mean, it's not even coming out remotely.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's not like an anniversary of that movie or anything like that.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's just, oh, by the way, we decided, you know, let's make a movie for this,

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
or a game for this that's, you know, years after the movie.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, if there's one thing.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Gosh.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If there's one thing I really hate, it is video games based on shitty movies that shouldn't be turned into video games.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
They should do Xanadu the game.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now, that might be okay, actually.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But it has to be all animated by Don Bluth.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Because sometimes when movies are so bad, they're kind of good.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Like Showgirls the game, I'd buy that.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There's a Betty Boop game coming out in fucking October.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's like, come on! Seriously, you missed the boat a long time ago with that.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Aren't we past the 1930s high?

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's like no one watches Betty Boop anymore.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Tell that to Timeless River.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh.

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Alright.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But that was Disney.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Alright, let's get into a little bit of how was your gaming week.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It was Final Fantasy-ish.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Because I played Final Fantasy Advance 6 in your car a little, to show it to you.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I played at the gym.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I beat the first area, the first town, in the gym.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Which means you have like 49 more hours to go.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Shit.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But it's not Pokemans.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No, I love Final Fantasy 6.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I mean, obviously, many people will tell you.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You know, most people would say the best Final Fantasy game ever was either 7 or 6.

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Two. Japanese 2 or English 2?

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Japanese 2 or 5.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Really?

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I like the job systems.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, I'll give you that.

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't know.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I still have a soft spot for 4.

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But I think that's just because that was my first one.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You spoon-y bard.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes, and you spoon-y bard.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But anyway.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But, but, but, but, but, but.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I touched it today.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What?

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Final Fantasy 6?

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What?

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Super Metroid.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I picked up my Super Nintendo today and was going to pack it up and bring it over here.

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And then Dan informs me,

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, we're lending that to Adam.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank God you got it on the second guess, because the third guess wasn't much better

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
for me.

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
For the record, I do own Kirby's Avalanche.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So there.

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Alright.

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And Super, I was just saying, Super Metroid comes out on Virtual Console next week, but

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
you were like,

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No!

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That was exactly the noise you made when I said it was coming out on Virtual Console.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You were like,

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No, we're playing the real one.

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Even though the emulation on Wii is pretty good.

165
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We're playing the real one.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We're going to play the real one.

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Jamie and I failed.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Either that or I have to see if my Hori pad will work.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We failed to have our Super Metroid night, but we are going to have it soon.

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We've said we're going to have it very soon.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Well, they have those pads you can get that are actually converted.

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
They're modded real pads that you can plug into, like the classic controller to the Wii,

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
so you can play these games on the actual pads.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can just bring my Super Nintendo and play the actual game on the actual system.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
For the people who don't have a Super Nintendo.

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Go to your local flea market and pay $5.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm just going to chat and reading some stuff here.

178
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Son of Dad is talking about movie based games.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Remember the Nacho Libre game?

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes, unfortunately I do.

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thankfully I don't.

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't think I played that.

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That was on the DS.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What other crap is coming out?

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Arctic Tale, which for those who may not know,

186
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Arctic Tale is going to be a brand new movie, kind of like March of the Penguins,

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
except with polar bears and seals.

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Or what was the other one they had?

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Happy Feet.

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Happy Feet sucked.

191
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The movie was okay, but the game sucked.

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But at least Happy Feet was not a documentary, though.

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There was singing and dancing in there,

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
so you can kind of turn that into a pretty good game, I guess.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Tiger Claw says, Sky, what about the Alvin and the Chipmunks games?

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's going to be kind of like Guitar Hero.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah, but Alvin and the Chipmunks, so that's another movie tie-in game.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's going to be crap.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Here's the thing.

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The new Alvin and the Chipmunks makes me want to throw up in my mouth.

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
When I saw the poster, it looks like crap.

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And I just never liked the original to begin with, to be honest.

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's not one thing from my childhood I fondly remember.

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Dude, Jason Lee.

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I think they were kind of stupid.

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Jason Lee is such a sellout now.

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I mean, seriously, what the fuck happened since the View Askew days?

208
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I liked My Name is Earl.

209
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay, I don't like that show, but credit to that at least.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's a little different, but come on.

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I mean, seriously, Alvin and Chipmunks shit?

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I mean, now we're getting back into movie podcasting.

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's get back to the games.

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Was there anything else you wanted to share?

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
My Name is Earl is a TV show.

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And the only reason I saw that is because you were there.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
They were watching it at my Fourth of July party.

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The only game that I think this year that's going to be any good

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that's tied in with sort of a movie,

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and it's not even really based on a movie, the Simpsons game,

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
is going to be fucking awesome.

222
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That is it.

223
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That is the only game I'm buying this year that's tied in with a movie.

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, wait, except for the Harry Potter game, which I bought that for Nellie, though.

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
By the way, do you have to point out what we're discussing in the chatroom right now

226
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
as the benefits of emulation?

227
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Because I just said emulation for the lose.

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You know, because I prefer playing the actual game on the actual.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's just how I've always been.

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But there is a good point to emulation.

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Translated Japanese RPGs.

232
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Seiken Densetsu 3.

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The quintessential translated game you must play.

234
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Where they went and translated the graphics in the game.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Or Final Fantasy V before Square brought it over here.

236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That was the other biggie.

237
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I had a very, very well translated.

238
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Or even I had a translated panorama cotton once.

239
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That is not very good.

240
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The other good thing I think about emulation is that

241
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
for most of us that don't have the big bucks to spend on the real thing,

242
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
it kind of lets you play the old classic games that time forgot.

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Now we have Virtual Console and Game Tap.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, which is cool.

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And I support both of those, as you know if you listen to the show.

246
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And the Ninja Pass.

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
For any length of my time.

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Anything else you want to share for your gaming week?

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No.

250
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I tried to play as much as possible.

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I played Casarone a little bit.

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The demo for that.

254
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And it's pretty interesting actually.

255
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I could kind of get into it.

256
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Because I know Nelly's been hooked on Catan.

257
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And I had to literally drag the 360 to a different room.

258
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So that I could actually play some games on it.

259
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So that was pretty cool.

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And then of course the one demo everyone's been playing this week

261
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
would be Bioshock.

262
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And I tried that and it's awesome.

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So awesome that I decided to pre-order my game after I played it.

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And then, see here, also played some more Beautiful Katamari.

265
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
All three minutes of it.

266
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And then, let's see, I played Overlord some more.

267
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And that's actually been pretty fun.

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I was pretty surprised.

269
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I thought I'd get tired of the game pretty quick.

270
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And kind of hesitated to purchase it originally.

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But I'm actually very satisfied with the game.

272
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's pretty fun.

273
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And it's really the game itself.

274
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You try to be good in it.

275
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And I think it's harder to be good in the game than evil.

276
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But after a while, the NPCs just really piss you off.

277
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And you just go and decide to kill everybody.

278
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And that's the way you should do it, I think.

279
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Other than that, I played me and my Katamari on the PSP.

280
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And tried to remind myself why I hated it on the PSP in the first place.

281
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And that would be the controls.

282
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They suck balls without having a second analog stick on there.

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And then, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

284
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Because for some reason, we're glutton for punishment with that game.

285
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't know how this is fucking possible.

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But the game actually glitches in new ways.

287
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It just progressively evolves into a worse game.

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And I don't know why.

289
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's just weird.

290
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's like a guy's own conscience or something.

291
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It just fucking gets worse.

292
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And I don't know how.

293
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But it does.

294
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And yet, we'll still play it until they release another fucking Grand Theft Auto game that has multiplayer.

295
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I think that's all I played.

296
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, I played track and field. Hated.

297
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Do you like it?

298
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Nah, think carefully.

299
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
For me, it's dumb fun.

300
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I mean, it's totally a brainless type of game, track and field.

301
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I still haven't bought the full retail one, but I've played the old school one on the computer.

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I know it was in the arcade at one time.

303
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, it was.

304
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I remember playing an arcade one long time ago.

305
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But they should remake it into the arcade with a DDR pad type thing.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I think that would be a little bit more...

307
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Like sports bars or something.

308
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Konami has both.

309
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah.

310
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
My Gaming Week.

311
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Not a lot of new stuff to try out this week.

312
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Obviously, there's Madden, but sports games are typically not my cup of tea, so I passed on that.

313
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So, just kind of playing the old stuff.

314
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
World of Warcraft.

315
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Boom Boom Rocket.

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Oh yeah, I played that too.

317
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What?

318
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Boom Boom Rocket?

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, World of Warcraft.

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
How'd that go for you?

321
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You were here.

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

323
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Dur.

324
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Anyway, let's see.

325
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What else did I play?

326
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Echo the Dolphin I downloaded and tried out on Xbox Live.

327
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And I have to admit, I thought the game was overrated when I first played it many years ago.

328
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I think it's overrated now.

329
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm not a fan of the Echo series.

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I never understood why people love that so much.

331
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You're breaking my heart.

332
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They need Calibri.

333
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I didn't like Calibri either.

335
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I played Hexic 2 just to see if the sequel was any better than the first one, because

336
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I didn't really care for the first one too much.

337
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The first one's kind of fun.

338
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I found the second one to be easier, actually.

339
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It was weird.

340
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Really?

341
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's a good thing, because the first one is really hard.

342
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, I was able to create a lot of, I don't remember what they are, but basically create

343
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
some sort of ring thing and it turns into something else.

344
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, you can tell you play a lot of that game.

345
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't like that it's not free, though.

346
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's the only thing.

347
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
There's actually something I do need to mention that someone reminded me in the chat room.

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
We did have an instance of the M-word in my house as I left.

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What?

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Madden?

351
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The M-word.

352
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh my gosh.

353
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Fucking annoying.

354
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
All right.

355
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We need a real football game.

356
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay, it's not the game that annoys you, I get the feeling, but it's your husband and

357
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
all his friends coming over and playing, though, that annoys you.

358
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Guess what?

359
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Later on, think-U-E-A, they decided, guess what, we're going to make two football games

360
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
a year, so now they're going to have NFL Tour, which is coming out in January.

361
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Can I finish my game of the week?

362
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Sorry.

363
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Can I finish my game of the week?

364
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That was the sound of the microphone being rammed into my head repeatedly.

365
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Let's see.

366
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Now, Dark Soccer, your heart is going to break a little more based on chat comments here.

367
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Gold Banjo says, Echo the Dolphin isn't even worth an emulation download.

368
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah, your mom.

369
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Sephiroth1215 says, I didn't like Echo, but I really like the Tides of Time.

370
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Tides of Time was great.

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
RawsteelUT says, Echo would be good if it weren't harder than real-life nuclear warfare.

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It wasn't that hard.

373
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Hey, you know what that game really needs instead of being Echo the Dolphin?

374
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
They made a knockoff game, I think it's actually by the same people that created Echo, called

375
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Laser Dolphin.

376
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It was basically-

377
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Cool!

378
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It was Echo the Dolphin with a laser on its freaking head.

379
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What the hell was that on Xbox Live?

380
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's on PC, but they had like, you know, turtles with rockets on them and stuff.

381
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It was basically all the sea creatures with different artillery on them.

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I mean, that's the only thing I can think that make that game any better.

383
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Alright, so I instead played demos.

384
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And here's the thing, like, BioShock, okay?

385
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Like, I was not getting excited about BioShock at all.

386
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm just like, oh hooray, it's another first-person shooter, looks all sci-fi, doesn't really

387
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
look like a game I want to get into.

388
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
In fact, I even went and I posted on my Twitter, and I said, because I have a lot of gaming

389
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
people that I know on Twitter, other independent podcast people, among other things, and I

390
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
actually made a post on Twitter that said something about like, so what's the big deal,

391
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
oh here it is, so what's so awesome about BioShock?

392
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm not knocking it, I'm just curious because usually I don't get too excited for first-person

393
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
shooters.

394
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And then gamer Andy replied to me and said, frankly, it's the immersive environment jam-packed

395
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
with atmosphere and the story.

396
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Irrational makes good games.

397
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And then I'm reading all these reviews, like what, it has like a 99, a Metacritic?

398
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm like, okay, I've got to see what's so frickin' fabulous about this game, right?

399
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So I downloaded the demo, oh my god, it really is that good.

400
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Like, if the demo is any sign of what the game is going to be, shit, that was a great

401
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
game.

402
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That was amazing.

403
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,500
And here's something, okay, that I thought was very interesting, and I observed this

404
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,000
when I was playing, I also observed it when my friend was playing.

405
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,500
When you first, you know, you start off, you know, you crash land your plane and stuff

406
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,500
and the water effects, and you get out of the water, I literally turned around, looked

407
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,240
at the fire in the water, and I stood there and like stared at it for like 30 seconds.

408
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,500
My other friend had played it too, he's just like looking at it, I was like, damn, that

409
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,200
looks really good.

410
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,300
The graphics in this game are hands down like, you know, and I really don't like reviewing

411
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,000
a game based on the demo, so let me say that up front, but I think especially in this day

412
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,400
and age, you can use a demo as a pretty good sign of what's to come for the game.

413
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,600
And I don't think I've seen a better looking game, period.

414
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,160
I mean, the game looks like phenomenal, it's amazing, and it was scary.

415
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,600
I don't know though if I'll end up actually buying the full retail version just because

416
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,340
I'm so horrible at first person shooters.

417
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,840
I'm so bad at them.

418
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,200
I am too, but you know what?

419
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,240
I wouldn't be able to play it.

420
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,240
I purchased it.

421
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,920
I had to get the limited edition so I can get a little, you know, the big daddy for

422
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,020
my desk at work.

423
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,120
But I love the fact that, you know, you could like get fire hands and like set people on

424
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,280
fire, that was so gratifying, I loved it, so.

425
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,880
Bioshock really is that good, like even if you're not a fan of first person shooters,

426
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
try out the demo.

427
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
It was scary.

428
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
It was Silent Hill scary to me too.

429
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,120
Well remember, now two favorite parts for me in the demo.

430
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,800
The one was the chick with the baby stroller, when you walked up to her and she's all talking

431
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,920
about how she turned her baby and stuff into a little sister, and then there was another

432
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,680
one where it was the couple, that kind of reminded me of like a cruise ship, older couple

433
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,360
or something like that.

434
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,960
I mean when you kill the guy whose name is Harold or whatever, the crazy wife comes after

435
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
you with a gun.

436
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,680
It was just kind of cool, that whole immersion.

437
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,000
So the game looks, I mean, usually there's a part of me that wants to go, oh it can't

438
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,160
be that good.

439
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
It can't be that good.

440
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,440
Why is everybody praising this game?

441
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,960
It really, like you really have to try it, like seriously.

442
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:41,200
Anyway, going to chat room here, DarVoid says Bioshock demo is fun, Chainsaw Juggling says

443
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,320
it's the best game ever, I can't wait till Tuesday.

444
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,120
Sounds like they're going to have a hit on their hands there.

445
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:54,000
Joshi16 says damn, I want my Bioshock, interesting.

446
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,480
That was pretty much my gaming week.

447
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:03,480
One other demo I did try and played a little bit was Beautiful Katamari, which to me, it's

448
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,360
the same fucking game, same fucking game, I don't care, with half the same fucking music,

449
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,600
might I add, in pretty HD graphics.

450
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,680
And you're right, the sad thing is I think there's a part of me that doesn't care either,

451
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,320
I'll probably end up buying the damn game, despite all the drama that happened on this

452
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,900
program because of that game, I don't know, it is still somewhat addicting and I'm looking

453
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,440
forward to multiplayer, but I still kind of look at it with shifty eyes going, did you

454
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,680
have to reuse the same freaking song on the title screen?

455
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,060
And kind of the same gag over and over, I don't know, I'd like to see something a little

456
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,440
bit different, but I'm hoping some of the new modes will make me feel a little bit better

457
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
about things.

458
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
So, that was that.

459
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,760
Otherwise it was a three minute demo, can't really tell a lot off of that.

460
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,600
Darvoid says it better not be 60 bucks, Katamari.

461
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,040
No, it's like I think 30 or 40, it's like cheap.

462
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
That's good.

463
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,340
Nintendo Maniac 64 says, so Sky, is Bioshock the ochre enough time of first person shooters?

464
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:04,360
I don't, again, I don't want to base my entire opinion of a game off a demo, but it damn

465
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,040
well could be based off of the earlier reviews.

466
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,760
Oh great, time wasn't that great of a game anyways, and I still don't know what everyone's,

467
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,300
I still don't know what the hell everyone's big deal is with that game.

468
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,040
In the Zelda universe, the Super Nintendo, Link to the Past will always be the best one

469
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
to me.

470
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Oh yeah.

471
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
Always be the best one.

472
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Definitely.

473
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Always.

474
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Always, Jamie, always.

475
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,740
You sound like a maxi pet commercial, Rob.

476
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
I hate you.

477
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,560
All right, housekeeping, let's do some housekeeping tonight.

478
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,200
Okay, the only housekeeping we really have tonight is going to affect the live listeners.

479
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,240
We just found out literally five minutes before we went live tonight.

480
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,760
We found out five minutes before we went live, live 365 is shutting down at 8 p.m. tonight,

481
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,040
so that's going to screw some of you live listeners out of some of the perks of listening

482
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,680
live and we apologize, like the bonus segment we do in between and the afterbirth just because

483
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
of the maintenance.

484
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,400
We're going to try and cram all the show in before 8 p.m.

485
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,720
We're going to rearrange Skypline a little bit too and do it in the beginning of part

486
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,440
B tonight and not at the end of part B as we usually do, and we're going to cut out

487
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,640
a few segments as well, like the mailbag, just because we got one email this whole week,

488
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,560
so we're going to roll it over to next week.

489
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,800
Mailbag at orangehonorsradio.com, we'd love to hear from you, your comments on the story.

490
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,440
Do you think Bioshock is all that?

491
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,480
I want to hear from people that played the Bioshock demo and didn't like it.

492
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,520
Please speak up because I always love to hear devil's advocate perspectives, so mailbag

493
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
at orangehonorsradio.com.

494
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,800
In the language of the week, I want email in as Italian, even though I can't read Italian

495
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
for shit.

496
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,540
Just be quiet.

497
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,280
I can still read French.

498
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Alright, so sorry you guys about the downtime tonight, there's nothing we can really do

499
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
about it.

500
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,100
We're going to try and finish the show before 8 p.m., but we'll see.

501
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:45,800
And I wanted to mention, though, podcast awards, they're over, you know, we got nominated,

502
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,760
didn't win, but that's okay.

503
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,440
Congratulations to a cheap-ass gamer cast.

504
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,640
Didn't we announce that last week?

505
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
I don't remember.

506
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,960
No, it wasn't over last week.

507
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
No, it wasn't over last week.

508
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,040
Well, thank you for remembering.

509
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,640
So congratulations to them.

510
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,920
At least it was another independent podcast award.

511
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Absolutely.

512
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,120
And we've always said, if we can't win it ourselves, it's best another independent podcast

513
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,700
win it, and another one did.

514
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,700
So there you go.

515
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,700
Good job.

516
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,920
And they've had a lot of, like, success this year, too, and a lot of drama with the whole,

517
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
like, what, that lawsuit?

518
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,720
Or, no, no, I went on a lawsuit, a subpoena.

519
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,840
The subpoena against them and everything?

520
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,480
Try to get the Circuit City ad?

521
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Foreign members.

522
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,400
It's been a fun year to be a CAG cast listener.

523
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Yeah.

524
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,760
So, good job for those guys.

525
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,240
You know, they're actually up for two awards.

526
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,960
I'd like to see them win the other one they were nominated for, but they don't find out

527
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,840
about the other one until the actual award ceremony.

528
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,280
Well, if any of them are listening, let me just tell you this much.

529
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,560
And I think I can speak for Jamie on this.

530
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,000
The award show is kind of lame.

531
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yes it is.

532
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
It could have gotten better.

533
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,400
They do have good nibbly food.

534
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,640
And I was about, I would have to say, by a distance of a foot and a half, I level with

535
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,000
Adam Curry's butt.

536
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm not joking.

537
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,600
And I couldn't really appreciate it properly because he doesn't really have a nice butt

538
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
and I had the flu.

539
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,160
Alright, please can we get into game chat now, because I do not want to turn this into

540
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,320
the Adam Curry's butt podcast.

541
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,760
But I will turn it into the Bioshock podcast because I'll be damned if the internet isn't

542
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,240
abuzz about the game this week, so I got a quick story on Bioshock.

543
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,960
You probably heard about this.

544
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,640
Some lucky sons of bitches got the game early thanks to Toys R Us, because Toys R Us was

545
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,760
leaking the game out early, and I think I know how this happened.

546
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,040
They usually put those games out in the glass cases and just don't sell them until the day,

547
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,600
like usually the regular clerks, like no, don't sell this until such and such day, but

548
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,840
they have some type of system where they turn the box around or something, but those games

549
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,840
will sit out there in the glass case for like a week and a half before people can buy them,

550
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,600
and apparently some Toys R Us has just made a big boo-boo and sold the game.

551
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
So tons of people are getting this game early.

552
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,720
It's not just Toys R Us, but people I know that do other podcasts that for some reason

553
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,280
get free games sent to them, even though we've never, no, I take that back, we've got a couple,

554
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,640
but we didn't get this one.

555
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,640
There's only one company that loves this.

556
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
Lots of Bioshock.

557
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,560
Lots of Bioshock copies floating around out there, and of course, tens of millions more

558
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,960
come Tuesday, so there you go.

559
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Yeah.

560
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,080
DJ Dark Knight says, huge fine.

561
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
I don't know, what do you think, Logan?

562
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,800
Do you think Toys R Us would get a fine over this?

563
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
I don't think so.

564
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:16,040
What they'll do is, I don't think it's Toys R Us, like it's not chain-wide, it's just

565
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,200
I think it was one or two stores in Jersey that were doing it.

566
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,720
A couple sloppy managers.

567
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,280
And it's just, you know, it's some idiot, and what they'll do is they'll try to track

568
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,160
it down based on the receipts and stuff, and someone will get in trouble there, and that's

569
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
about it.

570
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,800
As long as it's not corporate-wide or something, it's not going to be a huge deal.

571
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,600
They may just get their next game or whatever shipped to them.

572
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,480
They won't get it before street date.

573
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,080
A little slap on the wrist, naughty, naughty.

574
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
No cookie.

575
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,920
Yeah, because there's, what, Target and shit.

576
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Target and Walmart are horrible.

577
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,960
Toys R Us is usually the biggest offender when it comes to breaking street date.

578
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Funny you guys say that.

579
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,920
Son of Dad says, for once it's not Target breaking massive street dates.

580
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,000
Joshi16 says, I would laugh if OLR got a free Madden.

581
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,400
Hey, you know what, please, send me one, because...

582
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,700
I would laugh if we did too, because EA's pretty...

583
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,200
Why not give it a fair shot and give the game a fair shot?

584
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm not going to hold a grudge against it just because it's a sports game.

585
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,160
It deserves a fair shot just like any other game.

586
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,720
Hey, I'm not saying it's a horrible game either.

587
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,060
I'm just saying I don't care for sports games.

588
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,060
Any sports games.

589
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Alright, anyway.

590
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,060
Moving on.

591
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,280
Anyways, so if you don't have your hands on Bioshock yet, you still can get your hands

592
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:31,000
on the art book, which is free to download from Irrational Games.

593
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,880
This was something that they were going to try to put into the limited edition pack that

594
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:43,200
was exclusive to EB and GameStop, but they just ran out of time, so instead they've offered

595
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,140
it for free to download on their website in PDF form, so check it out.

596
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,920
It's Bioshock Breaking the Mold, and it's over 60 pages long.

597
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
Cool.

598
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
Art books are great.

599
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,720
Now, speaking, though, of computery stuff, you know they were saying, well, at least

600
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:06,620
IGN PC reviewed PC Bioshock as much better than the Xbox 360 version, saying that it

601
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,360
handled better, the interface was better by using the mouse and the keyboard.

602
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,680
Which if you're playing a first person shooter, hi, duh!

603
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,060
Well now, wait a minute.

604
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,060
Except, except, except.

605
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,060
It's personal preferences, I think.

606
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,140
Here's the classic debate.

607
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,220
Keyboard and mouse versus analog sticks.

608
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,460
I mean, people, it's like...

609
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,080
Depending on how the game, though, is supposed to be played, the functionality of the game

610
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:32,080
self? Like, okay, what would you rather play Doom on? PC or?

611
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:39,440
Well, okay, I read their review on Bioshock and their thing was, they're saying, for example,

612
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,400
switching your special abilities using the right mouse button instead of the left bumper

613
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,780
on the 360. To be honest, I don't have trouble hitting the left bumper on the 360, it's not

614
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:56,600
hard, I just don't get it. It's just nitpicking shit, is what it is. And they're also saying

615
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,240
the hacking is a little bit easier because you can use the mouse instead of having to

616
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,080
use the analog stick.

617
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,400
Well, say it graphically.

618
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,640
Minor shit, that's all it is.

619
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,840
Well, they were also pointing out, though, that you could run it at a 1920 by 1200.

620
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,760
Well, I'm sure you can do it.

621
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,880
If you've got a PC, hi.

622
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,400
If you have an Uber computer that's fast enough to, I bet if I tried to run it at that resolution

623
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,520
it wouldn't be smooth. That's the other problem. I mean, but that's, you know, PC gaming in

624
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,140
general. You usually have to have the most top-end system to play most of the newer games.

625
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,360
Not all. Like, you know, games like World of Warcraft can run on pretty old machines,

626
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,400
but, you know.

627
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,680
But it's meant to be available to a high audience. You know, a broad range.

628
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,400
I'd try it out on PC. I don't know, though. I'm so used to those types of games now with

629
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,360
the analogs, I don't know. But yeah, like Quake 3, I couldn't not play that on a PC.

630
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,520
Like, you know, there's just some games you really get used to. And, you know, if we want

631
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,640
to go the other way around, Final Fantasy XI, okay?

632
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,000
Well, yeah, we did have that issue, didn't we?

633
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,280
Yeah, yeah. Final Fantasy XI was made for a console. It was made for the PlayStation

634
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,160
2, ported to the PC. I can't fucking play that game with a controller for shit. I have

635
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,760
to have the keyboard to play that game.

636
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,760
But I had absolutely no problem playing it with a controller. I started off with that

637
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,160
crappy little gravis pad I got for ten bucks from Dan's GameStop back in the day. And I

638
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,080
was doing all my macros and crap with my trigger buttons.

639
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,960
You know what? Your wiring is backwards, I think.

640
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,440
What?

641
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,960
The games you're supposed to play with a controller you like to play with keyboard and mouse.

642
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,400
The games you're supposed to play with keyboard and mouse you like with a controller. You're

643
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
backwards.

644
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
No, I'm not.

645
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,400
I'll ask you what it is. Yes, you are.

646
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
All right.

647
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,800
That and, you know, it's kind of hard to play Doom without a keyboard because of, you know,

648
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,200
IDDQD and IDBFG and all that.

649
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:40,760
All right. Let's see. Looking at chat room for comments. Chat.orangelanatrader.com. Sephiroth1215

650
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,960
says, FPS games are usually done in the USA and U.S. companies love to have the best graphics

651
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,920
possible and that's not possible on Wii.

652
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,400
Let's start a little debate there about I'm sure Metroid Prime 3 is coming into the mix

653
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,480
as well now because that game is out, what, next week as well or two weeks?

654
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
Two weeks.

655
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Yeah.

656
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:05,560
Yeah. Let's see. What else is there here? I guess Dark Tetsuya maybe talked about that.

657
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,440
I wish they'd make Red Steel 2 even though they have so much room for improvement.

658
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,360
Lots of room for improvement.

659
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,440
Let's see. Yeah, rostielut says it probably costs three times as much to get a system

660
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,320
that will run Bioshock. Well, we'll see.

661
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,160
All right. Anyway, I'm talking also about the Xbox Live and the PC, you know, things

662
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:32,640
that are on both. Xbox Live Arcade is going to be on its way to the PC in November. The

663
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,700
secret project name was Vega, not, you know, Street Fighter's Vega but Vega the Star.

664
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,300
It's going to be launching in early November 10 to 20 games in the service and I believe

665
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,900
I saw an early screenshot that had like Galaga as one of the games and of course they want

666
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,140
to expand this with two to four new games every month following the launch.

667
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,780
So kind of not surprising when you consider the Microsoft's been trying to bridge the

668
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:00,360
gap between the console and the PC but I don't know. I don't know if I'd buy a lot of these

669
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,840
for PC but my question is if I bought it on Live, would I get to download it for free

670
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,320
on the PC? I think I should.

671
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,640
Of course I'm cheap.

672
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,060
The other thing too I'm wondering is it's going to be a little bit of a harder sell

673
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:19,680
to sell some of these PopCap games that are free online on the PC.

674
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,760
Yeah, but even PopCap like charges, you know, extra money for a downloadable version with

675
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,060
more features. That's where they make their money because whenever you play one of those

676
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,460
games online, they're always saying download the trial version of the Uber version of this

677
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,240
game with more levels and more colors, woo, and all that.

678
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,620
I think what's also interesting about the whole thing is that the 150 megabyte size

679
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,400
limit still applies even to the PC games. That's kind of interesting to me, I don't

680
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
know.

681
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:53,360
Well, I don't know. Anyways, maybe, well actually the 150 meg limit maybe that does tie into

682
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,440
something that they're going to be able to be transferred back and forth or something.

683
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,040
I don't know. I would hope so. Maybe later on or something.

684
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:07,600
Okay, so this is not a big surprise but apparently the news got out that Xbox or Microsoft is

685
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:16,840
just saying is allowing certain MMOs to require hard drive space and require the use of the

686
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,920
Xbox 360 hard drive. Duh, I mean Final Fantasy XI, hello, I mean. But apparently what they're

687
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:28,640
saying is that each title will create a master storage file, one file per title per console

688
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,760
or something like that. And apparently on the box it will say, you know, such and such

689
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,560
storage is required.

690
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,520
Even though XI didn't say that, did it? Well I guess it had to have said it somewhere.

691
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,160
It must have because you had to install it to your hard drive, so. I don't know, I'm

692
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,520
not surprised that MMOs require this. I'm just surprised that normal games haven't gotten

693
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,760
this yet. I still think that that is coming, whether they're saying it or not.

694
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,240
The most shocking thing about that story to me, I was like, there's MMOs in development

695
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,720
for the 360, awesome. Wasn't there that Marvel MMO or something that was coming out to them?

696
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,480
That would be awesome, I'll play that. I don't remember that. I'm like, what MMOs are in

697
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,760
development for 360? I'm just totally spacing it. I know I've heard of something, but I

698
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,760
just, I can't remember. Like what is in development for 360 as an MMO? Well, I don't know. People

699
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,080
go play Phantasy Star Universe. Oh my God, World of Warcraft, it must be true. World

700
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,000
of Warcraft is coming to 360. Oh, shut up. World of Warcraft is never coming to 360.

701
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,920
Leave it on the damn PC. Ragnarok 2. Now that would be sweet. Yeah, I've been trying to

702
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,800
get the, I have to have a Korean social security number apparently. Sucks. Well, no, there's

703
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,480
ways of getting around it, but I've been trying to play the Ragnarok 2 demo. Wow. You're gonna

704
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,920
have to kidnap a Korean child. There's other ways to do that, I don't want a Korean child.

705
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,640
Oh, DJ Dark Knight has a good point. Phantasy Star Universe is also another MMO on the 360.

706
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:54,440
That's what I just said. In fact, the add-on comes out this fall for it if people are still

707
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,040
playing that game. Guess who quit? Ah, that'd be me. I know. I don't know, so I... There's

708
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,520
Julie, she's fully addicted to PSU. There's a part of me that wants to go back to PSU,

709
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,000
but not until I hit 70 in WoW. I hit 64 yesterday, so I'm getting close. The part of me that

710
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,400
wants to go back to playing PSU has been sporked in the head and buried in a deep pit. PSU

711
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,800
wasn't that bad. I had fun with it. I'm glad you did. Thank you, Rob. But there's more

712
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:28,920
fun, better fun. Wait, hold on, I gotta say, Dark Tetsuya says, find at. Did you hear about

713
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,520
the baby this week? That's mine in Korea. Oh, that was China. That's China. Get your

714
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,400
countries right. Get your Asia right, Dark Tetsuya. God, really. That was still kind

715
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:43,800
of funny. A little funny, even if it was wrong, it was funny. I know. You know what, read

716
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,040
the news, people. Go on Yahoo, instead of reading about celebrities in the Paris Hilton

717
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,840
stupid ass, read World News. Well, what if I like to read about celebrities? Like, Perez

718
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,720
Hilton is like in my day. Like, I always say, okay, you gotta visit Kotaku and Destructoid

719
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:06,080
and Joystiq and Perez Hilton. That's basically how I, you know. Okay. I surf the net every

720
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,360
day. I go to Yahoo News, and then I go to CNN.com, and then I read my live journal.

721
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,800
No one cares about our browsing habits. Go to the next story. And then I go to Porno

722
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,420
too. While SteelUT apparently needs an explanation,

723
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,160
some people in China wanted to name their child At, because I think, what, they meet

724
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,440
by email or something? And At is pronounced like Achi or something.

725
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,560
I stopped caring five minutes ago. Which means love him or something. Why don't

726
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:38,640
they just use the actual, you know, symbols for that. Anyway, so whatever. How about something

727
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,080
that should excite some of our more emo people? My Chemical Romance is going to be in Guitar

728
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:52,720
Hero 3. They're doing a three pack, I'm sorry, not Guitar Hero 3, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360.

729
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:01,920
They are doing a three song pack for Xbox Live Marketplace that will have teenagers'

730
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:09,800
famous last words, and this is how I disappear. It is 500 points, AKA $6.25.

731
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,480
And I believe it's actually up now. They're master tracks, by the way, from the

732
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,800
band. And I believe we have a little clip of those

733
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:22,040
songs. So, cause, like, well, you know, cause, because, like, I have no idea who my, well,

734
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
I know who they are, but I don't really listen to these type of bands.

735
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
They did one song that I like. I don't.

736
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,480
That was Cemetery Drive. Like, I knew none of these songs.

737
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:36,480
Say something, Rob. Alright, let's do it.

738
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:10,000
The chat room is all, like, going, no, no, don't play that, why did you do that, why?

739
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,040
And Sephiroth1215, though, says, hey, I hate emo, but the Black Parade is very good.

740
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,720
I don't know, I thought the songs were kind of melodic.

741
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,000
They seem to fit in Guitar Hero 2. I mean, I don't get into the whole emo versus

742
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,880
punk versus whatever else, I don't know. At least you got some new fucking tracks

743
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,680
to download for Guitar Hero 2 that are not Guitar Hero 1.

744
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,560
Amen, there you go. Can't we all agree that that's a good thing,

745
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,640
even if you don't like the particular band they picked?

746
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,480
There you go. Good job.

747
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,800
Alright, well, speaking of Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 3 is going to be getting Slash.

748
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,320
You already knew about that, but they're also going to be having Bret Michaels, if you can

749
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,680
believe it. Bret Michaels is going to be using his face

750
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,160
and his image in the game, just like Slash, and then, of course, in the game, you gotta

751
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,940
get some Poison songs, Talk Dirty to Me by Poison, and go that far from the Bret Michaels

752
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,600
band. So, pretty cool, you can look forward to those

753
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,800
songs in Guitar Hero 3. Unfortunately, we do not have clips of those

754
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,800
songs because I was too lazy to pre-arrange that before the show.

755
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,440
Well, way to go, Rob. My bad.

756
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,360
Anyways, if you happen to be living in Australia, you'll be happy to know that the 360 core

757
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:25,880
has now been price-dropped to compete with the Wii, is now the same price as the Wii,

758
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:35,880
and of course, coinciding with that, the 20GB system has also been dropped down to $579.95

759
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:45,920
Australian, so that's pretty awesome as well. Well, I don't know, dropping the core system

760
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,360
down to where the Wii is, not good enough, I still think.

761
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,880
Well, I don't know, I think it's interesting precedent, I wonder if that's going to happen

762
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,360
over here eventually, where the 360 will get cut back enough, where it can compete with

763
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,000
the Wii like that, but I don't think it'll happen anytime soon.

764
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,920
I think it's also a matter of the markets themselves that want to make it competitive

765
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,120
for the market it's in. Or is it just that Nintendo kind of likes

766
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,160
to screw the people that aren't in Japan or the U.S. by charging more for their systems,

767
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,520
because you know, doesn't the DS and the Wii cost way more? I guess most systems cost way

768
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,640
more in Europe and Australia, Canada. Again, the other thing has to do with what

769
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,520
the general cost of living is and how it relates to that particular area.

770
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,960
I don't think it's actually a very fair comparison to compare American dollars to other currencies,

771
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,080
when it depends on exactly how the currency works within the area it's from.

772
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,640
I'll give you that. Because as far as I know, it's not spending

773
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,820
a whole bunch of money in Europe. But it still creates an interesting choice

774
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,720
when they are the same price in that currency, the Wii and the 360, it's kind of a different

775
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,680
competition that it is here in that regard. But at the same time, if you want to argue

776
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,040
it I guess, that you would need to still buy a memory card in order to be able to save

777
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,240
your games and stuff, versus the Wii, which has built-in memory, although it is extremely

778
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,360
limited. Yeah, and you can't really download a lot

779
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,480
of videos with that. I forgot to mention, I did hear some interesting

780
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,200
news actually. Oh really?

781
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,400
Well not surprising, but the 64 meg memory unit for the 360 is going away.

782
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,240
Really? Yeah.

783
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,160
Where'd you get that? From Microsoft.

784
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,040
Places? Oh, I see.

785
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,280
Okay. Alright, well there you go.

786
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,520
Alright, well moving on. Well, for anyone who has been keeping up with

787
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,800
Sega, there was a rumor going around that they were doing a viking game called Vikings

788
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:54,320
Battle of Asgard, and GameStop has actually stopped listing the PS3 and Xbox 360 version

789
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:01,960
of that on their forthcoming games, and it was to be released in February 2008, but Sega

790
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,960
is not saying anything about it. I mean, they could say something when it comes

791
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:13,160
up to the convention coming up, but other than that, they're nuh-uh.

792
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,480
No hairy vikings! No fjords.

793
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,320
Wasn't there an old school PC game called Vikings or something like that, or what was

794
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,920
something else? I think it was the lost vikings or something?

795
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,200
Yeah, the lost vikings. Was that what it was?

796
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,680
I don't think this is a remake of that. I think it also had a version of the Super

797
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,200
Nintendo, didn't it? I think it did.

798
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,480
Yeah. Alright, anyway, completely different note

799
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:41,280
on Xbox Live Arcade. Apparently, they are developing Crazy Frog Racer?

800
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,800
They're porting it, yeah. Is Crazy Frog Racer already out on PC or something?

801
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,640
It's in the UK. Oh my lord.

802
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:52,880
And it's crap. Crazy Frog is like one of those franchises that really needs to go away.

803
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,520
Well anyway, the folks, it's Graffiti is the company that's working on it, and the CEO

804
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,680
of Graffiti, Kenneth Hurley, actually said this at a recent announcement, quote, we are

805
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,100
excited to jump in on the Xbox 360 and introduce our title to the millions of gamers around

806
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,840
the world playing on the console. But maybe no one wants to play your damn game.

807
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,200
Everything about that? Oh god, the soundtrack alone is going to make

808
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,880
me want to put a gun in my head. I don't get that Crazy Frog thing at all.

809
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,400
Have you heard the Crazy Frog songs, Jamie? I don't know.

810
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,240
Please have a clip. I will get a clip. I will load a clip right

811
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,760
now. Where's the ferret so I can do it it wrong?

812
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,680
While you do the next story. Do the next story and I will get a clip.

813
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,760
Alright, well, you may be waiting for a beautiful Katamari to come out in October, but in the

814
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,320
meantime though, you do have that wonderful demo that's available from Xbox Live.

815
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,200
And in case you want to get a little bit more life out of your demo, or just do something

816
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:58,360
really neat, what you need to do is hold the back and start buttons on your controller

817
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:04,480
as the demo is booting up on the main screen. And it will allow you to play as either the

818
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,540
Prince or Mag, one of Prince's many cousins. So you can actually play as one of the cousins

819
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:13,800
in the demo as well. Yay, that's kind of neat.

820
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,720
Yeah, and we actually have a clip of one of the new songs from Beautiful Katamari right

821
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:37,680
here. You know, if my Xbox, that was Crazy Frog

822
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,160
by the way, if my Xbox started making those type of noises, three red rings of death wouldn't

823
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,920
be enough for what I would do to it. Well, you know what, let's cleanse the palette

824
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:55,320
a little bit away from Retarded Frog. Smack you the frog. Anyway, for people who are still

825
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,440
playing Lost Planets, guess what? The maps are all free. You can just go get them.

826
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:08,440
I like free. They're free.

827
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,520
What else is there to say? Free stuff. Go Kat! Yay, free.

828
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,760
I like that whole concept though of releasing map packs in advance for money for the hardcore

829
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,680
people and then free for the rest of us later. Apparently, according to this, you can trade

830
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,240
in your game and rebuy it for 10 bucks at Toys R Us.

831
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,620
What? Because what this says, it says you can rebuy

832
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,240
it at Toys R Us for $9.99. Wow.

833
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,440
Why the fuck would you trade in your game and then rebuy it for 10 bucks?

834
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,240
It's a profit-making thing, I think. I think they're saying you can sell it back for more

835
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,680
and then buy it for cheap. It's a money-making scheme.

836
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,800
Whatever. I think that's with Madden. What it is is

837
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,520
the game is like 20 bucks right now. Let's see. Joshi16 says Crazy Frog Frogger

838
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,040
would be good. Kill him. They actually have Crazy Frog Racing coming

839
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,560
out on PlayStation 2 in two weeks, actually. Kill me now.

840
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:22,640
Maybe it'll coincide with the Xbox 360 game. Have you ever heard shittier music in your

841
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,000
life? I mean, really? Doesn't this make you want to go and willingly

842
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,560
listen to Britney Spears? It makes me want to go on a car trip with

843
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,560
you. Sorry.

844
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,960
Off a cliff? Hey, I've heard some of the stuff you play

845
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,680
in your car. I disagree with some of it.

846
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,680
Rob. What?

847
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,640
Heart. No, anyway. Let's change the subject. Our chat room's

848
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,560
in pain, and I'm sure many of you are, too. Let's talk about release dates. That's always

849
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,920
a happy subject that will wake us back up and get us all happy again.

850
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,280
Let's go over to Japan first and look at some release dates.

851
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,040
You might remember last week we didn't have a whole lot to report for the Japanese release

852
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,360
date. I hate to tell you, this week's looking pretty

853
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,720
similar. There is a new title on the Nintendo Wii coming

854
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:13,720
out on the 23rd from Compile, and it's called Sharui Takoran, which looks to be some type

855
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:21,720
of game where, I don't know. It's by Compile Heart, and this anime-looking

856
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,920
chick is offering up these little octopus-looking cute things.

857
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,760
I don't really know how else to describe it. It's a puzzle game, though.

858
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,720
Tentacle rape? Eh? No, no tentacle rape in this puzzle game.

859
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,080
No, that's what she's offering up. Tentacle rape, eh?

860
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,280
I don't think she's offering tentacle rape, Loki.

861
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,600
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Peer X Cure Recovery is coming out, and there's

862
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:48,760
also a special set coming out at the same time, and also coming out, Quiz and Variety

863
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:55,080
Suku Suku in Fuku 2. Moto Suku Suku is coming out.

864
00:46:55,080 --> 00:47:00,400
That's what it's called. Okay, are there girls in school uniforms there?

865
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,760
Now check out this screenshot from Peer X Cure, Loki.

866
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:15,600
It looks like she wants a suku suku in the uku.

867
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,520
She's showing a little bit of skirt there, hiking up a little bit.

868
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,000
Okay, fuck Peer X Cure. I don't care about that.

869
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,840
I want to see what this suku suku thing is here.

870
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,480
It's a quiz game, though. Quiz and Variety.

871
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,220
I guess it's these cute little chibi bunny things.

872
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,080
Some are dressed as a knight, and some are dressed as little farms guys.

873
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,240
I guess that's Suku, and that's Fuku. I don't know.

874
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,560
Awesome. They're more descriptive terms, because moto

875
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,960
still is more. Alright, also coming out on the Nintendo DS.

876
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,560
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fates, and I'm sure a lot of you guys like your Crystal

877
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,280
Chronicles, so there you go. You have that to look forward to, and that's

878
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,600
probably the biggest game this week. That and suku suku.

879
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,160
Awesome. Anyways, let's see.

880
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,800
In the US, there's some pretty good stuff to look forward to this week.

881
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:14,320
Just a little game called Bioshock on PlayStation 2, or not PlayStation 2, 360 and PC.

882
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,800
I meant PC for some reason I was looking at a PlayStation 2 game.

883
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,880
OMG, Bioshock's coming to PlayStation 3 after all.

884
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,920
OMG, OMG. OMG, no.

885
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,040
It is not coming to PlayStation 2. PlayStation 2 would melt down if they had

886
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,320
to play that game. On PlayStation 2, though, you can look forward

887
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:35,320
to two wonderful games, including Metropolis Mania 2 and Brunswick Bowling.

888
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:41,440
Awesome, hooray. On PS3 and PSP, you're going to be getting

889
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,880
Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, the delayed edition.

890
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,880
Then, let's see, also, let's see here, on PC and 360 as well, another good RPG, Two

891
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,280
Worlds coming out on both platforms, as well as the Two Worlds Collector's Edition.

892
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:08,280
And, let's see, on PSP, a couple more games, Jean de Arc and Dragonears Aria is also making

893
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,880
its way out. Then, let's see, on the Wii, a whole bunch

894
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:22,880
of nothing, and of course, on the DS, Brain Age 2, more brain training in minutes a day.

895
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,880
Another game that you'll play for one whole day and then stop playing.

896
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:36,160
And this one was really interesting, The Settlers is coming out on DS as well, which isn't that

897
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,280
Settlers of Catan, I think? The Settlers? Sounds familiar.

898
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,640
I don't know, I'll be able to look at that. And then, Operation Vietnam, so you too can

899
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,960
have the flashbacks that everybody is jealous of.

900
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,240
All right, that's government money out of. Real quick, before you get to the Europe dates,

901
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:58,980
I just want to say in chat, Darvoid says that Suku Fuku translates to summer uniform, despite

902
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,200
what you were thinking, sicko. That does look like a summer uniform.

903
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:08,640
Summer is natsu. Well, whatever, let's just move on.

904
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,640
On the 21st, we have Dragonears Aria on PSP. On the 24th, we have Anno 1701 for DS, Blue

905
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:23,600
Dragon on Xbox 360, Glory Days 2, Brotherhood of Men on DS, we have Loki on PC, a bunch

906
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:29,600
of Madden, fuck Madden, MotoGP 07. What's your biggest issue with Madden?

907
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,520
Sucks. I never said, I never, it's the husband and

908
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,960
friends thing. No, I detest American football.

909
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,760
All right, moving on. It's stupid.

910
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,560
I'm not going to argue. Play rugby!

911
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,320
Is Loki coming to Mac? No, it's PC.

912
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:47,480
That's right, and Loki does not come to Mac. I knew that was coming.

913
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,680
You're funny tonight. Can I continue?

914
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,160
Yes, you may. Thank you, sir. On the 24th, we have Pac-Man

915
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,800
Rally. 24th also is Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced

916
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,800
Warfighter 2 for PS3 and PSP, and 24th is Bioshock.

917
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:08,360
No, Bioshock. Are you going to hate that, too?

918
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:15,360
No, if they did a PS2 version, you'd think it would be like Bio Fizz, Bio Zap.

919
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:21,280
All right. I hope Mr. Bubbles gets a spinoff game. That's all I hope for.

920
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:24,200
He should have his own Saturday morning cartoonish show.

921
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,960
Mr. Bubbles Happy Hour! There should be a fighting game, Mr. Bubbles

922
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,640
vs. Pyramid Head. Pyramid Head would win.

923
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:37,760
That would be hardcore. They need to do scary games of the fire.

924
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:44,160
In a fight, though, between Mr. Bubbles, the Big Daddy and Pyramid Head, Mr. Bubbles, Pyramid

925
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,960
Head, and the licker from Resident Evil. I'm sorry. I would say, though, I think that,

926
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,920
you know, seeing in the demo how fast those, you know, Big Daddies move, and Pyramid Head's

927
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,200
just dragging that shit along. I mean, he's kind of slow.

928
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:01,040
Yes, but the only way you can kill Pyramid Head is for him to kill himself.

929
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,240
It's true. All right.

930
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,680
You have to beat him until he falls on his spike because he gets so tired of chasing

931
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,040
your stupid butt around. Seriously, what the hell happened to this

932
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,440
show tonight? We're random.

933
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,400
All right, anyway. But I do issue a challenge to anyone who's

934
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,240
working on our Moogan for us. Put Pyramid Head in there for me, please.

935
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:23,560
And label him P. Hiddy. I forgot about the Moogan thing.

936
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,880
It's P. Hiddy. Well, it was O.L.R. vs. A.G.I., right?

937
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,200
So it'd be, like, you, me, and Loki are all playable characters, and Scott, Mary Young,

938
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,360
and Jessica are all playable characters. Then maybe, like, Bobby B. for good measure,

939
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,360
and we could put one of our people, like Travis Donovan or D.M.N. or somebody can be a playable

940
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,480
character. And then P. Hiddy.

941
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:48,640
It just shows up. Random boss. He'd be like Noob Saibot.

942
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,320
It'd be smoke. All right.

943
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,760
Moving on. I'm looking at it.

944
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,640
Chat room is very random here. GS68 says, I want Dark Sakura the game, which

945
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:07,640
would more or less be Burnout O.L.R. edition. You don't know how right you are.

946
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,080
You just totally see her driving down the freeway. Let's see what else is there.

947
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:16,760
Joshi16 says, Bioshock on the Atari 2600. That'll be interesting.

948
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,520
All right. Anyhow, how about Wipeout on the Playstation 3?

949
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,780
A lot of folks want to see this game, and you might get to see it a little sooner than

950
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,220
later. You might, might, might, might get to see

951
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:31,840
it at Leipzig. A demo for the Sony Playstation Network release

952
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:38,160
of Wipeout HD apparently has been rated by the UK's version, I'm sorry, Germany's version

953
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,240
of the ESRB, and supposedly it's going to be at Leipzig Game Convention.

954
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,600
It was already formally announced. We know the game is coming.

955
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,960
It was already said that it was coming at E3 2007, and it's supposed to be released

956
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,920
before the end of the year. Wipeout HD, of course, will have high def.

957
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,160
It's Wipeout for the Playstation 3. What else do you need to know?

958
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,160
Why can't they just release a demo on the Playstation Network since there's hard landing

959
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,480
demos on there in the first place? Because people are really critical of demos

960
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,600
and stuff, and they probably want to make sure that, you know, because even though I

961
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,820
said earlier I wasn't going to base my full opinion of a game off a demo, there's a lot

962
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:17,080
of people that will, and I'm not perfect either. I've done it before, so.

963
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:21,120
So there you go. Another interesting thing, apparently Calling

964
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:28,400
All Cars is going to be transferable to the PSP, at least that's the rumor.

965
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:37,760
This is coming from a European magazine, PSP, the official guidebook, and no word on if

966
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,840
that's even true or not, but it would be interesting. I don't know.

967
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:51,680
Maybe sell some more copies on PSP that way. I don't know, is anyone interested in this

968
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,880
game? I know I looked at it and I was like, eh.

969
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,800
I have no idea what you're talking about. I've been ignoring it.

970
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:06,800
Alrighty then. I mean, is it supposed to be exciting?

971
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,520
Well, the game itself, you know, basically is kind of a cops and robbers type thing.

972
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,320
It's all done in, you know, cartoony cel-shaded and stuff.

973
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,880
Yeah, wasn't that, wasn't actually that an old show?

974
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,400
No. Oh, that was Car 54, Where Are You?

975
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,480
Yeah. That was a cool show.

976
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,080
I think there was a show called Calling All Cars, but I think it has nothing to do with

977
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:30,200
this, actually. I hear about the game and then it just goes

978
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,840
out of my head. I like the fact that it's transferable.

979
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,080
That's kind of a neat feature. I mean, that's something that Xbox Live is

980
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,640
never going to be able to really deliver because there is no portable Microsoft system yet,

981
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,840
but that's kind of neat. Wait.

982
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,680
I know, wait. Well, for anybody else, though, who's interested

983
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:52,560
in anything Sony has going on, there are going to be, they've actually got some dates released

984
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:58,000
from 3Speech for UK. First coming out is Warhawk on the 28th of

985
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:07,120
August on PSN and 21st September release for Blu-ray.

986
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:18,120
And also it's going to cost 19.99 pounds at 29 euros.

987
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:25,600
It will be, let's see, there will be extra video content, a manual and a Bluetooth headset

988
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:31,760
if you pay the 39.99 pounds to get it on the Blu-ray hard copy.

989
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:38,160
Heavenly Sword is going to be rumored as the 14th of September with Folklore and Lair on

990
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:48,200
12th and 26th October, of course, respective. And that's nothing really yet said about SingStar

991
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,640
for PS3. Will you guys be getting Lair at your house,

992
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,340
Jamie? Because I really want to see that game.

993
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:58,000
We could get it. I mean, we can rent whatever we want to.

994
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Oh, that's cool. Because I'm kind of, you know, I still haven't

995
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,200
bought a PlayStation 3, but there are certain games I really would like to see that, you

996
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,240
know, may change my opinion on PlayStation 3 and finally get one, and that's one of them.

997
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,480
I can't remember if I have Lair on order or not.

998
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,400
I think I'm getting, I know I'm getting Heavenly Sword.

999
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,400
Oh yeah, that too. And then Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of

1000
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,820
Destruction. I think by Christmas I'll have finally caved

1001
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,680
and buy a PlayStation 3, I think. We'll see.

1002
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,920
The longer you wait, the better a deal you're going to get.

1003
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,580
That's true. So I'm trying to hold out, and I, well, also

1004
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,080
the fact that I just don't have a lot of money right now, so.

1005
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,840
And just remember, all the good games you're looking forward to aren't coming out until

1006
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,440
next spring at least. True. True.

1007
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:42,320
Anyways, I'll hold up. Well, moving on, let's talk about free, because,

1008
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,440
you know, if I can't buy new consoles, then I'm going to get free stuff, because I like

1009
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:50,680
free stuff. One thing that's now free is Ark Lord.

1010
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:55,400
If you are an MMO fan, hopefully you've heard of this game, but if you haven't, Codemasters

1011
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:01,440
Online Gaming has made its online RPG, Ark Lord, completely free to play.

1012
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,680
There's an all-new expansion also available for download.

1013
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:09,440
The director of marketing at COG noted, quote, Since its release, Ark Lord has grown consistently

1014
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,160
and we are excited to throw open the doors to players across North America and Europe

1015
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:19,720
looking to play a premium, 100% free MMORPG. There's got to be a catch.

1016
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,440
What's the catch? There must be a catch.

1017
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:27,800
Is there ads or something? It says, I'm looking at the official website

1018
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:33,520
here, zero fees, download the free game now. I might check it out just for shits and giggles.

1019
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,760
I thought that was, someone said that Overlord was based off that game, and I don't think

1020
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,560
so, but possibly. The name sounds familiar, or similar, I should

1021
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,040
say. Similarish name.

1022
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,520
Rasteel UT says, Next week, Ark Lord closes down.

1023
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:54,320
Enjoy it while it lasts. Well, speaking of enjoying it while it lasts,

1024
00:58:54,320 --> 00:59:02,320
you may be familiar with a wonderful spin-off into the porno world called World of Warcraft.

1025
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:07,960
Well, guess what? They've decided to move off of World of Warcraft and move into the

1026
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:14,560
ever-expanding realm of first person shooters. Yes, they have just created FPS porn.

1027
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:21,680
Operation Sex, Cock and Load. That is the actual fucking name of this thing.

1028
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:28,600
It is a gaming-themed porn series that is, of course, based off of games like Counter-Strike,

1029
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:33,840
Ghost Recon, and Rainbow Six, and involves a lot of people running around shooting fake

1030
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:41,400
guns and yelling stuff and sex. That's the best combination ever.

1031
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:45,000
That's a list list in the making we need to do next week.

1032
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,720
Random things you should have in a porn game. No, what video game should be turned into

1033
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,680
porn? Like Biocock. Could be maybe an FPS that comes

1034
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,960
out in the future. Cocking Mama.

1035
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:01,520
Cocking Mama? What the hell is wrong with you?

1036
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:09,480
Mama will fix it, naughty boy. Okay, I didn't say that.

1037
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,160
Attention internet, DarkSakura would like to see Cocking Mama.

1038
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:20,320
No! Not me. I was just thinking of names.

1039
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:26,320
Looking at comments in the chat room, NintendoManiac64 says FPS, first person sex.

1040
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:31,140
No, it's not first person sex, because that's POV sex, by the way.

1041
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,680
That's a whole different genre. Just stop.

1042
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,720
This is actually first person, where they've got the gun and everything, and they're firing

1043
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,800
the gun and reloading it just like you would see in a first person shooter game, except

1044
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:46,960
they stop and have sex every now and then. Because when you're in the middle of terrorist

1045
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:54,080
warfare, you have to stop and have sex. They have to reload.

1046
01:00:54,080 --> 01:01:00,520
This is so mature tonight. RasteelUT sticks his head in a meat grinder.

1047
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,640
Yay, good job. You've got the guy who's always ragging on

1048
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:08,920
us, put his head in the meat grinder. No, I'm just kidding.

1049
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:16,080
joshi16 says train your cock in minutes a day. RasteelUT says cooking mama bobbit.

1050
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:24,360
Footy in Toronto says Nintendcats in itself is a sex game. Nintendpussy.

1051
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:31,820
We are so mature. This show has sunk to the level of dick and

1052
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,920
fart jokes. Congratulations, everybody.

1053
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:40,080
You ever remember X-Man and Custer's Revenge? Of course I remember Custer's Revenge.

1054
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,600
I haven't played X-Man, but I've heard you talk about it.

1055
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,600
Got it. Good times.

1056
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,160
All right, let's take a break. That sounds like a good idea, Rob.

1057
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,280
This show's getting a little crazy. We're going to take a quick break.

1058
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,640
We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1059
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,380
