00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:24,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, August 19th, 2007, the Wii and the 360 are the same price in one country, Guitar Hero 3 gets a little poison, and is a Wii Mode coming to the PlayStation 2?

2
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:36,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:42,762
[SPEAKER_02]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:47,986
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-host, DarkSakura.

5
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:48,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

6
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:50,528
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Miss Jamie Summers?

7
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:51,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here.

8
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:51,949
[SPEAKER_02]: You're here?

9
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,110
[SPEAKER_02]: You're alive and well?

10
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, quite.

11
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:55,432
[SPEAKER_02]: All is good in the hood?

12
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:56,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And not hungover.

13
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:56,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

14
00:00:57,393 --> 00:01:01,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to watch DarkSakura get drunk last night.

15
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:01,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll drink everybody.

16
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:03,321
[SPEAKER_02]: and No Hangover.

17
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:04,042
[SPEAKER_04]: No Hangover.

18
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:04,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

19
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:06,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember what you drank?

20
00:01:06,663 --> 00:01:07,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you run down real quick?

21
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:08,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I can.

22
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:10,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a shot of cold sake.

23
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I had 28 ounces of Kirin beer.

24
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:23,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I had six martinis, two of them being palm tinis, one key lime pie and Adam and Eve because it was very tasty.

25
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,410
[SPEAKER_04]: It was apple.

26
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I had...

27
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:29,054
[SPEAKER_04]: A guavatini, I had, what was that?

28
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh God, I can't remember the first one.

29
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:31,317
[SPEAKER_04]: The chocolate martini.

30
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:36,744
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I had a shot of Glenlivet scotch.

31
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:40,254
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello!

33
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:04,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Who did not join us last night.

34
00:02:04,794 --> 00:02:05,375
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I did not.

35
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:06,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's alright.

36
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:11,319
[SPEAKER_02]: You weren't invited, because it was a bachelorette party, so straight men don't get to go to bachelorette parties, unfortunately.

37
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:12,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob went to mine.

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,162
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's not a straight man.

39
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:15,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

40
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I was saying you went to mine.

41
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I invited you.

42
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:24,389
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, my boyfriend got very, very drunk last night, and Jamie definitely outdrank him.

43
00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:25,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like next to nothing.

44
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:25,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway...

45
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:26,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares.

46
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,111
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to hear the video game chat.

47
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:29,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what did you do last night?

48
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:30,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was something gaming related.

49
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:33,073
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

50
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:37,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, I went and saw the movie Superbad, and it was awesome.

51
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:38,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it good?

52
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:39,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

53
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:39,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.

54
00:02:39,996 --> 00:02:43,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen, like, I think I saw, like, three-fourths of The 40-Year-Old Virgin.

55
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I just never finished it, and then I didn't see that knocked up.

56
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't even compare it to it.

57
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:47,980
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even anything like that.

58
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,520
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like...

59
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:50,642
[SPEAKER_01]: American Pie, but less retarded.

60
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:53,865
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever seen Knocked Up... We should put that on the poster.

61
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,466
[SPEAKER_01]: It's American Pie, but less retarded.

62
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:58,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you've seen Knocked Up, it kind of has that same vibe to it.

63
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:09,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of crude jokes and stuff like that, but it's still very... You don't go into it like... There's no real gross-out moments or anything like that.

64
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:10,718
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of...

65
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:12,486
[SPEAKER_01]: You can relate to it, I guess.

66
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,427
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like freshman year type American Pie?

67
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:42,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Jaded says no, we don't want to hear the video game chat.

68
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:43,535
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to hear the drunken people chat.

69
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:09,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

70
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:14,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of our podcast subscribers might disagree with you, so we will get to game chat very soon.

71
00:04:14,429 --> 00:04:21,592
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I mean, you can read about the news pretty much anywhere on the Internet, but we like to put our personal touch on things and hear from you guys.

72
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:24,393
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we always invite you guys to chat.orangelongeradio.com.

73
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:28,654
[SPEAKER_02]: RossDLUT says, crude jokes does not equal good comedy.

74
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sephiroth1215 says, Superbad was okay.

75
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:32,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I was laughing the whole time.

76
00:04:33,616 --> 00:04:33,896
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

77
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:48,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially, you know, there's a whole... I don't want to ruin it, but there's a part where you find out that one of the characters had a really bad habit when he was growing up, and it had to do with doodling things, and...

78
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:55,424
[SPEAKER_01]: That part, it's super funny when they show it, and after the credits, there's more of that stuff, and it's hilarious.

79
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:56,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll take your word for it.

80
00:04:57,105 --> 00:05:03,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, okay, so to bring things back to video games, and we transition to How Was Your Gaming Week, could there be a super bad video game?

81
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:05,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, as movies do very good, sometimes they get turned into video games.

82
00:05:05,948 --> 00:05:06,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope not.

83
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:09,447
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Napoleon Dynamite game coming out.

84
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:15,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking, I was like, you know, speaking of things that jumped the shark, I'm really surprised there's not a Napoleon Dynamite game.

85
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:15,712
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there is.

86
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:16,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

87
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:19,474
[SPEAKER_01]: DS and PSP, it looks stupid.

88
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:20,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Horrible.

89
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:21,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

90
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:25,799
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I mean, it's not even coming out remotely.

91
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,681
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like an anniversary of that movie or anything like that.

92
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:35,887
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, oh, by the way, we decided, you know, let's make a movie for this or a game for this that's, you know, years after the movie.

93
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:38,389
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's one thing... Gosh.

94
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,674
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's one thing I really hate, it is video games based on shitty movies that shouldn't be turned into video games.

95
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:46,075
[SPEAKER_04]: They should do Xanadu, the game.

96
00:05:46,335 --> 00:05:47,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that might be okay, actually.

97
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:49,537
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be all animated by Don Bluth.

98
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:53,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes when movies are so bad, they're kind of good.

99
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Showgirls, the game, I'd buy that.

100
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:58,803
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Betty Boop game coming out in fucking October.

101
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:01,265
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, come on!

102
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:04,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, you missed the boat a long time ago with that.

103
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't we past the 1930s, Hive?

104
00:06:06,578 --> 00:06:08,019
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

105
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I beat the first area, the first town.

106
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:36,491
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

107
00:06:58,504 --> 00:06:59,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll give you that.

108
00:06:59,664 --> 00:06:59,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

109
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:04,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have a soft spot for four, but I think that's just because that was my first one.

110
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:05,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and you spoonied Bard.

111
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:06,246
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway.

112
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:07,846
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but, but, but, but, but, but.

113
00:07:08,447 --> 00:07:09,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I touched it today.

114
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:11,107
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

115
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:11,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy VI?

116
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:12,348
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

117
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:12,788
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

118
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:13,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Metroid.

119
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:14,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

120
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:20,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked up my Super Nintendo today and was going to pack it up and bring it over here, and then Dan informed me, oh, we're lending that to Adam.

121
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God you got it as a second guess, because the third guess wasn't much better for me.

122
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:24,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

123
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:29,834
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, I do own Kirby's Avalanche.

124
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:31,915
[SPEAKER_04]: So there.

125
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:33,156
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

126
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:37,619
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just saying, Super Metroid comes out on Virtual Console next week, but you were like, shh.

127
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:38,300
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

128
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,661
[SPEAKER_02]: That was exactly the noise you made when I said it was coming out on Virtual Console.

129
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:41,162
[SPEAKER_02]: You were like, shh.

130
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:42,362
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

131
00:07:42,382 --> 00:07:43,143
[SPEAKER_03]: We're playing the real one.

132
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the emulation on Wii is pretty good.

133
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:45,525
[SPEAKER_02]: We're playing the real one.

134
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:46,565
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to play the real one.

135
00:07:46,826 --> 00:07:47,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie and I failed.

136
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:50,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Either that, or I have to see if my HoriPad will work.

137
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:53,650
[SPEAKER_02]: We failed to have our Super Metroid night, but we are going to have it soon.

138
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:54,331
[SPEAKER_02]: We've...

139
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:55,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to your local flea market and pay $5

140
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:22,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to chat and reading some stuff here.

141
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:24,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Son of Dad is talking about movie-based games.

142
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the Nacho Libre game?

143
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:27,014
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

144
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:27,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, unfortunately I did.

145
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:28,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully I don't.

146
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I played that.

147
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:30,875
[SPEAKER_01]: That was on the DS.

148
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:33,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's, like, what other crap's coming up?

149
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:42,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Arctic Tail, which, for those who may not know, Arctic Tail is going to be a brand new movie, kind of like March of the Penguins, except with polar bears and, like, seals.

150
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what was the other one they had?

151
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:46,061
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Feet.

152
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:47,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Feet sucked.

153
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:48,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

154
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:52,464
[SPEAKER_01]: The movie was okay, but at least Happy Feet was not a documentary, though.

155
00:08:52,664 --> 00:09:00,430
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, there was singing and dancing in there, so you can kind of, you know, turn that into a pretty good game, I guess.

156
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,432
[SPEAKER_02]: TigerClaw says, Sky, what about the Alvin and Chipmunk games?

157
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:04,973
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be kind of like Guitar Hero.

158
00:09:05,553 --> 00:09:10,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but Alvin and Chipmunk, so that's another movie tie-in game for, you know, it's going to be crap.

159
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:15,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, like, the new Alvin and the Chipmunks makes me want to throw up in my mouth, okay?

160
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:18,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, when I saw the poster and everything, it looks like crap.

161
00:09:18,623 --> 00:09:22,227
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just never liked the original to begin with, to be honest.

162
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:25,030
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not one thing from my childhood I fondly remember.

163
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,452
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were kind of stupid.

164
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:28,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason Lee is such a sellout now.

165
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:32,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, what the fuck happened since the VSQ days?

166
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked My Name is Earl.

167
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:39,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I don't like that show, but credit to that at least, that's a little different.

168
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:46,222
[SPEAKER_01]: But come on, I mean, seriously, the Alvin Chipmunk shit, I mean... Alright, now we're getting back into movie podcasting.

169
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get back to the games.

170
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:48,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there anything else you wanted to share?

171
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:54,805
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Earl of the TV show, and the only reason I saw that is because you were there, they were watching it at my Fourth of July party.

172
00:09:55,565 --> 00:10:02,807
[SPEAKER_01]: The only game that I think this year that's going to be any good that's tied in with sort of a movie, and it's not even really based on a movie, The Simpsons game.

173
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:05,062
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be fucking awesome.

174
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:06,082
[SPEAKER_01]: That is it.

175
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:28,039
[SPEAKER_04]: I prefer playing the actual game on the actual, that's just how I've always been.

176
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,480
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a good point to emulation.

177
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Translated Japanese RPGs.

178
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Seiken Densetsu 3.

179
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:37,141
[SPEAKER_02]: The quintessential translated game you must play.

180
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:40,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they went and translated the graphics in the game.

181
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Final Fantasy V before Square brought it over here.

182
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:44,903
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the other biggie.

183
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:50,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a very, very well translated, or even, I had a translated Panorama Cotton once.

184
00:10:50,645 --> 00:10:50,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

185
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,759
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Ninja Pass!

186
00:11:10,957 --> 00:11:13,998
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, anything else you want to share for your gaming week?

187
00:11:14,118 --> 00:11:14,298
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

188
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:15,878
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

189
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:17,919
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to play as much as possible.

190
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:23,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Casserone a little bit, the demo for that, and it's pretty interesting, actually.

191
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:31,162
[SPEAKER_01]: I could kind of get into it, you know, because I know Nelly's been hooked on Catan, and I had to literally drag the 360 to a different room.

192
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:33,563
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I could actually play some games on it.

193
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:35,223
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty cool.

194
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:40,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the one demo everyone's been playing this week would be Bioshock.

195
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:42,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried that, and it's awesome.

196
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:45,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So awesome that I decided to pre-order my game after I played it.

197
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,967
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, let's see here.

198
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Also played some more Beautiful Katamari.

199
00:11:53,148 --> 00:11:53,989
[SPEAKER_01]: All three minutes of it.

200
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:55,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And then...

201
00:11:57,437 --> 00:12:00,258
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Overlord some more, and that's actually been pretty fun.

202
00:12:00,338 --> 00:12:01,718
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty surprised.

203
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:09,460
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I'd get tired of the game pretty quick and kind of hesitated to purchase it originally, but I'm actually very satisfied with the game.

204
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,761
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty fun, and it's really the game itself.

205
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:24,624
[SPEAKER_01]: You try to be good in it, and I think it's harder to be good in the game than evil, but after a while, the NPCs just really piss you off, and you just go and decide to kill everybody, and that's the way you should do it, I think.

206
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:35,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I played me and my Katamari on the PSP and tried to remind myself why I hated it on the PSP in the first place, and that would be the controls.

207
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:38,679
[SPEAKER_01]: They suck balls without having a second analog stick on there.

208
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, because for some reason we're a glutton for punishment with that game.

209
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:48,984
[SPEAKER_01]: It's

210
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:58,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how this is fucking possible, but the game actually glitches in new ways.

211
00:12:58,503 --> 00:13:01,926
[SPEAKER_01]: It just progressively evolves into a worse game.

212
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:03,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why.

213
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,888
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just weird.

214
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:08,992
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a guy's own conscience or something.

215
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:12,555
[SPEAKER_01]: It just fucking gets worse, and I don't know how.

216
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:13,696
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does.

217
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:18,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet we'll still play it until they release another fucking Grand Theft Auto game that has multiplayer.

218
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,961
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all I played.

219
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:26,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I played Track and Field.

220
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:27,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Hated it.

221
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:28,304
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't like it?

222
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:29,364
[SPEAKER_01]: No, didn't care for it.

223
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:30,505
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's dumb fun.

224
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:33,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's totally a brainless type of game, Track and Field.

225
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:39,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't bought the full retail one, but I've played the old school one on the computer.

226
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:41,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was in the arcade at one time.

227
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:42,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was.

228
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:43,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember playing an arcade one a long time ago.

229
00:13:43,853 --> 00:13:46,695
[SPEAKER_01]: They should remake it into the arcade with a DDR pad type thing.

230
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:48,096
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a little bit more...

231
00:13:48,721 --> 00:14:16,030
[SPEAKER_02]: put it in like sports bars or something Konami has both yeah uh my gaming week um you know not a lot of new stuff to try out this week you know obviously there's Madden but sports games are typically not my cup of tea so I passed on that um so just kind of playing the old stuff World of Warcraft, Boom Boom Rocket oh yeah I played that too what Boom Boom Rocket or World of Warcraft how'd that go for you you were here oh yeah that's right der anyway um let's see what else I play um

232
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:25,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Echo the Dolphin, I downloaded and tried out on Xbox Live, and I have to admit, I thought the game was overrated when I first played it.

233
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Many years ago, I think it's overrated now.

234
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:28,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of the Echo series.

235
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I never understood why people love that so much.

236
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:33,210
[SPEAKER_04]: You're breaking my heart.

237
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,950
[SPEAKER_04]: They need Calibri.

238
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,370
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

239
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,051
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like Calibri either.

240
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:42,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Hexic 2 just to see maybe if the sequel was any better than the first one because I didn't really care for the first one too much.

241
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:43,655
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one's kind of fun.

242
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I found the second one to be easier, actually.

243
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:46,737
[SPEAKER_01]: It was weird.

244
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:47,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

245
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,679
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing because the first one is really hard.

246
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:57,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was able to create a lot of, I don't remember what they are, but basically create some sort of ring thing and it turns into something else.

247
00:14:57,885 --> 00:14:58,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

248
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can probably play a lot of that game.

249
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,268
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like that it's not free, though.

250
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,532
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing.

251
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:07,997
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually something I do need to mention that someone reminded me in the chat room.

252
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:11,282
[SPEAKER_04]: We did have an instance of the M word in my house as I left.

253
00:15:11,963 --> 00:15:12,584
[SPEAKER_02]: What, Madden?

254
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:14,948
[SPEAKER_02]: The M word.

255
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:16,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck.

256
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:17,893
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

257
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:43,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

258
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:48,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, DarkSakura, your heart is going to break a little more based on chat comments here.

259
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Gold Banjo says, Echo the Dolphin isn't even worth an emulation download.

260
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:53,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, your mom!

261
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:58,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Sephiroth1215 says, I didn't like Echo, but I really liked the Tides of Time.

262
00:15:58,857 --> 00:15:59,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Tides of Time was great.

263
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:04,821
[SPEAKER_02]: RawSteelUT says, Echo would be good if it weren't harder than real-life nuclear warfare.

264
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:05,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't that hard.

265
00:16:06,718 --> 00:16:08,199
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

266
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:33,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the only thing I can think that make that game any better.

267
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so I instead played demos.

268
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:39,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the thing, like, Bioshock, okay?

269
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:42,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I was not getting excited about Bioshock at all.

270
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:49,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, oh hooray, it's another first person shooter, looks all sci-fi, doesn't really look like a game I want to get into.

271
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:55,223
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I even went and I posted on my Twitter, because I have a lot of gaming people that I know on Twitter,

272
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:58,444
[SPEAKER_02]: and other independent podcast people, among other things.

273
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:03,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually made a post on Twitter that said something about like, so what's the big deal?

274
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:04,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here it is.

275
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:06,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's so awesome about Bioshock?

276
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:07,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not knocking it.

277
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:10,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious because usually I don't get too excited for first-person shooters.

278
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:17,316
[SPEAKER_02]: and then GamerAndy replied to me and said, frankly, it's the immersive environment jam-packed with atmosphere and the story.

279
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:18,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Irrational makes good games.

280
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,181
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm reading all these reviews like, what, it has like a 99 on Metacritic?

281
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:25,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay, I gotta see what's so frippin' fabulous about this game, right?

282
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So I downloaded the demo.

283
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, it really is that good.

284
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:32,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if the demo is any sign of what the game is gonna be...

285
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:34,693
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

286
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Looked at the fire and the water and I stood there and stared at it for like 30 seconds.

287
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:01,048
[SPEAKER_01]: My other friend that played it too, he's just like looking at it like, damn, that looks really good.

288
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:06,672
[SPEAKER_02]: The graphics in this game are hands down like, you know, and I really don't like reviewing a game based on the demo.

289
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:08,093
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me say that up front.

290
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:13,858
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think especially in this day and age, you can use a demo as a pretty good sign of what's to come for the game.

291
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've seen a better looking game, period.

292
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the game looks like phenomenal.

293
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:19,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.

294
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:20,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was scary.

295
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:27,232
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know though if I'll end up actually buying the full retail version just because I'm so horrible at first person shooters.

296
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:28,854
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so bad at them.

297
00:18:28,954 --> 00:18:30,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I am too, but you know what?

298
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:31,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't be able to play it.

299
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I purchased it.

300
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:35,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to get the limited edition so I can get the big daddy for my desk at work.

301
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:37,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Bioshock Bioshock

302
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,600
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

303
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:27,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So the game looks, I mean, it really, I mean, usually there's a part of me that wants to go, oh, it can't be that good.

304
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:28,931
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't be that good.

305
00:19:28,971 --> 00:19:30,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is everybody praising this game?

306
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:32,834
[SPEAKER_02]: It really, like, you really have to try it, like, seriously.

307
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:36,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, going to chat room here.

308
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:39,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Darvoid says, Bioshock demo is fun.

309
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:42,142
[SPEAKER_02]: ChainsawJuggling says it's the best game ever.

310
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait till Tuesday.

311
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like they're going to have a hit on their hands there.

312
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:49,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Joshi16 says, damn, I want my Bioshock.

313
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:50,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

314
00:19:51,616 --> 00:19:54,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

315
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:13,023
[SPEAKER_02]: in pretty HD graphics.

316
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:14,084
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right.

317
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:16,646
[SPEAKER_02]: The sad thing is, I think there's a part of me that doesn't care either.

318
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:21,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll probably end up buying the damn game, despite all the drama that happened on this program because of that game.

319
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:23,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

320
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:25,954
[SPEAKER_02]: It is still somewhat addicting, and I'm looking forward to multiplayer.

321
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:32,380
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still kind of look at it with shifty eyes going, did you have to reuse the same frickin' song on the title screen?

322
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,551
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of the same gag over and over.

323
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:35,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

324
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:40,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see something a little bit different, but I'm hoping some of the new modes will make me feel a little bit better about things.

325
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:42,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was that.

326
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:43,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it was a three-minute demo.

327
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:44,638
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really tell a lot off of that.

328
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:49,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Darvoid says, it better not be $60 Katamari.

329
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,024
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's like, I think, $30 or $40.

330
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:53,824
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like cheap.

331
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:54,285
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

332
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:59,769
[SPEAKER_02]: NintendoManiac64 says, so Sky, is Bioshock the Ocarina of Time of first-person shooters?

333
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:02,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I don't want to base my entire opinion of a game off a demo.

334
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:06,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it damn well could be based off of the early reviews.

335
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:13,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Green Time wasn't that great of a game anyways, and I still don't know what everyone's, I still don't know what the hell everyone's big deal is with that game.

336
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:17,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in the Zelda universe, the Super Nintendo Link to the Past will always be the best one to make.

337
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:17,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

338
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:18,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Always be the best one.

339
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:20,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.

340
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Always, Jamie, always.

341
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,183
[SPEAKER_04]: You sound like a Maxi Pet commercial, Rob.

342
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:27,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate you.

343
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,027
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't.

344
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:30,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Housekeeping.

345
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:31,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do some housekeeping tonight.

346
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:34,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the only housekeeping we really have tonight is going to affect the live listeners.

347
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:38,496
[SPEAKER_02]: We just found out literally five minutes before we went live tonight.

348
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:40,737
[SPEAKER_02]: We found out five minutes before we went live.

349
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:42,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Live 365 is shutting down at 8 p.m.

350
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:43,138
[SPEAKER_02]: tonight.

351
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:48,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to screw some of you live listeners out of some of the perks of listening live, and we apologize.

352
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the bonus segment we do in between and the afterbirth just because of the maintenance.

353
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:54,363
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try and cram all the show in before 8 p.m.,

354
00:21:55,323 --> 00:22:01,350
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to rearrange Skype line a little bit too and do it in the beginning of Part B tonight and not at the end of Part B as we usually do.

355
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:06,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to cut out a few segments as well like the mailbag just because we got one email this whole week.

356
00:22:06,596 --> 00:22:07,817
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to roll it over to next week.

357
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:09,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

358
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:11,521
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to hear from you, your comments on the story.

359
00:22:11,782 --> 00:22:13,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Bioshock is all that?

360
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:16,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear from people that played the Bioshock demo and didn't like it.

361
00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:21,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, please speak up, because I always love to hear devil's advocate perspectives.

362
00:22:21,932 --> 00:22:23,233
[SPEAKER_02]: So, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

363
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:27,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And the language of the week I want to email in is Italian, even though I can't read Italian for shit.

364
00:22:28,197 --> 00:22:28,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Be quiet.

365
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:31,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I can still read French.

366
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so sorry you guys about the downtime tonight.

367
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:36,644
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing we can really do about it.

368
00:22:36,664 --> 00:22:38,686
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try and finish the show before 8, but we'll see.

369
00:22:39,006 --> 00:22:44,811
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to mention, though, podcast awards, they're over, you know,

370
00:22:45,168 --> 00:22:45,809
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

371
00:23:00,487 --> 00:23:20,079
[SPEAKER_02]: and we've always said if we can't win it ourselves it's best another independent podcast win it and another one did so there you go good job and they've had a lot of like success this year too and a lot of drama with the whole like what that lawsuit or no not one lawsuit subpoena the subpoena against them and everything try to get the Circuit City ad foreign members it's been a fun year

372
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:22,229
[SPEAKER_02]: to be a CagCast listener.

373
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So, good job for those guys.

374
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,193
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're actually up for two awards.

375
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:31,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see them win the other one they were nominated for, but they don't find out about the other one until the actual awards ceremony.

376
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:37,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if any of them are listening, let me just tell you this much, and I think I can speak for Jamie on this.

377
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:39,185
[SPEAKER_01]: The award show is kind of lame.

378
00:23:39,906 --> 00:23:40,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is.

379
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:41,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have gotten better.

380
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:43,409
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have good nibbly food.

381
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was about...

382
00:23:46,574 --> 00:23:50,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to say by a distance of a foot and a half, I level with Adam Curry's butt.

383
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:54,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not joking.

384
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And I couldn't really appreciate it properly because, you know, he doesn't really have a nice butt and I had the flu.

385
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:01,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, please can we get into game chat now?

386
00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:04,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I do not want to turn this into the Adam Curry's butt podcast.

387
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:11,091
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will turn it into the Bioshock podcast because I'll be damned if the internet isn't abuzz about the game this week.

388
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:12,812
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a quick story on Bioshock.

389
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:13,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

390
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:37,738
[SPEAKER_02]: before people can buy them.

391
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:40,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently some Toys R Us has just made a big boo-boo and sold the game.

392
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,019
[SPEAKER_02]: All the more reason not to ship them early.

393
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,640
[SPEAKER_02]: So tons of people are getting this game early.

394
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:52,181
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just Toys R Us, but people I know that do other podcasts that for some reason get free games sent to them, even though we've never... No, I take that back.

395
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:52,741
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a couple.

396
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:54,101
[SPEAKER_02]: But we didn't get this one.

397
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:55,522
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only one company that loves us.

398
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:56,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of Bioshock.

399
00:24:56,382 --> 00:24:58,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of Bioshock copies floating around out there.

400
00:24:58,482 --> 00:25:01,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, tens million more come Tuesday.

401
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:02,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

402
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,801
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Dark Knight says, huge fine.

403
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:07,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, what do you think, Loki?

404
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:08,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Toys R Us would get a fine over this?

405
00:25:08,823 --> 00:25:09,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

406
00:25:09,823 --> 00:25:19,148
[SPEAKER_01]: What they'll do is, I don't think it's Toys R Us, you know, store, like it's not chain wide, it's just, I think it was one or two stores in Jersey that were doing it.

407
00:25:19,308 --> 00:25:20,368
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple sloppy managers.

408
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:28,672
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, you know, it's some idiot, and what they'll do is they'll try to track it down based on the receipts and stuff, and, you know, someone will get in trouble there, and that's about it.

409
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,494
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as long as it's not, you know, corporate wide or something, they're

410
00:25:32,974 --> 00:25:34,195
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be a huge deal.

411
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:37,396
[SPEAKER_01]: They may just get their next game or whatever shipped to them.

412
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:39,957
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't get it before street date.

413
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:42,338
[SPEAKER_02]: A little slap on the wrist.

414
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:43,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Naughty, naughty.

415
00:25:44,058 --> 00:25:44,538
[SPEAKER_02]: No cookie.

416
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because there's Target and shit.

417
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Target and Walmart are horrible.

418
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Toys R Us is usually the biggest offender when it comes to breaking street date.

419
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:53,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny you guys say that.

420
00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:57,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Son of Dad says, for once, it's not Target breaking massive street dates.

421
00:25:57,963 --> 00:26:00,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Joshi16 says, I would laugh if OLR got a free Madden.

422
00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:01,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you know what?

423
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:10,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, send me one, because... I would laugh if we did too, because EA's pretty... Why not give it a fair shot, and give the game a fair shot?

424
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:12,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to hold a grudge against it just because it's a sports game.

425
00:26:12,785 --> 00:26:14,145
[SPEAKER_02]: It deserves a fair shot just like any other game.

426
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:15,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm not saying it's a horrible game either.

427
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:17,767
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying I don't care for sports games.

428
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:18,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Any sports games.

429
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:20,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, anyway, moving on.

430
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:29,113
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you don't have your hands on Bioshock yet, you still can get your hands on the art book, which is free to download from Irrational Games.

431
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:29,994
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um...

432
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:32,839
[SPEAKER_01]: BioShock Breaking the Mold Artbooks are great

433
00:26:55,538 --> 00:27:12,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, speaking, though, of computer-y stuff, you know, they were saying, well, at least IGN PC reviewed PC Bioshock as much better than the Xbox 360 version, saying that it handled better, the interface was better by using the mouse and the keyboard, which, if you're playing a first-person shooter, hi, duh.

434
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:14,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now, wait a minute.

435
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:14,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Except, except, except.

436
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:16,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, it's personal preferences, I think.

437
00:27:16,724 --> 00:27:19,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, here's the classic debate, keyboard and mouse versus analog sticks.

438
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:20,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

439
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:30,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Depending on how the game was supposed to be played, the functionality of the game itself... Like, okay, what would you rather play Doom on?

440
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,592
[SPEAKER_04]: PC or...

441
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:46,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I read their review on Bioshock, and their thing was, they're saying, you know, for example, switching your special abilities using the right mouse button instead of the left bumper on the 360.

442
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:49,616
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I don't have trouble hitting the left bumper on the 360.

443
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:51,416
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hard.

444
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:53,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't get it.

445
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:55,637
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just nitpicking shit, is what it is.

446
00:27:55,897 --> 00:28:00,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also saying the hacking's a little bit easier because you can use the mouse instead of having to use the analog stick.

447
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:00,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, mine...

448
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:02,793
[SPEAKER_01]: minor shit.

449
00:28:02,873 --> 00:28:03,494
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it is.

450
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:07,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they were also pointing out, though, that you could run it at 1920x1200.

451
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:09,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure you can do it.

452
00:28:09,817 --> 00:28:10,657
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a PC, hi.

453
00:28:10,837 --> 00:28:12,678
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an Uber computer that's fast enough.

454
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:15,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet if I tried to run it at that resolution, it wouldn't be smooth.

455
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:16,420
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other problem.

456
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but that's, you know, PC gaming in general.

457
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:22,922
[SPEAKER_02]: You usually have to have, like, the most top-end system to play most of the newer games.

458
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:23,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all.

459
00:28:23,583 --> 00:28:26,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, games like World of Warcraft can run on pretty old machines, but, you know.

460
00:28:27,825 --> 00:28:30,466
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's meant to be available to a high audience.

461
00:28:32,786 --> 00:28:44,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd try it out on PC I don't know though I'm so used to those type of games now with the analogs I don't know but yeah like Quake 3 I couldn't not play that on a PC like you know there's just some games you really get used to

462
00:28:44,947 --> 00:28:48,089
[SPEAKER_02]: and if we want to go the other way around, Final Fantasy XI.

463
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:50,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, we did have that issue, didn't we?

464
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:53,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Final Fantasy XI was made for a console.

465
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:55,253
[SPEAKER_02]: It was made for the PlayStation 2, ported to the PC.

466
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:58,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't fucking play that game with a controller for shit.

467
00:28:58,796 --> 00:29:00,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to have the keyboard to play that game.

468
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:03,599
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had absolutely no problem playing it with a controller.

469
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I started off with that crappy little Gravis pad I got for $10 from Dan's GameStop back in the day.

470
00:29:10,743 --> 00:29:13,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was doing all my macros and crap with my trigger buttons.

471
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:15,386
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

472
00:29:15,426 --> 00:29:16,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Your wiring is backwards, I think.

473
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:17,788
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

474
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:21,931
[SPEAKER_02]: The games you're supposed to play with a controller, you like to play with keyboard and mouse.

475
00:29:21,951 --> 00:29:24,112
[SPEAKER_02]: The games you're supposed to play with keyboard and mouse, you like with controller.

476
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:24,812
[SPEAKER_02]: You're backwards.

477
00:29:25,353 --> 00:29:25,553
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not.

478
00:29:25,573 --> 00:29:26,033
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.

479
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:26,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you are.

480
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:33,498
[SPEAKER_04]: That, and you know, it's kind of hard to play Doom without a keyboard because of, you know, IDDQD and IDBFG and all that.

481
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:34,539
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

482
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:47,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let's see, looking at, uh, chat room for comments, uh, chat.orangelandradio.com Sephiroth1215 says, uh, FPS games are usually done in the USA, and US companies love to have the best graphics possible, and that's not possible on Wii.

483
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:54,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start a little debate there about, I'm sure Metroid Prime 3 is coming into the mix as well now, because that game's out, what, next week as well?

484
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Or no, two weeks?

485
00:29:56,157 --> 00:29:56,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Two weeks.

486
00:29:56,457 --> 00:29:57,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

487
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:58,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, let's see.

488
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,900
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is there here?

489
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:01,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

490
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess Dark Tetsuya maybe talked about that.

491
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:09,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they'd make Red Steel 2, even though they have so much room for improvement.

492
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of room for improvement.

493
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:13,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

494
00:30:14,491 --> 00:30:18,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, RawSteelUT says it probably costs three times as much to get a system that'll run Bioshock.

495
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:20,155
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE

496
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:51,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Every month following the launch.

497
00:30:52,047 --> 00:30:57,229
[SPEAKER_02]: So, kind of not surprising when you consider that Microsoft's been trying to bridge the gap between the console and the PC.

498
00:30:57,329 --> 00:30:58,390
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

499
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'd buy a lot of these for PC.

500
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:05,473
[SPEAKER_02]: But my question is, if I bought it on live, would I get to download it for free on the PC?

501
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:06,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I should.

502
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:08,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you should, too.

503
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:09,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I'm cheap.

504
00:31:10,595 --> 00:31:17,478
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing, too, I'm wondering, is it's going to be a little bit of a harder sell to sell some of these PopCab games that are free online.

505
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:19,539
[SPEAKER_01]: on the PC.

506
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but even PopCap charges extra money for a downloadable version with more features.

507
00:31:25,444 --> 00:31:26,384
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where they make their money.

508
00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:34,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Because whenever you play one of those games online, they're always saying, download the trial version of the Uber version of this game with more levels and more colors.

509
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

510
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:36,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that.

511
00:31:37,352 --> 00:31:43,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what's also interesting about the whole thing is that the 150 megabyte size limit still applies, even to the PC games.

512
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:44,197
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of interesting to me.

513
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:44,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

514
00:31:44,877 --> 00:31:45,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Well... I don't know.

515
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:47,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways...

516
00:31:49,295 --> 00:31:56,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, well, actually the 150 meg limit, maybe that does tie into something that they're going to be able to be transferred back and forth or something.

517
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:56,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

518
00:31:57,238 --> 00:31:57,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope so.

519
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe later on or something.

520
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:00,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.

521
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:14,104
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and this is not a big surprise, but apparently the news got out that, um, Xbox or Microsoft, I should say, is allowing certain MMOs to require, um, hard drive space, um,

522
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,163
[SPEAKER_01]: and require the use of the Xbox 360 hard drive.

523
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Duh, I mean, Final Fantasy XI, hello, I mean.

524
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:29,452
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently what they're saying is that each title will create a master storage file, one file per title per console or something like that.

525
00:32:30,312 --> 00:32:35,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently on the box it will say, you know, such and such storage is required.

526
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:36,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though XI didn't say that, did it?

527
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:38,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess it had to have said it somewhere.

528
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,961
[SPEAKER_01]: It must have because you had to install it to your hard drive, so.

529
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:43,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

530
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:45,058
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not surprised that MMOs require this.

531
00:32:45,218 --> 00:32:48,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just surprised that normal games haven't gotten this yet.

532
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,662
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think that that is coming, whether they're saying it or not.

533
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:57,364
[SPEAKER_02]: The most shocking thing about that story to me, I was like, there's MMOs in development for the 360?

534
00:32:57,404 --> 00:32:57,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

535
00:32:59,713 --> 00:33:02,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there that Marvel MMO or something that was coming out to them?

536
00:33:03,035 --> 00:33:03,795
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

537
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:04,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play that.

538
00:33:04,455 --> 00:33:05,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember that.

539
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:06,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what MMOs are in development for 360?

540
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just totally spacing it.

541
00:33:09,497 --> 00:33:11,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've heard of something, but I can't remember.

542
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:14,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what is in development for 360 that's an MMO?

543
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

544
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,601
[SPEAKER_02]: People... Do they still play Phantasy Star Universe?

545
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, World of Warcraft.

546
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:19,722
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be true.

547
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:20,983
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft is coming to 360.

548
00:33:21,063 --> 00:33:21,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shut up!

549
00:33:21,343 --> 00:33:23,744
[SPEAKER_01]: World of Warcraft is never coming to 360.

550
00:33:23,844 --> 00:33:25,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave it on the damn PC.

551
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:26,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragnarok 2.

552
00:33:27,435 --> 00:33:28,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that would be sweet.

553
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:31,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to have a Korean social security number, apparently.

554
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:33,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucks.

555
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:37,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, there's ways of getting around it, but I've been trying to play the Ragnarok 2 demo.

556
00:33:37,902 --> 00:33:39,683
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to kidnap a Korean child.

557
00:33:40,743 --> 00:33:41,724
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other ways to do that.

558
00:33:41,744 --> 00:33:42,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want a Korean child.

559
00:33:43,465 --> 00:33:44,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, DJ Dark Knight has a good point.

560
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:47,248
[SPEAKER_02]: A fancy star universe is also another MMO on the 360.

561
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:48,368
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I just said.

562
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:55,133
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the add-on comes out this fall for it, if people are still playing that game.

563
00:33:55,153 --> 00:33:55,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess who quit?

564
00:33:57,253 --> 00:33:58,914
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says find at

565
00:34:28,325 --> 00:34:29,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear about the baby this week?

566
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:30,365
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not in Korea.

567
00:34:30,385 --> 00:34:30,986
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was China.

568
00:34:31,026 --> 00:34:31,666
[SPEAKER_04]: That's China.

569
00:34:32,326 --> 00:34:33,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your countries right.

570
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:34,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your Asia right, Dark Tetsuya.

571
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:35,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Shame.

572
00:34:35,327 --> 00:34:36,747
[SPEAKER_04]: God, really?

573
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:37,787
[SPEAKER_02]: That was still kind of funny.

574
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:38,747
[SPEAKER_02]: A little funny.

575
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it was wrong, it was funny.

576
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:40,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

577
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:41,568
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

578
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:44,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Read the news, people.

579
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Go on Yahoo.

580
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:51,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of reading about celebrities and Paris Hilton's stupid ass, read World News.

581
00:34:51,731 --> 00:34:53,351
[SPEAKER_02]: But what if I like to read about celebrities?

582
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:53,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like...

583
00:34:54,602 --> 00:34:55,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Perez Hilton is like in my day.

584
00:34:56,203 --> 00:35:01,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I always visit, okay, you gotta visit Kotaku and Destructoid and Joystick and Perez Hilton.

585
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,286
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically how I, you know.

586
00:35:03,806 --> 00:35:04,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

587
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:06,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Surf the net every day.

588
00:35:07,088 --> 00:35:13,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I go to Yahoo News and then I go to CNN.com and then I read my live journal.

589
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:14,511
[SPEAKER_02]: No one cares about a browsing habit.

590
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:15,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the next story.

591
00:35:16,012 --> 00:35:16,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I go to PornoTube.

592
00:35:17,713 --> 00:35:22,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, while Steel UT apparently needs an explanation, some people in China wanted to name their child at...

593
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:24,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

594
00:35:43,106 --> 00:35:45,487
[SPEAKER_04]: My Chemical Romance is going to be in Guitar Hero 3.

595
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:48,748
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing a three-pack.

596
00:35:48,948 --> 00:35:52,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, not Guitar Hero 3, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360.

597
00:35:52,649 --> 00:36:04,252
[SPEAKER_04]: They are doing a three-song pack for Xbox Live Marketplace that will have teenagers' famous last words, and this is how I disappear.

598
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:08,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It is 500 points, a.k.a.

599
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:08,493
$6.25.

600
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe it's actually up now.

601
00:36:11,014 --> 00:36:12,514
[SPEAKER_04]: They're master tracks, by the way, from the band.

602
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe we have a little clip of those songs.

603
00:36:16,402 --> 00:36:24,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So, cause, like, well, you know, cause, because, like, I have no idea who my, well, I know who they are, but I don't really listen to these type of bands.

604
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:25,349
[SPEAKER_04]: They did one song that I like.

605
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.

606
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,491
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Cemetery Drive.

607
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:28,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I knew none of these songs.

608
00:36:29,392 --> 00:36:30,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Play something, Rob.

609
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:31,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's do it.

610
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:35,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Say, now, I'm straight as a star.

611
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:37,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't leave no shit out of me.

612
00:36:37,658 --> 00:36:38,799
Make you care less, that's wrong.

613
00:37:04,361 --> 00:37:08,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, the chatroom is all going, no, no, don't play that, why did you do that, why?

614
00:37:10,151 --> 00:37:13,792
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sephiroth1215, though, says, Hey, I hate emo, but the Black Parade is very good.

615
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:14,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

616
00:37:14,493 --> 00:37:16,674
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the songs were kind of melodic.

617
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:18,154
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem to fit in Guitar Hero 2.

618
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:24,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't get into the whole emo versus punk versus whatever else.

619
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:24,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

620
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:29,498
[SPEAKER_01]: At least you got some new fucking tracks to download for Guitar Hero 2 that are not Guitar Hero 1.

621
00:37:29,558 --> 00:37:29,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.

622
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:30,679
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

623
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:34,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't we all agree that that's a good thing, even if you don't like the particular band they picked?

624
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,120
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

625
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:36,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

626
00:37:37,543 --> 00:37:42,824
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, speaking of Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 3 is going to be getting Slash.

627
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:47,905
[SPEAKER_02]: You already knew about that, but they're also going to be having Bret Michaels, if you can believe it.

628
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:52,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Bret Michaels is going to be using his face and his image in the game, just like Slash.

629
00:37:52,946 --> 00:38:01,308
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, in the game, you've got to get some Poison songs, Talk Dirty to Me by Poison, and go that far from the Bret Michaels band.

630
00:38:01,808 --> 00:38:02,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty cool.

631
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:04,489
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look forward to those songs in Guitar Hero 3.

632
00:38:05,473 --> 00:38:08,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, we do not have clips of those songs because I was too lazy to prearrange that before the show.

633
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:12,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, way to go, Rob.

634
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:13,037
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad.

635
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:22,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, if you happen to be living in Australia, you'll be happy to know that the 360 Core has now been price dropped to compete with the Wii.

636
00:38:23,063 --> 00:38:24,584
[SPEAKER_01]: It is now the same price as the Wii.

637
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:32,448
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, coinciding with that, the 20 gig system has also been dropped down to...

638
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:38,045
[SPEAKER_01]: $579.95 Australian.

639
00:38:40,245 --> 00:38:41,646
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty awesome as well.

640
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:44,427
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

641
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:49,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Dropping the core system down to where the Wii is, not good enough I still think.

642
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

643
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's interesting precedent.

644
00:38:54,911 --> 00:39:01,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if that's going to happen over here eventually where the 360 will get cut back enough where it can compete with the Wii like that.

645
00:39:02,686 --> 00:39:08,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's also a matter of the markets themselves that want to make it competitive for the market it's in.

646
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:14,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just that Nintendo kind of likes to screw the people that aren't in Japan or the U.S.

647
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,191
[SPEAKER_02]: by charging more for their systems?

648
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:19,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, doesn't the DS and the Wii cost way more?

649
00:39:19,992 --> 00:39:23,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess most systems cost way more in Europe and Australia, Canada.

650
00:39:24,933 --> 00:39:25,953
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

651
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:55,234
[SPEAKER_02]: But it still creates an interesting choice when they are the same price in that currency, the Wii and the 360.

652
00:39:55,574 --> 00:39:58,957
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a different competition than it is here in that regard.

653
00:39:59,157 --> 00:40:13,768
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, if you want to argue it, I guess, that you would need to still buy a memory card in order to be able to save your games and stuff versus the Wii, which has built-in memory, although it is extremely limited.

654
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:16,794
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

655
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:58,094
[SPEAKER_04]: for anyone who has been keeping up with Sega there was a rumor going around that they were doing a Viking game called Vikings Battle of Asgard and GameStop has actually stopped listing the PS3 and Xbox 360 version of that on their forthcoming games and um

656
00:40:59,062 --> 00:41:03,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It was to be released in February 2008, but Sega's not saying anything about it.

657
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:10,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they could say something when it comes up to the convention coming up, but other than that, they're... Nuh-uh.

658
00:41:12,124 --> 00:41:12,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

659
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,225
[SPEAKER_04]: No hairy Vikings!

660
00:41:16,645 --> 00:41:17,345
[SPEAKER_02]: No fjords!

661
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:20,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't there an old-school PC game called Vikings or something like that?

662
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:23,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what was... I think it was something else.

663
00:41:23,526 --> 00:41:24,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Lost Vikings or something?

664
00:41:24,927 --> 00:41:25,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Lost Vikings.

665
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:26,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what it was?

666
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they also had a version of Super Nintendo, didn't they?

667
00:41:42,406 --> 00:41:43,566
[SPEAKER_02]: They're porting it, yeah.

668
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:45,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Crazy Frog Racer already out on PC or something?

669
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:46,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the UK.

670
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:48,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my lord.

671
00:41:48,448 --> 00:41:52,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy Frog is like one of those franchises that really needs to go away.

672
00:41:52,709 --> 00:42:03,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anyway, look, folks, it's Graffiti is the company that's working on it, and the CEO of Graffiti, Kenneth Hurley, actually said this at a recent announcement.

673
00:42:03,212 --> 00:42:09,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote, we are excited to jump in on the Xbox 360 and introduce our title to the millions of gamers around the world playing on the console.

674
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,754
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe no one wants to play your damn game.

675
00:42:12,421 --> 00:42:14,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything about that?

676
00:42:14,722 --> 00:42:17,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, the soundtrack alone is going to make me want to put a gun to my head.

677
00:42:19,105 --> 00:42:20,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get that Crazy Frog thing at all.

678
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:23,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard the Crazy Frog songs, Jamie?

679
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:24,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

680
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:26,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Please have a clip.

681
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:27,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get a clip.

682
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:29,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I will load a clip right now.

683
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:31,571
[SPEAKER_02]: While you do the next story.

684
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the next story and I will get a clip.

685
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:39,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, you may be waiting for Beautiful Katamari to come out in October, but

686
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:40,506
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

687
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:17,980
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually play as one of the cousins in the demo as well Yay, that's kind of neat Yeah, we actually have a clip of one of the new songs from Beautiful Katamari right here

688
00:43:35,754 --> 00:43:37,995
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if my Xbox... That was Crazy Frog, by the way.

689
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:42,516
[SPEAKER_02]: If my Xbox started making those type of noises, three Red Rings of Death wouldn't be enough.

690
00:43:44,217 --> 00:43:44,977
[SPEAKER_02]: For what I would do to it.

691
00:43:45,537 --> 00:43:50,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, let's cleanse the palette a little bit away from retarded frog.

692
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:51,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

693
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Smacky the frog.

694
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

695
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,301
[SPEAKER_04]: For people who are still playing Lost Planets, guess what?

696
00:43:57,581 --> 00:43:58,381
[SPEAKER_04]: The maps are all free.

697
00:43:59,002 --> 00:43:59,762
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just go get them.

698
00:44:00,562 --> 00:44:01,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I like free.

699
00:44:02,863 --> 00:44:02,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

700
00:44:06,836 --> 00:44:07,297
[SPEAKER_04]: They're free.

701
00:44:08,377 --> 00:44:09,498
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is there to say?

702
00:44:09,678 --> 00:44:10,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Free stuff.

703
00:44:10,578 --> 00:44:11,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get it.

704
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:12,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, free.

705
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that whole concept, though, of releasing map packs in advance for money for the hardcore people and then free for the rest of us.

706
00:44:19,642 --> 00:44:24,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, according to this, you can trade in your game and rebuy it for $10 at Toys R Us.

707
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:26,365
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

708
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:27,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at what this says.

709
00:44:29,387 --> 00:44:31,748
[SPEAKER_04]: It says you can rebuy it at Toys R Us for $9.99.

710
00:44:33,044 --> 00:44:37,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Why the fuck would you trade in your game and then re-buy it for $10?

711
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:38,628
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a profit-making thing, I think.

712
00:44:38,668 --> 00:44:41,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're saying you can sell it back for more and then buy it for cheap.

713
00:44:42,231 --> 00:44:43,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a money-making scheme.

714
00:44:43,712 --> 00:44:44,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

715
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:47,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's with Madden.

716
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:49,196
[SPEAKER_01]: What it is is the game is like $20 right now.

717
00:44:50,296 --> 00:44:53,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Joshi16 says Crazy Frog Frogger would be good.

718
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:53,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Kill him.

719
00:44:54,379 --> 00:44:59,503
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually have Crazy Frog Racing coming out on PlayStation 2 in two weeks, actually.

720
00:44:59,923 --> 00:45:00,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Kill me now.

721
00:45:01,511 --> 00:45:03,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it'll coincide with the Xbox 360 game.

722
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, have you ever heard shittier music in your life?

723
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:23,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really?

724
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:27,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, does this make you want to go and, like, willingly listen to Britney Spears?

725
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me want to go on a car trip with you.

726
00:45:32,182 --> 00:45:37,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I've heard some of the stuff you play in your car.

727
00:45:37,724 --> 00:45:41,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree with some of it.

728
00:45:43,105 --> 00:45:44,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's change the subject.

729
00:45:46,126 --> 00:45:48,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Our chat room's in pain, and I'm sure many of you are too.

730
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:50,187
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about release dates.

731
00:45:50,227 --> 00:45:53,868
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always a happy subject that will wake us back up and get us all happy again.

732
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:54,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Shari Takoran

733
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:28,609
[SPEAKER_02]: which looks to be some type of game where I don't know it looks like it's another it's by Compile Heart and this you know of course anime looking chick is offering up these little octopus looking cute things I don't really know how else to describe it it's a puzzle game though Tentacle Rape?

734
00:46:29,056 --> 00:46:29,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Suku Suku in Fuku 2

735
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:53,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Motosukusuku is coming out.

736
00:46:53,707 --> 00:46:55,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up, that's what it's called.

737
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, are there girls in like Suku Suku uniforms there?

738
00:47:00,353 --> 00:47:04,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I like, check out this screenshot from PureXCure, Loki.

739
00:47:04,756 --> 00:47:07,819
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like she wants a Suku Suku in the Ufuku.

740
00:47:13,524 --> 00:47:19,008
[SPEAKER_02]: She's showing a little bit of skirt there, hiking up a little bit.

741
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:19,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

742
00:47:19,909 --> 00:47:19,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

743
00:47:20,427 --> 00:47:22,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck PurexCure, I don't care about that.

744
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see what this Suku Suku thing is here.

745
00:47:24,749 --> 00:47:25,949
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a quiz game, though!

746
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Quiz and variety.

747
00:47:29,611 --> 00:47:32,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's these cute little chibi bunny things.

748
00:47:33,092 --> 00:47:36,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are dressed as a knight, and some are dressed as little farms guys.

749
00:47:36,134 --> 00:47:38,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's Suku and that's Fuku, I don't know.

750
00:47:41,476 --> 00:47:44,217
[SPEAKER_04]: They're more descriptive terms, because Motto is more...

751
00:47:45,258 --> 00:48:02,531
[SPEAKER_02]: also coming out on the Nintendo DS Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fates and I'm sure a lot of you guys like your Crystal Chronicles so there you go, you have that to look forward to and that's probably the biggest game this week that and Suku Suku awesome anyways, let's see

752
00:48:03,135 --> 00:48:04,016
[SPEAKER_01]: in the U.S.

753
00:48:04,396 --> 00:48:06,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's some pretty good stuff to look forward to this week.

754
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:14,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just a little game called Bioshock on, um, PlayStation 2, or, not PlayStation 2, 360 and PC.

755
00:48:14,322 --> 00:48:17,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant PC for some reason I was looking at a PlayStation 2 game.

756
00:48:17,484 --> 00:48:19,766
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG, Bioshock's coming to PlayStation 3 after all.

757
00:48:19,866 --> 00:48:20,646
[SPEAKER_01]: OMG, OMG.

758
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:21,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, no.

759
00:48:21,907 --> 00:48:22,968
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not coming to PlayStation 2.

760
00:48:23,508 --> 00:48:25,549
[SPEAKER_01]: PlayStation 2 would melt down if they had to play that game.

761
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:26,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

762
00:48:27,819 --> 00:48:35,101
[SPEAKER_01]: On PlayStation 2, though, you can look forward to two wonderful games, including Metropolis Mania 2 and Brunswick Bowling.

763
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:37,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

764
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:38,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray.

765
00:48:38,442 --> 00:48:45,043
[SPEAKER_01]: On PS3 and PSP, you're going to be getting Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, the delayed edition.

766
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:48,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, let's see, also...

767
00:48:49,728 --> 00:49:00,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here, on PC and 360 as well, another good RPG, Two Worlds, coming out on both platforms, as well as the Two Worlds Collector's Edition.

768
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:12,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see, on PSP, a couple more games, Jeanne d'Arc and Dragon Ears Aria is also making its way up.

769
00:49:14,825 --> 00:49:37,865
[SPEAKER_01]: On the Wii, a whole bunch of nothing And of course on the DS, Brain Age 2, more brain training in minutes a day Another game that you'll play for one whole day and then stop playing And this one was really interesting, The Settlers is coming out on DS as well Which isn't that Settlers of Catan, I think?

770
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:39,226
[SPEAKER_01]: The Settlers?

771
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:40,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds familiar

772
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

773
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,961
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to look at that.

774
00:49:43,161 --> 00:49:44,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Operation Vietnam.

775
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:48,823
[SPEAKER_01]: So you too can have the flashbacks that everybody is jealous of.

776
00:49:49,883 --> 00:49:50,763
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

777
00:49:51,884 --> 00:50:00,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quick before we get to the Europe dates, I just want to say in chat, Darvoid says that Sukufuku translates to summer uniform, despite what you were thinking, sicko.

778
00:50:00,566 --> 00:50:02,087
[SPEAKER_02]: That does look like a summer uniform.

779
00:50:02,107 --> 00:50:02,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Summer is not too.

780
00:50:03,987 --> 00:50:04,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whatever.

781
00:50:05,108 --> 00:50:05,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just move on.

782
00:50:05,928 --> 00:50:06,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

783
00:50:08,618 --> 00:50:12,123
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 21st, we have Dragoneer's Aria on PSP.

784
00:50:12,323 --> 00:50:16,008
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 24th, we have Anno 1701 for the DS.

785
00:50:16,529 --> 00:50:18,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue Dragon on Xbox 360.

786
00:50:18,711 --> 00:50:20,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Glory Days 2, Brotherhood of Men on DS.

787
00:50:21,155 --> 00:50:22,617
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Loki on PC.

788
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,679
[SPEAKER_04]: A bunch of Madden.

789
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:25,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Madden.

790
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:40,754
[SPEAKER_04]: MotoGP07 Sucks It's the husband No, I detest American football It's stupid Play rugby Is Loki coming to Mac?

791
00:50:41,314 --> 00:50:49,537
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's PC That's right, Loki does not come to Mac I knew that was coming Can I continue?

792
00:50:49,577 --> 00:50:54,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you may Thank you, sir On the 24th we have Pac-Man Rally

793
00:50:55,180 --> 00:51:01,004
[SPEAKER_04]: 24th also is Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 for PS3 and PSP.

794
00:51:01,844 --> 00:51:03,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And 24th is Bioshock.

795
00:51:05,306 --> 00:51:05,947
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Bioshock.

796
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:08,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to hate that too?

797
00:51:08,628 --> 00:51:08,809
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

798
00:51:08,989 --> 00:51:11,490
[SPEAKER_04]: If they did a PS2 version, you'd think it'd be like BioFizz.

799
00:51:13,351 --> 00:51:13,992
[SPEAKER_04]: BioZap.

800
00:51:15,513 --> 00:51:15,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

801
00:51:17,379 --> 00:51:19,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope Mr. Bubbles gets a spin-off game.

802
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,500
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I hope for.

803
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,781
[SPEAKER_01]: He should have his own Saturday morning cartoon show.

804
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Bubbles Happy Hour!

805
00:51:27,202 --> 00:51:30,003
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be a fighting game, Mr. Bubbles vs. Pyramid Head.

806
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:31,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Pyramid Head would win.

807
00:51:31,683 --> 00:51:32,943
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be hardcore.

808
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:33,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Pyramid Head.

809
00:51:34,004 --> 00:51:36,765
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to do, like, scary games of the fighter.

810
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:42,486
[SPEAKER_01]: In a fight, though, between Mr. Bubbles, or, you know, the Big Daddy and Pyramid Head.

811
00:51:42,786 --> 00:51:45,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Bubbles, Pyramid Head, and the Liquor.

812
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:55,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I would say, though, I think that, you know, seeing the demo, how fast those, you know, big daddies move, and Pyramid Head's just dragging that shit along.

813
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:56,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's kind of slow.

814
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:59,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but the only way you can kill Pyramid Head is for him to kill himself.

815
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,209
[SPEAKER_04]: P-Hitty P-Hitty P-Hitty

816
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,133
[SPEAKER_02]: It's P. Hetty.

817
00:52:25,414 --> 00:52:27,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was OLR versus AGI, right?

818
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:33,697
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be, like, you, me, and Loki are all playable characters, and Scott, Mary Young, and Jessica are all playable characters.

819
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:39,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Then maybe, like, Bobby B for good measure, and we could put one of our people, like, Travis Donovan or DMN or somebody can be a playable character.

820
00:52:40,539 --> 00:52:41,219
[SPEAKER_02]: And then P. Hetty.

821
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just random.

822
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,320
[SPEAKER_03]: It just shows up.

823
00:52:45,141 --> 00:52:45,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Random boss.

824
00:52:46,001 --> 00:52:47,121
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd be, like, Noob Saibot.

825
00:52:48,422 --> 00:52:50,442
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd be Smoke.

826
00:52:51,103 --> 00:52:51,643
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, uh...

827
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:53,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

828
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:57,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Chat room is very random here.

829
00:52:58,151 --> 00:53:04,314
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 says, I want DarkSakura the game, which would more or less be Burnout OLR Edition.

830
00:53:05,814 --> 00:53:06,895
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know how right you are.

831
00:53:07,675 --> 00:53:09,476
[SPEAKER_02]: You just totally see her driving down the freeway.

832
00:53:10,316 --> 00:53:11,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else is there.

833
00:53:11,117 --> 00:53:13,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Joshi16 says, Bioshock on the Atari 2600.

834
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:16,399
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be interesting.

835
00:53:16,803 --> 00:53:17,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipeout HD

836
00:53:42,243 --> 00:53:43,624
[SPEAKER_02]: It was already formally announced.

837
00:53:43,664 --> 00:53:44,665
[SPEAKER_02]: We know the game is coming.

838
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:49,929
[SPEAKER_02]: It was already said that it was coming at E3 2007, and it's supposed to be released before the end of the year.

839
00:53:50,649 --> 00:53:53,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipeout HD, of course, will have high def.

840
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:54,992
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Wipeout for the PlayStation 3.

841
00:53:55,212 --> 00:53:55,933
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do you need to know?

842
00:53:56,133 --> 00:54:01,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't they just release a demo on the PlayStation Network since there's hardly any demos on there in the first place?

843
00:54:02,137 --> 00:54:12,682
[SPEAKER_02]: because people are really critical of demos and stuff and they probably want to make sure that, you know, because even though I said earlier I wasn't going to base my full opinion of a game off a demo, there's a lot of people that will.

844
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:13,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not perfect either.

845
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:14,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done it before.

846
00:54:14,903 --> 00:54:18,625
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.

847
00:54:19,345 --> 00:54:24,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Another interesting thing, apparently calling all cars is going to be transferable to the PSP.

848
00:54:25,308 --> 00:54:26,228
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's the rumor.

849
00:54:26,248 --> 00:54:27,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

850
00:54:28,254 --> 00:54:33,158
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is coming from a European magazine, PSP, the official guidebook.

851
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:41,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And no word on if that's even true or not, but it would be interesting.

852
00:54:42,184 --> 00:54:42,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

853
00:54:43,665 --> 00:54:47,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe sell some more copies on PSP that way.

854
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:50,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

855
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:52,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Is anyone interested in this game?

856
00:54:52,632 --> 00:54:53,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I looked at it and I was like, eh.

857
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:55,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what you're talking about.

858
00:54:55,854 --> 00:54:56,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been ignoring it.

859
00:54:58,894 --> 00:54:59,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty then.

860
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:04,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like, is it supposed to be exciting?

861
00:55:05,598 --> 00:55:10,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, the game itself, you know, basically is kind of a cops and robbers type thing.

862
00:55:10,662 --> 00:55:13,463
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all done, you know, cartoony, cel-shaded and stuff.

863
00:55:14,664 --> 00:55:16,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, wasn't that, wasn't actually that an old show?

864
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:17,066
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

865
00:55:17,786 --> 00:55:19,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that was Car 54, Where Are You?

866
00:55:19,848 --> 00:55:20,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

867
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:24,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was a show called Calling All Cars, but I think it has nothing to do with this, actually.

868
00:55:25,251 --> 00:55:25,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

869
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:27,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, I, I've,

870
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:32,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the fact that it's transferable.

871
00:55:32,948 --> 00:55:34,208
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of a neat feature.

872
00:55:34,268 --> 00:55:39,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's something that Xbox Live is never going to be able to really deliver because there is no portable Microsoft system yet.

873
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:41,571
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's kind of neat.

874
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:42,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

875
00:55:42,291 --> 00:55:42,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait.

876
00:55:43,243 --> 00:55:55,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for anybody else, though, who's interested in anything Sony has going on, there are going to be... They've actually got some dates released from 3 Speech for UK.

877
00:55:55,474 --> 00:56:05,724
[SPEAKER_04]: First coming out is Warhawk on the 28th of August on PSN, and 21st September release for Blu-ray.

878
00:56:07,065 --> 00:56:07,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And also...

879
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,339
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to cost £19.99 at €29.

880
00:56:10,459 --> 00:56:28,104
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be, let's see, there will be extra video content, a manual, and a Bluetooth headset if you pay the £39.99 to get it on the Blu-ray hard copy.

881
00:56:31,727 --> 00:56:42,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavenly Sword is going to be rumored as the 14th of September with Folklore and Lair on 12th and 26th October, of course, respective.

882
00:56:43,373 --> 00:56:48,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's nothing really yet said about SingStar for PS3.

883
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:51,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you guys be getting Lair at your house, Jamie?

884
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:53,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I really want to see that game.

885
00:56:54,315 --> 00:56:55,435
[SPEAKER_04]: We could get it.

886
00:56:55,635 --> 00:56:57,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we can rent whatever we want to.

887
00:56:57,696 --> 00:56:58,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cool.

888
00:56:58,296 --> 00:57:07,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm kind of, you know, I still haven't bought a PlayStation 3, but there are certain games I really would like to see that, you know, may change my opinion on PlayStation 3 and finally get one, and that's one of them.

889
00:57:07,278 --> 00:57:09,359
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember if I have Lair on order or not.

890
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:12,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm getting, I know I'm getting Heavenly Sword.

891
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:13,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that too.

892
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of Destruction.

893
00:57:17,081 --> 00:57:19,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I think by Christmas I'll have finally caved and buy a PlayStation 3.

894
00:57:20,742 --> 00:57:21,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.

895
00:57:21,642 --> 00:57:21,942
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

896
00:57:22,808 --> 00:57:24,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Longer you wait, the better a deal you're going to get.

897
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:25,152
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

898
00:57:25,312 --> 00:57:26,294
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to hold out.

899
00:57:26,795 --> 00:57:29,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also the fact that I just don't have a lot of money right now.

900
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And just remember, all the good games you're looking forward to aren't coming out until next spring at least.

901
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:35,870
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

902
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:36,330
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

903
00:57:36,591 --> 00:57:37,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I'll hold up.

904
00:57:39,919 --> 00:57:47,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, moving on, let's talk about free, because if I can't buy new consoles, then I'm going to get free stuff, because I like free stuff.

905
00:57:47,661 --> 00:57:49,722
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that's now free is ArcLord.

906
00:57:50,642 --> 00:57:58,904
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are an MMO fan, hopefully you've heard of this game, but if you haven't, Codemasters Online Gaming has made its online RPG, ArcLord.

907
00:57:59,244 --> 00:58:00,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely free to play.

908
00:58:01,325 --> 00:58:04,026
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an all-new expansion also available for download.

909
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:17,470
[SPEAKER_02]: The director of marketing at COG noted, quote, Since its release, Arc Lord has grown consistently, and we are excited to throw open the doors to players across North America and Europe looking to play a premium, 100% free MMORPG.

910
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:19,071
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be a catch.

911
00:58:19,611 --> 00:58:20,171
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the catch?

912
00:58:21,572 --> 00:58:22,332
[SPEAKER_02]: There must be a catch.

913
00:58:22,952 --> 00:58:23,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.

914
00:58:23,532 --> 00:58:24,213
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's playing it.

915
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:25,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there ads or something?

916
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:28,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, I'm looking at the official website here.

917
00:58:29,436 --> 00:58:31,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero Fees, download the free game now.

918
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:32,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I might check it out just for shits and giggles.

919
00:58:33,558 --> 00:58:38,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was... Someone said that that was Overlord based off that game, and I don't think so, but... Possibly.

920
00:58:38,739 --> 00:58:40,140
[SPEAKER_01]: The name sounds familiar.

921
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does have a very similarish name.

922
00:58:44,101 --> 00:58:46,962
[SPEAKER_02]: RossDLUT says, next week, ArcLord closes down.

923
00:58:47,742 --> 00:58:48,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy it while it lasts.

924
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:54,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, speaking of enjoying it while it lasts, yes, you may...

925
00:58:55,109 --> 00:59:02,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Be familiar with a wonderful spin-off into the porno world called World of Warcraft.

926
00:59:02,712 --> 00:59:03,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?

927
00:59:03,592 --> 00:59:10,635
[SPEAKER_01]: They've decided to move off of World of Warcraft and move into the ever-expanding realm of first-person shooters.

928
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:14,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they have just created FPS porn.

929
00:59:14,736 --> 00:59:17,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Operation Sex, Cock and Load.

930
00:59:19,018 --> 00:59:21,279
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the actual fucking name of this thing.

931
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,800
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a gaming-themed porn series, um,

932
00:59:25,404 --> 00:59:36,970
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, of course, based off of games like Counter-Strike, Ghost Recon, and Rainbow Six and involves a lot of people running around shooting fake guns and yelling stuff and sex.

933
00:59:38,604 --> 00:59:38,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

934
00:59:39,324 --> 00:59:41,185
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best combination ever.

935
00:59:41,485 --> 00:59:44,426
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a list list in the making we need to do next week.

936
00:59:45,046 --> 00:59:46,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Random things you should have in a porn game.

937
00:59:46,947 --> 00:59:49,068
[SPEAKER_02]: No, what video game should be turned into porn?

938
00:59:49,508 --> 00:59:49,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

939
00:59:50,108 --> 00:59:50,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Biocock.

940
00:59:51,149 --> 00:59:53,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be maybe an FPS that comes out in the future.

941
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Cocking Mama.

942
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Cocking Mama?

943
00:59:58,471 --> 01:00:00,032
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is wrong with you?

944
01:00:01,533 --> 01:00:03,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Mama will fix it, naughty boy.

945
01:00:06,715 --> 01:00:07,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I didn't say that.

946
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Attention, Internet, DarkSakura would like to see CockingMama.

947
01:00:13,622 --> 01:00:15,923
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

948
01:00:15,963 --> 01:00:16,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Not me.

949
01:00:18,305 --> 01:00:19,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking of names.

950
01:00:20,246 --> 01:00:26,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at comments in the chat room, NintendoManiac64 says, FPS, First Person Sex?

951
01:00:27,009 --> 01:00:28,290
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not First Person Sex, because...

952
01:00:28,934 --> 01:00:30,895
[SPEAKER_01]: That's POV sex, by the way.

953
01:00:30,935 --> 01:00:32,795
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole different genre.

954
01:00:32,815 --> 01:00:33,755
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stop.

955
01:00:33,795 --> 01:00:34,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stop.

956
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:44,078
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually first person where they've got the gun and everything and they're firing the gun and they're reloading it just like you would see in a first person shooter game, except they stop and have sex every now and then.

957
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:44,578
[SPEAKER_01]: They stop and reload.

958
01:00:44,598 --> 01:00:49,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you're in the middle of terrorist warfare, you have to stop and have sex.

959
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,681
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to reload.

960
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:55,081
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so mature tonight.

961
01:00:55,441 --> 01:00:57,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosteel UT sticks his head in a meat grinder.

962
01:01:00,513 --> 01:01:01,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

963
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:01,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job!

964
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:04,716
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the guy who's always ragging on us, put his head in the meat grinder.

965
01:01:04,756 --> 01:01:05,257
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

966
01:01:05,897 --> 01:01:08,219
[SPEAKER_02]: ACHP said, Cocking Mama Cock Off.

967
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Joshi16 says, Train your cock in minutes a day.

968
01:01:11,922 --> 01:01:14,564
[SPEAKER_02]: RastielUT says, Cooking Mama Bobbit.

969
01:01:15,925 --> 01:01:22,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Footy Mama Footy in Toronto says, Ninten Cats in itself is a sex game.

970
01:01:22,631 --> 01:01:23,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninten Pussy.

971
01:01:24,352 --> 01:01:25,113
[SPEAKER_02]: We are so mature.

972
01:01:26,588 --> 01:01:28,429
[SPEAKER_03]: and Tingle the RPG.

973
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:32,372
[SPEAKER_02]: This show has sunk to the level of dick and fart jokes.

974
01:01:32,412 --> 01:01:33,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations, everybody.

975
01:01:33,612 --> 01:01:34,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

976
01:01:34,473 --> 01:01:37,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you ever remember X-Man and Custer's Revenge?

977
01:01:38,155 --> 01:01:39,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I remember Custer's Revenge.

978
01:01:39,756 --> 01:01:42,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played X-Man, but I've heard you talk about it.

979
01:01:43,318 --> 01:01:43,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

980
01:01:43,738 --> 01:01:44,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

981
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,500
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's take a break.

982
01:01:47,648 --> 01:01:48,769
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a good idea, Ron.

983
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:50,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this show's getting a little crazy.

984
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:51,250
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to take a quick break.

985
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:54,492
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

986
01:01:54,852 --> 01:01:59,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

987
01:02:00,275 --> 01:02:04,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
