00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:19,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, August 12, 2007, is the Xbox 360 Core on its way out?

2
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:25,491
[SPEAKER_00]: New details on Super Mario Galaxy, and is it really possible to now play NES games on your iPhone?

3
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:37,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:42,350
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,533
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be here with you all night long as will my lovely co-host DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:48,793 --> 00:00:49,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

7
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:51,995
[SPEAKER_05]: And how are you doing, Jamie?

8
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:53,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Full of burrito.

9
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Mmm, yummy burrito.

10
00:00:54,816 --> 00:00:55,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Shrimpy burritos.

11
00:00:56,017 --> 00:00:56,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Just shrimp?

12
00:00:56,797 --> 00:00:57,858
[SPEAKER_05]: No red meat tonight?

13
00:00:58,278 --> 00:01:00,559
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not going to be eating red meat anymore.

14
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:03,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going on one of those funky diet things?

15
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:08,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, out of necessity, every so often I get to where I can't actually eat it very safely.

16
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:11,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, because I was going to say you can't have diet without dye.

17
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:12,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't diet.

18
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:14,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I have lifestyle adjustments.

19
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:15,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

20
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:17,264
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a clever little workaround.

21
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:20,284
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

22
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:23,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So would a funky diet be like pizza and disco or something?

23
00:01:23,825 --> 00:01:25,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, would that be a funky diet?

24
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:27,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be eating dirty food?

25
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:29,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, is that what your life is like right now, disco and pizza?

26
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:29,826
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

27
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:32,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, everything's all disco and pizza.

28
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:34,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever happened to discos?

29
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:37,995
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, my mom still calls clubs discos.

30
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:39,497
[SPEAKER_04]: The discotheque.

31
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing okay.

32
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I had pizza.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,901
[SPEAKER_04]: You had pizza?

34
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:44,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

35
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:45,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it good pizza?

36
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:46,066
[SPEAKER_04]: TheFunkyDiet.com

37
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:11,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because we don't have the air conditioning yet out there and it's too hot.

38
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're in the little studio.

39
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,322
[SPEAKER_05]: But the good news is we're back on the normal computers and the normal network setup and all that good stuff.

40
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:22,945
[SPEAKER_05]: So the sound of the show should be pretty much what you guys are used to, at least I hope.

41
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:27,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Save some minor echo and probably things you probably can't even really hear on your iPods.

42
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,288
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're happy to be back.

43
00:02:29,668 --> 00:02:31,169
[SPEAKER_05]: And also we're happy to have you back, Jamie.

44
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know a lot of folks were thinking about you last week, so I hope everything was okay.

45
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:36,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

46
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:37,975
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting.

47
00:02:37,995 --> 00:02:39,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, we'll leave it at that.

48
00:02:39,937 --> 00:02:41,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about games instead.

49
00:02:41,478 --> 00:02:45,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And talk about your interesting experience at California Extreme you just got back from yesterday.

50
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:47,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, at, you know, two in the morning.

51
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:49,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

52
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:51,026
[SPEAKER_05]: What exactly is California Extreme?

53
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:54,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pinball and classic gaming convention of sorts.

54
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,494
[SPEAKER_03]: They had an auction there, but as far as I know it wasn't actually part of California Extreme.

55
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:04,678
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did play a whole crap ton of games and finally beat Space Harrier.

56
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:08,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw your LJ post about beating Space Harrier, so... I sure did.

57
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:10,408
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fantastic.

58
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:12,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot that it just says the end.

59
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So, they just get a bunch of random games together and call it an expo?

60
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:19,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, some of them are for sale.

61
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:19,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

62
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:20,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's kind of cool.

63
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:23,596
[SPEAKER_03]: They had Big Bang Bar, which was the first thing I went right to.

64
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:28,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran into... Well, actually, I met up with Mel and Melody.

65
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:33,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first thing that she and I did was go right up and play...

66
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:45,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Big Bang Bar which was one of the last machines Capcom made but they only had about 16 prototypes and now there's production models of them.

67
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:52,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I should say reproduction models but the one that we played was a legitimate prototype and

68
00:03:54,244 --> 00:03:56,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it was just mostly wandering around.

69
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:57,667
[SPEAKER_03]: She was playing Star Wars.

70
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:02,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to play Ultra Pin, which was kind of interesting.

71
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:05,033
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Ultracade's answer to pinball.

72
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I think you talked about this on the show once.

73
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it like they use an LCD but laid flat instead?

74
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:11,357
[SPEAKER_05]: How does that work?

75
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:13,099
[SPEAKER_03]: It was interesting.

76
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:15,561
[SPEAKER_03]: The perspective kind of messed with my head a little bit.

77
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:19,044
[SPEAKER_03]: But I played Black Knight 2000 on it, which was pretty cool.

78
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:22,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was like, screw this and went to play a real Black Knight 2000.

79
00:04:24,585 --> 00:04:25,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Knight Pinball Pinbot

80
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:40,318
[SPEAKER_03]: or Jackbot.

81
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:41,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Cry and Sadness.

82
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have Bride of Pinbot?

83
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,440
[SPEAKER_05]: You have Bride of Pinbot in your house.

84
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:43,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Bride.

85
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:44,521
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they didn't have that.

86
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:46,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Bride of Pinbot is so badass, by the way.

87
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:49,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Vortex, which is one of the mid-80s games.

88
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:50,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I remember Vortex.

89
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:54,349
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a cool one, but I played one of the best tables ever.

90
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:55,170
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Airborne.

91
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,631
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of Capcom's.

92
00:04:57,492 --> 00:04:58,092
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all ramps.

93
00:04:58,993 --> 00:04:59,793
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all ramps.

94
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:01,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a bajillion ramps everywhere.

95
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was fun, and they had it on like a bajillion buy-ins.

96
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:06,439
[SPEAKER_03]: It was crazy.

97
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So did you play anything besides Space Harrier and Pinball?

98
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:12,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, um, Words.

99
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:13,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did.

100
00:05:13,929 --> 00:05:14,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play Journey.

101
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,030
[SPEAKER_03]: They got Journey working.

102
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,050
[SPEAKER_05]: They had Journey?

103
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

104
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:19,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, I should have gone.

105
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:22,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to go, but I couldn't because I had other stuff going on.

106
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:23,313
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did I play?

107
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:25,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what I would give to play a Journey arcade machine.

108
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:25,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Mappy.

109
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:27,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

110
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I played, Julie played a bunch of Crystal Castles.

111
00:05:30,756 --> 00:05:33,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I ran into her, she's either playing Crystal Castles or Pac-Man.

112
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:41,580
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a tapper, Rob, that someone had messed with the sprites, and it was all Simpsons characters.

113
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,521
[SPEAKER_03]: With Moe as the bartender.

114
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:46,162
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

115
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:53,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I played SVC Chaos, because I had to get my fighting game on.

116
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,225
[SPEAKER_03]: X-Men vs. Street Fighter

117
00:06:24,315 --> 00:06:26,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Panic Park

118
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:47,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Panic Park is a great game.

119
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:53,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they have one at Milpitas Golf Land where there's a big one and then there's a small one.

120
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:55,714
[SPEAKER_03]: They had an actual Japanese one there, but they had the bad Ingress-y one.

121
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:59,919
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game where one person's on one side and the other person's on another.

122
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,000
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to play with another person.

123
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,523
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a big stick and it slides around.

124
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:20,475
[SPEAKER_03]: and you are competing with somebody in minigames and it's best however many out of however many and you push them aside or they push you aside using this big stick when you're grabbing hula hoops as they come from the ground or grabbing coins or jumping from thing to thing or avoiding hammers falling on you.

125
00:07:20,535 --> 00:07:21,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never heard of this.

126
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:22,743
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fantastic.

127
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:26,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've actually played with Dan's buddy, Will.

128
00:07:26,465 --> 00:07:28,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And Will is really strong, okay?

129
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:29,846
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had a hard time.

130
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:36,569
[SPEAKER_03]: We ended up, he won two matches, I won two matches, and we had a draw of three matches.

131
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually had a perfect draw game.

132
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:44,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to read some comments from chat because, you know, your comments on old gaming is sparking a lot of discussion in chat.

133
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:48,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, since I haven't introduced them yet, say hello to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

134
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,410
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see.

135
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,352
[SPEAKER_05]: We have GS68 says, I was at Milpitas Golf Land on Thursday.

136
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember seeing a game like that.

137
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe it wasn't there.

138
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:55,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it was at Sunnyvale or something.

139
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:58,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Kevin DDR says, Oh, my God, Panic Park.

140
00:07:58,296 --> 00:07:58,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, yeah.

141
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:00,497
[SPEAKER_05]: So somebody knows what you're talking about there.

142
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Sakura Max says, He's confused.

143
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,800
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the youngest guy, so he doesn't know about these old-ass games.

144
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's time to learn.

145
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:08,036
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

146
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,325
[SPEAKER_05]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE

147
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:57,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh cool, like the little like, what do they call it, Megatouch and that stuff?

148
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but they were actually the ones with the controllers and everything on them.

149
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:01,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

150
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:11,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had an actual Pong, and they had the small child-sized machines, the SNK machines.

151
00:09:12,766 --> 00:09:13,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

152
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:14,927
[SPEAKER_03]: The Neo Geo ones, sorry.

153
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:17,169
[SPEAKER_03]: With like, you know, Puzzle Bobble.

154
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:22,287
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sounds like you had a lot of fun, and it sounds like I really missed out getting to see a journey machine.

155
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:25,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I did get to find, though, some of my favorite old tables were there, though, like Centaur.

156
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:28,529
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a Hyperball, which I refused to ever play again.

157
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid fucking Hyperball.

158
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,532
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had... I'm sorry, I'm trying to watch my language.

159
00:09:36,913 --> 00:09:37,353
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

160
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:40,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch it fly out of your mouth and affect people.

161
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:41,755
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, language.

162
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:42,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun.

163
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:46,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you play any, like, new games this week, or was it all pretty much retro gaming goodness?

164
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:46,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

165
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the Ultra Pin.

166
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:53,845
[SPEAKER_03]: That's technically new.

167
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:55,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I played DDR.

168
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:57,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Max 2.

169
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:01,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Cowgirl in Flip Flops.

170
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:11,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually kind of funny.

171
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:13,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, dude, I'm going to fall over.

172
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't.

173
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:14,627
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.

174
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:14,887
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

175
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:18,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, next year, the dude with the journey machine needs to come back to California Extreme so I can play it.

176
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I'll be sad.

177
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,593
[SPEAKER_03]: But my World Cup soccer is almost fixed up nice.

178
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:28,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is what pisses me off.

179
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,175
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really an FU.

180
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:29,676
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a...

181
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:35,881
[SPEAKER_03]: The one Theater of Magic they had, and the entire place was at the tournament area.

182
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:42,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you pay to do the stupid tournament, and you can't play the Theater of Magic, and I'm like, I want to play Theater of Magic!

183
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:43,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Theater of Magic's pretty badass.

184
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:44,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I did play the Devil Madness, though.

185
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:46,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I knocked down the castle, it was great.

186
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:52,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we gotta move on, but it sounds like you got a lot of good gaming in, even if most of it was pinball, not console games.

187
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinball's pretty rad.

188
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:54,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

189
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:55,912
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

190
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I get into my gaming week, though, I wanted to talk about, there was this game that I saw

191
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Neo Geo Battle Coliseum

192
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:15,111
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

193
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:40,196
[SPEAKER_05]: from King of Monsters.

194
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:41,576
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all kinds of rap.

195
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:34,889
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I also tried the Fatal Inertia demo which you know I've been really hyped up about the game ever since they first announced it because it reminded me of like you know kind of like F-Zero GX or something like that you know a combat racing game that was not the case with this this is crap and I thank god I played the demo because I'm not buying the game now it's just it's hard to control and it didn't seem that fast and I don't know I just didn't like the level layout it wasn't pretty enough for me so

196
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:36,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well.

197
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:48,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see, I also played 300 on the PSP because I had just watched the Blu-ray for it, so that game sucked also.

198
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:50,215
[SPEAKER_04]: But what do you expect?

199
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:50,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

200
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:52,497
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a hack and slash game.

201
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:53,838
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a movie tie-in game.

202
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:55,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, isn't that what the movie was?

203
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

204
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see the movie.

205
00:12:56,781 --> 00:12:58,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the movie was a lot better than that.

206
00:12:58,502 --> 00:12:59,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the one guy that didn't see 300.

207
00:12:59,603 --> 00:12:59,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

208
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:08,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um, I've been playing, actually, strangely enough, uh, well, Overlord I've been playing, and that game's still really fun.

209
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:16,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've also been playing, uh, this is gonna be really weird, um, Settlers of Catan, actually.

210
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:25,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, because I got hooked on this yesterday, actually, I was playing the actual board game, uh, with my sister and her boyfriend, and...

211
00:13:25,856 --> 00:13:31,858
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really fun, so I bought the Xbox Live Arcade game, and it's pretty much the same thing, except the AI is completely cheap.

212
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:37,420
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, the only thing I really wish it had was local multiplayer instead of just over live.

213
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,781
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be pretty cool, but they didn't.

214
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:43,282
[SPEAKER_05]: But this game has passed the wife test, right?

215
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:46,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, the wife is probably playing it right now, actually.

216
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:46,763
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.

217
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:49,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, she was playing it all afternoon, so...

218
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Crimey River.

219
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Crimey River.

220
00:14:12,938 --> 00:14:31,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, somebody in chat earlier, and I apologize, I forgot who said it, somebody had said, what's more funny than watching Grand Theft Auto 4 get delayed is watching everything else back out of its way now that it's been delayed, everything else is getting delayed because of that, or, you know, the other games that all kind of moved out of way, like the ripple effect that Grand Theft Auto is having, kind of interesting.

221
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:36,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at the chatroom and talking about some quotes there.

222
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,522
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it the Rob D said that was really funny?

223
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:44,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, about the Battle Coliseum game and how I said Mai could fight one of the King of the Monsters.

224
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:47,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Sky just wants to see Mai versus a tentacle monster, let's face it.

225
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:51,911
[SPEAKER_05]: That quote coming from the Rob D. Let's see.

226
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:53,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the Rob D didn't see 300 either.

227
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:55,774
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess I'm not the only one ever.

228
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:57,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what else is there.

229
00:14:59,217 --> 00:14:59,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh...

230
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:03,485
[SPEAKER_05]: RossDLUT impersonates Loki.

231
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:05,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Durr, I'm going to play this movie game.

232
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:07,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it'll suck less than all the others.

233
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose saying that all movie games usually suck.

234
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:14,870
[SPEAKER_04]: For the most part, they do.

235
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's some movie games that are okay.

236
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:20,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember some of the NES Batman games weren't that bad.

237
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that's true.

238
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:37,459
[SPEAKER_05]: and I actually liked the Friday the 13th game like it always ends up on like these worst NES games of all times list but that game actually scared me when I was a kid because it was kind of a scary game I don't know anyway but yeah movie games usually not not so much fun let's see

239
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:39,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Games I've been playing this week.

240
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:40,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of new stuff, unfortunately.

241
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:42,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been on World of Warcraft.

242
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:47,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really grinding like hell in World of Warcraft to try and get my character to level 70, so I'll be all ready by the time the next expansion comes out.

243
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:54,588
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, the fact is that I know all these console games are coming out very soon, especially when we get into the end of August.

244
00:15:54,928 --> 00:16:02,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue Dragon, Eternal Sonata, Halo, and then Metroid Prime 3 and all these games I'm going to want to be playing are all coming out soon.

245
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:05,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to get as much grinding in as I can before I get distracted by the console games.

246
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:08,579
[SPEAKER_05]: So most of my week has been spent on the PC playing WoW.

247
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, though, I have been playing some other console games.

248
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:17,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing Kingdom Hearts 2 more, and I finally surpassed my first save game, so I guess that's kind of cool.

249
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:26,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I checked out probably like all the... because I was without internet for a little while, because, you know, if you listened to last week's show, you know Comcast finally didn't come out here until Tuesday.

250
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:31,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, let me say, Comcast said they were going to come here in a window between 12 and 4.

251
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:32,579
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what time they finally got here?

252
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:33,540
[SPEAKER_05]: 7.30, 8 o'clock.

253
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:39,731
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, then I would... Don't you get some money or something off your bill?

254
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:40,571
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a $20 credit.

255
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:41,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, whoopee!

256
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:42,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoopee-doo!

257
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:48,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoopee-doo, that's like... Then they installed all this shit we didn't ask for, like all the HBO and Showtime channels.

258
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:49,157
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't want that shit.

259
00:16:49,437 --> 00:16:53,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was cool for one night, because I got to watch Big Brother After Dark, which is kind of cheesy fun.

260
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,441
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we had to get rid of that.

261
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:56,961
[SPEAKER_05]: They just totally screwed up the order.

262
00:16:56,981 --> 00:16:59,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually surprised they remembered to put the HD in there.

263
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:00,464
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bad.

264
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:00,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bad.

265
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:07,029
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, otherwise my gaming week's been pretty light in that regard, just mostly World of Warcraft.

266
00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:11,913
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will be kicking back into high gear when we get into the end of the month.

267
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:13,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the Xbox Live Arcade games.

268
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:15,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I did catch up on all those ones I missed while I was out.

269
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:17,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really care for any of them.

270
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,279
[SPEAKER_05]: I played like four.

271
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:21,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like the Spyglass board games.

272
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:22,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like...

273
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:25,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Super, well, Super Contra was okay.

274
00:17:25,603 --> 00:17:27,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, and Track and Field is okay.

275
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:30,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Surprisingly, I actually think I played Track and Field more than any of the other ones.

276
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking about buying Track and Field.

277
00:17:32,648 --> 00:17:33,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It just looks stupid.

278
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's just back and forth with the analog stick, isn't it?

279
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:43,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that or you can use the buttons, because the actual arcade machine used buttons, like giant poppin' music style buttons.

280
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:48,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you know what I suggest doing, since I think, aren't the controls completely configurable and stuff like that?

281
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,370
[SPEAKER_04]: DDR pads, man.

282
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out the DDR pads and bust it out like track and field.

283
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:54,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

284
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:55,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

285
00:17:56,234 --> 00:18:01,799
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the most thrilling game ever, but for some reason I like those old retro games, so it's fun to me.

286
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:10,045
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know if I'd actually recommend it to a lot of people, because it's certainly not one of the better Konami arcade ports that's on Marketplace.

287
00:18:10,697 --> 00:18:14,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's move on and get into some housekeeping so we can get to tonight's news.

288
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:41,912
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

289
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:25,869
[SPEAKER_05]: and they highlighted us this week as kind of like they were mentioning all the podcasts they had that week and they had themselves because Joystick does their own podcast but they're a little bit irregular but I guess they did two weeks in a row so they were nominating themselves for having done two weeks in a row like saying hooray for us and then they followed up with us and saying well now we have these guys who've been doing it for years and years so that was just kind of funny so we appreciate the plug but it's hilarious that it happened the week that our show was like totally broken and like Jamie wasn't even here and

290
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:28,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had all the sound issues we had last week.

291
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,811
[SPEAKER_05]: It was nuts.

292
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:35,775
[SPEAKER_04]: And what the listeners couldn't see last week is I was also trying to read stories while keeping the spaghetti away from my cat.

293
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:39,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I had a plate of spaghetti and she kept trying to attack the plate.

294
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,659
[SPEAKER_05]: The sound was so horrible last week.

295
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:45,862
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for some reason, there was little packet losses throughout the file.

296
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:50,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So suddenly you'd be... And then the words would drop out.

297
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:50,625
[SPEAKER_05]: It was bad.

298
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost felt like I was gonna burst into flames, you know?

299
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,660
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we almost had a webcam tonight, but I just didn't get it set up in time.

300
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,982
[SPEAKER_05]: But speaking of Apple, my little Apple webcam and the laptop, so I can have it wherever.

301
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:27,403
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to wait until we move out to the garage to do that, so it'll be fun.

302
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:29,845
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who else likes that Seller is a Catan?

303
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:30,265
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

304
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:30,625
[SPEAKER_04]: My cat.

305
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:35,487
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll sit there in front of the TV and watch the dice move and the cards move and stuff.

306
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:37,528
[SPEAKER_04]: She's completely fascinated by it.

307
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:38,549
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

308
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:40,045
[SPEAKER_05]: XBOX 360 Core Model

309
00:21:02,342 --> 00:21:07,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of theorize that this might be happening, although I don't think it's anytime soon that it's going to happen.

310
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:22,291
[SPEAKER_04]: But the theory behind it is, other than the fact that it is showing discontinued in their system, is that they're replacing all of the current premium systems out there with the ones with HDMI, but they're not doing that with the core system.

311
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:27,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are thinking, okay, well, they're going to just sell out the core system and then discontinue it.

312
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:28,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

313
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:32,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Did Microsoft maybe do something to Target?

314
00:21:32,945 --> 00:21:36,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I noticed Target also, aren't they phasing out HD DVDs?

315
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember that was a previous report.

316
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:39,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Target that was doing that.

317
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:45,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're phasing them out of their store, but if you've ever gone into Target looking for HD product anyways...

318
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:50,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Their shelving that they have is like, it's literally maybe 12 movies that they have there.

319
00:21:50,957 --> 00:21:53,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Blu-ray and HD DVD combined.

320
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:57,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wouldn't exactly consider Target my number one stop for HD DVD purchasing.

321
00:21:58,061 --> 00:21:59,301
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's only in store.

322
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they have them still on the website.

323
00:22:00,922 --> 00:22:08,086
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little disheartening, though, to see HD DVDs be phased out when, you know, I spent as much money as I did on the HD player for the 360.

324
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:09,927
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my bad.

325
00:22:09,947 --> 00:22:10,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all numbers.

326
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:14,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if their Blu-ray product is selling and their HD is not, then...

327
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,553
[SPEAKER_04]: And then hopefully with season 2 or something they'll do it where you can download the episodes right after they air, that'd be awesome.

328
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:46,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Target isn't the only place that's phasing out the Xbox 360 Core model, according to some rumors out there right now.

329
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:49,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other store that is phasing them out, Best Buy.

330
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:59,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Buy, as apparently a little screenshot has come out of their system, shown that the status of the Xbox 360 Core hardware in their system was deleted on July 29, 2007.

331
00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:06,399
[SPEAKER_05]: So Microsoft denies that there's any type of Core production being stocked.

332
00:23:07,575 --> 00:23:08,836
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

333
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:28,287
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

334
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:49,834
[SPEAKER_04]: or it actually is something coming from Microsoft saying, hey, we're getting rid of the core model.

335
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:53,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's actually been announced yet.

336
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:57,958
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that is going to happen, probably won't happen until after Christmas.

337
00:23:58,778 --> 00:24:01,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, lots and lots of comments from chat on this one.

338
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,601
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Dark Knight says, Sears has never had the core models.

339
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:05,967
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

340
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven's Dolphin says, when Walmart says no more Core 360s, then it's done.

341
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:31,894
[SPEAKER_05]: RawSteelUT says, of course Microsoft would deny.

342
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:35,537
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably also deny that the Core only counts for maybe 20% of their sales.

343
00:24:36,377 --> 00:24:39,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Bandit says they should keep the Core for people who want to upgrade their memory later on.

344
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,160
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be more accessible to everyone.

345
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think they were going to announce the HDMI thing either until it leaked out, so, you know...

346
00:24:46,523 --> 00:24:46,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

347
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:57,073
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to join our chat room and give your comments, if you're listening live here on this Sunday night when we tape live, chat.orangeloungeradio.com By the way, some other chatters following up on the whole Target HD DVD thing.

348
00:24:57,393 --> 00:25:01,777
[SPEAKER_05]: GS191 says this, Target is not getting rid of HD DVD.

349
00:25:01,857 --> 00:25:06,701
[SPEAKER_05]: The Blu-ray camp just inked a deal for their product to be displayed more through the end of the year.

350
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:10,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonder Dog Harold follows that up with a web link that says that's true.

351
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So, very interesting.

352
00:25:15,662 --> 00:25:24,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, myself, being that I've got a Blu-ray player, then... But you don't have an HD DVD player, right?

353
00:25:24,944 --> 00:25:25,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

354
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:27,985
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the things you don't have in your house, amazingly enough.

355
00:25:28,065 --> 00:25:28,485
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them.

356
00:25:28,705 --> 00:25:29,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Amongst all the other crap you have.

357
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:31,746
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have an HD DVD player, though.

358
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:35,226
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I actually know more people who have Blu-ray players myself.

359
00:25:35,246 --> 00:25:36,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because they're built into the PlayStation 3s.

360
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:38,007
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't own PlayStation 3s.

361
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:38,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

362
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:43,788
[SPEAKER_03]: The new VIOs come built in with Blu-ray players.

363
00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:48,875
[SPEAKER_05]: See, Sony just used... I mean, you know, if HD DVD loses, then it loses.

364
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:52,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine, I went with the wrong format, but... I'm surprised.

365
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony is really pushing with all their... Because, you know, Sony is not just a gaming company.

366
00:25:56,458 --> 00:26:06,501
[SPEAKER_05]: They are an electronics company and a major one at that, so it's kind of... They've been able to sneak Blu-ray into all these other little places, and it's worked for them, where, for whatever reason, Beta didn't.

367
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:11,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, there is still some hope, though, for people who...

368
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:19,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's not specifically HD related, but they are dropping the price of the Xbox 360.

369
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:28,349
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually said that it was scheduled to happen on August 8th, so the price reduction should already be in place.

370
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:34,052
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are seeing the Elite model go to $449, the Pro model to $349, and the Core at $279.

371
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:34,192
[SPEAKER_03]: So

372
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:45,680
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course the premium had the biggest drop, given that that's the best seller.

373
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And that price drop was totally a surprise to me.

374
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:52,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody out there on the internet.

375
00:26:52,464 --> 00:26:55,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the entire internet was shocked and awed at that price drop.

376
00:26:55,706 --> 00:27:05,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually curious though, well I guess I don't think we have any stories on this tonight, so I can say that, I think I want to say I read somewhere that Amazon, you know, the sales of the Xbox 360 went through the roof after the price drop.

377
00:27:06,272 --> 00:27:09,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just kind of curious if the same thing happened to retail outlets or what happened.

378
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you surprised they made the move at this time?

379
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm actually kind of a little surprised they didn't wait until a little closer to Christmas.

380
00:27:17,393 --> 00:27:20,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I would have expected the price drop a little more October-ish.

381
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:26,658
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe then again with Halo 3 coming out when it is, maybe they wanted to do it in advance of Halo 3, which would certainly make sense.

382
00:27:27,819 --> 00:27:28,219
[SPEAKER_05]: So who knows?

383
00:27:29,961 --> 00:27:38,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to mention there was another story I remember reading, I guess, that the NPD group did a survey with people saying, you know, kind of...

384
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:42,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Asking them whether they're aware of different features of their console.

385
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:47,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess there was like almost like 60% of people didn't realize that the PlayStation 3 had a Blu-ray player in it.

386
00:27:47,844 --> 00:27:49,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Or had never used it for like Blu-ray movies.

387
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:51,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I thought that was a little bit funny.

388
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:53,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho.

389
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:55,331
[SPEAKER_05]: What I want to know is what are they using it for then?

390
00:27:55,671 --> 00:27:56,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Motorstorm?

391
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:57,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

392
00:27:58,034 --> 00:27:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: The basketball game that's on it?

393
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:00,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

394
00:28:00,256 --> 00:28:02,678
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be all that wonderful download content that's online.

395
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:03,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, no, that's right.

396
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:03,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

397
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:08,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, anyways, other countries are also getting a 360 price drop.

398
00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:11,714
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, Canadians are seeing a pretty big price drop.

399
00:28:11,754 --> 00:28:18,738
[SPEAKER_04]: They will see a $100, um, of course that's in Canadian money, um, drop on the premium and core systems.

400
00:28:19,238 --> 00:28:20,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty awesome.

401
00:28:20,939 --> 00:28:28,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, yeah, so after that price drop, uh, the premium will be running, I guess, approximately $378 US.

402
00:28:28,102 --> 00:28:33,925
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, still, you know, of course with the exchange rates, uh,

403
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,252
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

404
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:57,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

405
00:29:16,752 --> 00:29:18,913
[SPEAKER_05]: There wasn't really a whole lot else to that firmware update.

406
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:26,616
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of a bummer, too, because, you know, when you turn on your Xbox 360 and you see, ooh, a new firmware update is available, you kind of start to get a little bit excited.

407
00:29:26,636 --> 00:29:30,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, ooh, I wonder what new features they've added this week, you know, or what they're adding.

408
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:32,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is this the big seasonal update?

409
00:29:32,278 --> 00:29:35,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they do a big one in fall and I think spring.

410
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:37,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, it's summer, so that wouldn't make sense for my brain to go there.

411
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,102
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can still help but get a little bit excited when the thing comes up and says there's a firmware update.

412
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:43,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, ooh, what cool new feature are they going to add?

413
00:29:43,903 --> 00:29:44,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it turns out to be nothing.

414
00:29:46,423 --> 00:29:46,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well.

415
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:47,184
[SPEAKER_03]: That poo.

416
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:49,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, I mean... That big stinky poop.

417
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:54,068
[SPEAKER_05]: It was unexpected, so it's, you know, can't really beg for a lot with that.

418
00:29:54,588 --> 00:30:11,478
[SPEAKER_03]: For anybody who is actually excited about anything having to do with Halo, well, Halo 3, I should say, or likes having green Xbox 360s, the Halo-themed Xbox 360 will be out in September, priced for $399 with a wireless headset for $59.99.

419
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:11,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

420
00:30:18,496 --> 00:30:20,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really see anything all that special about it.

421
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:22,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It says it's Spartan green and gold.

422
00:30:22,618 --> 00:30:28,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, it looks to me like it's baby poop green with orange.

423
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,581
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's what it looks like.

424
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:36,484
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as your HDMI cables, that comes separately.

425
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:40,005
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly how they should market it, too.

426
00:30:40,025 --> 00:30:42,426
[SPEAKER_05]: You have an HDMI port.

427
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:45,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they all have the HDMI port now.

428
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:46,008
[SPEAKER_02]: But no cable.

429
00:30:46,576 --> 00:30:51,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, the only thing that you get for the extra $50 is you get a plain charge kit that's also the, I guess, baby poop green.

430
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:57,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get the wonderful baby poop green paint job.

431
00:30:57,965 --> 00:30:59,606
[SPEAKER_03]: It does look like baby poo.

432
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:00,487
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that type of green.

433
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:03,369
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do want HDMI cables, those will cost you about $50.

434
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:10,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to be sold separately, actually, now that all the 360s, the premiums with the HDMI are coming up.

435
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:13,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yay!

436
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:17,360
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the... There's no Halo 3 with it, even.

437
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:18,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is kind of, come on.

438
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:20,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, why didn't they do that?

439
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:25,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know there's people that are going to go out and buy their Xbox 360 the day that Halo 3 comes out.

440
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,873
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to finally make that upgrade, because they've been playing Halo 2 this whole time.

441
00:31:29,094 --> 00:31:32,457
[SPEAKER_04]: And in case you forgot, there are also two custom Halo 3...

442
00:31:34,864 --> 00:31:36,145
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

443
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:08,612
[SPEAKER_05]: SonOfDad in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com calls the new color Split Pea in Halo Chunky Style Xbox 360.

444
00:32:09,832 --> 00:32:10,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Delicious.

445
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:12,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Mmm, yummy.

446
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:18,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyways, speaking of Halo 3, apparently there are a lot of fans out there.

447
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,420
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, who knew?

448
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:27,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3 has become the fastest-selling pre-ordered game in history.

449
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:34,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, 1 million pre-orders have been taken in North America, a new record, apparently, for those keeping track.

450
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:45,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, this all ties in with their marketing campaign, including 7-Eleven, Burger King, Comcast, Mountain Dew, and Pontiac.

451
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:50,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, Pontiac, how the fuck does that relate to Halo?

452
00:32:51,225 --> 00:32:56,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I can understand the 7-Eleven, because you have that Halo Mountain Dew crap and stuff that you can sell that.

453
00:32:56,948 --> 00:33:01,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and then maybe Burger King, because it's on their cups and shit, and maybe there's some kids' toys or something.

454
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,971
[SPEAKER_04]: But Pontiac, come on.

455
00:33:04,452 --> 00:33:06,472
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing to... Seriously.

456
00:33:06,793 --> 00:33:08,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to hop on the bandwagon?

457
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you really that hard up in selling your cars?

458
00:33:10,474 --> 00:33:11,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're going to make tanks.

459
00:33:15,322 --> 00:33:16,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty funny.

460
00:33:16,523 --> 00:33:19,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Pontiac's getting into the war car building business.

461
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:23,667
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, would you want a war car made by Pontiac?

462
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:29,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's just like, you know, this is my Volkswagen killing machine.

463
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's crap.

464
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:35,513
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, because remember, Volkswagen wouldn't lend their likenesses for that kind of thing.

465
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:40,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd buy the Volkswagen one before I'd buy a Ford one, that's for sure.

466
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:42,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Found on road dead.

467
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:44,618
[SPEAKER_03]: The fix-off and repair daily.

468
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:49,981
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they release like a Covenant car and a Spartan car that you can have the fucking Halo fans.

469
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:53,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to fucking kill you in my Spartan car.

470
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:53,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.

471
00:33:54,304 --> 00:33:55,685
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better than your Covenant car.

472
00:33:56,046 --> 00:33:57,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm driving a Pontiac.

473
00:33:57,747 --> 00:33:58,487
[SPEAKER_05]: You're both losers.

474
00:33:58,567 --> 00:34:02,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd buy a Pontiac if they put guns in the front of it so I can shoot people who get in my way.

475
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

476
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:05,586
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, maybe not.

477
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:10,069
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wanted to say about this, how is Halo 3 tied into the Comcast thing?

478
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:14,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we didn't get a baby shit green cable box.

479
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:15,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's why.

480
00:34:15,291 --> 00:34:20,814
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have videos on their Comcast on-demand service, the service that I never use ever.

481
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:22,855
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have that on there.

482
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:24,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

483
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:26,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they even going to bother and do it next game?

484
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:29,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it justifies them raising the rates on their cable.

485
00:34:30,032 --> 00:34:30,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you!

486
00:34:30,753 --> 00:34:32,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I get Halo exclusive content!

487
00:34:33,376 --> 00:34:34,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're raising my rates and they're $5!

488
00:34:35,618 --> 00:34:37,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Comcast!

489
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:41,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Boof.

490
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:50,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I could just imagine my roommate's reaction if, you know, because it was bad enough when they only offered him the $20 discount for wasting his whole day and then, like, fucking up his total order.

491
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:56,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I could just imagine if the thing had been, you know, oh, well, we're really sorry about the inconvenience.

492
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:58,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some free Halo 3 trailers.

493
00:34:59,263 --> 00:34:59,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

494
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:00,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah!

495
00:35:00,604 --> 00:35:03,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Joy plus rapture equals no.

496
00:35:04,606 --> 00:35:04,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

497
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:06,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

498
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:15,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not surprised about the whole pre-order record-breaking thing, because like what you said, the whole 7-Eleven tie-ins, like we talked about last week, how you can pre-order Halo 3 at 7-Eleven now.

499
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:17,030
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

500
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just the fact that, you know, many, many stores whore their pre-orderings now.

501
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:26,996
[SPEAKER_05]: They've all taken a page from GameStop, and of course GameStop's still king of their game every time somebody comes in.

502
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you want to reserve Halo 3?

503
00:35:28,597 --> 00:35:29,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you want to reserve Halo 3?

504
00:35:29,557 --> 00:35:31,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see you're buying Bratz for the DS.

505
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you want to reserve Halo 3?

506
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:32,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

507
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:37,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, hey, you want to buy Madden from us?

508
00:35:37,111 --> 00:35:38,512
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you a free mini poster.

509
00:35:40,112 --> 00:35:40,573
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

510
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:41,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like Madden.

511
00:35:42,494 --> 00:35:43,014
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Halo 3?

512
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:44,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck off!

513
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:48,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I've been hearing about nothing but Madden lately.

514
00:35:48,237 --> 00:35:48,957
[SPEAKER_03]: You just bought Halo 3.

515
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:50,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to pre-order Halo 3?

516
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:55,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I call Dan's store, it's like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, reserve Madden.

517
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:56,401
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

518
00:35:57,941 --> 00:36:01,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I can imagine walking into GameStop, yes, I'm here to reserve Halo 3.

519
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:03,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, great!

520
00:36:03,565 --> 00:36:05,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to reserve Halo 4 while you're at it?

521
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:13,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if anyone, if they should have partnered up with a car dealership or a car company, it should have been, like, the fucking Hummer.

522
00:36:13,832 --> 00:36:16,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Because at least that's the size of the Warthog, okay?

523
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:16,674
[SPEAKER_04]: A Humvee.

524
00:36:17,055 --> 00:36:18,576
[SPEAKER_04]: A Humvee, whatever.

525
00:36:20,697 --> 00:36:25,581
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing I'm kind of curious about with all this is...

526
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:29,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what I wanted to say earlier that I couldn't think of.

527
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:39,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the worst trends in retail across the board that I've seen now is fake boxes to try to get you to pre-order the game.

528
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:45,286
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be walking down Best Buy and go, oh, I didn't know this game was out, and you reach for it and you grab it, and then it's like, oh, a little sticker.

529
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:45,766
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the point.

530
00:36:45,866 --> 00:36:46,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Pre-order.

531
00:36:46,606 --> 00:36:49,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, and it's a horrible, horrible trick that I always fall for.

532
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:53,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Last summer, they had Madden 08 already in GameStop.

533
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:53,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I kid you not.

534
00:36:53,989 --> 00:36:56,570
[SPEAKER_04]: They made up their own box art so you can pre-order Madden 08.

535
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,831
[SPEAKER_04]: This was literally weeks after Madden 07 came out.

536
00:37:01,004 --> 00:37:01,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

537
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:02,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

538
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:11,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Tigerclaw says, Sky, I went to GameStop on Saturday and one of the employees, for some bizarre reason, was wearing a cardboard box over his head.

539
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:14,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it say pre-order Halo 3 on the top, maybe?

540
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:14,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

541
00:37:15,598 --> 00:37:20,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing, do we really need press releases that go out when your game's put out?

542
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:22,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the fastest selling game ever!

543
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Until the next game comes out and then it'll sell more.

544
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:26,188
[SPEAKER_04]: You know...

545
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:27,257
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

546
00:37:34,269 --> 00:37:36,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone knew Halo 3 was in existence.

547
00:37:37,210 --> 00:38:02,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on off the Halo 3 talk, because there's plenty of other things on the Xbox 360 people are looking forward to, including the next round of Xbox Live Arcade games, and there's a lot of games slated to be coming out over the next couple months, including the much-anticipated Hexic 2, also Echo the Dolphin, War World, Geon Emotions, Puzzle Quest, yay, Space Giraffe,

548
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:08,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Streets of Rage 2, and of course Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix

549
00:38:09,944 --> 00:38:11,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually very much looking forward to that game

550
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be interesting, I know.

551
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,806
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of what I thought when I read that.

552
00:38:42,826 --> 00:38:44,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, so they want you to make more power gems?

553
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:50,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay, Drenami, you don't use Dan unless you think that you're like God's gift to Puzzle Fighter.

554
00:38:51,192 --> 00:38:54,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you want to have a really hilarious Dan versus Dan match.

555
00:38:54,814 --> 00:38:56,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he does nothing but drop red blocks.

556
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, that's awesome.

557
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:02,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the chat room is daring to correct me.

558
00:39:02,379 --> 00:39:07,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitstun says, there's an X dash mode with the new drop patterns, but there's also the original X mode.

559
00:39:08,203 --> 00:39:08,583
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

560
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:10,144
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

561
00:39:40,257 --> 00:39:48,839
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a label of Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 1 on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness to be out in the fall.

562
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:54,721
[SPEAKER_05]: This one surprised me at all because there's already Penny Arcade content on Xbox Live and has been for a long, long time.

563
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:59,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you can get themes and little clip arts or the little gamer pictures and stuff.

564
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:00,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's amazing.

565
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:07,004
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's anything less than amazing, I'll be like, well, crap.

566
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:08,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably download it anyway.

567
00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:20,569
[SPEAKER_05]: But it wouldn't surprise me at all if there ended up being a Penny Arcade game on the marketplace because Microsoft's kind of like that lately is that they're really trying to get into those fan communities and the thing that the internet's all abuzz about.

568
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:21,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft wants a part of that.

569
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:23,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's nothing actually confirmed yet.

570
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,091
[SPEAKER_05]: All they'd have to do is throw money at them.

571
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Money is what moves the world.

572
00:40:28,771 --> 00:40:29,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

573
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:30,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

574
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:32,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

575
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:48,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool!

576
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:50,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get Madden on the Atari.

577
00:40:50,227 --> 00:40:51,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it on the Turbo Duo!

578
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:53,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen the Simpsons game trailer?

579
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:54,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually has that.

580
00:40:54,750 --> 00:41:02,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, coming out for all game systems, and it shows the Coleco, Atari, Intellivision, Jaguar.

581
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:05,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, they should put it out on those systems.

582
00:41:05,057 --> 00:41:05,818
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be rad.

583
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:10,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so no, it is coming out on most everything, I think, except for the Game Boy Advance.

584
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:17,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if you're not into Madden, on PlayStation 2, Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3,

585
00:41:18,606 --> 00:41:19,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on PlayStation 2.

586
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:23,488
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I brought my copy for you so you can try it out.

587
00:41:23,728 --> 00:41:24,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray!

588
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see, Metropolis Mania 2.

589
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,771
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also coming out.

590
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:35,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1.

591
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:37,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

592
00:41:38,674 --> 00:41:40,915
[SPEAKER_04]: On PSP, Dungeons & Dragons Tactics.

593
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:44,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Ghost Recon... Oh, no, that's next week.

594
00:41:44,156 --> 00:41:44,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, sorry.

595
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:45,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

596
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:53,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, other than that... Oh, DS!

597
00:41:53,564 --> 00:41:54,764
[SPEAKER_04]: DS, there's some good stuff.

598
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:58,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Luminous Ark, that's supposed to be pretty good.

599
00:41:58,206 --> 00:42:00,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Rune Factory, a fantasy Harvest Moon.

600
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:03,968
[SPEAKER_04]: How many Harvest Moon games will come out this year?

601
00:42:04,028 --> 00:42:04,968
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.

602
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:08,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Heroes of Mana, that's supposed to be actually pretty good on the DS.

603
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Operation Vietnam, and High School Musical...

604
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Making the cut.

605
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:18,065
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that's pretty much it.

606
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:19,567
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Madden or nothing.

607
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:22,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well I'm out.

608
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was Nerf or nothing.

609
00:42:25,214 --> 00:42:25,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Not anymore.

610
00:42:26,568 --> 00:42:32,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm heading over to the Japanese release dates, and I'm here to tell you there's not a goddamn thing worth noting coming out in Japan this week.

611
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:33,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

612
00:42:34,191 --> 00:42:34,671
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing.

613
00:42:35,111 --> 00:42:36,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely nothing coming out over there.

614
00:42:37,232 --> 00:42:40,793
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if you happen to live in Korea, you're getting some of the same things we are.

615
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:45,375
[SPEAKER_05]: You're also getting Persona 3 on the PlayStation 2, but otherwise, it's a very slow week.

616
00:42:46,015 --> 00:42:46,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing of note.

617
00:42:46,996 --> 00:42:50,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I guess there's a couple small titles, but nothing worth mentioning, honestly.

618
00:42:50,757 --> 00:42:51,337
[SPEAKER_05]: So, slow week.

619
00:42:52,578 --> 00:42:53,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it's about the same.

620
00:42:53,918 --> 00:42:55,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm over in the UK right now.

621
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:58,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Premier Manager 08, and Two Worlds.

622
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:01,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Slow times.

623
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:02,304
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

624
00:43:02,404 --> 00:43:05,388
[SPEAKER_03]: However, lucky people getting Blue Dragon on the 24th.

625
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:06,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we are, too.

626
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

627
00:43:07,871 --> 00:43:09,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So hey, we get something at the same time.

628
00:43:09,874 --> 00:43:11,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're getting Blazing Angels later, too.

629
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:13,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

630
00:43:13,867 --> 00:43:15,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just the calm before the storm right here.

631
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:23,694
[SPEAKER_05]: August is always the slow period, so we're going to start seeing things really pick up very soon here, like Blue Dragon, Metroid Prime 3.

632
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:27,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we get into next month and the Halo, everything.

633
00:43:27,277 --> 00:43:28,498
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a mess.

634
00:43:28,578 --> 00:43:33,562
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a to-be-announced on here for Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System.

635
00:43:34,743 --> 00:43:35,804
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get a date on that.

636
00:43:36,604 --> 00:43:37,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that already came out.

637
00:43:37,905 --> 00:43:38,866
[SPEAKER_05]: It came out in Japan, yeah.

638
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:40,247
[SPEAKER_05]: That was last week's releases in Japan.

639
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:44,934
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sating, pending for the UK, but nothing specific.

640
00:43:45,315 --> 00:43:46,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish it would come out over here.

641
00:43:46,675 --> 00:43:50,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they put out a press release saying that's the crappiest title for a game, or a Final Fantasy game.

642
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:57,488
[SPEAKER_05]: TheRobD would like to say August ain't slow this year because you're getting a Bioshock and Madden and everything.

643
00:43:57,508 --> 00:44:01,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know, I know, but I'm saying like, you know, that's all towards the end of the month.

644
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

645
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play Blue Dragon and Bioshock.

646
00:44:04,551 --> 00:44:06,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not Blue Dragon.

647
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:07,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about the other stuff.

648
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:09,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just because you guys are anti-Madden.

649
00:44:09,694 --> 00:44:12,315
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a slow month, even though those games are coming out.

650
00:44:12,455 --> 00:44:13,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look at it.

651
00:44:13,496 --> 00:44:18,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so Bioshock, that's coming out next week, in the week of the 21st, and, well...

652
00:44:22,256 --> 00:44:22,656
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

653
00:44:23,296 --> 00:44:23,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

654
00:44:23,637 --> 00:44:29,339
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically you're saying the problem with this month is that you just have these few A-list titles kind of tent-pulling us through the month.

655
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:29,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

656
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:30,480
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of other stuff.

657
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:39,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Bioshock's next week, and then the week after that you've got the Blue Dragon, Metroid Prime 3, Stuntman Ignition, Tiger Woods 08, and stuff like that.

658
00:44:39,563 --> 00:44:42,665
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's pretty much it for the rest of the month.

659
00:44:42,825 --> 00:44:49,968
[SPEAKER_04]: September is crazy, and then beyond that it's just... I don't even want to... I fear November.

660
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:55,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Blue Dragon's the only one out of that list that I'm looking forward to.

661
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not as looking forward to Metroid Prime 3 as you might think.

662
00:44:58,682 --> 00:45:03,223
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very, very, very disappointed that Nintendo did not decide to go online multiplayer with it.

663
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:04,464
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a Metroid Metroid.

664
00:45:06,064 --> 00:45:06,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Like old school Metroid?

665
00:45:06,925 --> 00:45:07,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

666
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we get them on virtual console.

667
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:09,205
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing else.

668
00:45:09,225 --> 00:45:09,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week, I think.

669
00:45:10,106 --> 00:45:12,146
[SPEAKER_03]: We need an actual new Metroid game.

670
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:13,607
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Metroid Wii.

671
00:45:14,387 --> 00:45:14,807
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

672
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:16,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Metroid Metroid.

673
00:45:16,028 --> 00:45:17,128
[SPEAKER_03]: We love Metroid.

674
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:17,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's Metroid Prime 3.

675
00:45:17,968 --> 00:45:18,008
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

676
00:45:20,077 --> 00:45:20,357
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a 2D?

677
00:45:20,377 --> 00:45:22,099
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to be specific.

678
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,480
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a 2D Metroid on the Wii?

679
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a 2D Metroid on the Wii.

680
00:45:25,902 --> 00:45:34,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like, you know how the Sega Ages Fantasy Zone is with the 3D, 2D look?

681
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:36,791
[SPEAKER_03]: You need something like that.

682
00:45:36,811 --> 00:45:45,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you heard, but there's rumors going around saying that Castlevania Aria of Sorrow is going to be shown at Let's Big on the PC.

683
00:45:46,247 --> 00:45:49,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if it's on the PC, then it could ideally come to consoles.

684
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:53,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the Game Boy Advance one, so... Well, we'll see.

685
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:56,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go ahead and move on and get back into some news.

686
00:45:57,896 --> 00:46:02,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Anywho, so we were talking a little bit earlier about firmware updates for the 360.

687
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:10,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the Wii couldn't be left out, so they decided to update to version 3, which you get some spiffy shit with that.

688
00:46:11,426 --> 00:46:11,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

689
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:19,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, nothing major like the Check Me Out channel or anything like that, but you get a wonderful digital clock.

690
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:20,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Hurrah.

691
00:46:21,547 --> 00:46:25,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And the forecast channel now displays the current condition.

692
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:27,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet it doesn't display the temperature.

693
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:34,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And the current condition is still, like, I'll boot up my Wii at like 4 o'clock in the evening and it shows a picture of a moon.

694
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:36,700
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

695
00:46:54,155 --> 00:47:03,099
[SPEAKER_04]: The message board now has today's accomplishments message as a white message which will allow it to stand out from other messages.

696
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I still hate those today's accomplishment things.

697
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:15,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Address book can now be shifted around using A and B. Calendar no longer shows today's accomplishments.

698
00:47:16,403 --> 00:47:20,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Scrolling messages in the Wii message board now use a different sound.

699
00:47:21,517 --> 00:47:26,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess in the Wii Shop channel, they've got some other stuff you can search by category, publisher, genre.

700
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:30,739
[SPEAKER_05]: But you still can't look at videos within the Wii Shop channel.

701
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:33,499
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go onto the internet to see that.

702
00:47:34,179 --> 00:47:44,821
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, you know, there's some settings, I guess, warning added to pre-system update detailing that technically modified consoles may cease to function.

703
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:46,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So we break your mod chips!

704
00:47:47,482 --> 00:47:47,982
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

705
00:47:48,722 --> 00:47:48,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

706
00:47:49,278 --> 00:47:49,638
[SPEAKER_04]: GameCubeGames.com

707
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:20,317
[SPEAKER_05]: One other thing that should be said is the Wii system update also made the USB keyboards now start working.

708
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:28,602
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually plug in a USB keyboard into the back of the Wii and you can use your keyboard for the message board messages.

709
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:30,824
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use it to type in some things.

710
00:48:31,444 --> 00:48:35,447
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use it when you're writing questions for everybody votes or whatever.

711
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:38,369
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also do the internet channel.

712
00:48:38,629 --> 00:48:39,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.

713
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:42,572
[SPEAKER_05]: However, you can't use it in the shop channel to search.

714
00:48:43,332 --> 00:48:44,892
[SPEAKER_05]: and I don't know what that's about.

715
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:47,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you use it in the internet channel?

716
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I thought you couldn't.

717
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:50,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently you can.

718
00:48:50,633 --> 00:48:51,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure you can.

719
00:48:51,454 --> 00:48:53,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

720
00:48:53,134 --> 00:48:53,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to try it.

721
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:58,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought a USB keyboard for Final Fantasy XI for the 360 and then I stopped playing.

722
00:48:58,675 --> 00:49:00,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have one sitting out there that I don't really use.

723
00:49:00,535 --> 00:49:01,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And it glows blue.

724
00:49:01,395 --> 00:49:02,015
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really pretty.

725
00:49:03,056 --> 00:49:05,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I still had one from when I played Blue Burst.

726
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:06,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah.

727
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:08,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I should just say Fantasy Star Online.

728
00:49:09,297 --> 00:49:09,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

729
00:49:10,477 --> 00:49:10,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

730
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:14,267
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, there's other stuff.

731
00:49:16,589 --> 00:49:16,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

732
00:49:17,529 --> 00:49:17,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

733
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:18,210
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

734
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:18,650
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

735
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I screwed up.

736
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:22,993
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually you can't use it to do any of that other stuff.

737
00:49:23,013 --> 00:49:25,434
[SPEAKER_05]: You can only use the keyboard for the message board messages.

738
00:49:26,035 --> 00:49:26,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I screwed up.

739
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:28,576
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a can't on the Internet channel.

740
00:49:29,177 --> 00:49:30,377
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

741
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what I get for not testing it myself.

742
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:35,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not kind of interested in that.

743
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:41,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, why would I use the Wii to surf the Internet when I have a computer five steps away that can do it?

744
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't get it.

745
00:49:43,126 --> 00:49:46,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people, I guess, want everything to do everything.

746
00:49:46,307 --> 00:49:49,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I like having one thing that does one thing and another thing that does another thing.

747
00:49:50,768 --> 00:50:05,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyway, for anyone who has actually been keeping up with Super Mario Galaxy, there has been a few screenshots put in Famitsu showing that there is a desert world and a haunted house.

748
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:07,953
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get our buddy Boo coming back.

749
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:10,974
[SPEAKER_04]: A desert world and a haunted house in a Mario game?

750
00:50:11,014 --> 00:50:12,294
[SPEAKER_04]: That's completely new!

751
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:17,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

752
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:21,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost interest in Mario Sunshine about halfway through it.

753
00:50:23,584 --> 00:50:26,626
[SPEAKER_03]: But Super Mario Galaxy will be coming out later this year.

754
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:33,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want it to actually keep my attention.

755
00:50:35,552 --> 00:50:35,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

756
00:50:37,424 --> 00:50:39,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, some other interesting stuff coming out.

757
00:50:39,586 --> 00:50:53,795
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a patent found online for a motion sensing portable, or at least something for a portable system to sense directional movements on all different axes.

758
00:50:54,055 --> 00:50:59,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, a six-axis built into a Game Boy Advance type thing.

759
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:05,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So, maybe something in the future to be added to...

760
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:32,482
[SPEAKER_04]: The DS, new handheld console, who knows If I were to guess, I would say that maybe something to plug into the Game Boy Advance Or actually the DS, the Game Boy Advance slot To use that actually as a controller for different games Because the DS, it can connect to the Wii So might as well add some tilt sensing to it as well

761
00:51:35,454 --> 00:51:37,596
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I hope they're not putting out another portable system.

762
00:51:38,036 --> 00:51:38,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they will.

763
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:41,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll call the Game Boy something else.

764
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:43,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll be like, ha, you get to buy it again, bitch.

765
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of me kind of hopes that they're doing this so that nobody else will.

766
00:51:47,883 --> 00:51:55,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, maybe they're doing one of those, like, what is it, the company that keeps filing the patents on the... Immersion?

767
00:51:55,488 --> 00:52:01,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like they're doing one of those type of patents where they're just doing it before anyone else can think of it because of the success of the Wii.

768
00:52:01,372 --> 00:52:01,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

769
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:04,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope not.

770
00:52:06,482 --> 00:52:06,822
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

771
00:52:08,143 --> 00:52:21,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, for the Nintendo consoles, as we mentioned earlier, Metroid and Super Metroid have been confirmed that they are on their way to the virtual console a little later this month, leading up to, of course, the release of Metroid Prime 3.

772
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:29,915
[SPEAKER_05]: All this can be found in the new Metroid Prime 3 preview channel, which you can download for the Wii, which I tried to do, but it wouldn't work.

773
00:52:29,975 --> 00:52:32,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I got like three download arrows in a row, so I was like, forget it.

774
00:52:32,796 --> 00:52:35,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you check out the Metroid Prime 3 preview channel?

775
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:38,423
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

776
00:53:06,147 --> 00:53:06,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

777
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:10,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew Nami says, it's cool, but it's YouTube, basically.

778
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:18,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can't get an accurate portrayal of what the game looks like with something like YouTube graphics.

779
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:25,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait for someone to modify that channel because I'm sure that whatever it's streaming is probably off the internet and not on your console.

780
00:53:26,093 --> 00:53:35,836
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be pretty cool to change the DNS in it or something to stream video off of other things so you could actually turn it into not really YouTube, but I don't know.

781
00:53:36,564 --> 00:53:39,245
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, tell the kids where they should be pointing their web browsers this week.

782
00:54:07,259 --> 00:54:13,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's website of the week is really a result of wishful thinking on my part.

783
00:54:14,282 --> 00:54:16,863
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's ferretsunlimited.org.

784
00:54:17,203 --> 00:54:21,685
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a shelter for ferrets.

785
00:54:22,026 --> 00:54:23,486
[SPEAKER_03]: They have adoption services.

786
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:25,427
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually in Ohio.

787
00:54:26,107 --> 00:54:31,210
[SPEAKER_03]: But the good thing about this site is it also has information about needs.

788
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,211
[SPEAKER_03]: It has links to other shelters, how to shop.

789
00:54:36,298 --> 00:54:40,180
[SPEAKER_03]: How to take care of your ferret and a bunch of links.

790
00:54:40,821 --> 00:54:45,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on trying to eventually have a ferret baby myself.

791
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though they're still illegal to own in California, aren't they?

792
00:54:48,545 --> 00:54:50,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Not if somebody brings them from out of state.

793
00:54:51,507 --> 00:54:54,929
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to smuggle in a ferret in California?

794
00:54:54,949 --> 00:54:56,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to smuggle in a ferret, hell yeah.

795
00:54:57,025 --> 00:54:58,606
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably wouldn't be the first one to do it, I'm sure.

796
00:54:58,626 --> 00:54:58,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no.

797
00:54:59,267 --> 00:55:09,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, there's a few other sites out there on the internet that tell you where in California has a list of vets who will take care of your ferrets and not turn you in.

798
00:55:10,596 --> 00:55:10,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

799
00:55:11,957 --> 00:55:12,958
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think that's pretty cool.

800
00:55:12,978 --> 00:55:18,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even better, that they still sell the crap for ferrets at, like, the store, but... Oh, yeah.

801
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:22,085
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, even though they're not allowed over here.

802
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:23,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Ferrets are the best pets ever.

803
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:26,829
[SPEAKER_03]: As much as I love my cat, I really want a ferret.

804
00:55:28,106 --> 00:55:31,127
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, what's going to happen when you have a cat and a ferret?

805
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:32,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to chase each other around the house?

806
00:55:32,808 --> 00:55:36,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, well, I'd love for Shermie to get chased around the house, that big fat animal.

807
00:55:37,529 --> 00:55:43,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my cat is intensely obese, and she's lazy, and I can't even chase her around the house.

808
00:55:43,951 --> 00:55:45,111
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, oh, it's just mom.

809
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:47,012
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll just step on me, and then I'll be okay.

810
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:53,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Dar Tetsuya says in chat room, chat.orangemonstrator.com, Rob Roberts reminding you to help control the ferret population.

811
00:55:53,994 --> 00:55:55,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Have your ferret spayed or neutered.

812
00:55:55,415 --> 00:55:55,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

813
00:55:56,355 --> 00:55:58,336
[SPEAKER_05]: and RossDLUT asks a good question.

814
00:55:58,717 --> 00:56:00,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually don't know the answer to it, but I'm assuming you do, DarkSakura.

815
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:02,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the fuck are ferrets illegal in California?

816
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,962
[SPEAKER_03]: That's... Okay, I don't know the entire thing.

817
00:56:07,582 --> 00:56:10,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually haven't seen anything legitimate about it.

818
00:56:11,725 --> 00:56:19,250
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're talking about some problem with certain breeds of them being endangered and with having this...

819
00:56:20,249 --> 00:56:22,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild Ferret Population from Strays.

820
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:23,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that's stupid.

821
00:56:24,151 --> 00:56:24,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you why.

822
00:56:25,112 --> 00:56:27,053
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because of Beastmaster.

823
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:35,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they don't want another one of those crappy movies made in California, so... No ferrets, no Beastmaster sequel.

824
00:56:36,138 --> 00:56:36,678
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

825
00:56:37,218 --> 00:56:40,320
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend... Before I moved out here, my friend was... At least not another sequel.

826
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:46,123
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend was going to give me his ferrets, and their names were Koto and Poto.

827
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:50,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm on Wikipedia, of course, to find the answer to this question.

828
00:56:50,617 --> 00:56:52,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm on ferretnews.org.

829
00:56:52,198 --> 00:57:13,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the ferret article, it cites this reference, the Fish and Game Code of California, and what it says, quote, animals of the families Vivuridae, I'm sorry, I'm totally mispronouncing these, and Mustelidae, which I'm assuming the ferrets belong to, in the order Carnivora are restricted because such animals are undesirable and a menace to native wildlife, the agricultural interest of the state...

830
00:57:15,476 --> 00:57:16,957
[SPEAKER_05]: or to the public health or safety.

831
00:57:46,328 --> 00:57:54,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but then you're going to get those stupid people that let the ferrets run loose outdoors like a fucking cat and it's going to kill things and screw up the ecosystem.

832
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,951
[SPEAKER_02]: A cat can take a ferret.

833
00:57:56,231 --> 00:57:59,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that ferrets shouldn't be outside.

834
00:57:59,632 --> 00:58:01,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally oblivious to that.

835
00:58:01,392 --> 00:58:04,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, they ruin it for everybody.

836
00:58:05,853 --> 00:58:07,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why we're talking about ferrets on a video game show.

837
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:09,554
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Orange Lounge.

838
00:58:09,594 --> 00:58:10,595
[SPEAKER_05]: We have ferrets, okay?

839
00:58:11,535 --> 00:58:11,915
[SPEAKER_05]: A ferret.

840
00:58:11,935 --> 00:58:13,755
[SPEAKER_05]: The ferret's in the box somewhere right now.

841
00:58:14,316 --> 00:58:15,656
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a ferret in the studio yet.

842
00:58:16,604 --> 00:58:20,725
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I really, really, really, really want a ferret.

843
00:58:21,045 --> 00:58:26,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm working on trying to get my significant other to agree.

844
00:58:26,307 --> 00:58:28,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I really, really want to get back into gaming news.

845
00:58:29,648 --> 00:58:33,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to answer, son of dad ferrets live anywhere between 10 to 15 years.

846
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:36,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

847
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:38,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so...

848
00:58:39,381 --> 00:58:40,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting stuff.

849
00:58:41,242 --> 00:58:43,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I guess a decent game for the iPod.

850
00:58:43,804 --> 00:58:44,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, wait a minute.

851
00:58:44,824 --> 00:58:47,306
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in chat has a great point.

852
00:58:47,966 --> 00:58:49,447
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no ferret video games.

853
00:58:49,987 --> 00:58:50,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, ever.

854
00:58:50,507 --> 00:58:51,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's fix that!

855
00:58:51,548 --> 00:58:53,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Has there ever been a ferret video game?

856
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:53,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever?

857
00:58:53,849 --> 00:58:54,029
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

858
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,651
[SPEAKER_05]: In existence, has a ferret even been a character in a video game?

859
00:58:57,491 --> 00:58:58,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Beastmaster.

860
00:58:58,172 --> 00:58:59,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot... Besides Beastmaster...

861
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:05,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't think of anything where a... This is a travesty!

862
00:59:05,488 --> 00:59:06,729
[SPEAKER_05]: 2DX16, Ferret.

863
00:59:06,829 --> 00:59:07,129
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

864
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:13,053
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to have a game... Okay, now that's... 2DX Troopers, that's bullshit.

865
00:59:13,093 --> 00:59:16,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put that up on the Orange Lounge Radio Xbox Live Arcade wish list.

866
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:21,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we have Laser Cats, the game, and now we have Ferret, the video game.

867
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:21,959
[SPEAKER_05]: What, Loki?

868
00:59:23,148 --> 00:59:28,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, there has been a ferret video game for the Game Boy Color created by Culture Brain.

869
00:59:28,554 --> 00:59:34,640
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Ferret Monogatari Watashi no Okini Iri.

870
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:35,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Big what?

871
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:39,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, Ferret Story, My Dear Ferret.

872
00:59:39,745 --> 00:59:45,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Japanese-only video game that's a simulation-style game where you take care of a ferret.

873
00:59:45,869 --> 00:59:48,191
[SPEAKER_04]: At the start of the game, choose one of three different colored ferrets.

874
00:59:48,211 --> 00:59:49,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Colors are randomly chosen.

875
00:59:49,772 --> 00:59:56,097
[SPEAKER_04]: The ferret is kept in the cage a bunch of the time, but you have to keep his water and food topped off and clean its litter box.

876
00:59:56,137 --> 00:59:58,819
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take the ferret out for walks or to play with it.

877
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:01,229
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also even play minigames.

878
01:00:01,369 --> 01:00:04,310
[SPEAKER_04]: One is a race, one is putting together a picture, and the other is dancing.

879
01:00:04,510 --> 01:00:05,430
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Nintendogs.

880
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:09,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and just like Nintendogs, the game gets fucking boring after playing it for an hour.

881
01:00:09,631 --> 01:00:10,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting the ferret game.

882
01:00:11,131 --> 01:00:11,691
[SPEAKER_05]: You watch.

883
01:00:11,772 --> 01:00:12,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

884
01:00:12,172 --> 01:00:14,212
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a lot of comments in chat here on the ferret game.

885
01:00:14,932 --> 01:00:17,733
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says, There's a ferret-like creature in Pokemon.

886
01:00:18,613 --> 01:00:19,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really a ferret.

887
01:00:19,733 --> 01:00:24,154
[SPEAKER_05]: TheRobD says, Was there a ferret in Bible Adventures or in Super 3D Noah's Ark?

888
01:00:24,534 --> 01:00:26,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not because ferrets are unclean.

889
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:27,315
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not God's animals.

890
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:28,135
So...

891
01:00:30,015 --> 01:00:31,176
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't allowed on the Ark.

892
01:00:31,716 --> 01:00:32,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Like lice.

893
01:00:32,517 --> 01:00:34,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Noah took lice on the Ark.

894
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:34,517
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

895
01:00:34,537 --> 01:00:35,398
[SPEAKER_02]: The lice were in their hair.

896
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:38,979
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have rid back in the day.

897
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:39,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

898
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,220
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

899
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,261
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a bastard anyway.

900
01:00:42,361 --> 01:00:43,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't vote for him.

901
01:00:43,141 --> 01:00:44,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I voted for Gary Coleman.

902
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:56,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I voted for Mary Carey.

903
01:00:57,283 --> 01:01:00,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Bandit says there was a ferret in a video game called Penguin Wars for the Game Boy.

904
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would a ferret be in a penguin game?

905
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:06,005
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

906
01:01:07,685 --> 01:01:07,965
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

907
01:01:08,065 --> 01:01:08,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Loki.

908
01:01:09,746 --> 01:01:11,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Please put the show back on track if you can.

909
01:01:11,866 --> 01:01:15,127
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this news website that has a character that they talk about.

910
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:16,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a video game news site.

911
01:01:16,607 --> 01:01:18,088
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Toothpick the Ferret.

912
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,228
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a giant cloud sword.

913
01:01:20,528 --> 01:01:22,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so yeah.

914
01:01:23,755 --> 01:01:24,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Music Cuts, Parappa the Rapper

915
01:01:32,554 --> 01:02:00,370
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's a game that's basically a musical music visualizer game more background I guess than anything and I guess when the game creates visuals based on the titles of your songs and then asks players to tap the center button in time with each letter of the name and you get points for doing that and build up your combo yada yada yada so if you were interested in buying it it's $4.99 on the iTunes store

916
01:02:03,151 --> 01:02:03,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I might have to check that out.

917
01:02:22,836 --> 01:02:28,340
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw, I hate to go back to the ferret thing, but the chat room just won't shut up about it, which is what I love about having a chat room.

918
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:33,283
[SPEAKER_05]: HitStun says, Hotaru Fukuba from Garou Mark of the Wolves had a yellow ferret.

919
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:36,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I found the game online, but it's a Flash game.

920
01:02:38,307 --> 01:02:39,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what else is there.

921
01:02:39,688 --> 01:02:46,892
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says, if Nintendo or Sega is listening, they have a potential franchise if they create Sonic the Hedgehog type game starring a ferret.

922
01:02:47,413 --> 01:02:47,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

923
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Beatmania 2DX

924
01:03:02,762 --> 01:03:08,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Beatmania, now in 2DX, and it's 15th in creation, is now being location tested.

925
01:03:09,004 --> 01:03:11,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called DJ Troopers, is the new theme.

926
01:03:12,284 --> 01:03:18,186
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a silly name, but of course, a lot of people thought Red and Happy Sky were dumb names too, so.

927
01:03:18,206 --> 01:03:22,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Sky made sense, at least it was very, you know, English-y.

928
01:03:22,647 --> 01:03:30,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, DJ Troopers, I give it a chance, because it's kind of green, like camo colors are kind of green, so that's one color they haven't really done yet, so, I give it a chance.

929
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,831
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the cutest thing ever.

930
01:03:33,712 --> 01:03:39,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Beatmania 2 DX has not really changed a whole lot over the past few games.

931
01:03:39,616 --> 01:03:43,278
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, little subtle changes here and there, but the game itself hasn't changed a whole lot.

932
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:49,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it has been location tested, or is going through location tests in Tokyo right now, and some of the songs are sneaking out.

933
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:54,947
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new song from Chorus K called Evergreen, a new song from Akira Yamaoka called Shift.

934
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:57,028
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a techno song, should be fun.

935
01:03:57,728 --> 01:04:00,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Another remix of A is in the game, which should be interesting.

936
01:04:01,489 --> 01:04:04,550
[SPEAKER_05]: New songs, of course, are green colored in the song list.

937
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:15,854
[SPEAKER_05]: The five keys modifier now uses keys three through seven instead of one through five when playing on the two player side, which is kind of a different type of change there for those that like to play five key mode.

938
01:04:17,254 --> 01:04:19,555
[SPEAKER_05]: And a song called Deep Strikers.

939
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:27,002
[SPEAKER_05]: has 1,528 notes on Hyper and is a 12 rated song on Double Hyper.

940
01:04:27,082 --> 01:04:28,623
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be crazy.

941
01:04:29,163 --> 01:04:30,944
[SPEAKER_05]: They got rid of a bunch of songs, by the way.

942
01:04:31,445 --> 01:04:33,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Bag is finally no longer in 2DX.

943
01:04:33,026 --> 01:04:33,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

944
01:04:33,146 --> 01:04:34,687
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

945
01:04:35,207 --> 01:04:37,769
[SPEAKER_05]: But also sad, Diamond Jealousy is also gone finally.

946
01:04:38,089 --> 01:04:38,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Boo!

947
01:04:38,269 --> 01:04:38,810
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of sad.

948
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:40,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

949
01:04:40,311 --> 01:04:46,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we'll be hearing more about this on your favorite music gaming website as the week goes on and more stuff comes out of Location Test.

950
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:49,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure YouTubes are coming far behind.

951
01:04:50,063 --> 01:04:54,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have some happy that I hope would be something that happens.

952
01:04:55,686 --> 01:05:03,210
[SPEAKER_03]: There is actually a hint about there being a downloadable sequel on PSN for Parappa.

953
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:07,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just be so happy to have more Parappa.

954
01:05:07,932 --> 01:05:10,193
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now it's in rumor phase.

955
01:05:11,134 --> 01:05:14,996
[SPEAKER_03]: The creator of Parappa the Rapper just sort of talked about it, not really.

956
01:05:15,016 --> 01:05:16,377
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, oh yeah, let's just do it.

957
01:05:17,437 --> 01:05:19,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck Parappa, I want Umjama Lammy.

958
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:20,750
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool.

959
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:24,131
[SPEAKER_05]: How come we always hear about Parappa this, Parappa that?

960
01:05:24,391 --> 01:05:30,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Parappa remake, Parappa going to be on the PlayStation Network maybe, but there ain't shit about Umjamalami.

961
01:05:30,433 --> 01:05:31,793
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Umjam or Death Metal.

962
01:05:33,574 --> 01:05:34,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what was it?

963
01:05:34,714 --> 01:05:37,175
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Umjamalami and then Rami was her friend, right?

964
01:05:37,275 --> 01:05:37,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Rami.

965
01:05:37,895 --> 01:05:39,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Rami was her opposite.

966
01:05:39,716 --> 01:05:42,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think it sucks because I wanted the hell level.

967
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:44,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead they put him on an island.

968
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:53,477
[SPEAKER_05]: and RustyLUT theorizes maybe it's because Unjamalami sucked, but that would be a lie because Unjamalami was awesome.

969
01:05:53,557 --> 01:05:55,338
[SPEAKER_05]: So I failed to see your logic.

970
01:05:55,378 --> 01:05:55,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

971
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:57,219
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you have it.

972
01:05:58,379 --> 01:06:08,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I suppose, though, if the Parappa thing did come out for the PlayStation Network and it sold like crazy, maybe we could convince them to do an Unjamalami song in-game.

973
01:06:08,485 --> 01:06:08,705
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

974
01:06:09,355 --> 01:06:16,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyhow, that's going to bring this segment of Orange Lounge Radio to a close, but we will be back with Part B right after a quick break.

975
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:22,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

976
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:26,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
