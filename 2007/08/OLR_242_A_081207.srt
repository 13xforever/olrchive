1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,760
Is the Xbox 360 Core on its way out?

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,640
New details on Super Mario Galaxy, and is it really possible to now play NES games on

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
your iPhone?

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,640
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,280
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,600
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,760
lifestyle.

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,120
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be here with you all night long, as will my lovely co-host,

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,880
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
Hi.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,880
And how are you doing, Jamie?

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,640
Uh, full of burrito.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,640
Mmm, yummy burrito.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
Shrimpy burritos.

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,080
Just shrimp?

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
No red meat tonight?

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,680
No, I'm not going to be eating red meat anymore.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,320
Are you going on one of those funky diet things?

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,680
Well, out of necessity, I can't.

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,400
Every so often, I get to where I can't actually eat it very safely.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Oh.

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,040
Because I was going to say, you can't have diet without dye.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,040
I don't diet.

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,680
I have lifestyle adjustments.

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,240
I see.

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
That's a clever little work-around.

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,600
Alright, also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,760
So would a funky diet be like pizza and disco or something?

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,600
I mean, would that be a funky diet?

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,360
Would that be eating dirty food?

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Why?

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
Is that what your life is like right now?

34
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,360
No.

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
Disco and pizza?

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,480
Yes, everything's all disco and pizza.

37
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,200
Whatever happened to discos?

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,640
You know, my mom still calls clubs discos.

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
The discotheque.

40
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
No.

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,640
I'm doing okay.

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
Alright.

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Well, I had pizza.

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
You had pizza?

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Yes.

46
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Was it good pizza?

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
Yes.

48
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
So I'm halfway there on the diet.

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Alright.

50
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Yeah, fully commit on the funky diet.

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,120
Well, I say welcome back because obviously we were off two weeks ago and then last week

52
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,480
was kind of a weird show because we were at Studio Loki, which was a temporary setup.

53
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,500
We are kind of in the new studio now.

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,320
We're not out in the garage, which is where we want to be, where we're going to have the

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,440
retro gaming setup and the webcam and everything, just because we don't have the air conditioning

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,480
yet out there and it's too hot.

57
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,240
So we're in the little studio, but the good news is we're back on the normal computers

58
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,560
and the normal network setup and all that good stuff, so the sound of the show should

59
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,240
be pretty much what you guys are used to, at least I hope.

60
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,160
Save some minor echo and probably things you probably can't even really hear on your iPods.

61
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,720
So we're happy to be back.

62
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,480
And also we're happy to have you back, Jamie.

63
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,360
And I know a lot of folks were thinking about you last week, so I hope everything was okay.

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,160
It was interesting.

65
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Alright.

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,040
Well, we'll leave it at that.

67
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,880
Let's talk about games instead and talk about your interesting experience at California

68
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
Extreme.

69
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
You just got back from yesterday.

70
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
Yes.

71
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
At two in the morning.

72
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
Oh my God.

73
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,600
What exactly is California Extreme?

74
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,000
It's a pinball and classic gaming convention of sorts.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,960
They had an auction there, but as far as I know, it wasn't actually part of California

76
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Extreme.

77
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,880
But I did play a whole crap ton of games and finally beat Space Harrier.

78
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,880
I saw your LJ post about beating Space Harrier.

79
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,520
I sure did.

80
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,720
It was fantastic.

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,000
I forgot that it just says the end.

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,720
So they just get a bunch of random games together and call it an expo?

83
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,240
Yeah, some of them are for sale.

84
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Oh, okay.

85
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Well, that's pretty cool.

86
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,760
Big Bang Bar, which was the first thing I went right to, I ran into, well, actually

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,040
I met up with Mel and Melody and the first thing that she and I did was go right up and

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,160
play Big Bang Bar, which was one of the last machines Capcom made.

89
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,760
But they only had about 16 prototypes and now there's production models of them.

90
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,920
Well, I should say reproduction models.

91
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:56,060
But the one that we played was a legitimate prototype and then it was just mostly wandering

92
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,680
around and she was playing Star Wars.

93
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,760
I got to play Ultra Pin, which was kind of interesting.

94
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,080
It's Ultra Cade's answer to pinball.

95
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,720
Oh, I think you talked about this on the show once.

96
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,160
Isn't it like they used an LCD but laid flat instead?

97
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Yeah.

98
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
How does that work?

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Is it good?

100
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
It was interesting.

101
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,120
The perspective kind of messed with my head a little bit.

102
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,160
I played Black Knight 2000 on it, which was pretty cool.

103
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,480
And then I was like, screw this, I went to play a real Black Knight 2000.

104
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,800
I was like, woohoo, Black Knight.

105
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,160
Now, did they bring any developers to this show or is there anybody like, you know, game

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
famous or whatever?

107
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Or is it just...

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,560
I didn't go to any of the panels because I was like, dude, pinball.

109
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
So they do have live panels and some things.

110
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,560
They did not have a pinbot, Rob.

111
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Or a jackpot.

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Cry and Sadness.

113
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Do they have Bride of...

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Well, you have Bride of Pinbot in your house.

115
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
I have Bride.

116
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
No, they didn't have that.

117
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,760
You're so badass, by the way.

118
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,400
I played Vortex, which is one of the mid-80s.

119
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Oh, I remember Vortex.

120
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
That's a cool one.

121
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
But I played one of the best tables ever.

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
It's called Airborne.

123
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,560
It's one of Capcom's.

124
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
It's all ramps.

125
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,120
It's all ramps.

126
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,160
It's just a bajillion ramps everywhere and it was fun and they had it on like a bajillion

127
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
buy-ins.

128
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,700
It was crazy.

129
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,880
So did you play anything besides Space Harrier and pinball?

130
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Words.

131
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,800
Yes, I did.

132
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,180
I didn't play Journey.

133
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,180
They got Journey working.

134
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,180
They had Journey?

135
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,180
Yes.

136
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,180
Oh my god, I should have gone.

137
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,200
I was trying to go but I couldn't because I had other stuff going on.

138
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
What else did I play?

139
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,320
Oh, what I would give to play a Journey arcade machine.

140
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
I played Mappy.

141
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Huh.

142
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,320
I played...

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,860
Well, Julie played a bunch of Crystal Castles.

144
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,760
Every time I ran into her, she's either playing Crystal Castles or Pac-Man.

145
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,720
They had a Tapper, Rob, that someone had messed with the sprites and it was all Simpsons characters.

146
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Well, that's weird.

147
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,720
And Mo was the bartender.

148
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,440
That's pretty cool.

149
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,960
And they had, I played SVC Chaos because I had to get my fighting game on and I played

150
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,720
some X-Men vs. Street Fighter so I could use the most annoying team ever.

151
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,560
See, Dan and I, when we first got together, we played a whole crap ton of that game on

152
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,280
Saturn and I used to always have this one combo that would just piss him off and annoy

153
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,540
him so much that he would just quit.

154
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,480
And that was Cammy and Gambit.

155
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,760
Note to everybody, if ever you play against my husband, Cammy and Gambit, he will get

156
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
mad.

157
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
So, anyway.

158
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,160
I played a few other things, though.

159
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,120
I played some Dig Dug.

160
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,680
I had Dig Dug.

161
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
That was cool.

162
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
They had a sit-down Star Wars.

163
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,880
They had an Empire Strikes Back arcade machine, which was really cool.

164
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,480
They had Discs of Tron.

165
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Rad.

166
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,880
They had Tron.

167
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,960
Not a lot of new stuff, though.

168
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
It's all retro stuff.

169
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Oh, yeah.

170
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
It's all retro.

171
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I remember there was one year...

172
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Oh!

173
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
They had Panic Park.

174
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
What the hell is that?

175
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
I've never heard of that.

176
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Panic Park is this great game.

177
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,520
I think they have one at Milpitas Golf Land where there's a big one and then there's a

178
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
small one.

179
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,520
They had an actual Japanese one there, but they had the bad Engrish-y one.

180
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,920
It's a game where you have these... one person's on one side and the other person's on another.

181
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,920
You have to play with another person and you have a big stick and it slides around.

182
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,340
You are competing with somebody in mini-games and it's best however many out of however

183
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:15,120
many and you push them aside or they push you aside using this big stick when you're

184
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,680
like grabbing hula hoops as they come from the ground or grabbing coins or jumping from

185
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,440
thing to thing or avoiding hammers falling on you.

186
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,040
I have never heard of this.

187
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,680
It's fantastic.

188
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,800
And I've actually played with Dan's buddy, Will, and Will is really strong, okay?

189
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,320
So I had a hard time.

190
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,520
We ended up... he won two matches, I won two matches, and we had a draw of three matches

191
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,080
so we actually had a perfect draw game.

192
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,120
I gotta read some comments from chat because your comments on old gaming is sparking a

193
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,200
lot of discussion in chat and of course since I haven't introduced them yet, say hello to

194
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,040
our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com and let's see, we have GS68 says, I was at

195
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,520
Milpitas Golf Land on Thursday, I don't remember seeing a game like that so maybe it wasn't

196
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
there.

197
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Maybe it was at Sunnyvale or something.

198
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,200
Kevin DDR says, Oh my God, Panic Park, hell yeah.

199
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,160
So somebody knows what you're talking about there.

200
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,680
Sakura Max says, He's confused, he's the youngest guy so he doesn't know about these old ass

201
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
games.

202
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Well, it's time to learn.

203
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,040
It's time to step up and learn.

204
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,080
Dude, just, okay, whenever you go to an arcade, all you have to do is just look around and

205
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
look for the older stuff.

206
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Oh, they had...

207
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Look for the games that still only cost one token.

208
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
They had cocktail machines.

209
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,520
Tons of cocktail tables.

210
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,720
And they were playing music videos and they freaking played Warrant.

211
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,380
It was great.

212
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,840
You know, the other thing I was going to say is that Xbox Live Arcade is slowly getting

213
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,200
a lot of these classic games on it.

214
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,800
I mean, you know that Tron and Distro-Tron are coming out for it.

215
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,480
Dig Dug, which you mentioned, is already on Xbox Live Arcade.

216
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,680
There are a lot of classics that are on there.

217
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,400
Sakura Max asks if GameTap would help them or not.

218
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
Probably.

219
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Probably.

220
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,320
I mean, they certainly have a collection of old stuff on there, although I've been called

221
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,080
a GameTap whore too much on this program so I don't want to sound like an advertisement.

222
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,240
They also, though, had some of the little bar top machines.

223
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,580
Oh, cool.

224
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,200
Like the little, like, what do they call it?

225
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Mega Touch and that stuff?

226
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,880
Yeah, but they were actually the ones with the controllers and everything on them.

227
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:12,000
And they had an actual Pong and they had the small child-sized machines, the SNK machines.

228
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Cool.

229
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,380
The Neo Geo one, sorry, with, like, you know, Puzzle Bobble.

230
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,360
So it sounds like you had a lot of fun and it sounds like I really missed out getting

231
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
to see Journey Machine.

232
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,760
I did get to find, though, some of my favorite old tables were there, though, like Centaur.

233
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,720
They had a Hyperball, which I refused to ever play again.

234
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Stupid fucking Hyperball.

235
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,000
And they had, um, I'm sorry, I'm trying to watch my language.

236
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's all right.

237
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,280
Watch it fly out of your mouth and offend people.

238
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Bye.

239
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
There you go, language, have fun.

240
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,680
So did you play any, like, new games this week or was it all pretty much retro gaming

241
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
goodness?

242
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,560
Um, I played the Ultra Pin.

243
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,800
All right.

244
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,120
That's technically new.

245
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:03,880
I played DDR, I played Max 2.

246
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,040
That is kind of old school as well.

247
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,880
I played Cowgirl in flip flops.

248
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
All right.

249
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,480
It was fun, it was actually kind of funny, I was like, dude, I am going to fall over

250
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
and I didn't.

251
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
It was great.

252
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,720
All right, well, next year the dude with the Journey Machine needs to come back to California

253
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,520
Extreme so I can play it, or I'll be sad.

254
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,360
But my World Cup soccer is almost, um, fixed up nice.

255
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Oh!

256
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,920
This is what pisses me off, it's not really an F-you, it's just a, huh?

257
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,680
The one Theater of Magic they had, and the entire place was at the tournament area.

258
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,000
Unless you pay to do the stupid tournament and you can't play the Theater of Magic, I'm

259
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
like, uh-huh!

260
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Theater of Magic!

261
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Theater of Magic's a pretty bad-ass revelation.

262
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I did play the Devil's Madness, though.

263
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,040
I knocked down the castle, it was great.

264
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,160
All right, we've got to move on, but it sounds like you've got a lot of good gaming in, even

265
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,120
if most of it was pinball, not console games.

266
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Pinball!

267
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
Pinball's pretty rad.

268
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

269
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,760
Um, it was okay.

270
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,360
Before I get into my gaming week, though, I wanted to talk about, there was this game

271
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,680
that I saw that was coming out later.

272
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,400
Now, you know, I dogged Neo Geo, or not Neo Geo, SNK for Never coming up with new games.

273
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,920
This actually sounds pretty cool, and I think we talked about it a little bit before, Neo

274
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,480
Geo Battle Colosseum.

275
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,840
It's a fighting game that features, like, an ensemble cast of all the past Neo Geo games,

276
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,280
including King of Fighters, Fatal Fury, Mark of the Wolves, Samurai Shodown, Art of Fighting,

277
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:31,400
Last Blade, King of the Monsters, World Heroes, Athena, Aggressors of Dark Combat, Kizuna,

278
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,960
Tag Battle, and Metal Slug.

279
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,760
Dude, you said Last Blade, and that makes me happy.

280
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,680
Wait, so you could have, like, my fighting one of the monsters from King of Monsters?

281
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,280
And if I remember correctly, this isn't being published every year by SNK, but it is coming

282
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,920
out in October, and I think it's cheap, and it's on PlayStation 2, so that seemed pretty

283
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
cool.

284
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Anyways, I just thought that was neat.

285
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,440
Now, actually, the games that I played this week, I played the demo for Stranglehold,

286
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,600
which was actually pretty fun.

287
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,200
It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be, with a lot of running around,

288
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,240
flying through the air, shooting things in slow-mo, so that's pretty cool.

289
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,080
And then I also tried the Fatal Inertia demo, which, you know, I've been really hyped up

290
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,320
about the game ever since they first announced it, because they reminded me of, like, you

291
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,760
know, kind of like F-Zero GX or something like that, you know, a combat racing game.

292
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,160
That was not the case with this.

293
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,820
This is crap.

294
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,200
And I, thank God I played the demo, because I'm not buying the game now.

295
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,440
It's just, it's hard to control, and it didn't seem that fast, and, I don't know, I just

296
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,860
didn't like the level layout, it wasn't pretty enough for me, so, oh well.

297
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:44,900
And then, let's see, I also played 300 on the PSP, because I had just watched the Blu-ray

298
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,720
for it, so, that game sucks also.

299
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
But what do you expect?

300
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Why?

301
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
It's just a hack and slash game.

302
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
It's like a movie tie-in game.

303
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,800
Well, that's not what the movie was?

304
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
I don't know, I didn't see the movie, so.

305
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,440
Yeah, well the movie was a lot better than that, so.

306
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,660
I'm the one guy that didn't see 300.

307
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,760
And then, I've been playing, actually, strangely enough, well, Overlord have been playing,

308
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,640
and that game's still really fun.

309
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,280
I've also been playing, this is going to be really weird, Cellars of Catan, actually.

310
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:23,160
And because I got hooked on this yesterday, actually, I was playing the actual board game

311
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,720
with my sister and her boyfriend, and it's really fun.

312
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,320
So I bought the Xbox Live Arcade game, and it's pretty much the same thing, except the

313
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,440
AI's completely cheap, but other than that, the only thing I really wish it had was local

314
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,640
multiplayer instead of just over live.

315
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,440
That would be pretty cool, but, you know, they didn't, so.

316
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,400
But this game has passed the wife test, right?

317
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Oh yeah, the wife is probably playing it right now, actually.

318
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
That's amazing.

319
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,520
Yeah, she was playing it all afternoon, so.

320
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,440
Does she have her own gamertag?

321
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,720
So like, you could use my Xbox 360 over here and then play your wife.

322
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,440
No, she's still playing, she's playing under my gamertag right now, so.

323
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,840
Yeah, I think that's pretty much all I've been playing, you know, Grand Theft Auto by

324
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,560
City Stories, of course, and still very disappointed about Grand Theft Auto IV not coming out until

325
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
next year.

326
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Grand Theft Auto IV still played the PSP version for a long time.

327
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Cry me a river.

328
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Cry me a river.

329
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,840
Alright, somebody in chat earlier, and I apologize, I forgot who said it, somebody had said, what's

330
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,880
more funny than watching Grand Theft Auto IV get delayed is watching everything else

331
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,700
back out of its way now that it's been delayed, everything else is getting delayed because

332
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
of that.

333
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,280
There's other games that have all kind of moved out of, like the ripple effect that

334
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,840
Grand Theft Auto is having.

335
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,720
Kind of interesting.

336
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,800
Looking at the chat room and talking about some quotes there.

337
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,520
What is it that Rob D. said that was really funny?

338
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,800
Oh, about the Battle Coliseum game and how I said Mai could fight one of the King of

339
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
the Monsters.

340
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,940
Sky just wants to see Mai versus a tentacle monster, let's face it, that quote coming

341
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,960
from the Rob D. Let's see, apparently the Rob D. didn't see 300 either, so I guess I'm

342
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,720
not the only one ever.

343
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,680
Let's see, what else is there?

344
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,200
Ross Deal UT impersonates Loki, duh, I'm going to play this movie game, maybe it'll suck

345
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,680
less than all the others.

346
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,480
I suppose saying that all movie games usually suck.

347
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
One thing that's usually a pretty common thing.

348
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,200
For the most part they do, I mean there's some movie games that are okay.

349
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,680
I remember like some of the NES Batman games weren't that bad.

350
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,080
Oh yeah, that's true.

351
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,980
And I actually liked the Friday the 13th game.

352
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,240
It always ends up on these worst NES games of all times list, but that game actually

353
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,120
scared me when I was a kid, because it was kind of a scary game, I don't know, anyway.

354
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,160
But yeah, movie games usually not so much fun.

355
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,760
Let's see, games I've been playing this week.

356
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,880
Not a lot of new stuff unfortunately, I've been on World of Warcraft, I'm really grinding

357
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,200
like hell in World of Warcraft to try and get my character to level 70, so I'll be all

358
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,200
ready by the time the next expansion comes out, and also the fact is that I know all

359
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,160
these console games are coming out very soon, like especially when we get into the end of

360
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,840
August, Blue Dragon, Eternal Sonata, Halo, and then Metro Prime 3 and all these games

361
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,220
I'm going to want to be playing are all coming out soon, so I want to get as much grinding

362
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,220
in as I can before I get distracted by the console games.

363
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,040
So most of my week has been spent on the PC playing WoW, otherwise though I have been

364
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,240
playing some other console games, I was playing Kingdom Hearts 2 more, and I finally surpassed

365
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,920
my first save game, so I guess that's kind of cool.

366
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,040
Otherwise I checked out, because I was without internet for a little while, because if you

367
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,800
listen to last week's show, Comcast finally didn't come out here until Tuesday, and by

368
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,720
the way, let me say, Comcast said they were going to come in here in a window between

369
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,160
12 and 4, you know what time they finally got here?

370
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,200
7.30, 8 o'clock, it's horrible.

371
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,480
Then I would, don't you get some money or something off your bill?

372
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
We got a $20 credit.

373
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Whoopee!

374
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Whoopee-doo!

375
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Whoopee-doo!

376
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,880
Then they installed all this shit we didn't ask for, like all the HBO and Showtime shit,

377
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,360
and channels, we didn't want that shit.

378
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,400
I mean it was cool for one night, because I got to watch Big Brother After Dark, which

379
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,500
is kind of cheesy fun, but yeah, we had to get rid of that, like they just totally screwed

380
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
up the order.

381
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,280
I'm actually surprised they remembered to put the HD in there, it's bad.

382
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,440
So yeah, otherwise my gaming week has been pretty light in that regard, just mostly World

383
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,720
of Warcraft, but I will be kicking back into high gear when we get into the end of the

384
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
month.

385
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,680
Oh, the Xbox Live Arcade games, I did catch up on all those ones I missed while I was

386
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
out.

387
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,880
I didn't care for any of them.

388
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,360
Like I just, I played like four, I didn't like the Spyglass board games, I didn't like

389
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:28,080
Super, well Super Contra was okay, I mean, you know, and Track and Field is okay, surprisingly,

390
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,400
I actually think I played Track and Field more than any of the other ones.

391
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,760
I was thinking about buying Track and Field, it just looks stupid, like it's just back

392
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,000
and forth with the analog sick, isn't it?

393
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,360
Well that, or you can use the buttons, because the actual arcade machine used buttons, like

394
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,640
giant pop and music.

395
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,600
Or you know what I suggest doing, since I think, aren't the controls completely configurable

396
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,000
and stuff like that?

397
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,400
DDR pads, man, get out the DDR pads and bust it out like Track and Field, yeah.

398
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Maybe.

399
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,040
I don't know, it's not the most thrilling game ever, but for some reason I like those

400
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,560
old retro games, so it's fun to me.

401
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,520
But I don't know if I'd actually recommend it to a lot of people, because it's certainly

402
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,880
not one of the better Konami arcade ports that's on Marketplace.

403
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,240
Anyway, let's move on and get into some housekeeping so we can get to tonight's news.

404
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,840
First off in the housekeeping tonight, podcast award voting is closed, so you can no longer

405
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,960
vote for us, but we appreciate anybody that voted for us, we won't know the results till

406
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,440
later and, I don't know, we probably won't win, and it's okay if we don't, you know,

407
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
whatever.

408
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
It was nice to be nominated.

409
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Exactly.

410
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,120
Because especially after last year when we weren't nominated, we were like, did we do

411
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
something wrong?

412
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,120
But it was cool, so.

413
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,280
Why don't they call us in the morning?

414
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
Why don't you call me anymore?

415
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,280
But yeah, they nominated like ten shows this year, which is great, but that's a lot of

416
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,560
competition, so I wouldn't expect that we win, but if we do, awesome.

417
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,200
But moving on, we are featured on Joystiq's podcast rodeo this week, which was kind of

418
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,060
hilarious because, you know, we've been doing this show for, you know, years and years,

419
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:03,500
and they highlighted us this week as kind of like, they were mentioning all the podcasts

420
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,240
they had that week, and they had themselves, because Joystiq does their own podcast, but

421
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,960
they're a little bit irregular, but I guess they did two weeks in a row, so they were

422
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,400
nominating themselves for having done two weeks in a row, like saying hooray for us,

423
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,520
and then they followed up with us and saying, well, now we have these guys who've been doing

424
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
it for years and years.

425
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,840
So that was just kind of funny.

426
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,480
So we appreciate the plug, but it's hilarious that it happened the week that our show was

427
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,380
like totally broken, and like Jamie wasn't even here, and then we had all the sound issues

428
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,380
we had last week.

429
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
It was just nuts.

430
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,900
And what the listeners couldn't see last week is I was also trying to read stories while

431
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,040
keeping the spaghetti away from my cat, because I had a plate of spaghetti, and she kept trying

432
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,800
to attack the plate.

433
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,560
The sound was so horrible last week, and then for some reason, there was like little packet

434
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,200
losses throughout the file, so like suddenly you'd be, and then the words would drop out.

435
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
It was bad.

436
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,600
Because my computer sucks.

437
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,440
Luckily, it didn't just reset on us all of a sudden, because it's been doing that lately.

438
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,760
I have to replace the motherboard, something's going out on it, so.

439
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,840
It was better than nothing at all, though, right?

440
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,680
It's an old PC, it needs to be upgraded anyway, so, no, we'll not get an iMac.

441
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,480
We went to the Apple store yesterday, oh my God, I felt, I almost felt like I was going

442
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,880
to burst into flames, you know.

443
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,840
You know, we almost had a webcam tonight, but I just didn't get it set up in time.

444
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,160
But you, speaking of Apple, my little Apple webcam and the laptop, so I can have it wherever,

445
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,720
but we're going to wait until we move out to the garage to do that, so it'll be fun.

446
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,000
You know who else likes that seller is a catan?

447
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What's that?

448
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,960
She'll sit there in front of the TV and watch the dice move and the cards move and stuff.

449
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,040
Just completely fascinated by it.

450
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
It's awesome.

451
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,380
Alright, let's get into some gaming news for tonight, so we can make fun of what's going

452
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,600
on in the gaming industry right now.

453
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,520
We're not going to make fun, we're going to talk about it in intelligent discussion.

454
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Sure.

455
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,080
Okay, so there's a rumor going around that Target, among other stores, are going to be

456
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,880
discontinuing the Xbox 360 core model.

457
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:05,380
Now, as I mentioned in the last week, I kind of theorized that this might be happening,

458
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,560
although I don't think it's any time soon that it's going to happen.

459
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,680
But the theory behind it is, other than the fact that it is showing discontinuity in their

460
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:18,720
system, is that they're replacing all of the current premium systems out there with the

461
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,480
ones with HDMI, but they're not doing that with the core system.

462
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,280
So people are thinking, okay, well they're going to just sell out the core system and

463
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,400
then discontinue it.

464
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,580
I don't know.

465
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,180
Did Microsoft maybe do something to Target?

466
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,520
Because I noticed Target, also, aren't they phasing out HD DVDs?

467
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,200
Like I seem to remember that was a previous report.

468
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,640
I think it was Target that was doing that.

469
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,720
Well, they're phasing them out of their store, but if you've ever gone into Target looking

470
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:50,280
for HD product anyways, their shelving that they have is literally maybe 12 movies that

471
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
they have there.

472
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,960
Blu-ray and HD DVD combined.

473
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,720
Yeah, I wouldn't exactly consider Target my number one stop for HD DVD purchasing.

474
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
It's only in store.

475
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,000
I think they have them still on the website.

476
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,280
It's a little disheartening, though, to see HD DVDs be phased out when I spent as much

477
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,320
money as I did on the HD player for the 360.

478
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,320
It's all numbers.

479
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:17,240
If their Blu-ray product is selling and their HD is not, then it's better for them to stock

480
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,500
more Blu-ray product than HD.

481
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,240
Of course, then again, my purchase will be completely justified once Heroes season one

482
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,160
comes out on HD DVD, so I don't mind.

483
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,280
Because that's when I finally bought the HD DVD player when I heard Heroes was coming

484
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
out on HD DVD.

485
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
I was like, oh, gotta have it.

486
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
So, we'll see.

487
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,040
And then, hopefully, with season two or something, they'll do it where you can download the episodes

488
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,220
right after they air.

489
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,040
That would be awesome.

490
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:45,240
Well, Target isn't the only place that's phasing out the Xbox 360 core model according to some

491
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,840
rumors out there right now.

492
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,720
And the other store that is phasing them out, Best Buy.

493
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,680
Best Buy, as apparently a little screenshot has come out of their system, has shown that

494
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:02,040
the status of the Xbox 360 core hardware in their system was deleted on July 29, 2007.

495
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,720
So Microsoft denies that there's any type of core production being stocked.

496
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,480
Microsoft says nothing has really changed since the way things were a couple weeks ago,

497
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,960
but it's very interesting that now two stores in a row have kind of come out saying they're

498
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,240
not going to do these cores anymore.

499
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,600
Well, if you remember with the 28 system, and this also could be a numbers thing, before

500
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,200
with the 28 system, stores were just not carrying them because people weren't buying them.

501
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,040
So now, maybe people aren't really buying the core model anymore and they want to save

502
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,780
inventory space or make room on the shelves for more premium systems, more elites and

503
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,780
stuff like that.

504
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,480
And then eventually, if this catches on widespread, then they'll eventually get rid of the core

505
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,000
model altogether.

506
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,440
Or it actually is something coming from Microsoft saying, hey, we're getting rid of the core

507
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,120
model.

508
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,400
I don't think that's actually been announced yet, so if that is going to happen, it probably

509
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,360
won't happen until after Christmas.

510
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,800
Wow, lots and lots of comments from chat on this one.

511
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,680
DJ Dark Knight says Sears has never had the core models.

512
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,800
Of course, I don't know a lot of people that do their gaming purchases at Sears, but I

513
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,400
suppose somebody must because they're in the gaming business.

514
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,920
My thought was always that they should, now that they're dropping the price of the system

515
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,760
or something, just include the 64 meg memory unit with it.

516
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,000
Then the people can say, okay, well I can buy this system and have something to save

517
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
on.

518
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,800
Raven's Dolphin says, when Walmart says no more cores 360s, then it's done.

519
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,280
Ross Steel UT says, of course Microsoft would deny.

520
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,400
They probably also denied that the core only counts for maybe 20% of their sales.

521
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Bandit says they should keep the core for people who want to upgrade their memory later

522
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,400
on.

523
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
It'll be more accessible to everyone.

524
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,560
I don't think they were going to announce the HDMI thing either until it leaked out,

525
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,100
so I don't know.

526
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,400
If you want to join our chat room and give your comments, if you're listening live here

527
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,120
on this Sunday night when we tape live, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

528
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,720
By the way, some other chatters following up on the whole Target, HD DVD thing, GS191

529
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,880
says this, Target is not getting rid of HD DVD.

530
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,220
The Blu-ray camp just inked a deal for their product to be displayed more through the end

531
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,220
of the year.

532
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:12,640
I think Harold follows that up with a web link that says that's true, so very interesting.

533
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:23,280
Honestly, myself, being that I've got a Blu-ray player, then...

534
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,920
You don't have an HD DVD player, right?

535
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Nope.

536
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,120
That's one of the things you don't have in your house, amazingly enough.

537
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
One of them.

538
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Amongst all the other crap you have.

539
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,080
You don't have an HD DVD player, though.

540
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,240
No, I actually know more people who have Blu-ray players myself.

541
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,040
Well, because they're built into the PlayStation 3s.

542
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,720
You don't own PlayStation 3s.

543
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Really?

544
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,640
This new Vio actually comes built in with Blu-ray for the players.

545
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,960
See, Sony just used...

546
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,920
I mean, if HD DVD loses, then it loses.

547
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,280
Fine, I went with the wrong format, but...

548
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
I'm surprised.

549
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,360
Sony is really pushing with all their...

550
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,480
Because, you know, Sony is not just a gaming company.

551
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,980
They are an electronics company and a major one at that, so they've been able to sneak

552
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,400
Blu-ray into all these other little places, and it's worked for them, where, for whatever

553
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,120
reason, beta didn't.

554
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,560
Well, there is still some hope, though, for people who...

555
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:19,280
Well, I guess it's not specifically HD-related, but they are dropping the price of the Xbox

556
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,720
360.

557
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,960
It actually said that it was scheduled to happen on August 8th, so the price reduction

558
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,880
should already be in place.

559
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:38,840
So we are seeing the Elite model go to $449, the Pro model to $349, and the Core at $279.

560
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:45,960
So of course, the premium had the biggest drop, given that that's the best seller.

561
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,600
And that price drop was totally a surprise to me.

562
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,400
And everybody out there on the internet.

563
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,640
Yes, the entire internet was shocked and awed at that price drop.

564
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm actually curious, though...

565
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,880
Well, I guess I don't think we have any stories on this tonight, so I can say that...

566
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,200
I think I want to say I read somewhere that Amazon, the sales of the Xbox 360 went through

567
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,360
the roof after the price drop.

568
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,200
So I'm just kind of curious if the same thing happened at the retail outlets or what happened.

569
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,720
Are you surprised they made the move at this time?

570
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,480
Because I'm actually kind of a little surprised they didn't wait until a little closer to

571
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Christmas.

572
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,800
Like, I would have expected the price drop a little more October-ish.

573
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,760
But maybe then again with Halo 3 coming out when it is, maybe they wanted to do it in

574
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,880
advance of Halo 3, which would certainly make sense.

575
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,880
So who knows?

576
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,520
I was just going to mention, there was another story I remember reading, I guess, that the

577
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:41,680
NPD group did a survey with people asking them whether they're aware of different features

578
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
of their console.

579
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,060
And I guess almost 60% of people didn't realize that the Playstation 3 had a Blu-ray player

580
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:52,080
in it, or had never used it for Blu-ray movies, which I thought that was a little bit funny.

581
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,840
Anywho, what I want to know is what are they using it for then?

582
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Motorstorm?

583
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,720
Is that the basketball game that's on it?

584
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
Is that it?

585
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,640
It must be all that wonderful download content that's online.

586
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Oh wait, no.

587
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
That's right.

588
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,800
Anyways, other countries are also getting a 360 price drop.

589
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
In fact, Canadians are seeing a pretty big price drop.

590
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:18,560
They will see a $100, of course that's in Canadian money, drop on the premium and core

591
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
systems.

592
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,160
So that's pretty awesome.

593
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:28,720
And yeah, so after that price drop, the premium will be running, I guess, approximately $378

594
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
US.

595
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,200
Still, of course, with the exchange rates, they pay more.

596
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,420
But for them, hey, $100 is cheaper.

597
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,420
That's pretty awesome.

598
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,360
I was going to say, usually with the exchange rates, the Canadians are paying a little bit

599
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,720
more for their gaming than we are, but it's certainly not the jump that you see from going

600
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,820
overseas to here.

601
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,680
So yeah, kind of interesting.

602
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,000
Well one thing that you can use your brand new Xbox 360 for if you decided to buy one

603
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,040
with the price cut is the firmware update that went out this week.

604
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,600
Unfortunately the firmware update wasn't really that exciting, it was just a small little

605
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
update.

606
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,600
And according to Major Nelson's blog, really the only thing that it was doing is preparing

607
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,960
the Xbox 360 to use wireless guitar controllers for you Guitar Hero 3 players, and if any

608
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,080
eventually come out for Rock Band and all that good stuff.

609
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,300
So there really isn't a whole lot else to that firmware update.

610
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,040
You know, it's kind of a bummer too because when you turn on your Xbox 360 and you see

611
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,600
ooh, a new firmware update is available, you kind of start to get a little bit excited

612
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,320
like ooh, I wonder what new features they've added this week, or what they're adding, or

613
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,120
is this the big seasonal update because they do a big one in fall and I think spring, of

614
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,000
course it's summer, so that wouldn't make sense for my brain to go there.

615
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,440
But you can still help but get a little bit excited when the thing comes up and says there's

616
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,320
a firmware update, like ooh, what cool new feature are they going to add, and then turns

617
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
out to be nothing.

618
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
Oh well.

619
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,320
That's poo.

620
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Oh well, I mean.

621
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
That's big stinky poop.

622
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,640
It was unexpected so it's, you know, can't really beg for a lot with that.

623
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,520
For anybody who is actually excited about anything having to do with Halo, well Halo

624
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:08,480
3 I should say, or likes having green Xbox 360s, the Halo themed Xbox 360 will be out

625
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:18,440
in September, priced for $399 with a wireless headset for $59.99.

626
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,640
I don't really see anything all that special about it, it says it's spartan green and gold,

627
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:30,100
really it looks to me like it's baby poop green with orange, at least that's what it

628
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,780
looks like, so.

629
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,840
As far as your HDMI cables, that comes separately.

630
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,560
That's exactly how they should market it too.

631
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
It's the new baby poop green.

632
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
You have an HDMI port.

633
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,200
Well they all have the HDMI port now.

634
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,720
But no cable.

635
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,040
Really the only thing that you get for the extra $50 is you get a plain charge kit that's

636
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:56,440
also the, I guess, baby poop green, and you get, you know, the wonderful baby poop green

637
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
paint job.

638
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,520
It does look like baby poop, it's that type of green.

639
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:05,600
If you do want HDMI cables, those will cost you about $50 and they're going to be sold

640
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,820
separately actually now that all the 360s with the premiums with the HDMI are coming

641
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,600
out.

642
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:18,220
So yay, you get the, and there's no even, there's no Halo 3 with it even, which is kind

643
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,140
of come on, I mean, why didn't they do that?

644
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,760
Because you know there's people that are going to go out and buy their Xbox 360 the day that

645
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,160
Halo 3 comes out.

646
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,840
They're going to finally make that upgrade because they've been playing Halo 2 this whole

647
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
time.

648
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:37,000
Oh my god, there are also two custom Halo 3 controllers there, one for the Covenant,

649
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,960
one for Spartans that are done by Todd McFarlane with collectible figurines, those are also

650
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,280
coming out, as well as skins, I'm sure, by Mad Catz and other companies, as well as useless

651
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,040
shit like an ammo case that holds controllers and crap from other companies.

652
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,280
People, I mean, really if you want Halo 3 and you're that big of a Halo nut, then you're

653
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,840
going to be a sucker and buy all this shit, and if not, you're not really that big of

654
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,560
a fan.

655
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:07,120
Son of Dad in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com calls the new color, Split P in Halo chunky

656
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,800
style Xbox 360, delicious, mmm, yummy.

657
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:20,960
Well anyways, speaking of Halo 3, apparently there are a lot of fans out there, who knew,

658
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,200
and Halo 3 has become the fastest selling pre-ordered game in history.

659
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,860
Apparently one million pre-orders have been taken in North America, a new record apparently

660
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,400
for those keeping track.

661
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:41,040
And also, you know, this all kind of ties in with their marketing campaign, including

662
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,120
7-Eleven, Burger King, Comcast, Mountain Dew, and Pontiac.

663
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:51,040
Honestly, Pontiac, how the fuck does that relate to Halo?

664
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,200
I can understand the 7-Eleven, because you know, you have that Halo Mountain Dew crap

665
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,000
and stuff that you can sell that, alright, and then maybe Burger King, because it's on

666
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,580
their cups and shit, maybe there's some kid's toys or something, but Pontiac, come on, there's

667
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,580
nothing to, seriously.

668
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,440
Were you going to hop on the bandwagon?

669
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,920
Are you really that hard up in selling your cars?

670
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,920
Maybe they're going to make tags.

671
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,720
I think that's pretty funny.

672
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,800
Maybe Pontiac's getting into the war car building business.

673
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,760
But really, would you want a war car made by Pontiac?

674
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,400
I mean, that's just like, that's just like, you know, this is my Volkswagen killing machine.

675
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,040
I mean, it's just, it's crap.

676
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,600
No, no, no, because remember Volkswagen wouldn't lend their likenesses for that kind of thing.

677
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,000
You know, I'd buy the Volkswagen one before I'd buy a Ford one, that's for sure, found

678
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,440
on road debt.

679
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,400
And I fix off and repair daily.

680
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,240
I hope they release like a Covenant car and a Spartan car, then they can have the fucking

681
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Halo fans.

682
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,880
I'm going to fucking kill you in my Spartan car, yeah that's right, it's better than your

683
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Covenant car.

684
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,480
Actually, I'm driving a Pontiac, you're both losers.

685
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,960
I'd buy a Pontiac if they put guns in the front of it, so I can shoot people who get

686
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
in my way.

687
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
I mean, come on.

688
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Alright, maybe not.

689
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,760
But I wanted to say about this, how is Halo 3 tied into the Comcast thing, because they're

690
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,960
going to have a little... we didn't get a baby shit green cable box.

691
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,240
Here's why, they're going to have videos on their Comcast on demand service, the service

692
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,440
that I never use, ever, they're going to have that on there.

693
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Hooray!

694
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,040
Are they even going to bother and do it in HD?

695
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,720
I guess this justifies them raising the rates on their cable, you know, oh thank you, I

696
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:38,760
get Halo exclusive content, and you're raising my rates and they're $5, thank you Comcast!

697
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:45,560
Oh, I could have just imagined my roommate's reaction if, you know, because it was bad

698
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,560
enough when they only offered him the $20 discount for wasting his whole day, and then

699
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,200
like fucking up his total order, I could just imagine if the thing had been, you know, oh

700
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:59,400
well, we're really sorry about the inconvenience, here's some free Halo 3 trailers!

701
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Yay!

702
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,400
Ah!

703
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,960
Joy plus Rapture equals no.

704
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
Wow.

705
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Interesting.

706
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,280
Yeah, I'm not surprised about the whole pre-order record-breaking thing, because like what you

707
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,480
said, the whole 7-Eleven tie-ins, like we talked about last week, how you can pre-order

708
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,520
Halo 3 at 7-Eleven now, it's crazy.

709
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,960
And then just the fact that, you know, many, many stores whore their pre-orderings now,

710
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,960
they've all taken a page from GameStop, and of course GameStop's still king of their game

711
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,320
every time somebody comes in, did you want to reserve Halo 3?

712
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,480
Did you want to reserve Halo 3?

713
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,920
Oh, I see you're buying Bratz for the DS, did you want to reserve Halo 3?

714
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,200
It's like, hey, you want to buy Madden from us?

715
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
We'll give you a free mini-poster.

716
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,880
No!

717
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
I don't like Madden.

718
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
How about Halo 3?

719
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
Now fuck off!

720
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,280
I'm sorry, I've been hearing about nothing but Madden lately.

721
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,440
You just bought Halo 3, do you want to pre-order Halo 3?

722
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:57,840
Every time I call Dan's store, it's like, blah blah blah blah blah reserve Madden, no!

723
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,400
I can imagine walking into GameStop, yes, I'm here to reserve Halo 3.

724
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Oh, great!

725
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,840
Would you like to reserve Halo 4 while you're at it?

726
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,920
I mean, if anyone, if they should have partnered up with a car dealership, or a car company,

727
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,880
it should have been like the fucking Hummer, because at least that's the size of the Warthog,

728
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,880
okay?

729
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Humvee.

730
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,720
Humvee, whatever.

731
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:28,140
The other thing I'm kind of curious about with all this is, oh, I know what I wanted

732
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,080
to say earlier that I couldn't think of.

733
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,240
I think one of the worst trends in retail across the board that I've seen now is fake

734
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,840
boxes to try to get you to pre-order the game.

735
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,200
You'll be walking down Best Buy and go, oh, I didn't know this game was out, and you reach

736
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,160
for it and you grab it, and then it's like, oh, a little sticker, pre-order, I know, and

737
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,800
it's a horrible, horrible trick that I always fall for.

738
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,560
Last summer, they had Madden 08 already in GameStop, I kid you not, they made up their

739
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,840
own box art so you can pre-order Madden 08, and this was literally weeks after Madden

740
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:04,000
07 came out, I mean, come on, seriously.

741
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,120
Tiger Claw says, Sky, I went to GameStop on Saturday and one of the employees, for some

742
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:12,280
bizarre reason, was wearing a cardboard box over his head.

743
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,400
Did it say pre-order Halo 3 on the top, maybe?

744
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,680
I don't know.

745
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,380
And the other thing, do we really need press releases that go out when your game's put

746
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,380
out?

747
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,560
It's the fastest selling game ever until the next game comes out and then it'll sell more.

748
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,960
I didn't even realize that there was a specific date when they started taking Halo 3 pre-orders,

749
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,680
I thought we'd been booking Halo 3 since, you know, everyone knew Halo 3 was in existence.

750
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,640
Alright, anyhow, let's move on off the Halo 3 talk, because there's plenty of other things

751
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,980
on the Xbox 360 people are looking forward to, including the next round of Xbox Live

752
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:51,160
Arcade games, and there's a lot of games slated to be coming out over the next couple months,

753
00:37:51,160 --> 00:38:00,000
including the much anticipated Hexic 2, also Echo the Dolphin, WarWorld, Geon Emotions,

754
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,880
Puzzle Quest, Space Giraffe, Streets of Rage 2, and of course Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo

755
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,920
HD Remix.

756
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,840
But I'm actually very much looking forward to that game.

757
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,160
Apparently they've done some balancing, they've changed a little bit the drops, like you know

758
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,720
how, for instance, Chun Li's drop pattern kind of sucked, like you know, because it

759
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,760
basically created power gems if you dropped a bunch on your opponent?

760
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,360
That's why you always use Donovan.

761
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,840
Well now, well they've changed some things so that like Chun Li now drops 120% more blocks,

762
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,440
even though it's in the pattern, and they've scaled some other people back to 80% of their

763
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,280
blocks, so to try and even out the way people play, so.

764
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,300
Yay, more power gems!

765
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,760
Could be interesting, I know.

766
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,380
That's kind of what I thought when I read that, I'm like, so they want you to make more

767
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,380
power gems?

768
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,520
Okay, okay, Janami, you don't use Dan unless you think that you're like God's gift to Puzzle

769
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
Fighter.

770
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,040
Or if you want to have a really hilarious Dan vs. Dan match.

771
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,680
Because he does nothing but drop red blocks.

772
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,480
Exactly, that's awesome.

773
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,920
Oh, the chat room is daring to correct me, Hitstun says, there's an X dash mode with

774
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,240
the new drop patterns, but there's also the original X mode.

775
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,820
My bad.

776
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,920
I'm still looking forward to the release, no matter what.

777
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,920
It'll be fun.

778
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,120
You know, I bet I could take you on Puzzle Fighter, Rob.

779
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,920
Well, we shall see in a couple weeks when the game comes out, won't we?

780
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
Yes, we will.

781
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,760
Well, speaking of other things that are coming out, though, well, rumored to come out, EGM

782
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:37,200
reported Penny Arcade is going to be having a game that will be on Xbox Live Arcade.

783
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Possibly.

784
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Possibly.

785
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:47,360
Um, we have a label of Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 1 on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness

786
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,520
to be out in the fall.

787
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,000
This one surprised me at all, because there's already Penny Arcade content on Xbox Live

788
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,880
and has been for a long, long time, because you can get, like, themes and little, uh,

789
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,800
clip arts, or the little game rickshirts and stuff.

790
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
I hope it's amazing.

791
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,440
I don't, if it's anything less than amazing, I'll be like, well, crap!

792
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,080
I'll probably download it anyway.

793
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,360
But it wouldn't surprise me at all if there ended up being a Penny Arcade game on the

794
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,220
marketplace, because Microsoft's kind of liked that lately, is that they're really trying

795
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:20,360
to get into those, you know, fan communities and the thing that the internet's all abuzz

796
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
about.

797
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
Microsoft wants a part of that, so.

798
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,680
Well, there's nothing actually confirmed yet, so.

799
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,180
All they'd have to do is throw money at them.

800
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,440
Money is what moves the world.

801
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Exactly.

802
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Awesome.

803
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,640
Well, anyways, um, we've got some good releases this week, and of course, unless you've been

804
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,180
hiding under a rock, um, and even then, you might still know about this, Madden is coming

805
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:48,240
out for everything, including the Coleco, Atari, okay, maybe I made that last part up.

806
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
Cool!

807
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
I want to get Madden on the Atari.

808
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,240
I want it on the Turbo Duo!

809
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
That's amazing.

810
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,600
Have you seen the Simpsons game trailer?

811
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,760
It actually has that.

812
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:00,240
It says, coming out for all game systems, and it shows the Coleco, Atari, you know,

813
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,440
like, Intellivision, Jaguar, that's awesome.

814
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,160
Dude, they should put it out on those systems, that would be rad.

815
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,520
So, no, that, it is coming out on most everything, I think, except for the Game Boy Advance.

816
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,480
And then, also, if you're not into Madden, on PlayStation 2, Shin Megami Tensei Persona

817
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,840
3 is coming out on PlayStation 2, and by the way, I brought my copy for you so you can

818
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,840
try it out.

819
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Hooray!

820
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:32,160
And then, let's see, Metropolis Mania 2, that's also coming out.

821
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,680
Let's see, Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1, yay.

822
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:47,600
On PSP, Dungeons and Dragons Tactics, Ghost Recon, oh, no, that's next week, sorry, sorry.

823
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:56,120
Let's see, other than that, oh, DS, DS are some good stuff.

824
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,280
Let's see, Luminous Ark, that's supposed to be pretty good.

825
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,600
Rune Factory, a fantasy Harvest Moon.

826
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,200
How many Harvest Moon games will come out this year?

827
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
That's a good question.

828
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,000
Heroes of Mana, that's supposed to be actually pretty good on DS.

829
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:18,040
Operation Vietnam, and High School Musical, Makin' the Cut, and yeah, that's pretty much

830
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,040
it.

831
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
It's Madden or nothin'.

832
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:29,840
Alright, well, I'm heading over to the Japanese release dates, and I'm here to tell you there's

833
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:35,000
not a goddamn thing worth noting coming out in Japan this week, nothing, there's nothing,

834
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,920
absolutely nothing coming out over there.

835
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,920
However, if you happen to live in Korea, you're getting some of the same things we are.

836
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,200
You're also getting Persona 3 on the PlayStation 2, but otherwise, it's a very slow week, nothing

837
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,200
of note.

838
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,800
I mean, I guess there's a couple small titles, but nothing worth mentioning, honestly, so

839
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
slow week.

840
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,120
Well, yeah, it's about the same, I'm over in the UK right now.

841
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,480
Premiere Manager 08, and Two Worlds.

842
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Slow times.

843
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
That's it.

844
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,440
However, lucky people are getting Blue Dragon on the 24th.

845
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,840
I think we are, too.

846
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Yep.

847
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,920
So, hey, we get something at the same time, and they're getting Blazing Angels later,

848
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,920
too.

849
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,920
Very cool.

850
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,240
You know, and this is just the calm before the storm right here.

851
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,800
This August is always the slow period, so we're gonna start seeing things really pick

852
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,080
up very soon here, like, you know, Blue Dragon, Metroid Prime 3, then we get in next month,

853
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,320
and then, you know, the Halo, everything.

854
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
It's gonna be a mess.

855
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:33,920
There's a to-be announced on here for Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System.

856
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,080
We need to get a date on that.

857
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,920
I thought that already came out.

858
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,920
It came out in Japan, yeah.

859
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,280
That was last week's releases in Japan.

860
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,520
It's sating pending for the UK, but nothing specific.

861
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,520
Let me put out a press release.

862
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,680
The issue would come out over here.

863
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,480
Let me put out a press release saying that's the crappiest title for a game, or a Final

864
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,000
Fantasy game.

865
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,360
The Rob D. would like to say August ain't slow this year because you're getting a Bioshock,

866
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,360
a Madden, everything.

867
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,240
Yeah, I know, I know, but I'm saying, like, you know, that's all towards the end of the

868
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,240
month.

869
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,240
Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

870
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,240
I wanna play Blue Dragon and Bioshock.

871
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,560
Rob was talking about, well, not Blue Dragon, but I'm talking about the other stuff.

872
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
No.

873
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,560
Well, just because you guys are anti-Madden.

874
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,400
It's still a slow month, even though those games are coming out.

875
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,560
I mean, look at it, okay.

876
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:22,680
So Bioshock, that's coming out next week, in the week of the 21st, and, well, that's

877
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,680
it.

878
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,680
I see.

879
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,560
So basically you're saying the problem with this month is that you just have, like, these

880
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,520
few A-list titles kind of tent-pulling us through the month.

881
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,520
Pretty much.

882
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,520
There's not a lot of other stuff.

883
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,080
Bioshock's next week, and then the week after that, you've got the Blue Dragon, Metrory

884
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:41,600
Prime 3, Stuntman Ignition, Tiger Woods 08, and stuff like that, but that's pretty much

885
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,840
it for the rest of the month.

886
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:48,920
September is crazy, and then beyond that, it's just, ugh, I don't even wanna know.

887
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
I fear November.

888
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
November's scary.

889
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,320
I'm sorry, Blue Dragon's the only one out of that list that I'm having any problem looking

890
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,320
forward to.

891
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,320
December's getting scary, too.

892
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,640
I'm not as looking forward to Metroid Prime 3 as you might think.

893
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,120
I was very, very, very disappointed that Nintendo did not decide to go online multiplayer with

894
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,120
it.

895
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,120
We need a Metroid Metroid.

896
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,120
Like old-school Metroid?

897
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,120
Yes.

898
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,120
Well, we get them on Virtual Console, if nothing else.

899
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,120
No.

900
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,120
Next week, I think.

901
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,520
We need an actual new Metroid game.

902
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,480
We need Metroid Wii.

903
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,480
We'll see.

904
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,480
Metroid Metroid.

905
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,480
We love Metroid.

906
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,480
But that's what we want.

907
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,480
That's Metroid Prime 3.

908
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,480
No.

909
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,480
No.

910
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,480
You want a 2D.

911
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,480
You need to be specific.

912
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,480
You want a 2D Metroid on the Wii.

913
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,480
I want a 2D Metroid on the Wii.

914
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
Alright.

915
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,160
Or, or like a, um, like, you know how, um, the Sega Aegis Fantasy Zone is with the, uh,

916
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,160
the, the 3D, 2D look?

917
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,160
What?

918
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,160
You need something like that.

919
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,480
I don't know if you heard, but there's, uh, rumors going around saying that Castlevania

920
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,280
Aria of Sorrow's gonna be, uh, shown at Let's Big, um, on the PC.

921
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,160
And so, if it's on the PC, then it could ideally come to consoles.

922
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,160
Interesting.

923
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,960
And that was the Game Boy Advance one, so.

924
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,720
We'll see.

925
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,160
Let's go ahead and move on and get back into some news.

926
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:02,760
Anyhoo, um, so we were talking a little bit earlier about firmware updates for the 360.

927
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,440
Well, the Wii, you know, couldn't be left out, so they decided to update to version

928
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,680
3, which you get some spiffy shit with that.

929
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:17,320
Um, now, nothing major like the Check Me Out channel or anything like that, but, uh, you

930
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:24,000
get a wonderful digital clock, hurrah, and, uh, the Forecast channel now displays the

931
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,280
current condition, yet it doesn't display the temperature, and the current condition

932
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,580
is still, like, I'll boot up my Wii at, like, 4 o'clock in the evening and it, it shows

933
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,800
a picture of a moon.

934
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,080
I'm like, look outside, you stupid Wii.

935
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,760
They're just trying to let you know that the moon's still there, okay?

936
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,760
Oh, good.

937
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,760
I'm glad to hear it.

938
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,760
Moon not destroyed yet.

939
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,760
Thank God.

940
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,760
Okay.

941
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,760
Oh, hooray.

942
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,040
This channel can now display two scrolling headlines at a time in the Wii menu.

943
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:58,080
Um, then, uh, let's see, the message board now has, uh, today's accomplishments message

944
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:02,880
as a white message, which will allow you to stand out, or allow it to stand out from other

945
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,880
messages.

946
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,160
I still hate those today's accomplishments things anyways.

947
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,760
Uh, address book can now be shifted around using A and B. There's a calendar that no

948
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:18,600
longer shows today's accomplishments, and scrolling messages in the Wii message board

949
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,360
now use a different sound.

950
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,640
I guess in the Wii shop channel, they've got some other stuff.

951
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,800
You can search by category, publisher, genre, but you still can't look at videos within

952
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,260
the Wii shop channel.

953
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,520
You have to go onto the internet to see that.

954
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,960
Um, and then, uh, of course, you know, there's some settings, I guess, warning added to pre-system

955
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,360
update detailing that, uh, technically modified consoles may cease to function.

956
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,660
So we break your mod chips!

957
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,660
That's right.

958
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,880
Um, the other thing that it did allow, um, is the freeloader to stop working.

959
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,520
So if you were, uh, thinking about using your freeloader to play other region, uh, GameCube

960
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,640
games, you just got served.

961
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,960
You got fucked over.

962
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,440
I'm surprised to see Nintendo caring so much because they didn't in the past.

963
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,680
Maybe they were afraid of future exploits like that, I don't know.

964
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,680
Who knows?

965
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:19,160
Uh, one other thing that should be said is the Wii system update also made the USB keyboards

966
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,440
now start working.

967
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,240
Uh, you can actually plug in a USB keyboard into the back of the Wii, uh, and you can

968
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,780
use your keyboard for the message board messages.

969
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,880
You can use it to type in some things.

970
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,600
Uh, you can use it when you're, um, like writing questions for everybody votes or whatever.

971
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,680
Uh, you can also do the internet channel.

972
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,680
Hooray.

973
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:45,400
However, you can't use it in the shop channel to search and I don't know what that's about.

974
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,800
Uh, can you use it in the internet channel?

975
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,800
I thought you couldn't.

976
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,600
Uh, apparently you can.

977
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
I'm pretty sure you can.

978
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,840
So, I don't know, I'll have to try it.

979
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,760
I bought a USB keyboard for Final Fantasy XI for the 360 and then I stopped playing.

980
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,600
So I have one sitting out there that I don't really use.

981
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,600
And it glows blue.

982
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,600
It's really pretty.

983
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,600
So.

984
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,600
I still had one from when I played, uh, Blue Burst.

985
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,600
Ah.

986
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,000
Well, or if I should just say Fantasy Star Online.

987
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Right.

988
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Hm.

989
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,680
At any rate, there's other stuff.

990
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,680
Well for anyone...

991
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,680
I'm sorry.

992
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,680
I'm sorry.

993
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,680
I'm sorry.

994
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,680
You know what?

995
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,680
You're right.

996
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,680
I screwed up.

997
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,680
It's, it's actually, you can't use it to do any of that other stuff.

998
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,940
You can only use the keyboard for the message board messages.

999
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,940
I screwed up.

1000
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,200
That was a can't on the internet channel.

1001
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,200
My bad.

1002
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,280
Well that's what I get for not testing it myself.

1003
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,400
I was, I'm just not kinda interested in that.

1004
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,240
I'm like, why would I use the Wii to surf the internet when I have a computer five steps

1005
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,240
away that can do it?

1006
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,240
I just don't get it.

1007
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,240
Sorry kids.

1008
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,200
Some people I guess want everything to do everything.

1009
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,840
I like having one thing that does one thing and then I think it does another thing.

1010
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:57,000
Well anyway, um, for anyone who has actually been keeping up with Super Mario Galaxy, there

1011
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,840
has been a few screenshots put in Famitsu, um, showing that there is a desert world and

1012
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:08,240
a haunted house so we can get our buddy Boo coming back.

1013
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,200
A desert world and a haunted house in a Mario game?

1014
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,520
That's completely new.

1015
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,800
Well, I don't think, was there actually a desert level in Mario Sunshine?

1016
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,880
In like every single Mario game since Mario Brothers 3.

1017
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,880
I don't know.

1018
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,720
I lost interest in Mario Sunshine about halfway through it.

1019
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:31,240
But Super Mario Galaxy will be coming out later this year and I want, and I want it

1020
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,840
to actually keep my attention.

1021
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,440
Awesome.

1022
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,720
Now, some other interesting stuff coming out.

1023
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:47,000
There was a patent found online for a motion sensing portable or at least something for

1024
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:55,000
a portable system to sense directional movements on the all different axis, basically a six

1025
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,300
axis built into a Game Boy Advance type thing.

1026
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:11,160
So um, maybe something in the future to be added to the DS, new handheld console, who

1027
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,160
knows.

1028
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:17,000
If I were to guess, I would say that maybe something to plug into the Game Boy Advance,

1029
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,400
or actually the DS, the Game Boy Advance slot, to use that actually as a controller for different

1030
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,960
games.

1031
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,920
Because you know, the DS, it can connect to the Wii, so might as well add some tilt sensing

1032
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,000
to it as well.

1033
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,720
God, I hope they're not putting out another portable system.

1034
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,720
Oh, they will.

1035
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,600
And they'll call it the Game Boy something else and they'll be like, hi, you get to buy

1036
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,400
it again, bitch.

1037
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,000
Part of me kind of hopes that they're doing this so that nobody else will.

1038
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,460
Like maybe they're doing one of those, like, what is it, the company that keeps filing

1039
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,000
the patents on the immersion?

1040
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,640
Yeah, like they're doing one of those types of patents where they're just doing it before

1041
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,720
anyone else can think of it because of the success of the Wii, I don't know.

1042
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,560
I just hope not.

1043
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,560
We'll see.

1044
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:13,280
Meanwhile, for the Nintendo consoles, as we mentioned earlier, Metroid and Super Metroid

1045
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,240
have been confirmed that they are on their way to the Virtual Console a little later

1046
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,200
this month, leading up to, of course, the release of Metroid Prime 3.

1047
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,680
All this can be found in the new Metroid Prime 3 preview channel, which you can download

1048
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,960
for the Wii, which I tried to do, but it would work.

1049
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,880
I got like three download arrows in a row, so I was like, forget it.

1050
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,560
Did you check out the Metroid Prime 3 preview channel, Loki?

1051
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,960
No.

1052
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,240
I could care less.

1053
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,240
I heard that basically it just has some pictures and things, and it has streaming video incorporated

1054
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,240
into the channel.

1055
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,240
Awesome!

1056
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,560
Why don't they do that with anything else, say the Virtual Console games, you bastards?

1057
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,000
You prove that you can do it, come on, do it.

1058
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,560
I don't know, I would also just kind of like to see demos, but I know the online storage

1059
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,680
on the Wii isn't very big, so probably asking for a lot.

1060
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,560
Stop crippling your damn system, people, seriously.

1061
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,120
Interesting.

1062
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,280
Drunami says, it's cool, but it's YouTube, basically.

1063
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,760
Well, you can't get an accurate portrayal of what the game looks like with something

1064
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,080
like YouTube graphics.

1065
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:23,000
I can't wait for someone to modify that channel, because I'm sure that whatever it's streaming

1066
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,520
is probably off the internet and not on your console, so that would be pretty cool to change

1067
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,200
the DNS in it or something, to stream video off of other things, so you could actually

1068
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:39,160
turn it into not really YouTube, but I don't know, maybe get Justin TV on there or something.

1069
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,520
Son of Dad says, I want streaming videos of Super Metroid.

1070
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,680
Well, maybe somebody will make a streaming video of this next segment, it's something

1071
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,760
we do every week here on the program.

1072
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,600
It's Dark Sakura's website of the week.

1073
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,260
She surfs the internet up and down and all around to find a website that she wants to

1074
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,080
share with all of you at home.

1075
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:07,760
So Dark Sakura, tell the kids where they should be pointing their web browsers this week.

1076
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:17,360
Today's website of the week is really a result of wishful thinking on my part, but it's ferretsunlimited.org.

1077
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,800
It's basically a shelter for ferrets.

1078
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:27,560
They have adoption services and they're actually in Ohio, but the good thing about this site

1079
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:36,240
is it also has information about needs, it has links to other shelters, how to shop,

1080
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:44,320
how to take care of your ferret, and eventually, so I'm working on trying to eventually have

1081
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,480
a ferret baby myself.

1082
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,560
Even though they're still illegal to own in California, aren't they?

1083
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,960
Not if somebody brings them out of state.

1084
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,000
You're going to smuggle in a ferret in California?

1085
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,120
You're going to smuggle in a ferret, hell yeah.

1086
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,920
You probably wouldn't be the first one to do it, I'm sure.

1087
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,920
Well, no.

1088
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,520
And on top of that, there's a few other sites out there on the internet that tell you where

1089
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:10,200
in California has a list of vets who will take care of your ferrets and not turn you

1090
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,200
in.

1091
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,920
So I think that's pretty cool.

1092
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:20,440
Or even better, they still sell the crap for ferrets at the store, but even though they're

1093
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,440
not allowed over here.

1094
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,440
Ferrets are the best pets ever.

1095
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,560
As much as I love my cat, I really want a ferret.

1096
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,120
What's going to happen when you have a cat and a ferret?

1097
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,000
Are they going to chase you around the house?

1098
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,960
Actually, I'd love for Shermy to get chased around the house, that big fat animal.

1099
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:43,200
Okay, my cat is intensely obese, and she's lazy, and I can't even chase her around the

1100
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,200
house.

1101
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,120
She's like, oh, it's just mom, she'll just step on me and then I'll be okay.

1102
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:54,720
Rob Roberts, reminding you to help control the ferret population, have your ferret spayed

1103
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,720
or neutered.

1104
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,720
Yes.

1105
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,320
And RossdielUT asks a good question.

1106
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,960
I actually don't know the answer to it, but I'm assuming you do, DarkSakura.

1107
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,560
Why the fuck are ferrets illegal in California?

1108
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,480
That's, okay, I don't know the entire thing.

1109
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,920
I actually haven't seen anything legitimate about it.

1110
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,000
But they're talking about some problem with certain breeds of them being endangered and

1111
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:24,120
with having this wild ferret population from strays, and I was like, that's stupid.

1112
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,180
I'll tell you why.

1113
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,000
It's because of Beastmaster.

1114
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,160
Because they don't want another one of those crappy movies made in California, so no ferrets,

1115
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,160
no Beastmaster sequel.

1116
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,160
You know what?

1117
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,940
My friend, before I moved out here, my friend- At least not another sequel.

1118
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:47,040
My friend was going to give me his ferrets, and their names were Koto and Poto.

1119
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,520
Okay, I'm on Wikipedia, of course, to find the answer to this question.

1120
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,260
Oh, I'm on ferretnews.org.

1121
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:57,280
And in the ferret article, it cites this reference, the Fish and Game Code of California, and

1122
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,720
what it says, quote, animals of the families viviridae, I'm sorry, I'm totally mispronouncing

1123
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,440
these, and mustelidae, which I'm assuming the ferrets belong to, in the order carnivora

1124
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:14,280
are restricted, because such animals are undesirable and a menace to native wildlife, the agricultural

1125
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,600
interests of the state, or to the public health or safety.

1126
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,160
In other words, they don't want ferrets gone wild on mountain streets.

1127
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,920
That's exactly, see, that's so stupid, and right now, they're actually still petitioning.

1128
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:37,800
And the last news as of March 29th was that, it was on here saying that, they're doing

1129
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,080
this thing where the government's trying to say that people do not want to have ferrets,

1130
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,360
when actually the most population of people are like, we don't mind ferrets.

1131
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:49,600
Yeah, but then you're going to get those two people that let the ferrets run loose outdoors

1132
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:54,480
like a fucking cat, and it's going to kill things, and screw up the ecosystem, and then

1133
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:01,480
you're like, I didn't know that ferrets shouldn't be outside, I'm totally oblivious to that.

1134
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:05,760
And then, you know, they ruin it for everybody.

1135
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,200
I don't know why we're talking about ferrets on a video game show.

1136
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,200
Hey, that's Orange Lounge.

1137
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,440
Yeah, we have ferrets, okay?

1138
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,440
A ferret.

1139
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,440
The ferret's in the box somewhere right now.

1140
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,440
Ferrets are great.

1141
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,960
We don't have a ferret in the studio yet.

1142
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:23,600
But no, I really, I really, really, really, really want a ferret, so I'm working on trying

1143
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,920
to get my significant other to agree.

1144
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,780
All right, I really, really want to get back into gaming news.

1145
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:35,880
Just to answer, son of dad ferrets live anywhere between 10 to 15 years.

1146
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:43,880
All right, anyways, so interesting stuff, actually I guess a decent game for the iPod.

1147
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,880
Hold on, wait a minute.

1148
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,120
Tiger Claw in chat has a great point.

1149
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,680
There's no ferret video games, like ever.

1150
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,680
Let's fix that.

1151
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,800
Has there ever been a ferret video game ever in existence?

1152
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,680
Has a ferret even been a character in a video game?

1153
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,680
Beastmaster.

1154
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,880
I cannot, besides Beastmaster.

1155
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,320
I can't think of anything where a, this is a travesty.

1156
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,120
2DX16 ferret.

1157
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,680
No, we need to have a game, okay, now that's.

1158
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,200
It said 2DX Troopers, that's bullshit.

1159
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,280
Let's put that up on the Orange Lounge Radio Xbox Live Arcade wish list, okay?

1160
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,720
We have Laser Cats, the game, and now we have Ferret, the video game.

1161
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,440
What, Loki?

1162
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,840
Actually there has been a ferret video game for the Game Boy Color created by Culture

1163
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,840
Brain.

1164
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:34,440
It's called Ferret Monogatari Watashi no Okini Eri.

1165
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,520
A big what?

1166
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,840
Anyways, Ferret Story, my dear ferret.

1167
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:45,720
It's a Japanese only video game that's a simulation style game where you take care of a ferret.

1168
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,400
It says at the start of the game you choose one of three different colored ferrets, colors

1169
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,060
are randomly chosen, the ferret is kept in the cage a bunch of the time but you have

1170
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:56,160
to keep his water and food topped off and clean its litter box.

1171
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,400
You can take the ferret out for walks or to play with it.

1172
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,320
You can also even play mini games, one is a race, one is putting together a picture

1173
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,320
and the other is dancing.

1174
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,320
It's Nintend Ferret.

1175
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,440
Yeah, and just like Nintendogs, the game gets fucking boring after playing it for an hour.

1176
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,880
I'm getting the ferret game, you watch.

1177
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,680
Hold on, we got a lot of comments in chat here on the ferret game.

1178
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,800
SSJ100Matt says, there's a ferret-like creature in Pokemon.

1179
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,760
Eh, not really a ferret.

1180
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,800
TheRobD says, was there a ferret in Bible Adventures or in Super 3D Noah's Ark?

1181
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:30,040
Probably not because ferrets are unclean, they're not God's animals.

1182
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,800
They weren't allowed on the Ark.

1183
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,200
Like lice, I don't think Noah took lice on the Ark.

1184
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,200
That's ok, the lice were in their hair.

1185
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,920
They didn't have rid back in the day.

1186
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,920
Exactly.

1187
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:45,120
RosteelUT says, putting a ferret in a video game will ensure that Schwarzenegger will

1188
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:48,080
never let ferrets in.

1189
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,920
You know what, he's a bastard anyway.

1190
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,560
I didn't vote for him.

1191
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,320
I voted for Gary Coleman.

1192
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,280
I voted for Mary Carey.

1193
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,920
Bandit says, there was a ferret in a video game called Penguin Wars for the Game Boy.

1194
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,000
Why would a ferret be in a penguin game?

1195
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I don't know.

1196
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,560
This is too bad.

1197
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,760
Alright, sorry Loki.

1198
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,040
Please put the show back on track if you can.

1199
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:16,240
There's this news website that has a character that they talk about, well a video game news

1200
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,440
site that's called Toothpick the Ferret.

1201
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,160
He has a giant cloud sword.

1202
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:27,200
Anyways, so yeah, a game for fifth generation iPods called Musica.

1203
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:35,160
It's created by the man behind Parappa the Rapper and it's a game that's basically

1204
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:40,580
a music visualizer game.

1205
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:46,040
More background I guess than anything and I guess when the game creates visuals based

1206
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:51,360
on the titles of your songs then it asks players to tap the center button in time with each

1207
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,440
letter of the name.

1208
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,960
And you get points for doing that and build up your combo, yada yada yada.

1209
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:03,120
So if you're interested in buying it, it's $4.99 on the iTunes store.

1210
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,120
I might have to check that out.

1211
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,240
I've been kind of wanting to check that out.

1212
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,360
But only if you have a fifth generation iPod.

1213
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,720
Well I might be able to dig one of those up.

1214
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,720
I think that this one I've got here is so I'll have to check that out.

1215
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,120
Of course you won't be playing this because you hate Apple and you don't have an iPod

1216
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,880
so that's right, not for you.

1217
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,160
Let's see, Tigerclaw, I hate to go back to the ferret thing but the chat room just won't

1218
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,920
shut up about it which is what I love about having a chat room.

1219
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:34,320
Bright stun says Hotaru Fukuba from Garumarka the wolves had a yellow ferret.

1220
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,440
I found the game online but it's a flash game.

1221
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,720
Let's see what else is there.

1222
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,200
Tigerclaw says if Nintendo or Sega is listening they have a potential franchise if they create

1223
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,480
Sonic the Hedgehog type game starring a ferret.

1224
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,640
Who knows.

1225
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,960
Well one game that probably won't be getting a ferret any time soon is Beatmania 2DX.

1226
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,900
Of course Loki was just talking about one other type of music game for the iPod.

1227
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,400
We got to go all the way back and honor one of the first music game series there was in

1228
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,400
existence.

1229
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:09,120
Beatmania now in 2DX in its 15th incuration is now being location tested.

1230
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,520
It's called DJ Troopers is the new theme.

1231
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,520
It's so stupid.

1232
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:17,000
It's kind of a silly name but of course a lot of people thought Red and Happy Sky were

1233
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,320
dumb names too.

1234
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,760
Happy Sky made sense at least it was very you know, Englishy.

1235
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:27,120
Well DJ Troopers I give it a chance because it's kind of green like camo colors are kind

1236
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:32,000
of green so that's one color they haven't really done yet so I give it a chance.

1237
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,200
What is the cutest thing ever?

1238
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:39,600
Beatmania 2DX has not really changed a whole lot over the past few games.

1239
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,040
I mean little subtle changes here and there but the game itself hasn't changed a whole

1240
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,040
lot.

1241
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,280
Well it has been location tested or is it going through location tests in Tokyo right

1242
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,720
now and some of the songs are sneaking out.

1243
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:55,760
There's a new song from Chorus K called Evergreen, a new song from Akira Yamaoka called Shift.

1244
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,960
It's a techno song, should be fun.

1245
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,560
Another remix of A is in the game which should be interesting.

1246
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,360
New songs of course are green colored in the song list.

1247
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:10,560
The five keys modifier now uses keys three through seven instead of one through five

1248
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:14,320
when playing on the two player side which is kind of a different type of change there

1249
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:22,520
for those that like to play five key mode and a song called Deep Strikers has 1,528

1250
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:29,240
notes on Hyper and is a 12 rated song on Double Hyper and that's going to be crazy.

1251
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,480
They got rid of a bunch of songs by the way.

1252
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:35,320
Bag is finally no longer in 2DX.

1253
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,720
But also Sad Diamond Jealousy is also gone finally.

1254
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,720
So there you go.

1255
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,640
I'm sure we'll be hearing more about this on your favorite music gaming website as the

1256
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,040
week goes on and more stuff comes out of location tests.

1257
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:50,160
I'm sure YouTubes are coming far behind.

1258
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:55,800
Well I have some happy that I hope would be something that happens.

1259
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:04,360
There is actually a hint about there being a downloadable sequel on PSN for Parappa.

1260
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,480
I would just be so happy to have more Parappa.

1261
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:11,120
But right now it's in rumor phase.

1262
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:14,640
The creator of Parappa the Rapper just sort of talked about it.

1263
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,640
Not really.

1264
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,560
He said, oh yeah, let's just do it.

1265
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,560
Fuck Parappa.

1266
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,560
I want Umjama Lammy.

1267
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,360
Dude, that would be cool.

1268
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:26,560
How come we always hear about Parappa this, Parappa that, Parappa remake, Parappa going

1269
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:30,440
to be on the PlayStation Network maybe but there ain't shit about Umjama Lammy.

1270
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,600
We need Umjama Death Metal.

1271
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,280
Or what was it, there was Umjama Lammy and then Rami was her friend, right?

1272
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,280
Rami.

1273
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,280
And Rami was her opposite.

1274
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,280
Who was the goth chick.

1275
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,280
Yes.

1276
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,040
And this is something that sucks because I wanted the hell level but instead they put

1277
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,800
him on an island.

1278
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,960
And Rasteel Utis theorizes maybe it's because Umjama Lammy sucked but that would be a lie

1279
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,520
because Umjama Lammy was awesome so I failed to see your logic, I'm sorry.

1280
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,280
So there you have it.

1281
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:02,080
I suppose though if the Parappa thing did come out for the PlayStation Network and it

1282
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:08,520
sold like crazy, maybe we could convince them to do an Umjama Lammy song in game.

1283
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,520
We'll see.

1284
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,120
All right, anyhow, that's going to bring this segment of Orange Launch Radio to a close

1285
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:17,080
but we will be back with Part B right after a quick break.

1286
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:21,760
Orange Launch Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1287
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,760
a week.

1288
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:46,200
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Launch Radio.
