We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Wokey!

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, August 26, 2007, new Castlevania games are being made for an unlikely platform,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Sony confirms a video recorder for the PlayStation 3,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and a much anticipated 360 game gets pushed back to December.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are that video game podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My head is numb.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who doesn't have a microphone on tonight?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I do now.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There you go. How are you doing?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hey, I have a head injury, so leave me alone.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry to hear. What happened to your head?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I was getting out of the car and then I was getting back into the car and my foot slipped out from under me.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
On the gravel outside and I hit my head on the top of my Lancer.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Aw, sorry to hear it.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Metal hurts when it hits you in the head.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It was like one moment I'm upright, the next moment I actually have my head laying on the seat of the driver's side of my car.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Do you think that the great people up in the sky were trying to tell you something?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I have a concussion, Rob.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Sorry to hear it.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, this should make for a riveting tonight's show, so we'll see.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All right, also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hi, Loki. How are you doing?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Doing good.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Excellent.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All right, well, let's get into how we like to start the show off always with a little bit of how is your gaming week.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If you want to join along and participate in the program, though, head on over to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and you can participate in tonight's program.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Meanwhile, let's start it off.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I played a bunch of Final Fantasy VI in the car and then didn't save it.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's not good.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
On a Game Boy Micro, I was extra motion sick for the entire time. It was fantastic.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And then I got like 2 million, I'm sorry, 2 billion on a World Cup soccer the other day. I was pretty happy.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Pinball?

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, pinball.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Pinball fun?

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, hi, they just take up space. I have no choice but to play them.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What's more fun, pinball or Final Fantasy?

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Pinball.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
All right, just curious.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I would sell Final Fantasy Pinball if that existed.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Dude, that would be beautiful.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They should make a Final Fantasy Pinball.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But pinball is instant gratification because it goes banging. It makes noises.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And I actually...

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's banging.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Dan took the glass off of our Twilight Zone, so I put the camera in and took pictures from inside the machine.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You know what else would be cool with pinball machines? A laser light show, if they could do that, too.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Tonight's show is very broken. I'll explain why in a minute. I'm trying to multitask in a lot of different ways.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Anything else you want to share with your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't like concussions. They should make concussion the game.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How exactly does that work? How would concussion the game?

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You just go around hitting people in the head.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And the worse of a head injury you give them without killing them, the better you score.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
All right, well, let's go over to Loki and check in with you. How was your gaming week?

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My gaming week was good. Not quite as extensive as last week, but still good.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's see, of course, being that Bioshock came out, of course they played tons of that.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And I haven't really gotten too far in it yet.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I actually restarted the game once because I realized...

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm trying to streamline my achievement getting there.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I realized there was an achievement for not killing any of the little sisters.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So, unfortunately, I rescued the first little sister and then killed the second one because I wanted to see what happened.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What happened was...

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You just want to see what happens when you kill little girls.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What happened was that I was unable to get an achievement, so I need to restart the game, so now I'm doing that again.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I love how you'll go back and play the whole game over just because you missed an achievement.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, hell yeah. Well, I don't want to have to play the whole game over again.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I wasn't that far to begin with, so now I'm just going back and doing what I did.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And then, of course, I played the Silent Hill Origins demo that magically got leaked out there.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So, I played that on the PSP, and I gotta say, man, between what we saw originally, like the Konami BBQ,

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
to what it is now, completely different game.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I mean, this game looks friggin' awesome.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's just... I don't know, it looks actually better than some of the PlayStation 2 versions.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, definitely one to pick up on the PSP.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And, let's see, other than that, I actually played a little bit of Saints Row.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We finally got our entire game room up at work, and we did a five-player Saints Row deathmatch on that.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It looks sweet, the setup we have, and hopefully I'll have some pictures soon.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What exactly does your game room at work consist of?

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The game room at work consists of five Xbox 360s, and there's LCD monitors for each one of those.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And then, four of those are tied into a 37-inch LCD TV that we have mounted to the wall.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So, if you really wanted to, you can actually tune in on the TV, four different monitors,

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and see what other people are, you know, their perspective.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So, if someone's watching us play, they don't have to look over our shoulders,

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
they can actually dial it in and see what other people are doing.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Or, you know, you can just play it on the TV if you're only doing one person on there or something.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So, other cool things we talked about doing with that is actually like Project Gotham Racing,

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
where you could do four people actually racing each other,

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and then the fifth one would be on the big screen,

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and that would be kind of one of the spectator mode options there,

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
so that way everyone's racing and you see like kind of a racetrack view of the whole game.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So, that would be pretty slick.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But, it's basically for the event that we've got coming this coming week,

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
with our publishers coming out and stuff.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And also, really it's for Grand Theft Auto IV, because we're that obsessed with Grand Theft Auto.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Too bad you got all that set up, and now you're going to have to wait until next year, though.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's okay. We've got Saints Row in the meantime,

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
and we're going to beg the publishers to give us copies,

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
multiple copies of upcoming games that would possibly be something we'd want to play.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
All right, well, let me get some comments here from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchrader.com.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm looking at rawstealut says,

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Not killing any of the Little Sisters is how you get the best ending, too.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And then undeadzerglings asks, Achievement Whore?

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, Loki's an Achievement Whore.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He will buy games just to get the achievement points out of them.

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Not necessarily. I don't really do that anymore.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I will play games that are crappy for your achievements sometimes.

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Out of the last few Xbox Live Arcade releases,

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
how many would you say you bought strictly to get the achievement points out of them?

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
None of the recent ones, because I've kind of got a little bit smarter on that.

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But let's see, previous ones that I bought for achievements, Pac-Man, Frogger.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Shit, what else did I buy?

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't know, there's quite a few games that I bought on kind of like an impulse buy.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Luckily now I've gotten it where I don't buy games straight out right.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I will play the demo first, except for Catan.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Catan had to download the full thing, but I knew what that was before I played it.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But yeah, now I strictly play the demos first, and then if I like it, I'll buy it.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
SHA100Matt in our chat says, so Loki is more of a high-priced whore now.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Exactly.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
My gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I, unlike most of America, did not run out and buy Bioshock right away.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because I'm kind of holding out to see if some used copies or a price cut shows up.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Plus I'm going to be in LA most of next week.

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I would say, well locally you can buy it at Fry's for $49.99.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Really? See, that's what I'm holding out for, some deals like that.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I heard Circuit City was doing some type of sale too.

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's the other thing too I was going to say.

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I bought the limited edition, and I'm sure everyone read on the internet that they've had some problems with the figurines breaking.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And I was so lucky that I went into GameStop, and there's a big fucking post-it note on mine that says broken figurine.

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And they're looking at it, and they're looking at me and kind of thinking in their heads, how are we going to get this guy to take it?

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So they're all, yeah, this is the last one, and the figurine's broken.

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know what to do to fix it, so I needed to go to some website.

138
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm like, well do you have the website that I'm supposed to go to?

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well I don't know what it is, let me check my email.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Finally they got it for me.

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But you know, to be honest, I opened the thing up, took some super glue to it, you can't even tell it broke.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So I don't care, I don't want the fucking art book.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You can download it for free, I don't need that thing.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But the other thing about the limited edition, if you are, I don't know if you can still buy them now,

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but if you are thinking about buying one, let me put it this way, the remix CD that they have on there with three tracks,

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
they're remixed by Moby, they suck really bad.

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They are some of the worst remixes I have ever heard.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I mean, it is just, I would be embarrassed if I was Moby and releasing that shit.

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It was awful.

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Moby did a whole album of awful though.

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I haven't watched the behind the scenes DVD or anything like that, so I can't really judge that.

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But that, I popped in that music CD last time, like ooh, remixes, I'm going to check it out.

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No, it was crap.

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Awful, awful, awful crap.

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But the game is awesome though, so it doesn't matter.

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I just wanted the figurine for my desk.

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Didn't give a shit about the extra CD.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Alright, well let's see, what did I do for My Gaming Week?

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
My Gaming Week, oh gosh, I didn't do a whole lot of new stuff.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I did play some of the new offerings on Xbox Live Arcade, like Space Giraffe.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Space Giraffe is interesting because it tries to assert itself that it's not Tempest,

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
although it kind of is Tempest to me.

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But here's the thing, and I love Tempest,

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Tempest 2000 is one of my favorite games of all times.

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Space Giraffe is really hard to see.

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The colors that they chose to use in this game, the purples and the yellows,

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
they all blend together and it's really hard to make out what the hell is going on in this game.

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Unlike the old school Tempest, where the web was blue,

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
the enemies were red, your bullets were green,

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
it was really easy to see everything kind of stick out,

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and not so easy in this one.

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I wasn't big on the visuals in Space Giraffe,

173
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
although I did think some of the jokes were really funny.

174
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There's pictures in the background,

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and when you get the pods that let you jump off the web,

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
it will say, Pod Get, and all these interesting things.

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's fantastic.

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's kind of funny.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's obvious that the developers obviously love themselves some games,

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
but I don't know.

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The visuals really take a lot away from the game for me.

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So that's really it.

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Other than that, I've just been trekking along as usual on World of Warcraft.

184
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm looking forward to playing Overlord,

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
because I just got a copy of that,

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
so I'm going to be checking out Overlord this week.

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So we'll see how that goes.

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's awesome.

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I would be still playing it if Bioshock didn't come out.

190
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's just stupid fun.

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I mean, it's one of those games that they try to convince you

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that doing the right thing is going to benefit you in some way,

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and then just unfortunately the AI just really pisses you off,

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and you're just like, fuck it, I'm going to kill you all now.

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And then you realize, hey, helping them out actually didn't do anything for me,

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
so I'm just going to kill them all.

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
All right.

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's pretty much it for my Game of the Week.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't have a lot else to share, so what else do we get into now?

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I guess we can move on to some housekeeping.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So housekeeping.

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
First off, we are going to be incorporating video into the show real soon,

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and that's why you've heard me kind of messing around a little bit

204
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
during the pre-show there, and I am somewhat distracted,

205
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
because on the laptop I'm playing with this site we're going to be using

206
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
to stream our video, operator11.com,

207
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
which if you guys are familiar with All Games All Games Interactive,

208
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
it's the website they use,

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
they've been encouraging some of the other shows on the network to start using it.

210
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Although I do want to make clear, we're not turning into a TV show,

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and we're not going to be using video too heavily.

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We just want you guys to be able to see us as we broadcast the show if you want.

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know why people would want to see that.

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And we're not going to be using the, was it the...

215
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You can call us with your webcam and all that stuff?

216
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, that...

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hey, playing porn on the webcam,

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
that was something that we did back at the old apartment,

219
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
a couple studios ago, when we used to play Gals Panic over the webcam.

220
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah, no, we're not going to be turning into a TV show suddenly,

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
it's just like a little something extra.

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And the funny thing is, I was streaming the first part of the show,

223
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
but this is how fickle it is and how broken it is,

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I was actually streaming the first few moments of the show,

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and then I accidentally clicked the wrong link, and now it's gone.

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Like, I accidentally refreshed the page and screwed everything up.

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So I'm going to have to start over again later or something, I don't know.

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So I'm still trying to get used to this program.

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So maybe we'll stream part B, I don't know.

230
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But it's off now, it was going.

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But in the channel, there's some video of me playing Super Metroid earlier,

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but the audio is all screwed up.

233
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I really don't encourage you to visit it.

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's not worth your time.

235
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We're trying, though.

236
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We've heard a lot of folks, especially the folks that listen to us live on Sunday night,

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
want to see video, so we're trying to add that into the show,

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
but we're not going to go TV all of a sudden.

239
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Why would you want to see video?

240
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't know.

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We don't do anything.

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We don't really do anything.

243
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't know what you think this is.

244
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Are they under the impression that there's an actual lounge in here,

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
that we're all kicking back with martinis or something, you know?

246
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Just shooting the shit.

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I mean, we're just sitting in a small room.

248
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I think it has potential maybe later on if we want to shoot video

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
at whatever tournaments we end up at or shows we end up at.

250
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We can put that in the show and interviews we do as well,

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and then the video users can see video,

252
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
but the audio users don't have anything taken away from them.

253
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You know what I mean?

254
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So I just want to see how we can enhance with video.

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But that's a long time coming.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We'll see.

257
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
If you have ideas, e-mail us, mailbag at orangelandrader.com,

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and I, of course, will be talking to some of the folks

259
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
that already use Op 11 and see what they think.

260
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But I don't want to go crazy with a TV show,

261
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and Dark Soccer doesn't like TV either,

262
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
so I know she's not a big fan of the television.

263
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Especially with Scott's public access green screen,

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
his little test thing.

265
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'd laugh.

266
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I was just like, oh, my God, dude.

267
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Good times.

268
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
All right.

269
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Well, anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

270
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some gaming news?

271
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's so incredibly cheesy.

272
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Anyways, no, gaming news.

273
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So this week, a little interesting.

274
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We're going to start things off, of course,

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
talking about a very interesting development out of Leipzig,

276
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and that would be the new track and field game on the DS.

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's, I guess, the 25th anniversary of track and field,

278
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and as you remember last week,

279
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I could care less about the Xbox Live Arcade game,

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
but now there's the new international track and field game,

281
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
which is going to feature 20 different athletic events,

282
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and I guess there was going to be some unlockable Konami characters to play,

283
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
including they've got Sparkster from Rocket Knight Adventures

284
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2,

285
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
which, to be honest, I think Pyramid Head would win

286
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
because he'd just butcher everybody else,

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
but I wonder if raping people is one of the events in there

288
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
because he only rapes monsters.

289
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Pyramid Head being in the game is all kinds of awesome, though,

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
you have to admit.

291
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's pretty rad.

292
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Anyway, later in the program, during part B,

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
we'll be talking about characters we would like to see

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
in this track and field game in a segment we call Listless,

295
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
but we'll get into that a little later in the program.

296
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
They didn't say anything else about the events

297
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
or any additional, like, how the game will play.

298
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Is it going to be button mashing again?

299
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's what I want to know.

300
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Well, I'm assuming since it's on the DS,

301
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
it's probably going to have something to do with the stylus,

302
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but they didn't really say anything other than

303
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
there will be four player matches via,

304
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
they said locally or via Wi-Fi.

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm assuming Wi-Fi ad hoc and Wi-Fi infrastructure.

306
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Downloadable content and online rankings, leaderboards,

307
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
and detailed player profiles.

308
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So that's kind of cool that they're going to do leaderboards

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and that kind of thing.

310
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And I guess a ticker to include, like, a news feed.

311
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It says promise to update anyone playing online

312
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
whenever a world record is broken.

313
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh great, so playing the new track and field is going to be like watching CNN.

314
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You're going to have to try and watch what's going on in this box,

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and you've got the ticker down here,

316
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and then you've got the stock report over here,

317
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
or, I'm sorry, the people that are online over here.

318
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
How did they cram all that on a DS screen?

319
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It looks cool.

320
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm surprised they didn't do, like, a Wii version to go along with that, you know.

321
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Alright, looking at chat here and what's going on there,

322
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
your nickname says,

323
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Memo to Konami, use the fucking DDR pad for track and field.

324
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Undead Zurgling says, I think Pyramid Head only rapes dolls.

325
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
No, he rapes the nurses too.

326
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Escapist says, just what the world needed, more track and field.

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Nintendo Maniac 64 said, Pyramid Head's in track and field? Dude!

328
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And then going back to the webcam chat we had just before the show started there,

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
let's see, we had Jaded says,

330
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I think it would be funny seeing Loki kick everyone's ass during one of his fits about Max.

331
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Kropotkin says, I mean, seeing people's faces stresses what people are thinking and saying.

332
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Dark Knight says, remember Rob did TV before.

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That was, like, ten years ago. I wouldn't even count that.

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm an old man now.

335
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
My young, fresh television face is long gone.

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Alright, let's...

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Now it's kind of moldy.

338
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yes, it is getting a little moldy and wrinkly.

339
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Alright, but you'll be able to see it in all its glory in Op11.com pretty soon.

340
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
As soon as I figure out how to get through an entire segment without screwing it up and deleting all the video.

341
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That'll be wonderful.

342
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I did want to say that for anyone who actually watches Deviant, who's on DeviantArt,

343
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
UdonKru did the cover art for the track and field game.

344
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So you can actually check out their DeviantArt page for some of the work they did on it.

345
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And some of those chibi characters were really cute.

346
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Like, chibi Pyramid Head is still a winner.

347
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I do have to agree with Shane, though.

348
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
They used the movie P-Hitty.

349
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
They didn't use the P-Hitty that you love and adore?

350
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No, not the one with the unwieldy, gigantic head.

351
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Sorry to hear it.

352
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, moving on to other DS releases that will be upcoming very soon.

353
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Final Fantasy IV has gotten some coverage in Famitsu Magazine.

354
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And you can get your hands on some of the latest scans there from Famitsu Magazine.

355
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
They're all around the web.

356
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And boy, this game looks pretty hot.

357
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I mean, imagine, again, Final Fantasy IV, but in Final Fantasy III's engine, so to speak.

358
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And I was just looking at some of these screenshots.

359
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It looks great.

360
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It looks like you still have five people on the battlefield, obviously,

361
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
because that was kind of important to the story.

362
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But I was looking at pictures of, like, here's a picture.

363
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I know this is great television here.

364
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But here's a picture of Rydia looking all younger and everything.

365
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And the Dragoons.

366
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Pretty awesome.

367
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I know dsfamboy.com has a picture of the scans if you want to check that out.

368
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm sure they're all around the internet as well, though.

369
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
However, no release date still revealed for this game,

370
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
but probably pretty soon in Japan and probably a little bit longer for us in the U.S.

371
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Have you heard anything about a release in the U.S. for this, Loki?

372
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
No, the next two games come out here.

373
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There's Final Fantasy Tactics The Lion War, Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings,

374
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Front Mission DS, and Dragon Quest Monsters Joker.

375
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And this will probably be, if anything, in the spring, maybe.

376
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We'll see.

377
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Well, that's all I have to say on Final Fantasy IV,

378
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
but it is one of my favorite Final Fantasy games,

379
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
so I'm very excited to see what they pull off of this.

380
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yeah, wake me up when they bring out VI.

381
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Rob, are you spoonie?

382
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's a possibility.

383
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You're a spoonie bard.

384
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll have you know.

385
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
No.

386
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Well, for anyone who's into mobile gaming,

387
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
there is an offering for the mobile phone.

388
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This Castlevania Order of Shadows that they're saying is a collaboration with Igarashi,

389
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
who I got a hug from.

390
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That was great.

391
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Well, sort of.

392
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I took a picture with him.

393
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But I thought that it was very interesting that it just says collaboration,

394
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
so I don't really know if he's actually going to be involved on it.

395
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There's also a developer's corner on the mobile website for Konami

396
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
where they have it listed there as the lead game designer is Tyrone Rodriguez.

397
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So, anyway.

398
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But it's supposed to be released on September 18th,

399
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
so if you really care, then have fun.

400
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I was looking at some of the pictures of it, and, well, I don't know.

401
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's a cell phone game.

402
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
How great can it be?

403
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'll tell you what, though.

404
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It has the skull thingies.

405
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
There's some pretty powerful stuff on cell phones right now.

406
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Will it be dualed?

407
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Well, not like that, but not necessarily game-wise, but application-wise.

408
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Like, you know how you can download Gmail

409
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
and actually run that as an application on your phone?

410
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Depending on what, like, your phone has to be kind of made in the past couple years,

411
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and it runs like Java-based things.

412
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But now they have an Opera mini browser,

413
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and I swear it is so much more powerful and better than the Sprint built-in browser

414
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
that I have on my phone otherwise.

415
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's awesome.

416
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, this doesn't look too bad.

417
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And Yahoo has its own thing now, too.

418
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So, I'm sure cell phone games are getting better and better,

419
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
but it's still not my gaming platform of choice, that's for sure.

420
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I know what the graphics remind me of.

421
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What's that?

422
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It reminds me of Rondo of Blood on the TurboGrafx.

423
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's what it looks like.

424
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Interesting.

425
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
All right, well, let's move on to some more stories.

426
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes, and speaking of other phone-based games,

427
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and more homebrew stuff, of course.

428
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
MAME has been ported over to the iPhone,

429
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
or at least it's beginning to be ported over there.

430
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Right now it doesn't really run a lot,

431
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
but some games like Pac-Man and Qbert run pretty well.

432
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And then, of course, some other ones you have to have with frame skipping

433
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
and lower sound quality.

434
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But, I don't know, it looks interesting.

435
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You had a start of better things to come, I'm sure.

436
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But the iPhone's going to be an interesting platform to program games on

437
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
because I would think that looks like a little bit beefier of a phone,

438
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
at least a pretty large screen on them,

439
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
compared to, say, a normal phone.

440
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And then, of course, with the touchscreen stuff.

441
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It'll be interesting.

442
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It still doesn't sell me on an iPhone just yet.

443
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Oh, fuck no, it's $600.

444
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Well, you remember Extrofer from the show, right?

445
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
He just bought an iPhone, and he's all crazy about it.

446
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
There are some really cool things that the iPhone does, don't get me wrong.

447
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And there is that impulse buyer in me that kind of wants one.

448
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And I think I put to somebody else,

449
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
an iPhone is probably on my list of wants above a PlayStation 3 still.

450
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But the thing about Apple is that you know next year

451
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
they're going to come out with a different model that is a little bit better.

452
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Next year? Let's try, like, Christmas.

453
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
We'll see. I don't know.

454
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
RossdielUT says,

455
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The iPhone sucks for gaming, it has no real buttons.

456
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Jaded says, MySpace will redeem the iPhone, lol.

457
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I think that means sarcasm there.

458
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Again, if you want to join our chat, chat.orangessontrader.com.

459
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Of course, lots of development going on for cell phone games,

460
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and also another system that kind of makes people raise their eyebrows

461
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
when new games are announced for it, the Dreamcast.

462
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yes, the Dreamcast still has games being built for it.

463
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
There's some games being made by Red Spot Games,

464
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and at the Leipzig Games Convention they were showing Dalforce.

465
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's a shooter title, which is up to four players,

466
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
because remember the Dreamcast, you had four ports on there.

467
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And there's another game called Wind and Water Puzzle Battles.

468
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's a puzzle action game that's being ported from another system.

469
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Both games are scheduled to be released in the first quarter of 2008.

470
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So all you hardcore Dreamcast fans can check out those games.

471
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm still missing, I have a box with my Dreamcast packed in it.

472
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Or two boxes. I've only found one, and that one has, like,

473
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
just the AV cords and controllers.

474
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm like, where's my Dreamcast?

475
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You know, I think I might have it, because I only got two Dreamcasts.

476
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh, maybe that's where it is, okay.

477
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Maybe when your Dreamcast got put in a box of mine somehow,

478
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
when we lived together like three years ago.

479
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I need it back just so I can play Dreamcast games.

480
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Sure thing, I don't really use it anymore.

481
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Would you buy new games for Dreamcast, Dark Saga?

482
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Yes.

483
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Just because?

484
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Yes.

485
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I mean, okay, don't get me wrong.

486
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I don't buy Dreamcast.

487
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I don't know if I'd buy new games for Dreamcast,

488
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
but if I remember correctly, I think the copy protection

489
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
of Dreamcast games was pretty crappy, so.

490
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
All right, well, I don't think I'll be buying these,

491
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
but it'll be interesting to see what happens with it.

492
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That's for sure.

493
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Well, back to more present-day gaming information,

494
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I think this is really cool.

495
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
They're basically saying that in the U.S.

496
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,000
that the sales of games and consoles has raised,

497
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
gone up by 37% since the time of 2006.

498
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Total sales coming up to $925 million,

499
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
which I think is actually pretty cool.

500
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
But it's not a billion.

501
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So you know what?

502
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Wake me up when it's a billion.

503
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The total sales are at $7 billion.

504
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
All right.

505
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah.

506
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But basically, hardware itself is actually raised by 77.4%.

507
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
$380.8 million sold.

508
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And actually, most of it is the Wii.

509
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Wait, and this was over the same period last year is what it is?

510
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yeah.

511
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Okay, that makes sense,

512
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
because you have new systems out there,

513
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
the Wii and the PlayStation 3, for whatever it's worth,

514
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
that just weren't out there at this time last year.

515
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And the PS2 and PSP were outselling the Xbox 360, of course.

516
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Biggest games of the month were NCAA Football 08 on 360,

517
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Guitar Hero Encore, Roxy 80s, PS2 Wii Play,

518
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
NCAA Football 08 on PS2, and Mario Party 8 on Wii.

519
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That's amazing that Wii Play still continues to sell so many copies.

520
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
But I guess it's just people wanting a free Wiimote.

521
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Sort of.

522
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Also, I should point out that sales in Japan have also increased quite a bit.

523
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The DS itself went actually just within a week,

524
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
sold 153,834 units.

525
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
That was pretty cool.

526
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
This is the last week, fiscal week, I should say.

527
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
For the Wii, it actually made it up to 73,938,

528
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
thanks to some of the really cool games that are out.

529
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
PSP, no real game success.

530
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
They've sold 33,715 units.

531
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
PS3, 21,231 units.

532
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Numbers, numbers, numbers.

533
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
What does it all mean, though?

534
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'd say one of the biggest sellers were Everybody's Golf 5.

535
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Huh.

536
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Which is a game that's not even out here yet, right?

537
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
No.

538
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Interesting.

539
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Other games that were giving the PS2 a boost were J-League winning 11, 2007.

540
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But the poor Xbox 360, poor baby, only 2,445.

541
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Poor, poor baby.

542
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Wait, 2,000?

543
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah.

544
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Xbox 360s or regular Xboxes?

545
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
They don't like Xbox 360.

546
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
No, that can't be right.

547
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
There's got to be more than that.

548
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Blue Dragon sold more copies than that.

549
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
My apologies.

550
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Maybe it's regular Xboxes.

551
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It must be regular.

552
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
No, it says Xbox 360.

553
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Or in the last month.

554
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I call shenanigans.

555
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Probably the last one.

556
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm hoping a typo then, because...

557
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Yeah, it's got to be Xbox, regular Xboxes or something.

558
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It says Xbox 360, but...

559
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I think it's crap.

560
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
But it says it's based on region, so...

561
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Alright.

562
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Anyways, if you want to contribute to those wonderful sales numbers, there's going to

563
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
be some good stuff coming out this week, especially in the US.

564
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,480
Starting off, if you're a fan of golf, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 will be coming out on PlayStation

565
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:14,200
2, PlayStation 3, 360, Wii, and PSP, along with the DS, I believe.

566
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:20,720
And also, Stuntman Ignition is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 this

567
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
week.

568
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,360
It's actually a pretty fun driving game.

569
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:30,640
If you're into some role-playing games, Wild Arms 5 is coming out on PlayStation 2.

570
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,520
Also on Xbox 360, we have Blue Dragon making its way out.

571
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,800
Let's see here, you happen to be looking forward to Dynasty Warriors, Dynasty Warriors Gundam

572
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
on PlayStation...

573
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,760
Or, I'm sorry, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 will be coming out this week.

574
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:56,800
Other games to note, MotoGP 2007 on the 360, Warhawk on the PlayStation 3, as well as Lair.

575
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,840
Lair is going to be coming out on the 30th, so they kind of bumped it up a week.

576
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:09,720
And let's see, on PC, Left Behind Eternal Forces, the game has been getting some controversy

577
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
there.

578
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,760
As well as the Guild Wars expansion is going to be making its way out, Eyes of the North.

579
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:23,800
And let's see here, also on the Wii, we've got Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, as well as

580
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:30,520
Brunswick Pro Bowling, which is supposed to be also coming out on PlayStation 2 and PSP,

581
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
I believe.

582
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
Okay.

583
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,520
Are any of those games something you guys are picking up?

584
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,800
I definitely will probably pick up Blue Dragon, even though the demo is kind of eh.

585
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,180
And I'll probably pick up Metroid Prime as well.

586
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,280
I'm going to be gone most of the week.

587
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:49,360
I'm holding off on Blue Dragon, because I think I might get a copy anyways.

588
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,240
This one was also interesting, I forgot to mention it.

589
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,120
On PSP, they've got three games that are pretty cool.

590
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,280
Deadhead Fred, which looked pretty cool.

591
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:05,240
And then Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes, and Monster Hunter Freedom 2 looked actually pretty

592
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
good.

593
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,960
Are you going to get any of those games, Dark Saga?

594
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,420
Probably Blue Dragon, but I'll just get down to rent whatever I want first.

595
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
Buy before you buy.

596
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,420
Exactly.

597
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,420
Alright.

598
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,960
Moving on to the Japanese release dates, and what's going on over there.

599
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,400
Hitman Blood Money finally comes out in Japan this week on August 30th on the Xbox 360.

600
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,600
Blade Storm, The Hundred Years War coming out on the PlayStation 3 also this week in

601
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Japan.

602
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,240
$95 if you want to import that sucker into the US.

603
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,080
Long time listeners of our program probably are interested in this release on the PlayStation

604
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,080
2.

605
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,540
Mania 2DX 13th Distorted is coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week.

606
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:52,680
And also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Jintama Jinsan Toishiboku no Kabuki Machiniki.

607
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,120
I love the long, long Japanese titles.

608
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,980
It's an action game, but I don't know, the screenshots of this game look like it has

609
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,880
an awful lot of cinematics for being a little bit of an action game.

610
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,800
Another game coming out on the PlayStation 2 for Marvelous Entertainment, Katai Kiyoshi

611
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,900
Hitman Reborn, Dream Hyper Battle, another action game coming out there on the PlayStation

612
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,160
2.

613
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,280
Coming out also on the PlayStation 2, Yoki Haim Denn in limited edition and regular formats,

614
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,160
an adventure game coming to you from Idea Factory.

615
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,880
And my favorite title of the week, love it, love it, love it, Nintendo DS will see the

616
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,620
release of Love Cat Life will be coming out on the Nintendo DS, and here's the best part.

617
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:38,240
If you look at the box art, it is a complete and utter ripoff of Nintendogs, because you

618
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,760
have the cute little kitties there on the box art, and then it says Love Cat Life written

619
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
in that same format.

620
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Rob.

621
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Rob.

622
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Rob.

623
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
Rob.

624
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
Rob.

625
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
What?

626
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
Rob.

627
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
You want?

628
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Rob, give me baby kitties.

629
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
I can has Love Cat Life?

630
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
I want Love Cat Life.

631
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Love Cat Life needs to come out over here so I can play with the kitties.

632
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Although I want-

633
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Look, the cats sing.

634
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,320
There's a singing competition for the cats.

635
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
They sing.

636
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Yes.

637
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,800
I think you play the, I think you play with them.

638
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,960
This game looks like a complete ripoff of Nintendogs in every way except for this cat.

639
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,520
The doggies don't sing.

640
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
That's a good thing.

641
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,560
Then there's, look, there's a cat rolling around in a toy truck, a little toy dump truck.

642
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
I want to see.

643
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
I want to see.

644
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
That's so cute.

645
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
And let's see here.

646
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,680
A cat looking angry at the food that's been placed in front of them.

647
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
I want to see.

648
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
I'm sorry.

649
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,160
I will post, since I know this makes for great radio, at least for the live folks, I will

650
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,160
copy and paste that into chat so you can take a look at the game.

651
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,800
Jeremy makes that face all the time.

652
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,240
And now you know why.

653
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,360
I don't like this food.

654
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,400
Wake me up when they have lolcats the game.

655
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
They should totally make lolcats the game.

656
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,760
Dude, there are so many fucking animal sim games coming out this fall.

657
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,640
It's not even funny.

658
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,240
I'm looking at the chat room.

659
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,920
D.V. says they should make Nintend ferrets.

660
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,000
Karpakin says no ferret games to be found.

661
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,200
Didn't that come up a couple weeks ago on the show?

662
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
There are ferret games.

663
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,800
I found one and it was on the Nintendo, on the Game Boy.

664
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,160
But it wasn't the ferret a supporting character or something?

665
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,000
No, it was a ferret game.

666
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Let's see.

667
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,640
Gold Banjo said Nintendog clones were doomed to happen.

668
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,520
Yes, and they have been happening.

669
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,320
There was that cats with a Z and dogs with a Z we had here.

670
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,680
But seriously, go look at the box art for this game.

671
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,880
It's a complete freaking ripoff of Nintendogs, but that's not a bad thing.

672
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,080
Here's some of them that I can't remember off the top of my head.

673
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:31,240
Gold Pets with a Z. Dolphins, yes, you can have pet dolphins.

674
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,800
Imagine Babies, that's a pet baby sim.

675
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,880
I kid you not.

676
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:45,160
Imagine Babies with a Z, by the way, because it's edgy.

677
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,320
There's Puppy Love coming out for the Wii.

678
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,840
I remember that one.

679
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,200
Was it Pets, Dogs, and Cats, and Hamster Life 2 or whatever?

680
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
All the sequels to those games from last year.

681
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,800
Okay, one of our frequent guests of Orange L'Entre D'O's back tonight, Mink Latov's here,

682
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,520
fresh from Taco Bell with food.

683
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,360
Thanks for smelling up the crappy food in the room.

684
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,760
What did you want to say about Imagine Babies?

685
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,880
I wonder if it uses that slide sensor that the Nintendo games in Japan use and you could

686
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,360
slide babies around.

687
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,680
It's almost like shaking them.

688
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,360
It'd be so awesome.

689
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,120
Imagine not having babies if you actually buy this game.

690
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,520
I imagine it all the time.

691
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,240
The Imagine Babies series or the Imagine series, I guess, is games meant for girls.

692
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,520
So they have, I kid you not, they have the babies, they have fashion designer, they have

693
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:42,600
a chef, because women need to cook, and then they also had, what was the other one that

694
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
they had that was hilarious?

695
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Oh, pet doctor.

696
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:50,480
I'm thinking my head hurt even more.

697
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,120
I understand now because women should cook, take care of the animals, and have babies.

698
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,280
That sounds like a perfect line up to me.

699
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,320
See, now it's a bummer the webcam isn't working right now because Dark Soccer is giving me

700
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
the finger.

701
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Thank you.

702
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
Appreciate it.

703
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Yes, the webcam broke.

704
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
I hit it with a mallet.

705
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
I screwed up.

706
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
That's a secret.

707
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,000
I hit it with my evil power.

708
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,240
So how about the UK, Rob?

709
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,620
How about the UK?

710
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,120
It's awesome.

711
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,120
Like a hot dog.

712
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,280
Coming out on the 28th.

713
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,400
What if I don't like hot dogs?

714
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,840
Then too after you.

715
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,160
The only type of hot dogs I like are the Costco hot dogs.

716
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,600
The Hebrew International ones.

717
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
Those are really good.

718
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Those are the bomb.

719
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Anyway, sorry.

720
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,560
When we used to work over there.

721
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
You know what?

722
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,400
Let's leave Orange Lounge Radio and create the hot dog podcast.

723
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
That would be awesome.

724
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,120
No, because they are made of lips and thighs.

725
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Ew.

726
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:53,840
Anyway, on the 28th we have Warhawk on PS3, yay.

727
00:35:53,840 --> 00:36:01,840
On the 31st we have Blazing Angels Secret Mission, Boogie, Dragon Ball Z Goku Densetsu,

728
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:10,960
Guild Wars Eye of the North, Stuntman Ignition on PS2 and Xbox 360, Tales of the World Radiant

729
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,360
Mythology on PSP, Tamagotchi Party On, why are there still Tamagotchi games?

730
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,520
Tamagotchi party off, please.

731
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Jeez.

732
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,000
Tamagotchi party's over.

733
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Go home.

734
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,080
Although, you know what I found when I was cleaning, Rob?

735
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
What?

736
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
I found my old Digimon.

737
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Did you really?

738
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Oh my God, that's awful.

739
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,680
Loki, can you paste that artwork in chat so we chatters can see it?

740
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
I will do that.

741
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,640
Loki found the artwork for Imagine Babies, and I swear to God it looks like a Sears catalog

742
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:46,840
photo of this young girl, who can't be more than like 19, holding a young baby who looks

743
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,600
to be about four years old.

744
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,480
That's a big fucking baby.

745
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,040
That's more like an eight month old baby, Rob.

746
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,040
The baby's as big as she is, and the baby doesn't even like, imagine that popping out

747
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,840
of your you-know-wheres.

748
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
That's going to hurt.

749
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
And guess what?

750
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,880
Shane, you'll be happy to know that you can rock the baby, so therefore you can shake

751
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,280
the baby.

752
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,920
Loki, you need to get us a copy of this game for show research.

753
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,920
I will do that.

754
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,760
Rob wants to raise babies.

755
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
That's right.

756
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,800
See, now that we have the Operator 11 stuff, we can have these video shows of us playing

757
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Imagine Babies.

758
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
It'll be fun.

759
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
No.

760
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Super Metroid for the win.

761
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,000
I did Super Metroid as a test show tonight.

762
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,280
That's the one thing that's on stream right now.

763
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
It's hot.

764
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
Well then, can I finish reading the games?

765
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
Oh, sorry.

766
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
Because you distracted me with crap.

767
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
Sorry, my bad.

768
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,720
Um, only one more game on the 31st, we have Worms Open Warfare 2 on PSP and DS, another

769
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:46,120
franchise that, while entertaining while it was new, needs to have that nail in the coffin.

770
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,400
Or at least a chainsaw through the coffin.

771
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,960
That's it.

772
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
All done?

773
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
Africa.

774
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,960
You sure?

775
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,960
You done?

776
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
You sure you're finished?

777
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
My head hurts.

778
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Leave me alone.

779
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Imagine Africa.

780
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
Not sucking.

781
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
Alright.

782
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Ow.

783
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,200
Um, so, yeah.

784
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,420
If you don't want to buy something and you want to kind of play a demo of it, there's

785
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:18,320
a brand new demo for Folklore that's finally made its way out from Japan to both Europe

786
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,200
and the US.

787
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,740
And I've talked about this before.

788
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,740
It's an awesome demo.

789
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,740
You should check it out.

790
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,680
You actually pull the souls of creatures out of their bodies and fight with them.

791
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,640
I didn't like that game, but I didn't understand what the hell was going on when you were playing

792
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
it.

793
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,360
Now that it's in English, it should be a little bit easier to understand, and of course the

794
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:41,400
full game is coming out early October, so check it out.

795
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,160
It's finally nice to see that there's something to download to the Playstation 3.

796
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,160
Hooray.

797
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,800
Well, I know one game a lot of you folks on the Playstation 3 are looking forward to is

798
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,560
the game Lair.

799
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:58,840
And the president of Factor 5, who is creating this game Lair, Julian Egbrecht, gave a very

800
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,320
interesting speech at the recent Leipzig conference going on in Germany.

801
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:10,540
This developer called the ESRB standards and practices a bizarre system, and also called

802
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,960
Lair's certification process a charade.

803
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:18,200
And he said that in order to be approved for a teen rating, they had to cut out a lot of

804
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,440
the blood originally that was in the game, but burning bodies, screaming burning bodies,

805
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,200
that was okay.

806
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:31,520
And Egbrecht went on to kind of say, hey, the MPAA's equivalent rating for movies, PG-13,

807
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,240
permits this much bigger spectrum of violence.

808
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,000
Apparently the ESRB has a taboo against sex in games, especially if you're talking about

809
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,320
homosexuals, and is basically trying to get developers to band together against the ESRB.

810
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,360
Push the violence, push the sex, but push it in an artistic way.

811
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,920
Show that games are art.

812
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,880
Interesting little cheer call from the Lair developer.

813
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,540
Maybe he's trying to get people to buy Lair to support his cause, I don't know, but Lair

814
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,200
looks kind of fun, actually.

815
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,160
More games need more butt sex.

816
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,400
You want more butt sex in games?

817
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,480
Surprise butt sex in games.

818
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,280
I don't know about that.

819
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,680
All right.

820
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,360
So that's all I've got to say on Lair.

821
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,560
I have things to say on other stuff.

822
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,760
Imagine that.

823
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,520
I always have things to say.

824
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
Imagine.

825
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Jamie not having anything to say.

826
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,040
Hey Rob, you know what, shut up.

827
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,800
I'll have you know real quick, there's a ton of funny, imagine, fake box arts that people

828
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
have done.

829
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,520
Like imagine a whore in a bed.

830
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,120
Imagine all my fucking god kittens and domestic violence.

831
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,100
Imagine if you don't eat, everyone will love you.

832
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,840
Is imagine whore in a bed the prequel to imagine babies?

833
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:52,600
No, because the whore just has a bunch of them and she donates them to science.

834
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,920
Wait, that didn't pick up my mic.

835
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,080
Imagine abortions.

836
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,860
You could totally use the stylus in creative ways.

837
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,720
How about imagine abstinence?

838
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,880
Imagine the next story right now.

839
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,320
Hey Rob.

840
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
What?

841
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:13,120
Anyway, so the PSP's on demand video service is out in Europe in 2008.

842
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,480
Isn't that amazing?

843
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,080
It's called Go.

844
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
So you just go.

845
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,600
Hey Jamie.

846
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
Go.

847
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Go.

848
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
No.

849
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Imagine going.

850
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,000
Is that going to be like our new end joke that we're just going to beat into the ground?

851
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's already been done.

852
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,440
I hate to tell you, it's over.

853
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Walk away.

854
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,560
So, what's the big deal about this?

855
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,280
It's a video download service.

856
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,720
It will have a rich selection of high quality entertainment, so it says.

857
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,320
Can I watch Lost on it?

858
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,040
It's basically in conjunction with Sky's On Demand video.

859
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,760
So no, you won't be able to watch Lost on it because you're not in the UK.

860
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
Yeah, Rob.

861
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
Oh.

862
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,760
You can pretend.

863
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,720
Well, can I travel to the UK and download Lost and then come back over here and watch

864
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,400
it?

865
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,360
Only if you live in the UK and can pay for it in the UK and all that.

866
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,880
GS68 in our chat room sums it up really well.

867
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
He says, stop imagining.

868
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,880
There you have.

869
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,600
GS68 also wants to know, can I watch porn on it?

870
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,800
Will there be porn on the On Demand service?

871
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,400
It just says entertainment.

872
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Adult entertainment?

873
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,600
So maybe it's like the Fapperama channel.

874
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,600
I don't know.

875
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,640
That porn older we tonight, 13, 12.

876
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,080
That porn On Demand service that you're looking for is called the web browser.

877
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
Oh, okay.

878
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
Thank you.

879
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,960
It said this would be like sports movies.

880
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
Rated E for everyone.

881
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
Tunes.

882
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
That type of stuff.

883
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
All right.

884
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,760
Well, hooray for the On Demand video service, I suppose.

885
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
And porn.

886
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,200
It would probably be like skin and axe level.

887
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,680
Not very interesting porn.

888
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,320
Well, guess what?

889
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,480
There is something else that kind of go along with the other Go thing.

890
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,680
Go Messenger, because I have to say that that way because there is an exclamation point

891
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:00,160
in the middle of the word there, is a PSP, I mean, voice and video chat service that

892
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,040
will be available also in Europe.

893
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,040
And apparently...

894
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,160
Wait, is there a webcam already out in Europe for you to use with the Go Messenger service?

895
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:18,240
Yes, actually it's called the Go Cam and it's going to be available pretty soon here.

896
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,040
I think some of this stuff is coming over here, but not the Go Messenger.

897
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:29,640
So the Go service not only has Messenger, voice chat, video chat, but it also has movies

898
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,440
On Demand.

899
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:37,080
So it's like an all-in-one thing this Go service has.

900
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
Is that what you're saying, Loki?

901
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Yes.

902
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
All right.

903
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,680
RoboBoy430 in chat wins with this comment.

904
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,080
Agents are Go!

905
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,720
Get it?

906
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Get it?

907
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,080
It wasn't a PSP joke, I'll give you that.

908
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,520
Rob, I need Vicodin to finish the show.

909
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,840
I might have some.

910
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,080
Moving on with other things that Sony has been talking about, this time for the PlayStation

911
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,080
3.

912
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
Guess what?

913
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:07,400
There is a DVR service coming to the PlayStation 3 and this as well is coming to Europe.

914
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
It's called Play TV.

915
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,120
It's going to have two high definition tuners and you can record and play various free TV

916
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,980
channels and there's also the standard definition support.

917
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:22,680
It's going to also use the PSP's remote play features so you can watch live TV and record

918
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,800
TV programs remotely on your PSP over a Wi-Fi connection.

919
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,040
It's going to be first available in the UK, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain with more

920
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,080
PAL territories to follow.

921
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,640
Finally, a reason to have such a big hard drive on the PlayStation 3, yes?

922
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,280
Well in Europe, I'm still waiting for an excuse over here.

923
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,520
Don't you think that it's inevitable this will come out here though or do you think

924
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,800
they're like testing it in Europe?

925
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,120
They're not going to because there's no standardized digital service over here.

926
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,120
D'oh.

927
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,920
So until that happens, we'll still be waiting.

928
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,920
Never.

929
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,720
Well couldn't they team up with one service?

930
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,020
Kind of like, didn't Xbox 360 team up with that new AT&T service?

931
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:04,720
I don't know, but I would think if they're going to do a digital service, do like a satellite

932
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,840
service, because that's supposedly all digital, but I don't know.

933
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,840
All right.

934
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,320
Well also, all digital every week is Dark Sakura's mailbag segment.

935
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Yay.

936
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,200
Now, last week we had to skip the mailbag segment because of the stupid live 365 downtime

937
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,160
and all that stuff that was going on and also we just didn't have a lot of mail last week

938
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,760
so I said please email us and did the listeners email us this week?

939
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,560
Do we get lots and lots of emails?

940
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,560
Yup.

941
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,560
Hooray.

942
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,560
So we have a nice mailbag segment for you guys tonight.

943
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,680
Of course, you can always interact with us by sending mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

944
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,300
your emails and Dark Sakura will open up the mailbag and read some of her favorites so

945
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,300
let's go to it.

946
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,520
Reach in the mailbag and pull something out.

947
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,640
What's there this week, Dark Sakura?

948
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,000
Some stuff.

949
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,760
The first of the emails, dun dun dun.

950
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,800
Hey guys, I really like your idea about picking a game and playing it on air.

951
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,240
You gotta have the game audio on there somehow, especially since Sakura has all the systems.

952
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,040
Have a vote of what games everyone wants you to play each week.

953
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,920
You could even replace the FUs of the week with it.

954
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,920
Pendragon.

955
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,040
Um, no, I need my FUs, but thank you for the idea.

956
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,760
Dear OLR, listening to your ideas for games coming from old movies, I feel compelled to

957
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,520
suggest that several of these studios get together and make a Smash Bros. or Capcom

958
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:27,000
vs. SNK styled fighting game which brings the protagonists from these old classics together

959
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,560
to beat the ever-loving crap out of each other.

960
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,000
Specifically, I wish to see Ewoks fighting the alien cat from the cat from outer space.

961
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,400
Perhaps also Skeletor.

962
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,400
That is all.

963
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,400
Warrior Bob.

964
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,400
Warrior Bob is great.

965
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,400
He's so much fun to hang out with.

966
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,040
I was going to say, backing up to the last email real quick, thanks to our new thingy

967
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,760
on Operator 11, that is definitely a possibility and that was all done on the laptop so I can

968
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,560
haul that thing over to Jamie's house and we can have ourselves some turbo graphics

969
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,600
playing broadcast so we are going to look into doing that in the future.

970
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,600
Yes, Jamie?

971
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,600
Yes.

972
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,600
This must happen.

973
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,600
And it does have the audio.

974
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,720
It's not very good that it does have the audio.

975
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,280
We could have ways around that with proper editing.

976
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,880
There are ways.

977
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,960
We have the technology.

978
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,160
We can build it.

979
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,160
Okay.

980
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,160
If you build it, they will come.

981
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,160
We'll see.

982
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,120
Also, I want to say about the next email, what would you guys want to see in a game

983
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,120
like that?

984
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,280
A Super Smash Bros. game with movie characters.

985
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,120
Chat room, that's open to you guys too, just out of curiosity.

986
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,960
Too bad we already have a topic for tonight's List List.

987
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,960
This will be a good one.

988
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,720
What are you eating?

989
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,720
Ice cream.

990
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,720
That's what I ran out to get.

991
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,200
I want ice cream.

992
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,200
Let's see.

993
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,200
What characters from movies would be good?

994
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,200
How about some of the characters from Kill Bill, of course?

995
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
Brokeback Mountain, Miklotov?

996
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,700
I don't know if that would work.

997
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,800
Who would fight in Brokeback Mountain?

998
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,400
Would the two guys switch out?

999
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,280
There was already a fight in that movie.

1000
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,280
Was there?

1001
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,280
Yeah.

1002
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,280
A little bit.

1003
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,280
Right?

1004
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,280
There was...

1005
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,640
Iron is your special weapon?

1006
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,520
I got food in my mouth.

1007
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,960
Anyway, never mind.

1008
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,960
This is a bad idea.

1009
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,960
Oh, wait.

1010
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,960
We got the chat room.

1011
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,960
Thank God.

1012
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,440
Kerpokken says, Silent Bob.

1013
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,080
DJ Dark Knight says, What about Rinky Bobby?

1014
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,440
Love Nanny Chronic.

1015
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,800
Black Boy says, Rose McGowan from Planet Terror.

1016
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,440
There you go.

1017
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,440
Nice.

1018
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,080
David Bowie from Labyrinth.

1019
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,440
With a special sidekick as Crotch.

1020
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,880
Labyrinth versus Dark Crystal, this must happen.

1021
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,880
Next email, please.

1022
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,480
David Bowie as the king of all cosmos.

1023
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,480
That would work.

1024
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,480
Oh, my God.

1025
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,120
He does sort of look like that now, too, doesn't he?

1026
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,120
He's still hot, though.

1027
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,120
Greetings.

1028
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,040
First of all, thanks for providing such an entertaining podcast on a weekly basis.

1029
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,040
You're welcome.

1030
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,040
Give me a dollar.

1031
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,640
Hey, I'm the one who asks for a dollar every week.

1032
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,040
I listen to it every week.

1033
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,040
Okay, give me five dollars.

1034
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,640
If you're not going to share, don't eat in front of us.

1035
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:00,080
Oh, never mind, it's caramel, and caramel sucks.

1036
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,080
I'd rather have a taco.

1037
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,240
It's dulce de leche, just so you know.

1038
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,720
Yuck.

1039
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,480
Read the email, ladies.

1040
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,960
It's what we pay you to do.

1041
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,160
Shane's making me laugh.

1042
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,160
I can't stop.

1043
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,160
First of all, okay, I already read all that.

1044
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,800
I listen to it every week, and it makes my drive to work that much more tolerable.

1045
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,800
Sorry about this week.

1046
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,800
I hope I didn't run you off the road with- I want to read the email, Rob.

1047
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
I have a bunch of them.

1048
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,800
I want to interrupt you, Jamie.

1049
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,800
I want you to kiss my ass, but not.

1050
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,480
It's fine to follow the email in this conversation.

1051
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,480
No, it is not.

1052
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,480
Shane said it was on the email.

1053
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,480
It is not.

1054
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,480
A little background.

1055
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,160
I have been playing video games for over 28 years.

1056
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,120
I am now 35 and have a family, which probably is a little different from your main audience.

1057
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,640
I also recognize that a lot of the places you guys describe because I'm a Bay Area person

1058
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,640
as well.

1059
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,000
Anywho, I will try to keep this short, famous last words.

1060
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,360
And I don't think you quite accomplished that, but oh well.

1061
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,240
Regarding the discussion of Red Rings on Xbox 360, I completely understand Loki's frustration

1062
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,720
in regards to some fans or fanboys commenting regarding the failure rate.

1063
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:10,500
Countless forums and blogs have perpetuated this 33% failure rate as fact when in reality

1064
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:16,440
is merely a number drawn from a tired interview in Australia with some anonymous XEB game

1065
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,440
employees.

1066
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,440
Someone's ass.

1067
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,440
Yeah.

1068
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,560
While I wouldn't care if fanboys or other systems believe this themselves, I am irritated

1069
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,200
when misinformation is spread around and influenced potential buyers to not buy one because of

1070
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,560
false rumors.

1071
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,240
Of course, I am in an awkward position actually agreeing with Loki as he tirelessly attacks

1072
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,240
the Mac.

1073
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,240
Just kidding.

1074
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,360
I am a Mac fan, though, and even worked for Apple for a time.

1075
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,240
Isn't that amazing how many Mac fans we have that stick with this show even though Loki

1076
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,900
you know, bashes Apple products when he can?

1077
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,900
Your Mac made me want to die last night.

1078
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,640
Just because I don't like them doesn't mean you shouldn't like them.

1079
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,560
I just, I'm giving you my opinion.

1080
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,480
You're like, well, we should all think like you.

1081
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,480
Way to be sheep.

1082
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,480
People, my God.

1083
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,240
Your Mac made me want to die last night.

1084
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:03,080
You know, if you didn't challenge my opinion, then you know, you would just be sheep.

1085
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,640
Why did my Mac make, oh wait, be quiet, Loki.

1086
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,960
Why did my Mac make you want to die last night?

1087
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,040
Because you actually need to put AIM on that.

1088
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,040
Why?

1089
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,040
Use Meebo.

1090
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,040
I hate Meebo.

1091
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,040
I hate you.

1092
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,040
I hate you back.

1093
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,040
Email.

1094
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,040
No.

1095
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,040
You, you were mean to me, Rob.

1096
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,040
I'm going to leave now.

1097
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,040
Bye.

1098
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,040
Do you want some ice cream?

1099
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,040
Yuck.

1100
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,040
What are you trying to do?

1101
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,040
Make my butt bigger?

1102
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,040
Well, can I ice cream?

1103
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,040
Make her read the email.

1104
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,040
Can I finish reading the email?

1105
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,040
We'll see.

1106
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
It's Dolce De Leche.

1107
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,040
Oh, no thanks.

1108
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,040
What the hell is your people's problem with caramel?

1109
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,040
It is gross.

1110
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:37,040
Anyway, can I finish reading the email?

1111
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,040
I suppose.

1112
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,520
Playing online.

1113
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,040
My question for all of you is how much do you truly enjoy playing with strangers online?

1114
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,480
Oh, I love strangers.

1115
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,200
For me, it's a massive turn off.

1116
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,200
I said that, by the way.

1117
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:54,480
No, for me, it's a massive turn off to play with immature jerks constantly, so I have

1118
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,640
set up a small league with people I actually know in person.

1119
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,440
I rarely ever do any online gaming with strangers anymore.

1120
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,600
Honestly, I usually just play with people I know either that or I'm like, no, I don't

1121
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,600
want to fight you.

1122
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,600
Shut up.

1123
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,200
Sometimes I play World of Warcraft.

1124
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,200
Sometimes.

1125
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,200
Keep up the good work, guys.

1126
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,280
Dark Charger.

1127
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,040
I don't like to play with strangers online either.

1128
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,560
My mommy told me not to talk to strangers, especially on Xbox Live.

1129
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,880
Once in a great while, I will, but I totally use that feedback feature if I have to.

1130
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,880
So.

1131
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,880
Okay.

1132
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,360
And which I will not read online as per your request.

1133
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,360
Thank you for your PS.

1134
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,360
Oh, yes.

1135
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,360
I saw that too.

1136
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,200
I'm a rat, especially since, well, my other hobbies.

1137
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,200
Ah, fair dear.

1138
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,200
Yes.

1139
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,200
My other hobbies.

1140
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Anyway.

1141
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,200
Nice email.

1142
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,200
Porn.

1143
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,840
This is from Robert M. Just two quick thoughts.

1144
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:52,200
One, I almost hope Uwe Boll announces plans to make a movie based on Manhunt and is immediately

1145
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,040
sued by You Know Who.

1146
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,480
That particular clash of personalities would likely end in destruction of the career of

1147
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,520
one or both, seeing how neither would back down prior to that point.

1148
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:11,960
Secondly, I was wondering if HMMJDS has only songs from the Disney show or the Hannah Montana

1149
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,200
game or stuff from the average non-fan of the show would recognize.

1150
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:20,680
According to IGN, it does allow you to create your own music tracks, nothing about songless

1151
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,280
though or if play to the present music is even an option.

1152
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,080
I don't know, but I'll try to find out.

1153
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,600
I'd be surprised if it weren't.

1154
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,480
And apparently, oh yeah.

1155
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,480
Is Footy Monster, our resident Hannah Montana fan in chat tonight?

1156
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,480
I do see he is, so maybe he can answer that.

1157
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,160
I don't know.

1158
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:44,120
Nobody loves Hannah Montana more than Footy Monster.

1159
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,120
The next email.

1160
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,120
Hi guys.

1161
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:51,520
MeezerCrazy, I guess that's how it's pronounced here.

1162
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,640
I'm new to your podcast and I think you guys are funny as hell, especially Dark Soccer.

1163
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,640
You crack me up.

1164
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,840
Oh, thank you.

1165
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,160
I crack lots of people up when I have a mallet.

1166
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,160
Anyway, I was wondering if any of you would know if there are any plans for Nintendo on

1167
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:09,120
releasing any Turbografx-16 CD-ROM or Super CD games on the Virtual Console, like Splash

1168
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,440
Lake, Monster Lair or Dracula X.

1169
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,200
Oh God, I love you already.

1170
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,920
Can you think of any Turbo CD games that you'd like to see on the Virtual Console?

1171
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,700
Thanks and keep up the good work.

1172
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:25,040
I'm just going to say MeezerCrazy since he actually put his name in the email.

1173
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:35,160
I would love to see the Valis series.

1174
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:41,320
It was just one of the regular Sega CD games.

1175
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,900
I would actually love to see Sapphire.

1176
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:48,280
It was a game that was one of the arcade CDs.

1177
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,720
It was actually one of the first polygon-based shooters.

1178
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,160
Very, very, very good game.

1179
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,960
I am by no means an expert on these old CD-based systems, so I will simply say Night Trap and

1180
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,960
leave it at that.

1181
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,480
That wasn't even on the Turbografx-16 CD.

1182
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,040
Well, it should have been.

1183
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,320
No, because Night Trap kind of sucked ass.

1184
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,920
Okay, it sucked a lot of ass, but it had Dana Plato in it.

1185
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,040
But I'd love to see Rondo of Blood out there.

1186
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,080
I was a little distracted during that previous email because I was trying to talk to Footy

1187
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:22,200
Monster in the chat room and heard us say his name on the show, but he was too busy

1188
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,360
looking at porn to hear what the question was.

1189
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,400
And Footy Monster did finally, after I clarified with him, he says, it's not known right now

1190
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,280
what music is in the Hannah Montana game, but I'm guessing it will be from the show.

1191
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,520
At least that's what the big hairy guy on the stage said.

1192
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,520
The big hairy guy on the show?

1193
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,360
In the porn or in the Hannah Montana thing?

1194
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,040
Just kidding.

1195
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,780
Okay.

1196
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,780
More email.

1197
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,640
God, there's a bunch of really long ones.

1198
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,640
I can has email?

1199
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,480
Okay, this one says, call me Surtur.

1200
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,480
Okay.

1201
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,880
Hi Surtur.

1202
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,960
Every Monday morning I wake up and my magical PSP has downloaded the latest OLR podcast.

1203
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,160
I can listen to it on the way to work.

1204
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,500
I've been playing Jean Dark.

1205
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,160
It is a strategy RPG based on the Joan of Arc story.

1206
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,320
Who says the PSP doesn't have great games?

1207
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:08,320
I don't know.

1208
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,320
I think I've said that before.

1209
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,080
That would be Shane saying that.

1210
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,760
Thanks again for the show every week.

1211
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,760
PSP sucks.

1212
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,160
Doesn't have good games.

1213
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,160
You were just playing Silent Hill.

1214
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
I know.

1215
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,560
Back that shit up.

1216
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,840
Is it out yet?

1217
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,840
No.

1218
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,840
It does not have good games.

1219
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,920
PSP has a very bright future for it though and a lot of that is thanks to Konami because

1220
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:35,720
of Silent Hill Origins, the Metal Gear game is great and the Castlevania, what the hell

1221
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,720
is it called?

1222
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,720
Akumajo Chronicles or whatever the shit that thing was.

1223
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,720
Yeah.

1224
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,120
Rondo of blah blah blah.

1225
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,120
Alright.

1226
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,120
And Brooktown.

1227
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,120
And Brooktown?

1228
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,120
No.

1229
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,120
No Brooktown.

1230
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,120
No Brooktown.

1231
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,120
K Kland.

1232
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,120
Alright.

1233
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,120
Anyway.

1234
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,540
Hello, this is Kripatkin from Kripatkin and Hendrick's Game Review Show.

1235
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,540
That's cool.

1236
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,540
Hi.

1237
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,540
He's in our chat room tonight.

1238
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,880
And that's the show that's sandwiched in between us when we have our rebroadcast on

1239
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,880
all games.

1240
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,880
That's hot.

1241
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,880
Yes.

1242
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,440
I've been listening to your shows, well, Shavvling 2 and FromWhere, picture of my place

1243
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
of work is below.

1244
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
Okay.

1245
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,880
The email that we use is non HTML, so sorry.

1246
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,040
Nope.

1247
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,160
And thought I'd drop you a line considering the lack of email you've been getting recently.

1248
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:21,780
I'm going to skip on past the location stuff because it says I can't show it.

1249
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:25,840
You know, since this email is coming from a British listener, I think you should read

1250
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,840
this in an accent.

1251
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
No.

1252
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:33,360
No, I'm not, because I'm tired, and I have a concussion.

1253
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,840
I think you should read it within a spot of accents.

1254
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,160
I don't care if you have a concussion.

1255
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,160
Oh, no.

1256
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,120
So, yes, my email topic.

1257
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,720
What do you think is going to...

1258
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:51,840
I don't care how you read it, just read the damn email.

1259
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,840
Excuse me, Shane.

1260
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,840
Hi.

1261
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,840
Then remove him from the studio.

1262
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,960
This is horrible radio.

1263
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,960
Tell Shane to shush.

1264
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,480
Shane shush email now.

1265
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,800
Okay, where was I?

1266
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,840
So, yes, my email topic.

1267
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,920
What do you think it's going to take to stop the gaming industry focus on the six-week

1268
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,600
window at the end of the year to sell games?

1269
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:18,320
This year is just chronic for making, sorry, chronic for amazing titles being squeezed

1270
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,160
into this short period of time.

1271
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,800
Just to give you an idea of how bad it is this year, take a look at the list.

1272
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,180
Super Paper Mario, not out in Europe yet, Metro Prime, and Metro, Metroid Prime 3, Super

1273
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:35,600
Mario Galaxy, Halo 3, PGR4, Assassin's Creed, Crysis, Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Mass Effect,

1274
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,560
Call of Duty 4, Unreal Tournament 3, Ratchet and Clank, Tools of Destruction, World in

1275
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:46,280
Haze, Heavenly Sword, Medal of Honor, Airborne, SEGA Rally, Lost Odyssey, Ace Combat 6, Jericho,

1276
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,480
Enemy Territory, Quake Wars, Two Worlds.

1277
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,840
Do you remember a game called Beyond Good and Evil?

1278
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,000
It was a great game that appeared in Autumn of 2003.

1279
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,120
I do remember that game actually.

1280
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,360
It was buried by many other less entertaining titles and undeservedly ended up in the bargain

1281
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,520
bin.

1282
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:07,360
Makes one wonder which out of the games will suffer a familiar fate.

1283
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,040
As I ask you and the rest of the OLR team, when is the gaming industry going to wake

1284
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:16,960
up and realize that the video games can be released year round and not just near Christmas

1285
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,960
time?

1286
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,420
For what it's worth, my view on it is that when people stop seeing video games as only

1287
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:29,880
being for children games, will cease to be holiday only sale.

1288
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,320
Sadly, I don't see that attitude changing anytime soon.

1289
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,760
Holy nuts, the almighty coin.

1290
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,640
It's Christmas, if they moved Christmas then they could have...

1291
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,320
Just keep up the good work.

1292
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,960
Seriously, I mean...

1293
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,960
It's money, all money.

1294
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,720
It's development cycles I think, but no, if you look at it, of course they want to try

1295
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,320
to get as many sales in before their fiscal years are up.

1296
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:55,160
That's why you see both Christmas and March as big times for games.

1297
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,600
Just look at, right now of course since I sell games at work and stuff, we work on order

1298
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,120
forms and that kind of thing.

1299
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:09,640
For August it was three pages long, for October it's about ten to eleven pages long, and November

1300
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,400
I'm guessing probably around fifteen pages long.

1301
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,520
So that kind of gives you an idea of how much stuff is coming out and it just gets lumped

1302
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:25,520
into that week wherever the fifteenth of November falls and then after that drops down to nothing.

1303
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,800
So it's more of the fault of the soccer moms of America than the gaming industry necessarily,

1304
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,800
right?

1305
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,560
The one day craziness.

1306
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:39,000
But I mean if a good game was released in April, or what's a dead month for gaming?

1307
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,840
April is super dead.

1308
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:46,080
Okay, if a good game is released in April, I mean shouldn't that still translate to good

1309
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,160
sales for the company year round, right?

1310
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,840
Yeah, I mean look at, well this April there was Super Paper Mario and Guitar Hero 2 on

1311
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:57,000
the 360, and those games sold awesome.

1312
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,280
Another example of a slow month July, there was NCAA Football 08, and NASCAR.

1313
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,480
It's Mario Strikers I guess.

1314
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,920
But other than that there wasn't a whole lot.

1315
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:13,840
I mean there's times now during the summer it's like, well shit, there's nothing I really

1316
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:18,820
want to play for a while, whereas in the fall it's like, crap, there's too much stuff, I

1317
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:21,440
don't know what I want to play.

1318
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,280
People aren't going to spend more money towards fall on games.

1319
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,480
I think if they just spread out their releases all year long, it might be better for them.

1320
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,560
Although there are some companies that do that, I mean look at Microsoft and Nintendo,

1321
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,120
they do spread out their releases.

1322
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:41,880
They have about a new game coming out each month, a big AAA game I guess.

1323
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,360
Well still UT made a good point that Dead Rising came out in March and did very well.

1324
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,040
Dead Rising came out in August.

1325
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,040
Really?

1326
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,040
I thought.

1327
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,560
No, I don't remember it coming out late.

1328
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:57,000
Regardless, there's a couple good games that do come out off cycle every year, no matter

1329
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,960
what the specifics are.

1330
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,000
But I was going to say, to me though, games really aren't doing anything different than

1331
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
movies and music.

1332
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,640
I mean look at the movie industry, all the big movies are always out in the summertime.

1333
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,560
And then when do all the crap movies come out?

1334
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,980
After Christmas, like January, February is when, well, sometimes you have the Oscar movies

1335
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,060
trying to push for awards or whatever.

1336
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:20,660
But you know, there's a lot of dead, the same kind of cycle, because when do the consumers

1337
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:24,220
buy most of their movies during the summer when the kids aren't in school, right?

1338
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,640
And then same thing with CDs.

1339
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:28,080
CDs follow a very similar pattern to video games.

1340
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:32,240
All the big CDs come out, what, September, October, November, up to the Christmas season,

1341
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,800
and then when you get into January, it's a dead month for the CD and music releases.

1342
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:41,000
So of course I'm not sure how online distribution changes all that, if at all, but just kind

1343
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
of something to think about.

1344
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,880
Dead Rising was August 9th, 2006.

1345
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,200
Okay, I don't, then what did it say March for?

1346
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,200
It doesn't matter.

1347
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,200
Well, anyway.

1348
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,640
Shall I move on to another email?

1349
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,640
If you must.

1350
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,660
Dear OLR crew, after listening live last week, I went and downloaded the podcast and heard

1351
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:59,880
all the praise for Bioshock go-around.

1352
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,120
If Rob was so convinced to buy it, even though he wasn't a first person shooter kind of guy,

1353
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,360
then by golly, it's something I need to take a look at.

1354
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:10,360
I went and plugged down $200 on a video card the next day and stuck it in my computer,

1355
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,520
and the first thing I did was go and download the Bioshock demo.

1356
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,520
Friggin' amazing.

1357
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:19,000
I need this game right now of the paychecks not being till the end of the month.

1358
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Preclude this.

1359
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,240
Thanks to Rob for convincing me.

1360
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,560
The only complaint I have is the movement is a little sluggish for my taste, reminiscent

1361
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,360
of playing Halo on the PC.

1362
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,680
I was looking for that run button everywhere.

1363
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,060
On the 360, because of the awkwardness of dual analog input, I imagine this allows for

1364
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:38,520
more precision, but I guess I just like my games at faster pace.

1365
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:42,560
I thought the atmosphere was amazing, with the voices and footsteps signaling there was

1366
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,080
something out there that you can't see.

1367
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,600
Chilled me to the bones.

1368
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,760
Of course, my friend who's a complete Counter-Strike addict played the demo and said, I can hear

1369
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,520
them from a mile away, and if they didn't make any noise, it'd be scarier when they

1370
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:53,520
popped out.

1371
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,240
But I think the thrill of knowing there's something out there and you don't know when

1372
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,400
or where it'll come from is better than a cheap pop-out monster thrills.

1373
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,600
I know you guys are Silent Hill fans, so which kind of stimuli gets your adrenaline pumping?

1374
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:25,600
Creepy noises and evil things or jump-out-and-scare-the-crap-out-of-you AZHP?

1375
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:52,600
I would say that the atmospheric scary is way better than the pop-out-of-nowhere scary,

1376
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:58,800
even though in the Silent Hill PSP demo, I did jump a couple times because of the stupid

1377
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:05,040
pop-out-of-nowhere sort of scariness, but I feel that's a cheap thrill, whereas the

1378
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:10,960
noises and just the atmosphere stuff is way better and you are more rewarded with that.

1379
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:20,080
I think I would say that the atmosphere adds to the pop-outs, it makes it even more scary.

1380
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:25,160
I tried to play Bioshock PC, but my video card couldn't handle it, cry?

1381
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:34,360
I have to say that I prefer the atmosphere set up, I really love psychological type horror.

1382
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,760
I don't like the shock value things.

1383
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,560
When people were telling me about Saw and all those, I was like, that just sounds retarded,

1384
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,560
I don't care.

1385
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:43,560
Yeah, that's gross.

1386
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,320
I don't like Saw, but that's different to me.

1387
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,960
I don't think that gross is horror.

1388
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:58,020
I have seen tragedies that gross fits in with.

1389
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:03,800
I think that a good horror movie or game is something that you don't really know it's

1390
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:10,000
meant to be scary, I think, where you think it's just situational and then when something

1391
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,820
completely unexpected happens, not the jumping out, but when you hear the noises and then

1392
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:18,200
you think, oh, well, it's going to be this thing and it turns out to be something completely

1393
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,200
different.

1394
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,720
It's a twist, especially when it messes with your head.

1395
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,720
All right.

1396
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,720
Any more email?

1397
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,720
We've got a long email segment tonight.

1398
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,720
Battle Royale was funny, too.

1399
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,720
Huh?

1400
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:28,720
Nothing.

1401
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,080
I was saying that Battle Royale wasn't scary, it was funny.

1402
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,520
I think Silence of the Lambs is a way better movie than something like Saw.

1403
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,160
Silence of the Lambs is really good.

1404
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,160
But anyway.

1405
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,160
And Nive.

1406
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,440
Hey, OLR, it's me, Solar Wing.

1407
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:44,160
I can't be in the chat tonight as work frowns upon me using their internet for live radio

1408
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,440
stream and such.

1409
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,240
I just wanted to start this off by saying thank you.

1410
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:53,160
OLR saved my sanity and possibly me saying something I'd regret.

1411
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:57,360
I took a short trip out to Alberta to see some family and go back to my past.

1412
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,900
Of course, there was the obligatory meeting of the cousins.

1413
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:06,160
To describe them, they are blonde valley girls who by some chance of nature have more than

1414
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:11,800
one brain cell and can pull high marks out of their pretentious asses.

1415
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:16,520
I brought my DS and my PSP, but I couldn't get the meeting out of my head.

1416
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:24,920
I was going over what I would say in the morning.

1417
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,680
Before I do that, I listened to the podcast I'd previously downloaded.

1418
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:35,440
I brought 21-odd casts and listened to about 8 for a bit, but I was getting more annoyed.

1419
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,700
But then I started to listen to your show and I started to calm down.

1420
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,840
The humor and pacing was perfect for what I needed, which was to calm the hell down.

1421
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,640
I forgot all about the night and simply enjoyed the show.

1422
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:50,400
For that, I'm truly thankful and the only thing that I can suggest is adding the catchphrase

1423
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,240
vehicular homicide is wrong even if they are your cousins.

1424
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:59,960
Vehicular homicide is great, especially if they're your cousins.

1425
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:04,200
I don't understand because how is this show calming because this show has me more on edge

1426
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,200
tonight.

1427
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,360
I think we're distracting.

1428
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:11,360
And if you don't think about the crap that's pissing you off, then maybe you feel better.

1429
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:15,360
Because tonight's show makes me want to do vehicular manslaughter on my cousins.

1430
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,080
Listen to me, Rob.

1431
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,080
You're so mean.

1432
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,080
Whatever.

1433
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,040
Get over it, baby.

1434
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,000
Imagine not being a baby.

1435
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Alright.

1436
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,440
Are there more emails?

1437
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,440
No, there's just this one.

1438
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,280
Oh my god!

1439
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,000
How many freaking emails did we get this week?

1440
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,960
You do know we like to finish the show in like three hours, right?

1441
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,960
I'm reading the rest of this.

1442
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:38,960
Hush.

1443
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:39,960
Alright.

1444
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:40,960
Rob.

1445
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:41,960
No.

1446
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:46,920
To bring this back to video game talk, before I left for my trip, it's tradition I buy a

1447
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:52,120
new game, so I've been holding out and getting Phoenix Wright 2 as I've never played the

1448
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,120
first one.

1449
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,240
I would like to play them in order.

1450
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:58,100
I picked it up but didn't open it while I was out there and had a chance to go around

1451
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,560
the area and found an EB.

1452
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:06,260
We went in and I found the first Phoenix Wright for less than $50.

1453
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:09,080
It was the lowest bidding off of eBay before I left.

1454
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,560
It was actually $34 Canadian with tax.

1455
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,360
Alberta only has like 6% tax compared to 15%.

1456
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,800
So I picked that up and have almost beaten it.

1457
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,840
This game is at least a must rent if you have a DS.

1458
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,760
From there we went to the West Edmonton Mall and I found ourselves in an arcade where for

1459
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,040
the first time I saw Guitar Freaks in Dramania.

1460
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:33,160
I can now agree that Guitar Hero wasn't original but did a lot of things right.

1461
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,080
Now listening to the last week's show, I have some questions for you.

1462
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:45,260
The Smash Bros. site has been updating their site daily and I only have to say I can't

1463
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:50,160
wait for this game to come out but do you think they will have online in it?

1464
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:55,000
In my opinion it would be Sonic and Tails.

1465
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:02,380
I'm so sorry Solar Wing, you're great but your emails use punctuation please.

1466
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:07,520
And non-sentences are very very hard to follow.

1467
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,680
Now I know why when I read the email you said I'm like Jamie when I was yelling about their

1468
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,560
grammar and stuff.

1469
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,680
As much as I'd like to see online, I think there's going to be as much online as there

1470
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:25,760
is punctuation in this email.

1471
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,240
I wish they would go online with it and I wish maybe that would be like a big surprise

1472
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:35,480
Nintendo is going to pull out of their butt come the end of the year.

1473
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:38,720
Maybe it will be a big E for All announcement since nobody else is going to announce anything

1474
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,720
in E for All.

1475
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,720
I don't know.

1476
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,280
But I'm not holding my breath.

1477
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,560
Super paraphrasing powers activate!

1478
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,120
Okay, yes.

1479
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,000
This one's for you and me, Rob.

1480
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,020
Since we both played Ragnarok online, which I think is funny to being referred to, aka

1481
01:10:54,020 --> 01:11:01,200
Fisher Price, my first MMORPG, he and his sister are crippling RO addiction and they're

1482
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:06,760
on the way to the 13 steps.

1483
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,880
What is a good MMO to play?

1484
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:13,640
She suggested World of Warcraft, but she says it looks complicated.

1485
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,120
World of Warcraft is not that complicated.

1486
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,120
Try Rose Online.

1487
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:21,560
I don't know that one.

1488
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,640
It's another Gravity game, sort of Ragnarok-y.

1489
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,200
Actually, Ragnarok 2 is out in beta.

1490
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,280
Kingdom of Loathing.

1491
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,280
Puzzle Pirates.

1492
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,880
Yeah, Puzzle Pirates might be fun for that if you like puzzles and stuff and it's pretty

1493
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:35,880
easy to get into.

1494
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,680
I mean, I didn't care for it, but you might like it.

1495
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:39,680
It's kind of fun.

1496
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,000
Like, if you like the PopCappy-type games, you'd probably like Puzzle Pirates.

1497
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Tetranet!

1498
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
No.

1499
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,600
Kingdom of Loathing would be great, though, because of all the monsters that have misspellings.

1500
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,000
I forget, it was like the cemetery or something where everything was misspelled, all the monster

1501
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
names.

1502
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
That's fantastic.

1503
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
So.

1504
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Funny.

1505
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Okay, that's it.

1506
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,920
Darknight in chat, by the way, suggests a Phantasy Star universe or Guild Wars.

1507
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,120
PSU is crap.

1508
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:07,280
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

1509
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:12,000
I suggest if you're going to play one of the Phantasy Star MMOs, go for Blue Burst because

1510
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,120
it's a lot better and you can actually use a force in that game without having to retardedly

1511
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,120
crap it.

1512
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,120
Crap it!

1513
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,640
Darknight says, stop hatin'.

1514
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,800
I can hate all I want to.

1515
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,800
It's a free country.

1516
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,800
I want to play a better game.

1517
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,800
That was great.

1518
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,760
Shane says to play a better game.

1519
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:34,160
So he wants our Wii codes, but we'll have to put them back up.

1520
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,280
Anyway, I can't read any more of this email.

1521
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,560
I'm sorry, Solar Wing.

1522
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,560
Was that the last email?

1523
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,080
Yeah, that was the last email.

1524
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,080
Hooray!

1525
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,080
We can move on with the show.

1526
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,520
Hooray!

1527
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,520
Let's see here.

1528
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,040
I mean, you should email us sometime.

1529
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,040
Mailbag at orangeontario.com.

1530
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,840
We'd love to hear from you, just not all in the same week.

1531
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:53,840
I'll email us.

1532
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,840
It will be.

1533
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,840
Jamie is awesome.

1534
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:02,400
Well, anyways, now I have news on an upcoming retro compilation now.

1535
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:06,440
I know you might be going, ugh, retro compilation, who wants that?

1536
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:11,800
Well, this is the Atari Classics Evolve, and I think this is kind of how you do a retro

1537
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,640
compilation.

1538
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:20,520
Not only do you get eleven classic Atari arcade titles, like Asteroid Battlezone and stuff,

1539
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:28,560
in both the original and evolved versions, but you get sixty Atari 2600 classics.

1540
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,120
That's right, seventy games in one.

1541
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,120
Hell yeah.

1542
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,120
That's a lot of games.

1543
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,240
That is a lot of games.

1544
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:39,080
I want seventy versions of Metal Slug.

1545
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,960
There probably will be someday.

1546
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,840
Give it time.

1547
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,840
One day.

1548
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:44,840
One day.

1549
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:53,240
But some of the eleven evolved classics in it, they are seeing, let's see here, Yars

1550
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:58,400
Revenge, Night Driver, Canyon Bomber, Crystal Castles.

1551
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,800
Crystal Castles is great.

1552
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,040
Crystal Castles is pretty rad.

1553
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:06,000
But I don't know, I feel like a lot of these classics, I've already played Death elsewhere.

1554
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I don't know.

1555
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,280
I don't know if I can get that excited about it.

1556
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,440
Oh, I'm sorry, those weren't the evolved titles.

1557
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,280
Those are just some random titles they were saying.

1558
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,920
Can I play over the internet or with other people?

1559
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:21,120
You can play with other people Wi-Fi, and they also have an online leaderboard.

1560
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,120
What else?

1561
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:26,400
Actually, it says, oh yeah, you can just compare scores.

1562
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,920
I was going to say, hopefully it has it over the internet.

1563
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:35,560
The evolved titles, I guess, Asteroids, Asteroids, Deluxe, Battlezone, Centipede, Lunar Lander,

1564
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:41,040
Millipede, Missile Command, Super Breakout, Tempest, Warlords, and Pong.

1565
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,480
Wow, super evolved Pong.

1566
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,480
I can't wait for that.

1567
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,480
Hey, they had Tempest in there.

1568
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,480
Yeah, Tempest is cool.

1569
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:52,400
I saw you playing Space Giraffe earlier, Miklotov, while we were done, so what did you think?

1570
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,560
I couldn't tell if it was really a game or an interactive screensaver, because I didn't

1571
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,360
know what I was doing most of the time.

1572
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,040
It's just really, really colorful, and it wasn't fun.

1573
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,160
It's hard to see a damn thing in it, isn't it?

1574
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:09,080
There's like the one enemy that's really easy to see, and then everything else is just the

1575
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,200
background that apparently hurts you sometimes.

1576
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:19,360
All right, well, how about, speaking of lists, there's some new tracks that are coming out

1577
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:23,680
for the upcoming music games Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3.

1578
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:30,680
Guitar Hero 3 has gotten some international tracks and some tracks from all around.

1579
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:38,840
Ten new songs were announced this week, including Ruby by the Kaiser Chiefs, Radio Song by Super

1580
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,520
Bus, and Minus Celsius by the Backyard Babies.

1581
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,320
I've not heard of a lot of these bands, but apparently it's some more international flavor,

1582
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,320
so hooray for diversity.

1583
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,440
Wait, wait, wait, what was the first one that you mentioned?

1584
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,440
Kaiser Chiefs.

1585
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,640
That's the only one I've heard of from the list.

1586
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,640
No, that you mentioned.

1587
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,640
Sorry, it must have been the second one then.

1588
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,640
Oh, hell.

1589
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,880
Yeah.

1590
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:58,880
I closed the list.

1591
01:15:58,880 --> 01:15:59,880
Don't worry about it.

1592
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,880
Super Bus.

1593
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:01,880
That was it.

1594
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:02,880
That's pretty cool.

1595
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:03,880
All right.

1596
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:09,680
Now coming to Rock Band, some songs you might know a little more in-depth stateside, such

1597
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:15,320
as the Rolling Stones with Gimme Shelter, The Clash, Should I Stay or Should I Go, Smashing

1598
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:20,440
Pumpkins with Cherub Rock, Nine Inch Nails, The Hand That Feeds, Beastie Boys, Sabotage,

1599
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:23,600
and one of my favorites, Radiohead with Creep.

1600
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:29,700
Because I'm a creep, I'm a winner.

1601
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:33,080
I'm not playing Rock Band with you on that song, if you're going to take the mic and

1602
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,080
do that.

1603
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,320
You know what I think would be better than Creep for Radiohead songs?

1604
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,320
My Iron Lung.

1605
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,320
What?

1606
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,320
How about Fake Plastic Trees?

1607
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,320
No.

1608
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,320
That's not a Rock Band song.

1609
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,320
It's not a Rock Band song.

1610
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,320
I just like that song.

1611
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,320
Radiohead.

1612
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:46,320
It's emo.

1613
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,320
It's emo at its finest.

1614
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:50,120
But My Iron Lung is like a perfect combination.

1615
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,760
Anyway.

1616
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,560
I like Cherub Rock in the game.

1617
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,560
I like Smashing Pumpkins.

1618
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:58,720
Well, Smashing Pumpkins is cool, I guess.

1619
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:03,080
So speaking of Guitar Hero 3, though, moving on to other games that are trying to be like

1620
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:10,100
other games, Guitar Hero 3 is going to have a demo inside the Xbox 360 version of Tony

1621
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,720
Hawk's Proving Ground.

1622
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:18,800
It actually will be released in the UK on October 9th, and the demo will be included

1623
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,300
with it before it makes it onto Xbox Live.

1624
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:29,160
So they're saying that what's going to be listed is Laid Down by Priestess, Even Flow

1625
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:34,760
by Pearl Jam, The Metal by Tenacious D. I love Tenacious D. Hit Me With Your Best Shot,

1626
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:41,360
As Made Famous by Pat Vanitar, and a cover of Rocky Like a Hurricane.

1627
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,560
What are the scorpions doing anyway?

1628
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,360
Why can't they just use the tracks?

1629
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,360
Stinging people?

1630
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,360
No.

1631
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,360
God.

1632
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:57,560
Well, that's great news, but here's something even funnier.

1633
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:06,040
In the ongoing battle between Sony and, I guess, PSP hackers over firmware control,

1634
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:07,320
who will dominate?

1635
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:13,580
I think the hackers may have actually launched the final blow.

1636
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:19,320
There is a brand new application being released out there called Pandora's Battery.

1637
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:25,360
What this is, actually, say for example you have a PSP that got fucked up and broke, and

1638
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,080
you send it back to Sony.

1639
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:31,840
The way they reset them is they have a Sony battery that triggers the PSP to go into a

1640
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:37,240
service mode, and then they can reset the whole thing, and away you go.

1641
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,560
Well, this does something very similar.

1642
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:44,640
It allows you to hack the battery's firmware to actually create your own debug battery,

1643
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:53,280
so with that and a combination with a PSP memory stick, you can downgrade, you can unbrick

1644
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:59,680
any PSP, no matter the firmware, so that's pretty awesome.

1645
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,760
It will downgrade anything to 1.5.

1646
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:07,760
If you have a bricked PSP from failed whatever, it will fix it.

1647
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,920
Now how much is this puppy going to cost?

1648
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:10,920
Nothing.

1649
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:11,920
It's free to download.

1650
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,920
Yeah.

1651
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,160
I mean, you download the program, you run it on your PC.

1652
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:21,240
All you need is a PSP battery to create this debug battery.

1653
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:27,220
You can turn the battery back to its normal mode afterwards, if you'd like.

1654
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:31,320
The only thing you will need, though, is to create this device.

1655
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:36,160
You will need one of the custom firmwares, but if you have a friend that has that, you

1656
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:39,040
create this, and then you're good to go on any PSP.

1657
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,040
Hooray!

1658
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,040
Kid Icarus on my PSP again!

1659
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,040
Yay!

1660
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,040
Who knows?

1661
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:51,840
This will be interesting when the new PSPs come out, the Slims, but then again, I think

1662
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,760
if you downgrade it, you're going to lose all that video out capability.

1663
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,760
Time for a new firmware.

1664
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:58,760
Interesting.

1665
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,280
It's always interesting to see kind of the back and forth between the hacking community

1666
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:07,360
and then the official stuff, and I can understand Sony wanting to stop the piracy and people

1667
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:13,040
posting the games on the internet and all that stuff, but show a little homebrew love.

1668
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,040
Little bit.

1669
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,040
Little bit.

1670
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:19,080
All right, anyhow, moving on to a title that was creating a lot of news in recent weeks

1671
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,020
on the program, Manhunt 2.

1672
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:25,000
A lot of folks thought this game was dead in the water, it's going away, no more are

1673
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,640
we going to see this because you just can't fix the game down from an AO rating.

1674
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:31,640
Well guess what?

1675
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:36,940
It has been modified down to an M-rated version, and Manhunt 2 will be out on the PlayStation

1676
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:42,520
2, PSP, and Wii on Halloween, October 31st, 2007.

1677
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,840
What a hilarious day to release this game.

1678
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,840
Awesome.

1679
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,400
A quote from Rockstar founder and president Sam Houser, quote, Manhunt 2 is important

1680
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:53,600
to us and we're glad it can finally be appreciated as a gaming experience.

1681
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:58,320
Manhunt 2 is a powerful piece of interactive storytelling that is a unique video game experience.

1682
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,840
We think horror fans will love it.

1683
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,960
Nowhere though has it been said what exactly they had to change.

1684
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:09,600
I mean, obviously they've scaled down some of the violence, perhaps, but as to specifics,

1685
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,560
your guess is as good as mine.

1686
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,120
They added bunnies.

1687
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,920
I hope all they did was submit a different video to the ESRB, because-

1688
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,100
Well they have to play the game, don't they now?

1689
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:27,760
When I was still at Konami, we still just did videos, so who knows, I hope they don't

1690
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,840
have to cut anything because I want that game.

1691
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,920
What they did is they changed all the blood to sweat- Or all the blood to fire, remember,

1692
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,020
because it's okay to burn people alive, it's just not okay to have them bleed.

1693
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:42,720
But there will be a secret blood code in the game that will restore all the blood from

1694
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:43,720
the original demo.

1695
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:46,440
As will unlock a sex mini-game as well.

1696
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:51,220
Yes, and you can use your game genie to change the colors of the sweat as well to make the

1697
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:55,240
experience that much more realistic.

1698
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,240
But sweat is great.

1699
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,240
It is.

1700
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:01,040
You know what I always thought was funny is that, because I've got the Samurai Shodown

1701
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:06,280
2 out of the Japanese cart for my Neo Geo, if you switch it from Japanese to English

1702
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:08,520
mode the blood changes color.

1703
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,480
I'm not even joking.

1704
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:14,160
You have the big spray of sweat, and then you change it as the big spray of blood.

1705
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:18,240
If I developed video games, I would actually put a code that changes the blood into sweat

1706
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:23,040
just to be funny, like to make reference to the old school Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat.

1707
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,440
That was fantastic.

1708
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,840
Okay, anyway, how about something regarding Eidos?

1709
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,840
Okay.

1710
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:32,240
And something that I love, which is Highlander.

1711
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:38,280
Because however many shows are based off of cutting people's heads off.

1712
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,280
Not too many.

1713
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,160
Not a lot that I can think of.

1714
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:43,160
Buffy, kind of.

1715
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,840
That's staking or cutting their head off.

1716
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,840
One and a half.

1717
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,840
One and a half.

1718
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,840
I agree with that.

1719
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,840
I love Buffy.

1720
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,360
Angel, not so much because he was a whiny bitch.

1721
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,040
Okay, moving forward.

1722
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:00,440
There is going to be a Highlander game that is going to be...

1723
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,440
Call him.

1724
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,440
What?

1725
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,440
Sorry, never mind.

1726
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,440
What?

1727
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:07,480
I was trying to add sound effects, but forget it.

1728
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:09,480
Stop farting in the microphone.

1729
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,480
Anyway.

1730
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,400
There can be only one.

1731
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,400
Okay.

1732
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,120
It will be on PS3, 360, and PC.

1733
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:27,160
It's a third person action game that will cross 2000 years from feudal Japan, from Scotland

1734
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:34,720
in the old days, Pompeii, New York in the future, and you go all over the place cutting

1735
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,720
off people's heads.

1736
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:39,640
Sadly, I think this is going to be timed with a new movie that's coming out.

1737
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:43,840
Yeah, they're making another Highlander movie.

1738
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,360
I hope that with his face you can end it, because that man is blind.

1739
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,360
He almost killed everybody.

1740
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,360
Do you understand?

1741
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,840
Stop it, Rob.

1742
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:52,840
You can use...

1743
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,400
I am Colonel McCloud of the Clan McCloud.

1744
01:23:54,400 --> 01:24:00,840
I was born in 1518 in the village of Glenfinnan on the shores of Loch Siel, and I am immortal.

1745
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:07,880
Okay, my favorite line in the first one is when he keeps calling Ramirez an overblown

1746
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:08,880
haggis.

1747
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:15,720
I am Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez, chief metallurgist to King Charles V of Spain, and

1748
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,880
I'm at your service.

1749
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,560
Why does he sound Scottish if he's Spanish?

1750
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,560
I love Spanish.

1751
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,560
It also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head.

1752
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,560
The head, which is this time, has no name.

1753
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,560
I know his name.

1754
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:41,040
His name is Mr. Heady.

1755
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:49,160
You play Owen McCloud, and you fight 77 other people, and you have 18 missions so far.

1756
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:54,940
You get to play with zip wires, daggers, free falls, swan dives.

1757
01:24:54,940 --> 01:25:00,160
It will be pretty gory, pretty mature.

1758
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:08,360
And also, you have a choice of three weapons, like a tana, claymore, or a, I guess, double?

1759
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,360
On the Wii?

1760
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,360
On the Wii?

1761
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,360
I can actually slice people's...

1762
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:14,360
It's like, well, I said from the beginning, PS3 360 or PC?

1763
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,360
Doh.

1764
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,240
But you also get powers.

1765
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,200
I don't remember any of them having actual powers.

1766
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,200
Alright.

1767
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,480
Other than, oh my god, I sense danger.

1768
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:24,560
It's another immortal.

1769
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,860
Let's kill him.

1770
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:26,860
Alright.

1771
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:29,880
Well, let's go ahead and take a quick break.

1772
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,720
This segment's ran on long enough, that's for sure.

1773
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,280
We're gonna take a quick break, and when we come back from this break, more of Orange

1774
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:38,840
Launch Radio with our part B. We're gonna talk a little bit about Metroid Prime 3, a

1775
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:44,760
little bit about Super Mario Galaxy, the penny arcade game for Xbox Live Arcade, and a list

1776
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:45,960
list for tonight.

1777
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:50,960
Oh boy, we'll be right back with more after this of Orange Launch Radio.

1778
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:55,360
Orange Launch Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1779
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,360
a week.

1780
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:09,320
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Launch Radio.
