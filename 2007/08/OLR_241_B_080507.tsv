0	5580	And welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio here on this lovely Sunday evening August the 5th of
5980	11580	2007 if you missed part a our show is a little bit in limbo tonight or a little bit broken first off
11580	13080	We have no Jamie tonight
13080	15320	She's unfortunately had a family emergency
15320	20420	so we all are of course thinking I'm about her at this time and and definitely we'll be seeing her next week after she's
20940	22940	got all that taken care of and
23240	25240	Also, we're in temporary studio
25400	29700	Obviously we weren't here last week because we were moving and we thought the new place would be up and running this week
29700	32760	However, the unfortunate thing is thanks to Comcast
32760	37940	We have no internet at the new place because you have to wait like two weeks to get an appointment if you're an existing customer
38680	44000	So it takes forever. So we're here from the temporary studio Loki and that's where we are tonight
44000	47280	So if you notice a lot of our usual sound effects are missing or we kind of sound different
47280	50240	That's a big reason why but we're really excited about the new studio
50240	54120	It's gonna be so much more space than before. I'm just worried about it is a garage
54120	59620	It's an insulated garage, but I'm just worried about the heat issues, but we'll worry and the echo
59620	63480	Cuz it's got a bad echo problem, too. We'll see we're gonna try and make it work by next week
63480	68140	So we're hoping to pull through for you for episode number 242 in the meantime
68140	74560	Let's get back into some gaming news and we're going to start off with some big news on the Xbox 360 big big news on
74560	76240	the Xbox 360
76240	80900	The $50 price break has been all but confirmed by Circuit City
81300	88440	Circuit City has put a brand new flyer out there that shows that there is a price drop on all the systems the elite coming down
88440	94720	To $449 the premium coming down to $349 and the core system coming down to $279
95080	101560	What should also be noted is that the premium system the three now $349.99 system is going to include
102200	105800	Rockstar table tennis so you get a free game with it now, which is pretty awesome
106040	110480	Even if the game is really only 20 bucks because Rockstar table tennis was cut down in price
110520	112760	That's better than no game at all, right?
112760	120760	That is true, and they're still you know denying that they have a price cut coming, but I think we know better than that
121920	128600	Usually Microsoft rumors end up to be true. Yes, and of course you know that's made its rounds all over the internet
129640	133680	Except that's you know not the only announcement coming this week
134920	139640	Probably by now by the time you download this podcast you will have heard that all the new
139640	143760	360 systems coming out as of this week and
144880	146880	into infinity I guess
147600	149600	Will now all have HDMI
150200	151520	so
151520	157360	Don't have to spend the big bucks for the elite even the core even the core system will have my theory of the core system
157800	162200	that's that's totally baseless other than the fact that I
163280	166560	Just feel that not a lot of people are buying the core system
166560	170880	And there's some other stories that kind of collaborate that later in the show wait a minute
170880	175200	So I don't understand how that works how what about all the systems that are already out there?
175200	179600	Are they gonna be coming off the shelves to make room for these HDMI enabled machines or what's gonna happen?
179600	186560	No, it's just they'll have this extra SKU out there, and I don't know maybe they'll drop the price even more
187360	192120	Huh very interesting so it's gonna have all HDMI on it so now
192120	197360	I was that to be competitive with PlayStation 3 or is that because too many people were bitching about the elites
197480	202440	Is the only way to go to get that I mean if you think about it's not a big surprise because look at the you know
202440	203560	halo
203560	206440	3 system I mean that's supposed to be coming out in
207440	209240	September here, and it's not a big surprise
209240	214240	That's why they haven't announced the price for that yet if you think about it because you know people be like well
214240	219680	Hey, you know isn't that supposed to if they announced it like 399 or something or 349 or whatever?
219680	226600	People say hey, why would I want to buy a premium system like buy the halo one for you know the same price with?
227240	231120	HDMI now Alex Silvara in chat has a very excellent point
231120	233840	I was thinking the same thing when I first heard this is that hmm
233840	237760	I need to figure out how to red-ring my premium so I can get an HDMI model a
238760	240240	hammer
240240	246000	No, but seriously like you know could you use that warranty to your advantage like somehow for sure 360 to give you the red rings
246040	248160	So when they send you a refurb it has HDMI
248160	251640	well, you could wrap a towel around it and
253520	257720	You know play it in another try to overheat it place it in an oven
259200	264880	No, but I don't know what I'm not recommending that you do that, but you know I'm just saying
266000	270320	And no one this is not a real big deal because you know the systems are out there right now
270320	273680	They don't have HDMI, but who cares I mean I guess
273680	279200	It sucks if you already bought one, but you know for like a person like me. I don't have any HDMI TV
279200	283760	I could care less so I know is HDMI really that big a deal
283760	288720	I mean because I have a feeling the Internet's gonna make this story this week and sound like this big huge
288720	294000	Frickin deal other thing is it I'm guessing it will not have an HDMI cable with it either
294160	299000	But the reason why is because there will be a cable. It's coming out as well all this is gonna be
299480	303080	You'll probably all know this by the time you hear the pod yes
303080	310720	So hmm you know because it also of course there was that GameStop thing the leak to the internet that said you know the
310840	315040	announcements gonna be made by the 8th or Wednesday, so
317080	319480	Yeah Wow not a big surprise, but
320400	325560	Well, you know this kind of supplements what Loki was saying earlier about possibly the core is going away completely
326480	327680	apparently
327680	335040	Xbox there's rumors going around that Microsoft has plans to make a hard disk drive a requirement to play games in other words that think
335040	339720	One Sega game a little while back had a long time ago. It was seeing a more game. It was on
340400	344720	Yeah, Sega Pro soccer or something or other out some soccer
345760	351120	Sim thing well that the hard disk drive will actually be required for some later games
351640	354280	That was on the early pack shot to for Call of Duty 4
354280	358720	They now you might remember that the original Xbox they all had hard drives
358720	362200	And they would use the hard drive to their advantage it would take data off the disk
362440	366580	Uncompress it and then put it on the HD H drive hard drive temporarily
366920	368840	And so basically the loading times are smaller
368840	375440	And if you've ever played oblivion without a hard drive versus with a hard drive very similar type of concept there of course no official
375440	377800	announcement announcement from Microsoft as of yet
377800	385120	But rumors are around and Microsoft rumors usually end up to be true usually unless it's like completely off-base
385640	390480	But I wouldn't see this as being completely off-base. I could I could see this being a reality yeah
390480	390960	I mean
390960	395200	I don't know many Xbox 360 owners without a hard drive unless they are seriously only
395440	399160	Buying a 360 for Madden or only buying it for select games
399160	408160	You know very very casual types of 360 gamers any I think hardcore gamer with a 360 probably has a hard drive. Yeah
409640	413880	So also this week you know that was very sorry
413880	416440	I just want to go chat really really quick because some good points here
416600	424120	Ross deal UT says of course Final Fantasy 11 another very big game that requires a hard drive on the Xbox 360 of course hello
424120	430200	I wonder doc Harold would like to point out HDMI is a big deal when you spend $2,000 on the TV
431960	434320	Raving he bought a TV that was like $2,000
435040	439000	Ravens dolphin says orange on its radio enforces bricking Xbox 360s
439000	439240	No
439240	445640	We do not encourage you to break your 360s because there's no guarantee you're gonna get one replaced with HDMI
445840	449800	Son of dad is being very bold says HDMI is a big deal for snobs
449800	457080	Hmm the other thing I'd like to mention though that table Rockstar table tennis bundle. That's out there
457200	459680	It's not the first time we've seen that actually
460560	464820	Around January of this year. There's a few retailers out there
464820	470640	This was offered to retailers as a way to sell systems, and it wasn't the only one fact
470640	477000	I double-checked it on the ad that I saw and the part numbers match exactly so
477000	482240	There's three different skews that they have they have Rockstar's table tennis top spin to
482440	487600	Which both of those have kind of leaked out on the internet now and amp 3 was the last one that they had that
487800	491600	I didn't see anyone having that but then again the games out of print also, so
492440	496520	It wouldn't surprise me though if they maybe Ridge Racer. That'd be kind of cool
496520	500440	But those three I know were being sold in January as well
500440	505520	So that's probably also why that the one that they did leak with top spin to I think
505520	507320	Had a price of $3.99
507320	512080	Because that's the old skew um and and three those kind of an old game though
512080	517960	I mean it is see that being super popular it is, but I mean top spin to I mean I'm not really
518480	520480	Tennis yay
520480	525520	Top spin game wasn't even that great topspin to wasn't even that great. I do like really games
525520	527520	I didn't like that one, so sorry to say
528400	532120	Now this is kind of interesting because you remember last week or two weeks ago
532120	535600	We were here back back here on the show we were talking about halo on the DS
535600	538120	We talked about like how Microsoft games could they really come out for the DS
538120	540640	And I think even one of the emails are gonna get to later gets into this
540640	546720	But it should be noted that at comic-con during a viva pinata panel of both things all things
546720	548720	Did you go to the viva pinata panel at comic-con?
548720	557200	She totally didn't I figured rare has actually announced. They are going to be releasing a Nintendo DS version of viva pinata
557200	562240	So kind of interesting they're rare is actually developing it developing it themselves
562240	564880	It's not a copy of the Xbox 360 game. It's different
565480	569240	Gameplay wise they say it's the same game, but it is going to be a different game
569760	576200	So kind of interesting because that's weird because rare is obviously a Microsoft subsidiary now
576200	577960	And now they're putting out a game on the Nintendo DS
577960	584200	But at the same time it makes a lot of sense if Xbox is not getting into the handheld realm anytime soon lots of kids
584200	589320	Have Nintendo DS's and viva pinata of course is not just a game on the 360, but a cartoon series
589320	595200	So you know they're trying to draw in the kids and make it like a new Pokemon type thing so I'm wondering who's my who's
595200	600040	Gonna be publishing this game is it gonna be Microsoft because that would be interesting if it's Microsoft
600560	605040	Publishing it or if it's actually gonna be rare developing it and Nintendo publishing it
605680	607160	Who knows?
607160	611400	Who knows I don't think it says here. I go. I guess it says the the
611400	615560	Article says it sounds like Microsoft is publishing it, but I don't think we know that for sure just yet
615560	617560	And I could be wrong though
619240	621240	Anyways
621640	630200	So another thing also that's very interesting kind of little weird the new X&A package for PC
630680	633560	You might remember Microsoft's kind of game development kit
634280	638600	Actually has support for Wiimotes for inputs for using that
638600	643880	So that's a little interesting that you can make gestured controlled games for windows-based
644840	646840	PCs
647480	653720	Wait so I mean because people with XNA can play these games that they make on their Xbox 360 correct
654040	657160	Yeah, so in other words people are gonna be able now
657160	662680	They're gonna have viva vignette on the DS and they can build games that use the wiimotes not necessarily
662680	669720	They have different libraries for both the PC and the 360 so it's not gonna allow you to play
669720	671720	You know Wii games are like, you know
672520	676920	Games that use the Wii remote on your Xbox 360, but you can play them on your PC
676920	680040	Oh, that makes sense because I was gonna say how can you plug in that infrared bar?
680040	684680	You can't it just it's just the wiimote and the sensors that are in that the accelerometers
684680	689960	No, I really need to plug in the bar anyways, because it's just two infrared lights. I guess that's true
689960	693880	That's still kind of interesting, but it doesn't have bluetooth on it
693880	698600	So, you know, it'd be a little hard to connect those we remotes to the system
699240	704360	Ross deal UT in our chairwoman like to point out Microsoft is published for DS before there was a mech assault game for it
705320	711080	So there you go and Ross do UT also says this only proves that Microsoft is smart enough to stay the fuck away from the portable
711080	713080	Market, there you go
713640	715240	Ravens dolphin says it's a fair trade
715240	720120	They get viva pinata and they get wiimote but that's not I mean to say Microsoft is getting the wiimote
720120	727400	That's that's a little bit jumping to conclusions because I think it's this is a very minor thing and it's not like XNA games
727400	733240	I don't think we've seen anything made in XNA actually go to the marketplace yet unless that what about that?
733240	738280	What was it a Aegis wing? Was that an XNA game the one they give out for free? Yeah
738680	742200	So that's like the only one though that I can think of that actually is coming
742200	748520	It's just that's the first one, but I don't think you're gonna just like see suddenly a random game that requires wiimotes
749400	753240	For the exact reason the Loki brought up before it's only really gonna work on the PC
754120	757880	It's just kind of interesting. I mean, there's really no other word for it that I can think of
757880	760520	It's just interesting that these worlds are colliding like this
761720	763720	So go figure
763960	769640	Let's see also interesting is a release that's coming out in Japan. It's getting Japan
769640	775480	All prepped for halo 3 because of course halo 3, you know, it's gonna be a big deal in this country, but in Japan
776680	779480	You know, I haven't taught the Amazon list at one point
779480	783880	I think I think it's I think it is doing pretty well in Japan. It's doing it's doing well over there
783880	787640	But it's not quite I mean, it's not quite the phenomenon that it is over here. You know what I mean?
787640	790600	Like, you know, we'll get in some other stuff regarding halo 3 later
790600	791960	That's kind of weird
791960	797320	But we should say this that what is coming out in Japan for roughly the equivalent of 25 years
797320	803640	US is a history pack. It's the halo history pack. It's halo and halo 2
804200	807080	And they're releasing obviously these were xbox games
807640	813960	But they are gonna release them in Japan, I guess with discs that have built-in backwards compatibility updates on them. So
814680	817320	You can just can pop them in the xbox 360s in Japan
817480	821880	And I guess the thought is that maybe this will you know get some hype going for halo 3 so
821880	826920	Kind of interesting that this is coming out but pretty cool a really a really good deal
827080	832040	I think the games are more expensive over here still I think halo 3 still set you back or halo 2
832280	837480	Still set you back at least 30 bucks or at least 20 bucks each. I think at least so not a bad deal
837480	843000	It's still a good deal. I wouldn't be surprised if we see something like that over here. I don't know why they wouldn't but whatever
844920	848760	What is very weird by the way, they can all hear you eating on the stream right now
848760	853240	Very professional. All right. Well, I'm not eating right now. So, huh. I'm done eating
854920	857320	Anywho there's gonna be
858840	864760	Halo 3 pre-orders are like everywhere including 7-eleven now. Yes, you can go buy a
865800	867800	Slurpee or I guess a a
869240	873160	You know simpson themed item and you can also pre-order halo 3
873160	879320	Why well where there's money to be made. I mean you don't think of 7-eleven as being a big
879880	885000	Video game sales chain, but let's face it. I mean lots of people want to buy halo 3
885480	890680	Not everybody's gonna want to deal with the crowds at Best Buy or GameStop or whatever. So why not 7-eleven?
891000	896200	I mean why if they can turn a profit from bringing a small amount of video games into their store? Why not? Right?
897000	899000	I guess
899000	903240	It's just weird because you don't usually think of 7-eleven as a place to go get your games
903240	907240	But honestly if that's a nationwide thing is having confirmed to be nationwide. What's going on?
907240	909240	I don't know franchise to franchise
909880	915480	I would think probably franchise the franchise but um, they did that around here. I might seriously consider it
915480	920520	I mean who else is gonna pre-order it freaking I always thought 7-eleven is a place to go play street fighter 2
921000	926040	DJ dark knight says they sold halo 2 at 7-eleven 2 apparently a lot of people are
926040	930040	Forgetting about that
930040	936040	Bandit says the weekend again all these comments coming from our live chat room chat dot orange launch rate calm
936040	940040	Bandit says the week halo 3 comes out so many 7-elevens are gonna get robbed
940040	942040	so many of them
942040	946040	And JV Mon says didn't 7-eleven have the Wii price and a contest ad once
946040	950040	Sorta, but that was a contest contests are different. I would think hmm
950040	956040	Um, alex selvara says since they turned 7-elevens into quickie marts, maybe turn a few into pillars of autumn
956040	960040	There you go. Turn them into some halo themed stores there. That could be a interesting and expensive
960040	966040	Very expensive and ridiculous. Yeah, it would be a little bit ridiculous. Where the hell am I?
966040	970040	Uh, there's a brand new xbox 360 repair website
970040	976040	If you had your on over in your browser in internet explorer or firefox to service dot xbox
976040	982040	dot com. There's a brand new site just set up pretty much to deal with the red rings of death and other things
982040	984040	Related to xbox 360 failures
984040	988040	It's all automated now and it's probably to reduce the stress on those poor call center reps
988040	990040	I have to take all your angry calls
990040	996040	You can register your console on the site schedule the repairs and keep track of them all through the website and the site
996040	1002040	Will also give you a five dollar discount just in case your xbox 360 is outside of warranty
1002040	1008040	Like if it's not related to the red rings of death or whatever, um, since i'm sure that's money that's being saved
1008040	1012040	On the customer service end from not having to actually talk to you
1014040	1020040	Whoo five dollar discount off of like 150 bucks to repair that thing. That's a little ridiculous
1022040	1026040	This is extremely sad news for me
1026040	1032040	Um, grand theft auto 4 has been delayed to next year
1032040	1038040	I I cannot tell you the utter disappointment that i've had. Um
1038040	1044040	I know at work all of our grand theft auto group very disappointed
1044040	1048040	But I guess the reason was just wasn't done yet
1048040	1052040	Big game want to make sure it's you know, perfect
1052040	1058040	And they just can't get done. So, you know, but uh outside of you the general consensus
1058040	1062040	I'm feeling from the internet blogs and the internet websites is it's okay
1062040	1068040	Now we have more time to play the other games that are all coming out this holiday season as well. Like it's more halo time
1068040	1074040	It's more mass effect time. It's more, you know, whatever the hell you're playing netroid prime, whatever
1074040	1076040	Now if you gotta look at this very interesting though
1076040	1082040	I mean this actually I think hurts sony because if you look at it sony for you know
1082040	1088040	First party titles and stuff coming out in the fall. They had like heavenly sword lair
1088040	1092040	um ratchet and clank future and
1092040	1098040	You know, I guess sing star or not. I have judgment. I mean those aren't I mean heavenly sword
1098040	1102040	It's gonna be awesome and lair is gonna be pretty awesome and then ratchet and clank
1102040	1108040	You know, definitely a good game, but those don't sell systems grand theft auto 4 would sell systems
1108040	1112040	And I know it's ridiculous because yeah, it's coming out in the 360 as well
1112040	1118040	But still, you know, some people are sony loyalists and they will buy their system when there really is something about that
1118040	1124040	PlayStation name that is going to keep a lot of people with playstation, but here's the thing now that it's not coming out
1124040	1126040	People are going to start thinking hey
1126040	1132040	You know, I just can't wait anymore and you know now you've got halo 3 coming out
1132040	1138040	It's gonna sell even more now that there's nothing competing with it, you know, at least around that same time and you know
1138040	1144040	Plus microsoft has a really strong lineup for the fall. I mean shit that's gonna really hurt them
1144040	1150040	I mean granted the game is gonna still sell like crazy when it comes out because now there's gonna be nothing competing with it
1150040	1152040	but
1152040	1158040	That's still more time and less units out there for sony and that's also more opportunity for them to lose
1158040	1161040	Even more exclusives if they can't have a good holiday season
1161040	1168040	What about the rumors that it's the the part of the reason of the delay is the playstation 3 development and that it's coding problems
1168040	1172040	Um, somebody just brought that up in chat and also I remember reading that somewhere, but I don't know
1172040	1176040	There's there's part of me that felt that that was a little bit fanboy ish. Like I didn't know whether to pump it or not
1176040	1177040	I don't know if it's true or not
1177040	1183040	I mean I could see it because there are a lot of games lately from all different publishers and all different developers
1183040	1188040	That have been delayed on the playstation 3 end because it is hard to develop for they're not used to it
1188040	1193040	They're used to developing for the 360 and you know, just developing for the cell is a lot harder
1193040	1199040	So it's possible. I don't think it's true, but I just think the game was just not done
1199040	1202040	It was a pretty aggressive deadline there
1202040	1208040	They're trying to meet and you know, they probably just want to make sure it's perfect because the game is gonna be open to a crap load of scrutiny, right?
1208040	1209040	Hell yeah
1209040	1211040	So especially from our very own Loki
1211040	1212040	Hell yeah
1212040	1216040	All right. Well, you know, that's not the only game to get delayed
1216040	1219040	I know probably not quite as many of you were looking forward to this
1219040	1225040	Opened up to say that black site area 51, of course area 51 being one of their popular shooting games
1225040	1228040	Well, this new area 51 is going to be a very popular game
1228040	1234040	On PC PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 it has been bumped back to November 5th
1234040	1236040	Which isn't a huge delay
1236040	1241040	I mean, it's not like what we're looking at for the other games there, but it has been bumped back to November
1241040	1245040	And funny enough, there's no demo for the PlayStation 3 yet on their service
1245040	1248040	I think there was one supposed to be coming out later this month
1248040	1251040	Possibly development issues
1251040	1254040	And this there's another thing also too
1254040	1258040	That we're forgetting about and I'm going to cover this right now
1258040	1264040	There's another game delayed lair which is supposed to be coming out actually next week is now coming out in September 4th
1264040	1269040	And the reason why it's being delayed is to enhance community features in the game
1269040	1275040	Because if you remember lair is gonna be one of the first games that supports home in both the I guess their trophy system
1275040	1281040	As well as you know being able to launch the game from home and stuff like that
1281040	1289040	So some of these games also coming out in the fall may be delayed with some of those features in mind as well
1289040	1294040	Interesting, so I mean that doesn't seem like that huge of a delay though
1294040	1297040	I mean is that really enough time to kind of fix everything?
1297040	1299040	I guess it is
1299040	1301040	Strange
1301040	1305040	Alright well we're going to get into the mailbag, we can't delay that anymore
1305040	1308040	It's been two weeks coming and we want to get to your emails
1308040	1312040	And hear from some of you folks and unfortunately dark soccer is not here tonight
1312040	1314040	But filling in tonight for the mailbag is the one and only Miklotov
1314040	1319040	Me
1319040	1322040	So unfortunately we don't have the music tonight so I'll say
1322040	1326040	I don't know how it goes which one is the mailbag
1328040	1330040	Oh yeah we're used to seeing the song off scene
1330040	1334040	Alright whatever get into the mailbag, who emailed us this week?
1334040	1339680	Well, the first one is from Richard, I'm not going to say his last name because that might
1339680	1340940	be inappropriate.
1340940	1342940	You could use the last initial, I think that's okay, alright, thank you.
1342940	1348940	M, the letter M, says, hey guys, I just felt like saying hi because you guys are so cool.
1348940	1352340	It was a real bummer you didn't have a show last week.
1352340	1354140	It feels like it's been longer though.
1354140	1358780	Also, I just found my Golden Sun game and was wondering did you ever like playing it
1358780	1363500	because it seriously, to me, lacks the information giving, meaning it doesn't always let me
1363500	1365780	know where I need to go or do.
1365780	1369880	And is the new Tales of game for PSP any good?
1369880	1372000	And I already said who it was by, so I'm not going to say it again.
1372000	1374540	And he needs to learn how to use commas because he used them incorrectly.
1374540	1377540	Oh my god, it's just like having Jamie here.
1377540	1380860	Shane's complaining about the grammar of the emails, this is amazing.
1380860	1381860	I'm sorry.
1381860	1383620	I honestly don't know a lot, I mean, Golden Sun.
1383620	1385380	I played the crap out of Golden Sun, actually.
1385380	1387300	Well, then you answer that.
1387300	1391920	I loved it up until like, I put it down for two days and he's dead on where it doesn't
1391920	1394180	tell you what you're supposed to do, ever.
1394180	1397580	So putting it down for two days meant I couldn't play it anymore because I forgot what I was
1397580	1401420	doing and there was nothing to help me figure out what I was doing, except for the internet.
1401420	1404980	And I don't think I really used the internet much at that time when it came out.
1404980	1408780	But yeah, it's a great game if you remember what you're doing or keep track of it.
1408780	1410900	I don't know anything about Tales game.
1410900	1413820	Loki, do you know anything about Tales game?
1413820	1419460	There was a Tales game, got it.
1419460	1421260	There's a new Tales game I know coming out.
1421260	1423740	I haven't heard too much about it, though.
1423740	1427820	I will try to read up on it very quickly while you read the next email.
1427820	1428820	Look how long this is.
1428820	1429820	Do I have to read it all?
1429820	1430820	Yeah, just read it.
1430820	1431820	Okay.
1431820	1435780	This is from Scott L. Wait, crap, he has like a pseudonym at the bottom.
1435780	1436860	Maybe I'll just wait till that.
1436860	1439180	That's not from Scott L. at all.
1439180	1440740	Okay.
1440740	1441740	This is what it says.
1441740	1444500	I'm bad at this, my god.
1444500	1451180	Hey Yet Again, guys, was listening to this week's Part B and had a couple of responses.
1451180	1456220	Number one, I had a 360 break on me with the disk scratching problem.
1456220	1460900	This was one day after I bought it and had originally set it up on my coffee table while
1460900	1463940	I made sure I had everything set up correctly.
1463940	1468840	Once it was running smoothly, I gently picked it up to move it onto my entertainment center
1468840	1472980	and next thing I knew, I heard a horrible loud grinding sound.
1472980	1478680	I had only lifted it about an inch off the table and it, god, there's so much to read,
1478680	1481340	but I had lifted it gently without tilting it at all.
1481340	1486900	It not only ruined my disk, but when I put another disk in, and I don't want to read
1486900	1489300	this anymore, this is really long and boring.
1489300	1495140	Okay, the gist of what he's saying is it scratched that disk as well once he put another one
1495140	1497380	in to test it.
1497380	1501580	And he learns his error of his ways because- Exactly.
1501580	1505640	Don't move the system while it's on.
1505640	1509960	He says it was near the system's launch and he had no idea it would happen.
1509960	1515500	He has had lots of machines that use his disks from PS1 on, as well as PCs, and I've never
1515500	1517940	had this happen before when I moved them.
1517940	1522540	He got a replacement and things have been smooth sailing at first, but he wanted to
1522540	1528060	let everyone know that the disk scratching problem is a blatant fault in the 360 hardware
1528060	1530660	and can happen without, or with the slightest movement.
1530660	1534920	It doesn't require shaking or tilting it, even though it sounds like, you know, any
1534920	1539060	sort of jostling, just picking it up is enough to break it.
1539060	1543820	And the second thing he says is, you said Microsoft didn't make or license their titles
1543820	1544820	to DS.
1544820	1546220	Oh, we talked about this earlier.
1546220	1548100	Yeah, did he bring up the same mech assault?
1548100	1550180	Mech assault and Age of Empires.
1550180	1554900	The chatter beat you to it just because the chat room comment came before the mailbag,
1554900	1555900	sorry.
1555900	1558260	Yeah, and then he talks about Halo.
1558260	1560260	It's very boring.
1560260	1562620	Cheers, y'all!
1562620	1563620	Hero antagonist.
1563620	1565860	You're the worst email reader ever.
1565860	1567700	Did you see how long this is, though?
1567700	1569740	It just kept going on and on.
1569740	1570940	Yeah, then summarize.
1570940	1571940	I did.
1571940	1572940	I tried.
1572940	1577040	All right, really quickly, the chat room has some comments here about the, where we did
1577040	1580060	not know much about the Tales of series, our chat room fills in here.
1580060	1581060	Hooray.
1581060	1585980	Alex Silvera says, Tales of the world, Radiant mythology for the PSP, simply, it's awesome.
1585980	1587180	Oh, that's right.
1587180	1588280	That's the game that came out.
1588280	1592260	And Zappy says, the PSP Tales of is a fan service for Tales of fan.
1592260	1595060	There you go.
1595060	1596060	Hooray.
1596060	1599620	Next, email is from Rissimo.
1599620	1605740	It says, hey guys, oh, by the way, I have to censor this because I don't cuss, so this
1605740	1606740	should be interesting.
1606740	1610780	Hey, guys, I've been a faithful listener for about a year and a half now.
1610780	1615940	I've been in the chat room a few times, but I'm often too busy to listen to you live,
1615940	1618340	so I just download the podcast to my PSP.
1618340	1623020	I think the three of you offer so much to the gaming community and find it sad that
1623020	1627700	many gamers that listen to podcasts haven't heard of you.
1627700	1628700	The end.
1628700	1629700	Stop it.
1629700	1631020	Come on, keep going.
1631020	1635900	I love the extreme sarcasm and angst that Jamie has, or that Jamie offers.
1635900	1641500	Matt's rants are incredibly entertaining, and Rob is just too fracking adorable.
1641500	1642940	I know you're moving.
1642940	1643940	The word was fucking?
1643940	1644940	Yes.
1644940	1645940	Was that the word, Shane?
1645940	1646940	That's one word.
1646940	1647940	There's more.
1647940	1649700	Hey, I'm adorable.
1649700	1650700	That's great.
1650700	1656220	I know you're moving the studio soon and just want to know about any possible changes.
1656220	1658420	I really hope you guys add video.
1658420	1659420	Please consider it.
1659420	1662060	Loki, I agree with you on the zapper.
1662060	1665180	Just try to homosexual your anger a little.
1665180	1667740	I don't even know what that means.
1667740	1671540	It's the fag your anger joke from like four weeks ago, of which we are noticing more and
1671540	1675820	more iTunes reviews popping up saying that we need to learn how to fag our anger.
1675820	1676820	That's stupid.
1676820	1677820	You're stupid.
1677820	1680460	Thanks for the oral pleasure, Rissimo.
1680460	1683100	Hey, any time.
1683100	1685300	There was no question in that one.
1685300	1686300	Next.
1686300	1688660	Hey, I don't mind a little ego email now and then.
1688660	1690340	We're on the last email, everybody.
1690340	1691340	Thank God.
1691340	1693900	This one I read earlier, and I think it's interesting, and I'm probably going to do
1693900	1694900	it at some point.
1694900	1695900	All right.
1695900	1699900	Hey, O-L-R. I know I'm a bit late, but it's been a hectic week.
1699900	1704260	I just listened to the post E3 episode and wanted to make a short comment to the listener
1704260	1706860	who was looking for more games for the blind.
1706860	1710180	I recently heard of a game called Sound Voyager for the GBA.
1710180	1713980	Unfortunately, it's an import only from Japan, but since it's handheld, it's region-free.
1713980	1719220	Anyway, I've not played the game, but according to reviews, it's supposedly more enjoyable
1719220	1721580	to play this game with your eyes closed.
1721580	1725940	If you or anyone else is interested, now is a good time to pick it up from Playasia because
1725940	1728180	it's on sale for $15.
1728180	1729980	Those are all the bit generation games.
1729980	1731980	I bought one of them, which I didn't like that one.
1731980	1732980	Sound Voyager?
1732980	1733980	No, it wasn't Sound Voyager.
1733980	1735500	But, I mean, that's one of them.
1735500	1736500	They had one.
1736500	1737500	Yeah, that's one of them.
1737500	1743060	It's generation two, I think, but they're awesome games for the Game Boy Advance.
1743060	1744660	Just be careful.
1744660	1747420	There's one I got colorists or whatever that's not very fun.
1747420	1749020	I didn't really know how to play it.
1749020	1751220	It ends with hope this helps some people out.
1751220	1752220	Apollo.
1752220	1753220	Hooray.
1753220	1755260	That was a good email.
1755260	1756260	That was.
1756260	1757260	It's on a hat.
1757260	1758260	It's helping listeners.
1758260	1759260	Yeah.
1759260	1762900	Unlike the one that was just complimenting you or the guy that writes too much.
1762900	1764140	You're rude.
1764140	1765140	All right.
1765140	1768140	If you want to send an email, we promised Jamie you'll be back next week.
1768140	1770580	She's just as mean as I am.
1770580	1771580	Mailbag at Orange Laundry.
1771580	1773220	Maybe we're going to have Loki read him.
1773220	1774220	He's a little nicer.
1774220	1776140	Who can we get in here that's nice to the listeners?
1776140	1777340	I'm nice.
1777340	1781340	Not when you have to write a whole crap about stuff that's not interesting.
1781340	1784900	Mailbag at OrangeLaundryDo.com.
1784900	1788220	And now it looks like a homosexual your anger might be the new catch line.
1788220	1790100	I started something worse.
1790100	1792780	I'm looking like what?
1792780	1794900	Even what you had before.
1794900	1798700	I don't understand how the last one makes sense, what you guys said, but I don't understand
1798700	1800300	how this one makes even more sense.
1800300	1801300	It was okay.
1801300	1805460	It was that week that we speculated.
1805460	1807600	We didn't know that the word was spastic.
1807600	1811080	Some video game had the word spastic in it, and we speculated that the word was retarded
1811080	1814060	because we didn't realize the cultural differences.
1814060	1817460	So we were talking about the word retard and how it might not mean the same thing in Europe
1817460	1822180	that it means here or whatever, and Loki said retard your anger because I guess it was a
1822180	1824580	line in anger management or whatever.
1824580	1826740	It's also like fire retardant, you know?
1826740	1827740	Oh, okay.
1827740	1831500	So then I was talking about how fag means something different here in America versus
1831500	1832820	what it means in Europe, right?
1832820	1834980	It's not quite the insult it is over there.
1834980	1839500	So then Irene pops up and goes, hey, Loki, you need to fag your anger.
1839500	1840500	And then it caught on.
1840500	1841500	I don't know.
1841500	1843100	That's terrible still.
1843100	1845220	Didn't get any better hearing the story behind it.
1845220	1846220	Sorry.
1846220	1847220	It's okay.
1847220	1848220	Just go.
1848220	1850920	You know what's even worse is when like you talk on the live internet show about something
1850920	1854540	that happened on the same live internet show, like just like five weeks ago, it wasn't even
1854540	1855540	that long ago.
1855540	1858740	It's probably still up for download.
1858740	1859740	Don't give me that look.
1859740	1860740	I'm going to talk.
1860740	1861740	You're giving me that look.
1861740	1865140	I'm looking at the internet.
1865140	1866940	That Laura Roslin look of disapproval.
1866940	1867940	I don't like it.
1867940	1868940	I love Laura Roslin.
1868940	1871420	I wanted to give her a hug at Comic-Con, but she was too far away.
1871420	1872420	All right.
1872420	1875220	Can we talk about something else, including sports games?
1875220	1878500	We don't talk a whole lot about sports games here on the program, and we've gotten some
1878500	1882420	feedback that says maybe we ought to talk a little more about sports games.
1882420	1884380	Maybe if they were interesting, we would.
1884380	1887740	Remember that whole you're an asshole thing we were talking about earlier?
1887740	1889380	I like winning 11.
1889380	1890380	There we go.
1890380	1891380	Well, there you go.
1891380	1894940	Do you like a major league baseball power pros?
1894940	1897100	Oh, the Konami game.
1897100	1898900	Well, it's Konami and 2K sports.
1898900	1899900	That's what makes this interesting.
1899900	1901900	The two of them are actually teaming up to put out the game.
1901900	1903380	Oh, what system is it for?
1903380	1907860	It is coming out for... That's a very good question.
1907860	1908860	I haven't gotten there yet.
1908860	1909860	Gosh.
1909860	1910860	Nintendo Wii and some PlayStation 2.
1910860	1911860	Yeah.
1911860	1912860	I totally saw that in the office.
1912860	1913860	It looked awesome.
1913860	1915980	Are you even allowed to tell us that?
1915980	1917260	What office is left?
1917260	1918260	Oh, okay.
1918260	1920260	I think it's out in the camera.
1920260	1921260	Seriously.
1921260	1922260	Can you tell us more?
1922260	1927380	It was adorable because everybody had big heads and big eyes.
1927380	1928380	It was pretty cool.
1928380	1929380	I don't know.
1929380	1930380	I just saw people playing it.
1930380	1931380	It looked like fun.
1931380	1934600	Well, the press release boasts that there's a dozen different game modes in the game.
1934600	1936100	It's going to have long-term playability.
1936100	1939500	It'll have, of course, a season mode as most sports games do.
1939500	1941000	Success mode as well.
1941000	1944720	In season mode, you become a major league baseball team general manager and, of course,
1944720	1945780	what is the ultimate goal?
1945780	1947660	To win the World Series.
1947660	1951460	Success mode, though, has more traditional role-playing elements and other baseball scenarios
1951460	1952460	in it.
1952460	1956220	They're calling this mode unique and compelling, which, of course, press releases are supposed
1956220	1957220	to talk about.
1957220	1959860	I don't think it's either of those, but it did look like a lot of fun, so I would highly
1959860	1961620	recommend it if you like baseball games.
1961620	1963460	That's what it's really about.
1963460	1964460	To some people.
1964460	1966740	It's not going to be the graphics, that's for sure.
1966740	1971340	See, and now there's people in chat going, no, don't talk about sports games, or Ravensdorf
1971340	1974860	says Sky Talking Baseball makes me want to go kill myself.
1974860	1976220	I love going to baseball games.
1976220	1978420	I'm just saying the games are kind of boring as of late.
1978420	1980580	It's cheapy and cute.
1980580	1982120	Even I love baseball stars on the end.
1982120	1983420	There's the occasional sports game that I will.
1983420	1985480	Like the Ken Griffey games were really fun on the Super Nintendo.
1985480	1986620	Or like Double Dribble.
1986620	1987980	How can you not love NBA Jam?
1987980	1988980	Hello.
1988980	1992420	Yeah, but just because you don't play Madden doesn't mean you have to hate all sports games.
1992420	1993420	Yeah, that's true.
1993420	1996300	Madden is just a little hardcore for maybe some people that don't follow football.
1996300	1997300	Yeah.
1997300	1998300	Maybe it's a bit much.
1998300	2000260	Football is fun to watch, but I don't understand it.
2000260	2002860	If you play racing games, that's a sport.
2002860	2003860	Hello.
2003860	2005660	They tried to make DDR sport, guys.
2005660	2006660	Come on.
2006660	2008820	Well, that's a whole other, you know.
2008820	2010540	But no, sports games can be good.
2010540	2014620	And this one, you know, if you like baseball and you don't mind, you know, cute little
2014620	2016620	things, it's going to be good.
2016620	2017620	Yeah.
2017620	2018620	Okay.
2018620	2019980	Well, one thing that may be good.
2019980	2028020	If you're holding out for All Pro Football 2K8, apparently sales of All Pro Football
2028020	2033100	2K8 were okay, I guess.
2033100	2039620	I guess 2K was not terribly pleased and not terribly disappointed.
2039620	2045340	So the rumor is that it may be dropping price with the upcoming Madden release.
2045340	2050260	So if it's going to drop price, that would probably be by next week then since, well,
2050260	2051740	that's when Madden comes out.
2051740	2053220	So I don't know.
2053220	2054220	Looks pretty cool.
2054220	2058580	I did see some funny videos, though, online of OJ Simpson.
2058580	2063060	And there was this one team, I can't remember what it was, but they had a, one of their
2063060	2068420	mascots was this guy with a knife and he was stabbing.
2068420	2069420	It was funny.
2069420	2074060	So the fun things you can do with All Pro Football.
2074060	2080820	The OL Army Ninja in chat says, you guess a lot, Loki.
2080820	2082060	I do.
2082060	2084660	And I am right a lot as well.
2084660	2090420	Now, okay, even if you, I know some of you guys may not care about the sports games,
2090420	2092420	but I know you guys are ready for this.
2092420	2094540	Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
2094540	2098180	And Super Smash Brothers Brawl, of course, we know it's going to have, you know, huge
2098180	2100020	multiplayer modes, battles.
2100020	2103820	But single player mode, we got a little more information about this week.
2103820	2107580	Personally the single player mode is going to be a bit more of a side scrolling action
2107580	2108580	game.
2108580	2112500	Now if you think back to Super Smash Brothers Melee, the single player was like awesome.
2112500	2116540	Like you know, when you were playing some of those levels, like the first one that looked
2116540	2118420	like the Mario Brothers level or whatever.
2118420	2121780	Like I know a lot of people that were going, where is this game for the GameCube?
2121780	2124680	Where is our Mario Brothers game that looks like this on the GameCube?
2124680	2127500	And so I guess in Brawl they've taken it in another direction.
2127500	2129700	Now it's like this whole side scrolling action game.
2129700	2133060	And some people are comparing it to Kingdom Hearts, just because of the fact that you
2133060	2136620	pull in all these characters from different universes, throw them in a blender and toss
2136620	2138740	them into this one game.
2138740	2142180	Here's a quote from the story, quote, we've managed to create a complete side scrolling
2142180	2143260	action game.
2143260	2147100	Its storyline isn't overwrought, it's hastened along by a bunch of quick movies.
2147100	2149900	The adventure mode also empathizes character development.
2149900	2153660	You'll see many famous characters persevering under the weight of their personal histories,
2153660	2156020	shouldering their unique burdens.
2156020	2159180	It's really something you won't see anywhere else.
2159180	2163400	That sounds kind of cool because it sounds like it could be something that's all by itself.
2163400	2165180	Go figure.
2165180	2167540	Something else I want to say really quickly though, because I noticed it didn't make the
2167540	2168820	show roll.
2168820	2172340	There's some other information that hit the Smash Brothers dojo this week at SmashBrothers.com
2172340	2174140	and that is another newcomer.
2174140	2175460	It's Ike.
2175460	2179580	And Ike you may have never heard of before, unless you play Fire Emblem, because Ike comes
2179580	2180860	from the Fire Emblem series.
2180860	2185260	He comes from I think the GameCube one, which probably sold about five copies.
2185260	2190220	Well, whatever you feel about Fire Emblem, Ike is going to be one of the characters in
2190220	2191220	the game.
2191220	2193380	It's just like a character you'd have a crush on, Miklotov, actually.
2193380	2196180	I totally do, because he's got blue hair.
2196180	2199700	Well, hopefully the Wii version is going to sell a little bit more, because they do have
2199700	2201940	the Wii one coming out in November here, so.
2201940	2202940	That's true.
2202940	2205740	Okay, Loki, I have a question for you, because Shane's going to yell at me if I say this.
2205740	2209940	Loki, is his hair blue or purple?
2209940	2212580	From here it looks kind of dark blue.
2212580	2213940	Oh, it looks purple.
2213940	2215140	Your eyes suck.
2215140	2217220	It's purple to me.
2217220	2218220	There's this inside.
2218220	2219220	It's not even a joke.
2219220	2222220	Do we want to explain to the listener?
2222220	2223220	Miklotov can't see purple.
2223220	2225220	It's indigo.
2225220	2227020	I swear his hair is purple.
2227020	2229300	Well, I'll fight you for it.
2229300	2230300	It looks a little purple.
2230300	2231300	It's blue-y purple.
2231300	2235140	Well, I'll tell you what, well, I don't know.
2235140	2240700	Another interesting thing, we've talked about this numerous times before, but the Neo Geo
2240700	2245900	is coming to the Virtual Console, and now it is confirmed on Nintendo's Virtual Console
2245900	2247860	website in Japan.
2247860	2256100	They do show the Neo Geo there, and also have a spot for another console that's yet unnamed.
2256100	2257100	Dreamcast.
2257100	2258100	Commodore 64.
2258100	2259100	Come on, Dreamcast.
2259100	2260100	MSX.
2260100	2262620	Commodore 64, remember that rumor a while back?
2262620	2263620	Yeah.
2263620	2266340	Like, wasn't, isn't there supposed to be like an Impossible Mission remake that was supposed
2266340	2271440	to be one of the first games that's not just a direct port of something old?
2271440	2273060	There's Impossible Mission.
2273060	2278460	I do remember it's supposed to be coming out, and there's also Elevator Action, which is
2278460	2282100	now called Spy Game Elevator Action.
2282100	2283580	You know, I do and I don't want MSX.
2283580	2287220	I mean, that would be great for the Japanese folks, but they're not going to take the time
2287220	2291200	to translate any of those games into English for us over here, but can you imagine actually
2291200	2297700	being able to play Gardic over here in America, the first game in the Guardian Legends series.
2297700	2301520	And if you've listened to this show for any length of time, you know that I have a huge
2301520	2305820	nerdgasm boner for the Guardian Legends on 8-bit systems.
2305820	2307220	It's gross.
2307220	2309920	But it's true.
2309920	2313340	There's no games that you get that super excited about.
2313340	2314340	Silent Hill.
2314340	2315340	See?
2315340	2316340	Pump It Up.
2316340	2317340	That's gross.
2317340	2318340	Whatever.
2318340	2319340	Both of those games are amazing.
2319340	2320340	You did see that there's a new Pump It Up coming again.
2320340	2321340	It was.
2321340	2322340	PSP.
2322340	2325820	I actually was talking to Rob about that today, and I wanted to cry.
2325820	2328640	And I was making fun of him, because the game will probably have his favorite Pump song
2328640	2329640	of all time in it.
2329640	2332120	It probably will, and it's really going to make me sad.
2332120	2333120	Which for the record is Luzenka.
2333120	2334120	Yes.
2334120	2335120	Save Us.
2335120	2336120	Luzenka, Save Us.
2336120	2337120	I don't know if you like any of these songs.
2337120	2339860	I mean, maybe Guitar Hero 3 will make you feel better, Miklotov.
2339860	2341980	There is one song on there that does make me feel better.
2341980	2343620	Oh, I'm curious to know what it is.
2343620	2349700	There are some new songs that were just announced, and of course, it seems like whenever there's
2349700	2353480	a new Guitar Heroes game, whether it's the 80s edition or the 3, it seems like the songs
2353480	2358340	keep slowly rolling out to keep this game in the press.
2358340	2361700	I will tell you no or yes when you read off the list.
2361700	2362700	Miss Murder by A.I.
2362700	2363700	No.
2363700	2364700	Threes and Sevens by Queen in Stone Age.
2364700	2365700	No.
2365700	2366700	Raining Blood by Stare.
2366700	2367700	No.
2367700	2368700	Reptilia by The Strokes.
2368700	2369700	No.
2369700	2370700	Paranoid by Black Sabbath.
2370700	2371700	No.
2371700	2372700	Cities on Flame by Blue Ice or Cold.
2372700	2373700	No.
2373700	2374700	Mississippi Queen by Mountain.
2374700	2375700	No.
2375700	2376700	You didn't read enough of it.
2376700	2377700	That's it.
2377700	2378700	That's the seven new songs.
2378700	2382820	That video was crazy.
2382820	2383820	Through the Fire and Flames.
2383820	2384820	Yes.
2384820	2385820	Oh, my God.
2385820	2387660	I don't know why.
2387660	2393700	It does remind me stuff you'd see in Guitar Freaks and stuff, just the insanely fast...
2393700	2395460	Made no sense, really.
2395460	2397820	It's just like, oh, my God.
2397820	2399820	I like Cherub Rock by the Smashing Pumpkins.
2399820	2400900	That looks like it would be cool.
2400900	2402380	Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones.
2402380	2403380	That's kind of awesome.
2403380	2404380	If they did Muzzle by...
2404380	2405380	Sabotage by Beastie Boys.
2405380	2406380	Hey, this is my bad.
2406380	2407380	I don't like the Beastie Boys.
2407380	2408380	Tenacious D songs in there.
2408380	2409860	My Name is Jonas by Weezer.
2409860	2412540	I'm still thinking that Rock Band's going to outdo this.
2412540	2416100	From everything I understand, I'll probably buy them both because I'm such a whore for
2416100	2417100	music games.
2417100	2418100	I can admit it.
2418100	2419100	I don't know.
2419100	2421260	Have you seen footage of Guitar Hero 3 since Neversoft took it over?
2421260	2422260	Yeah.
2422260	2423260	It looks kind of weird.
2423260	2424260	That's all right.
2424260	2426860	DDR looked kind of weird when it went over to the Xbox, but you get used to it.
2426860	2430860	Still kind of looks weird.
2430860	2433940	I like how you can give us a more honest opinion now.
2433940	2436100	I don't think I ever was not honest about how I felt about the game.
2436100	2437540	I guess that's true, but it seems different now.
2437540	2439980	What do you think about DDR Hottest Party?
2439980	2443180	I think it's a piece of crap.
2443180	2446580	Oh, man.
2446580	2450080	I'm way too honest.
2450080	2452300	We probably ought to move on to the next topic.
2452300	2453300	Loki.
2453300	2459380	Yeah, speaking of weird and kind of crappy, Guitar Hero.
2459380	2466300	It's been spotted in the arcade, and it's actually, they had a wonderful shot of it
2466300	2467860	on Kotaku.
2467860	2474260	It was a game in a Bangkok arcade, and what's funny about it is there's no guitar.
2474260	2475260	It's just Guitar Hero.
2475260	2479100	Why are you giggling at him talking about a game in Bangkok if you don't have a perverted
2479100	2480100	mind, Shane?
2480100	2481100	No, I'm not laughing at that.
2481100	2482140	I'll tell you later.
2482140	2484320	Go on with your story.
2484320	2487780	What's funny, though, is the whole game looks like popin' music.
2487780	2493540	It's got basically giant buttons for each of the fret buttons, and I guess you play
2493540	2498060	it a little bit like popin' music.
2498060	2504460	One might say, though, it's kind of ripping off of Beatmania, so that's kind of ironic.
2504460	2508420	So all you do is you just hit the buttons down, and that's like an automatic strumming,
2508420	2509420	too?
2509420	2510780	I don't know, but...
2510780	2511780	It would just be popin' music.
2511780	2512780	That's all it is.
2512780	2514420	I was just saying, it's popin' music.
2514420	2515420	Poppin' Hero.
2515420	2518340	That's a terrible name.
2518340	2520500	It sounds like a popcorn game.
2520500	2523140	By the way, I just want to point out, this is what Shane's doing during the show.
2523140	2525100	You know why he started laughing?
2525100	2527280	It had nothing to do with the whole Bangkok thing.
2527280	2531180	He's reading Big Brother 8 live updates and giggling at them, and the housemates calling
2531180	2533140	each other dirty names.
2533140	2535580	That's what really goes on here in the OLR studio.
2535580	2536580	Whatever.
2536580	2537580	Hey, don't get off topic.
2537580	2539420	Continue with your video games discussion.
2539420	2541380	Oh, okay, I will.
2541380	2543740	So would you play Guitar Hero in the arcade if it was popin' music?
2543740	2547500	I may try it once just to say that I played it, and that's about it.
2547500	2548500	I like popin' in the arcade.
2548500	2549500	It would be fun.
2549500	2550500	It would be cool.
2550500	2555580	I'm sure it's like playing Unjamma Lamy in the arcade, which I played one time.
2555580	2557580	It was very strange.
2557580	2561580	Like first off, it's made for little kids, so I had to like get on my knees to play this
2561580	2562580	game.
2562580	2565080	Shut up!
2565080	2570180	But I like, you know, because I'm really tall, unlike little Asian girls, and I had to like,
2570180	2574860	you know, squat down to play the, never mind, I'm not going to finish the story.
2574860	2578780	Was it like trying to use like a little kid urinal or something like that?
2578780	2586340	Like they did in Billy Madison, where he has to like squat down, he falls over.
2586340	2587340	Let's see.
2587340	2591180	Ross Steel UT says, you hit the buttons, isn't that every fucking rhythm game ever?
2591180	2592180	Kinda.
2592180	2595740	Hit them with your feet, hit them with your hands, hit them with the strumming, hit them
2595740	2596740	with your voice.
2596740	2598940	You can't hit buttons with your voice.
2598940	2599940	Sorta.
2599940	2602580	You can if you sing really bad.
2602580	2610020	Some people say my voice pushes people's buttons.
2610020	2611860	I love dead air.
2611860	2617420	Moving on to another story, and this is a story that seems to come up every single week,
2617420	2621860	but there's a website out there, Inner Bits, that is saying that developers have their
2621860	2626860	dirty little hands on a six axis controller that rumbles.
2626860	2630700	And yes, we've been hearing this story on and off, and Loki has been insisting for weeks
2630700	2635540	and weeks that yes, this is coming, but apparently various Sony developers do have their hands
2635540	2637820	on the six axis with rumble.
2637820	2642660	Rumor is it could be their big announcement at the convention in Germany, the Leipzig
2642660	2643660	convention.
2643660	2650520	Congratulations for spending $499 on your brand new 60 gig PlayStation 3 system.
2650520	2654380	Also congratulations, you're now gonna have to buy new controllers, thank you.
2654380	2656060	What's also funny is they actually did come out and-
2656060	2657060	Sure, why not?
2657060	2658060	The same thing happened on PS1 and PS2.
2658060	2659060	Oh yeah.
2659060	2660060	Wait.
2660060	2662940	But they didn't say rumble is last generation then.
2662940	2667700	PS1 didn't have the little analog sticks to be analyzed, and PS2 didn't have rumble to
2667700	2668700	begin with.
2668700	2669700	I have a PS2 controller that doesn't have rumble.
2669700	2670700	Really?
2670700	2671700	Yes.
2671700	2672700	I swear they had-
2672700	2673700	I bought one at launch.
2673700	2674700	It had rumble.
2674700	2676820	Then why the fuck doesn't my PlayStation 2 controller rumble?
2676820	2677820	Is it broken?
2677820	2678820	No.
2678820	2679820	I think it is.
2679820	2680820	Are you sure it's a PlayStation 2 controller?
2680820	2681820	I'm sure.
2681820	2682820	It could be just an-
2682820	2683820	A black PS1 controller?
2683820	2684820	Yeah, they had those.
2684820	2685820	Did they?
2685820	2686820	Son of a bitch.
2686820	2688580	Yeah, because I remember I bought mine at launch and-
2688580	2689580	Yeah, I worked it.
2689580	2690580	Oh my god.
2690580	2691580	I failed.
2691580	2692580	Jesus.
2692580	2698420	I do remember having to buy the DualShock controllers at one time, so yeah, that makes sense.
2698420	2703860	But this is something that they took away and now they're putting back.
2703860	2707860	But they said they justified taking away, because it was a last generation feature.
2707860	2708860	Oh, okay.
2708860	2710420	Because rumble is so last gen.
2710420	2712900	Welcome to last gen, Sony.
2712900	2715980	They're all, well, last gen sold better than this gen, so let's go back.
2715980	2718020	I think that's what they're doing.
2718020	2725020	They're like, maybe if we can just make it like the PS2, it'll sell.
2725020	2730900	Anyways, so another interesting thing, Warhawk is finally, the price point has been announced.
2730900	2735300	We knew before that the retail version was going to be $59.99, and that was going to
2735300	2741020	include a Bluetooth headset, as well as some extra bonus behind the scenes crap.
2741020	2746420	And now the online version, probably the most expensive download I think you'll ever see
2746420	2753700	on a console, well, so far at least, is $39.99 to download this game.
2753700	2755380	You thought Luminous was expensive.
2755380	2761340	Well, actually, if you add it up, if you add up the game itself and then all the fucking
2761340	2764100	little packs they have with it, maybe it's getting close.
2764100	2765660	It's probably about $25.
2765660	2767140	That's before we even get to packs.
2767140	2770820	I mean, what makes you think that Warhawk's not going to have downloadable content?
2770820	2772820	Good point, good point.
2772820	2774780	Alright, so are you going to buy this though?
2774780	2775780	Nope.
2775780	2780980	I have, I do not like online only multiplayer games.
2780980	2781980	That's true.
2781980	2782980	No more MMOs.
2782980	2783980	That's what turned me off to...
2783980	2784980	MMOs are different.
2784980	2789700	This is just like straight, you know, online only multiplayer.
2789700	2791480	It feels like half a game to me.
2791480	2795780	It's like taking the online portion of your single player first person shooter and just,
2795780	2800820	well, we didn't feel like creating this story, so let's just make the game.
2800820	2805060	Okay, the chat room is all like saying, you know, and I appreciate the chat room and their
2805060	2810740	comments, but they're all like, Sky, have you turned on the rumble and the various games?
2810740	2812700	Give me a little credit here, people.
2812700	2817100	I mean, okay, I've been doing an internet radio program about video games with my friends
2817100	2818340	for five years.
2818340	2822360	Okay, give me a little bit of the benefit of the doubt that I know how to turn these
2822360	2826820	features on and games and check and see, you know, all this stuff.
2826820	2830120	I realize I'm not perfect and I don't get things right all the time.
2830120	2832100	We're human, but please.
2832100	2836380	I'm trying to remember if yours even has the little button in the middle to turn on.
2836380	2838500	It does.
2838500	2839500	And we're back, folks.
2839500	2840500	Sorry about that.
2840500	2841500	We don't know what happened.
2841500	2842500	I can tell you what happened.
2842500	2845180	This Skype mess with the settings there.
2845180	2847500	Well, live radio, boys and girls, we're in the temporary studio.
2847500	2848560	What can you do?
2848560	2849560	These things happen.
2849560	2851940	Now, I don't know what the last thing the folks heard was, though, before we went to
2851940	2852940	the Skype line.
2852940	2855180	So quickly give us the last story again real quick there.
2855180	2856180	Sorry, folks.
2856180	2857180	Live radio, things happen.
2857180	2858180	The last story?
2858180	2859180	Like, which story?
2859180	2862380	The story about the start of the read?
2862380	2863380	Okay.
2863380	2868340	So we were going to cover one story that we ran on the website about the Tokyo game show
2868340	2869860	list for Sega.
2869860	2872260	That makes me sad.
2872260	2873860	And that looks really awesome.
2873860	2875660	It's such a wonderful list.
2875660	2878460	Even like, Fighters Megamix 2 and stuff, I was like, oh, hell yeah.
2878460	2880460	New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio.
2880460	2882540	New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio, yeah.
2882540	2883540	Guess what?
2883540	2884540	It's fake.
2884540	2888340	Because it was too much of a Sega fanboy's dream.
2888340	2890060	And we posted that on our website.
2890060	2891060	Yes.
2891060	2892060	Awesome job.
2892060	2893060	Awesome job, everybody.
2893060	2895020	Now, how did it get debunked?
2895020	2899740	The original source actually has posted a retraction and apology.
2899740	2904900	So saying we lied because we made all of those up because people wanted to hear that.
2904900	2907740	Yeah, so they are a big douche, apparently.
2907740	2915660	It says, let's see, it says there has been a lot of controversy regarding the recently
2915660	2919140	posted rumor regarding Sega's possible Tokyo game show lineup.
2919140	2924540	Now, I was originally very defensive of this piece and because of who sent it in, his long
2924540	2932500	time go-to guy named Rob, Rob, what did you do, has sent me exclusive tips of four years
2932500	2937540	and until this most recent one, all were accurate.
2937540	2945020	And apparently, Rob says, sorry guys, says that I'm sorry for this whole damn mess.
2945020	2947660	I assure you that this will not happen again.
2947660	2950660	I have to say I applaud you guys for being right on top of this.
2950660	2952820	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2952820	2956900	I think really some of those games sounded plausible up until you hit Shenmue 3.
2956900	2961820	I can tell you one thing, though, that will be a Tokyo game show this year.
2961820	2967420	I don't know if you can get excited about this or not, but a new Sonic Riders game,
2967420	2969580	Sonic Riders Zero Gravity will be there.
2969580	2973900	It's coming out on the Wii and PlayStation 2, actually around the same time as the first
2973900	2979020	one came out last year, around February, I believe.
2979020	2984500	If it was a new version of Sonic R with the same awesome music, maybe I'd care, but...
2984500	2986140	Yeah, it's just not...
2986140	2991980	Riders was okay, it was an alright game, but, I don't know, put it this way, as long as
2991980	2996900	it controls better than Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3 and 360, I'm fine with that.
2996900	3000140	Ooh, that was, that's a burn right there because that game sucks.
3000140	3004740	Alright, so, I'm very sorry, guys, we're not going to be able to do the Skype line tonight,
3004740	3009620	live radio, and things are broken and it's not running at the same time as our recording
3009620	3013060	software does, so that's okay, we'll bring it back next week.
3013060	3016900	We'll take more calls next week to make up for it, but we will do some Ask Orange Lounge
3016900	3017900	tonight.
3017900	3020460	We do have our chat room is still working, you guys can interact with us through that,
3020460	3025060	so if you have a question for us, send me a private message in the chat room and we'll
3025060	3028900	do some Ask Orange Lounge here in just a moment, I see some questions starting to come in.
3028900	3031140	I like the bubble noises, that was fun.
3031140	3034740	No, I didn't like that, I don't know if the chat, that might have been when our stream
3034740	3037660	died, I don't know if they heard the bubble noises or not.
3037660	3043860	Well, you can probably go in there and adjust it so that it's line in stuff, I don't know,
3043860	3044860	fucking hate Skype.
3044860	3050180	Yeah, I don't know, at this point, let's just, do we really want to break the show further
3050180	3051180	tonight?
3051180	3052180	Yeah!
3052180	3053180	Might as well go all or nothing.
3053180	3055740	Let's go all the way, man, let's break the show.
3055740	3060380	Alright, well there are some comments in chat about the whole Sega thing going on, Ross
3060380	3063980	Deal UT says, Sega doesn't know how to make good games anymore, how could you not know
3063980	3066300	this was fake?
3066300	3068780	They do ruin all their franchises they touch lately.
3068780	3073200	And also, if you looked at that list, that's a huge fucking list, I mean, there's no way
3073200	3074420	they're working on that much.
3074420	3079580	The only thing that was missing from it was Panzer Dragoon Saga 2, that was it.
3079580	3083700	Everything else is like, and boy.
3083700	3090140	Let's see, um, Raven's Dolphin says, no Skype, wow, OLR is having my kind of failure.
3090140	3091260	There you go.
3091260	3094340	Dartitsui has said they should make a new Jet Set Radio for the Wii anyway.
3094340	3096380	Not for the Wii, make it for the 360.
3096380	3098660	Dartitsui says, oh hell, a new Samba de Amigo.
3098660	3099660	Yes.
3099660	3100660	I found my Samba stuff.
3100660	3101660	I know, I saw that, it made me happy.
3101660	3105420	Did you see that they had a Samba de Amigo listed as a PSP title on it?
3105420	3108980	Yeah, what are you going to do, shake your stupid PSP?
3108980	3111100	I'm going to make a game for the PSP.
3111100	3112100	Called Shake?
3112100	3117300	No, no, no, no, no, no, hear me out, and it's going to have a rumble, like, detector, and
3117300	3119100	it's going to be like a baby simulator.
3119100	3121500	I knew it was going to be a Shake the Baby game.
3121500	3126500	I knew when you started talking it was going to be a Shake the Baby game, that's so wrong.
3126500	3127500	I like it.
3127500	3131340	Alright, so we promised we'd do some Ask Orange Lounge, so I'm going to read some questions
3131340	3133860	here from our chatroom, and unfortunately we don't have the theme music unless Shane
3133860	3134860	wants to sing it.
3134860	3135860	Um, what's the theme music?
3135860	3138740	Do the same as the mailbag music, because we're cheap here on this program.
3138740	3140100	Um, no thank you.
3140100	3142780	Alright, let's Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question.
3142780	3143780	Let's start off with this.
3143780	3145940	That's probably a stupid question indeed.
3145940	3151300	Well, it's from Raven's Dolphin, and the question just hearts, just teasing.
3151300	3154660	Raven's Dolphin says, Skye, how come you do not talk about your iBook, because I got a
3154660	3156420	MacBook and like it.
3156420	3159540	I'm playing with it, so he can't talk about it.
3159540	3163500	I like my iBook, I do, you know what, it's the only internet I have right now because
3163500	3167020	that's how I'm able to steal the neighbor's Wi-Fi.
3167020	3168660	The screensaver's really pretty.
3168660	3172020	Well you can choose from several different screensavers, I don't know if you're aware.
3172020	3174420	I think there's much more to the Mac than just the screensaver.
3174420	3175420	Without it.
3175420	3180540	Oh yeah, there's being able to play WoW on it, but very badly, because I can't fly down.
3180540	3184900	For me, who does a lot of work on the road, and who travels a lot, it's great.
3184900	3189740	I love the Mac for that stuff, and it's got a great DVD authoring program on it.
3189740	3191780	I will give it that.
3191780	3192820	Let's go to some more questions.
3192820	3197640	Of course, Ask Orange Lounge tonight in lieu of the Skype line, since we do not have the
3197640	3198860	Skype line tonight.
3198860	3202660	DJ Janai asks, how was moving last week?
3202660	3207100	It was long, and tedious, and I'm very glad to be done with it.
3207100	3211340	And the new house that I live in is so much better than the apartment I was in before,
3211340	3215140	with no disrespect to Extrofer, because living with Extrofer was fun, but just the place
3215140	3217780	itself is so much better now, or in a house.
3217780	3220380	There's actually a backyard and a lawn demo, it's something else.
3220380	3225220	I saw an animal run by in the backyard today, it was really scary, it was loud and thumpy.
3225220	3227020	Cool, what kind of animal was it?
3227020	3229740	Like either a cat or a raccoon or something.
3229740	3230740	Maybe a possum.
3230740	3231740	Yeah, possums.
3231740	3232740	We'll see.
3232740	3237460	DJ Tyrant wants to know, what do you think of any of the announcements at BlizzCon this
3237460	3238460	weekend?
3238460	3239460	Oh my goodness.
3239460	3240460	Let's talk about BlizzCon.
3240460	3245460	DJ Tyrant, listen to part A, buddy, listen to part A and let us know what you think.
3245460	3251020	Going to Alex Silvara, does anyone like the Dynasty Samurai Warriors series besides me?
3251020	3255140	Oh, I did hear there's a new incarnation coming out with that on Xbox 360.
3255140	3258020	Okay, I'm through.
3258020	3261700	They're going to be doing Dynasty Warriors Gundam, that's coming out in August.
3261700	3266260	Then they've got that Warriors Orochi, which is coming out in September, which is pretty
3266260	3270020	much Dynasty Warriors mixed with Samurai Warriors, and to be honest, I couldn't tell
3270020	3272400	the two apart.
3272400	3276920	Now there's Dynasty Warriors 6, which actually looks like they did something with the series
3276920	3284460	and made it look a little bit better on 360, so I don't know.
3284460	3287460	Gameplay-wise, they haven't changed anything, but graphically, it looks like they haven't
3287460	3290660	changed anything either, so I don't know.
3290660	3293420	Not much I could really be excited about.
3293420	3299040	Although there is Samurai Warrior Katana later this year, so.
3299040	3303020	Going over to a question from RossDLUT, here's actually a really good question and something
3303020	3304660	that wasn't brought up earlier in the show.
3304660	3308660	With the recent raids on mod chippers, the internet's pretty much gone nuts.
3308660	3312500	The question I have is, well, are people so selfish that they feel gamers shouldn't
3312500	3314140	have to support game companies?
3314140	3318540	Personally, I'd rather XSeed were able to make profits than have 500 pirates to every
3318540	3321620	one importer.
3321620	3322620	Interesting point.
3322620	3325580	I mean, because there's been, like, those raids going on, apparently, about all these
3325580	3327100	people that will mod chip your systems.
3327100	3330020	I'm very curious to hear what you think about this, Loki.
3330020	3331740	About modding and stuff like that?
3331740	3333460	And all the crackdowns and all that?
3333460	3339660	Well, I mean, what they're doing is violating the law, but, I mean, at the same time, there's
3339660	3344020	ways around things that you don't necessarily have to put a hardware mod chip into it, nor
3344020	3346140	to be able to play stuff from other countries.
3346140	3350580	I think, also, the problem is, like, with a lot of these things, you know, games are
3350580	3355540	expensive now, don't get me wrong, but, at the same time, you know, people are kind of
3355540	3358380	jaded with paying 60 bucks and getting crap.
3358380	3361620	They're getting hosed, and, like, they kind of justify it in a way, well, fuck this.
3361620	3366820	I wasted, you know, 60 bucks on Bomberman Act Zero, and I thought it was going to be
3366820	3371660	a really awesome game, and it's just crap, you know, and now I can't get my money back,
3371660	3375380	so fuck you, I'm going to steal your next game, you know.
3375380	3379660	There's that, and there's also, you know, with importing, I don't understand why more
3379660	3384500	systems are like the PlayStation 3 and the PSP, you know, let people import their games
3384500	3385500	if they want to.
3385500	3389300	Hell, it sells an extra copy for you, you still make some money off of it, and, you
3389300	3392300	know, I don't think it's really hurting anything, okay, it's going to be a Japanese version
3392300	3393700	of the game or something.
3393700	3395580	Big deal, you know.
3395580	3399380	I think in the big scope of things, too, there's so few people that actually import in the
3399380	3402820	big scope of gaming, it's not that big a deal, I don't think.
3402820	3403820	It's not.
3403820	3407420	I mean, hell, that's, how else did Elite Beat Agents get a release here, but from people
3407420	3408420	importing Ohndon?
3408420	3409420	Exactly.
3409420	3414580	And you know what, hey, look, my buying, um, GS68 just said the same damn thing in chat.
3414580	3419060	You know, my buying Wangan Midnight, that sold one extra copy for them, and you know
3419060	3420060	why I bought it?
3420060	3425180	Because there's not a lot of stuff coming out over here, so, what the hell?
3425180	3430180	Um, yeah, you know, but as far as just, like, pirating to get a bunch of games for free,
3430180	3435300	especially when you're downloading things like Halo 3, and Blue Dragon, you know, assumably
3435300	3438780	when these games come out, Blue Dragon, kind of like the stuff, you know, you know it's
3438780	3440780	not going to be like Borrow Man X-Zero, it's a little different.
3440780	3445980	Let me put it this way, okay, yeah, my PSP is modded, yes, I can play games without having
3445980	3449860	to buy them, but, would I have bought those games if it wasn't modded?
3449860	3451300	No, I wouldn't have.
3451300	3454820	I just play games that are from other countries just to check them out.
3454820	3458540	I normally don't end up, you know, buying them, I would have felt bad if I actually
3458540	3459540	bought them because they sucked.
3459540	3460540	So.
3460540	3464060	It's also not like you don't buy video games, I mean, you have a shitload of video games
3464060	3467180	everywhere in this house, so, you buy a lot of video games.
3467180	3471220	I spend a lot of money on video games, and you know what, if I can play something for
3471220	3475900	free instead of paying for it, yeah, I'll do it because it frees up more money for buying
3475900	3478340	something else.
3478340	3483340	Legend of Zaku has this for Ask Orange Lounge, bring back the camera, bringing back the webcam
3483340	3484340	would be hot.
3484340	3487980	It looks like it is going to happen in the new studio, but we're just not sure, I mean,
3487980	3491180	getting a webcam in there isn't a problem, now it's just about delivering it to the site,
3491180	3493420	so we will have more information on that later.
3493420	3498700	Yes, we've seen the suggestions about, I don't know what, Justin TV, Operator 11, whatever
3498700	3503500	site Travis Donovan's using, or Saturday, we're looking into what we want to use, and
3503500	3504500	we'll have more information on that later.
3504500	3511460	I even thought about doing something in here, if we had time, so I buried the Xbox Vision
3511460	3515220	camera because I haven't used it for anything.
3515220	3517720	Something soon, we will definitely have a cam in the new studio because the new studio
3517720	3519540	will be awesome, I hope.
3519540	3524140	Nintendo maniac 64 says, question for Loki, how does it feel to be surrounded by grown
3524140	3525140	gay men?
3525140	3529540	I don't, I don't get it.
3529540	3531820	I know, what's the big deal?
3531820	3534100	I don't know.
3534100	3537860	Ban him, he's homophobic, he's the one that broke Gay Gamer.
3537860	3541140	Speaking of which, you know, what do you think about that whole like GayGamer.net getting
3541140	3542140	targeted?
3542140	3543140	I felt really sad.
3543140	3548340	I met Flynn at Comic Con, and he's a really nice guy, so somebody doing that to his site
3548340	3549340	really kind of makes me...
3549340	3553260	Especially if it was all this hate crime and stuff, you know, that's so gay that somebody
3553260	3554260	would do that.
3554260	3555260	It really is.
3555260	3558500	It's a joke, people, bad joke, sorry.
3558500	3559860	I am gay, I can say that.
3559860	3561460	No, it's still bad.
3561460	3567380	NM64 says, how few frames per seconds do you predict your current PC would get while playing
3567380	3568380	Crysis?
3568380	3570640	I think mine would die.
3570640	3576640	As it is, shit, until I upgraded the video drivers, which I think they were current,
3576640	3579780	but for some reason it was having issues, because they installed like three different
3579780	3584460	sets of video drivers, they were all running concurrent.
3584460	3589260	You know, ever since I did that, my computer before that was just resetting randomly, it
3589260	3590260	was just boops!
3590260	3591260	Dop.
3591260	3592260	I used to have that problem.
3592260	3594480	And I was like, fucking A, I'm gonna have to buy another PC.
3594480	3597740	I did though, this weekend though, I bought a magazine, because I'm actually looking to
3597740	3604660	buy a new PC, or build one, and unfortunately my dream PC is like $11,000, so I need to
3604660	3606380	scale down quite a bit.
3606380	3607940	How do you make a, wow.
3607940	3612100	But they have a nice article, this PC game, or PC building bible, they have a build your
3612100	3617420	own game PC under $1400, and it looks nice, and it's all blue.
3617420	3624700	I want an all blue PC, somebody get me some paint, I'll paint my PC, and it'll be blue.
3624700	3627940	Or Rob will say it's purple, and try to trick me, but it's not going to be, it's going to
3627940	3628940	be blue.
3628940	3632740	Alright, one more AskBorne's Lounge question for you guys, and then we're gonna call it
3632740	3633740	a show.
3633740	3638620	Dark Tetsuya is asking, did you hear ID is releasing all their older stuff on Steam,
3638620	3640980	even as far back as the Commander Keen stuff?
3640980	3643300	What's a Commander Keen?
3643300	3644300	How old are you?
3644300	3647580	You're like a baby, you weren't around for Commander Keen, were you?
3647580	3652940	Commander Keen was kinda like, I don't know, like, ID's Mario game for the PC, I don't
3652940	3654380	know how else to explain it really.
3654380	3661940	It was like a side-scrolling game that was very it was fun though, a lot of folks that
3661940	3664020	had computers in the 90s remember.
3664020	3666140	It was the shit on shareware.
3666140	3667140	That's right.
3667140	3668140	It was awesome.
3668140	3669140	And all about jazz.
3669140	3671780	I actually did not, I heard, I know that name, but I don't know what it is.
3671780	3674700	I heard some of their other stuff was coming to Steam, but I didn't know the old stuff
3674700	3679060	was, they didn't, they didn't Freeware release that stuff a long time ago?
3679060	3680860	I don't know.
3680860	3683740	What was the other company that was with ID back then, Epic, right?
3683740	3685180	Epic Mega Games.
3685180	3686860	And didn't Epic do ZZT?
3686860	3687860	What's that?
3687860	3688860	Uh, yes.
3688860	3689860	ZZ Top?
3689860	3690860	No, no, no.
3690860	3693340	ZZT was like this totally awesome game.
3693340	3694340	It is.
3694340	3695340	Oh my gosh.
3695340	3696340	ZZT was rad.
3696340	3701540	So many, I was such a nerd that I spent so many hours making games.
3701540	3705100	You can make your own games, it was like a programming language for games, but it's hard
3705100	3706100	to explain.
3706100	3711860	It's all using ASCII characters, so your games would be very blocky and stuff, but as it
3711860	3718260	went on, they also released this new thing called Mega Zooks where you can create your
3718260	3721100	own games as well, but it was a little bit more intuitive.
3721100	3726980	They had, you know, Ooh, mod music, you could, you know, mod tracker stuff in there and just
3726980	3728800	all sorts of interesting things.
3728800	3734320	I want to say like years ago on this show, like we had an entire three hour conversation
3734320	3735820	about ZZT one night.
3735820	3736820	Like it's crazy.
3736820	3737820	It's what?
3737820	3738820	I have an excellent idea.
3738820	3740820	What, OLR the ZZT?
3740820	3747820	We need a contest, a game designing contest in ZZT sponsored by OLR.
3747820	3748820	That would be awesome.
3748820	3749820	All right.
3749820	3752420	We'll, we'll work out the details and come up with that for a future program.
3752420	3753420	That would be awesome.
3753420	3754820	Is there still ZZT programming communities?
3754820	3755820	Oh, we can find it.
3755820	3757580	There's gotta be somewhere.
3757580	3760860	Shadow Slayer says, I swear this guy is making these games up.
3760860	3762060	Put it on Wikipedia or something.
3762060	3763260	I'm not making this shit up.
3763260	3765220	ZZT is a real game.
3765220	3768340	Hitstun says, fuck the unreal engine ZZT forever.
3768340	3769340	Amen.
3769340	3776540	I'm glad your listeners are old.
3776540	3779860	Would you allow them to use super ZZT or any of the other ZZT months?
3779860	3781180	I didn't like super ZZT.
3781180	3785780	If anything, we'd either do it in the original ZZT or we would do Mega Zooks cause Mega Zooks
3785780	3786780	was pretty awesome.
3786780	3788000	You can do a lot of cool shit in that.
3788000	3790800	I want to have, I'm banging on the desk because I have a great idea.
3790800	3793980	You know, one thing I've said I wanted to do for orange lounge in our new season, we
3793980	3799380	get to the new studio is more interviews, we need to get people who made ZZT on the
3799380	3800380	program.
3800380	3801380	Just to talk about ZZT.
3801380	3803340	I want to talk about it.
3803340	3804340	Interview me.
3804340	3808060	I wear a top hat and a monocle and a mustache so I can pretend I'm old.
3808060	3810020	You can pretend you're Colonel Mustard.
3810020	3811020	What?
3811020	3812020	He didn't wear a top hat.
3812020	3813740	I'll get a cane too.
3813740	3815780	I'll be like, yes, that's ZZT.
3815780	3816780	Here it is.
3816780	3818100	Here it is in Wikipedia.
3818100	3819100	It's right there.
3819100	3820100	Oh, it had color?
3820100	3821660	Yes, it did have color.
3821660	3823340	They had color back when we were kids.
3823340	3824340	Imagine that.
3824340	3825340	It's crazy.
3825340	3828140	It was created in 1991 by Tim Sweeney of Epic Games.
3828140	3831020	Wasn't it you who I asked about color TVs?
3831020	3832020	Yes.
3832020	3837740	I asked if he watched, what it was like if you were asking me like what seeing color
3837740	3845540	TV was like for the first time and I was serious because I didn't know how old do you think
3845540	3846540	he is?
3846540	3850580	And he asked me how black and white TV was back in the day and I'm thinking like, well,
3850580	3853980	they used to show Dennis the Menace reruns on Nickelodeon in black and white, but that
3853980	3854980	was about it.
3854980	3855980	I didn't know.
3855980	3862220	It was a time though that I did have an old ass, it was a 286 system, it was like a 28620
3862220	3866460	or something like that with the whole 32 megs of hard drive space.
3866460	3871820	And anyways, so there was one game we had because we had just these really budget ass
3871820	3872820	games.
3872820	3876340	It was like a, what was it, a Muppets game or something like that and because it was
3876340	3880140	on a black and white monitor, you had to play it on like a CGA monitor or something like
3880140	3883580	that, which was four colors and they all sucked.
3883580	3885180	It was fucking hard to see it.
3885180	3889580	You couldn't see and wanted to push a button or something so it just went blank screen.
3889580	3892900	Finally one day we were like, I think I see something on there.
3892900	3896980	And so we hit the button and then we found out, oh look, the game sucks.
3896980	3903020	Loki look at this, it's a screenshot from the town of ZZT featuring the bank of ZZT.
3903020	3908140	The bank of ZZT and the whole program, that first, because you can play through, there's
3908140	3911220	like this huge game and stuff that you can play through on there.
3911220	3916820	And then the actual, the game that it came with was locked so you couldn't edit it.
3916820	3920500	But there was a program that you can hack the thing and actually unlock it.
3920500	3924340	And man, the bank little program thing was kind of complicated.
3924340	3925820	It was pretty cool looking.
3925820	3931100	But shit, I remember my friends, we used to be like real into like Robotech and shit and
3931100	3935220	he would make like Robotech ZZT levels and all sorts of weird stuff.
3935220	3939300	Oh my god, remember Code Red, which was one of the add-on packs for ZZT?
3939300	3942980	No, no, like this huge series somebody made for ZZT.
3942980	3947700	There was a lot of really big series, I mean god, back in the day I used to be so into
3947700	3948700	that stuff.
3948700	3950420	Alright, we need to stop being so old.
3950420	3952420	So we're going to talk about this.
3952420	3954220	What, you got something else real quick?
3954220	3956700	No, I said we're going to just keep talking about this if we don't.
3956700	3961620	I do have some last minute stories, they're interesting, well I don't know if they're
3961620	3968620	interesting but we've got a picture of Big Brain Academy, the board game.
3968620	3973460	I love Big Brain Academy on the DS, that could be cool.
3973460	3978300	And it looks like it comes with your own, I don't know, crack scale?
3978300	3982140	Because there's like a weird scale on there.
3982140	3985060	I guess that's what that is, some sort of drug scale.
3985060	3988620	Train your brain to smoke more crack.
3988620	3992300	So that's kind of interesting.

4017920	4023200	Jaden has a tip for you Shane if you want to experience what black and white
4023200	4028100	TV was like turn the color setting all the way down on your color TV and you'll
4028100	4032100	have a black and white TV. Why would I do that? I don't even know how to do that on my TV.
4032100	4035420	Because you wanted to know what watching black and white TV was like so there you
4035420	4043120	go. Well I was asking to hear about it. Or watch the purple network. I'll flip you off.
4043120	4048960	I thought you didn't swear. It's not. It's my fingers. I remember having an old-ass TV and
4048960	4054080	trying to I was like ooh I get 13 channels that sucks let's see if I can
4054080	4061720	tune anything on and UHF oh no I get one Spanish channel that's about it. I have a
4061720	4066480	last-minute story hurry for those people that play Wow

4071800	4076800	normally sucks make your own flying mounts probably for siege stuff for the
4076800	4084840	new expansion but still that's pretty cool nerd whatever I hate you all right

4131440	4138680	just got released on the PSP version 1.11 RM which means rewind and mirror
4138680	4142120	mods so apparently this game has now become like Prince of Persia the sands
4142120	4145720	of time where you can play like Super Mario Brothers and oh no I fucked up
4145720	4151760	rewind that's pretty cool wait Nestor like a remix like Howard and
4151760	4157760	Nestor yes and also like the NES emulator on the PSP or every other
4157760	4162680	platform out there all right did you not get that reference cuz I got roles and
4162680	4166600	now I subscribe to Nintendo Power when I was little I saw the first issue in a
4166600	4169800	box somewhere it's all torn I probably don't anymore I remember the
4169800	4174080	Castlevania issue and the issue six or the last issue of the Nintendo fan club

4190320	4194640	supporting independent radio if you like the show tell two friends about our show

4198380	4201960	we're poor so we can't exactly buy advertisements and magazines so we rely
4201960	4204600	on your word of mouth if you enjoyed what you heard or if you didn't enjoy
4204600	4208120	what you hear tell people how much we suck cuz we'll still get listeners that
4208120	4212600	way and I'll make ourselves feel good so that's it and that's really really it
