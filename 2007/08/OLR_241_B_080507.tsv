549	6154	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 5th of 2007.
6915	10838	If you missed part A, our show is a little bit in limbo tonight, or a little bit broken.
11178	13000	First off, we have no Jamie tonight.
13420	17944	She's unfortunately had a family emergency, so we all are of course thinking about her at this time.
18004	22328	And definitely we'll be seeing her next week after she's got all that taken care of.
22708	24550	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
39087	40128	So it takes forever.
40168	44129	So we're here from the temporary Studio Loki and that's where we are tonight.
44169	48471	So if you notice a lot of our usual sound effects are missing or we kind of sound different, that's a big reason why.
48771	50232	But we're really excited about the new studio.
50252	51853	It's going to be so much more space than before.
52233	58396	I'm just worried about, it is a garage, it's an insulated garage, but I'm just worried about the heat issues.
59136	61237	And the echo because it's got a bad echo problem too.
61687	62048	We'll see.
62088	63549	We're going to try and make it work by next week.
63630	67034	So we're hoping to pull through for you for episode number 242.
67695	69678	In the meantime, let's get back into some gaming news.
69978	73082	And we're going to start off with some big news on the Xbox 360.
73803	75605	Big, big news on the Xbox 360.
76707	79751	The $50 price break has been all but confirmed.
80011	81673	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
100931	103573	is going to include Rockstar Table Tennis.
104033	106055	So you get a free game with it now, which is pretty awesome.
106415	112920	Even if the game is really only $20 because Rockstar Table Tennis was cut down in price, that's better than no game at all, right?
114121	121026	That is true, and they're still denying that they have a price cut coming, but I think we know better than that.
122207	124289	Usually Microsoft rumors end up to be true.
125089	128672	Yes, and of course that's made its rounds all over the internet.
129855	133796	Except that's not the only announcement coming this week.
135157	149442	Probably by now, by the time you download this podcast, you will have heard that all the new 360 systems coming out as of this week and into infinity, I guess, will now all have HDMI.
150643	150963	So...
151926	153747	Don't have to spend the big bucks for the elite.
154068	154668	Even the core.
154988	156149	Even the core system will have HDMI.
156389	170440	My theory of the core system, that's totally baseless, other than the fact that I just feel that not a lot of people are buying the core system, and there's some other stories that kind of collaborate that later in the show.
170500	172742	Wait a minute, so I don't understand how that works.
173002	175264	What about all the systems that are already out there?
175324	179587	Are they going to be coming off the shelves to make room for these HDMI-enabled machines, or what's going to happen?
179707	186550	No, it's just they'll have this extra SKU out there, and I don't know, maybe they'll drop the price even more.
187745	187985	Huh.
188385	189246	Very interesting.
189326	191788	So it's going to have all HDMI on it.
191828	199093	So now, is that to be competitive with PlayStation 3, or is that because too many people were bitching about the Elite is the only way to go to get that?
199133	204957	I mean, if you think about it, it's not a big surprise, because look at the Halo 3 system.
205097	208159	I mean, that's supposed to be coming out in September here.
208619	209520	And it's not a big surprise.
209540	212522	That's why they haven't announced the price for that yet, if you think about it, because...
213171	227816	You know, people will be like, well, hey, you know, isn't that supposed to be, if they announced it at like $399 or something, or $349 or whatever, people will be like, hey, well, why would I want to buy a premium system like buy the Halo one for, you know, the same price with HDMI?
228596	231217	Now, Alex Silvara in chat has a very excellent point.
231257	237559	I was thinking the same thing when I first heard this, is that, hmm, I need to figure out how to red ring my premium so I can get an HDMI model.
239013	239373	A hammer.
240654	243397	No, but seriously, could you use that warranty to your advantage?
243417	248381	Like somehow force your 360 to give you the red rings so when they send you a refurb, it has HDMI?
249182	255187	Well, you could wrap a towel around it and play it in an oven.
255227	256108	Try to overheat it?
256868	258069	Place it in an oven.
259230	259971	I don't know.
261252	262233	I don't know what happened, Mr. Gates.
262333	265015	I'm not recommending that you do that, but I'm just saying.
266773	272336	No, and this is not a real big deal because the systems out there right now, they don't have HDMI, but who cares?
272496	280260	I mean, I guess it sucks if you already bought one, but for a person like me, I don't have any HDMI TV, I could care less.
281021	283882	I know, is HDMI really that big a deal?
284223	289405	I mean, because I have a feeling the internet's going to make this story this week sound like this big, huge freaking deal.
289425	294168	And the other thing is that I'm guessing it will not have an HDMI cable with it either.
294568	298250	But the reason why is because there will be a cable that's coming out as well.
298370	303234	All this is going to be, you'll probably all know this by the time you hear the podcast.
303334	314721	So, you know, because also, of course, there was that GameStop thing, the leak to the internet that said, you know, the announcement's going to be made by the 8th or Wednesday.
314761	318223	So, yeah.
318343	319504	Not a big surprise, but...
320760	325685	Well, you know, this kind of supplements what Loki was saying earlier about possibly the core is going away completely.
326385	333672	Apparently, Xbox, there's rumors going around that Microsoft has plans to make a hard disk drive a requirement to play games.
334072	337755	In other words, that, I think, one Sega game a little while back had a long time ago.
337775	339257	You're going to start seeing them more games.
339297	343260	It was on, yeah, Sega Pro Soccer or something or other.
343280	344261	I don't know.
344341	344942	Some soccer...
347183	351285	Well, that the hard disk drive will actually be required for some later games.
352085	354966	That was on the early pack shot, too, for Call of Duty 4.
355527	360589	Now, you might remember that the original Xbox, they all had hard drives, and they would use the hard drive to their advantage.
360989	366612	It would take data off the disk, uncompress it, and then put it on the hard drive temporarily.
367192	368933	And so, basically, the loading times are smaller.
368953	374155	And if you've ever played Oblivion without a hard drive versus with a hard drive, very similar type of concept there.
374475	375857	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
391060	399992	I don't know many Xbox 360 owners without a hard drive unless they are seriously only buying a 360 for Madden or only buying it for select games.
400132	402615	Very, very casual types of 360 gamers.
403176	406500	Any, I think, hardcore gamer with a 360 probably has a hard drive.
410106	416491	So, also this week, you know, that was pretty... Sorry, I just want to go chat really, really quick, because some good points here.
416992	423797	RossDLUT says, of course, Final Fantasy XI, another very big game that requires a hard drive on the Xbox 360, of course.
423917	424217	Hello.
425538	429261	WonderDogHerald would like to point out, HDMI is a big deal when you spend $2,000 on a TV.
431883	433704	I think he bought a TV that was like $2,000.
433784	434644	I think he did.
434664	435225	I remember that.
435285	439006	RavensDolphin says Orange Launch Radio enforces bricking Xbox 360s.
439106	445729	No, we do not encourage you to brick your 360s because there's no guarantee you're going to get one replaced with HDMI.
446169	449910	SonOfDad is being very bold and says, HDMI is a big deal for snobs.
452231	457113	The other thing I'd like to mention, though, that Rockstar Table Tennis bundle that's out there,
457785	458045	and so on.
478703	480304	There's three different SKUs that they have.
480344	506692	They have Rockstar's Table Tennis, Top Spin 2, which both of those have kind of leaked out on the internet now, and Amp 3 was the last one that they had that I didn't see anyone having that, but then again, the game's out of print also, so it wouldn't surprise me, though, if they had maybe Ridge Racer, that'd be kind of cool, but those three I know were being sold in January as well, so that's probably also why the one that they did leak with Top Spin 2, I think,
507327	507887	had a price of $3.99.
530716	550029	Now this is kind of interesting because you remember last week or two weeks ago we were here back here on the show we were talking about Halo on the DS we talked about like how Microsoft games could they really come out for the DS and I think even one of the emails are gonna get to later gets into this but it should be noted that at Comic-Con during a Viva Pinata panel of all things did you go to the Viva Pinata panel at Comic-Con?
550189	551890	Totally didn't.
552151	552471	I figured.
552931	558875	Rare has actually announced they are going to be releasing a Nintendo DS version of Viva Pinata.
559855	561816	So kind of interesting there.
562497	564818	Rare is actually developing it themselves.
564898	566659	It's not a copy of the Xbox 360 game.
566699	567379	It's different.
568100	571842	Gameplay-wise, they say it's the same game, but it is going to be a different game.
572663	580630	So kind of interesting because that's weird because Rare is obviously a Microsoft subsidiary now and now they're putting out a game on the Nintendo DS.
580670	582532	But at the same time, it makes a lot of sense.
582933	588158	If Xbox is not getting into the handheld realm anytime soon, lots of kids have Nintendo DSs.
588778	592443	Viva Pinata is not just a game on the 360, but a cartoon series.
592683	595787	They're trying to draw in the kids and make it a new Pokemon type thing.
595847	596848	Here's the thing I'm wondering.
596988	599591	Who's going to be publishing this game?
599651	600632	Is it going to be Microsoft?
600813	607901	Because that would be interesting if it's Microsoft publishing it, or if it's actually going to be Rare developing it and Nintendo publishing it.
608906	609267	Who knows?
610207	610528	Who knows?
610588	611408	I don't think it says here.
612029	613210	I guess it says.
613770	619515	The article says it sounds like Microsoft is publishing it, but I don't think we know that for sure just yet, and I could be wrong, though.
622158	636370	Anyways, so another thing also that's very interesting and kind of a little weird, the new X and A package for PC, you might remember Microsoft's kind of game development kit,
637239	641462	actually has support for Wiimotes, for inputs for using that.
641622	648567	So that's a little interesting that you can make gesture-controlled games for Windows-based PCs.
650929	656733	Wait, so, I mean, because people with XNA can play these games that they make on their Xbox 360, correct?
657473	657653	Yeah.
658093	664518	So, in other words, people are going to be able, now they're going to have Viva Pinata on the DS, and they can build games that use the Wiimotes...
665003	665643	Not necessarily.
665663	668485	They have different libraries for both the PC and the 360.
668925	679891	So it's not going to allow you to play Wii games or games that use the Wii Remote on your Xbox 360, but you can play them on your PC.
680191	680851	Oh, that makes sense.
680871	682992	Because I was going to say, how can you plug in that infrared bar?
683052	683452	You can't.
683993	687935	It's just the Wiimote and the sensors that are in that, the accelerometers and all that.
687955	691797	You really need to plug in the bar anyways because it's just two infrared lights.
692037	692657	I guess that's true.
693197	694618	That's still kind of interesting.
695556	701500	It doesn't have Bluetooth on it, so it'd be a little hard to connect those Wii remotes to the system.
702421	705984	Ross Steel UT in our chatroom would like to point out Microsoft has published for DS before.
706044	707325	There was a MechaSalt game for it.
708526	709066	So there you go.
709166	714450	And Ross Steel UT also says, this only proves that Microsoft is smart enough to stay the fuck away from the portable market.
715063	715463	There you go.
716664	718225	Raven's Dolphin says it's a fair trade.
718265	720186	They get Viva Pinata and they get Wiimote.
720486	730252	But that's not – I mean to say Microsoft is getting the Wiimote, that's a little bit jumping to conclusions because I think it's – this is a very minor thing, and it's not like XNA games.
730592	736836	I don't think we've seen anything made in XNA actually go to the marketplace yet unless that – what about that – what was it?
737056	738037	Aegis Wing?
738417	739418	Was that an XNA game?
739758	740598	The one they give out for free?
740639	740739	Yeah.
741039	741219	Yeah.
741759	744822	So that's like the only one though that I can think of that actually has gone to life.
744842	746564	There are more coming, it's just that's the first one.
747045	751469	But I don't think you're going to just like see suddenly a random game that requires Wiimotes.
752530	756014	For the exact reason that Loki brought up before, it's only really going to work on the PC.
757130	758371	It's just kind of interesting.
758671	760733	I mean, there's really no other word for it that I can think of.
760753	763455	It's just interesting that these worlds are colliding like this.
764676	765437	So, go figure.
766878	767318	Let's see.
767518	771301	Also interesting is a release that's coming out in Japan.
771722	779068	It's getting Japan all prepped for Halo 3 because, of course, Halo 3, you know it's going to be a big deal in this country, but in Japan, eh...
779828	782251	Did it top the Amazon list at one point?
797865	802448	for roughly the equivalent of $25 US is a history pack.
803149	804690	It's the Halo history pack.
804750	806231	It's Halo and Halo 2.
807131	816678	And they're releasing... Obviously, these were Xbox games, but they are going to release them in Japan, I guess, with discs that have built-in backwards compatibility updates on them.
816778	820240	So you just can pop them in the Xbox 360s in Japan.
820520	824002	And I guess the thought is that maybe this will get some hype going for Halo 3.
824062	824102	So...
825343	826503	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
854192	855633	I'm not eating right now, so ha!
856174	856794	I'm done eating.
858675	865920	Anywho, there's going to be... Halo 3 pre-orders are everywhere, including 7-Eleven now.
866380	876066	Yes, you can go buy a Slurpee or a Simpsons-themed item, and you can also pre-order Halo 3.
876106	876346	Why?
878308	878568	Why?
879824	880084	I guess.
903311	906712	It's just weird because you don't usually think of 7-Eleven as a place to go get your games.
907052	909973	But honestly, if that's a nationwide thing, has that been confirmed to be nationwide?
910513	911033	What's going on?
911453	911813	I don't know.
911833	913014	Is that franchise to franchise?
913834	916235	I would think probably franchise to franchise.
917235	919436	If they did that around here, I might seriously consider it.
919476	921316	I mean, who else is going to pre-order at freaking 7-Eleven?
921516	924117	I always thought 7-Eleven was a place to go play Street Fighter 2.
925057	928238	DJ Dark Knight says they sold Halo 2 at 7-Eleven too.
928338	931359	Apparently a lot of people are forgetting about that.
933663	938545	Bandit says, the week, and again, all these comments coming from our live chat room, chat.orangelantre.com.
938885	942407	Bandit says, the week Halo 3 comes out, so many 7-Elevens are going to get robbed.
943507	944087	So many of them.
945248	949089	And Jvmon says, didn't 7-Eleven have the Wii price in a contest ad once?
949750	951090	Sort of, but that was a contest.
951150	952411	Contests are different, I would think.
954461	969982	Alex Silvara says since they turned 7-Elevens into Quickie Marts maybe turn a few into Pillars of Autumn there you go turn them into some Halo themed stores there that could be interesting and expensive very expensive and ridiculous yeah it would be a little bit ridiculous where the hell am I
970915	974418	There's a brand new Xbox 360 repair website.
974438	987648	If you head on over in your browser in Internet Explorer or Firefox to service.xbox.com, there's a brand new site just set up pretty much to deal with the Red Rings of Death and other things related to Xbox 360 failures.
988288	993492	It's all automated now, and it's probably to reduce the stress on those poor call center reps that have to take all your angry calls.
994192	999116	You can register your console on the site, schedule the repairs, and keep track of them all through the website.
999637	1016470	And the site will also give you a $5 discount just in case your Xbox 360 is outside of warranty, like if it's not related to the Red Rings of Death or whatever, since I'm sure that's money that's being saved on the customer service end from not having to actually talk to you.
1018812	1022075	Ooh, $5 discount off of, like, what, $150 to repair that thing?
1024042	1024942	That's a little ridiculous.
1027344	1029805	This is extremely sad news for me.
1031786	1035287	Grand Theft Auto 4 has been delayed to next year.
1038509	1041650	I cannot tell you the utter disappointment that I've had.
1043471	1046893	I know at work, all of our Grand Theft Auto group, very disappointed.
1048193	1052215	But I guess the reason was, it just wasn't done yet.
1053308	1053788	Big game.
1053988	1055649	Want to make sure it's perfect.
1057150	1058130	And it just can't get done.
1059271	1066574	You know, but outside of you, the general consensus I'm feeling from the internet blogs and the internet websites is it's okay.
1067094	1071316	Now we have more time to play the other games that are all coming out this holiday season as well.
1071336	1072577	Like, it's more Halo time.
1072997	1074318	It's more Mass Effect time.
1074698	1076919	It's more, you know, whatever the hell you're playing.
1076939	1078219	Metroid Prime, whatever.
1078460	1080881	Now, if you've got to look at this, very interesting, though.
1081041	1081261	I mean...
1081721	1100207	This actually, I think, hurts Sony, because if you look at it, Sony for, you know, first party titles and stuff coming out in the fall, they had, like, Heavenly Sword, Lair, Ratchet and Clank Future, and, you know, I guess SingStar or not, Eye of Judgment, I mean...
1101048	1103569	Those aren't... I mean, Heavenly Sword is going to be awesome.
1104049	1105290	Lair is going to be pretty awesome.
1105350	1108131	And then Ratchet & Clank, you know, definitely a good game.
1108632	1110773	But those don't sell systems.
1110893	1113434	Grand Theft Auto 4 would sell systems.
1113914	1116815	And I know it's ridiculous because, yeah, it's coming out on the 360 as well.
1116895	1121918	But still, you know, some people are Sony loyalists and they will buy their system when the game comes out.
1121938	1126760	There really is something about that PlayStation name that is going to keep a lot of people with PlayStation.
1126900	1127520	But here's the thing.
1127640	1128901	Now that it's not coming out...
1129901	1134305	People are going to start thinking, hey, I just can't wait anymore.
1135186	1137167	Now you've got Halo 3 coming out.
1137187	1141731	It's going to sell even more now that there's nothing competing with it, at least around that same time.
1143312	1145955	Plus, Microsoft has a really strong lineup for the fall.
1147036	1148637	Shit, that's going to really hurt them.
1149574	1164729	I mean, granted, the game's gonna still sell like crazy when it comes out, because now there's gonna be nothing competing with it, but that's still more time and less units out there for Sony, and that's also more opportunity for them to lose even more exclusives if they can't have a good holiday season.
1165350	1172113	What about the rumors that part of the reason of the delay is the PlayStation 3 development and that it's coding problems?
1172654	1175115	Somebody just brought that up in chat, and also I remember reading that somewhere.
1175155	1175975	But I don't know.
1176015	1178697	There's part of me that felt that that was a little bit fanboyish.
1178777	1180017	I didn't know whether to believe it or not.
1180117	1181398	I don't know if it's true or not.
1181618	1191223	I mean, I could see it because there are a lot of games lately from all different publishers and all different developers that have been delayed on the PlayStation 3 end because it is hard to develop for.
1191243	1192083	They're not used to it.
1192123	1193284	They're used to developing for the 360.
1194684	1216260	and you know just developing for the sell is a lot harder so it's possible I don't think it's true but I just think the game is just not done it was a pretty aggressive deadline there they're trying to meet and you know they probably just want to make sure it's perfect because the game is going to be open to a crap load of scrutiny right hell yeah so especially from our very own Loki
1218162	1221043	All right, well, you know, that's not the only game to get delayed.
1221203	1223844	I know probably not quite as many of you were looking forward to this.
1224345	1230087	It's opened up to say that Blacksite Area 51, of course, Area 51 being one of their popular shooting games.
1230948	1234989	Well, this new Area 51 game was coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
1235510	1240352	It has been bumped back to November 5th, which isn't a huge delay.
1240512	1244994	I mean, it's not like what we're looking at for the other games there, but it has been bumped back to November.
1246047	1249710	And funny enough, there's no demo for the PlayStation 3 yet on their service.
1250050	1252271	I think there was one supposed to be coming out later this month.
1253332	1254733	Possibly development issues.
1256314	1260377	And there's another thing also, too, that we're forgetting about, and I'm going to cover this right now.
1261438	1265801	There's another game delayed, Lair, which is supposed to be coming out actually next week.
1265961	1267142	It's now coming out on September 4th.
1268098	1291356	and the reason why it's being delayed is to enhance community features in the game because if you remember, Lair is going to be one of the first games that supports home in both their trophy system as well as being able to launch the game from home and stuff like that so some of these games also coming out in the fall may be delayed with some of those features in mind as well
1293303	1293864	Interesting.
1295845	1297407	That doesn't seem like that huge of a delay, though.
1297427	1299629	Is that really enough time to fix everything?
1299969	1300810	I guess it is.
1301511	1301771	Huh.
1302672	1302952	Strange.
1304318	1306660	Alright, well, we're going to get into the mailbag.
1306700	1307881	We can't delay that anymore.
1308001	1312043	It's been two weeks coming, and we want to get to your emails and hear from some of you folks.
1312564	1317808	And unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here tonight, but filling in tonight for the mailbag is the one and only Miklatov.
1317988	1318508	Me!
1318648	1319088	A.K.A.
1319128	1319389	Shane.
1319789	1322211	So, unfortunately, we don't have the music tonight, so I'll sing.
1322691	1323692	I don't know how it goes.
1323972	1325313	Which one is the mailbag?
1325333	1329816	Oh, yeah, we're used to singing the song off-sync.
1329856	1331037	Alright, whatever.
1331697	1332458	Get into the mailbag.
1332778	1333939	Who emailed us this week?
1334235	1337376	Well, the first one is from Richard.
1337917	1340718	I'm not going to say his last name because that might be inappropriate.
1340938	1342079	You could use the last initial.
1342399	1349102	M. The letter M. It says, hey guys, I just felt like saying hi because you guys are so cool.
1349662	1351703	It was a real bummer you didn't have a show last week.
1352358	1353859	It feels like it's been longer though.
1354399	1358501	Also, I just found my Golden Sun game and was wondering did you ever like playing it?
1358861	1361802	Because it seriously, to me, lacks the information giving.
1362142	1365083	Meaning it doesn't always let me know where I need to go or do.
1365684	1368885	And is the new Tales of game for PSP any good?
1368905	1371686	And I already said who it was by, so I'm not going to say it again.
1371969	1374811	and he needs to learn how to use commas because he used them incorrectly.
1374831	1376452	Oh my god, it's just like having Jamie here.
1377633	1379734	Shane's complaining about the grammar of the emails.
1379754	1380494	This is amazing.
1381015	1381995	I'm sorry.
1382216	1383697	I honestly don't know a lot.
1383717	1385378	I played the crap out of Golden Sun.
1385398	1386358	Well, then you answer that.
1387499	1393443	I loved it up until I put it down for two days and he's dead on where it doesn't tell you what you're supposed to do ever.
1394183	1400027	So putting it down for two days meant I couldn't play it anymore because I forgot what I was doing and there was nothing to help me figure out what I was doing.
1400527	1404889	Except for the internet, and I don't think I really used the internet much at that time when it came out.
1405409	1408810	But yeah, it's a great game if you remember what you're doing or keep track of it.
1409611	1410851	I don't know anything about a Tales game.
1411111	1412972	Loki, do you know anything about a Tales game?
1413752	1420915	There was a Tales game... There's a new Tales game I know coming out.
1421315	1422636	I haven't heard too much about it, though.
1423883	1427725	I will try to read up on it very quickly while you read the next email.
1427785	1428605	Look how long this is.
1428625	1429285	Did I have to read it all?
1429305	1430086	Yeah, just read it.
1430146	1435648	Okay, this is from Scott L. Wait, crap, he has like a pseudonym at the bottom.
1435668	1436708	Maybe I'll just wait till that.
1436728	1438189	That's not from Scott L at all.
1444515	1451221	Hey Yet Again was listening to this week's Part B and had a couple of responses.
1452262	1451221	1.
1452682	1455665	I had a 360 break on me with the disc scratching problem.
1456145	1463071	This was one day after I bought it and had originally set it up on my coffee table while I made sure I had everything set up correctly. 2.
1463857	1472403	Once it was running smoothly, I gently picked it up to move it onto my entertainment center, and next thing I knew, I heard a horrible loud grinding sound.
1473084	1480870	I had only lifted it about an inch off the table, and had lifted it gently without tilting it at all.
1481750	1484132	It not only ruined my disc, but when I put it
1484741	1487323	When I put another disc in it, I don't want to read this anymore.
1487343	1490826	This is really long and boring.
1490886	1495949	Okay, the gist of what he's saying is it scratched that disc as well once he put another one in to test it.
1497290	1499952	And he learns his error of his ways.
1500593	1501253	Exactly.
1501353	1503115	Don't move the system while it's on.
1505616	1508859	He says it was near the system's launch and he had no idea it would happen.
1509928	1538648	he has had lots of machines that uses disks from PS1 on as well as PCs and I've never had this happen before when I moved them he got a replacement and things have been smooth sailing at first but he wanted to let everyone know that the disk scratching problem is a blatant fault in the 360 hardware and can happen with the slightest movement it doesn't require shaking or tilting it even though it sounds like any sort of jostling just picking it up is enough to break it
1539568	1540850	MechaSoul and Age of Empires Halo Halo
1560949	1561890	Cheers, y'all.
1562430	1563671	Hero antagonist.
1563691	1565893	You're the worst email reader ever.
1565993	1567994	Did you see how long this is, though?
1568014	1569795	We just kept going on and on.
1569815	1570816	Then summarize.
1571056	1571516	I did.
1571536	1572277	I tried.
1572697	1578721	Really quickly, the chat room has some comments here about where we did not know much about the Tales of series.
1578761	1579862	Our chat room fills in here.
1580562	1584345	Alex Silvara says, Tales of the World, Radiant Mythology for the PSP.
1584685	1586046	Simply, it's awesome.
1586570	1587011	Oh, that's right.
1587071	1588073	That's the game that came out.
1588233	1592080	And Zappy says the PSP Tales of is a fan service for Tales of fan.
1593362	1593743	There you go.
1594404	1594885	Hooray.
1596488	1599713	Next email is from Reesimo.
1601683	1610709	Hey guys, I've been a faithful listener for about a year and a half now.
1610970	1617934	I've been in the chat room a few times, but I'm often too busy to listen to you live, so I just download the podcast to my PSP.
1618455	1625820	I think the three of you offer so much to the gaming community and find it sad that many gamers that listen to podcasts haven't heard of you.
1627731	1628311	The end!
1629812	1630512	Come on, keep going.
1631472	1635314	I love the extreme sarcasm and angst that Jamie offers.
1635774	1637654	Matt's rants are incredibly entertaining.
1638075	1640976	And Rob is just too fracking adorable.
1641776	1644257	I know you're moving... Oh, the word was fucking?
1644437	1645397	Was that the word, Shane?
1645417	1646658	There's more, there's more.
1648359	1649540	Hey, I'm adorable.
1649600	1650101	That's great.
1650742	1655569	I know you're moving the studio soon and just wanted to know about any possible changes.
1656430	1658292	I really hope you guys add video.
1658413	1659134	Please consider it.
1659294	1661337	Loki, I agree with you on the zapper.
1661837	1664822	Just try to homosexual your anger a little.
1665442	1667445	I don't even know what that means.
1686862	1691724	Sound Voyager for the GBA Unfortunately, it's an import only from Japan, but since it's handheld, it's region-free
1715166	1720990	Anyway, I've not played the game, but according to reviews, it's supposedly more enjoyable to play this game with your eyes closed.
1721550	1726634	If you or anyone else is interested, now is a good time to pick it up from PlayAsia because it's on sale for $15.
1727094	1729996	Ooh, those are all the bit generation games.
1730036	1731857	I bought one of them, which I didn't like.
1731877	1732517	Sound Voyager?
1732678	1733538	No, it wasn't Sound Voyager.
1733678	1736260	I saw... But, I mean, that's one of the bit generation ones.
1736300	1737140	Yeah, that's one of them.
1737241	1738982	It's generation two, I think, but...
1739803	1742647	They're awesome games for the Game Boy Advance.
1742787	1744510	Just be careful.
1744550	1747334	There's one I got Colorists or whatever that's not very fun.
1747354	1748476	I didn't really know how to play it.
1749337	1750920	It ends with hope this helps some people out.
1751140	1751681	Apollo.
1752643	1753203	Hooray.
1754249	1755010	That was a good email.
1755270	1757391	It's not a happy email.
1758792	1762174	Unlike the one that was just complimenting you or the guy that writes too much.
1763996	1764556	You're rude.
1764676	1767878	Alright, if you want to send an email, we promise Jamie will be back next week.
1768078	1769559	She's just as mean as I am.
1770420	1771701	Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.
1771721	1773142	Maybe we're going to have Loki read them.
1773182	1773942	He's a little nicer.
1774062	1776124	Who can we get in here that's nice to the listeners?
1776204	1776824	I'm nice.
1777264	1781307	Not when you have to write a whole crap about stuff that's not interesting.
1781347	1783368	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
1784869	1788010	And now it looks like homosexual your anger might be the new catch line.
1788910	1790091	I started something worse.
1791611	1792091	Like what?
1792691	1793972	Than what you had before.
1795072	1800193	I don't understand how the last one makes sense, what you guys said, but I don't understand how this one makes even more sense.
1800273	1807095	It had something to do... It was that week that the game, we speculated, we didn't know that the word was spastic.
1807495	1813177	Some video game had the word spastic in it, and we speculated that the word was retarded, because we didn't realize the cultural differences.
1813257	1813617	I don't...
1813917	1815358	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1842964	1843764	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1865320	1867642	Laura Roslin Talk a little more about sports games
1885233	1887533	Remember that whole you're an asshole thing we were talking about earlier?
1887853	1888634	I like winning 11.
1889294	1889754	There we go.
1890294	1890754	Well, there you go.
1890794	1894555	Do you like Major League Baseball Power Pros?
1895655	1897155	Oh, the Konami game.
1897335	1898775	Well, it's Konami and 2K Sports.
1898795	1899715	That's what makes this interesting.
1899756	1901636	The two of them are actually teaming up to put out this game.
1901676	1902676	Oh, what system is it for?
1904376	1907877	It is coming out for... That's a very good question.
1907917	1908637	I haven't gotten there yet.
1908877	1910397	Gosh, Nintendo Wii and something like that.
1910437	1912658	Yeah, I totally saw that in the office.
1912718	1913418	It looked awesome.
1914418	1915618	Are you even allowed to tell us that?
1915878	1917039	What office is left?
1917259	1917579	Okay.
1918959	1919440	Seriously.
1919460	1920260	Can you tell us more?
1921700	1925701	It was adorable because everybody had big heads and big eyes.
1926862	1928082	And it was pretty cool.
1928482	1928862	I don't know.
1929142	1930183	I just saw people playing it.
1930303	1933924	Well, the press release boasts that there's a dozen different game modes in the game.
1934544	1936345	It's going to have long-term playability.
1936385	1938746	It'll have, of course, a season mode, as most sports games do.
1939146	1940506	Success mode, as well.
1941026	1944047	In season mode, you become a Major League Baseball team general manager.
1944068	1945488	And, of course, what is the ultimate goal?
1945768	1946969	To win the World Series.
1947369	1951810	Success mode, though, has more traditional role-playing elements and other baseball scenarios in it.
1952310	1955932	And they're calling this mode unique and compelling, which, you know, of course, press releases.
1955992	1958913	I don't think it's either of those, but it did look like a lot of fun.
1959033	1961334	So I would highly recommend it if you like baseball games.
1961374	1962374	And that's what it's really about.
1963464	1964685	to some people.
1965065	1966745	It's not going to be the graphics, that's for sure.
1966765	1973928	See, and now there's people in chat going, no, don't talk about sports games, or Raven's Dolphin says, Sky talking baseball makes me want to go kill myself.
1974989	1976249	I love going to baseball games.
1976329	1978190	I'm just saying the games are kind of boring as of late.
1978210	1979391	It's cheapy and cute.
1979511	1979751	I mean...
1980431	1981992	Even I love baseball stars on the internet.
1982012	1985633	There's the occasional sports game that I will... Like the Ken Griffey games were really fun on the Super Nintendo.
1985653	1986514	Or like Double Dribble.
1986574	1987774	How can you not love NBA Jam?
1988034	1988294	Hello.
1988615	1992236	Yeah, but... You know, just because you don't play Madden doesn't mean you have to hate all sports games.
1992276	1992776	Yeah, that's true.
1992796	1996538	I mean, Madden is just a little hardcore for maybe some people that don't follow football.
1996578	1997218	Maybe it's a bit much.
1997258	2000199	Football's fun to watch, but it's not... I don't understand it.
2000259	2002140	If you play racing games, that's a sport.
2002280	2002620	Hello.
2003421	2005502	They tried to make DDR a sport, guys.
2005582	2006142	Come on.
2006762	2008623	Well, that's a whole nother, you know...
2009584	2010604	Sports games can be good.
2010624	2016906	This one, if you like baseball and you don't mind cute little things, it's going to be good.
2018666	2028429	One thing that may be good if you're holding out for All-Pro Football 2K8, apparently sales of All-Pro Football 2K8 were...
2030635	2031775	Okay, I guess.
2033176	2038237	I guess 2K was not terribly pleased and not terribly disappointed.
2039537	2044318	So, the rumor is that it may be dropping price with the upcoming Madden release.
2045278	2051140	So, if it's going to drop price, that would probably be by next week then, since, well, that's when Madden comes out.
2052694	2053715	I don't know, looks pretty cool.
2054175	2067382	I did see some funny videos though online of OJ Simpson and there was this one team, I can't remember what it was, but they had a, one of their mascots was this guy with a knife and he was stabbing.
2068423	2072925	It was funny, so the fun things you can do with all pro football.
2074746	2077968	OL Army Ninja in chat says, you guess a lot, Loki.
2077988	2078068	Yeah.
2080968	2082349	Super Smash Bros.
2082449	2082649	Brawl
2107947	2108408	Super Smash Bros.
2108428	2108568	Melee
2132048	2132889	Here's a quote from the story.
2132909	2134189	It's really something you won't see anywhere else.
2159093	2162514	That sounds kind of cool, because it sounds like it could be something that's almost by itself.
2163354	2163874	Go figure.
2164975	2168636	Something else I want to say really quickly, though, because I noticed it didn't make the show roll.
2168676	2170576	There's some other information that hit the Smash Bros.
2170616	2173697	Dojo this week at SmashBrothers.com, and that is another newcomer.
2174057	2174677	It's Ike.
2175357	2180739	And Ike you may have never heard of before, unless you play Fire Emblem, because Ike comes from the Fire Emblem series.
2180859	2184720	He comes from, I think, the GameCube one, which probably sold about five copies.
2185140	2185320	Well...
2185760	2190583	Well, whatever you feel about Fire Emblem, Ike is going to be one of the characters in the game.
2190603	2193284	It's just like a character you'd have a crush on, Miklatov.
2193424	2195706	I totally do, because he's got blue hair.
2196146	2201409	Well, hopefully the Wii version is going to sell a little bit more, because they do have the Wii one coming out in November here.
2201649	2205491	Okay, Loki, I have a question for you, because Shane's going to yell at me if I say this.
2205711	2207112	Loki, is his hair blue or purple?
2209809	2212371	From here, it looks kind of dark blue.
2213212	2214873	Oh, your eyes suck.
2215054	2216114	It's purple to me.
2217155	2218536	There's this inside.
2218556	2219357	It's not even a joke.
2219377	2219557	It's true.
2219617	2220138	It's indigo.
2220218	2220858	I swear his hair is purple.
2227540	2228861	Well, I'll fight you for it.
2228921	2230582	It looks a little, it's bluey purple.
2230602	2234285	Well, I'll tell you, well, I don't know.
2235005	2247254	Another interesting thing, we've talked about this numerous times before, but the Neo Geo is coming to the Virtual Console, and now it is confirmed on Nintendo's Virtual Console website in Japan.
2247874	2254519	They do show the Neo Geo there, and also have a spot for another console that's yet unnamed.
2256052	2260894	Dreamcast, Commodore 64, MSX There's also Elevator Action, which is now called Spy Game Elevator Action
2281540	2282341	It's gross.
2282361	2282741	But it's true.
2309841	2311942	There's no games that you get that super excited about.
2313323	2314124	Silent Hill.
2314184	2314524	See?
2314804	2315445	Pump It Up.
2315465	2315985	That's gross.
2316546	2317887	Whatever, both of those games are amazing.
2317907	2321649	You did see that there's a new Pump It Up coming again to PSP.
2322110	2325012	I actually was talking to Rob about that today and I wanted to cry.
2325772	2329435	And I was making fun of him because the game will probably have his favorite pump song of all time in it.
2329575	2331936	It probably will and it's really going to make me sad.
2332057	2333237	Which for the record is Lizenka.
2333377	2333558	Yes.
2335560	2337081	I don't know if you like any of these songs.
2337121	2339724	I mean, maybe Guitar Hero 3 will make you feel better, Miklatov.
2339784	2341947	There is one song on there that does make me feel better.
2342187	2343509	Oh, I'm curious to know what it is.
2343569	2347093	There are some new songs that were just announced.
2347273	2348514	And of course, it seems like...
2349315	2357722	Whenever there's a new Guitar Heroes game, whether it's the 80s edition or the 30s, it seems like the songs keep slowly rolling out to keep this game in the press.
2358502	2360764	I will tell you no or yes when you read off the list.
2361625	2372554	Miss Murder by A.I., Threes and Sevens by Queen of the Stone Age, Raining Blood by Stare, Reptilia by The Strokes, Paranoid by Black Sabbath, Cities on Flame by Blue Oyster Cult, Mississippi Queen by Mountain.
2372874	2373654	You didn't read enough.
2373674	2373995	That's it.
2374035	2375136	That's the seven new songs.
2375216	2376557	No, there's another new one.
2377077	2377698	I swear.
2377938	2382042	There was a dragon in there which they showed the- That video was crazy.
2382723	2383844	Through the fire and flames.
2383884	2384325	Yes.
2384565	2385646	Oh my god.
2385906	2386847	I don't know why.
2387648	2391192	It does remind me of stuff you'd see in like Guitar Freaks and stuff.
2391212	2391412	Yeah.
2391432	2393154	Just insanely fast.
2393834	2395136	Made no sense really.
2395336	2397278	It's just like, oh my god.
2398098	2400019	I like Cherub Rock by the Smashing Pumpkins.
2400079	2400859	That looks like it would be cool.
2400879	2402240	Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones.
2402260	2403020	That's kind of awesome.
2403920	2405601	Sabotage by Beastie Boys.
2405641	2407681	Hey, this might be tenacious D songs in there.
2408282	2409622	My Name is Jonas by Weezer.
2409902	2412123	I'm still thinking that Rock Band is going to outdo this.
2412423	2413803	From everything I understand about them two.
2413843	2416865	I'll probably buy them both because I'm such a whore for music games.
2416925	2418005	I don't know.
2418025	2421066	Have you seen footage of Guitar Hero 3 since Neversoft took it over?
2421086	2421166	Yeah.
2421506	2422387	It looks kind of weird.
2422847	2423347	It's alright.
2423868	2426750	DDR looked kind of weird when it went over to the Xbox, but you get used to it.
2426770	2427951	It still kind of looks weird.
2430893	2432994	I like how you can give us a more honest opinion now.
2433995	2437117	I don't think I ever was not honest about how I felt about the game.
2437137	2439518	Shane, what do you think about DDR Hottest Party?
2440079	2441260	I think it's a piece of crap.
2446191	2447092	Oh, man.
2448494	2449635	I'm way too honest.
2450056	2452719	We probably ought to move on to the next topic, Loki.
2453801	2456324	Yeah, speaking of weird and kind of crappy...
2458103	2459083	Guitar Hero.
2459304	2461445	It's been spotted in the arcade.
2464206	2467387	Actually, they had a wonderful shot of it on Kotaku.
2467868	2471469	It was a game in a Bangkok arcade.
2471869	2474291	What's funny about it is there's no guitar.
2474511	2475231	It's just Guitar Hero.
2475251	2479753	Why are you giggling at him talking about a game in Bangkok if you don't have a perverted mind, Shane?
2479893	2481094	No, I'm not laughing at that.
2481134	2481934	I'll tell you later.
2482094	2483135	Go on with your story.
2484211	2486872	What's funny though is the whole game looks like poppin' music.
2487713	2495056	It's got basically giant buttons for each of the fret buttons and I guess you play it a little bit like poppin' music.
2498017	2502619	One might say though it's kind of ripping off of Beatmania so that's kind of ironic.
2504420	2508563	So all you do is you just hit the buttons down and that's like an automatic strumming too?
2508964	2511806	I don't know, but it would just be poppin' music.
2511826	2513087	I was just saying it's poppin' music.
2514148	2514928	Poppin' Hero.
2516169	2517430	That's a terrible name.
2517971	2520413	It sounds like a popcorn game.
2520493	2523075	By the way, I just want to point out, this is what Shane's doing during the show.
2523115	2524376	You know why he started laughing?
2525116	2526918	It had nothing to do with the whole Bangkok thing.
2527218	2532362	He's reading Big Brother 8 live updates and giggling at them and the housemates calling each other dirty names.
2533002	2535365	That's what really goes on here in the OLR studio.
2535925	2537547	Hey, don't get off topic.
2537687	2539429	Continue with your video games discussion.
2539709	2540550	Oh, okay, I will.
2541331	2544153	So would you play Guitar Hero in the arcade if it was like poppin' music?
2544173	2547557	I may try it once just to say that I played it, and that's about it.
2547617	2548738	I like poppin' in the arcade.
2548758	2549339	It would be fun.
2549479	2550079	It would be cool.
2550420	2554764	I'm sure it's like playing Unjama Lamy in the arcade, which I played one time.
2554784	2555064	Unjama Lamy.
2555585	2556546	It was very strange.
2557812	2561956	First off, it's made for little kids, so I had to get on my knees to play this game.
2562677	2563217	Shut up!
2564999	2572185	Because I'm really tall, unlike little Asian girls, and I had to squat down to play.
2573486	2574808	Never mind, I'm not going to finish the story.
2574848	2578731	Was it like trying to use a little kid urinal or something like that?
2578751	2581854	Like they did in Billy Madison, where he has to squat down and he falls over?
2586195	2586655	Let's see.
2587195	2588835	Ross Steel UT says you hit the buttons.
2588915	2590636	Isn't that every fucking rhythm game ever?
2591616	2592056	Kinda.
2592476	2596237	Hit them with your feet, hit them with your hands, hit them with the strumming, hit them with your voice.
2597277	2599038	You can't hit buttons with your voice.
2599238	2601058	You can if you sing really bad.
2602478	2604419	Some people say my voice pushes people's buttons.
2610346	2610607	Dead Air
2625246	2626246	That rumbles.
2626807	2632069	And yes, we've been hearing this story on and off, and Loki has been insisting for weeks and weeks that yes, this is coming.
2632449	2637350	But apparently, various Sony developers do have their hands on the 6-axis with rumble.
2637691	2644113	Rumor is it could be their big announcement at the convention in Germany, the Leipzig convention.
2644473	2647114	Congratulations for spending $499 on your brand new 60-gig PlayStation 3 system.
2650399	2652761	Also, congratulations, you're now going to have to buy new controllers.
2652801	2653101	Thank you.
2654322	2655903	What's also funny is they actually did come out.
2656243	2656504	Why not?
2656524	2658205	The same thing happened on PS1 and PS2.
2658365	2658945	Oh, yeah.
2659366	2659586	Wait.
2659966	2662808	But they didn't say Rumble is last generation then.
2662868	2666771	PS1 didn't have the little analog sticks.
2666791	2668052	PS2 didn't have Rumble to begin with.
2668132	2669553	I have a PS2 controller that doesn't have Rumble.
2669713	2669973	Really?
2670134	2670294	Yes.
2671094	2673175	I swear they had... I bought mine at launch.
2673195	2673855	They had it at launch.
2673875	2676435	Then why the fuck doesn't my PlayStation 2 controller rumble?
2676775	2677375	Is it broken?
2677535	2677836	No.
2677856	2681096	Are you sure it's a PlayStation 2 controller?
2681116	2681536	I'm sure.
2681596	2683837	It could be just an... A black PS1 controller?
2683857	2684677	Yeah, they had those.
2684837	2685257	Did they?
2686057	2686417	Son of a bitch.
2686437	2689198	Yeah, because I remember I bought mine at launch and it worked.
2689278	2690598	All right, God.
2690658	2691718	I failed, Jesus.
2691738	2697720	I do remember, though, having to buy the DualShock controllers at one time, so yeah, that makes sense.
2698220	2698500	But...
2699060	2703461	You know, this is something that they took away and now they're putting back.
2703822	2707763	But they said they justified taking it away because it was a last generation feature.
2708603	2708923	Oh, okay.
2708943	2710544	Because Rumble is so last gen.
2710564	2711844	Welcome to last gen, Sony.
2712824	2715885	They're all, well, last gen sold better than this gen, so let's go back.
2717066	2718006	I think that's what they're doing.
2718246	2721027	They're like, maybe if we can just make it like the PS2, it'll sell.
2721047	2724028	Anyways.
2724048	2724348	Anyways.
2726124	2729945	So, another interesting thing, Warhawk is finally, the price point has been announced.
2730906	2740068	We knew before that the retail version was going to be $59.99, and that was going to include a Bluetooth headset, as well as some extra bonus behind-the-scenes crap.
2740908	2748310	And now the online version, probably the most expensive download I think you'll ever see on a console, well, so far at least.
2749236	2752760	is $39.99 to download this game.
2753701	2755122	You thought Luminous was expensive.
2756824	2764051	Actually, if you add it up, if you add up the game itself and then all the fucking little packs they have with it, maybe it's getting close.
2764111	2764691	It's probably about $25.
2764731	2767054	That's before we even get to packs.
2767274	2770697	I mean, what makes you think that Warhawk's not going to have downloadable content?
2770717	2771478	Good point, good point.
2773263	2774564	All right, so are you going to buy this, though?
2774824	2774984	Nope.
2775345	2775485	No.
2776305	2779888	I do not like online-only multiplayer games.
2780829	2781189	That's true.
2781209	2782330	No more MMOs?
2782430	2784832	That's what turned me off to... MMOs are different.
2784872	2789535	This is just like straight, you know, online-only multiplayer.
2789675	2791357	It feels like half a game to me.
2791417	2799883	It's like taking the online portion of your single-player first-person shooter and just, well, we didn't feel like creating this story, so let's just make the game.
2800481	2809910	Okay, the chat room is all like saying, you know, and I appreciate the chat room and their comments, but they're all like, Sky, have you turned on the rumble and the various games?
2810631	2812592	Give me a little credit here, people.
2812813	2817958	I mean, okay, I've been doing an internet radio program about video games with my friends for five years.
2818318	2825605	Okay, give me a little bit of the benefit of the doubt that I know how to turn these features on in games and check and see, you know, all this stuff.
2826586	2829950	I realize I'm not perfect, and I don't get things right all the time.
2830010	2832032	We're human, but please.
2832173	2835717	I'm trying to remember if yours even has the little button in the middle to turn on.
2835837	2836157	It does.
2838408	2839168	And we're back, folks.
2839208	2839828	Sorry about that.
2839948	2841129	We don't know what happened.
2841409	2842349	I can tell you what happened.
2842369	2844990	This Skype mess with the settings there.
2845090	2846270	Well, live radio, boys and girls.
2846290	2847390	We're in the temporary studio.
2847430	2847970	What can you do?
2848470	2849231	These things happen.
2849271	2852571	Now, I don't know what the last thing the folks heard was, though, before we went to the Skype line.
2852591	2854912	So quickly give us the last story again real quick there.
2855152	2855692	Sorry, folks.
2855792	2856332	Live radio.
2856372	2856832	Things happen.
2856952	2857713	The last story?
2857993	2858773	Like which story?
2859654	2860875	Story about the start of the read?
2861175	2861395	Okay.
2862836	2869459	Okay, anyways, so we were going to cover one story that we ran on the website about the Tokyo Game Show list for Sega.
2870939	2872100	That makes me sad.
2872180	2873721	And that looks really awesome.
2873821	2875462	It's such a wonderful list.
2875542	2877564	Even like Fighters Megamix 2 and stuff.
2877604	2878484	I was like, oh, hell yeah.
2878504	2880025	New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio.
2880065	2882447	New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio, yeah.
2882507	2882807	Guess what?
2882827	2883548	It's fake.
2884308	2888191	Because it was too much of a Sega fanboy's dream.
2888351	2890352	And we posted that on our website.
2890433	2891053	Awesome job.
2891433	2892274	Awesome job, everybody.
2892850	2894291	Now, how did it get debunked?
2895031	2898673	The original source actually has posted a retraction and apology.
2900233	2904755	Saying, we lied because we made all of those up because people wanted to hear that.
2905015	2907677	Yeah, so they are a big douche, apparently.
2907757	2908117	It says...
2911310	2918856	There has been a lot of controversy regarding the recently posted rumor regarding Sega's possible Tokyo Game Show lineup.
2919337	2935611	Now, I was originally very defensive of this piece, and because of who sent it in, his longtime go-to guy named Rob has sent me exclusive tips of four years, and until this most recent one, all were accurate.
2937547	2950238	and apparently Rob says sorry guys says that I'm sorry for this whole AMS I assure you that this is not this will not happen again I have to say I applaud you guys for being right on top of this
2951039	2952839	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2952899	2956600	I think really some of those games sounded plausible up until you hit Shenmue 3.
2957020	2959701	I can tell you one thing, though, that will be a Tokyo Game Show this year.
2961922	2963982	I don't know if you can get excited about this or not.
2964002	2965062	Probably not.
2965382	2969543	But a new Sonic Riders game, Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, will be there.
2969583	2971384	It's coming out on the Wii and PlayStation 2.
2972344	2975145	Actually, around the same time as the first one came out last year.
2975425	2975825	Around...
2977901	2979062	February, I believe.
2979082	2985685	If it was a new version of Sonic R with the same awesome music, maybe I'd care, but... Yeah, it's just not.
2986165	2990567	Riders was okay, it was an alright game, but... I don't know.
2991027	2991427	Put this away.
2991727	2994509	As long as it controls better than Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3 and 360.
2994809	2996529	I'm fine with that.
2996850	2999531	Ooh, that's a burn right there, because that game sucks.
3001004	3002945	All right, so I'm very sorry, guys.
3002965	3004626	We're not going to be able to do the Skype line tonight.
3004706	3010470	Live radio and things are broken and it's not running at the same time as our recording software does.
3010570	3011310	So that's okay.
3011330	3012411	We'll bring it back next week.
3012991	3014833	We'll take more calls next week to make up for it.
3014873	3017114	But we will do some Ask Orange Lounge tonight.
3017134	3018615	We do have our chat room is still working.
3018635	3020036	You guys can interact with us through that.
3020436	3020937	Thanks for watching!
3039107	3042908	You can probably go in there and adjust it so that it's lined in and stuff.
3043068	3043449	I don't know.
3044029	3045189	Do you even try?
3045530	3045950	I don't know.
3046210	3050472	At this point, let's just... Do we really want to break the show further tonight?
3050552	3050972	Yeah!
3051592	3053433	Might as well go all or nothing.
3053473	3054374	Let's go all the way, man.
3054414	3055474	Let's break the show.
3056055	3056315	Alright.
3056575	3059977	Well, there are some comments in chat about the whole Sega thing going on.
3060177	3063238	RossDLUT says, Sega doesn't know how to make good games anymore.
3063298	3064759	How could you not know this was fake?
3066235	3068677	They do ruin all their franchises they touch lately.
3068697	3072160	And also, if you looked at that list, that's a huge fucking list.
3072220	3074282	I mean, there's no way they're working on that much.
3074382	3077564	The only thing that was missing from it was like Panzer Dragoon Saga 2.
3078245	3078825	That was it.
3079346	3080727	Everything else is like, fanboy.
3083276	3084137	Um, let's see.
3086538	3088039	Raven's Dolphin says, no Skype.
3088119	3090061	Wow, OLR is having my kind of failure.
3090621	3091121	There you go.
3091242	3093863	DarkTetsuya said they should make a new Jet Set Radio for the Wii anyway.
3094203	3095504	Not for the Wii, make it for the 360.
3096445	3098386	DarkTetsuya says, or hell, a new Samba de Amigo.
3098606	3098947	Yes.
3099147	3100528	I found my Samba stuff.
3100548	3101428	I know, I saw them.
3101468	3105491	You see that they had a Samba de Amigo listed as a PSP title on it?
3105511	3107832	Yeah, what are you going to do, shake your stupid PSP?
3108533	3108613	Oh!
3109153	3109333	I like it.
3109353	3109553	Alright.
3127714	3132156	So we promised we'd do some Ask Orange Lounge, so I'm going to read some questions here from our chat room.
3132196	3134497	And unfortunately, we don't have the theme music unless Shane wants to sing it.
3134877	3136317	What's the theme music?
3136357	3139079	Same as the mailbag music, because we're cheap here on this program.
3139339	3139879	No, thank you.
3140119	3142660	All right, let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
3142700	3143480	Let's start off with this.
3144101	3146121	It's probably a stupid question indeed.
3146161	3147182	Well, it's from Raven's Dolphin.
3148002	3150405	Take it as you will.
3151306	3154269	Raven's Dolphin says, Sky, how come you do not talk about your iBook?
3154309	3155650	Because I got a MacBook and like it.
3157072	3159234	I'm playing with it, so he can't talk about it.
3159694	3160696	I like my iBook.
3161556	3165801	It's the only internet I have right now because that's how I'm able to steal the neighbor's Wi-Fi.
3166699	3168320	The screensaver is really pretty.
3168641	3170542	Well, you can choose from several different screensavers.
3170562	3171423	I don't know if you're aware.
3172243	3174185	I think there's much more to the Mac than just the screensaver.
3174205	3174665	I doubt it.
3175445	3175706	Oh, yeah.
3175886	3180089	There's being able to play WoW on it, but very badly because I can't fly down.
3180489	3184392	For me, who does a lot of work on the road and who travels a lot, it's great.
3185072	3187054	I love the Mac for that stuff.
3187234	3189616	And it's got a great DVD authoring program on it.
3189816	3190416	I will give it that.
3191697	3192778	Let's go to some more questions.
3192818	3195580	Of course, Ask Orange Lounge tonight in lieu of the Skype line.
3196389	3198711	Since we do not have the Skype line tonight.
3199111	3201553	DJ Janai asks, how was moving last week?
3202634	3206957	It was long and tedious, and I'm very glad to be done with it.
3207037	3210340	And the new house that I live in is so much better than the apartment I was in before.
3211261	3217125	With no disrespect to Extifer, because living with Extifer was fun, but just the place itself is so much better now.
3217145	3219627	We're in a house, there's actually a backyard and a lawn to mow.
3220291	3220591	Alex Silvara
3247372	3250998	Does anyone like the Dynasty Samurai Warriors series besides me?
3251078	3254082	Oh, I did hear there's a new incarnation coming out on Xbox 360.
3257930	3261433	They're gonna be doing Dynasty Warriors Gundam, that's coming out in August.
3261493	3268498	And then they've got that Warriors Orochi, which is coming out in September, which is pretty much Dynasty Warriors mixed with Samurai Warriors.
3268879	3270880	And to be honest, I couldn't tell the two apart.
3271661	3280088	And now there's Dynasty Warriors 6, which actually looks like they did something with the series and made it look a little bit better on 360, so...
3283250	3283651	I don't know.
3284291	3290458	Gameplay-wise, they haven't changed anything, but graphically, it looks like they haven't changed anything either, so... I don't know.
3290578	3292200	Not much I could really be excited about.
3293401	3295924	Although there is Samurai Warrior Katana later this year, so...
3298815	3301056	Going over to a question from RossDLUT.
3301096	3304137	Here's actually a really good question and something that wasn't brought up earlier in the show.
3304557	3308238	With the recent raids on mod chippers, the internet's pretty much gone nuts.
3308638	3313680	The question I have is, well, are people so selfish that they feel gamers shouldn't have to support game companies?
3314160	3319362	Personally, I'd rather XSEED were able to make profits than have 500 pirates to every one importer.
3321167	3322127	Interesting point.
3322267	3327068	I mean, because there's been those raids going on apparently about all these people that will mod chip your systems.
3327128	3329189	I'm very curious to hear what you think about this, Loki.
3329849	3331689	About modding and stuff like that?
3331809	3333009	And all the crackdowns and all that?
3333469	3345952	Well, I mean, what they're doing is violating the law, but at the same time, there's ways around things that you don't necessarily have to put a hardware mod chip into it in order to be able to play stuff from other countries.
3346292	3347672	I think also the problem is...
3348391	3357877	Like, with a lot of these things, you know, games are expensive now, don't get me wrong, but at the same time, you know, people are kind of jaded with paying 60 bucks and getting crap.
3358297	3369123	They're getting hosed, and like, they kind of justify it in a way, well, fuck this, I wasted, you know, 60 bucks on Bomberman Act Zero, and I thought it was going to be a really awesome game, and it's just crap.
3369803	3371885	You know, and now I can't get my money back, so...
3372805	3374526	Fuck you, I'm gonna steal your next game.
3374666	3375787	You know, there's that.
3376227	3381931	There's also, you know, with importing, I don't understand why more systems are like the PlayStation 3 and the PSP.
3382412	3385114	You know, let people import their games if they want to.
3385194	3387075	Hell, it sells an extra copy for you.
3387115	3388556	You still make some money off of it.
3389096	3390858	And, you know, I don't think it's really hurting anything.
3390898	3393259	Okay, it's gonna be a Japanese version of the game or something.
3393539	3394180	Big deal.
3395650	3400473	I think in the big scope of things, too, there's so few people that actually import in the big scope of gaming.
3400593	3402534	It's not that big a deal, I don't think.
3403274	3408317	I mean, hell, how else did Elite Beat Agents get a release here but from people importing on and on?
3408597	3408997	Exactly.
3409317	3409877	And you know what?
3409938	3413900	Hey, look, my buying... GS68 just said the same damn thing in chat.
3415861	3419803	My buying Wangan Midnight, that's a whole one extra copy for them, and you know why I bought it?
3419883	3421664	Because there's not a lot of stuff coming out over here.
3422404	3424265	So, what the hell?
3426492	3440363	Yeah, you know, but as far as just like pirating to get a bunch of games for free, especially when you're downloading things like Halo 3 and Blue Dragon, you know, assumably when these games come out, Blue Dragon, kind of like this stuff, you know, you know it's not going to be like Barman X Heroes.
3440463	3441083	It's a little different.
3441103	3442584	Let me put it this way.
3442624	3443325	That's not okay.
3443385	3444566	Yeah, my PSP is modded.
3444726	3446468	Yes, I can play games without having to buy them.
3446988	3449710	But would I have bought those games if it wasn't modded?
3449970	3450731	No, I wouldn't have.
3451568	3454591	I just play games that are from other countries just to check them out.
3454971	3456672	I normally don't end up buying them.
3456833	3460656	I would have felt bad if I actually bought them because they sucked.
3461016	3462838	It's also not like you don't buy video games.
3462918	3466661	I mean, you have a shitload of video games everywhere in this house, so you buy a lot of video games.
3467281	3469763	I spend a lot of money on video games, and you know what?
3469923	3476489	If I can play something for free instead of paying for it, yeah, I'll do it because it frees up more money for buying something else.
3478312	3480935	Legend of Zaku has this for Ask Orange Lounge.
3481036	3482197	Bring back the camera.
3482277	3484019	Bringing back the webcam would be hot.
3484680	3487563	It looks like it is going to happen in the new studio, but we're just not sure.
3487743	3489365	I mean, getting a webcam in there isn't a problem.
3489405	3491087	Now it's just about delivering it to the site.
3491147	3492789	So we will have more information on that later.
3493950	3500134	Yes, we've seen the suggestions about, I don't know what, Justin TV, Operator 11, whatever site Travis Donovan's using.
3501295	3504677	We're looking into what we want to use and we'll have more information on that later.
3504697	3507619	I even thought about doing something in here if we had time.
3508180	3514004	So I buried the Xbox Vision camera because I haven't used it for anything yet.
3515071	3515652	Something soon.
3515712	3518578	We will definitely have a cam in the new studio because the new studio will be awesome.
3518979	3519219	I hope.
3519239	3521203	How does it feel to be surrounded by grown gay men?
3528128	3529528	I don't get it.
3529668	3529949	I know.
3530549	3531429	What's the big deal?
3532029	3532469	I don't know.
3533909	3534329	Ban him.
3534369	3535510	He's homophobic.
3535910	3537570	He's the one that broke Gay Gamer.
3537890	3541191	Speaking of which, what do you think about that whole GayGamer.net getting targeted?
3541231	3542231	I felt really sad.
3542291	3545431	I met Flynn at Comic Con, and he's a really nice guy.
3545771	3549172	So somebody doing that to his site really kind of makes me mad.
3549272	3551513	Especially if it was all this hate crime and stuff.
3552013	3553833	That's so gay that somebody would do that.
3554353	3559401	NM64 says, how few frames per second do you predict your current PC would get while playing Crysis?
3569301	3570281	I think mine would die.
3570642	3581986	As it is, shit, until I upgraded the video drivers, which I think they were current, but for some reason it was having issues because I installed like three different sets of video drivers that were all running concurrent.
3582006	3589109	You know, ever since I did that, my computer before that was just resetting randomly.
3589229	3590470	It would just boop, stop.
3590530	3591710	I used to have that problem.
3591790	3594211	And I was like, fucking A, I'm going to have to buy another PC.
3594631	3598773	I did, though, this weekend, though, I bought a magazine because I'm actually looking to buy a new PC.
3599383	3628372	or BuildOne and unfortunately my dream PC is like $11,000 so I need to scale down quite a bit but they have a nice article this PC game or PC building bible they have build your own game PC under $1,400 and it looks nice and it's all blue I want an all blue PC somebody get me some paint I'll paint my PC and it'll be blue or Rob will say it's purple and try to trick me but it's not going to be it's going to be blue
3629537	3630979	What's a Commander Keen?
3643269	3644089	How old are you?
3644149	3645150	You're like a baby.
3645170	3646870	You weren't around for Commander Keen, were you?
3647370	3652732	Commander Keen was kind of like, I don't know, like ID's Mario game for the PC.
3652772	3654292	I don't know how else to explain it, really.
3654412	3655772	It was like a side-scrolling game.
3655892	3657713	It had like crazy demons from hell?
3658253	3659053	I don't think so, no.
3659073	3659893	Then what's the point?
3659994	3660594	It was fun, though.
3660614	3663895	A lot of folks that had computers in the 90s remember this game.
3664035	3665455	It was the shit on shareware.
3665987	3666468	That's right.
3666888	3667429	It was awesome.
3667489	3668650	And all about Jasper Shakur.
3668770	3671714	I actually did not... I heard that name, but I don't know what it is.
3671874	3674758	I heard some of their other stuff was coming to Steam, but I didn't know the old stuff was.
3675298	3678322	They didn't freeware release that stuff a long time ago?
3678342	3679143	I don't know.
3680728	3681189	Epic MegaGames ZZT
3696912	3697572	What would you do?
3697592	3701495	I was such a nerd that I spent so many hours making games.
3701535	3702716	You can make your own games.
3702756	3704677	It was like a programming language for games.
3704717	3706618	But it's hard to explain.
3706739	3708400	It's all using ASCII characters.
3708580	3711021	So your games would be very blocky and stuff.
3711081	3716565	But as it went on, they also released this new thing called MegaZooks where you can create your own.
3716585	3717866	That's a terrible name.
3718166	3721047	Your own games as well, but it was a little bit more intuitive.
3721087	3723769	They had, you know, ooh, mod music.
3723829	3728811	You could, you know, mod tracker stuff in there and just all sorts of interesting things.
3728891	3735654	I want to say, like, years ago on this show, like, we had an entire three-hour conversation about ZZT one night.
3735714	3737255	Like, it's crazy.
3737515	3738475	I have an excellent idea.
3738515	3739696	What, OLR the ZZT?
3740116	3746279	We need a contest, a game design contest in ZZT sponsored by OLR.
3747745	3748486	That would be awesome.
3748606	3752349	Alright, we'll work out the details and come up with that for a future program.
3752369	3753330	That would be awesome.
3753350	3754891	Is there still ZZT programming communities?
3754911	3755411	Oh, we can find it.
3755612	3756612	There's gotta be somewhere.
3757693	3760335	Shadowslayer says, I swear this guy is making these games up.
3760776	3762097	Put it on Wikipedia or something.
3762137	3763098	I'm not making this shit up.
3763178	3764098	ZZT is a real game.
3765179	3768102	Hitstun says, fuck the Unreal Engine, ZZT forever.
3768262	3768582	Amen.
3769143	3771104	God, your listeners are old.
3772485	3772866	Shut up.
3776437	3779879	Would you allow them to use SuperZZT or any of the other ZZT mods?
3779899	3781039	I didn't like SuperZZT.
3781199	3785141	If anything, we'd either do it in the original ZZT or we would do MegaZooks.
3785201	3786661	Because MegaZooks was pretty awesome.
3786701	3788002	You can do a lot of cool shit in that.
3788122	3790743	I want to have... I'm banging on the desk because I have a great idea.
3790783	3795505	You know, one thing I've said I wanted to do for Orange Lounge in our new season, we'll use a new studio, is more interviews.
3795965	3799247	We need to get people who made ZZT on the program.
3799567	3800788	Just to talk about ZZT.
3800808	3802628	I don't want to talk about it.
3803089	3803749	Interview me.
3804530	3807980	I wear a top hat and a monocle and a mustache so I can pretend I'm old.
3808642	3810207	You can pretend you're Colonel Mustard?
3810307	3810488	What?
3810769	3811932	He didn't wear a top hat.
3812953	3814214	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3842893	3843473	No.
3844594	3846155	How old do you think he is?
3846255	3849198	And he asked me how black and white TV was back in the day.
3849218	3854401	And I'm thinking, like, well, they used to show Dennis the Menace reruns on Nickelodeon in black and white, but that was about it.
3854461	3855362	I didn't know.
3855422	3860446	There was a time, though, that I did have an old ass... It was a 286 system.
3860466	3863528	It was like a 28620 or something like that with the whole...
3864568	3892275	32 megs of hard drive space and anyways so there was one game we had because we had just these really budget ass games it was like a what was it a Muppets game or something like that and because it was on a black and white monitor you had to play it on like a CGA monitor or something like that which was you know four colors and they all sucked it was fucking hard to see it you couldn't see and you don't want to do the push a button or something so it just went blank screen finally one day we're like I think I see something on there and
3892890	3895751	And so we hit the button and then we found out, oh, look, the game sucks.
3896971	3897812	Loki, look at this.
3898012	3903053	It's a screenshot from the town of ZZT featuring the bank of ZZT.
3903073	3904014	The bank of ZZT.
3904134	3910596	And the whole program, that first, because you can play through, there's like this huge game and stuff that you can play through on there.
3911156	3916778	And then the actual, the game that it came with was locked, so you couldn't edit it.
3916798	3920259	But there was a program that you can hack the thing and actually unlock it.
3920939	3924555	And man, the bank little program thing was kind of complicated.
3924736	3925540	It was pretty cool looking.
3927051	3927451	Amazing.
3927491	3935376	I remember my friends, we used to be real into Robotech and shit, and he would make Robotech ZZT levels and all sorts of weird stuff.
3935436	3939218	Oh my god, I remember Code Red, which was one of the add-on packs for ZZT.
3939278	3942920	No, no, this huge series somebody made for ZZT.
3942940	3944941	There are a lot of really big series.
3945141	3948203	I mean, god, back in the day, I used to be so into that stuff.
3948243	3950084	Alright, we need to stop being so old.
3950384	3952225	We're gonna talk about this.
3953045	3954166	What, you got something else real quick?
3954306	3956428	No, I said we're gonna just keep talking about this if we don't.
3957068	3958729	I do have some last minute stories.
3958789	3959290	Yes, please.
3959490	3960310	They're interesting.
3961011	3967596	Well, I don't know if they're interesting, but we've got a picture of Big Brain Academy, the board game.
3968717	3971439	I love Big Brain Academy on the DS.
3971719	3972439	That could be cool.
3973380	3978084	And it looks like it comes with your own, I don't know, crack scale?
3978104	3980386	Because there's like a weird scale on there.
3982448	3984550	I guess that's what that is, some sort of drug scale.
3985811	3987933	Train your brain to smoke more crack.
3988574	3989975	So that's kind of interesting.
3992317	3994439	The Wii Remote's getting yet another strap.
3996846	3997667	Yay!
3999248	4000549	Hooray for straps!
4000909	4002631	Give it up for straps, everybody!
4003171	4003811	Alright!
4004112	4005813	Those Wii remotes are strapped, yo!
4007674	4008315	That's all I got.
4009015	4009456	That's it.
4009656	4010356	Alright, thank you.
4010717	4012398	No, but don't they have little clasps on them?
4013239	4015380	Yeah, there's straps with clasps on them.
4015400	4015861	Alright.
4016121	4017282	Woo, upgrades.
4017522	4019223	Oh, yeah.
4019343	4023987	Jaden has a tip for you, Shane, if you want to experience what black and white TV was like.
4024827	4029169	Turn the color setting all the way down on your color TV and you'll have a black and white TV.
4029609	4030489	Why would I do that?
4030509	4032390	I don't even know how to do that on my TV.
4032410	4035631	Because you wanted to know what watching black and white TV was like, so there you go.
4035651	4037232	Or watch the Purple Network.
4041912	4042933	I'll flip you off.
4044034	4045075	I thought you didn't swear.
4045095	4045876	That's not.
4045956	4046697	It's my fingers.
4047377	4052502	I remember having an old-ass TV and trying to... I was like, ooh, I get 13 channels.
4052542	4053023	That sucks.
4053403	4055785	Let's see if I can tune anything on in UHF.
4056586	4057307	Oh, no.
4057587	4059649	I get one Spanish channel, and that's about it.
4061619	4061739	NERD
4080450	4081030	Whatever.
4082231	4082791	I hate you.
4084612	4086133	Alright, we're going to wrap it up.
4086293	4088875	Let me talk about something old and boring.
4089235	4092257	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for tonight.
4092897	4097160	Shane, thank you for being here and contributing your unique perspective to our program.
4097980	4098460	You're welcome.
4098560	4099521	And your final thought, please.
4101443	4106525	I want to play the new expansion because it's blue and not purple, so shut up.
4107886	4111908	My final thought is I want to go see a movie because...
4113157	4113557	Yeah, I do.
4113577	4114858	I want to see Harrisburg.
4114878	4119201	I want to see a movie because I'm sick of moving and unpacking boxes.
4119401	4119842	So movie.
4120342	4121042	I'll think about it.
4121383	4121903	All right, thank you.
4121923	4122183	I will.
4122864	4123664	Loki, your final thought.
4124505	4134972	My final thought is yet another last-minute story, and it was Nestor J, the NES emulator, just got released on the PSP version 1.11 RM.
4136793	4147916	which means rewind and mirror mods so apparently this game has now become like Prince of Persia The Sands of Time where you can play like Super Mario Brothers and oh no I fucked up rewind that's pretty cool
4148735	4149816	Wait, Nestor?
4149856	4150837	It's like a remix.
4150957	4152217	Like Howard and Nestor?
4152498	4155860	Yes, and also like the NES emulator on the PSP.
4156640	4158782	Or every other platform out there.
4159222	4159642	Alright.
4160343	4162344	Did you not get that reference because we're old?
4162364	4163045	I got that.
4163065	4165306	No, because I subscribed to Nintendo Power when I was little.
4165586	4167247	I still have the first issue in a box somewhere.
4167267	4167808	It's all torn up.
4167848	4169329	I probably don't anymore.
4169409	4170650	But I remember the Castlevania issue.
4170850	4174172	And the issue 6, or the last issue of the Nintendo Fan Club.
4174652	4175673	I don't even know what that is.
4175713	4176574	No, that's before my time.
4176614	4176934	I know that.
4176954	4177474	Something else.
4179435	4180035	That's it, guys.
4180115	4183376	We're going to go now and call it a show.
4183496	4184516	So have a great night.
4184896	4187397	Until next week, go away.
4188257	4189237	We'll see you next time.
4189557	4191598	Thank you so much for supporting Independent Radio.
4192198	4202660	If you like the show, tell two friends about our show because that's how we get the word out because, of course, we don't – well, we're poor, so we can't exactly buy advertisements in magazines, so we rely on your word of mouth.
4202980	4208321	If you enjoyed what you heard or if you didn't enjoy what you hear, tell people how much we suck because we'll still get listeners that way.
4208621	4209683	and I'll make ourselves feel good.
4210103	4211025	So that's it.
4211646	4212627	And that's really, really it.
4212667	4213709	There's no outro tonight.
4213789	4216013	We lost all our music in the temporary studio, remember?
4216293	4220319	Orange Lounge, blah, blah, blah.
4220540	4222803	We're just going to end it right here.
4223845	4224245	Good night.
