Hello everybody out there on the internet.
Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
And yes, our show is a little bit broken tonight.
I mean, we were off for a week due to a studio move, meaning that the studio we used to record in is no more.
It's gone.
And we're actually in a temporary location tonight.
We call it Studio Loki.
Yes, and it's brought to us by the one and only Techmaster Loki, who's also here on the program tonight.
Yes, it is.
How are you doing, Loki?
I'm doing okay, and I'm still trying to untangle this microphone cord, but that's okay.
That's right.
So if you notice some things are a little bit different tonight, like our opening was not its usual self and some other things, the sound might be a little bit different than what you're used to.
This is why, because we're in our temporary home.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Xtifer Xtifer
She should be back next week with us here at Orange Lounge Radio, but I know the listeners and ourselves were all thinking of her and her family this week.
Meanwhile, let's talk about what's going on with the show.
Is that basically we moved, and of course the show taped out of the spare bedroom at the apartment I used to share with Extifer.
Well, we've moved on and Extifer's moved and I've moved into a new house.
And the cool thing is that we're going to tape out of the garage now, so it's going to be like this huge studio, but here's the problem.
We tried to call Comcast to get an appointment a week before we moved, just after we taped the last show, and they said they would not come out until August 7th.
So we were screwed with no internet at the house.
It has been hell trying to have internet at the house for this week.
There's been nothing.
Stolen Wi-Fi, that's it.
And we couldn't broadcast a show off of stolen Wi-Fi.
So we had to move to a temporary home this week.
So that's why we're at Studio Loki tonight.
And things are a little crazy.
But that's okay.
We didn't want to go two weeks of not having a show.
I mean, because we seriously considered it because of everything going on with Jamie and going on at the other studio.
But we just didn't want to have to go two weeks with no show because that can sometimes be suicide for listeners and everything.
We really appreciate those of you guys sticking with us.
Of course, we are in chat.
We have everything up.
We should hopefully still have Skype line tonight.
Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to join us in the chat room.
And of course, lots of gaming news tonight.
Loki's got something really big he wants to talk about in Part B. It's going to be really cool, so we'll talk about that a little later.
Alright, let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week?
So we'll start off, How Was Your Gaming Week, Loki?
Extremely busy.
That's basically how I can describe it.
I've played so much crap over the last few days, or actually the last couple weeks, that it's just ridiculous.
Well, let's start off with the PSP stuff.
I went back and played through a little bit more of WTF and that game is weird.
The more games I unlock, the weirder the game gets.
It's awesome though.
I recommend checking it out.
It's probably dirt cheap by now.
Um, another game I played actually just came out in the UK called State Shift.
It's a kind of a futuristic racing game.
I guess a little bit like Wipeout, but it's, you know, with cars or these futuristic vehicles.
Um, didn't care for it too much.
The cars drive like, you know, giant bricks with rockets on them, and it was impossible to make corners and stuff.
So, not a game I'd pick up, but then again, I'm not in the UK, so it doesn't matter.
Um...
Final Fantasy, I finished it finally, and I'm so glad I'm finished with it because those new dungeons that they added on with the PlayStation 1 release, just crap.
It's just like, oh, we need some dungeons, quick, let's make some.
I mean, and they have no continuity whatsoever, just crap.
And I was so pissed off at the game, so that's done.
Final Fantasy 2 I played it for about 5 minutes, turned it off because I didn't want to play it anymore.
The battle system is just not good.
What?
I love Final Fantasy 2.
I played it on the Game Boy Advance a lot.
You don't like it?
I don't like it.
You know, for me though, I think Final Fantasy 11 takes a lot from Final Fantasy 2.
I love Final Fantasy 2.
I think it's more fun than Final Fantasy 1.
I can't wait to play the PSP port.
Wait, so you have Final Fantasy 2 on PSP?
Yes.
And you're not playing it?
Yeah.
I think you should let me have it for a little while.
Might be fun.
I have no internet at home.
Take pity on me.
Maybe.
Alright.
Beyond the PSP, on the 360 I played quite a few things, including some demos I tried the demo for Beautiful Katamari, which a lot of people don't know is actually out there It's not on live, but if you happen to subscribe to the official Xbox magazine There is a demo disc for Beautiful Katamari in the September issue
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Actually, I'm pretty surprised.
I've been playing it quite a bit.
At first, you're like, well, maybe it should be slightly good because then the townsfolk will help you out with stuff.
Then eventually, they start pissing you off, and I think that they programmed that game that way on purpose.
So I just go through the towns and basically kill everybody, and I can do that over and over.
I've got my wenches, and it's awesome.
And then, let's see...
I also, on the PlayStation 3, I got my import copy of Wengen Midnight.
And that's pretty cool.
The game itself, though, graphically, looks like a PlayStation 2 game.
That's probably the only disappointing thing about it.
Otherwise, you know, I guess it's exactly like the arcade game.
Do you think they were originally building it for PlayStation 2 and just decided to... It came out for PlayStation 2, like, last year.
But it's not... I mean, the graphics, if you were to put it up against, like, you know, Need for Speed or...
I can't remember those are basically the main things
Alright, moving on.
MyGamingWeek, and I'm looking at chatroom at chat.orangelandredo.com JVmon says, Sky must be dying without World of Warcraft.
You know, I wasn't until I heard all the news from BlizzCon this week, which we'll get into in a little bit.
Nextfer's going to give us a report because he was there at BlizzCon.
But then when I heard all of that, I was like, I have to get my character to 70.
But before BlizzCon happened, I was doing okay with no World of Warcraft.
Because I was busy moving.
Like, you know, when you have all this...
Stuff you gotta get out of another place, and believe me, I have a lot of crap, okay?
I have a lot of crap.
So moving that kind of kept me busy and kept my mind off WoW.
But when I did finally get everything settled in and I had no internet, that didn't leave a whole lot to play.
So I went back to old PlayStation 2 games that I never really finished, and the first one that came to mind was Kingdom Hearts 2.
Because I played that game quite a ways in before the first time I played it, and then just kind of stopped.
So I'm just restarting that, and I pretty much caught up to where I was, and...
You know, Kingdom Hearts 2, yeah, I guess its biggest downfall is that the battle system is kind of a bit of button mashing, and it's nothing that intuitive, but I'll be damned if you don't just kind of immerse yourself in the world, and the way they tie things together is so great, and the voice acting is pretty darn good, except for Aerith, I hate her.
And everything else, the music and the graphics and the full motions, it's a great game.
One of my favorite PlayStation 2 games.
I don't remember the other game I played.
What's that?
Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3.
I played the demo for that.
Oh, the demo?
How was that?
It was very short, again, but it kind of reminds me a little bit of God of War, but it's a whole lot of button mashing, it seems like, because it's basically two buttons that you do certain moves with, and you can switch your weapon up a little bit.
But I don't know.
I'm probably going to pick it up just because there's not a whole lot coming out for the PlayStation 3, so it's worth my money.
Interesting comment.
DarkTetsuya says, Kingdom Hearts 3 should use something along the lines of Final Fantasy XII.
Final Fantasy XII did have a pretty awesome battle system, but I don't know if it would work in the Kingdom Hearts universe.
But a lot of people think that Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be different because I believe the creator has said, Kingdom Hearts 3 is not Kingdom Hearts 3.
It's something else in the Kingdom Hearts universe.
So, we'll see.
It's still a ways out before they announce anything.
RavensDolphin in chat says, Sky got so much stuff, moving a lot of gay porn books takes a lot of space.
You would know, RavensDolphin, you would.
Mikotov, how was your gaming week?
What kind of games did you play this week?
Well, I'll start with Sunday.
I was at Comic Con.
I was going to ask you to give us the Comic Con reports since you weren't here last week.
How was that?
Boring.
I don't like comics.
I went for Heroes and Battlestar, and I was happy with both of those.
But I got to play Silent Hill Origins, and I haven't played that since it was the behind-the-shoulder camera, and it's actually looking really good, and it was really fun.
It wasn't really scary because it's in a bright room with a lot of people, and you're playing it on a PSP.
But whatever, it was still cool.
Other than that, I played World of Warcraft, and I played Loki's demo of Beautiful Katamari, and that's really it.
Did you enjoy Beautiful Katamari?
Yes, it was a really fun three minutes.
Best three minutes you ever spent?
No, but it was a fun three minutes.
What would be the best three minutes you ever spent, game-wise?
Next question.
Oh my, alright.
Game-wise, game-wise.
Next question.
Fine, jerk.
All right, so that's it for your gaming week?
I think so.
I didn't really do much.
I never do much with WoW.
We've all been pretty boring between moving and all this other stuff.
Having my office closed.
That's right.
You've been moving out of your office.
Yeah.
Is everything okay?
You doing all right?
Yeah.
Was there any last hurrah?
Did everybody go out for drinks one last time or anything?
No, actually.
Nobody went out for drinks.
That's kind of sad.
It was weird.
All right.
We normally drink for no reason.
This was a reason and nobody drank.
I hope I'm okay to say this on the show, though, but as I understand, there's little bits and pieces that you collected for listeners in the future.
Yeah, and I'll give those to you to give away.
So more information at a later date on You Can Own a Piece of What Once Was Konami.
Aw, that's so sad.
How sad.
Why are we laughing?
I'm sorry.
Look how adorable.
It really is sad because I know we had a lot of fun.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Wow.
Next.
Oh my gosh, this is the worst radio.
Yes, DarkTitsui has summed it up in chat.
Worst radio ever.
Whatever, you're the worst radio ever.
This will be the last show from Studio Loki because this is what happens to the show.
All right, anyhow, housekeeping real quick.
We weren't here last week, so we weren't able to tell you guys that we got nominated in the podcast awards at podcastawards.com.
So thank you guys very much for helping us to get the nominations.
And the voting is now open.
So if you head on over to www.podcastwards.com, you can vote for Orange Launch Radio.
We're nominated for Best Gaming Podcast.
And it's really cool because lots of independent podcasts are nominated.
They upped it from 5 to 10 this year, and there's lots of independent podcasts nominated.
A lot of good shows, including our good buddies at All Games.
And they are...
Thank you for watching!
Hit those confirmation emails.
Just do it legitimately.
Don't cheat.
It is legitimate.
I was just going to say, it gives us a bad name.
It is legitimate.
I'm saying for the people out there.
I know.
Be legit and ethical.
I'm not saying use a program to do it or anything.
Please don't.
I'm just saying, you know, if you have email addresses, you can vote four times.
Seriously, people that...
People that are listening to gaming podcasts are probably so fucking sick about hearing about podcast awards.
Well, it was just nice to be nominated again.
Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
It's always lovely to be nominated.
But we want to win again, so... You know what's better than being nominated again?
Winning again.
That's what's even better.
No, I'm just teasing, really.
No, it really is great that we got nominated.
And the fact that there's a lot of shows that haven't been in there before.
It's all independent.
I hoard us out to my work again.
Those people...
Those people that do the shows that got nominated, you know, they don't get a lot of, I don't think any of them, I don't think any of them get paid to do their business.
ScrewAttack was on there.
Do they?
I don't know.
I don't even know.
Well, they're affiliated with, you know, GameTrailers.com.
Okay.
We need this!
We need this!
HURRAY FOR NOMINATIONS
Wrath of the Lich King Wrath of the Don King
Even though there's going to be no new races, there is going to be a new class, Death Knight.
So that's kind of fun.
And apparently every race can be a Death Knight.
So there's going to be lots of Death Knights.
And I've already reserved the name Death Cake so you can't have it for Death Knight.
Well, I was just going to say, you know, if you were like, say, Leroy Jenkins and he was a knight, he would be a Death Knight because he's dead in the game because he got killed.
How funny.
Anyways, what's not funny though is the fact that you may need Burning Crusade in order to play some aspects of Wrath of the Lich King.
Which is not surprising because I think with Burning Crusade it did raise the level cap and obviously you're not going to be able to go to 80 if you don't have Burning Crusade.
But they haven't really said exactly what will not be available if you don't have Burning Crusade.
Well also, it should be pointed out, there's some new battlegrounds and it's going to have siege warfare and buildings that you can destroy with your siege weapons, so that's going to be pretty awesome.
And then supposedly you're going to be able to customize your characters even further than what you can do now.
Yes, new hair, I can't wait.
That's good because it is kind of limited right now.
You know what the best thing so far about the expansion is?
What?
It's blue, like crazy.
I cannot wait.
Because it's ice and cold and all that stuff.
Yes, it's snowy and I'm so excited.
I could talk for hours about it, but I guess that's Christopher's job because he went there.
Well, let's talk to Christopher.
How was BlizzCon, Christopher?
First of all, how did you go?
It was a birthday thing, right?
Yeah, my sister got it for me for my birthday.
Oh, that was sweet.
And didn't think to invite us.
That's all right.
I know.
That's all right.
But it's $100 per ticket.
We would have bought it.
We would have bought it.
No, we were moving.
It's all good.
Well, tell us about what was it like when he got there?
What kind of stuff did they have going on?
Well, we got there pretty early in the morning on Friday morning because we wanted to get our badges.
And
Thank you for watching!
Waited for the doors to open.
They opened the doors.
When you walked in, it was really dark.
You could see the main hall, which is where they announced the expansion.
And it was in bright blue.
Yay, blue.
They had two big screens and a lot of chairs.
I mean, there was just, you know, and even everybody filled up the chairs and people were standing on the sidelines.
People were blocking everybody's view and
The opening ceremony was pretty good.
They talked about a lot of stuff, StarCraft II, World of Warcraft, and they showed us the trailer to the expansion, and that was pretty cool.
I think everybody knew StarCraft
The expansion was going to be called Wrath of the Lich King because in our maps it said there was a specific area that said World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King area.
So everybody was clued in as to what was coming.
Well, plus it had been leaked to the internet like two days before.
While you all were driving down, the whole internet knew thanks to some European thing.
I guess the official Blizzard site in Europe or something leaked it.
Yeah, they had the whole FAQ that's up now.
Yeah, still some people were skeptical.
They thought it was going to be Maelstrom, but I don't know.
The Wrath of the Lich King, we got to play it three times.
I personally, I really liked it.
What was the demo like?
What did you do in it?
Well, you start out in the Undercity area and you fly on a...
Whatever that is.
I think your computer just farted.
Okay, for those people not in the studio, that's the pipes from someone next door they're using and there's air in the pipes.
That was a cool noise.
That was a Silent Hill noise.
That was freaky.
I wish the folks at home could hear that.
Alright, so expansion.
Yeah, we got to play the expansion.
We start out in Undercity, ride a Zeppelin to the new Northrend area.
You don't really know where it is in Northrend, but just that it's in Northrend.
And it's the Howling Fjord or whatever, is that right?
Yes, that's correct.
I just couldn't remember.
There were so many names that you discovered in the expansion we didn't know where we were.
And pretty much you go to this grassy type area first.
There's a town and you're next to the ocean.
And you can go up.
You ride this lift up to the top.
And there's actually in the trailer for Wrath of the Lich King you see the top of the lift.
So you're kind of excited because you're playing a part that's in the trailer.
Then you can go to the right.
There was a lot of snowy area you can go into, and then there was a lot of burning woodsy areas.
Okay, too much detail.
Did they let you play Death Knight?
No, they don't let you play Death Knight, but they did play that trailer over and over and over and over again.
Did you get to do anything in the demo that you can't really already do in WoW right now?
Yeah, that's nothing really new.
You can do quests, but they weren't really new.
You could tell that they were holding off on that stuff.
It was just really kind of a way to explore the area.
There was a dungeon you can go to.
And so lots of nerds could go.
I played it first before any of you did in my murloc suit.
Really, I would say it was a good start.
Good effort.
Yeah, good effort.
And it wasn't like you couldn't go to the other areas that were already there because one of our players is a mage who can portal you and he portaled us to another city and it was kind of cool because we were the only three people there.
So yeah, it was kind of cool.
Cool.
How about StarCraft 2?
Did you get a chance to play that?
Yeah.
StarCraft 2, I've never played StarCraft before, let alone any game like StarCraft, so I was new to the whole genre.
But I can say that I really liked it.
I really enjoyed it.
Very good graphics, lots of detail.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
There were families there.
There were people that were fat and nasty there.
There were nerds, just like skinny, scrawny nerds.
There were hot people.
I mean, people dressed in Blood Elf costumes.
Now, you were saying before that Leroy Jenkins, the guy that does Leroy Jenkins, he was there.
He was there.
You were like wetting your pants over that guy.
He actually... Okay, Jay Moore, who is kind of the DJ...
of the whole event.
He did like a last comic standing, right?
Yeah.
Before he got fired.
He actually did a really good job.
There were some hecklers that kind of derailed the closing ceremony for a little bit, but he pulled it together.
Everybody was laughing.
He made even the most skeptical people.
There was one girl behind me that was
DJ Dark Knight in chat wants to know, were there Korean players there?
But he's no Jamie Kennedy, that's for sure.
Actually, there were Korean players there, mostly for StarCraft, but there were people that won the costume contests in the Korean Invitational that they did a few months ago, or a month ago or whatever.
They actually participated in the costume contest this year, and it was a warlock, and they were done very well, but it just so happens there was another warlock that topped them, and she was just incredible.
She was like, oh my god, she looked incredible.
But yeah, the Leroy Jenkins guy was there, and he did his Leroy Jenkins, and he was just too hot for words.
Wow, nerdy.
How was Video Games Live?
Awesome.
They did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft, as you can imagine.
But they also... Yeah, that's the one in one.
I'm sorry.
Anyways, they did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft, but they also did the new music from StarCraft II, which was sucky because it sounded exactly like Star Wars.
But we got to hear that, and we got to hear lots of music from Diablo.
And there was also a band that played last night called...
They were like this horde band.
It was totally manufactured by the makers of WoW.
You could tell because the creator of WoW was in the band.
But nevertheless, they were funny.
What were they called?
Level 70?
Level 70 Elite Torrin Chieftain.
Did they actually dress up like Torrin?
No, they actually didn't.
Like they were Gwar or something?
They didn't.
That sucks.
But they did, when you went and waited in the line to play Wrath of the Lich King...
There was a big screen next to them, and they kept playing the video that was game-made.
They made it in-game video for that, and it was just incredibly ridiculous, but it was funny, I guess.
But they have a song called Rogues Do It From Behind, which was just funny, because I'm a rogue, and I do it from behind.
I think I just threw up in my mouth.
Thank you.
I was going for that.
If only there was a camera to capture everybody's expressions just then.
So, yeah, the whole show was pretty good.
I had such a fun time.
Good deal.
Anything else you want to share that you think our listeners ought to know about?
What was the funniest thing that happened all show?
The funniest thing?
Yeah.
Oh, God.
All the nerds asking stupid questions at the panels.
They would say stuff like, okay, we're not going to answer these questions, and what do the nerds fucking do?
They ask those fucking questions.
Give us an example.
The movie panel, you said was one, right?
Movie panel, okay.
That was a big thing.
They're actually doing a movie.
The same people who did Batman Begins, Superman Returns, Legendary 300, or whatever.
They are doing the movie, and they are really standing by this film.
There was...
There were questions that they wouldn't answer though, and that was, those were, we won't answer questions on which races, which characters will be in the movies, but you can expect to maybe see these, and they listed these characters, right?
Everybody cheered.
Dark Knight wants to know, he would have asked, and will we be hearing Back Me Wool?
In the movie, anywhere.
We should.
Dip in the archives if you don't get that joke.
In fact, they said that there's going to be a lot of humor carried over from the game.
So they're looking forward to carrying some of the humor, but still keep it on a serious level.
You didn't tell them about what the worst part of the movie is so far.
Oh, well, they're going to tell it from the Alliance perspective.
Boo!
Alliance sucks!
Yeah, and the funny thing about it is that most people there, we got the feeling that most people there were in the horde.
Which is funny, because most people that play the game are Alliance, but they're all kids that can't afford to go to BlizzCon.
SonOfDad is in chat, wants to know, who's directing the film, did they say?
They don't have a director, there was somebody that asked that.
They want to get the script all together first, before they go search for a director.
And he said, oh, there was a funny story.
The guy that is with Legendary said that the guy who played Superman last year, he said they won't go into casting details, but they did say that last year he overheard the Legendary people on the phone with the WoW people, and he said, oh my god, can you get me a backstage tour of where they do WoW and all this stuff, and they did, and he went.
I seem to remember hearing something about that that guy was a WoW player, the guy who was Superman.
Yeah.
Thank you for watching!
Tell-A-Dressel
That's what it is.
Something like that, yeah.
So it's just kind of interesting.
Because he's Asian.
Shut up.
Let's see.
Looking at chat, another comment here.
DarkDeadCity wants to know, will the WoW movie be 60 hours long?
That would be awesome.
They said it's going to be between two and two and a half hours long.
Well, yes, it will be 60 hours long, but then you can buy an expansion for just $39.95 that will expand it to 70 hours long.
Yeah.
It was kind of funny because one of the people on the panel made a comment saying,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
RossDLUT in chat is like pulling up a pillow and blanket because he just doesn't care about WoW.
We don't care about whoever that was that you just said.
I don't care about WoW either.
All right.
Are you doing okay over there, Loki?
I'm doing fine.
All right.
Well, let's get on to some other news.
Thank you guys very much for your respective con reports.
Actually, Mikotov, yours was kind of bad.
I didn't really care about your report.
I didn't even really talk about it.
Yeah, you didn't really do anything.
Well,
Well, I could talk about it more, but I don't want to, because you're a jerk.
Tell us really, you know, I don't know, maybe if they don't like World of Warcraft, they like Battlestar, but please tell me about how you met the guy that played Tyrell and what you did.
Okay, spoilers maybe, just so everybody knows.
So the guy that plays Tyrell, Aaron Douglas, was at Comic-Con, and I went to go get his autograph.
And I went up to him, and I was like, can you write something mean about Callie, like...
Callie sucks and Callie is his wife on the show and I absolutely hate her and he laughed at me and then he started signing my thing I gave him to sign and he put Shane or to Shane Aaron Douglas chief I can't wait for Callie to die in season 4 episode 5 dot dot dot that was my favorite thing ever and I have something to look forward to
I'd just like to point out that Shane called me long distance right after this happened just to tell me about this experience.
Because it's important.
It was like the coolest thing ever.
Tech5 Tech5
It's going to be simultaneously launched on the PC, the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and believe it or not, the Mac.
Yeah, originally when they were showing off the Tech 5 demo, or Tech 5, I guess it was a demonstration of it, they were actually showing off bits of Rage, and it's kind of got a little bit of driving in there.
There's a bit of first-person shooter stuff in there as well, so it's kind of like Motorstorm meets Quake.
In fact, here's a quote from Todd Hallenscheid, the CEO of ID Software.
It's more than just a first-person shooter.
We will show vehicles and racetracks, driving and racing elements.
It is an action-oriented game, but with a lot of adventure elements.
It will be story-driven, but you can also choose your own route to go through things.
Hmm.
As long as it's better than Quake 4, because Quake 4 held my interest for about three seconds and I was like, eh, not interested.
Yeah, well hopefully this will hold your interest for a little bit longer than that.
Quake Arena is headed to Xbox Live Arcade.
Now this is something we...
I was thinking, is this like the...
Old school version of Quake, but just adapted for Xbox Live.
It might be, I don't know.
Will it have the original Nine Inch Nails soundtrack and all that?
I don't think so.
I'll be sad.
I have fond memories of Quake.
This was back in the day when broadband you could only find in colleges.
Broadband was not really sold for commercial use.
My friends went to college in the Bay Area and I used to call in, dial up to their broadband connection and we would play Quake.
About three of them in the dorms and then me on dial up.
We'd stay up all night long playing Quake.
It was awesome.
You couldn't do that with Duke Nukem Forever for some reason.
I don't know.
Because it never came out.
Perhaps this is another game people will stay up all night playing, though.
I don't know.
It's a game called Quake Zero.
I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's probably Quake 3 Arena coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
Actually, it's different.
Quake Zero is going to cost zero.
That's why it's called Quake Zero.
It's free.
I understand that, but the port of Quake 3 Arena... Oh, so the Quake Arena game... That would be awesome.
Quake 3 is my favorite.
Well, there you go.
Oh, that would be great.
Well, anyway, Quake Zero is going to be a web-based version of Quake 3 multiplayer.
So you can just fire up your web browser and play.
Has the source code been out for Quake 3?
I can't remember.
Well, it doesn't matter because it's being developed in-house anyway, so they have it.
But they're going to be putting it out there, and I guess it's going to be ad-supported.
It's going to have some in-game advertising.
That's how it's really going to be $0.
but free is good.
I would love to see Quake and I'm playing it and then there's a McDonald's ad or something.
That would make it totally realistic.
DarkTetsuya says LOL Quake Zero.
Zero calories, zero sugar.
I guess, you know, from all that sitting.
More caffeine, exactly.
NintendoManiac64 said I wonder if Quake Zero will be anything like Phosphor when it runs on Shockwave.
RossDLUT says, yeah, ID released the source code ages ago.
I thought I remember reading something about that.
Now, if only Quake Zero were compatible with the Wii web browser, which I honestly doubt it would be, but we can hope.
One thing that will be compatible, though, they announced Unreal Tournament 3, which is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 later this year.
It's going to be supporting keyboard and mouse.
So that's kind of cool.
I know a lot of people really love keyboard and mouse, especially playing PC first-person shooters.
So now you can actually do that on the console and kind of have a fair shake at people playing on PC.
Or as people playing on PC.
That's kind of cool because that will put that whole debate to rest finally.
People can take it out.
What is better, the controller or the keyboard and mouse?
People can finally duke it out.
The other thing, I mean, Unreal Tournament 3 for the PS3 is actually kind of shaping up more like a PC game.
I mean, obviously it is a PC game as well, but with the fact that you can download mods for it.
That is pretty awesome.
I've got to hand it to PlayStation 3 for that.
It's going to be sweet.
We will see.
RavensDolphin in chat says, Bluetooth mouse and keyboard for the win.
Tigerclaw said, Unreal Tournament 3 players with keyboard and mouse will pwn the UT3 players with the 6-axis.
Well, it's not like the keyboard and mouse are going to vibrate either.
So, you got that.
Also, some other news coming out of QuakeCon.
Is this coming out of QuakeCon or is this just about the same time?
It's about the same time.
It might be out of QuakeCon.
Well, we'll see here.
Actually, this story is coming from Ain't It Cool News, which is kind of interesting.
Roger Avery is working on an adaptation of
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I think so.
I think so.
Didn't he?
I don't know, but I know he's not doing it again.
I know he was tied to it.
Oh yeah, we talked about that a couple weeks ago.
Well, I'm talking about it now, so continue your story.
We'll see World War... According to Ain't It Cool News, they expect we'll see World War II crazy tongue-in-cheek horror sci-fi action.
I wonder if you'll get like Hitler in the big mech like you fought in the game.
That would be kind of strange.
It sounds perfect for Uwe Boll, though.
Oh, I forgot to mention that earlier.
I interviewed Uwe Boll this week.
What the hell?
How did you not mention this?
People turned the show off ten minutes ago with all the WoW talk.
I forgot.
You met Uwe Boll?
I didn't meet him.
I interviewed him over the phone, though.
Oh, okay.
But not for this show.
No, not for this show.
I interviewed him for my work.
All right.
Well, what happened?
Okay, well, here's the thing.
I had to watch his movie BloodRayne 2 Deliverance, and it's horrible.
Vampire Western Vampire Western Vampire Western
Now, obviously the interview was tame because it was for a magazine, so we had to be positive about the whole thing.
But we did ask him about the boxing stuff.
That was kind of funny.
I actually have the whole interview transcribed on the Orange Lounge live journal community.
So if you want to check it out there, you can see everything we talked about.
We also talked about there's a new...
movie he's doing called Tunnel Rats that's being made into a game at the same time.
So that's kind of an interesting thing.
And then, of course, Postal's coming out this year, so...
They had a lot of advertisement at Comic Con for Postal.
It was weird.
But, um, I don't know But, okay, interesting is a very, like, broad word Because, like, you could know a guy that, like, picks his nose and eats it And you could go, that's really interesting I kind of felt bad for him a little bit Because he's not trying to make awesome movies He's just trying to make genre flicks And he just happens to use video games to kind of supplement that To get more of an audience I don't know
He's kind of a low, underachiever, I guess.
Who wakes, who gets out of bed in the morning and goes, I want to make a vampire western?
Film students?
I guess so.
I think we should make Orange Lounge Radio the movie, and it should be a vampire western.
Okay, the movie itself, I knew it was bad, like, within the first two minutes.
I watched the whole movie and fast-forwarded, because I couldn't stand it.
Luckily, though, I got to hear most of the dialogue, because it was really slow.
The only bad thing about it, there was no nudity.
That kind of sucked.
But, Zach Ward, the guy that plays the main character in the Postal movie, he played Billy the Kid, the vampire.
And I kind of liked him in that.
I thought he was a good vampire.
Because, and here's why he was a good vampire, he would hurt innocent people without a thought.
You know, like, for example, the very end of the movie, she's going to rescue these kids because he's going to bite them all and turn them and, you know...
I don't know, make himself more immortal or something.
And she walks in and this trap springs and basically all the kids get hung.
Awesome!
And so she's pushing this counterweight back so that the kids don't die.
But unfortunately one of the little kids dies.
And so there's stuff like that throughout the whole movie.
And they're not afraid to hurt innocent little children in the movie.
I can respect that.
So...
I don't know.
Wow.
Kill children, earn points for Loki.
Actually, I gotta say real quick is that Robert M has the, in our chat room at chatonorangeloungeradio.com, has the first piece of casting news for Orange Lounge Radio, the new vampire western movie.
Loki has been cast to play Tingle.
Amazing.
There is no Tingle in this movie.
But where will we get our rupees?
Anyways, moving on to something completely opposite of that.
Lego Indiana Jones was announced at Comic Con because there aren't enough Lego franchises yet and they're going to milk that for every penny that they can.
But Lego games aren't that bad.
I can think of worse games.
I can think of far worse games.
They aren't that bad.
So following Lego Batman this year, you're going to be seeing Lego Indiana Jones next year.
And I want Lego Batman, by the way.
That'll be pretty cool.
Well, it's a pity that Jamie isn't here because she would probably be running circles around this story.
I'm very happy about this one.
Apparently, there is a Doctor Who video game that could be on its way for Christmas.
Top Trumps has revealed they plan for a Doctor Who video game to be released in time for Christmas 2007.
It's thought to be available on the PC, PlayStation 2, DS, and mobile games.
Apparently, an advertisement for the game appears in the new Doctor Who Top Trumps card pack.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
This is good news and bad news.
The good news is it's a Doctor Who video game.
The bad news is it's a Doctor Who video game because video games that are based off of TV shows and stuff usually don't go too well.
That's true, but remember they announced that Battlestar game for Xbox Live Arcade a while back?
It came out last week, I think.
Did it actually come out?
Oh, Battlestar.
I'm sorry, I'm thinking Wing Commander.
Oh, no.
Battlestar, I know it's on PartnerNet and my friends that work at
EA have been playing it and they actually said it's a pretty fun game even though like they're hardcore fans and it really is like a typical space shooter with Battlestar just plastered on it nothing really Battlestar related beyond that so you get occasional gems and I hope to goodness that the Heroes game that Ubisoft is doing is going to be good so I mean there's no need to really worry about games that come from TV shows I think
I guess that's a little bit more encouraging there.
Well, there is another interesting rumor that's come out recently.
And this is one that has me extremely excited.
Apparently, EGM has run their rumor mill story from Quarterman.
He does this every month.
And the rumor is that apparently they were, I believe, level 5.
They developed some RPGs and stuff.
Oh, actually, no, they weren't the ones that developed this.
My mistake.
Anyways, Bionic Commando.
It was originally going to be made into a PlayStation Network game.
However, they decided that they're just going to make it into a full-fledged game instead.
So, possibly a Bionic Commando game soon.
That would be all kinds of rad, because that's like an old series that a lot of people would like to see get brought back.
I'd be very happy about that.
As long as they don't, like...
turn it into a completely different game.
You know what I mean?
Like, try to keep some of the elements that made the first one fun.
Like, I would not want to see Bionic Commando go 3D.
That would not be fun for me.
But, I don't know.
It would probably, if they did it, like, if it was as good as the Rygar game, you know, when they updated that, I mean, that wasn't too bad, I think.
But...
Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom, chat.orangelandre.com says, Dear Capcom, Wii version.
K, thanks.
That could be interesting.
I don't know, we'll see.
NASCAR 06, FIFA World Cup 06, all those are shutting down.
And I guess the thought is that most of you will have upgraded to 08 by that point, if not at least 07.
But I haven't upgraded from Madden 06.
Why do you own Madden 06?
Don't you mean you haven't upgraded from Madden 99?
That is so not your kind of game, I thought.
It's not.
Is it achievement points?
No.
You're a whore.
You're a whore for achievement points.
Some other games that are getting shut down, though.
I got it for free.
Surprisingly, November 1st of 07, Burnout Revenge on Xbox and PlayStation 2.
So they're shutting off one of the Burnout titles, and the Need for Speed Underground and Most Wanted also getting the plug pulled on them, November 1st of 07.
Well, Underground's damn old, and Revenge, technically, on... Well, the Xbox is the latest one, but PlayStation, I mean, they had Dominator, so...
Oh well.
Well, if you're one of the five people that plays these games online still, then you're probably pretty angsty, so we dedicate the FUs of the Week just for you.
Now, usually we would have music here, but since we're in our temper, thank you.
Hey, that's the music.
We can find music.
It's too late now, we're live, remember?
Alright, so there we go, there's your music, and it's the FUs of the Week time, so Loki, start us off tonight.
my FU of the week goes to Genki for just porting the Playstation 2 version of Wengen Midnight to the Playstation 3 I mean, come on, spend a little bit more time hell, that fucking lame-ass game Import Tuner Challenge that came out on the Xbox 360 looked better than this that's sad and maybe some better music in it too because that's kind of sad too
Yeah, music like that!
My next FU goes to Shane for not shutting his cell phone off during the recording of the show.
I don't know what you're talking about.
My other FU goes to Comcast for making me suffer without internet until Tuesday, and also to whichever mystery neighbor I'm stealing Wi-Fi from for not being strong enough.
Although, I will give it this, like yesterday, the strength of the Wi-Fi was perfect, and I was able to download Torrents of Big Brother to get all caught up on Big Brother 8.
So...
and Jen Sucks, just for the record.
Shane, do you have any FUs of the Wii?
I could come up with one real quick.
FU to Blizzard for not giving me the expansion for free or telling me when it's going to come out because I really want it and it's really all I've been reading about since they announced it.
Me and the internet, that's all we do is just talk about the WoW expansion.
Alright.
Let's get back into some news.
Anyways, another cool game that's going to be heading our way pretty soon.
Crysis has been announced to be released on November 16th.
And that game looks damn good.
And I really want to build a PC for it.
Tell us a little more about this game.
I don't know much about it.
Crysis is the next game in the series of, I guess, Far Cry.
Even though there is Far Cry 2.
That's right, I've heard of this.
But it's just... I mean, the original Far Cry game was pretty good looking.
This one now is just...
Thanks for watching!
BoxArt right there looks like it's crazy, like 2,000 years in the future.
It's in the future, I'm assuming.
Basically, it's still on a tropical island type thing.
Aliens have either crash-landed in one section of the map, and so you have this whole section that's kind of zero-G and frozen, so it's interesting stuff there.
Plus, the whole suit that you have is like a nano-suit that you can upgrade to,
You can switch it to speed, so all your powers and your speed, and you can move around really fast, or armor, or stealth, and stuff like that.
Really cool looking.
That could be interesting.
Well, this is also interesting, and that is SingStar is continuing to do a lot of business and coming out with new games.
I guess this is mostly in Europe, though.
I have not heard of SingStar really taking off in this country.
There's another one coming out this month, actually.
My gosh.
SingStar amped in the U.S.
Maybe they are doing really well there.
And I think this is coming out in the U.S.
as well.
This is SingStar Anthems.
And it's actually, I gotta hand it to them.
This is actually a pretty kick-ass song list.
If you like your power ballads and your anthems, this is a pretty kick-ass song list.
Anastasia, Left Outside Alone.
I actually like that song.
Probably no one else has heard of it.
Avril Lavigne, I'm With You.
Cyndi Lauper, Time After Time.
You DDR fans, the original version of Ordinary World by Duran Duran is in this.
Alone by Heart.
That's a hell of a power ballad.
Two songs by Mr. Mister.
That's awesome.
You get broken wings.
And Queen, the show must go on.
Rock Set, a couple Rock Set songs in there.
What are Rock Set songs?
It must have been Love, of course.
But what's the other one?
Listen to Your Heart.
Oh.
I wanted Joyride.
I don't care.
That's not a power ballad.
It's the ultimate.
The ultimate power ballad, Meatloaf.
I'd do anything for love, but I wouldn't do that.
That is all kinds of awesome.
But I do agree with what Joystick said when they reported on this, and that would be, this game is shit without journey.
How can you have a ballads game and have no journey?
Where's my Don't Stop Believin'?
Is that on the Sony label?
Is it on the Sony label?
Because that's all they get are songs from the label.
Probably not, then.
I'm surprised Open Arms isn't on there.
I know!
How can you pay whatever it takes to get Open Arms in this game?
Or Don't Stop Believin'?
Sony can't afford to buy things right now.
They're all poor with the PS3 stuff.
Oh, whatever.
But if they want this game to take off, they will invest the money in it.
I'm curious to see what Chad says about this.
Uh...
Oh, no, they're still commenting on Crysis.
RossDLUT says, ooh, Crysis, a generic first-person shooter game with an extra graphical effort.
It's not that generic.
It looks pretty awesome.
Whatever.
SonOfDad says, karaoke in the U.S.
only belongs in bars.
Yeah, but what if you have a bar at home?
Like, you have a bunch of liquor at home.
That's acceptable, right?
That's false, because a lot of people I know love playing the karaoke games at parties and stuff.
It's really fun to do.
Robert M. suggests Foreigner, Poison.
Son of Dad also says he wants the final countdown.
Yes!
That'd be awesome.
I just got 2DX4thStyle finally, and I love that song so much.
Is that part of the Konami liquidation?
Yes.
Sale?
Brand new 2DX4thStyle.
The five-finger sale at Konami.
Whatever, it was free.
You know, I found something the other day, actually.
What?
I found it today.
I have a DDR Club append.
I don't even know where the hell that came from.
How random.
It might be mine.
I used to have both those games.
Maybe.
You probably have it from when we used to live together years ago.
No, I think Jamie gave it to me.
She gave you a Club of Pen?
I think those things are actually worth kind of money.
No, I doubt it.
Those are the DDR games nobody fucking played.
Who played Club of Pen?
I did.
I can't play it anyways because I don't have second mix, so it's completely useless to me.
It did have a lot of crap on it, though.
Let's talk about release dates, shall we?
And we'll travel to Europe first, even though Jamie's not here tonight.
I've got her back, and it's really not a long list this week.
On August 10th, over in Europe, you guys are getting Pac-Man Rally on the PSP.
The Game Named After Loki
You're ruining all the future release date list.
Jamie's going to be so angry.
I feel bad because there's only one freaking release this week, so I'm trying to give them something to look forward to because I don't think Europe is filled with Pac-Man Rally fans.
If it was, this is a huge release for them.
If I'm wrong, Europe folks, please send us an email, mailbag at orangeonline3.com and please tell us how much you love Pac-Man Rally and how you're going to be camping outside.
Send us your pictures from camping outside game.
I want to go camping.
Hey, you want to hear something?
You want to hear something about the stupid rally games that they have in Europe?
We keep getting fucking some, was it SVG or something?
One of these smaller distributors out there keeps publishing this European crap that comes over here.
For example, they have Crazy Frog Racer.
Because, ooh, we really need a game based off that annoying piece of shit.
Then there's this Kokoto Racer thing, which is like some little devil looking thing.
I don't know.
Too many kart racing games in Europe.
However, though, in the U.S., there's not a whole lot coming out this week, but there is a lot more than in the U.K.
For example, on PSP, we've got Crazy Taxi Fair Wars, also Tomb Raider Anniversary.
That's going to be coming out.
On the DS, you've got Mega Man, Star Force Pegasus, and Star Force Leo.
And if you're buying through GameStop, Star Force Dragon.
Also, we've got Glory Days 2, which is supposed to be a pretty good kind of a side-scroller strategy game.
On the Wii, Boogie is going to be coming out.
It's kind of a singing and karaoke game, or dancing and karaoke game.
PlayStation 3, nothing, although I do believe that Splinter Cell Double Agent I thought was coming out this week.
I don't know.
And then...
on PC.
Aw, no Tycoon game this week.
That's a first.
Damn.
You know, I was really hoping... Pac-Man Rally Tycoon is coming out on the PC.
Go figure.
No, there's Attack on Pearl Harbor, so that's kind of cool.
And, uh...
I don't know.
Start of Ender 3.
Woohoo.
Alright, well, coming out in Japan.
Japan's also kind of having a bit of a slow week when it comes to game releases, but they do have one big one that a lot of folks are looking forward to.
On the PlayStation 2, Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System is coming out this week.
The dumbest name for a game.
It's basically the International Zodiac Job System.
It's the international version.
Yeah, the international version that doesn't go anywhere but Japan.
It doesn't get released anywhere else.
I know, but there'll be people importing it.
I believe it's just the voiceovers.
You can select English options.
I don't think the text is English.
Oh, because that'd be awesome if it was in English because then you can import it.
Well, most of the other international versions is what people did.
Like Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix, just for chains of memories on PS2.
But the text wasn't English, I thought.
I thought it was just the voices.
I'm not sure, to be honest, because I already have Final Fantasy XII and I could care less about new systems.
But you get to do new international Zodiac jobs.
Yippee.
Whatever that means.
I think it meant that you're supposed to cater your characters to more like one classic class.
Like one of them is more like a red mage and the other one is more like a black mage.
They had new classes too or something.
Funny languages because it wasn't English.
Also coming out, which we should note, on the DS, the DS has a little bit more releases.
Of course, there's another Yu-Gi-Oh!
game coming out, Yu-Gi-Oh!
Dual Monsters GX.
And also coming out, we should say, on Nintendo's DS from Nintendo, Donkey Kong Jungle Climber, or the King of Swing, is coming out in Japan as well.
King of Swing 2, basically.
And looking at SP...
Hey, there's a professional Atlas travel guide.
That would be the most fun game ever.
I want to look up where Rome is at.
Wild Arms XF or Wild Arms Crossfire.
You can also look forward to that.
It's not as cool as Dust Cap 2.
I know.
Not as cool as Dust Cap 2.
Definitely.
Well, that's it.
That's all the release dates I'm going to care to name this week.
Well, one upcoming release that we're going to get some more information about at Tokyo Game Show this year is Metal Gear Solid 4, where it's rumored that the game will actually have a release date announced.
Although, we're probably guessing March right now.
So, we just had a story about naming a date where they're going to name a release date.
Damn it!
I did it again!
I thought we said no more of these stories about naming a date where they're going to have a date.
This is so stupid.
I'm sorry.
Why do people get excited about this?
No, it's okay.
Fired!
No, we can't fire Loki.
Or else where else would we record this week?
We'd be screwed.
Yeah.
Alright.
Some other things to note really quickly.
Some releases coming out in Europe.
Super Paper Mario is finally coming out in Europe on September 14th, speaking of dates.
Can you believe it?
It's coming out for £35 in Europe.
And, uh...
Pac-Man Rally Pac-Man Rally
Wait for Paper Mario.
I guess.
Okay, I guess you can get 35 pounds that way.
Now what is much more important that is on the Nintendo DS on September 14th over in Europe is...
Freshly picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland is finally coming out.
Loki, will you be importing it?
Because the great news is the DS is region free, even though there's no plans to release this game in the US yet, you can actually import this game still for probably about, I think I saw it listed somewhere for about 45 bucks if you want to get Tingle.
A waste of $45?
Why not?
Why won't you buy this game, Matt?
Why the hate for Tingle?
Because I don't like Tingle.
I think Tingle's a stupid character.
I didn't like him in Wind Waker.
Why the hell would I like him...
Now that he has his own game.
I wonder if the game is any good.
I haven't heard anything about it.
I don't think he's going to be in fucking Smash Bros.
Brawl.
As a playable character?
I'll never hear the fucking end of it.
Tingle's in fucking Smash Bros.
Check it out.
I don't think he'll be in it.
I don't think he'll be in it.
It's because I did his voice once.
And ever since then, it's just never ending.
Never ending.
it would be really weird to have him in it though because they're using all the Zelda things oh, do Tingle's voice, that'd be awesome they're using the Zelda things from Twilight Princess and even though I didn't beat the game I never saw Tingle there, so yeah, but he was in Wind Waker and I think he was in one of the Nintendo 64 ones he was in that crappy one, Majora's Mask but they've already covered Wind Waker and all that stuff, I thought but if they're giving him his own game they also fucking took Balloon Fight and made his own version of that, come on
It's quirky and weird in Japanese.
I hate the Japanese.
GS68 is in chat and says, Tingle as the Super Smash Bros.
Brawl character, will Loki get shot?
Wonderdog Harold has a suggestion.
Loki should just say he likes Tingle and then no one would bring up Tingle ever again.
I don't like Tingle though, that's the thing.
Alright.
And Shane is going to read tonight's mailbag.
Totally!
That should be interesting to say the least.
Watch out, because I might make fun of you.
Alright, so we'll be back in just a moment with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
