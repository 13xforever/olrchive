Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Wokey!

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, August 26, 2007, new Castlevania games are being made for an unlikely platform,

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Sony confirms a video recorder for the PlayStation 3,

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
and a much anticipated 360 game gets pushed back to December.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
We are that video game podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
My name is Rob Roberts. Joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
My head is numb.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Who doesn't have a microphone on tonight?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
I do now.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
There you go. How are you doing?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Hey, I have a head injury, so leave me alone.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm sorry to hear. What happened to your head?

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
I was getting out of the car and then I was getting back into the car and my foot slipped out from under me.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I see.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
On the gravel outside and I hit my head on the top of my Lancer.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Aw, sorry to hear it.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Metal hurts when it hits you in the head.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yes.

01:08.000 --> 01:16.000
It was like one moment I'm upright, the next moment I actually have my head laying on the seat of the driver's side of my car.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Do you think that the great people up in the sky were trying to tell you something?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I have a concussion, Rob.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Sorry to hear it.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Well, this should make for a riveting tonight's show, so we'll see.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
All right, also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Hello.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Hi, Loki. How are you doing?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Doing good.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Excellent.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
All right, well, let's get into how we like to start the show off always with a little bit of how is your gaming week.

01:38.000 --> 01:46.000
If you want to join along and participate in the program, though, head on over to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and you can participate in tonight's program.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
Meanwhile, let's start it off.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
I played a bunch of Final Fantasy VI in the car and then didn't save it.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
That's not good.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
On a Game Boy Micro, I was extra motion sick for the entire time. It was fantastic.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
And then I got like 2 million, I'm sorry, 2 billion on a World Cup soccer the other day. I was pretty happy.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Pinball?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Yes, pinball.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Pinball fun?

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
Well, hi, they just take up space. I have no choice but to play them.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
What's more fun, pinball or Final Fantasy?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Pinball.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
All right, just curious.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I would sell Final Fantasy Pinball if that existed.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Dude, that would be beautiful.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
They should make a Final Fantasy Pinball.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
But pinball is instant gratification because it goes banging. It makes noises.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
And I actually...

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
It's banging.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Dan took the glass off of our Twilight Zone, so I put the camera in and took pictures from inside the machine.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
You know what else would be cool with pinball machines? A laser light show, if they could do that, too.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
Tonight's show is very broken. I'll explain why in a minute. I'm trying to multitask in a lot of different ways.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Anything else you want to share with your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
I don't like concussions. They should make concussion the game.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
How exactly does that work? How would concussion the game?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
You just go around hitting people in the head.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
And the worse of a head injury you give them without killing them, the better you score.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
All right, well, let's go over to Loki and check in with you. How was your gaming week?

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
My gaming week was good. Not quite as extensive as last week, but still good.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Let's see, of course, being that Bioshock came out, of course they played tons of that.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
And I haven't really gotten too far in it yet.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
I actually restarted the game once because I realized...

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
I'm trying to streamline my achievement getting there.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And I realized there was an achievement for not killing any of the little sisters.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
So, unfortunately, I rescued the first little sister and then killed the second one because I wanted to see what happened.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
What happened was...

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
You just want to see what happens when you kill little girls.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
What happened was that I was unable to get an achievement, so I need to restart the game, so now I'm doing that again.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
I love how you'll go back and play the whole game over just because you missed an achievement.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Oh, hell yeah. Well, I don't want to have to play the whole game over again.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
And I wasn't that far to begin with, so now I'm just going back and doing what I did.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
And then, of course, I played the Silent Hill Origins demo that magically got leaked out there.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
So, I played that on the PSP, and I gotta say, man, between what we saw originally, like the Konami BBQ,

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
to what it is now, completely different game.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
I mean, this game looks friggin' awesome.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
It's just... I don't know, it looks actually better than some of the PlayStation 2 versions.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
So, definitely one to pick up on the PSP.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
And, let's see, other than that, I actually played a little bit of Saints Row.

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
We finally got our entire game room up at work, and we did a five-player Saints Row deathmatch on that.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
It looks sweet, the setup we have, and hopefully I'll have some pictures soon.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
What exactly does your game room at work consist of?

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
The game room at work consists of five Xbox 360s, and there's LCD monitors for each one of those.

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
And then, four of those are tied into a 37-inch LCD TV that we have mounted to the wall.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
So, if you really wanted to, you can actually tune in on the TV, four different monitors,

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
and see what other people are, you know, their perspective.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
So, if someone's watching us play, they don't have to look over our shoulders,

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
they can actually dial it in and see what other people are doing.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Or, you know, you can just play it on the TV if you're only doing one person on there or something.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
So, other cool things we talked about doing with that is actually like Project Gotham Racing,

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
where you could do four people actually racing each other,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
and then the fifth one would be on the big screen,

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
and that would be kind of one of the spectator mode options there,

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
so that way everyone's racing and you see like kind of a racetrack view of the whole game.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
So, that would be pretty slick.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
But, it's basically for the event that we've got coming this coming week,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
with our publishers coming out and stuff.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.000
And also, really it's for Grand Theft Auto IV, because we're that obsessed with Grand Theft Auto.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
Too bad you got all that set up, and now you're going to have to wait until next year, though.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
That's okay. We've got Saints Row in the meantime,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
and we're going to beg the publishers to give us copies,

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
multiple copies of upcoming games that would possibly be something we'd want to play.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
All right, well, let me get some comments here from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchrader.com.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I'm looking at rawstealut says,

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Not killing any of the Little Sisters is how you get the best ending, too.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
And then undeadzerglings asks, Achievement Whore?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Yes, Loki's an Achievement Whore.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
He will buy games just to get the achievement points out of them.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Not necessarily. I don't really do that anymore.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
I will play games that are crappy for your achievements sometimes.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Out of the last few Xbox Live Arcade releases,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
how many would you say you bought strictly to get the achievement points out of them?

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
None of the recent ones, because I've kind of got a little bit smarter on that.

06:57.000 --> 07:05.000
But let's see, previous ones that I bought for achievements, Pac-Man, Frogger.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Shit, what else did I buy?

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
I don't know, there's quite a few games that I bought on kind of like an impulse buy.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
Luckily now I've gotten it where I don't buy games straight out right.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I will play the demo first, except for Catan.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
Catan had to download the full thing, but I knew what that was before I played it.

07:26.000 --> 07:33.000
But yeah, now I strictly play the demos first, and then if I like it, I'll buy it.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
SHA100Matt in our chat says, so Loki is more of a high-priced whore now.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Exactly.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
My gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
I, unlike most of America, did not run out and buy Bioshock right away.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
Because I'm kind of holding out to see if some used copies or a price cut shows up.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Plus I'm going to be in LA most of next week.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
I would say, well locally you can buy it at Fry's for $49.99.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Really? See, that's what I'm holding out for, some deals like that.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
I heard Circuit City was doing some type of sale too.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
That's the other thing too I was going to say.

08:02.000 --> 08:09.000
I bought the limited edition, and I'm sure everyone read on the internet that they've had some problems with the figurines breaking.

08:09.000 --> 08:17.000
And I was so lucky that I went into GameStop, and there's a big fucking post-it note on mine that says broken figurine.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
And they're looking at it, and they're looking at me and kind of thinking in their heads, how are we going to get this guy to take it?

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
So they're all, yeah, this is the last one, and the figurine's broken.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.000
I don't know what to do to fix it, so I needed to go to some website.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
I'm like, well do you have the website that I'm supposed to go to?

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Well I don't know what it is, let me check my email.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Finally they got it for me.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
But you know, to be honest, I opened the thing up, took some super glue to it, you can't even tell it broke.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
So I don't care, I don't want the fucking art book.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
You can download it for free, I don't need that thing.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
But the other thing about the limited edition, if you are, I don't know if you can still buy them now,

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
but if you are thinking about buying one, let me put it this way, the remix CD that they have on there with three tracks,

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
they're remixed by Moby, they suck really bad.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
They are some of the worst remixes I have ever heard.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.000
I mean, it is just, I would be embarrassed if I was Moby and releasing that shit.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
It was awful.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Moby did a whole album of awful though.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
I haven't watched the behind the scenes DVD or anything like that, so I can't really judge that.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
But that, I popped in that music CD last time, like ooh, remixes, I'm going to check it out.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
No, it was crap.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Awful, awful, awful crap.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
But the game is awesome though, so it doesn't matter.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
I just wanted the figurine for my desk.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Didn't give a shit about the extra CD.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Alright, well let's see, what did I do for My Gaming Week?

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
My Gaming Week, oh gosh, I didn't do a whole lot of new stuff.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
I did play some of the new offerings on Xbox Live Arcade, like Space Giraffe.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Space Giraffe is interesting because it tries to assert itself that it's not Tempest,

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
although it kind of is Tempest to me.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
But here's the thing, and I love Tempest,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
Tempest 2000 is one of my favorite games of all times.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Space Giraffe is really hard to see.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
The colors that they chose to use in this game, the purples and the yellows,

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
they all blend together and it's really hard to make out what the hell is going on in this game.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Unlike the old school Tempest, where the web was blue,

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
the enemies were red, your bullets were green,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
it was really easy to see everything kind of stick out,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
and not so easy in this one.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
I wasn't big on the visuals in Space Giraffe,

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
although I did think some of the jokes were really funny.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
There's pictures in the background,

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
and when you get the pods that let you jump off the web,

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
it will say, Pod Get, and all these interesting things.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
That's fantastic.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
It's kind of funny.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
It's obvious that the developers obviously love themselves some games,

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
but I don't know.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
The visuals really take a lot away from the game for me.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
So that's really it.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Other than that, I've just been trekking along as usual on World of Warcraft.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I'm looking forward to playing Overlord,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
because I just got a copy of that,

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
so I'm going to be checking out Overlord this week.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
So we'll see how that goes.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
It's awesome.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
I would be still playing it if Bioshock didn't come out.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
It's just stupid fun.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
I mean, it's one of those games that they try to convince you

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
that doing the right thing is going to benefit you in some way,

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
and then just unfortunately the AI just really pisses you off,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
and you're just like, fuck it, I'm going to kill you all now.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
And then you realize, hey, helping them out actually didn't do anything for me,

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
so I'm just going to kill them all.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
All right.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
That's pretty much it for my Game of the Week.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
I don't have a lot else to share, so what else do we get into now?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I guess we can move on to some housekeeping.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
So housekeeping.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
First off, we are going to be incorporating video into the show real soon,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
and that's why you've heard me kind of messing around a little bit

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
during the pre-show there, and I am somewhat distracted,

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
because on the laptop I'm playing with this site we're going to be using

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
to stream our video, operator11.com,

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
which if you guys are familiar with All Games All Games Interactive,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
it's the website they use,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
they've been encouraging some of the other shows on the network to start using it.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Although I do want to make clear, we're not turning into a TV show,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
and we're not going to be using video too heavily.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
We just want you guys to be able to see us as we broadcast the show if you want.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I don't know why people would want to see that.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
And we're not going to be using the, was it the...

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
You can call us with your webcam and all that stuff?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Well, that...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Hey, playing porn on the webcam,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
that was something that we did back at the old apartment,

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
a couple studios ago, when we used to play Gals Panic over the webcam.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Yeah, no, we're not going to be turning into a TV show suddenly,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
it's just like a little something extra.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
And the funny thing is, I was streaming the first part of the show,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
but this is how fickle it is and how broken it is,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I was actually streaming the first few moments of the show,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
and then I accidentally clicked the wrong link, and now it's gone.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Like, I accidentally refreshed the page and screwed everything up.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
So I'm going to have to start over again later or something, I don't know.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
So I'm still trying to get used to this program.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
So maybe we'll stream part B, I don't know.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
But it's off now, it was going.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
But in the channel, there's some video of me playing Super Metroid earlier,

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
but the audio is all screwed up.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I really don't encourage you to visit it.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It's not worth your time.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
We're trying, though.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
We've heard a lot of folks, especially the folks that listen to us live on Sunday night,

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
want to see video, so we're trying to add that into the show,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
but we're not going to go TV all of a sudden.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Why would you want to see video?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
I don't know.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
We don't do anything.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
We don't really do anything.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
I don't know what you think this is.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Are they under the impression that there's an actual lounge in here,

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
that we're all kicking back with martinis or something, you know?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Just shooting the shit.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
I mean, we're just sitting in a small room.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
I think it has potential maybe later on if we want to shoot video

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
at whatever tournaments we end up at or shows we end up at.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
We can put that in the show and interviews we do as well,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
and then the video users can see video,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
but the audio users don't have anything taken away from them.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
You know what I mean?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
So I just want to see how we can enhance with video.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
But that's a long time coming.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
We'll see.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
If you have ideas, e-mail us, mailbag at orangelandrader.com,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
and I, of course, will be talking to some of the folks

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
that already use Op 11 and see what they think.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
But I don't want to go crazy with a TV show,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
and Dark Soccer doesn't like TV either,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
so I know she's not a big fan of the television.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
Especially with Scott's public access green screen,

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
his little test thing.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I'd laugh.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
I was just like, oh, my God, dude.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Good times.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
All right.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Well, anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with some gaming news?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
It's so incredibly cheesy.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Anyways, no, gaming news.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
So this week, a little interesting.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
We're going to start things off, of course,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
talking about a very interesting development out of Leipzig,

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
and that would be the new track and field game on the DS.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
It's, I guess, the 25th anniversary of track and field,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
and as you remember last week,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I could care less about the Xbox Live Arcade game,

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
but now there's the new international track and field game,

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
which is going to feature 20 different athletic events,

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
and I guess there was going to be some unlockable Konami characters to play,

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
including they've got Sparkster from Rocket Knight Adventures

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
and Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
which, to be honest, I think Pyramid Head would win

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
because he'd just butcher everybody else,

15:17.000 --> 15:24.000
but I wonder if raping people is one of the events in there

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
because he only rapes monsters.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Pyramid Head being in the game is all kinds of awesome, though,

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
you have to admit.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
That's pretty rad.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Anyway, later in the program, during part B,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
we'll be talking about characters we would like to see

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
in this track and field game in a segment we call Listless,

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
but we'll get into that a little later in the program.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
They didn't say anything else about the events

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
or any additional, like, how the game will play.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Is it going to be button mashing again?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
That's what I want to know.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Well, I'm assuming since it's on the DS,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
it's probably going to have something to do with the stylus,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
but they didn't really say anything other than

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
there will be four player matches via,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
they said locally or via Wi-Fi.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
I'm assuming Wi-Fi ad hoc and Wi-Fi infrastructure.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Downloadable content and online rankings, leaderboards,

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
and detailed player profiles.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
So that's kind of cool that they're going to do leaderboards

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
and that kind of thing.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
And I guess a ticker to include, like, a news feed.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
It says promise to update anyone playing online

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
whenever a world record is broken.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Oh great, so playing the new track and field is going to be like watching CNN.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
You're going to have to try and watch what's going on in this box,

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
and you've got the ticker down here,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
and then you've got the stock report over here,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
or, I'm sorry, the people that are online over here.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
How did they cram all that on a DS screen?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
It looks cool.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
I'm surprised they didn't do, like, a Wii version to go along with that, you know.

16:45.000 --> 16:51.000
Alright, looking at chat here and what's going on there,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
your nickname says,

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
Memo to Konami, use the fucking DDR pad for track and field.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
Undead Zurgling says, I think Pyramid Head only rapes dolls.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
No, he rapes the nurses too.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
Escapist says, just what the world needed, more track and field.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
Nintendo Maniac 64 said, Pyramid Head's in track and field? Dude!

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
And then going back to the webcam chat we had just before the show started there,

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
let's see, we had Jaded says,

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
I think it would be funny seeing Loki kick everyone's ass during one of his fits about Max.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
Kropotkin says, I mean, seeing people's faces stresses what people are thinking and saying.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Dark Knight says, remember Rob did TV before.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
That was, like, ten years ago. I wouldn't even count that.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I'm an old man now.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
My young, fresh television face is long gone.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Alright, let's...

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Now it's kind of moldy.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Yes, it is getting a little moldy and wrinkly.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Alright, but you'll be able to see it in all its glory in Op11.com pretty soon.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
As soon as I figure out how to get through an entire segment without screwing it up and deleting all the video.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
That'll be wonderful.

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
I did want to say that for anyone who actually watches Deviant, who's on DeviantArt,

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
UdonKru did the cover art for the track and field game.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
So you can actually check out their DeviantArt page for some of the work they did on it.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
And some of those chibi characters were really cute.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Like, chibi Pyramid Head is still a winner.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I do have to agree with Shane, though.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
They used the movie P-Hitty.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
They didn't use the P-Hitty that you love and adore?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
No, not the one with the unwieldy, gigantic head.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Sorry to hear it.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Well, moving on to other DS releases that will be upcoming very soon.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Final Fantasy IV has gotten some coverage in Famitsu Magazine.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
And you can get your hands on some of the latest scans there from Famitsu Magazine.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
They're all around the web.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
And boy, this game looks pretty hot.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
I mean, imagine, again, Final Fantasy IV, but in Final Fantasy III's engine, so to speak.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
And I was just looking at some of these screenshots.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
It looks great.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
It looks like you still have five people on the battlefield, obviously,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
because that was kind of important to the story.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
But I was looking at pictures of, like, here's a picture.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I know this is great television here.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
But here's a picture of Rydia looking all younger and everything.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
And the Dragoons.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Pretty awesome.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
I know dsfamboy.com has a picture of the scans if you want to check that out.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
I'm sure they're all around the internet as well, though.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
However, no release date still revealed for this game,

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
but probably pretty soon in Japan and probably a little bit longer for us in the U.S.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Have you heard anything about a release in the U.S. for this, Loki?

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
No, the next two games come out here.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
There's Final Fantasy Tactics The Lion War, Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings,

19:24.000 --> 19:32.000
Front Mission DS, and Dragon Quest Monsters Joker.

19:32.000 --> 19:37.000
And this will probably be, if anything, in the spring, maybe.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
We'll see.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Well, that's all I have to say on Final Fantasy IV,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
but it is one of my favorite Final Fantasy games,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
so I'm very excited to see what they pull off of this.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Yeah, wake me up when they bring out VI.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Rob, are you spoonie?

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
It's a possibility.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
You're a spoonie bard.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I'll have you know.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
No.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Well, for anyone who's into mobile gaming,

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
there is an offering for the mobile phone.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
This Castlevania Order of Shadows that they're saying is a collaboration with Igarashi,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
who I got a hug from.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
That was great.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Well, sort of.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I took a picture with him.

20:12.000 --> 20:19.000
But I thought that it was very interesting that it just says collaboration,

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
so I don't really know if he's actually going to be involved on it.

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
There's also a developer's corner on the mobile website for Konami

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
where they have it listed there as the lead game designer is Tyrone Rodriguez.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
So, anyway.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
But it's supposed to be released on September 18th,

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
so if you really care, then have fun.

20:39.000 --> 20:48.000
I was looking at some of the pictures of it, and, well, I don't know.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
It's a cell phone game.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
How great can it be?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
I'll tell you what, though.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
It has the skull thingies.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
There's some pretty powerful stuff on cell phones right now.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Will it be dualed?

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
Well, not like that, but not necessarily game-wise, but application-wise.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Like, you know how you can download Gmail

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
and actually run that as an application on your phone?

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Depending on what, like, your phone has to be kind of made in the past couple years,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
and it runs like Java-based things.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
But now they have an Opera mini browser,

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
and I swear it is so much more powerful and better than the Sprint built-in browser

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
that I have on my phone otherwise.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
It's awesome.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Well, this doesn't look too bad.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
And Yahoo has its own thing now, too.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
So, I'm sure cell phone games are getting better and better,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
but it's still not my gaming platform of choice, that's for sure.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I know what the graphics remind me of.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
What's that?

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
It reminds me of Rondo of Blood on the TurboGrafx.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
That's what it looks like.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Interesting.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
All right, well, let's move on to some more stories.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
Yes, and speaking of other phone-based games,

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
and more homebrew stuff, of course.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
MAME has been ported over to the iPhone,

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
or at least it's beginning to be ported over there.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
Right now it doesn't really run a lot,

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
but some games like Pac-Man and Qbert run pretty well.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
And then, of course, some other ones you have to have with frame skipping

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
and lower sound quality.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
But, I don't know, it looks interesting.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
You had a start of better things to come, I'm sure.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
But the iPhone's going to be an interesting platform to program games on

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
because I would think that looks like a little bit beefier of a phone,

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
at least a pretty large screen on them,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
compared to, say, a normal phone.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
And then, of course, with the touchscreen stuff.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
It'll be interesting.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
It still doesn't sell me on an iPhone just yet.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Oh, fuck no, it's $600.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Well, you remember Extrofer from the show, right?

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
He just bought an iPhone, and he's all crazy about it.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
There are some really cool things that the iPhone does, don't get me wrong.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
And there is that impulse buyer in me that kind of wants one.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
And I think I put to somebody else,

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
an iPhone is probably on my list of wants above a PlayStation 3 still.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
But the thing about Apple is that you know next year

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
they're going to come out with a different model that is a little bit better.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Next year? Let's try, like, Christmas.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
We'll see. I don't know.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
RossdielUT says,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
The iPhone sucks for gaming, it has no real buttons.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
Jaded says, MySpace will redeem the iPhone, lol.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I think that means sarcasm there.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Again, if you want to join our chat, chat.orangessontrader.com.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Of course, lots of development going on for cell phone games,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
and also another system that kind of makes people raise their eyebrows

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
when new games are announced for it, the Dreamcast.

23:22.000 --> 23:27.000
Yes, the Dreamcast still has games being built for it.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
There's some games being made by Red Spot Games,

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
and at the Leipzig Games Convention they were showing Dalforce.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
It's a shooter title, which is up to four players,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
because remember the Dreamcast, you had four ports on there.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
And there's another game called Wind and Water Puzzle Battles.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
It's a puzzle action game that's being ported from another system.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
Both games are scheduled to be released in the first quarter of 2008.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
So all you hardcore Dreamcast fans can check out those games.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
I'm still missing, I have a box with my Dreamcast packed in it.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
Or two boxes. I've only found one, and that one has, like,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
just the AV cords and controllers.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I'm like, where's my Dreamcast?

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
You know, I think I might have it, because I only got two Dreamcasts.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Oh, maybe that's where it is, okay.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Maybe when your Dreamcast got put in a box of mine somehow,

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
when we lived together like three years ago.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
I need it back just so I can play Dreamcast games.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Sure thing, I don't really use it anymore.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Would you buy new games for Dreamcast, Dark Saga?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Yes.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Just because?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Yes.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
I mean, okay, don't get me wrong.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
I don't buy Dreamcast.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I don't know if I'd buy new games for Dreamcast,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
but if I remember correctly, I think the copy protection

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
of Dreamcast games was pretty crappy, so.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
All right, well, I don't think I'll be buying these,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
but it'll be interesting to see what happens with it.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
That's for sure.

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
Well, back to more present-day gaming information,

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I think this is really cool.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
They're basically saying that in the U.S.

24:56.000 --> 25:02.000
that the sales of games and consoles has raised,

25:02.000 --> 25:09.000
gone up by 37% since the time of 2006.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
Total sales coming up to $925 million,

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
which I think is actually pretty cool.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
But it's not a billion.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
So you know what?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Wake me up when it's a billion.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
The total sales are at $7 billion.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
All right.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Yeah.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
But basically, hardware itself is actually raised by 77.4%.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
$380.8 million sold.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
And actually, most of it is the Wii.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Wait, and this was over the same period last year is what it is?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Yeah.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Okay, that makes sense,

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
because you have new systems out there,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
the Wii and the PlayStation 3, for whatever it's worth,

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
that just weren't out there at this time last year.

25:49.000 --> 25:55.000
And the PS2 and PSP were outselling the Xbox 360, of course.

25:55.000 --> 26:00.000
Biggest games of the month were NCAA Football 08 on 360,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
Guitar Hero Encore, Roxy 80s, PS2 Wii Play,

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
NCAA Football 08 on PS2, and Mario Party 8 on Wii.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
That's amazing that Wii Play still continues to sell so many copies.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
But I guess it's just people wanting a free Wiimote.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Sort of.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
Also, I should point out that sales in Japan have also increased quite a bit.

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
The DS itself went actually just within a week,

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
sold 153,834 units.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
That was pretty cool.

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
This is the last week, fiscal week, I should say.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
For the Wii, it actually made it up to 73,938,

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
thanks to some of the really cool games that are out.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
PSP, no real game success.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
They've sold 33,715 units.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
PS3, 21,231 units.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
Numbers, numbers, numbers.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
What does it all mean, though?

26:58.000 --> 27:02.000
I'd say one of the biggest sellers were Everybody's Golf 5.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Huh.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Which is a game that's not even out here yet, right?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
No.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Interesting.

27:06.000 --> 27:14.000
Other games that were giving the PS2 a boost were J-League winning 11, 2007.

27:14.000 --> 27:21.000
But the poor Xbox 360, poor baby, only 2,445.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Poor, poor baby.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Wait, 2,000?

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Yeah.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Xbox 360s or regular Xboxes?

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
They don't like Xbox 360.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
No, that can't be right.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
There's got to be more than that.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
Blue Dragon sold more copies than that.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
My apologies.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Maybe it's regular Xboxes.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
It must be regular.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
No, it says Xbox 360.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Or in the last month.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I call shenanigans.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Probably the last one.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I'm hoping a typo then, because...

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
Yeah, it's got to be Xbox, regular Xboxes or something.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
It says Xbox 360, but...

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
I think it's crap.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
But it says it's based on region, so...

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Alright.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
Anyways, if you want to contribute to those wonderful sales numbers, there's going to

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
be some good stuff coming out this week, especially in the US.

28:02.000 --> 28:07.480
Starting off, if you're a fan of golf, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 will be coming out on PlayStation

28:07.480 --> 28:14.200
2, PlayStation 3, 360, Wii, and PSP, along with the DS, I believe.

28:14.200 --> 28:20.720
And also, Stuntman Ignition is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 this

28:20.720 --> 28:21.720
week.

28:21.720 --> 28:24.360
It's actually a pretty fun driving game.

28:24.360 --> 28:30.640
If you're into some role-playing games, Wild Arms 5 is coming out on PlayStation 2.

28:30.640 --> 28:36.520
Also on Xbox 360, we have Blue Dragon making its way out.

28:36.520 --> 28:41.800
Let's see here, you happen to be looking forward to Dynasty Warriors, Dynasty Warriors Gundam

28:41.800 --> 28:42.800
on PlayStation...

28:42.800 --> 28:47.760
Or, I'm sorry, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 will be coming out this week.

28:47.760 --> 28:56.800
Other games to note, MotoGP 2007 on the 360, Warhawk on the PlayStation 3, as well as Lair.

28:56.800 --> 29:01.840
Lair is going to be coming out on the 30th, so they kind of bumped it up a week.

29:01.840 --> 29:09.720
And let's see, on PC, Left Behind Eternal Forces, the game has been getting some controversy

29:09.720 --> 29:10.720
there.

29:10.720 --> 29:16.760
As well as the Guild Wars expansion is going to be making its way out, Eyes of the North.

29:16.760 --> 29:23.800
And let's see here, also on the Wii, we've got Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, as well as

29:23.800 --> 29:30.520
Brunswick Pro Bowling, which is supposed to be also coming out on PlayStation 2 and PSP,

29:30.520 --> 29:31.520
I believe.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.520
Okay.

29:32.520 --> 29:35.520
Are any of those games something you guys are picking up?

29:35.520 --> 29:39.800
I definitely will probably pick up Blue Dragon, even though the demo is kind of eh.

29:39.800 --> 29:42.180
And I'll probably pick up Metroid Prime as well.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.280
I'm going to be gone most of the week.

29:43.280 --> 29:49.360
I'm holding off on Blue Dragon, because I think I might get a copy anyways.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.240
This one was also interesting, I forgot to mention it.

29:51.240 --> 29:55.120
On PSP, they've got three games that are pretty cool.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.280
Deadhead Fred, which looked pretty cool.

29:58.280 --> 30:05.240
And then Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes, and Monster Hunter Freedom 2 looked actually pretty

30:05.240 --> 30:06.240
good.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.960
Are you going to get any of those games, Dark Saga?

30:08.960 --> 30:12.420
Probably Blue Dragon, but I'll just get down to rent whatever I want first.

30:12.420 --> 30:13.420
Buy before you buy.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.420
Exactly.

30:14.420 --> 30:15.420
Alright.

30:15.420 --> 30:17.960
Moving on to the Japanese release dates, and what's going on over there.

30:17.960 --> 30:24.400
Hitman Blood Money finally comes out in Japan this week on August 30th on the Xbox 360.

30:24.400 --> 30:29.600
Blade Storm, The Hundred Years War coming out on the PlayStation 3 also this week in

30:29.600 --> 30:30.600
Japan.

30:30.600 --> 30:34.240
$95 if you want to import that sucker into the US.

30:34.240 --> 30:38.080
Long time listeners of our program probably are interested in this release on the PlayStation

30:38.080 --> 30:39.080
2.

30:39.080 --> 30:45.540
Mania 2DX 13th Distorted is coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week.

30:45.540 --> 30:52.680
And also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Jintama Jinsan Toishiboku no Kabuki Machiniki.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.120
I love the long, long Japanese titles.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.980
It's an action game, but I don't know, the screenshots of this game look like it has

30:57.980 --> 31:02.880
an awful lot of cinematics for being a little bit of an action game.

31:02.880 --> 31:07.800
Another game coming out on the PlayStation 2 for Marvelous Entertainment, Katai Kiyoshi

31:07.800 --> 31:12.900
Hitman Reborn, Dream Hyper Battle, another action game coming out there on the PlayStation

31:12.900 --> 31:14.160
2.

31:14.160 --> 31:19.280
Coming out also on the PlayStation 2, Yoki Haim Denn in limited edition and regular formats,

31:19.280 --> 31:22.160
an adventure game coming to you from Idea Factory.

31:22.160 --> 31:26.880
And my favorite title of the week, love it, love it, love it, Nintendo DS will see the

31:26.880 --> 31:32.620
release of Love Cat Life will be coming out on the Nintendo DS, and here's the best part.

31:32.620 --> 31:38.240
If you look at the box art, it is a complete and utter ripoff of Nintendogs, because you

31:38.240 --> 31:42.760
have the cute little kitties there on the box art, and then it says Love Cat Life written

31:42.760 --> 31:43.760
in that same format.

31:43.760 --> 31:44.760
Rob.

31:44.760 --> 31:45.760
Rob.

31:45.760 --> 31:46.760
Rob.

31:46.760 --> 31:47.760
Rob.

31:47.760 --> 31:48.760
Rob.

31:48.760 --> 31:49.760
What?

31:49.760 --> 31:50.760
Rob.

31:50.760 --> 31:51.760
You want?

31:51.760 --> 31:52.760
Rob, give me baby kitties.

31:52.760 --> 31:53.760
I can has Love Cat Life?

31:53.760 --> 31:54.760
I want Love Cat Life.

31:54.760 --> 31:55.760
Love Cat Life needs to come out over here so I can play with the kitties.

31:55.760 --> 31:56.760
Although I want-

31:56.760 --> 31:57.760
Look, the cats sing.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.320
There's a singing competition for the cats.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.320
They sing.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.320
Yes.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.800
I think you play the, I think you play with them.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.960
This game looks like a complete ripoff of Nintendogs in every way except for this cat.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.520
The doggies don't sing.

32:08.520 --> 32:09.520
That's a good thing.

32:09.520 --> 32:13.560
Then there's, look, there's a cat rolling around in a toy truck, a little toy dump truck.

32:13.560 --> 32:14.560
I want to see.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.560
I want to see.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.560
That's so cute.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.560
And let's see here.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.680
A cat looking angry at the food that's been placed in front of them.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.680
I want to see.

32:21.680 --> 32:22.680
I'm sorry.

32:22.680 --> 32:26.160
I will post, since I know this makes for great radio, at least for the live folks, I will

32:26.160 --> 32:28.160
copy and paste that into chat so you can take a look at the game.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.800
Jeremy makes that face all the time.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.240
And now you know why.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.360
I don't like this food.

32:35.360 --> 32:38.400
Wake me up when they have lolcats the game.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.680
They should totally make lolcats the game.

32:39.680 --> 32:44.760
Dude, there are so many fucking animal sim games coming out this fall.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.640
It's not even funny.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.240
I'm looking at the chat room.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.920
D.V. says they should make Nintend ferrets.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.000
Karpakin says no ferret games to be found.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.200
Didn't that come up a couple weeks ago on the show?

32:57.200 --> 32:58.200
There are ferret games.

32:58.200 --> 33:01.800
I found one and it was on the Nintendo, on the Game Boy.

33:01.800 --> 33:04.160
But it wasn't the ferret a supporting character or something?

33:04.160 --> 33:06.000
No, it was a ferret game.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Let's see.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.640
Gold Banjo said Nintendog clones were doomed to happen.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.520
Yes, and they have been happening.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.320
There was that cats with a Z and dogs with a Z we had here.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.680
But seriously, go look at the box art for this game.

33:16.680 --> 33:21.880
It's a complete freaking ripoff of Nintendogs, but that's not a bad thing.

33:21.880 --> 33:25.080
Here's some of them that I can't remember off the top of my head.

33:25.080 --> 33:31.240
Gold Pets with a Z. Dolphins, yes, you can have pet dolphins.

33:31.240 --> 33:34.800
Imagine Babies, that's a pet baby sim.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.880
I kid you not.

33:37.880 --> 33:45.160
Imagine Babies with a Z, by the way, because it's edgy.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.320
There's Puppy Love coming out for the Wii.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.840
I remember that one.

33:49.840 --> 33:54.200
Was it Pets, Dogs, and Cats, and Hamster Life 2 or whatever?

33:54.200 --> 33:56.200
All the sequels to those games from last year.

33:56.200 --> 33:59.800
Okay, one of our frequent guests of Orange L'Entre D'O's back tonight, Mink Latov's here,

33:59.800 --> 34:01.520
fresh from Taco Bell with food.

34:01.520 --> 34:06.360
Thanks for smelling up the crappy food in the room.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.760
What did you want to say about Imagine Babies?

34:08.760 --> 34:13.880
I wonder if it uses that slide sensor that the Nintendo games in Japan use and you could

34:13.880 --> 34:15.360
slide babies around.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.680
It's almost like shaking them.

34:16.680 --> 34:20.360
It'd be so awesome.

34:20.360 --> 34:23.120
Imagine not having babies if you actually buy this game.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.520
I imagine it all the time.

34:24.520 --> 34:30.240
The Imagine Babies series or the Imagine series, I guess, is games meant for girls.

34:30.240 --> 34:36.520
So they have, I kid you not, they have the babies, they have fashion designer, they have

34:36.520 --> 34:42.600
a chef, because women need to cook, and then they also had, what was the other one that

34:42.600 --> 34:43.600
they had that was hilarious?

34:43.600 --> 34:44.600
Oh, pet doctor.

34:44.600 --> 34:50.480
I'm thinking my head hurt even more.

34:50.480 --> 34:55.120
I understand now because women should cook, take care of the animals, and have babies.

34:55.120 --> 34:57.280
That sounds like a perfect line up to me.

34:57.280 --> 35:02.320
See, now it's a bummer the webcam isn't working right now because Dark Soccer is giving me

35:02.320 --> 35:03.320
the finger.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.320
Thank you.

35:04.320 --> 35:05.320
Appreciate it.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.320
Yes, the webcam broke.

35:06.320 --> 35:07.320
I hit it with a mallet.

35:07.320 --> 35:08.320
I screwed up.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.320
That's a secret.

35:09.320 --> 35:12.000
I hit it with my evil power.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.240
So how about the UK, Rob?

35:13.240 --> 35:14.620
How about the UK?

35:14.620 --> 35:16.120
It's awesome.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.120
Like a hot dog.

35:18.120 --> 35:21.280
Coming out on the 28th.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.400
What if I don't like hot dogs?

35:23.400 --> 35:25.840
Then too after you.

35:25.840 --> 35:29.160
The only type of hot dogs I like are the Costco hot dogs.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.600
The Hebrew International ones.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.600
Those are really good.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.600
Those are the bomb.

35:32.600 --> 35:33.600
Anyway, sorry.

35:33.600 --> 35:36.560
When we used to work over there.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.560
You know what?

35:37.560 --> 35:39.400
Let's leave Orange Lounge Radio and create the hot dog podcast.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.400
That would be awesome.

35:41.400 --> 35:46.120
No, because they are made of lips and thighs.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.120
Ew.

35:47.120 --> 35:53.840
Anyway, on the 28th we have Warhawk on PS3, yay.

35:53.840 --> 36:01.840
On the 31st we have Blazing Angels Secret Mission, Boogie, Dragon Ball Z Goku Densetsu,

36:01.840 --> 36:10.960
Guild Wars Eye of the North, Stuntman Ignition on PS2 and Xbox 360, Tales of the World Radiant

36:10.960 --> 36:17.360
Mythology on PSP, Tamagotchi Party On, why are there still Tamagotchi games?

36:17.360 --> 36:19.520
Tamagotchi party off, please.

36:19.520 --> 36:20.520
Jeez.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.000
Tamagotchi party's over.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Go home.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.080
Although, you know what I found when I was cleaning, Rob?

36:25.080 --> 36:26.080
What?

36:26.080 --> 36:27.080
I found my old Digimon.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.080
Did you really?

36:28.080 --> 36:30.080
Oh my God, that's awful.

36:30.080 --> 36:34.680
Loki, can you paste that artwork in chat so we chatters can see it?

36:34.680 --> 36:35.680
I will do that.

36:35.680 --> 36:39.640
Loki found the artwork for Imagine Babies, and I swear to God it looks like a Sears catalog

36:39.640 --> 36:46.840
photo of this young girl, who can't be more than like 19, holding a young baby who looks

36:46.840 --> 36:48.600
to be about four years old.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.480
That's a big fucking baby.

36:50.480 --> 36:53.040
That's more like an eight month old baby, Rob.

36:53.040 --> 36:58.040
The baby's as big as she is, and the baby doesn't even like, imagine that popping out

36:58.040 --> 36:59.840
of your you-know-wheres.

36:59.840 --> 37:00.840
That's going to hurt.

37:00.840 --> 37:01.840
And guess what?

37:01.840 --> 37:06.880
Shane, you'll be happy to know that you can rock the baby, so therefore you can shake

37:06.880 --> 37:08.280
the baby.

37:08.280 --> 37:11.920
Loki, you need to get us a copy of this game for show research.

37:11.920 --> 37:12.920
I will do that.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.760
Rob wants to raise babies.

37:14.760 --> 37:15.760
That's right.

37:15.760 --> 37:19.800
See, now that we have the Operator 11 stuff, we can have these video shows of us playing

37:19.800 --> 37:20.800
Imagine Babies.

37:20.800 --> 37:21.800
It'll be fun.

37:21.800 --> 37:22.800
No.

37:22.800 --> 37:23.800
Super Metroid for the win.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.000
I did Super Metroid as a test show tonight.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.280
That's the one thing that's on stream right now.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.280
It's hot.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.280
Well then, can I finish reading the games?

37:30.280 --> 37:31.280
Oh, sorry.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.280
Because you distracted me with crap.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.280
Sorry, my bad.

37:33.280 --> 37:39.720
Um, only one more game on the 31st, we have Worms Open Warfare 2 on PSP and DS, another

37:39.720 --> 37:46.120
franchise that, while entertaining while it was new, needs to have that nail in the coffin.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.400
Or at least a chainsaw through the coffin.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.960
That's it.

37:50.960 --> 37:51.960
All done?

37:51.960 --> 37:52.960
Africa.

37:52.960 --> 37:53.960
You sure?

37:53.960 --> 37:54.960
You done?

37:54.960 --> 37:55.960
You sure you're finished?

37:55.960 --> 37:56.960
My head hurts.

37:56.960 --> 37:57.960
Leave me alone.

37:57.960 --> 37:58.960
Imagine Africa.

37:58.960 --> 37:59.960
Not sucking.

37:59.960 --> 38:00.960
Alright.

38:00.960 --> 38:01.960
Ow.

38:01.960 --> 38:07.200
Um, so, yeah.

38:07.200 --> 38:11.420
If you don't want to buy something and you want to kind of play a demo of it, there's

38:11.420 --> 38:18.320
a brand new demo for Folklore that's finally made its way out from Japan to both Europe

38:18.320 --> 38:20.200
and the US.

38:20.200 --> 38:21.740
And I've talked about this before.

38:21.740 --> 38:22.740
It's an awesome demo.

38:22.740 --> 38:23.740
You should check it out.

38:23.740 --> 38:27.680
You actually pull the souls of creatures out of their bodies and fight with them.

38:27.680 --> 38:31.640
I didn't like that game, but I didn't understand what the hell was going on when you were playing

38:31.640 --> 38:32.640
it.

38:32.640 --> 38:36.360
Now that it's in English, it should be a little bit easier to understand, and of course the

38:36.360 --> 38:41.400
full game is coming out early October, so check it out.

38:41.400 --> 38:45.160
It's finally nice to see that there's something to download to the Playstation 3.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.160
Hooray.

38:46.160 --> 38:49.800
Well, I know one game a lot of you folks on the Playstation 3 are looking forward to is

38:49.800 --> 38:51.560
the game Lair.

38:51.560 --> 38:58.840
And the president of Factor 5, who is creating this game Lair, Julian Egbrecht, gave a very

38:58.840 --> 39:03.320
interesting speech at the recent Leipzig conference going on in Germany.

39:03.320 --> 39:10.540
This developer called the ESRB standards and practices a bizarre system, and also called

39:10.540 --> 39:13.960
Lair's certification process a charade.

39:13.960 --> 39:18.200
And he said that in order to be approved for a teen rating, they had to cut out a lot of

39:18.200 --> 39:23.440
the blood originally that was in the game, but burning bodies, screaming burning bodies,

39:23.440 --> 39:25.200
that was okay.

39:25.200 --> 39:31.520
And Egbrecht went on to kind of say, hey, the MPAA's equivalent rating for movies, PG-13,

39:31.520 --> 39:35.240
permits this much bigger spectrum of violence.

39:35.240 --> 39:40.000
Apparently the ESRB has a taboo against sex in games, especially if you're talking about

39:40.000 --> 39:46.320
homosexuals, and is basically trying to get developers to band together against the ESRB.

39:46.320 --> 39:49.360
Push the violence, push the sex, but push it in an artistic way.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.920
Show that games are art.

39:51.920 --> 39:55.880
Interesting little cheer call from the Lair developer.

39:55.880 --> 39:58.540
Maybe he's trying to get people to buy Lair to support his cause, I don't know, but Lair

39:58.540 --> 40:00.200
looks kind of fun, actually.

40:00.200 --> 40:03.160
More games need more butt sex.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.400
You want more butt sex in games?

40:04.400 --> 40:05.480
Surprise butt sex in games.

40:05.480 --> 40:07.280
I don't know about that.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.680
All right.

40:09.680 --> 40:13.360
So that's all I've got to say on Lair.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.560
I have things to say on other stuff.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.760
Imagine that.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.520
I always have things to say.

40:18.520 --> 40:19.520
Imagine.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.520
Jamie not having anything to say.

40:20.520 --> 40:23.040
Hey Rob, you know what, shut up.

40:23.040 --> 40:29.800
I'll have you know real quick, there's a ton of funny, imagine, fake box arts that people

40:29.800 --> 40:30.800
have done.

40:30.800 --> 40:34.520
Like imagine a whore in a bed.

40:34.520 --> 40:38.120
Imagine all my fucking god kittens and domestic violence.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.100
Imagine if you don't eat, everyone will love you.

40:41.100 --> 40:45.840
Is imagine whore in a bed the prequel to imagine babies?

40:45.840 --> 40:52.600
No, because the whore just has a bunch of them and she donates them to science.

40:52.600 --> 40:55.920
Wait, that didn't pick up my mic.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.080
Imagine abortions.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.860
You could totally use the stylus in creative ways.

40:59.860 --> 41:01.720
How about imagine abstinence?

41:01.720 --> 41:03.880
Imagine the next story right now.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.320
Hey Rob.

41:05.320 --> 41:06.320
What?

41:06.320 --> 41:13.120
Anyway, so the PSP's on demand video service is out in Europe in 2008.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.480
Isn't that amazing?

41:14.480 --> 41:16.080
It's called Go.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.080
So you just go.

41:18.080 --> 41:19.600
Hey Jamie.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.600
Go.

41:20.600 --> 41:21.600
Go.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.600
No.

41:22.600 --> 41:23.600
Imagine going.

41:23.600 --> 41:29.000
Is that going to be like our new end joke that we're just going to beat into the ground?

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
It's already been done.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.440
I hate to tell you, it's over.

41:32.440 --> 41:33.440
Walk away.

41:33.440 --> 41:35.560
So, what's the big deal about this?

41:35.560 --> 41:38.280
It's a video download service.

41:38.280 --> 41:42.720
It will have a rich selection of high quality entertainment, so it says.

41:42.720 --> 41:45.320
Can I watch Lost on it?

41:45.320 --> 41:50.040
It's basically in conjunction with Sky's On Demand video.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.760
So no, you won't be able to watch Lost on it because you're not in the UK.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.760
Yeah, Rob.

41:53.760 --> 41:54.760
Oh.

41:54.760 --> 41:55.760
You can pretend.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.720
Well, can I travel to the UK and download Lost and then come back over here and watch

41:58.720 --> 42:00.400
it?

42:00.400 --> 42:06.360
Only if you live in the UK and can pay for it in the UK and all that.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.880
GS68 in our chat room sums it up really well.

42:08.880 --> 42:09.880
He says, stop imagining.

42:09.880 --> 42:10.880
There you have.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.600
GS68 also wants to know, can I watch porn on it?

42:13.600 --> 42:15.800
Will there be porn on the On Demand service?

42:15.800 --> 42:18.400
It just says entertainment.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.400
Adult entertainment?

42:19.400 --> 42:21.600
So maybe it's like the Fapperama channel.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.600
I don't know.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.640
That porn older we tonight, 13, 12.

42:24.640 --> 42:28.080
That porn On Demand service that you're looking for is called the web browser.

42:28.080 --> 42:29.080
Oh, okay.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.080
Thank you.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.960
It said this would be like sports movies.

42:31.960 --> 42:32.960
Rated E for everyone.

42:32.960 --> 42:33.960
Tunes.

42:33.960 --> 42:34.960
That type of stuff.

42:34.960 --> 42:35.960
All right.

42:35.960 --> 42:38.760
Well, hooray for the On Demand video service, I suppose.

42:38.760 --> 42:39.760
And porn.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.200
It would probably be like skin and axe level.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.680
Not very interesting porn.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.320
Well, guess what?

42:45.320 --> 42:50.480
There is something else that kind of go along with the other Go thing.

42:50.480 --> 42:54.680
Go Messenger, because I have to say that that way because there is an exclamation point

42:54.680 --> 43:00.160
in the middle of the word there, is a PSP, I mean, voice and video chat service that

43:00.160 --> 43:04.040
will be available also in Europe.

43:04.040 --> 43:05.040
And apparently...

43:05.040 --> 43:11.160
Wait, is there a webcam already out in Europe for you to use with the Go Messenger service?

43:11.160 --> 43:18.240
Yes, actually it's called the Go Cam and it's going to be available pretty soon here.

43:18.240 --> 43:24.040
I think some of this stuff is coming over here, but not the Go Messenger.

43:24.040 --> 43:29.640
So the Go service not only has Messenger, voice chat, video chat, but it also has movies

43:29.640 --> 43:32.440
On Demand.

43:32.440 --> 43:37.080
So it's like an all-in-one thing this Go service has.

43:37.080 --> 43:39.080
Is that what you're saying, Loki?

43:39.080 --> 43:40.080
Yes.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.080
All right.

43:41.080 --> 43:43.680
RoboBoy430 in chat wins with this comment.

43:43.680 --> 43:47.080
Agents are Go!

43:47.080 --> 43:48.720
Get it?

43:48.720 --> 43:49.720
Get it?

43:49.720 --> 43:52.080
It wasn't a PSP joke, I'll give you that.

43:52.080 --> 43:54.520
Rob, I need Vicodin to finish the show.

43:54.520 --> 43:56.840
I might have some.

43:56.840 --> 44:00.080
Moving on with other things that Sony has been talking about, this time for the PlayStation

44:00.080 --> 44:01.080
3.

44:01.080 --> 44:02.080
Guess what?

44:02.080 --> 44:07.400
There is a DVR service coming to the PlayStation 3 and this as well is coming to Europe.

44:07.400 --> 44:08.400
It's called Play TV.

44:08.400 --> 44:14.120
It's going to have two high definition tuners and you can record and play various free TV

44:14.120 --> 44:17.980
channels and there's also the standard definition support.

44:17.980 --> 44:22.680
It's going to also use the PSP's remote play features so you can watch live TV and record

44:22.680 --> 44:26.800
TV programs remotely on your PSP over a Wi-Fi connection.

44:26.800 --> 44:31.040
It's going to be first available in the UK, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain with more

44:31.040 --> 44:33.080
PAL territories to follow.

44:33.080 --> 44:37.640
Finally, a reason to have such a big hard drive on the PlayStation 3, yes?

44:37.640 --> 44:41.280
Well in Europe, I'm still waiting for an excuse over here.

44:41.280 --> 44:43.520
Don't you think that it's inevitable this will come out here though or do you think

44:43.520 --> 44:44.800
they're like testing it in Europe?

44:44.800 --> 44:49.120
They're not going to because there's no standardized digital service over here.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.120
D'oh.

44:50.120 --> 44:53.920
So until that happens, we'll still be waiting.

44:53.920 --> 44:54.920
Never.

44:54.920 --> 44:56.720
Well couldn't they team up with one service?

44:56.720 --> 45:00.020
Kind of like, didn't Xbox 360 team up with that new AT&T service?

45:00.020 --> 45:04.720
I don't know, but I would think if they're going to do a digital service, do like a satellite

45:04.720 --> 45:10.840
service, because that's supposedly all digital, but I don't know.

45:10.840 --> 45:11.840
All right.

45:11.840 --> 45:16.320
Well also, all digital every week is Dark Sakura's mailbag segment.

45:16.320 --> 45:17.320
Yay.

45:17.320 --> 45:21.200
Now, last week we had to skip the mailbag segment because of the stupid live 365 downtime

45:21.200 --> 45:25.160
and all that stuff that was going on and also we just didn't have a lot of mail last week

45:25.160 --> 45:29.760
so I said please email us and did the listeners email us this week?

45:29.760 --> 45:31.560
Do we get lots and lots of emails?

45:31.560 --> 45:32.560
Yup.

45:32.560 --> 45:33.560
Hooray.

45:33.560 --> 45:34.560
So we have a nice mailbag segment for you guys tonight.

45:34.560 --> 45:38.680
Of course, you can always interact with us by sending mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

45:38.680 --> 45:42.300
your emails and Dark Sakura will open up the mailbag and read some of her favorites so

45:42.300 --> 45:43.300
let's go to it.

45:43.300 --> 45:46.520
Reach in the mailbag and pull something out.

45:46.520 --> 45:48.640
What's there this week, Dark Sakura?

45:48.640 --> 45:51.000
Some stuff.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.760
The first of the emails, dun dun dun.

45:53.760 --> 45:57.800
Hey guys, I really like your idea about picking a game and playing it on air.

45:57.800 --> 46:03.240
You gotta have the game audio on there somehow, especially since Sakura has all the systems.

46:03.240 --> 46:06.040
Have a vote of what games everyone wants you to play each week.

46:06.040 --> 46:08.920
You could even replace the FUs of the week with it.

46:08.920 --> 46:09.920
Pendragon.

46:09.920 --> 46:15.040
Um, no, I need my FUs, but thank you for the idea.

46:15.040 --> 46:18.760
Dear OLR, listening to your ideas for games coming from old movies, I feel compelled to

46:18.760 --> 46:22.520
suggest that several of these studios get together and make a Smash Bros. or Capcom

46:22.520 --> 46:27.000
vs. SNK styled fighting game which brings the protagonists from these old classics together

46:27.000 --> 46:29.560
to beat the ever-loving crap out of each other.

46:29.560 --> 46:34.000
Specifically, I wish to see Ewoks fighting the alien cat from the cat from outer space.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.400
Perhaps also Skeletor.

46:35.400 --> 46:36.400
That is all.

46:36.400 --> 46:37.400
Warrior Bob.

46:37.400 --> 46:38.400
Warrior Bob is great.

46:38.400 --> 46:40.400
He's so much fun to hang out with.

46:40.400 --> 46:45.040
I was going to say, backing up to the last email real quick, thanks to our new thingy

46:45.040 --> 46:49.760
on Operator 11, that is definitely a possibility and that was all done on the laptop so I can

46:49.760 --> 46:53.560
haul that thing over to Jamie's house and we can have ourselves some turbo graphics

46:53.560 --> 46:56.600
playing broadcast so we are going to look into doing that in the future.

46:56.600 --> 46:57.600
Yes, Jamie?

46:57.600 --> 46:58.600
Yes.

46:58.600 --> 46:59.600
This must happen.

46:59.600 --> 47:00.600
And it does have the audio.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.720
It's not very good that it does have the audio.

47:02.720 --> 47:06.280
We could have ways around that with proper editing.

47:06.280 --> 47:07.880
There are ways.

47:07.880 --> 47:08.960
We have the technology.

47:08.960 --> 47:11.160
We can build it.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.160
Okay.

47:12.160 --> 47:13.160
If you build it, they will come.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.160
We'll see.

47:14.160 --> 47:18.120
Also, I want to say about the next email, what would you guys want to see in a game

47:18.120 --> 47:19.120
like that?

47:19.120 --> 47:21.280
A Super Smash Bros. game with movie characters.

47:21.280 --> 47:25.120
Chat room, that's open to you guys too, just out of curiosity.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.960
Too bad we already have a topic for tonight's List List.

47:26.960 --> 47:27.960
This will be a good one.

47:27.960 --> 47:29.720
What are you eating?

47:29.720 --> 47:30.720
Ice cream.

47:30.720 --> 47:31.720
That's what I ran out to get.

47:31.720 --> 47:34.200
I want ice cream.

47:34.200 --> 47:35.200
Let's see.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.200
What characters from movies would be good?

47:36.200 --> 47:39.200
How about some of the characters from Kill Bill, of course?

47:39.200 --> 47:40.200
Brokeback Mountain, Miklotov?

47:40.200 --> 47:43.700
I don't know if that would work.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.800
Who would fight in Brokeback Mountain?

47:45.800 --> 47:47.400
Would the two guys switch out?

47:47.400 --> 47:49.280
There was already a fight in that movie.

47:49.280 --> 47:50.280
Was there?

47:50.280 --> 47:51.280
Yeah.

47:51.280 --> 47:52.280
A little bit.

47:52.280 --> 47:53.280
Right?

47:53.280 --> 47:54.280
There was...

47:54.280 --> 47:55.640
Iron is your special weapon?

47:55.640 --> 47:59.520
I got food in my mouth.

47:59.520 --> 48:00.960
Anyway, never mind.

48:00.960 --> 48:01.960
This is a bad idea.

48:01.960 --> 48:02.960
Oh, wait.

48:02.960 --> 48:03.960
We got the chat room.

48:03.960 --> 48:04.960
Thank God.

48:04.960 --> 48:06.440
Kerpokken says, Silent Bob.

48:06.440 --> 48:09.080
DJ Dark Knight says, What about Rinky Bobby?

48:09.080 --> 48:11.440
Love Nanny Chronic.

48:11.440 --> 48:13.800
Black Boy says, Rose McGowan from Planet Terror.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.440
There you go.

48:15.440 --> 48:16.440
Nice.

48:16.440 --> 48:19.080
David Bowie from Labyrinth.

48:19.080 --> 48:22.440
With a special sidekick as Crotch.

48:22.440 --> 48:26.880
Labyrinth versus Dark Crystal, this must happen.

48:26.880 --> 48:27.880
Next email, please.

48:27.880 --> 48:30.480
David Bowie as the king of all cosmos.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.480
That would work.

48:31.480 --> 48:32.480
Oh, my God.

48:32.480 --> 48:37.120
He does sort of look like that now, too, doesn't he?

48:37.120 --> 48:39.120
He's still hot, though.

48:39.120 --> 48:40.120
Greetings.

48:40.120 --> 48:43.040
First of all, thanks for providing such an entertaining podcast on a weekly basis.

48:43.040 --> 48:44.040
You're welcome.

48:44.040 --> 48:45.040
Give me a dollar.

48:45.040 --> 48:46.640
Hey, I'm the one who asks for a dollar every week.

48:46.640 --> 48:48.040
I listen to it every week.

48:48.040 --> 48:50.040
Okay, give me five dollars.

48:50.040 --> 48:54.640
If you're not going to share, don't eat in front of us.

48:54.640 --> 49:00.080
Oh, never mind, it's caramel, and caramel sucks.

49:00.080 --> 49:02.080
I'd rather have a taco.

49:02.080 --> 49:05.240
It's dulce de leche, just so you know.

49:05.240 --> 49:06.720
Yuck.

49:06.720 --> 49:08.480
Read the email, ladies.

49:08.480 --> 49:09.960
It's what we pay you to do.

49:09.960 --> 49:11.160
Shane's making me laugh.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.160
I can't stop.

49:12.160 --> 49:16.160
First of all, okay, I already read all that.

49:16.160 --> 49:20.800
I listen to it every week, and it makes my drive to work that much more tolerable.

49:20.800 --> 49:21.800
Sorry about this week.

49:21.800 --> 49:24.800
I hope I didn't run you off the road with- I want to read the email, Rob.

49:24.800 --> 49:25.800
I have a bunch of them.

49:25.800 --> 49:26.800
I want to interrupt you, Jamie.

49:26.800 --> 49:29.800
I want you to kiss my ass, but not.

49:29.800 --> 49:33.480
It's fine to follow the email in this conversation.

49:33.480 --> 49:35.480
No, it is not.

49:35.480 --> 49:36.480
Shane said it was on the email.

49:36.480 --> 49:37.480
It is not.

49:37.480 --> 49:38.480
A little background.

49:38.480 --> 49:40.160
I have been playing video games for over 28 years.

49:40.160 --> 49:45.120
I am now 35 and have a family, which probably is a little different from your main audience.

49:45.120 --> 49:48.640
I also recognize that a lot of the places you guys describe because I'm a Bay Area person

49:48.640 --> 49:49.640
as well.

49:49.640 --> 49:53.000
Anywho, I will try to keep this short, famous last words.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.360
And I don't think you quite accomplished that, but oh well.

49:56.360 --> 50:00.240
Regarding the discussion of Red Rings on Xbox 360, I completely understand Loki's frustration

50:00.240 --> 50:05.720
in regards to some fans or fanboys commenting regarding the failure rate.

50:05.720 --> 50:10.500
Countless forums and blogs have perpetuated this 33% failure rate as fact when in reality

50:10.500 --> 50:16.440
is merely a number drawn from a tired interview in Australia with some anonymous XEB game

50:16.440 --> 50:17.440
employees.

50:17.440 --> 50:18.440
Someone's ass.

50:18.440 --> 50:19.440
Yeah.

50:19.440 --> 50:24.560
While I wouldn't care if fanboys or other systems believe this themselves, I am irritated

50:24.560 --> 50:28.200
when misinformation is spread around and influenced potential buyers to not buy one because of

50:28.200 --> 50:29.560
false rumors.

50:29.560 --> 50:33.240
Of course, I am in an awkward position actually agreeing with Loki as he tirelessly attacks

50:33.240 --> 50:34.240
the Mac.

50:34.240 --> 50:35.240
Just kidding.

50:35.240 --> 50:38.360
I am a Mac fan, though, and even worked for Apple for a time.

50:38.360 --> 50:42.240
Isn't that amazing how many Mac fans we have that stick with this show even though Loki

50:42.240 --> 50:44.900
you know, bashes Apple products when he can?

50:44.900 --> 50:45.900
Your Mac made me want to die last night.

50:45.900 --> 50:48.640
Just because I don't like them doesn't mean you shouldn't like them.

50:48.640 --> 50:51.560
I just, I'm giving you my opinion.

50:51.560 --> 50:54.480
You're like, well, we should all think like you.

50:54.480 --> 50:55.480
Way to be sheep.

50:55.480 --> 50:56.480
People, my God.

50:56.480 --> 50:58.240
Your Mac made me want to die last night.

50:58.240 --> 51:03.080
You know, if you didn't challenge my opinion, then you know, you would just be sheep.

51:03.080 --> 51:04.640
Why did my Mac make, oh wait, be quiet, Loki.

51:04.640 --> 51:05.960
Why did my Mac make you want to die last night?

51:05.960 --> 51:08.040
Because you actually need to put AIM on that.

51:08.040 --> 51:09.040
Why?

51:09.040 --> 51:10.040
Use Meebo.

51:10.040 --> 51:11.040
I hate Meebo.

51:11.040 --> 51:12.040
I hate you.

51:12.040 --> 51:13.040
I hate you back.

51:13.040 --> 51:14.040
Email.

51:14.040 --> 51:15.040
No.

51:15.040 --> 51:16.040
You, you were mean to me, Rob.

51:16.040 --> 51:17.040
I'm going to leave now.

51:17.040 --> 51:18.040
Bye.

51:18.040 --> 51:19.040
Do you want some ice cream?

51:19.040 --> 51:20.040
Yuck.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.040
What are you trying to do?

51:21.040 --> 51:22.040
Make my butt bigger?

51:22.040 --> 51:23.040
Well, can I ice cream?

51:23.040 --> 51:24.040
Make her read the email.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.040
Can I finish reading the email?

51:25.040 --> 51:26.040
We'll see.

51:26.040 --> 51:27.040
It's Dolce De Leche.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.040
Oh, no thanks.

51:28.040 --> 51:29.040
What the hell is your people's problem with caramel?

51:29.040 --> 51:30.040
It is gross.

51:30.040 --> 51:37.040
Anyway, can I finish reading the email?

51:37.040 --> 51:38.040
I suppose.

51:38.040 --> 51:39.520
Playing online.

51:39.520 --> 51:43.040
My question for all of you is how much do you truly enjoy playing with strangers online?

51:43.040 --> 51:45.480
Oh, I love strangers.

51:45.480 --> 51:47.200
For me, it's a massive turn off.

51:47.200 --> 51:48.200
I said that, by the way.

51:48.200 --> 51:54.480
No, for me, it's a massive turn off to play with immature jerks constantly, so I have

51:54.480 --> 51:56.640
set up a small league with people I actually know in person.

51:56.640 --> 52:00.440
I rarely ever do any online gaming with strangers anymore.

52:00.440 --> 52:04.600
Honestly, I usually just play with people I know either that or I'm like, no, I don't

52:04.600 --> 52:05.600
want to fight you.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.600
Shut up.

52:06.600 --> 52:08.200
Sometimes I play World of Warcraft.

52:08.200 --> 52:09.200
Sometimes.

52:09.200 --> 52:10.200
Keep up the good work, guys.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.280
Dark Charger.

52:12.280 --> 52:15.040
I don't like to play with strangers online either.

52:15.040 --> 52:19.560
My mommy told me not to talk to strangers, especially on Xbox Live.

52:19.560 --> 52:24.880
Once in a great while, I will, but I totally use that feedback feature if I have to.

52:24.880 --> 52:25.880
So.

52:25.880 --> 52:26.880
Okay.

52:26.880 --> 52:30.360
And which I will not read online as per your request.

52:30.360 --> 52:31.360
Thank you for your PS.

52:31.360 --> 52:32.360
Oh, yes.

52:32.360 --> 52:33.360
I saw that too.

52:33.360 --> 52:37.200
I'm a rat, especially since, well, my other hobbies.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.200
Ah, fair dear.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.200
Yes.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.200
My other hobbies.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.200
Anyway.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.200
Nice email.

52:42.200 --> 52:43.200
Porn.

52:43.200 --> 52:46.840
This is from Robert M. Just two quick thoughts.

52:46.840 --> 52:52.200
One, I almost hope Uwe Boll announces plans to make a movie based on Manhunt and is immediately

52:52.200 --> 52:54.040
sued by You Know Who.

52:54.040 --> 52:57.480
That particular clash of personalities would likely end in destruction of the career of

52:57.480 --> 53:01.520
one or both, seeing how neither would back down prior to that point.

53:01.520 --> 53:11.960
Secondly, I was wondering if HMMJDS has only songs from the Disney show or the Hannah Montana

53:11.960 --> 53:16.200
game or stuff from the average non-fan of the show would recognize.

53:16.200 --> 53:20.680
According to IGN, it does allow you to create your own music tracks, nothing about songless

53:20.680 --> 53:24.280
though or if play to the present music is even an option.

53:24.280 --> 53:26.080
I don't know, but I'll try to find out.

53:26.080 --> 53:28.600
I'd be surprised if it weren't.

53:28.600 --> 53:30.480
And apparently, oh yeah.

53:30.480 --> 53:34.480
Is Footy Monster, our resident Hannah Montana fan in chat tonight?

53:34.480 --> 53:36.480
I do see he is, so maybe he can answer that.

53:36.480 --> 53:38.160
I don't know.

53:38.160 --> 53:44.120
Nobody loves Hannah Montana more than Footy Monster.

53:44.120 --> 53:45.120
The next email.

53:45.120 --> 53:46.120
Hi guys.

53:46.120 --> 53:51.520
MeezerCrazy, I guess that's how it's pronounced here.

53:51.520 --> 53:54.640
I'm new to your podcast and I think you guys are funny as hell, especially Dark Soccer.

53:54.640 --> 53:55.640
You crack me up.

53:55.640 --> 53:56.840
Oh, thank you.

53:56.840 --> 53:59.160
I crack lots of people up when I have a mallet.

53:59.160 --> 54:04.160
Anyway, I was wondering if any of you would know if there are any plans for Nintendo on

54:04.160 --> 54:09.120
releasing any Turbografx-16 CD-ROM or Super CD games on the Virtual Console, like Splash

54:09.120 --> 54:10.440
Lake, Monster Lair or Dracula X.

54:10.440 --> 54:13.200
Oh God, I love you already.

54:13.200 --> 54:16.920
Can you think of any Turbo CD games that you'd like to see on the Virtual Console?

54:16.920 --> 54:19.700
Thanks and keep up the good work.

54:19.700 --> 54:25.040
I'm just going to say MeezerCrazy since he actually put his name in the email.

54:25.040 --> 54:35.160
I would love to see the Valis series.

54:35.160 --> 54:41.320
It was just one of the regular Sega CD games.

54:41.320 --> 54:43.900
I would actually love to see Sapphire.

54:43.900 --> 54:48.280
It was a game that was one of the arcade CDs.

54:48.280 --> 54:51.720
It was actually one of the first polygon-based shooters.

54:51.720 --> 54:55.160
Very, very, very good game.

54:55.160 --> 54:59.960
I am by no means an expert on these old CD-based systems, so I will simply say Night Trap and

54:59.960 --> 55:00.960
leave it at that.

55:00.960 --> 55:03.480
That wasn't even on the Turbografx-16 CD.

55:03.480 --> 55:05.040
Well, it should have been.

55:05.040 --> 55:07.320
No, because Night Trap kind of sucked ass.

55:07.320 --> 55:11.920
Okay, it sucked a lot of ass, but it had Dana Plato in it.

55:11.920 --> 55:16.040
But I'd love to see Rondo of Blood out there.

55:16.040 --> 55:19.080
I was a little distracted during that previous email because I was trying to talk to Footy

55:19.080 --> 55:22.200
Monster in the chat room and heard us say his name on the show, but he was too busy

55:22.200 --> 55:25.360
looking at porn to hear what the question was.

55:25.360 --> 55:29.400
And Footy Monster did finally, after I clarified with him, he says, it's not known right now

55:29.400 --> 55:33.280
what music is in the Hannah Montana game, but I'm guessing it will be from the show.

55:33.280 --> 55:37.520
At least that's what the big hairy guy on the stage said.

55:37.520 --> 55:38.520
The big hairy guy on the show?

55:38.520 --> 55:40.360
In the porn or in the Hannah Montana thing?

55:40.360 --> 55:42.040
Just kidding.

55:42.040 --> 55:43.780
Okay.

55:43.780 --> 55:44.780
More email.

55:44.780 --> 55:46.640
God, there's a bunch of really long ones.

55:46.640 --> 55:47.640
I can has email?

55:47.640 --> 55:51.480
Okay, this one says, call me Surtur.

55:51.480 --> 55:52.480
Okay.

55:52.480 --> 55:53.880
Hi Surtur.

55:53.880 --> 55:57.960
Every Monday morning I wake up and my magical PSP has downloaded the latest OLR podcast.

55:57.960 --> 56:00.160
I can listen to it on the way to work.

56:00.160 --> 56:02.500
I've been playing Jean Dark.

56:02.500 --> 56:05.160
It is a strategy RPG based on the Joan of Arc story.

56:05.160 --> 56:07.320
Who says the PSP doesn't have great games?

56:07.320 --> 56:08.320
I don't know.

56:08.320 --> 56:09.320
I think I've said that before.

56:09.320 --> 56:12.080
That would be Shane saying that.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.760
Thanks again for the show every week.

56:13.760 --> 56:14.760
PSP sucks.

56:14.760 --> 56:16.160
Doesn't have good games.

56:16.160 --> 56:17.160
You were just playing Silent Hill.

56:17.160 --> 56:18.160
I know.

56:18.160 --> 56:19.560
Back that shit up.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.840
Is it out yet?

56:20.840 --> 56:21.840
No.

56:21.840 --> 56:22.840
It does not have good games.

56:22.840 --> 56:26.920
PSP has a very bright future for it though and a lot of that is thanks to Konami because

56:26.920 --> 56:35.720
of Silent Hill Origins, the Metal Gear game is great and the Castlevania, what the hell

56:35.720 --> 56:36.720
is it called?

56:36.720 --> 56:39.720
Akumajo Chronicles or whatever the shit that thing was.

56:39.720 --> 56:40.720
Yeah.

56:40.720 --> 56:42.120
Rondo of blah blah blah.

56:42.120 --> 56:43.120
Alright.

56:43.120 --> 56:44.120
And Brooktown.

56:44.120 --> 56:45.120
And Brooktown?

56:45.120 --> 56:46.120
No.

56:46.120 --> 56:47.120
No Brooktown.

56:47.120 --> 56:48.120
No Brooktown.

56:48.120 --> 56:49.120
K Kland.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.120
Alright.

56:50.120 --> 56:51.120
Anyway.

56:51.120 --> 56:52.540
Hello, this is Kripatkin from Kripatkin and Hendrick's Game Review Show.

56:52.540 --> 56:53.540
That's cool.

56:53.540 --> 56:54.540
Hi.

56:54.540 --> 56:55.540
He's in our chat room tonight.

56:55.540 --> 56:57.880
And that's the show that's sandwiched in between us when we have our rebroadcast on

56:57.880 --> 56:58.880
all games.

56:58.880 --> 56:59.880
That's hot.

56:59.880 --> 57:00.880
Yes.

57:00.880 --> 57:04.440
I've been listening to your shows, well, Shavvling 2 and FromWhere, picture of my place

57:04.440 --> 57:05.440
of work is below.

57:05.440 --> 57:06.440
Okay.

57:06.440 --> 57:09.880
The email that we use is non HTML, so sorry.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.040
Nope.

57:11.040 --> 57:15.160
And thought I'd drop you a line considering the lack of email you've been getting recently.

57:15.160 --> 57:21.780
I'm going to skip on past the location stuff because it says I can't show it.

57:21.780 --> 57:25.840
You know, since this email is coming from a British listener, I think you should read

57:25.840 --> 57:26.840
this in an accent.

57:26.840 --> 57:27.840
No.

57:27.840 --> 57:33.360
No, I'm not, because I'm tired, and I have a concussion.

57:33.360 --> 57:35.840
I think you should read it within a spot of accents.

57:35.840 --> 57:37.160
I don't care if you have a concussion.

57:37.160 --> 57:38.160
Oh, no.

57:38.160 --> 57:40.120
So, yes, my email topic.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.720
What do you think is going to...

57:42.720 --> 57:51.840
I don't care how you read it, just read the damn email.

57:51.840 --> 57:52.840
Excuse me, Shane.

57:52.840 --> 57:53.840
Hi.

57:53.840 --> 57:54.840
Then remove him from the studio.

57:54.840 --> 57:57.960
This is horrible radio.

57:57.960 --> 57:59.960
Tell Shane to shush.

57:59.960 --> 58:02.480
Shane shush email now.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.800
Okay, where was I?

58:04.800 --> 58:06.840
So, yes, my email topic.

58:06.840 --> 58:10.920
What do you think it's going to take to stop the gaming industry focus on the six-week

58:10.920 --> 58:13.600
window at the end of the year to sell games?

58:13.600 --> 58:18.320
This year is just chronic for making, sorry, chronic for amazing titles being squeezed

58:18.320 --> 58:20.160
into this short period of time.

58:20.160 --> 58:23.800
Just to give you an idea of how bad it is this year, take a look at the list.

58:23.800 --> 58:29.180
Super Paper Mario, not out in Europe yet, Metro Prime, and Metro, Metroid Prime 3, Super

58:29.180 --> 58:35.600
Mario Galaxy, Halo 3, PGR4, Assassin's Creed, Crysis, Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Mass Effect,

58:35.600 --> 58:39.560
Call of Duty 4, Unreal Tournament 3, Ratchet and Clank, Tools of Destruction, World in

58:39.560 --> 58:46.280
Haze, Heavenly Sword, Medal of Honor, Airborne, SEGA Rally, Lost Odyssey, Ace Combat 6, Jericho,

58:46.280 --> 58:48.480
Enemy Territory, Quake Wars, Two Worlds.

58:48.480 --> 58:51.840
Do you remember a game called Beyond Good and Evil?

58:51.840 --> 58:54.000
It was a great game that appeared in Autumn of 2003.

58:54.000 --> 58:57.120
I do remember that game actually.

58:57.120 --> 59:01.360
It was buried by many other less entertaining titles and undeservedly ended up in the bargain

59:01.360 --> 59:02.520
bin.

59:02.520 --> 59:07.360
Makes one wonder which out of the games will suffer a familiar fate.

59:07.360 --> 59:11.040
As I ask you and the rest of the OLR team, when is the gaming industry going to wake

59:11.040 --> 59:16.960
up and realize that the video games can be released year round and not just near Christmas

59:16.960 --> 59:17.960
time?

59:17.960 --> 59:22.420
For what it's worth, my view on it is that when people stop seeing video games as only

59:22.420 --> 59:29.880
being for children games, will cease to be holiday only sale.

59:29.880 --> 59:32.320
Sadly, I don't see that attitude changing anytime soon.

59:32.320 --> 59:34.760
Holy nuts, the almighty coin.

59:34.760 --> 59:37.640
It's Christmas, if they moved Christmas then they could have...

59:37.640 --> 59:39.320
Just keep up the good work.

59:39.320 --> 59:40.960
Seriously, I mean...

59:40.960 --> 59:42.960
It's money, all money.

59:42.960 --> 59:47.720
It's development cycles I think, but no, if you look at it, of course they want to try

59:47.720 --> 59:50.320
to get as many sales in before their fiscal years are up.

59:50.320 --> 59:55.160
That's why you see both Christmas and March as big times for games.

59:55.160 --> 59:59.600
Just look at, right now of course since I sell games at work and stuff, we work on order

59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.120
forms and that kind of thing.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:09.640
For August it was three pages long, for October it's about ten to eleven pages long, and November

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.400
I'm guessing probably around fifteen pages long.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.520
So that kind of gives you an idea of how much stuff is coming out and it just gets lumped

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:25.520
into that week wherever the fifteenth of November falls and then after that drops down to nothing.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.800
So it's more of the fault of the soccer moms of America than the gaming industry necessarily,

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.800
right?

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.560
The one day craziness.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:39.000
But I mean if a good game was released in April, or what's a dead month for gaming?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.840
April is super dead.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:46.080
Okay, if a good game is released in April, I mean shouldn't that still translate to good

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.160
sales for the company year round, right?

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:52.840
Yeah, I mean look at, well this April there was Super Paper Mario and Guitar Hero 2 on

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.000
the 360, and those games sold awesome.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:04.280
Another example of a slow month July, there was NCAA Football 08, and NASCAR.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.480
It's Mario Strikers I guess.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.920
But other than that there wasn't a whole lot.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.840
I mean there's times now during the summer it's like, well shit, there's nothing I really

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.820
want to play for a while, whereas in the fall it's like, crap, there's too much stuff, I

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.440
don't know what I want to play.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.280
People aren't going to spend more money towards fall on games.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:31.480
I think if they just spread out their releases all year long, it might be better for them.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.560
Although there are some companies that do that, I mean look at Microsoft and Nintendo,

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.120
they do spread out their releases.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.880
They have about a new game coming out each month, a big AAA game I guess.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:46.360
Well still UT made a good point that Dead Rising came out in March and did very well.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.040
Dead Rising came out in August.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.040
Really?

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.040
I thought.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.560
No, I don't remember it coming out late.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:57.000
Regardless, there's a couple good games that do come out off cycle every year, no matter

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.960
what the specifics are.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.000
But I was going to say, to me though, games really aren't doing anything different than

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
movies and music.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.640
I mean look at the movie industry, all the big movies are always out in the summertime.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.560
And then when do all the crap movies come out?

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.980
After Christmas, like January, February is when, well, sometimes you have the Oscar movies

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.060
trying to push for awards or whatever.

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:20.660
But you know, there's a lot of dead, the same kind of cycle, because when do the consumers

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:24.220
buy most of their movies during the summer when the kids aren't in school, right?

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:25.640
And then same thing with CDs.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:28.080
CDs follow a very similar pattern to video games.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.240
All the big CDs come out, what, September, October, November, up to the Christmas season,

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.800
and then when you get into January, it's a dead month for the CD and music releases.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.000
So of course I'm not sure how online distribution changes all that, if at all, but just kind

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
of something to think about.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.880
Dead Rising was August 9th, 2006.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:48.200
Okay, I don't, then what did it say March for?

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.200
It doesn't matter.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.200
Well, anyway.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.640
Shall I move on to another email?

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.640
If you must.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.660
Dear OLR crew, after listening live last week, I went and downloaded the podcast and heard

01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:59.880
all the praise for Bioshock go-around.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:04.120
If Rob was so convinced to buy it, even though he wasn't a first person shooter kind of guy,

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.360
then by golly, it's something I need to take a look at.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.360
I went and plugged down $200 on a video card the next day and stuck it in my computer,

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.520
and the first thing I did was go and download the Bioshock demo.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.520
Friggin' amazing.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.000
I need this game right now of the paychecks not being till the end of the month.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Preclude this.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.240
Thanks to Rob for convincing me.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.560
The only complaint I have is the movement is a little sluggish for my taste, reminiscent

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.360
of playing Halo on the PC.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.680
I was looking for that run button everywhere.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.060
On the 360, because of the awkwardness of dual analog input, I imagine this allows for

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:38.520
more precision, but I guess I just like my games at faster pace.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.560
I thought the atmosphere was amazing, with the voices and footsteps signaling there was

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.080
something out there that you can't see.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.600
Chilled me to the bones.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.760
Of course, my friend who's a complete Counter-Strike addict played the demo and said, I can hear

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:52.520
them from a mile away, and if they didn't make any noise, it'd be scarier when they

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.520
popped out.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.240
But I think the thrill of knowing there's something out there and you don't know when

01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.400
or where it'll come from is better than a cheap pop-out monster thrills.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.600
I know you guys are Silent Hill fans, so which kind of stimuli gets your adrenaline pumping?

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:25.600
Creepy noises and evil things or jump-out-and-scare-the-crap-out-of-you AZHP?

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:52.600
I would say that the atmospheric scary is way better than the pop-out-of-nowhere scary,

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:58.800
even though in the Silent Hill PSP demo, I did jump a couple times because of the stupid

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:05.040
pop-out-of-nowhere sort of scariness, but I feel that's a cheap thrill, whereas the

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:10.960
noises and just the atmosphere stuff is way better and you are more rewarded with that.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:20.080
I think I would say that the atmosphere adds to the pop-outs, it makes it even more scary.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:25.160
I tried to play Bioshock PC, but my video card couldn't handle it, cry?

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:34.360
I have to say that I prefer the atmosphere set up, I really love psychological type horror.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.760
I don't like the shock value things.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:41.560
When people were telling me about Saw and all those, I was like, that just sounds retarded,

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.560
I don't care.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.560
Yeah, that's gross.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:47.320
I don't like Saw, but that's different to me.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.960
I don't think that gross is horror.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:58.020
I have seen tragedies that gross fits in with.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:03.800
I think that a good horror movie or game is something that you don't really know it's

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:10.000
meant to be scary, I think, where you think it's just situational and then when something

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.820
completely unexpected happens, not the jumping out, but when you hear the noises and then

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.200
you think, oh, well, it's going to be this thing and it turns out to be something completely

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.200
different.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:22.720
It's a twist, especially when it messes with your head.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.720
All right.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.720
Any more email?

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.720
We've got a long email segment tonight.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.720
Battle Royale was funny, too.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.720
Huh?

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.720
Nothing.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.080
I was saying that Battle Royale wasn't scary, it was funny.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.520
I think Silence of the Lambs is a way better movie than something like Saw.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.160
Silence of the Lambs is really good.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:37.160
But anyway.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.160
And Nive.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.440
Hey, OLR, it's me, Solar Wing.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:44.160
I can't be in the chat tonight as work frowns upon me using their internet for live radio

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.440
stream and such.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.240
I just wanted to start this off by saying thank you.

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:53.160
OLR saved my sanity and possibly me saying something I'd regret.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.360
I took a short trip out to Alberta to see some family and go back to my past.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.900
Of course, there was the obligatory meeting of the cousins.

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:06.160
To describe them, they are blonde valley girls who by some chance of nature have more than

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:11.800
one brain cell and can pull high marks out of their pretentious asses.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:16.520
I brought my DS and my PSP, but I couldn't get the meeting out of my head.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:24.920
I was going over what I would say in the morning.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.680
Before I do that, I listened to the podcast I'd previously downloaded.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:35.440
I brought 21-odd casts and listened to about 8 for a bit, but I was getting more annoyed.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.700
But then I started to listen to your show and I started to calm down.

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:42.840
The humor and pacing was perfect for what I needed, which was to calm the hell down.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:45.640
I forgot all about the night and simply enjoyed the show.

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:50.400
For that, I'm truly thankful and the only thing that I can suggest is adding the catchphrase

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.240
vehicular homicide is wrong even if they are your cousins.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:59.960
Vehicular homicide is great, especially if they're your cousins.

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:04.200
I don't understand because how is this show calming because this show has me more on edge

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.200
tonight.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.360
I think we're distracting.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.360
And if you don't think about the crap that's pissing you off, then maybe you feel better.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.360
Because tonight's show makes me want to do vehicular manslaughter on my cousins.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.080
Listen to me, Rob.

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.080
You're so mean.

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.080
Whatever.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.040
Get over it, baby.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.000
Imagine not being a baby.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Alright.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.440
Are there more emails?

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:29.440
No, there's just this one.

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.280
Oh my god!

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:34.000
How many freaking emails did we get this week?

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.960
You do know we like to finish the show in like three hours, right?

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.960
I'm reading the rest of this.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:38.960
Hush.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:39.960
Alright.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:40.960
Rob.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:41.960
No.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:46.920
To bring this back to video game talk, before I left for my trip, it's tradition I buy a

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:52.120
new game, so I've been holding out and getting Phoenix Wright 2 as I've never played the

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.120
first one.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.240
I would like to play them in order.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.100
I picked it up but didn't open it while I was out there and had a chance to go around

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.560
the area and found an EB.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:06.260
We went in and I found the first Phoenix Wright for less than $50.

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:09.080
It was the lowest bidding off of eBay before I left.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.560
It was actually $34 Canadian with tax.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.360
Alberta only has like 6% tax compared to 15%.

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.800
So I picked that up and have almost beaten it.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.840
This game is at least a must rent if you have a DS.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.760
From there we went to the West Edmonton Mall and I found ourselves in an arcade where for

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.040
the first time I saw Guitar Freaks in Dramania.

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:33.160
I can now agree that Guitar Hero wasn't original but did a lot of things right.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:36.080
Now listening to the last week's show, I have some questions for you.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:45.260
The Smash Bros. site has been updating their site daily and I only have to say I can't

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:50.160
wait for this game to come out but do you think they will have online in it?

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.000
In my opinion it would be Sonic and Tails.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.380
I'm so sorry Solar Wing, you're great but your emails use punctuation please.

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:07.520
And non-sentences are very very hard to follow.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.680
Now I know why when I read the email you said I'm like Jamie when I was yelling about their

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.560
grammar and stuff.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:18.680
As much as I'd like to see online, I think there's going to be as much online as there

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:25.760
is punctuation in this email.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.240
I wish they would go online with it and I wish maybe that would be like a big surprise

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:35.480
Nintendo is going to pull out of their butt come the end of the year.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.720
Maybe it will be a big E for All announcement since nobody else is going to announce anything

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.720
in E for All.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720
I don't know.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:43.280
But I'm not holding my breath.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.560
Super paraphrasing powers activate!

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.120
Okay, yes.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.000
This one's for you and me, Rob.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.020
Since we both played Ragnarok online, which I think is funny to being referred to, aka

01:10:54.020 --> 01:11:01.200
Fisher Price, my first MMORPG, he and his sister are crippling RO addiction and they're

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:06.760
on the way to the 13 steps.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.880
What is a good MMO to play?

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.640
She suggested World of Warcraft, but she says it looks complicated.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.120
World of Warcraft is not that complicated.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.120
Try Rose Online.

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.560
I don't know that one.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.640
It's another Gravity game, sort of Ragnarok-y.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:27.200
Actually, Ragnarok 2 is out in beta.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.280
Kingdom of Loathing.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.280
Puzzle Pirates.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:34.880
Yeah, Puzzle Pirates might be fun for that if you like puzzles and stuff and it's pretty

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.880
easy to get into.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.680
I mean, I didn't care for it, but you might like it.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.680
It's kind of fun.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.000
Like, if you like the PopCappy-type games, you'd probably like Puzzle Pirates.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Tetranet!

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
No.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.600
Kingdom of Loathing would be great, though, because of all the monsters that have misspellings.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:54.000
I forget, it was like the cemetery or something where everything was misspelled, all the monster

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000
names.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000
That's fantastic.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
So.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Funny.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Okay, that's it.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.920
Darknight in chat, by the way, suggests a Phantasy Star universe or Guild Wars.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.120
PSU is crap.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.280
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:12.000
I suggest if you're going to play one of the Phantasy Star MMOs, go for Blue Burst because

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.120
it's a lot better and you can actually use a force in that game without having to retardedly

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:17.120
crap it.

01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.120
Crap it!

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.640
Darknight says, stop hatin'.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.800
I can hate all I want to.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.800
It's a free country.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.800
I want to play a better game.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.800
That was great.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.760
Shane says to play a better game.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:34.160
So he wants our Wii codes, but we'll have to put them back up.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.280
Anyway, I can't read any more of this email.

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.560
I'm sorry, Solar Wing.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.560
Was that the last email?

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.080
Yeah, that was the last email.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.080
Hooray!

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.080
We can move on with the show.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.520
Hooray!

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520
Let's see here.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.040
I mean, you should email us sometime.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.040
Mailbag at orangeontario.com.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.840
We'd love to hear from you, just not all in the same week.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.840
I'll email us.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.840
It will be.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.840
Jamie is awesome.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:02.400
Well, anyways, now I have news on an upcoming retro compilation now.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.440
I know you might be going, ugh, retro compilation, who wants that?

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:11.800
Well, this is the Atari Classics Evolve, and I think this is kind of how you do a retro

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.640
compilation.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:20.520
Not only do you get eleven classic Atari arcade titles, like Asteroid Battlezone and stuff,

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:28.560
in both the original and evolved versions, but you get sixty Atari 2600 classics.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:32.120
That's right, seventy games in one.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.120
Hell yeah.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.120
That's a lot of games.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.240
That is a lot of games.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:39.080
I want seventy versions of Metal Slug.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.960
There probably will be someday.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.840
Give it time.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.840
One day.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:44.840
One day.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:53.240
But some of the eleven evolved classics in it, they are seeing, let's see here, Yars

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:58.400
Revenge, Night Driver, Canyon Bomber, Crystal Castles.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.800
Crystal Castles is great.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.040
Crystal Castles is pretty rad.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:06.000
But I don't know, I feel like a lot of these classics, I've already played Death elsewhere.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I don't know.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.280
I don't know if I can get that excited about it.

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.440
Oh, I'm sorry, those weren't the evolved titles.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.280
Those are just some random titles they were saying.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.920
Can I play over the internet or with other people?

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:21.120
You can play with other people Wi-Fi, and they also have an online leaderboard.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.120
What else?

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.400
Actually, it says, oh yeah, you can just compare scores.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:29.920
I was going to say, hopefully it has it over the internet.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:35.560
The evolved titles, I guess, Asteroids, Asteroids, Deluxe, Battlezone, Centipede, Lunar Lander,

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:41.040
Millipede, Missile Command, Super Breakout, Tempest, Warlords, and Pong.

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.480
Wow, super evolved Pong.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.480
I can't wait for that.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.480
Hey, they had Tempest in there.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.480
Yeah, Tempest is cool.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:52.400
I saw you playing Space Giraffe earlier, Miklotov, while we were done, so what did you think?

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.560
I couldn't tell if it was really a game or an interactive screensaver, because I didn't

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.360
know what I was doing most of the time.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:02.040
It's just really, really colorful, and it wasn't fun.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.160
It's hard to see a damn thing in it, isn't it?

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.080
There's like the one enemy that's really easy to see, and then everything else is just the

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:12.200
background that apparently hurts you sometimes.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:19.360
All right, well, how about, speaking of lists, there's some new tracks that are coming out

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.680
for the upcoming music games Rock Band and Guitar Hero 3.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:30.680
Guitar Hero 3 has gotten some international tracks and some tracks from all around.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:38.840
Ten new songs were announced this week, including Ruby by the Kaiser Chiefs, Radio Song by Super

01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.520
Bus, and Minus Celsius by the Backyard Babies.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.320
I've not heard of a lot of these bands, but apparently it's some more international flavor,

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.320
so hooray for diversity.

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.440
Wait, wait, wait, what was the first one that you mentioned?

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.440
Kaiser Chiefs.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.640
That's the only one I've heard of from the list.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:52.640
No, that you mentioned.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.640
Sorry, it must have been the second one then.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.640
Oh, hell.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.880
Yeah.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:58.880
I closed the list.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:15:59.880
Don't worry about it.

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:00.880
Super Bus.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:01.880
That was it.

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.880
That's pretty cool.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:03.880
All right.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:09.680
Now coming to Rock Band, some songs you might know a little more in-depth stateside, such

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:15.320
as the Rolling Stones with Gimme Shelter, The Clash, Should I Stay or Should I Go, Smashing

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:20.440
Pumpkins with Cherub Rock, Nine Inch Nails, The Hand That Feeds, Beastie Boys, Sabotage,

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.600
and one of my favorites, Radiohead with Creep.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:29.700
Because I'm a creep, I'm a winner.

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:33.080
I'm not playing Rock Band with you on that song, if you're going to take the mic and

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.080
do that.

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.320
You know what I think would be better than Creep for Radiohead songs?

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.320
My Iron Lung.

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.320
What?

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.320
How about Fake Plastic Trees?

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:41.320
No.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.320
That's not a Rock Band song.

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.320
It's not a Rock Band song.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.320
I just like that song.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.320
Radiohead.

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:46.320
It's emo.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.320
It's emo at its finest.

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.120
But My Iron Lung is like a perfect combination.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.760
Anyway.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.560
I like Cherub Rock in the game.

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.560
I like Smashing Pumpkins.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.720
Well, Smashing Pumpkins is cool, I guess.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:03.080
So speaking of Guitar Hero 3, though, moving on to other games that are trying to be like

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:10.100
other games, Guitar Hero 3 is going to have a demo inside the Xbox 360 version of Tony

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.720
Hawk's Proving Ground.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:18.800
It actually will be released in the UK on October 9th, and the demo will be included

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.300
with it before it makes it onto Xbox Live.

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:29.160
So they're saying that what's going to be listed is Laid Down by Priestess, Even Flow

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:34.760
by Pearl Jam, The Metal by Tenacious D. I love Tenacious D. Hit Me With Your Best Shot,

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:41.360
As Made Famous by Pat Vanitar, and a cover of Rocky Like a Hurricane.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.560
What are the scorpions doing anyway?

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.360
Why can't they just use the tracks?

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.360
Stinging people?

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.360
No.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.360
God.

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:57.560
Well, that's great news, but here's something even funnier.

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:06.040
In the ongoing battle between Sony and, I guess, PSP hackers over firmware control,

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.320
who will dominate?

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:13.580
I think the hackers may have actually launched the final blow.

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:19.320
There is a brand new application being released out there called Pandora's Battery.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:25.360
What this is, actually, say for example you have a PSP that got fucked up and broke, and

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.080
you send it back to Sony.

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:31.840
The way they reset them is they have a Sony battery that triggers the PSP to go into a

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:37.240
service mode, and then they can reset the whole thing, and away you go.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.560
Well, this does something very similar.

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:44.640
It allows you to hack the battery's firmware to actually create your own debug battery,

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:53.280
so with that and a combination with a PSP memory stick, you can downgrade, you can unbrick

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:59.680
any PSP, no matter the firmware, so that's pretty awesome.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.760
It will downgrade anything to 1.5.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:07.760
If you have a bricked PSP from failed whatever, it will fix it.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.920
Now how much is this puppy going to cost?

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:10.920
Nothing.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:11.920
It's free to download.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:12.920
Yeah.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:16.160
I mean, you download the program, you run it on your PC.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.240
All you need is a PSP battery to create this debug battery.

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:27.220
You can turn the battery back to its normal mode afterwards, if you'd like.

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:31.320
The only thing you will need, though, is to create this device.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:36.160
You will need one of the custom firmwares, but if you have a friend that has that, you

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.040
create this, and then you're good to go on any PSP.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.040
Hooray!

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:42.040
Kid Icarus on my PSP again!

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.040
Yay!

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.040
Who knows?

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:51.840
This will be interesting when the new PSPs come out, the Slims, but then again, I think

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.760
if you downgrade it, you're going to lose all that video out capability.

01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.760
Time for a new firmware.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:58.760
Interesting.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.280
It's always interesting to see kind of the back and forth between the hacking community

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:07.360
and then the official stuff, and I can understand Sony wanting to stop the piracy and people

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:13.040
posting the games on the internet and all that stuff, but show a little homebrew love.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.040
Little bit.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.040
Little bit.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:19.080
All right, anyhow, moving on to a title that was creating a lot of news in recent weeks

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.020
on the program, Manhunt 2.

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:25.000
A lot of folks thought this game was dead in the water, it's going away, no more are

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.640
we going to see this because you just can't fix the game down from an AO rating.

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:31.640
Well guess what?

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:36.940
It has been modified down to an M-rated version, and Manhunt 2 will be out on the PlayStation

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:42.520
2, PSP, and Wii on Halloween, October 31st, 2007.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:44.840
What a hilarious day to release this game.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.840
Awesome.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:49.400
A quote from Rockstar founder and president Sam Houser, quote, Manhunt 2 is important

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:53.600
to us and we're glad it can finally be appreciated as a gaming experience.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:58.320
Manhunt 2 is a powerful piece of interactive storytelling that is a unique video game experience.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.840
We think horror fans will love it.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.960
Nowhere though has it been said what exactly they had to change.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:09.600
I mean, obviously they've scaled down some of the violence, perhaps, but as to specifics,

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.560
your guess is as good as mine.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.120
They added bunnies.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:18.920
I hope all they did was submit a different video to the ESRB, because-

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:22.100
Well they have to play the game, don't they now?

01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:27.760
When I was still at Konami, we still just did videos, so who knows, I hope they don't

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:30.840
have to cut anything because I want that game.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.920
What they did is they changed all the blood to sweat- Or all the blood to fire, remember,

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:39.020
because it's okay to burn people alive, it's just not okay to have them bleed.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:42.720
But there will be a secret blood code in the game that will restore all the blood from

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.720
the original demo.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:46.440
As will unlock a sex mini-game as well.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:51.220
Yes, and you can use your game genie to change the colors of the sweat as well to make the

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:55.240
experience that much more realistic.

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.240
But sweat is great.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.240
It is.

01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.040
You know what I always thought was funny is that, because I've got the Samurai Shodown

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:06.280
2 out of the Japanese cart for my Neo Geo, if you switch it from Japanese to English

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.520
mode the blood changes color.

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.480
I'm not even joking.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:14.160
You have the big spray of sweat, and then you change it as the big spray of blood.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:18.240
If I developed video games, I would actually put a code that changes the blood into sweat

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:23.040
just to be funny, like to make reference to the old school Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.440
That was fantastic.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.840
Okay, anyway, how about something regarding Eidos?

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.840
Okay.

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:32.240
And something that I love, which is Highlander.

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:38.280
Because however many shows are based off of cutting people's heads off.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.280
Not too many.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.160
Not a lot that I can think of.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.160
Buffy, kind of.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.840
That's staking or cutting their head off.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:47.840
One and a half.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:48.840
One and a half.

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:49.840
I agree with that.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.840
I love Buffy.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.360
Angel, not so much because he was a whiny bitch.

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:56.040
Okay, moving forward.

01:22:56.040 --> 01:23:00.440
There is going to be a Highlander game that is going to be...

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.440
Call him.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.440
What?

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.440
Sorry, never mind.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.440
What?

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.480
I was trying to add sound effects, but forget it.

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.480
Stop farting in the microphone.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:10.480
Anyway.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.400
There can be only one.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:14.400
Okay.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:19.120
It will be on PS3, 360, and PC.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:27.160
It's a third person action game that will cross 2000 years from feudal Japan, from Scotland

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:34.720
in the old days, Pompeii, New York in the future, and you go all over the place cutting

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:35.720
off people's heads.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:39.640
Sadly, I think this is going to be timed with a new movie that's coming out.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:43.840
Yeah, they're making another Highlander movie.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.360
I hope that with his face you can end it, because that man is blind.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.360
He almost killed everybody.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.360
Do you understand?

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.840
Stop it, Rob.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:52.840
You can use...

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.400
I am Colonel McCloud of the Clan McCloud.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:24:00.840
I was born in 1518 in the village of Glenfinnan on the shores of Loch Siel, and I am immortal.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:07.880
Okay, my favorite line in the first one is when he keeps calling Ramirez an overblown

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:08.880
haggis.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:15.720
I am Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez, chief metallurgist to King Charles V of Spain, and

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.880
I'm at your service.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.560
Why does he sound Scottish if he's Spanish?

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.560
I love Spanish.

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.560
It also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head.

01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:22.560
The head, which is this time, has no name.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.560
I know his name.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:41.040
His name is Mr. Heady.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:49.160
You play Owen McCloud, and you fight 77 other people, and you have 18 missions so far.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:54.940
You get to play with zip wires, daggers, free falls, swan dives.

01:24:54.940 --> 01:25:00.160
It will be pretty gory, pretty mature.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:08.360
And also, you have a choice of three weapons, like a tana, claymore, or a, I guess, double?

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:09.360
On the Wii?

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.360
On the Wii?

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.360
I can actually slice people's...

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.360
It's like, well, I said from the beginning, PS3 360 or PC?

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.360
Doh.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.240
But you also get powers.

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.200
I don't remember any of them having actual powers.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.200
Alright.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:23.480
Other than, oh my god, I sense danger.

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.560
It's another immortal.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.860
Let's kill him.

01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:26.860
Alright.

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:29.880
Well, let's go ahead and take a quick break.

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.720
This segment's ran on long enough, that's for sure.

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:34.280
We're gonna take a quick break, and when we come back from this break, more of Orange

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:38.840
Launch Radio with our part B. We're gonna talk a little bit about Metroid Prime 3, a

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:44.760
little bit about Super Mario Galaxy, the penny arcade game for Xbox Live Arcade, and a list

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.960
list for tonight.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:50.960
Oh boy, we'll be right back with more after this of Orange Launch Radio.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:55.360

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.360
