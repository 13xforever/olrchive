Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, August 19th, 2007, the Wii and the 360 are the same price in one country,

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Guitar Hero 3 gets a little poisoned, and is a Wiimote coming to the Playstation 2?

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-host, Dark Sakura.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Hi.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
How are you doing, Miss Jamie Summers?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
I'm here.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
You're here? You're alive and well?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yes, quite.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
All is good in the hood?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
And not hungover.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Yes, I got to watch Dark Sakura get drunk last night.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
I'll drink everybody.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
And no hangover?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
No hangover.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Amazing.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Do you remember what you drank? Can you run down real quick?

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes, I can. I had a shot of cold sake. I had 28 ounces of Kirin beer.

01:14.000 --> 01:24.000
I had six martinis, two of them being pom-tinis, one key lime pie, and Adam and Eve, because it was very tasty, it was apple.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
I had a guavatini. I had, what was that? Oh, God, I can't remember the first one. The chocolate martini.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
And then I had a shot of Glenlivet scotch.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
And then I had some of that amaretto sour and tried a bunch of everybody else's drinks.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
So a lot. A lot.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Oh, yeah. I know that's exactly what I had.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Now, just a note to the kiddies out there. Jamie didn't drive.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
No, I passed out in the back of the car.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
She's over the age of 21. I drove. I didn't really drink anything. So if you're going to drink, you have to drink responsibly.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Lecture, lecture, lecture.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
And drink a lot of water when you do.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
That's right. All right. Also joining us, say hello to Loki.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Hello.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Who did not join us last night.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
No, I did not.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
All right. That's all right. You weren't invited because it was a bachelorette party, so straight men don't get to go to bachelorette parties, unfortunately.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Rob went to mine.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
But he's a straight man.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I know. I was saying you went to mine. I invited you.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
I was like, by the way, my boyfriend got very, very drunk last night, and yeah, Jamie definitely out drank him.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I'm like next to nothing.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Out drank him. Anyway, nobody cares. They want to hear the video game chat.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
Loki, what did you do last night? Maybe it was something gaming related.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
Uh, no. Instead, I went and saw the movie Superbad, and it was awesome.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Was it good? I don't know.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I loved it.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
I haven't seen, like, I think I saw, like, three-fourths of the 40-year-old virgin. I just never finished it, and then I didn't see that knocked up.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
I wouldn't even compare it to it. It's not even anything like that. It's more like American Pie, but less retarded.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
If you've ever seen Knocked Up...

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
You should put that on the poster. It's American Pie, but less retarded.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
Well, if you've seen Knocked Up, it kind of has that same vibe to it. I mean, there's a lot of, you know, crude jokes and stuff like that,

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
but it's still very, you know, you don't go into it like, there's no real gross-out moments or anything like that.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
It's just kind of, you can relate to it, I guess.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
This is like freshman year type American Pie?

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
No, this is like, this is like, it's almost, the premise is almost like American Pie. They're trying to get laid.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
You know, this is the last party that they're going to be able to go to before, you know, they're in college,

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
and they're just trying to basically get alcohol for this party and stuff and hook up with these two girls,

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
because, I don't know, they, I guess they want to be...

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Men.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Well-versed by the time they get to college.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
That don't happen.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
It was a good movie, and there's a lot of funny stuff in there.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
So it wasn't like a gross-out comedy?

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
No, it wasn't a gross-out comedy, and they didn't really have any gross stuff in there.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Like, I didn't think that scene where the guy screwed a pie was that funny.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
It was stupid.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
That's stupid. No one does that. Nobody does that.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
All right, well, let's go to the chat.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Our always present fourth guest is our chat room chat.orangelauntrady.com.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Lots of talk.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Jaded says, no, we don't want to hear the video game chat.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
We want to hear the drunken people chat.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Well, I don't know. Some of our podcast subscribers might disagree with you,

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
so we will get to game chat very soon.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
But, you know, I mean, you can read about the news pretty much anywhere on the internet,

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
but we like to put our personal touch on things and hear from you guys.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
That's why we always invite you guys to chat.orangelauntrady.com.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
RossdielUT says, crude jokes does not equal good comedy.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
And Sephiroth1215 says, super bad was okay. I was laughing the whole time.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
There you go.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
And especially, you know, there's a whole...

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
I don't want to ruin it, but there's a part where you find out that one of the characters had a really bad habit

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
in, like, when he was growing up, and it had to do with doodling things,

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
and that part, it's super funny when they show it, and then after the credits,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
there's more of that stuff, and it's hilarious.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Now, okay, so to bring things back to video games and we transition to how was your gaming week,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
could there be a super bad video game?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Because, you know, as movies do very good, sometimes they get turned into video games.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
There's not. There's a Napoleon Dynamite game coming out.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I was just thinking, I was like, speaking of things that jump the shark,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I'm really surprised there's not a Napoleon Dynamite game.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
There is.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Really?

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
It's DS and PSP, and it looks stupid. Horrible.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Sweet.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
It's like, I mean, it's not even coming out remotely.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
It's not like an anniversary of that movie or anything like that.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
It's just, oh, by the way, we decided, you know, let's make a movie for this,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
or a game for this that's, you know, years after the movie.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Oh, if there's one thing.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Gosh.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
If there's one thing I really hate, it is video games based on shitty movies that shouldn't be turned into video games.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
They should do Xanadu the game.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Now, that might be okay, actually.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
But it has to be all animated by Don Bluth.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
Because sometimes when movies are so bad, they're kind of good.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Like Showgirls the game, I'd buy that.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
There's a Betty Boop game coming out in fucking October.

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
It's like, come on! Seriously, you missed the boat a long time ago with that.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Aren't we past the 1930s high?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
It's like no one watches Betty Boop anymore.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Tell that to Timeless River.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Alright.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
But that was Disney.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Alright, let's get into a little bit of how was your gaming week.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
It was Final Fantasy-ish.

06:21.000 --> 06:27.000
Because I played Final Fantasy Advance 6 in your car a little, to show it to you.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
And I played at the gym.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
I beat the first area, the first town, in the gym.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Which means you have like 49 more hours to go.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Shit.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
But it's not Pokemans.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
No, I love Final Fantasy 6.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
I mean, obviously, many people will tell you.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
You know, most people would say the best Final Fantasy game ever was either 7 or 6.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Two. Japanese 2 or English 2?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Japanese 2 or 5.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Really?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I like the job systems.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Yeah, I'll give you that.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
I don't know.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
I still have a soft spot for 4.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
But I think that's just because that was my first one.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
You spoon-y bard.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Yes, and you spoon-y bard.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
But anyway.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
But, but, but, but, but, but.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I touched it today.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
What?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Final Fantasy 6?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
No.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
What?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Super Metroid.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
I picked up my Super Nintendo today and was going to pack it up and bring it over here.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
And then Dan informs me,

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Oh, we're lending that to Adam.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Thank God you got it on the second guess, because the third guess wasn't much better

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
for me.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
For the record, I do own Kirby's Avalanche.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
So there.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Alright.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
And Super, I was just saying, Super Metroid comes out on Virtual Console next week, but

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
you were like,

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
No!

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
That was exactly the noise you made when I said it was coming out on Virtual Console.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
You were like,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
No, we're playing the real one.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Even though the emulation on Wii is pretty good.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
We're playing the real one.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
We're going to play the real one.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Jamie and I failed.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Either that or I have to see if my Hori pad will work.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
We failed to have our Super Metroid night, but we are going to have it soon.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
We've said we're going to have it very soon.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Well, they have those pads you can get that are actually converted.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
They're modded real pads that you can plug into, like the classic controller to the Wii,

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
so you can play these games on the actual pads.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
I can just bring my Super Nintendo and play the actual game on the actual system.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
For the people who don't have a Super Nintendo.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
Go to your local flea market and pay $5.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I'm just going to chat and reading some stuff here.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Son of Dad is talking about movie based games.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Remember the Nacho Libre game?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Yes, unfortunately I do.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Thankfully I don't.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I don't think I played that.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
That was on the DS.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
What other crap is coming out?

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
Arctic Tale, which for those who may not know,

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Arctic Tale is going to be a brand new movie, kind of like March of the Penguins,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
except with polar bears and seals.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Or what was the other one they had?

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Happy Feet.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Happy Feet sucked.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
The movie was okay, but the game sucked.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
But at least Happy Feet was not a documentary, though.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
There was singing and dancing in there,

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
so you can kind of turn that into a pretty good game, I guess.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Tiger Claw says, Sky, what about the Alvin and the Chipmunks games?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
It's going to be kind of like Guitar Hero.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Yeah, but Alvin and the Chipmunks, so that's another movie tie-in game.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
It's going to be crap.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Here's the thing.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
The new Alvin and the Chipmunks makes me want to throw up in my mouth.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
When I saw the poster, it looks like crap.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
And I just never liked the original to begin with, to be honest.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
That's not one thing from my childhood I fondly remember.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Dude, Jason Lee.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
I think they were kind of stupid.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Jason Lee is such a sellout now.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
I mean, seriously, what the fuck happened since the View Askew days?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I liked My Name is Earl.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Okay, I don't like that show, but credit to that at least.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
That's a little different, but come on.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
I mean, seriously, Alvin and Chipmunks shit?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
I mean, now we're getting back into movie podcasting.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Let's get back to the games.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Was there anything else you wanted to share?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
My Name is Earl is a TV show.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And the only reason I saw that is because you were there.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
They were watching it at my Fourth of July party.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
The only game that I think this year that's going to be any good

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
that's tied in with sort of a movie,

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
and it's not even really based on a movie, the Simpsons game,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
is going to be fucking awesome.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
That is it.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
That is the only game I'm buying this year that's tied in with a movie.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Oh, wait, except for the Harry Potter game, which I bought that for Nellie, though.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
By the way, do you have to point out what we're discussing in the chatroom right now

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
as the benefits of emulation?

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Because I just said emulation for the lose.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
You know, because I prefer playing the actual game on the actual.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
That's just how I've always been.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
But there is a good point to emulation.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Translated Japanese RPGs.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Seiken Densetsu 3.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
The quintessential translated game you must play.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
Where they went and translated the graphics in the game.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Or Final Fantasy V before Square brought it over here.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
That was the other biggie.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I had a very, very well translated.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Or even I had a translated panorama cotton once.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
That is not very good.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
The other good thing I think about emulation is that

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
for most of us that don't have the big bucks to spend on the real thing,

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
it kind of lets you play the old classic games that time forgot.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Now we have Virtual Console and Game Tap.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Yeah, which is cool.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
And I support both of those, as you know if you listen to the show.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
And the Ninja Pass.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
For any length of my time.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Anything else you want to share for your gaming week?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
No.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I tried to play as much as possible.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
I played Casarone a little bit.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
The demo for that.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
And it's pretty interesting actually.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I could kind of get into it.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
Because I know Nelly's been hooked on Catan.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
And I had to literally drag the 360 to a different room.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
So that I could actually play some games on it.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
So that was pretty cool.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
And then of course the one demo everyone's been playing this week

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
would be Bioshock.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
And I tried that and it's awesome.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
So awesome that I decided to pre-order my game after I played it.

11:45.000 --> 11:52.000
And then, see here, also played some more Beautiful Katamari.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
All three minutes of it.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
And then, let's see, I played Overlord some more.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And that's actually been pretty fun.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
I was pretty surprised.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I thought I'd get tired of the game pretty quick.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
And kind of hesitated to purchase it originally.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
But I'm actually very satisfied with the game.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
It's pretty fun.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
And it's really the game itself.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
You try to be good in it.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
And I think it's harder to be good in the game than evil.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
But after a while, the NPCs just really piss you off.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
And you just go and decide to kill everybody.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
And that's the way you should do it, I think.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
Other than that, I played me and my Katamari on the PSP.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
And tried to remind myself why I hated it on the PSP in the first place.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And that would be the controls.

12:36.000 --> 12:41.000
They suck balls without having a second analog stick on there.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
And then, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

12:45.000 --> 12:51.000
Because for some reason, we're glutton for punishment with that game.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I don't know how this is fucking possible.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
But the game actually glitches in new ways.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
It just progressively evolves into a worse game.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
And I don't know why.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It's just weird.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
It's like a guy's own conscience or something.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It just fucking gets worse.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
And I don't know how.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
But it does.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
And yet, we'll still play it until they release another fucking Grand Theft Auto game that has multiplayer.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
I think that's all I played.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
Oh, I played track and field. Hated.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Do you like it?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Nah, think carefully.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
For me, it's dumb fun.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
I mean, it's totally a brainless type of game, track and field.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
I still haven't bought the full retail one, but I've played the old school one on the computer.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I know it was in the arcade at one time.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah, it was.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I remember playing an arcade one long time ago.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
But they should remake it into the arcade with a DDR pad type thing.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I think that would be a little bit more...

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Like sports bars or something.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Konami has both.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
My Gaming Week.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Not a lot of new stuff to try out this week.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
Obviously, there's Madden, but sports games are typically not my cup of tea, so I passed on that.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
So, just kind of playing the old stuff.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
World of Warcraft.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Boom Boom Rocket.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Oh yeah, I played that too.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
What?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Boom Boom Rocket?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Oh, World of Warcraft.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
How'd that go for you?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
You were here.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Dur.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Anyway, let's see.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
What else did I play?

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Echo the Dolphin I downloaded and tried out on Xbox Live.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
And I have to admit, I thought the game was overrated when I first played it many years ago.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
I think it's overrated now.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I'm not a fan of the Echo series.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
I never understood why people love that so much.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
You're breaking my heart.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
They need Calibri.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm sorry.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
I didn't like Calibri either.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
I played Hexic 2 just to see if the sequel was any better than the first one, because

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
I didn't really care for the first one too much.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
The first one's kind of fun.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
I found the second one to be easier, actually.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
It was weird.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
Really?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
That's a good thing, because the first one is really hard.

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
Yeah, I was able to create a lot of, I don't remember what they are, but basically create

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
some sort of ring thing and it turns into something else.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Yeah, you can tell you play a lot of that game.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I don't like that it's not free, though.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
That's the only thing.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
There's actually something I do need to mention that someone reminded me in the chat room.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
We did have an instance of the M-word in my house as I left.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
What?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Madden?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
The M-word.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Oh my gosh.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Fucking annoying.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
All right.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
We need a real football game.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
Okay, it's not the game that annoys you, I get the feeling, but it's your husband and

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
all his friends coming over and playing, though, that annoys you.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Guess what?

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Later on, think-U-E-A, they decided, guess what, we're going to make two football games

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
a year, so now they're going to have NFL Tour, which is coming out in January.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Can I finish my game of the week?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Sorry.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Can I finish my game of the week?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
That was the sound of the microphone being rammed into my head repeatedly.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Let's see.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
Now, Dark Soccer, your heart is going to break a little more based on chat comments here.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
Gold Banjo says, Echo the Dolphin isn't even worth an emulation download.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Yeah, your mom.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
Sephiroth1215 says, I didn't like Echo, but I really like the Tides of Time.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
Tides of Time was great.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
RawsteelUT says, Echo would be good if it weren't harder than real-life nuclear warfare.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
It wasn't that hard.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Hey, you know what that game really needs instead of being Echo the Dolphin?

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
They made a knockoff game, I think it's actually by the same people that created Echo, called

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Laser Dolphin.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
It was basically-

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Cool!

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
It was Echo the Dolphin with a laser on its freaking head.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
What the hell was that on Xbox Live?

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
It's on PC, but they had like, you know, turtles with rockets on them and stuff.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
It was basically all the sea creatures with different artillery on them.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
I mean, that's the only thing I can think that make that game any better.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Alright, so I instead played demos.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
And here's the thing, like, BioShock, okay?

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Like, I was not getting excited about BioShock at all.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
I'm just like, oh hooray, it's another first-person shooter, looks all sci-fi, doesn't really

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
look like a game I want to get into.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
In fact, I even went and I posted on my Twitter, and I said, because I have a lot of gaming

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
people that I know on Twitter, other independent podcast people, among other things, and I

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
actually made a post on Twitter that said something about like, so what's the big deal,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
oh here it is, so what's so awesome about BioShock?

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
I'm not knocking it, I'm just curious because usually I don't get too excited for first-person

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
shooters.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
And then gamer Andy replied to me and said, frankly, it's the immersive environment jam-packed

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
with atmosphere and the story.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Irrational makes good games.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
And then I'm reading all these reviews, like what, it has like a 99, a Metacritic?

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
I'm like, okay, I've got to see what's so frickin' fabulous about this game, right?

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
So I downloaded the demo, oh my god, it really is that good.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
Like, if the demo is any sign of what the game is going to be, shit, that was a great

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
game.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
That was amazing.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.500
And here's something, okay, that I thought was very interesting, and I observed this

17:39.500 --> 17:43.000
when I was playing, I also observed it when my friend was playing.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.500
When you first, you know, you start off, you know, you crash land your plane and stuff

17:46.500 --> 17:51.500
and the water effects, and you get out of the water, I literally turned around, looked

17:51.500 --> 17:56.240
at the fire in the water, and I stood there and like stared at it for like 30 seconds.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.500
My other friend had played it too, he's just like looking at it, I was like, damn, that

17:59.500 --> 18:01.200
looks really good.

18:01.200 --> 18:05.300
The graphics in this game are hands down like, you know, and I really don't like reviewing

18:05.300 --> 18:10.000
a game based on the demo, so let me say that up front, but I think especially in this day

18:10.000 --> 18:14.400
and age, you can use a demo as a pretty good sign of what's to come for the game.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.600
And I don't think I've seen a better looking game, period.

18:16.600 --> 18:21.160
I mean, the game looks like phenomenal, it's amazing, and it was scary.

18:21.160 --> 18:24.600
I don't know though if I'll end up actually buying the full retail version just because

18:24.600 --> 18:27.340
I'm so horrible at first person shooters.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.840
I'm so bad at them.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.200
I am too, but you know what?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.240
I wouldn't be able to play it.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.240
I purchased it.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.920
I had to get the limited edition so I can get a little, you know, the big daddy for

18:34.920 --> 18:37.020
my desk at work.

18:37.020 --> 18:41.120
But I love the fact that, you know, you could like get fire hands and like set people on

18:41.120 --> 18:44.280
fire, that was so gratifying, I loved it, so.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.880
Bioshock really is that good, like even if you're not a fan of first person shooters,

18:47.880 --> 18:48.880
try out the demo.

18:48.880 --> 18:49.880
It was scary.

18:49.880 --> 18:50.880
It was Silent Hill scary to me too.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.120
Well remember, now two favorite parts for me in the demo.

18:54.120 --> 18:59.800
The one was the chick with the baby stroller, when you walked up to her and she's all talking

18:59.800 --> 19:03.920
about how she turned her baby and stuff into a little sister, and then there was another

19:03.920 --> 19:08.680
one where it was the couple, that kind of reminded me of like a cruise ship, older couple

19:08.680 --> 19:10.360
or something like that.

19:10.360 --> 19:16.960
I mean when you kill the guy whose name is Harold or whatever, the crazy wife comes after

19:16.960 --> 19:17.960
you with a gun.

19:17.960 --> 19:21.680
It was just kind of cool, that whole immersion.

19:21.680 --> 19:27.000
So the game looks, I mean, usually there's a part of me that wants to go, oh it can't

19:27.000 --> 19:28.160
be that good.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.160
It can't be that good.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.440
Why is everybody praising this game?

19:30.440 --> 19:33.960
It really, like you really have to try it, like seriously.

19:33.960 --> 19:41.200
Anyway, going to chat room here, DarVoid says Bioshock demo is fun, Chainsaw Juggling says

19:41.200 --> 19:43.320
it's the best game ever, I can't wait till Tuesday.

19:43.320 --> 19:47.120
Sounds like they're going to have a hit on their hands there.

19:47.120 --> 19:54.000
Joshi16 says damn, I want my Bioshock, interesting.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.480
That was pretty much my gaming week.

19:55.480 --> 20:03.480
One other demo I did try and played a little bit was Beautiful Katamari, which to me, it's

20:03.480 --> 20:10.360
the same fucking game, same fucking game, I don't care, with half the same fucking music,

20:10.360 --> 20:13.600
might I add, in pretty HD graphics.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.680
And you're right, the sad thing is I think there's a part of me that doesn't care either,

20:16.680 --> 20:20.320
I'll probably end up buying the damn game, despite all the drama that happened on this

20:20.320 --> 20:24.900
program because of that game, I don't know, it is still somewhat addicting and I'm looking

20:24.900 --> 20:29.440
forward to multiplayer, but I still kind of look at it with shifty eyes going, did you

20:29.440 --> 20:33.680
have to reuse the same freaking song on the title screen?

20:33.680 --> 20:37.060
And kind of the same gag over and over, I don't know, I'd like to see something a little

20:37.060 --> 20:40.440
bit different, but I'm hoping some of the new modes will make me feel a little bit better

20:40.440 --> 20:41.440
about things.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.440
So, that was that.

20:42.440 --> 20:46.760
Otherwise it was a three minute demo, can't really tell a lot off of that.

20:46.760 --> 20:49.600
Darvoid says it better not be 60 bucks, Katamari.

20:49.600 --> 20:54.040
No, it's like I think 30 or 40, it's like cheap.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.040
That's good.

20:55.040 --> 20:59.340
Nintendo Maniac 64 says, so Sky, is Bioshock the ochre enough time of first person shooters?

20:59.340 --> 21:04.360
I don't, again, I don't want to base my entire opinion of a game off a demo, but it damn

21:04.360 --> 21:06.040
well could be based off of the earlier reviews.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.760
Oh great, time wasn't that great of a game anyways, and I still don't know what everyone's,

21:09.760 --> 21:13.300
I still don't know what the hell everyone's big deal is with that game.

21:13.300 --> 21:17.040
In the Zelda universe, the Super Nintendo, Link to the Past will always be the best one

21:17.040 --> 21:18.040
to me.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.040
Oh yeah.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.040
Always be the best one.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.040
Definitely.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.040
Always.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.040
Always, Jamie, always.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.740
You sound like a maxi pet commercial, Rob.

21:26.740 --> 21:27.740
I hate you.

21:27.740 --> 21:31.560
All right, housekeeping, let's do some housekeeping tonight.

21:31.560 --> 21:35.200
Okay, the only housekeeping we really have tonight is going to affect the live listeners.

21:35.200 --> 21:39.240
We just found out literally five minutes before we went live tonight.

21:39.240 --> 21:43.760
We found out five minutes before we went live, live 365 is shutting down at 8 p.m. tonight,

21:43.760 --> 21:47.040
so that's going to screw some of you live listeners out of some of the perks of listening

21:47.040 --> 21:51.680
live and we apologize, like the bonus segment we do in between and the afterbirth just because

21:51.680 --> 21:52.680
of the maintenance.

21:52.680 --> 21:55.400
We're going to try and cram all the show in before 8 p.m.

21:55.400 --> 21:58.720
We're going to rearrange Skypline a little bit too and do it in the beginning of part

21:58.720 --> 22:02.440
B tonight and not at the end of part B as we usually do, and we're going to cut out

22:02.440 --> 22:06.640
a few segments as well, like the mailbag, just because we got one email this whole week,

22:06.640 --> 22:08.560
so we're going to roll it over to next week.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.800
Mailbag at orangehonorsradio.com, we'd love to hear from you, your comments on the story.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.440
Do you think Bioshock is all that?

22:13.440 --> 22:17.480
I want to hear from people that played the Bioshock demo and didn't like it.

22:17.480 --> 22:22.520
Please speak up because I always love to hear devil's advocate perspectives, so mailbag

22:22.520 --> 22:23.520
at orangehonorsradio.com.

22:23.520 --> 22:26.800
In the language of the week, I want email in as Italian, even though I can't read Italian

22:26.800 --> 22:27.800
for shit.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.540
Just be quiet.

22:30.540 --> 22:32.280
I can still read French.

22:32.280 --> 22:36.280
Alright, so sorry you guys about the downtime tonight, there's nothing we can really do

22:36.280 --> 22:37.280
about it.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.100
We're going to try and finish the show before 8 p.m., but we'll see.

22:39.100 --> 22:45.800
And I wanted to mention, though, podcast awards, they're over, you know, we got nominated,

22:45.800 --> 22:47.760
didn't win, but that's okay.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.440
Congratulations to a cheap-ass gamer cast.

22:50.440 --> 22:51.640
Didn't we announce that last week?

22:51.640 --> 22:52.640
I don't remember.

22:52.640 --> 22:53.960
No, it wasn't over last week.

22:53.960 --> 22:54.960
No, it wasn't over last week.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.040
Well, thank you for remembering.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.640
So congratulations to them.

22:57.640 --> 22:59.920
At least it was another independent podcast award.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.920
Absolutely.

23:00.920 --> 23:04.120
And we've always said, if we can't win it ourselves, it's best another independent podcast

23:04.120 --> 23:05.700
win it, and another one did.

23:05.700 --> 23:06.700
So there you go.

23:06.700 --> 23:07.700
Good job.

23:07.700 --> 23:11.920
And they've had a lot of, like, success this year, too, and a lot of drama with the whole,

23:11.920 --> 23:12.920
like, what, that lawsuit?

23:12.920 --> 23:14.720
Or, no, no, I went on a lawsuit, a subpoena.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.840
The subpoena against them and everything?

23:16.840 --> 23:18.480
Try to get the Circuit City ad?

23:18.480 --> 23:19.480
Foreign members.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.400
It's been a fun year to be a CAG cast listener.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.400
Yeah.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.760
So, good job for those guys.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.240
You know, they're actually up for two awards.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.960
I'd like to see them win the other one they were nominated for, but they don't find out

23:28.960 --> 23:31.840
about the other one until the actual award ceremony.

23:31.840 --> 23:35.280
Well, if any of them are listening, let me just tell you this much.

23:35.280 --> 23:37.560
And I think I can speak for Jamie on this.

23:37.560 --> 23:40.000
The award show is kind of lame.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Yes it is.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.240
It could have gotten better.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.400
They do have good nibbly food.

23:44.400 --> 23:49.640
And I was about, I would have to say, by a distance of a foot and a half, I level with

23:49.640 --> 23:54.000
Adam Curry's butt.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I'm not joking.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.600
And I couldn't really appreciate it properly because he doesn't really have a nice butt

23:58.600 --> 23:59.600
and I had the flu.

23:59.600 --> 24:03.160
Alright, please can we get into game chat now, because I do not want to turn this into

24:03.160 --> 24:05.320
the Adam Curry's butt podcast.

24:05.320 --> 24:09.760
But I will turn it into the Bioshock podcast because I'll be damned if the internet isn't

24:09.760 --> 24:13.240
abuzz about the game this week, so I got a quick story on Bioshock.

24:13.240 --> 24:14.960
You probably heard about this.

24:14.960 --> 24:19.640
Some lucky sons of bitches got the game early thanks to Toys R Us, because Toys R Us was

24:19.640 --> 24:22.760
leaking the game out early, and I think I know how this happened.

24:22.760 --> 24:27.040
They usually put those games out in the glass cases and just don't sell them until the day,

24:27.040 --> 24:30.600
like usually the regular clerks, like no, don't sell this until such and such day, but

24:30.600 --> 24:33.840
they have some type of system where they turn the box around or something, but those games

24:33.840 --> 24:37.840
will sit out there in the glass case for like a week and a half before people can buy them,

24:37.840 --> 24:42.600
and apparently some Toys R Us has just made a big boo-boo and sold the game.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.600
So tons of people are getting this game early.

24:44.600 --> 24:48.720
It's not just Toys R Us, but people I know that do other podcasts that for some reason

24:48.720 --> 24:53.280
get free games sent to them, even though we've never, no, I take that back, we've got a couple,

24:53.280 --> 24:54.640
but we didn't get this one.

24:54.640 --> 24:55.640
There's only one company that loves this.

24:55.640 --> 24:56.640
Lots of Bioshock.

24:56.640 --> 25:00.560
Lots of Bioshock copies floating around out there, and of course, tens of millions more

25:00.560 --> 25:02.960
come Tuesday, so there you go.

25:02.960 --> 25:03.960
Yeah.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.080
DJ Dark Knight says, huge fine.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.080
I don't know, what do you think, Logan?

25:07.080 --> 25:08.800
Do you think Toys R Us would get a fine over this?

25:08.800 --> 25:09.800
I don't think so.

25:09.800 --> 25:16.040
What they'll do is, I don't think it's Toys R Us, like it's not chain-wide, it's just

25:16.040 --> 25:19.200
I think it was one or two stores in Jersey that were doing it.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.720
A couple sloppy managers.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.280
And it's just, you know, it's some idiot, and what they'll do is they'll try to track

25:23.280 --> 25:28.160
it down based on the receipts and stuff, and someone will get in trouble there, and that's

25:28.160 --> 25:29.160
about it.

25:29.160 --> 25:34.800
As long as it's not corporate-wide or something, it's not going to be a huge deal.

25:34.800 --> 25:38.600
They may just get their next game or whatever shipped to them.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.480
They won't get it before street date.

25:40.480 --> 25:44.080
A little slap on the wrist, naughty, naughty.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.080
No cookie.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.920
Yeah, because there's, what, Target and shit.

25:47.920 --> 25:48.920
Target and Walmart are horrible.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.960
Toys R Us is usually the biggest offender when it comes to breaking street date.

25:52.960 --> 25:53.960
Funny you guys say that.

25:53.960 --> 25:57.920
Son of Dad says, for once it's not Target breaking massive street dates.

25:57.920 --> 26:01.000
Joshi16 says, I would laugh if OLR got a free Madden.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.400
Hey, you know what, please, send me one, because...

26:04.400 --> 26:07.700
I would laugh if we did too, because EA's pretty...

26:07.700 --> 26:10.200
Why not give it a fair shot and give the game a fair shot?

26:10.200 --> 26:12.800
I'm not going to hold a grudge against it just because it's a sports game.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.160
It deserves a fair shot just like any other game.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.720
Hey, I'm not saying it's a horrible game either.

26:15.720 --> 26:18.060
I'm just saying I don't care for sports games.

26:18.060 --> 26:19.060
Any sports games.

26:19.060 --> 26:20.060
Alright, anyway.

26:20.060 --> 26:21.060
Moving on.

26:21.060 --> 26:25.280
Anyways, so if you don't have your hands on Bioshock yet, you still can get your hands

26:25.280 --> 26:31.000
on the art book, which is free to download from Irrational Games.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.880
This was something that they were going to try to put into the limited edition pack that

26:35.880 --> 26:43.200
was exclusive to EB and GameStop, but they just ran out of time, so instead they've offered

26:43.200 --> 26:48.140
it for free to download on their website in PDF form, so check it out.

26:48.140 --> 26:52.920
It's Bioshock Breaking the Mold, and it's over 60 pages long.

26:52.920 --> 26:53.920
Cool.

26:53.920 --> 26:54.920
Art books are great.

26:54.920 --> 26:59.720
Now, speaking, though, of computery stuff, you know they were saying, well, at least

26:59.720 --> 27:06.620
IGN PC reviewed PC Bioshock as much better than the Xbox 360 version, saying that it

27:06.620 --> 27:10.360
handled better, the interface was better by using the mouse and the keyboard.

27:10.360 --> 27:13.680
Which if you're playing a first person shooter, hi, duh!

27:13.680 --> 27:15.060
Well now, wait a minute.

27:15.060 --> 27:16.060
Except, except, except.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.060
It's personal preferences, I think.

27:17.060 --> 27:18.140
Here's the classic debate.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.220
Keyboard and mouse versus analog sticks.

27:20.220 --> 27:22.460
I mean, people, it's like...

27:22.460 --> 27:25.080
Depending on how the game, though, is supposed to be played, the functionality of the game

27:25.080 --> 27:32.080
self? Like, okay, what would you rather play Doom on? PC or?

27:32.440 --> 27:39.440
Well, okay, I read their review on Bioshock and their thing was, they're saying, for example,

27:39.800 --> 27:45.400
switching your special abilities using the right mouse button instead of the left bumper

27:45.400 --> 27:50.780
on the 360. To be honest, I don't have trouble hitting the left bumper on the 360, it's not

27:50.780 --> 27:56.600
hard, I just don't get it. It's just nitpicking shit, is what it is. And they're also saying

27:56.600 --> 27:59.240
the hacking is a little bit easier because you can use the mouse instead of having to

27:59.240 --> 28:00.080
use the analog stick.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.400
Well, say it graphically.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.640
Minor shit, that's all it is.

28:03.640 --> 28:07.840
Well, they were also pointing out, though, that you could run it at a 1920 by 1200.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.760
Well, I'm sure you can do it.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.880
If you've got a PC, hi.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.400
If you have an Uber computer that's fast enough to, I bet if I tried to run it at that resolution

28:14.400 --> 28:18.520
it wouldn't be smooth. That's the other problem. I mean, but that's, you know, PC gaming in

28:18.520 --> 28:23.140
general. You usually have to have the most top-end system to play most of the newer games.

28:23.140 --> 28:26.360
Not all. Like, you know, games like World of Warcraft can run on pretty old machines,

28:26.360 --> 28:27.400
but, you know.

28:27.400 --> 28:32.680
But it's meant to be available to a high audience. You know, a broad range.

28:32.680 --> 28:37.400
I'd try it out on PC. I don't know, though. I'm so used to those types of games now with

28:37.400 --> 28:42.360
the analogs, I don't know. But yeah, like Quake 3, I couldn't not play that on a PC.

28:42.360 --> 28:46.520
Like, you know, there's just some games you really get used to. And, you know, if we want

28:46.520 --> 28:48.640
to go the other way around, Final Fantasy XI, okay?

28:48.640 --> 28:51.000
Well, yeah, we did have that issue, didn't we?

28:51.000 --> 28:54.280
Yeah, yeah. Final Fantasy XI was made for a console. It was made for the PlayStation

28:54.280 --> 28:59.160
2, ported to the PC. I can't fucking play that game with a controller for shit. I have

28:59.160 --> 29:00.760
to have the keyboard to play that game.

29:00.760 --> 29:05.760
But I had absolutely no problem playing it with a controller. I started off with that

29:05.760 --> 29:11.160
crappy little gravis pad I got for ten bucks from Dan's GameStop back in the day. And I

29:11.160 --> 29:15.080
was doing all my macros and crap with my trigger buttons.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.960
You know what? Your wiring is backwards, I think.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.440
What?

29:19.440 --> 29:21.960
The games you're supposed to play with a controller you like to play with keyboard and mouse.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.400
The games you're supposed to play with keyboard and mouse you like with a controller. You're

29:24.400 --> 29:25.400
backwards.

29:25.400 --> 29:26.400
No, I'm not.

29:26.400 --> 29:27.400
I'll ask you what it is. Yes, you are.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.400
All right.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.800
That and, you know, it's kind of hard to play Doom without a keyboard because of, you know,

29:30.800 --> 29:34.200
IDDQD and IDBFG and all that.

29:34.200 --> 29:40.760
All right. Let's see. Looking at chat room for comments. Chat.orangelanatrader.com. Sephiroth1215

29:40.760 --> 29:45.960
says, FPS games are usually done in the USA and U.S. companies love to have the best graphics

29:45.960 --> 29:47.920
possible and that's not possible on Wii.

29:47.920 --> 29:52.400
Let's start a little debate there about I'm sure Metroid Prime 3 is coming into the mix

29:52.400 --> 29:55.480
as well now because that game is out, what, next week as well or two weeks?

29:55.480 --> 29:56.480
Two weeks.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.480
Yeah.

29:57.480 --> 30:05.560
Yeah. Let's see. What else is there here? I guess Dark Tetsuya maybe talked about that.

30:05.560 --> 30:10.440
I wish they'd make Red Steel 2 even though they have so much room for improvement.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.360
Lots of room for improvement.

30:13.360 --> 30:17.440
Let's see. Yeah, rostielut says it probably costs three times as much to get a system

30:17.440 --> 30:20.320
that will run Bioshock. Well, we'll see.

30:20.320 --> 30:25.160
All right. Anyway, I'm talking also about the Xbox Live and the PC, you know, things

30:25.160 --> 30:32.640
that are on both. Xbox Live Arcade is going to be on its way to the PC in November. The

30:32.640 --> 30:38.700
secret project name was Vega, not, you know, Street Fighter's Vega but Vega the Star.

30:38.700 --> 30:43.300
It's going to be launching in early November 10 to 20 games in the service and I believe

30:43.300 --> 30:46.900
I saw an early screenshot that had like Galaga as one of the games and of course they want

30:46.900 --> 30:52.140
to expand this with two to four new games every month following the launch.

30:52.140 --> 30:55.780
So kind of not surprising when you consider the Microsoft's been trying to bridge the

30:55.780 --> 31:00.360
gap between the console and the PC but I don't know. I don't know if I'd buy a lot of these

31:00.360 --> 31:04.840
for PC but my question is if I bought it on Live, would I get to download it for free

31:04.840 --> 31:08.320
on the PC? I think I should.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.640
Of course I'm cheap.

31:10.640 --> 31:14.060
The other thing too I'm wondering is it's going to be a little bit of a harder sell

31:14.060 --> 31:19.680
to sell some of these PopCap games that are free online on the PC.

31:19.680 --> 31:24.760
Yeah, but even PopCap like charges, you know, extra money for a downloadable version with

31:24.760 --> 31:28.060
more features. That's where they make their money because whenever you play one of those

31:28.060 --> 31:32.460
games online, they're always saying download the trial version of the Uber version of this

31:32.460 --> 31:37.240
game with more levels and more colors, woo, and all that.

31:37.240 --> 31:40.620
I think what's also interesting about the whole thing is that the 150 megabyte size

31:40.620 --> 31:44.400
limit still applies even to the PC games. That's kind of interesting to me, I don't

31:44.400 --> 31:45.400
know.

31:45.400 --> 31:53.360
Well, I don't know. Anyways, maybe, well actually the 150 meg limit maybe that does tie into

31:53.360 --> 31:56.440
something that they're going to be able to be transferred back and forth or something.

31:56.440 --> 31:59.040
I don't know. I would hope so. Maybe later on or something.

31:59.040 --> 32:07.600
Okay, so this is not a big surprise but apparently the news got out that Xbox or Microsoft is

32:07.600 --> 32:16.840
just saying is allowing certain MMOs to require hard drive space and require the use of the

32:16.840 --> 32:22.920
Xbox 360 hard drive. Duh, I mean Final Fantasy XI, hello, I mean. But apparently what they're

32:22.920 --> 32:28.640
saying is that each title will create a master storage file, one file per title per console

32:28.640 --> 32:33.760
or something like that. And apparently on the box it will say, you know, such and such

32:33.760 --> 32:35.560
storage is required.

32:35.560 --> 32:38.520
Even though XI didn't say that, did it? Well I guess it had to have said it somewhere.

32:38.520 --> 32:43.160
It must have because you had to install it to your hard drive, so. I don't know, I'm

32:43.160 --> 32:48.520
not surprised that MMOs require this. I'm just surprised that normal games haven't gotten

32:48.520 --> 32:52.760
this yet. I still think that that is coming, whether they're saying it or not.

32:52.760 --> 32:57.240
The most shocking thing about that story to me, I was like, there's MMOs in development

32:57.240 --> 33:02.720
for the 360, awesome. Wasn't there that Marvel MMO or something that was coming out to them?

33:02.720 --> 33:06.480
That would be awesome, I'll play that. I don't remember that. I'm like, what MMOs are in

33:06.480 --> 33:10.760
development for 360? I'm just totally spacing it. I know I've heard of something, but I

33:10.760 --> 33:15.760
just, I can't remember. Like what is in development for 360 as an MMO? Well, I don't know. People

33:15.760 --> 33:20.080
go play Phantasy Star Universe. Oh my God, World of Warcraft, it must be true. World

33:20.080 --> 33:24.000
of Warcraft is coming to 360. Oh, shut up. World of Warcraft is never coming to 360.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.920
Leave it on the damn PC. Ragnarok 2. Now that would be sweet. Yeah, I've been trying to

33:28.920 --> 33:34.800
get the, I have to have a Korean social security number apparently. Sucks. Well, no, there's

33:34.800 --> 33:38.480
ways of getting around it, but I've been trying to play the Ragnarok 2 demo. Wow. You're gonna

33:38.480 --> 33:42.920
have to kidnap a Korean child. There's other ways to do that, I don't want a Korean child.

33:42.920 --> 33:47.640
Oh, DJ Dark Knight has a good point. Phantasy Star Universe is also another MMO on the 360.

33:47.640 --> 33:54.440
That's what I just said. In fact, the add-on comes out this fall for it if people are still

33:54.440 --> 33:59.040
playing that game. Guess who quit? Ah, that'd be me. I know. I don't know, so I... There's

33:59.040 --> 34:03.520
Julie, she's fully addicted to PSU. There's a part of me that wants to go back to PSU,

34:03.520 --> 34:08.000
but not until I hit 70 in WoW. I hit 64 yesterday, so I'm getting close. The part of me that

34:08.000 --> 34:15.400
wants to go back to playing PSU has been sporked in the head and buried in a deep pit. PSU

34:15.400 --> 34:20.800
wasn't that bad. I had fun with it. I'm glad you did. Thank you, Rob. But there's more

34:20.800 --> 34:28.920
fun, better fun. Wait, hold on, I gotta say, Dark Tetsuya says, find at. Did you hear about

34:28.920 --> 34:32.520
the baby this week? That's mine in Korea. Oh, that was China. That's China. Get your

34:32.520 --> 34:37.400
countries right. Get your Asia right, Dark Tetsuya. God, really. That was still kind

34:37.400 --> 34:43.800
of funny. A little funny, even if it was wrong, it was funny. I know. You know what, read

34:43.800 --> 34:50.040
the news, people. Go on Yahoo, instead of reading about celebrities in the Paris Hilton

34:50.040 --> 34:54.840
stupid ass, read World News. Well, what if I like to read about celebrities? Like, Perez

34:54.840 --> 34:59.720
Hilton is like in my day. Like, I always say, okay, you gotta visit Kotaku and Destructoid

34:59.720 --> 35:06.080
and Joystiq and Perez Hilton. That's basically how I, you know. Okay. I surf the net every

35:06.080 --> 35:13.360
day. I go to Yahoo News, and then I go to CNN.com, and then I read my live journal.

35:13.360 --> 35:16.800
No one cares about our browsing habits. Go to the next story. And then I go to Porno

35:16.800 --> 35:20.420
too. While SteelUT apparently needs an explanation,

35:20.420 --> 35:24.160
some people in China wanted to name their child At, because I think, what, they meet

35:24.160 --> 35:28.440
by email or something? And At is pronounced like Achi or something.

35:28.440 --> 35:31.560
I stopped caring five minutes ago. Which means love him or something. Why don't

35:31.560 --> 35:38.640
they just use the actual, you know, symbols for that. Anyway, so whatever. How about something

35:38.640 --> 35:45.080
that should excite some of our more emo people? My Chemical Romance is going to be in Guitar

35:45.080 --> 35:52.720
Hero 3. They're doing a three pack, I'm sorry, not Guitar Hero 3, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360.

35:52.720 --> 36:01.920
They are doing a three song pack for Xbox Live Marketplace that will have teenagers'

36:01.920 --> 36:09.800
famous last words, and this is how I disappear. It is 500 points, AKA $6.25.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.480
And I believe it's actually up now. They're master tracks, by the way, from the

36:12.480 --> 36:15.800
band. And I believe we have a little clip of those

36:15.800 --> 36:22.040
songs. So, cause, like, well, you know, cause, because, like, I have no idea who my, well,

36:22.040 --> 36:24.040
I know who they are, but I don't really listen to these type of bands.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.040
They did one song that I like. I don't.

36:26.040 --> 36:29.480
That was Cemetery Drive. Like, I knew none of these songs.

36:29.480 --> 36:36.480
Say something, Rob. Alright, let's do it.

36:59.480 --> 37:10.000
The chat room is all, like, going, no, no, don't play that, why did you do that, why?

37:10.000 --> 37:14.040
And Sephiroth1215, though, says, hey, I hate emo, but the Black Parade is very good.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.720
I don't know, I thought the songs were kind of melodic.

37:16.720 --> 37:22.000
They seem to fit in Guitar Hero 2. I mean, I don't get into the whole emo versus

37:22.000 --> 37:26.880
punk versus whatever else, I don't know. At least you got some new fucking tracks

37:26.880 --> 37:29.680
to download for Guitar Hero 2 that are not Guitar Hero 1.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.560
Amen, there you go. Can't we all agree that that's a good thing,

37:32.560 --> 37:34.640
even if you don't like the particular band they picked?

37:34.640 --> 37:37.480
There you go. Good job.

37:37.480 --> 37:42.800
Alright, well, speaking of Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 3 is going to be getting Slash.

37:42.800 --> 37:47.320
You already knew about that, but they're also going to be having Bret Michaels, if you can

37:47.320 --> 37:50.680
believe it. Bret Michaels is going to be using his face

37:50.680 --> 37:54.160
and his image in the game, just like Slash, and then, of course, in the game, you gotta

37:54.160 --> 38:00.940
get some Poison songs, Talk Dirty to Me by Poison, and go that far from the Bret Michaels

38:00.940 --> 38:03.600
band. So, pretty cool, you can look forward to those

38:03.600 --> 38:06.800
songs in Guitar Hero 3. Unfortunately, we do not have clips of those

38:06.800 --> 38:09.800
songs because I was too lazy to pre-arrange that before the show.

38:09.800 --> 38:13.440
Well, way to go, Rob. My bad.

38:13.440 --> 38:19.360
Anyways, if you happen to be living in Australia, you'll be happy to know that the 360 core

38:19.360 --> 38:25.880
has now been price-dropped to compete with the Wii, is now the same price as the Wii,

38:25.880 --> 38:35.880
and of course, coinciding with that, the 20GB system has also been dropped down to $579.95

38:35.880 --> 38:45.920
Australian, so that's pretty awesome as well. Well, I don't know, dropping the core system

38:45.920 --> 38:50.360
down to where the Wii is, not good enough, I still think.

38:50.360 --> 38:55.880
Well, I don't know, I think it's interesting precedent, I wonder if that's going to happen

38:55.880 --> 39:00.360
over here eventually, where the 360 will get cut back enough, where it can compete with

39:00.360 --> 39:03.000
the Wii like that, but I don't think it'll happen anytime soon.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.920
I think it's also a matter of the markets themselves that want to make it competitive

39:07.920 --> 39:12.120
for the market it's in. Or is it just that Nintendo kind of likes

39:12.120 --> 39:16.160
to screw the people that aren't in Japan or the U.S. by charging more for their systems,

39:16.160 --> 39:21.520
because you know, doesn't the DS and the Wii cost way more? I guess most systems cost way

39:21.520 --> 39:27.640
more in Europe and Australia, Canada. Again, the other thing has to do with what

39:27.640 --> 39:31.520
the general cost of living is and how it relates to that particular area.

39:31.520 --> 39:35.960
I don't think it's actually a very fair comparison to compare American dollars to other currencies,

39:35.960 --> 39:40.080
when it depends on exactly how the currency works within the area it's from.

39:40.080 --> 39:45.640
I'll give you that. Because as far as I know, it's not spending

39:45.640 --> 39:51.820
a whole bunch of money in Europe. But it still creates an interesting choice

39:51.820 --> 39:56.720
when they are the same price in that currency, the Wii and the 360, it's kind of a different

39:56.720 --> 40:01.680
competition that it is here in that regard. But at the same time, if you want to argue

40:01.680 --> 40:07.040
it I guess, that you would need to still buy a memory card in order to be able to save

40:07.040 --> 40:13.240
your games and stuff, versus the Wii, which has built-in memory, although it is extremely

40:13.240 --> 40:17.360
limited. Yeah, and you can't really download a lot

40:17.360 --> 40:20.480
of videos with that. I forgot to mention, I did hear some interesting

40:20.480 --> 40:22.200
news actually. Oh really?

40:22.200 --> 40:27.400
Well not surprising, but the 64 meg memory unit for the 360 is going away.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.240
Really? Yeah.

40:29.240 --> 40:31.160
Where'd you get that? From Microsoft.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.040
Places? Oh, I see.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.280
Okay. Alright, well there you go.

40:35.280 --> 40:39.520
Alright, well moving on. Well, for anyone who has been keeping up with

40:39.520 --> 40:46.800
Sega, there was a rumor going around that they were doing a viking game called Vikings

40:46.800 --> 40:54.320
Battle of Asgard, and GameStop has actually stopped listing the PS3 and Xbox 360 version

40:54.320 --> 41:01.960
of that on their forthcoming games, and it was to be released in February 2008, but Sega

41:01.960 --> 41:05.960
is not saying anything about it. I mean, they could say something when it comes

41:05.960 --> 41:13.160
up to the convention coming up, but other than that, they're nuh-uh.

41:13.160 --> 41:17.480
No hairy vikings! No fjords.

41:17.480 --> 41:21.320
Wasn't there an old school PC game called Vikings or something like that, or what was

41:21.320 --> 41:24.920
something else? I think it was the lost vikings or something?

41:24.920 --> 41:27.200
Yeah, the lost vikings. Was that what it was?

41:27.200 --> 41:28.680
I don't think this is a remake of that. I think it also had a version of the Super

41:28.680 --> 41:30.200
Nintendo, didn't it? I think it did.

41:30.200 --> 41:34.480
Yeah. Alright, anyway, completely different note

41:34.480 --> 41:41.280
on Xbox Live Arcade. Apparently, they are developing Crazy Frog Racer?

41:41.280 --> 41:45.800
They're porting it, yeah. Is Crazy Frog Racer already out on PC or something?

41:45.800 --> 41:47.640
It's in the UK. Oh my lord.

41:47.640 --> 41:52.880
And it's crap. Crazy Frog is like one of those franchises that really needs to go away.

41:52.880 --> 41:58.520
Well anyway, the folks, it's Graffiti is the company that's working on it, and the CEO

41:58.520 --> 42:03.680
of Graffiti, Kenneth Hurley, actually said this at a recent announcement, quote, we are

42:03.680 --> 42:08.100
excited to jump in on the Xbox 360 and introduce our title to the millions of gamers around

42:08.100 --> 42:11.840
the world playing on the console. But maybe no one wants to play your damn game.

42:11.840 --> 42:16.200
Everything about that? Oh god, the soundtrack alone is going to make

42:16.200 --> 42:20.880
me want to put a gun in my head. I don't get that Crazy Frog thing at all.

42:20.880 --> 42:25.400
Have you heard the Crazy Frog songs, Jamie? I don't know.

42:25.400 --> 42:29.240
Please have a clip. I will get a clip. I will load a clip right

42:29.240 --> 42:30.760
now. Where's the ferret so I can do it it wrong?

42:30.760 --> 42:33.680
While you do the next story. Do the next story and I will get a clip.

42:33.680 --> 42:39.760
Alright, well, you may be waiting for a beautiful Katamari to come out in October, but in the

42:39.760 --> 42:46.320
meantime though, you do have that wonderful demo that's available from Xbox Live.

42:46.320 --> 42:51.200
And in case you want to get a little bit more life out of your demo, or just do something

42:51.200 --> 42:58.360
really neat, what you need to do is hold the back and start buttons on your controller

42:58.360 --> 43:04.480
as the demo is booting up on the main screen. And it will allow you to play as either the

43:04.480 --> 43:10.540
Prince or Mag, one of Prince's many cousins. So you can actually play as one of the cousins

43:10.540 --> 43:13.800
in the demo as well. Yay, that's kind of neat.

43:13.800 --> 43:17.720
Yeah, and we actually have a clip of one of the new songs from Beautiful Katamari right

43:17.720 --> 43:37.680
here. You know, if my Xbox, that was Crazy Frog

43:37.680 --> 43:42.160
by the way, if my Xbox started making those type of noises, three red rings of death wouldn't

43:42.160 --> 43:47.920
be enough for what I would do to it. Well, you know what, let's cleanse the palette

43:47.920 --> 43:55.320
a little bit away from Retarded Frog. Smack you the frog. Anyway, for people who are still

43:55.320 --> 44:00.440
playing Lost Planets, guess what? The maps are all free. You can just go get them.

44:00.440 --> 44:08.440
I like free. They're free.

44:08.440 --> 44:13.520
What else is there to say? Free stuff. Go Kat! Yay, free.

44:13.520 --> 44:17.760
I like that whole concept though of releasing map packs in advance for money for the hardcore

44:17.760 --> 44:21.680
people and then free for the rest of us later. Apparently, according to this, you can trade

44:21.680 --> 44:26.240
in your game and rebuy it for 10 bucks at Toys R Us.

44:26.240 --> 44:30.620
What? Because what this says, it says you can rebuy

44:30.620 --> 44:33.240
it at Toys R Us for $9.99. Wow.

44:33.240 --> 44:37.440
Why the fuck would you trade in your game and then rebuy it for 10 bucks?

44:37.440 --> 44:40.240
It's a profit-making thing, I think. I think they're saying you can sell it back for more

44:40.240 --> 44:43.680
and then buy it for cheap. It's a money-making scheme.

44:43.680 --> 44:47.800
Whatever. I think that's with Madden. What it is is

44:47.800 --> 44:52.520
the game is like 20 bucks right now. Let's see. Joshi16 says Crazy Frog Frogger

44:52.520 --> 44:56.040
would be good. Kill him. They actually have Crazy Frog Racing coming

44:56.040 --> 45:00.560
out on PlayStation 2 in two weeks, actually. Kill me now.

45:00.560 --> 45:22.640
Maybe it'll coincide with the Xbox 360 game. Have you ever heard shittier music in your

45:22.640 --> 45:26.000
life? I mean, really? Doesn't this make you want to go and willingly

45:26.000 --> 45:29.560
listen to Britney Spears? It makes me want to go on a car trip with

45:29.560 --> 45:30.560
you. Sorry.

45:30.560 --> 45:36.960
Off a cliff? Hey, I've heard some of the stuff you play

45:36.960 --> 45:40.680
in your car. I disagree with some of it.

45:40.680 --> 45:41.680
Rob. What?

45:41.680 --> 45:46.640
Heart. No, anyway. Let's change the subject. Our chat room's

45:46.640 --> 45:50.560
in pain, and I'm sure many of you are, too. Let's talk about release dates. That's always

45:50.560 --> 45:54.920
a happy subject that will wake us back up and get us all happy again.

45:54.920 --> 45:57.280
Let's go over to Japan first and look at some release dates.

45:57.280 --> 46:01.040
You might remember last week we didn't have a whole lot to report for the Japanese release

46:01.040 --> 46:03.360
date. I hate to tell you, this week's looking pretty

46:03.360 --> 46:05.720
similar. There is a new title on the Nintendo Wii coming

46:05.720 --> 46:13.720
out on the 23rd from Compile, and it's called Sharui Takoran, which looks to be some type

46:13.720 --> 46:21.720
of game where, I don't know. It's by Compile Heart, and this anime-looking

46:21.720 --> 46:24.920
chick is offering up these little octopus-looking cute things.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.760
I don't really know how else to describe it. It's a puzzle game, though.

46:27.760 --> 46:31.720
Tentacle rape? Eh? No, no tentacle rape in this puzzle game.

46:31.720 --> 46:34.080
No, that's what she's offering up. Tentacle rape, eh?

46:34.080 --> 46:37.280
I don't think she's offering tentacle rape, Loki.

46:37.280 --> 46:42.600
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Peer X Cure Recovery is coming out, and there's

46:42.600 --> 46:48.760
also a special set coming out at the same time, and also coming out, Quiz and Variety

46:48.760 --> 46:55.080
Suku Suku in Fuku 2. Moto Suku Suku is coming out.

46:55.080 --> 47:00.400
That's what it's called. Okay, are there girls in school uniforms there?

47:00.400 --> 47:04.760
Now check out this screenshot from Peer X Cure, Loki.

47:04.760 --> 47:15.600
It looks like she wants a suku suku in the uku.

47:15.600 --> 47:19.520
She's showing a little bit of skirt there, hiking up a little bit.

47:19.520 --> 47:22.000
Okay, fuck Peer X Cure. I don't care about that.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.840
I want to see what this suku suku thing is here.

47:24.840 --> 47:29.480
It's a quiz game, though. Quiz and Variety.

47:29.480 --> 47:33.220
I guess it's these cute little chibi bunny things.

47:33.220 --> 47:36.080
Some are dressed as a knight, and some are dressed as little farms guys.

47:36.080 --> 47:39.240
I guess that's Suku, and that's Fuku. I don't know.

47:39.240 --> 47:43.560
Awesome. They're more descriptive terms, because moto

47:43.560 --> 47:47.960
still is more. Alright, also coming out on the Nintendo DS.

47:47.960 --> 47:52.560
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fates, and I'm sure a lot of you guys like your Crystal

47:52.560 --> 47:55.280
Chronicles, so there you go. You have that to look forward to, and that's

47:55.280 --> 47:59.600
probably the biggest game this week. That and suku suku.

47:59.600 --> 48:03.160
Awesome. Anyways, let's see.

48:03.160 --> 48:07.800
In the US, there's some pretty good stuff to look forward to this week.

48:07.800 --> 48:14.320
Just a little game called Bioshock on PlayStation 2, or not PlayStation 2, 360 and PC.

48:14.320 --> 48:17.800
I meant PC for some reason I was looking at a PlayStation 2 game.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.880
OMG, Bioshock's coming to PlayStation 3 after all.

48:19.880 --> 48:21.920
OMG, OMG. OMG, no.

48:21.920 --> 48:25.040
It is not coming to PlayStation 2. PlayStation 2 would melt down if they had

48:25.040 --> 48:29.320
to play that game. On PlayStation 2, though, you can look forward

48:29.320 --> 48:35.320
to two wonderful games, including Metropolis Mania 2 and Brunswick Bowling.

48:35.320 --> 48:41.440
Awesome, hooray. On PS3 and PSP, you're going to be getting

48:41.440 --> 48:46.880
Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, the delayed edition.

48:46.880 --> 48:53.880
Then, let's see, also, let's see here, on PC and 360 as well, another good RPG, Two

48:55.280 --> 49:01.280
Worlds coming out on both platforms, as well as the Two Worlds Collector's Edition.

49:01.280 --> 49:08.280
And, let's see, on PSP, a couple more games, Jean de Arc and Dragonears Aria is also making

49:12.560 --> 49:15.880
its way out. Then, let's see, on the Wii, a whole bunch

49:15.880 --> 49:22.880
of nothing, and of course, on the DS, Brain Age 2, more brain training in minutes a day.

49:25.840 --> 49:29.880
Another game that you'll play for one whole day and then stop playing.

49:29.880 --> 49:36.160
And this one was really interesting, The Settlers is coming out on DS as well, which isn't that

49:36.160 --> 49:40.280
Settlers of Catan, I think? The Settlers? Sounds familiar.

49:40.280 --> 49:45.640
I don't know, I'll be able to look at that. And then, Operation Vietnam, so you too can

49:45.640 --> 49:48.960
have the flashbacks that everybody is jealous of.

49:48.960 --> 49:53.240
All right, that's government money out of. Real quick, before you get to the Europe dates,

49:53.240 --> 49:58.980
I just want to say in chat, Darvoid says that Suku Fuku translates to summer uniform, despite

49:58.980 --> 50:02.200
what you were thinking, sicko. That does look like a summer uniform.

50:02.200 --> 50:08.640
Summer is natsu. Well, whatever, let's just move on.

50:08.640 --> 50:15.640
On the 21st, we have Dragonears Aria on PSP. On the 24th, we have Anno 1701 for DS, Blue

50:16.600 --> 50:23.600
Dragon on Xbox 360, Glory Days 2, Brotherhood of Men on DS, we have Loki on PC, a bunch

50:23.600 --> 50:29.600
of Madden, fuck Madden, MotoGP 07. What's your biggest issue with Madden?

50:29.600 --> 50:33.520
Sucks. I never said, I never, it's the husband and

50:33.520 --> 50:35.960
friends thing. No, I detest American football.

50:35.960 --> 50:37.760
All right, moving on. It's stupid.

50:37.760 --> 50:39.560
I'm not going to argue. Play rugby!

50:39.560 --> 50:42.320
Is Loki coming to Mac? No, it's PC.

50:42.320 --> 50:47.480
That's right, and Loki does not come to Mac. I knew that was coming.

50:47.480 --> 50:49.680
You're funny tonight. Can I continue?

50:49.680 --> 50:54.160
Yes, you may. Thank you, sir. On the 24th, we have Pac-Man

50:54.160 --> 50:58.800
Rally. 24th also is Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced

50:58.800 --> 51:03.800
Warfighter 2 for PS3 and PSP, and 24th is Bioshock.

51:03.800 --> 51:08.360
No, Bioshock. Are you going to hate that, too?

51:08.360 --> 51:15.360
No, if they did a PS2 version, you'd think it would be like Bio Fizz, Bio Zap.

51:15.360 --> 51:21.280
All right. I hope Mr. Bubbles gets a spinoff game. That's all I hope for.

51:21.280 --> 51:24.200
He should have his own Saturday morning cartoonish show.

51:24.200 --> 51:28.960
Mr. Bubbles Happy Hour! There should be a fighting game, Mr. Bubbles

51:28.960 --> 51:31.640
vs. Pyramid Head. Pyramid Head would win.

51:31.640 --> 51:37.760
That would be hardcore. They need to do scary games of the fire.

51:37.760 --> 51:44.160
In a fight, though, between Mr. Bubbles, the Big Daddy and Pyramid Head, Mr. Bubbles, Pyramid

51:44.160 --> 51:48.960
Head, and the licker from Resident Evil. I'm sorry. I would say, though, I think that,

51:48.960 --> 51:53.920
you know, seeing in the demo how fast those, you know, Big Daddies move, and Pyramid Head's

51:53.920 --> 51:56.200
just dragging that shit along. I mean, he's kind of slow.

51:56.200 --> 52:01.040
Yes, but the only way you can kill Pyramid Head is for him to kill himself.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.240
It's true. All right.

52:02.240 --> 52:05.680
You have to beat him until he falls on his spike because he gets so tired of chasing

52:05.680 --> 52:08.040
your stupid butt around. Seriously, what the hell happened to this

52:08.040 --> 52:09.440
show tonight? We're random.

52:09.440 --> 52:12.400
All right, anyway. But I do issue a challenge to anyone who's

52:12.400 --> 52:16.240
working on our Moogan for us. Put Pyramid Head in there for me, please.

52:16.240 --> 52:23.560
And label him P. Hiddy. I forgot about the Moogan thing.

52:23.560 --> 52:27.880
It's P. Hiddy. Well, it was O.L.R. vs. A.G.I., right?

52:27.880 --> 52:32.200
So it'd be, like, you, me, and Loki are all playable characters, and Scott, Mary Young,

52:32.200 --> 52:35.360
and Jessica are all playable characters. Then maybe, like, Bobby B. for good measure,

52:35.360 --> 52:39.360
and we could put one of our people, like Travis Donovan or D.M.N. or somebody can be a playable

52:39.360 --> 52:40.480
character. And then P. Hiddy.

52:40.480 --> 52:48.640
It just shows up. Random boss. He'd be like Noob Saibot.

52:48.640 --> 52:53.320
It'd be smoke. All right.

52:53.320 --> 52:55.760
Moving on. I'm looking at it.

52:55.760 --> 53:01.640
Chat room is very random here. GS68 says, I want Dark Sakura the game, which

53:01.640 --> 53:07.640
would more or less be Burnout O.L.R. edition. You don't know how right you are.

53:07.640 --> 53:11.080
You just totally see her driving down the freeway. Let's see what else is there.

53:11.080 --> 53:16.760
Joshi16 says, Bioshock on the Atari 2600. That'll be interesting.

53:16.760 --> 53:20.520
All right. Anyhow, how about Wipeout on the Playstation 3?

53:20.520 --> 53:23.780
A lot of folks want to see this game, and you might get to see it a little sooner than

53:23.780 --> 53:26.220
later. You might, might, might, might get to see

53:26.220 --> 53:31.840
it at Leipzig. A demo for the Sony Playstation Network release

53:31.840 --> 53:38.160
of Wipeout HD apparently has been rated by the UK's version, I'm sorry, Germany's version

53:38.160 --> 53:42.240
of the ESRB, and supposedly it's going to be at Leipzig Game Convention.

53:42.240 --> 53:44.600
It was already formally announced. We know the game is coming.

53:44.600 --> 53:48.960
It was already said that it was coming at E3 2007, and it's supposed to be released

53:48.960 --> 53:53.920
before the end of the year. Wipeout HD, of course, will have high def.

53:53.920 --> 53:56.160
It's Wipeout for the Playstation 3. What else do you need to know?

53:56.160 --> 54:00.160
Why can't they just release a demo on the Playstation Network since there's hard landing

54:00.160 --> 54:05.480
demos on there in the first place? Because people are really critical of demos

54:05.480 --> 54:08.600
and stuff, and they probably want to make sure that, you know, because even though I

54:08.600 --> 54:11.820
said earlier I wasn't going to base my full opinion of a game off a demo, there's a lot

54:11.820 --> 54:17.080
of people that will, and I'm not perfect either. I've done it before, so.

54:17.080 --> 54:21.120
So there you go. Another interesting thing, apparently Calling

54:21.120 --> 54:28.400
All Cars is going to be transferable to the PSP, at least that's the rumor.

54:28.400 --> 54:37.760
This is coming from a European magazine, PSP, the official guidebook, and no word on if

54:37.760 --> 54:43.840
that's even true or not, but it would be interesting. I don't know.

54:43.840 --> 54:51.680
Maybe sell some more copies on PSP that way. I don't know, is anyone interested in this

54:51.680 --> 54:53.880
game? I know I looked at it and I was like, eh.

54:53.880 --> 54:58.800
I have no idea what you're talking about. I've been ignoring it.

54:58.800 --> 55:06.800
Alrighty then. I mean, is it supposed to be exciting?

55:06.800 --> 55:10.520
Well, the game itself, you know, basically is kind of a cops and robbers type thing.

55:10.520 --> 55:13.320
It's all done in, you know, cartoony cel-shaded and stuff.

55:13.320 --> 55:16.880
Yeah, wasn't that, wasn't actually that an old show?

55:16.880 --> 55:19.400
No. Oh, that was Car 54, Where Are You?

55:19.400 --> 55:20.480
Yeah. That was a cool show.

55:20.480 --> 55:24.080
I think there was a show called Calling All Cars, but I think it has nothing to do with

55:24.080 --> 55:30.200
this, actually. I hear about the game and then it just goes

55:30.200 --> 55:32.840
out of my head. I like the fact that it's transferable.

55:32.840 --> 55:36.080
That's kind of a neat feature. I mean, that's something that Xbox Live is

55:36.080 --> 55:39.640
never going to be able to really deliver because there is no portable Microsoft system yet,

55:39.640 --> 55:41.840
but that's kind of neat. Wait.

55:41.840 --> 55:45.680
I know, wait. Well, for anybody else, though, who's interested

55:45.680 --> 55:52.560
in anything Sony has going on, there are going to be, they've actually got some dates released

55:52.560 --> 55:58.000
from 3Speech for UK. First coming out is Warhawk on the 28th of

55:58.000 --> 56:07.120
August on PSN and 21st September release for Blu-ray.

56:07.120 --> 56:18.120
And also it's going to cost 19.99 pounds at 29 euros.

56:18.120 --> 56:25.600
It will be, let's see, there will be extra video content, a manual and a Bluetooth headset

56:25.600 --> 56:31.760
if you pay the 39.99 pounds to get it on the Blu-ray hard copy.

56:31.760 --> 56:38.160
Heavenly Sword is going to be rumored as the 14th of September with Folklore and Lair on

56:38.160 --> 56:48.200
12th and 26th October, of course, respective. And that's nothing really yet said about SingStar

56:48.200 --> 56:51.640
for PS3. Will you guys be getting Lair at your house,

56:51.640 --> 56:54.340
Jamie? Because I really want to see that game.

56:54.340 --> 56:58.000
We could get it. I mean, we can rent whatever we want to.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Oh, that's cool. Because I'm kind of, you know, I still haven't

57:00.000 --> 57:03.200
bought a PlayStation 3, but there are certain games I really would like to see that, you

57:03.200 --> 57:07.240
know, may change my opinion on PlayStation 3 and finally get one, and that's one of them.

57:07.240 --> 57:09.480
I can't remember if I have Lair on order or not.

57:09.480 --> 57:12.400
I think I'm getting, I know I'm getting Heavenly Sword.

57:12.400 --> 57:16.400
Oh yeah, that too. And then Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of

57:16.400 --> 57:18.820
Destruction. I think by Christmas I'll have finally caved

57:18.820 --> 57:22.680
and buy a PlayStation 3, I think. We'll see.

57:22.680 --> 57:24.920
The longer you wait, the better a deal you're going to get.

57:24.920 --> 57:27.580
That's true. So I'm trying to hold out, and I, well, also

57:27.580 --> 57:30.080
the fact that I just don't have a lot of money right now, so.

57:30.080 --> 57:33.840
And just remember, all the good games you're looking forward to aren't coming out until

57:33.840 --> 57:36.440
next spring at least. True. True.

57:36.440 --> 57:42.320
Anyways, I'll hold up. Well, moving on, let's talk about free, because,

57:42.320 --> 57:46.440
you know, if I can't buy new consoles, then I'm going to get free stuff, because I like

57:46.440 --> 57:50.680
free stuff. One thing that's now free is Ark Lord.

57:50.680 --> 57:55.400
If you are an MMO fan, hopefully you've heard of this game, but if you haven't, Codemasters

57:55.400 --> 58:01.440
Online Gaming has made its online RPG, Ark Lord, completely free to play.

58:01.440 --> 58:04.680
There's an all-new expansion also available for download.

58:04.680 --> 58:09.440
The director of marketing at COG noted, quote, Since its release, Ark Lord has grown consistently

58:09.440 --> 58:13.160
and we are excited to throw open the doors to players across North America and Europe

58:13.160 --> 58:19.720
looking to play a premium, 100% free MMORPG. There's got to be a catch.

58:19.720 --> 58:22.440
What's the catch? There must be a catch.

58:22.440 --> 58:27.800
Is there ads or something? It says, I'm looking at the official website

58:27.800 --> 58:33.520
here, zero fees, download the free game now. I might check it out just for shits and giggles.

58:33.520 --> 58:37.760
I thought that was, someone said that Overlord was based off that game, and I don't think

58:37.760 --> 58:41.560
so, but possibly. The name sounds familiar, or similar, I should

58:41.560 --> 58:44.040
say. Similarish name.

58:44.040 --> 58:47.520
Rasteel UT says, Next week, Ark Lord closes down.

58:47.520 --> 58:54.320
Enjoy it while it lasts. Well, speaking of enjoying it while it lasts,

58:54.320 --> 59:02.320
you may be familiar with a wonderful spin-off into the porno world called World of Warcraft.

59:02.320 --> 59:07.960
Well, guess what? They've decided to move off of World of Warcraft and move into the

59:07.960 --> 59:14.560
ever-expanding realm of first person shooters. Yes, they have just created FPS porn.

59:14.560 --> 59:21.680
Operation Sex, Cock and Load. That is the actual fucking name of this thing.

59:21.680 --> 59:28.600
It is a gaming-themed porn series that is, of course, based off of games like Counter-Strike,

59:28.600 --> 59:33.840
Ghost Recon, and Rainbow Six, and involves a lot of people running around shooting fake

59:33.840 --> 59:41.400
guns and yelling stuff and sex. That's the best combination ever.

59:41.400 --> 59:45.000
That's a list list in the making we need to do next week.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.720
Random things you should have in a porn game. No, what video game should be turned into

59:48.720 --> 59:52.680
porn? Like Biocock. Could be maybe an FPS that comes

59:52.680 --> 59:54.960
out in the future. Cocking Mama.

59:54.960 --> 01:00:01.520
Cocking Mama? What the hell is wrong with you?

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:09.480
Mama will fix it, naughty boy. Okay, I didn't say that.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.160
Attention internet, DarkSakura would like to see Cocking Mama.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:20.320
No! Not me. I was just thinking of names.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:26.320
Looking at comments in the chat room, NintendoManiac64 says FPS, first person sex.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:31.140
No, it's not first person sex, because that's POV sex, by the way.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:34.680
That's a whole different genre. Just stop.

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:38.720
This is actually first person, where they've got the gun and everything, and they're firing

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.800
the gun and reloading it just like you would see in a first person shooter game, except

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.960
they stop and have sex every now and then. Because when you're in the middle of terrorist

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:54.080
warfare, you have to stop and have sex. They have to reload.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:01:00.520
This is so mature tonight. RasteelUT sticks his head in a meat grinder.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.640
Yay, good job. You've got the guy who's always ragging on

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:08.920
us, put his head in the meat grinder. No, I'm just kidding.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:16.080
joshi16 says train your cock in minutes a day. RasteelUT says cooking mama bobbit.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:24.360
Footy in Toronto says Nintendcats in itself is a sex game. Nintendpussy.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:31.820
We are so mature. This show has sunk to the level of dick and

01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:34.920
fart jokes. Congratulations, everybody.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:40.080
You ever remember X-Man and Custer's Revenge? Of course I remember Custer's Revenge.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.600
I haven't played X-Man, but I've heard you talk about it.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.600
Got it. Good times.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.160
All right, let's take a break. That sounds like a good idea, Rob.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.280
This show's getting a little crazy. We're going to take a quick break.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.640
We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.380
