32372	33992	Hello everybody out there on the internet.
34032	36993	Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37073	43655	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43695	46476	And yes, our show is a little bit broken tonight.
46516	52537	I mean, we were off for a week due to a studio move, meaning that the studio we used to record in is no more.
52798	53378	It's gone.
53958	56398	And we're actually in a temporary location tonight.
56679	58039	We call it Studio Loki.
58959	62641	Yes, and it's brought to us by the one and only Techmaster Loki, who's also here on the program tonight.
63261	63901	Yes, it is.
64221	64861	How are you doing, Loki?
65242	69783	I'm doing okay, and I'm still trying to untangle this microphone cord, but that's okay.
69903	70223	That's right.
70263	77566	So if you notice some things are a little bit different tonight, like our opening was not its usual self and some other things, the sound might be a little bit different than what you're used to.
77866	79507	This is why, because we're in our temporary home.
79847	81007	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
102336	103237	Xtifer Xtifer
130909	137151	She should be back next week with us here at Orange Lounge Radio, but I know the listeners and ourselves were all thinking of her and her family this week.
138591	140772	Meanwhile, let's talk about what's going on with the show.
142093	148274	Is that basically we moved, and of course the show taped out of the spare bedroom at the apartment I used to share with Extifer.
148675	152036	Well, we've moved on and Extifer's moved and I've moved into a new house.
152376	156757	And the cool thing is that we're going to tape out of the garage now, so it's going to be like this huge studio, but here's the problem.
157429	164496	We tried to call Comcast to get an appointment a week before we moved, just after we taped the last show, and they said they would not come out until August 7th.
164876	166458	So we were screwed with no internet at the house.
166558	169741	It has been hell trying to have internet at the house for this week.
169761	170762	There's been nothing.
170822	171923	Stolen Wi-Fi, that's it.
172263	174465	And we couldn't broadcast a show off of stolen Wi-Fi.
174525	176827	So we had to move to a temporary home this week.
176887	178469	So that's why we're at Studio Loki tonight.
179069	180070	And things are a little crazy.
181644	182184	But that's okay.
182204	183845	We didn't want to go two weeks of not having a show.
183865	189568	I mean, because we seriously considered it because of everything going on with Jamie and going on at the other studio.
189628	195271	But we just didn't want to have to go two weeks with no show because that can sometimes be suicide for listeners and everything.
195571	197112	We really appreciate those of you guys sticking with us.
197512	198432	Of course, we are in chat.
198452	199133	We have everything up.
199213	200833	We should hopefully still have Skype line tonight.
201173	203975	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to join us in the chat room.
204635	206215	And of course, lots of gaming news tonight.
206815	212236	Loki's got something really big he wants to talk about in Part B. It's going to be really cool, so we'll talk about that a little later.
212917	215857	Alright, let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week?
216437	218518	So we'll start off, How Was Your Gaming Week, Loki?
219218	220738	Extremely busy.
221398	223518	That's basically how I can describe it.
223998	229900	I've played so much crap over the last few days, or actually the last couple weeks, that it's just ridiculous.
229920	232420	Well, let's start off with the PSP stuff.
233238	238365	I went back and played through a little bit more of WTF and that game is weird.
238626	241510	The more games I unlock, the weirder the game gets.
242431	243432	It's awesome though.
244274	245335	I recommend checking it out.
245355	246617	It's probably dirt cheap by now.
247419	251862	Um, another game I played actually just came out in the UK called State Shift.
252362	254403	It's a kind of a futuristic racing game.
254843	260186	I guess a little bit like Wipeout, but it's, you know, with cars or these futuristic vehicles.
260907	262307	Um, didn't care for it too much.
262367	269271	The cars drive like, you know, giant bricks with rockets on them, and it was impossible to make corners and stuff.
269871	273393	So, not a game I'd pick up, but then again, I'm not in the UK, so it doesn't matter.
274114	274214	Um...
275151	283799	Final Fantasy, I finished it finally, and I'm so glad I'm finished with it because those new dungeons that they added on with the PlayStation 1 release, just crap.
284239	287222	It's just like, oh, we need some dungeons, quick, let's make some.
287843	290665	I mean, and they have no continuity whatsoever, just crap.
291246	293888	And I was so pissed off at the game, so that's done.
294246	297770	Final Fantasy 2 I played it for about 5 minutes, turned it off because I didn't want to play it anymore.
298091	300934	The battle system is just not good.
300994	301275	What?
301455	302476	I love Final Fantasy 2.
302736	304158	I played it on the Game Boy Advance a lot.
304198	304759	You don't like it?
304939	306121	I don't like it.
306561	311347	You know, for me though, I think Final Fantasy 11 takes a lot from Final Fantasy 2.
312588	320193	I love Final Fantasy 2.
320233	322174	I think it's more fun than Final Fantasy 1.
322514	323995	I can't wait to play the PSP port.
324235	325916	Wait, so you have Final Fantasy 2 on PSP?
326096	326157	Yes.
326177	326797	And you're not playing it?
327157	327317	Yeah.
327437	329078	I think you should let me have it for a little while.
330039	330539	Might be fun.
330559	331560	I have no internet at home.
331600	332220	Take pity on me.
332540	332821	Maybe.
333001	333241	Alright.
335763	356441	Beyond the PSP, on the 360 I played quite a few things, including some demos I tried the demo for Beautiful Katamari, which a lot of people don't know is actually out there It's not on live, but if you happen to subscribe to the official Xbox magazine There is a demo disc for Beautiful Katamari in the September issue
357042	357803	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
385894	387435	Actually, I'm pretty surprised.
388376	389477	I've been playing it quite a bit.
390377	396222	At first, you're like, well, maybe it should be slightly good because then the townsfolk will help you out with stuff.
396762	401926	Then eventually, they start pissing you off, and I think that they programmed that game that way on purpose.
402306	406670	So I just go through the towns and basically kill everybody, and I can do that over and over.
406710	410413	I've got my wenches, and it's awesome.
411473	413135	And then, let's see...
414233	418454	I also, on the PlayStation 3, I got my import copy of Wengen Midnight.
419134	420154	And that's pretty cool.
421075	424295	The game itself, though, graphically, looks like a PlayStation 2 game.
424636	426636	That's probably the only disappointing thing about it.
427156	430297	Otherwise, you know, I guess it's exactly like the arcade game.
430857	436298	Do you think they were originally building it for PlayStation 2 and just decided to... It came out for PlayStation 2, like, last year.
436338	442600	But it's not... I mean, the graphics, if you were to put it up against, like, you know, Need for Speed or...
443480	445821	I can't remember those are basically the main things
472933	473653	Alright, moving on.
474593	480255	MyGamingWeek, and I'm looking at chatroom at chat.orangelandredo.com JVmon says, Sky must be dying without World of Warcraft.
480615	484776	You know, I wasn't until I heard all the news from BlizzCon this week, which we'll get into in a little bit.
484816	486856	Nextfer's going to give us a report because he was there at BlizzCon.
487276	491417	But then when I heard all of that, I was like, I have to get my character to 70.
492438	495878	But before BlizzCon happened, I was doing okay with no World of Warcraft.
495898	496939	Because I was busy moving.
496999	498079	Like, you know, when you have all this...
498519	501741	Stuff you gotta get out of another place, and believe me, I have a lot of crap, okay?
501761	503202	I have a lot of crap.
503483	506204	So moving that kind of kept me busy and kept my mind off WoW.
506585	511148	But when I did finally get everything settled in and I had no internet, that didn't leave a whole lot to play.
511208	516311	So I went back to old PlayStation 2 games that I never really finished, and the first one that came to mind was Kingdom Hearts 2.
516511	521555	Because I played that game quite a ways in before the first time I played it, and then just kind of stopped.
521835	525718	So I'm just restarting that, and I pretty much caught up to where I was, and...
526198	541322	You know, Kingdom Hearts 2, yeah, I guess its biggest downfall is that the battle system is kind of a bit of button mashing, and it's nothing that intuitive, but I'll be damned if you don't just kind of immerse yourself in the world, and the way they tie things together is so great, and the voice acting is pretty darn good, except for Aerith, I hate her.
542242	546963	And everything else, the music and the graphics and the full motions, it's a great game.
547243	548504	One of my favorite PlayStation 2 games.
549784	550924	I don't remember the other game I played.
551025	551325	What's that?
551345	552585	Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3.
552805	553505	I played the demo for that.
553525	553746	Oh, the demo?
553766	554126	How was that?
554826	566670	It was very short, again, but it kind of reminds me a little bit of God of War, but it's a whole lot of button mashing, it seems like, because it's basically two buttons that you do certain moves with, and you can switch your weapon up a little bit.
566810	568591	But I don't know.
568891	574053	I'm probably going to pick it up just because there's not a whole lot coming out for the PlayStation 3, so it's worth my money.
577850	578952	Interesting comment.
579012	583638	DarkTetsuya says, Kingdom Hearts 3 should use something along the lines of Final Fantasy XII.
584059	588104	Final Fantasy XII did have a pretty awesome battle system, but I don't know if it would work in the Kingdom Hearts universe.
588585	594493	But a lot of people think that Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be different because I believe the creator has said, Kingdom Hearts 3 is not Kingdom Hearts 3.
595254	597395	It's something else in the Kingdom Hearts universe.
597616	598816	So, we'll see.
598856	600498	It's still a ways out before they announce anything.
601418	606281	RavensDolphin in chat says, Sky got so much stuff, moving a lot of gay porn books takes a lot of space.
607102	608603	You would know, RavensDolphin, you would.
609643	612165	Mikotov, how was your gaming week?
612185	613626	What kind of games did you play this week?
614527	616288	Well, I'll start with Sunday.
616308	617449	I was at Comic Con.
617469	620370	I was going to ask you to give us the Comic Con reports since you weren't here last week.
620390	620811	How was that?
621411	622132	Boring.
622312	623453	I don't like comics.
626616	630579	I went for Heroes and Battlestar, and I was happy with both of those.
630619	641188	But I got to play Silent Hill Origins, and I haven't played that since it was the behind-the-shoulder camera, and it's actually looking really good, and it was really fun.
641929	647094	It wasn't really scary because it's in a bright room with a lot of people, and you're playing it on a PSP.
647894	649115	But whatever, it was still cool.
650315	659779	Other than that, I played World of Warcraft, and I played Loki's demo of Beautiful Katamari, and that's really it.
660499	661840	Did you enjoy Beautiful Katamari?
661960	663721	Yes, it was a really fun three minutes.
664821	666082	Best three minutes you ever spent?
666342	668363	No, but it was a fun three minutes.
668683	670724	What would be the best three minutes you ever spent, game-wise?
670744	671524	Next question.
671644	672464	Oh my, alright.
672785	673725	Game-wise, game-wise.
674306	675807	Next question.
675867	677147	Fine, jerk.
677227	679248	All right, so that's it for your gaming week?
680109	680589	I think so.
680849	681909	I didn't really do much.
682310	683650	I never do much with WoW.
683710	687912	We've all been pretty boring between moving and all this other stuff.
687932	688893	Having my office closed.
688913	689173	That's right.
689193	690533	You've been moving out of your office.
690793	691194	Yeah.
691214	691874	Is everything okay?
691914	692534	You doing all right?
692734	693134	Yeah.
693154	694335	Was there any last hurrah?
694435	696676	Did everybody go out for drinks one last time or anything?
696916	697757	No, actually.
697857	699097	Nobody went out for drinks.
699117	699557	That's kind of sad.
699577	700178	It was weird.
700458	700698	All right.
701178	703079	We normally drink for no reason.
703219	704860	This was a reason and nobody drank.
705001	712045	I hope I'm okay to say this on the show, though, but as I understand, there's little bits and pieces that you collected for listeners in the future.
712065	714627	Yeah, and I'll give those to you to give away.
714767	719730	So more information at a later date on You Can Own a Piece of What Once Was Konami.
720330	721811	Aw, that's so sad.
722512	722972	How sad.
723072	724673	Why are we laughing?
724713	725214	I'm sorry.
725434	726234	Look how adorable.
726294	728896	It really is sad because I know we had a lot of fun.
729076	729596	Thanks for watching!
748203	749024	Thanks for watching!
764386	764706	Wow.
764927	765467	Next.
767189	768590	Oh my gosh, this is the worst radio.
768890	770912	Yes, DarkTitsui has summed it up in chat.
770952	771693	Worst radio ever.
772073	773414	Whatever, you're the worst radio ever.
773434	776377	This will be the last show from Studio Loki because this is what happens to the show.
777077	779499	All right, anyhow, housekeeping real quick.
780080	785264	We weren't here last week, so we weren't able to tell you guys that we got nominated in the podcast awards at podcastawards.com.
785284	787366	So thank you guys very much for helping us to get the nominations.
787947	789048	And the voting is now open.
789528	794314	So if you head on over to www.podcastwards.com, you can vote for Orange Launch Radio.
794334	796096	We're nominated for Best Gaming Podcast.
796797	799760	And it's really cool because lots of independent podcasts are nominated.
799800	803404	They upped it from 5 to 10 this year, and there's lots of independent podcasts nominated.
803444	805567	A lot of good shows, including our good buddies at All Games.
806208	806949	And they are...
808027	809208	Thank you for watching!
829817	832038	Hit those confirmation emails.
832058	833398	Just do it legitimately.
833478	833938	Don't cheat.
834238	835719	It is legitimate.
835759	837479	I was just going to say, it gives us a bad name.
837539	838339	It is legitimate.
838359	839340	I'm saying for the people out there.
839400	839720	I know.
840140	840980	Be legit and ethical.
841040	843341	I'm not saying use a program to do it or anything.
843361	843781	Please don't.
843801	849802	I'm just saying, you know, if you have email addresses, you can vote four times.
850963	851843	Seriously, people that...
853172	858296	People that are listening to gaming podcasts are probably so fucking sick about hearing about podcast awards.
859237	861378	Well, it was just nice to be nominated again.
861418	862299	Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
862319	863760	It's always lovely to be nominated.
863780	867683	But we want to win again, so... You know what's better than being nominated again?
868243	868924	Winning again.
869084	870004	That's what's even better.
870605	871746	No, I'm just teasing, really.
871846	873867	No, it really is great that we got nominated.
874087	876609	And the fact that there's a lot of shows that haven't been in there before.
877430	878310	It's all independent.
878350	879772	I hoard us out to my work again.
879792	880232	Those people...
880692	888260	Those people that do the shows that got nominated, you know, they don't get a lot of, I don't think any of them, I don't think any of them get paid to do their business.
888520	889861	ScrewAttack was on there.
890322	890622	Do they?
890822	891263	I don't know.
891723	892284	I don't even know.
892304	895207	Well, they're affiliated with, you know, GameTrailers.com.
895227	895507	Okay.
896661	897381	We need this!
897401	897841	We need this!
919046	919927	HURRAY FOR NOMINATIONS
939057	942599	Wrath of the Lich King Wrath of the Don King
966571	970894	Even though there's going to be no new races, there is going to be a new class, Death Knight.
971714	972475	So that's kind of fun.
972515	974396	And apparently every race can be a Death Knight.
974636	975897	So there's going to be lots of Death Knights.
976217	979459	And I've already reserved the name Death Cake so you can't have it for Death Knight.
979519	989085	Well, I was just going to say, you know, if you were like, say, Leroy Jenkins and he was a knight, he would be a Death Knight because he's dead in the game because he got killed.
989165	989646	How funny.
990486	999312	Anyways, what's not funny though is the fact that you may need Burning Crusade in order to play some aspects of Wrath of the Lich King.
999372	1009879	Which is not surprising because I think with Burning Crusade it did raise the level cap and obviously you're not going to be able to go to 80 if you don't have Burning Crusade.
1010559	1016743	But they haven't really said exactly what will not be available if you don't have Burning Crusade.
1017318	1025524	Well also, it should be pointed out, there's some new battlegrounds and it's going to have siege warfare and buildings that you can destroy with your siege weapons, so that's going to be pretty awesome.
1025984	1029647	And then supposedly you're going to be able to customize your characters even further than what you can do now.
1029667	1031028	Yes, new hair, I can't wait.
1031088	1032769	That's good because it is kind of limited right now.
1032790	1035311	You know what the best thing so far about the expansion is?
1035371	1035612	What?
1035732	1037553	It's blue, like crazy.
1037893	1038894	I cannot wait.
1038934	1040996	Because it's ice and cold and all that stuff.
1041016	1042797	Yes, it's snowy and I'm so excited.
1042857	1046780	I could talk for hours about it, but I guess that's Christopher's job because he went there.
1046980	1048061	Well, let's talk to Christopher.
1048101	1049862	How was BlizzCon, Christopher?
1050043	1050923	First of all, how did you go?
1050983	1052084	It was a birthday thing, right?
1052264	1054226	Yeah, my sister got it for me for my birthday.
1054326	1054966	Oh, that was sweet.
1055307	1056328	And didn't think to invite us.
1056408	1056948	That's all right.
1056968	1057428	I know.
1057508	1058509	That's all right.
1058549	1059730	But it's $100 per ticket.
1059970	1060711	We would have bought it.
1060751	1061432	We would have bought it.
1061472	1062492	No, we were moving.
1062693	1063053	It's all good.
1063273	1066055	Well, tell us about what was it like when he got there?
1066135	1067456	What kind of stuff did they have going on?
1068217	1074562	Well, we got there pretty early in the morning on Friday morning because we wanted to get our badges.
1075023	1075163	And
1075723	1076684	Thank you for watching!
1092168	1093289	Waited for the doors to open.
1093349	1094109	They opened the doors.
1094169	1097991	When you walked in, it was really dark.
1098692	1103595	You could see the main hall, which is where they announced the expansion.
1104355	1105916	And it was in bright blue.
1106777	1107397	Yay, blue.
1107817	1112640	They had two big screens and a lot of chairs.
1112800	1119364	I mean, there was just, you know, and even everybody filled up the chairs and people were standing on the sidelines.
1119404	1121365	People were blocking everybody's view and
1121923	1123124	The opening ceremony was pretty good.
1123164	1129589	They talked about a lot of stuff, StarCraft II, World of Warcraft, and they showed us the trailer to the expansion, and that was pretty cool.
1129689	1130730	I think everybody knew StarCraft
1148184	1157466	The expansion was going to be called Wrath of the Lich King because in our maps it said there was a specific area that said World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King area.
1157606	1161346	So everybody was clued in as to what was coming.
1161366	1163847	Well, plus it had been leaked to the internet like two days before.
1163907	1169008	While you all were driving down, the whole internet knew thanks to some European thing.
1169268	1172528	I guess the official Blizzard site in Europe or something leaked it.
1172548	1174669	Yeah, they had the whole FAQ that's up now.
1175589	1177271	Yeah, still some people were skeptical.
1177311	1181214	They thought it was going to be Maelstrom, but I don't know.
1182135	1184477	The Wrath of the Lich King, we got to play it three times.
1186038	1187799	I personally, I really liked it.
1188260	1189201	What was the demo like?
1189221	1189801	What did you do in it?
1190302	1194445	Well, you start out in the Undercity area and you fly on a...
1197168	1197808	Whatever that is.
1199929	1201290	I think your computer just farted.
1203610	1211713	Okay, for those people not in the studio, that's the pipes from someone next door they're using and there's air in the pipes.
1212074	1213094	That was a cool noise.
1213134	1214114	That was a Silent Hill noise.
1214134	1214774	That was freaky.
1214815	1216015	I wish the folks at home could hear that.
1216255	1217116	Alright, so expansion.
1217417	1219619	Yeah, we got to play the expansion.
1219679	1224905	We start out in Undercity, ride a Zeppelin to the new Northrend area.
1224945	1228269	You don't really know where it is in Northrend, but just that it's in Northrend.
1229070	1232875	And it's the Howling Fjord or whatever, is that right?
1232895	1233756	Yes, that's correct.
1234276	1235237	I just couldn't remember.
1235377	1239399	There were so many names that you discovered in the expansion we didn't know where we were.
1240819	1244521	And pretty much you go to this grassy type area first.
1244982	1247763	There's a town and you're next to the ocean.
1248223	1250344	And you can go up.
1251045	1253146	You ride this lift up to the top.
1253186	1257388	And there's actually in the trailer for Wrath of the Lich King you see the top of the lift.
1257808	1261930	So you're kind of excited because you're playing a part that's in the trailer.
1262230	1264471	Then you can go to the right.
1265752	1271674	There was a lot of snowy area you can go into, and then there was a lot of burning woodsy areas.
1271814	1272835	Okay, too much detail.
1272875	1274935	Did they let you play Death Knight?
1275156	1282039	No, they don't let you play Death Knight, but they did play that trailer over and over and over and over again.
1282079	1285340	Did you get to do anything in the demo that you can't really already do in WoW right now?
1286516	1288359	Yeah, that's nothing really new.
1288579	1292486	You can do quests, but they weren't really new.
1292526	1295030	You could tell that they were holding off on that stuff.
1295572	1298094	It was just really kind of a way to explore the area.
1298134	1299815	There was a dungeon you can go to.
1299916	1301397	And so lots of nerds could go.
1301417	1305020	I played it first before any of you did in my murloc suit.
1305340	1307662	Really, I would say it was a good start.
1308202	1309723	Good effort.
1309783	1310464	Yeah, good effort.
1311164	1323034	And it wasn't like you couldn't go to the other areas that were already there because one of our players is a mage who can portal you and he portaled us to another city and it was kind of cool because we were the only three people there.
1323574	1324475	So yeah, it was kind of cool.
1325156	1325436	Cool.
1325476	1326918	How about StarCraft 2?
1327138	1327879	Did you get a chance to play that?
1328099	1328940	Yeah.
1329020	1335586	StarCraft 2, I've never played StarCraft before, let alone any game like StarCraft, so I was new to the whole genre.
1336928	1339530	But I can say that I really liked it.
1339590	1341092	I really enjoyed it.
1341893	1344595	Very good graphics, lots of detail.
1346537	1348480	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1363257	1363797	Thanks for watching!
1378232	1379293	There were families there.
1379413	1385076	There were people that were fat and nasty there.
1385116	1387637	There were nerds, just like skinny, scrawny nerds.
1387677	1389098	There were hot people.
1389678	1392400	I mean, people dressed in Blood Elf costumes.
1392920	1397042	Now, you were saying before that Leroy Jenkins, the guy that does Leroy Jenkins, he was there.
1397062	1398043	He was there.
1398143	1401765	You were like wetting your pants over that guy.
1402305	1406067	He actually... Okay, Jay Moore, who is kind of the DJ...
1406967	1408629	of the whole event.
1408929	1410751	He did like a last comic standing, right?
1410951	1411331	Yeah.
1411511	1413813	Before he got fired.
1414054	1416556	He actually did a really good job.
1417096	1423862	There were some hecklers that kind of derailed the closing ceremony for a little bit, but he pulled it together.
1424062	1425163	Everybody was laughing.
1425483	1427525	He made even the most skeptical people.
1427585	1429247	There was one girl behind me that was
1429847	1432188	DJ Dark Knight in chat wants to know, were there Korean players there?
1432208	1433688	But he's no Jamie Kennedy, that's for sure.
1457992	1471275	Actually, there were Korean players there, mostly for StarCraft, but there were people that won the costume contests in the Korean Invitational that they did a few months ago, or a month ago or whatever.
1472195	1482077	They actually participated in the costume contest this year, and it was a warlock, and they were done very well, but it just so happens there was another warlock that topped them, and she was just incredible.
1482197	1485218	She was like, oh my god, she looked incredible.
1485779	1493143	But yeah, the Leroy Jenkins guy was there, and he did his Leroy Jenkins, and he was just too hot for words.
1493203	1493884	Wow, nerdy.
1494464	1495365	How was Video Games Live?
1496272	1496652	Awesome.
1497073	1501815	They did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft, as you can imagine.
1501875	1503376	But they also... Yeah, that's the one in one.
1503476	1503756	I'm sorry.
1504437	1514022	Anyways, they did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft, but they also did the new music from StarCraft II, which was sucky because it sounded exactly like Star Wars.
1515223	1519365	But we got to hear that, and we got to hear lots of music from Diablo.
1520266	1524408	And there was also a band that played last night called...
1525008	1526589	They were like this horde band.
1526709	1528870	It was totally manufactured by the makers of WoW.
1528890	1530971	You could tell because the creator of WoW was in the band.
1531371	1533952	But nevertheless, they were funny.
1533972	1534552	What were they called?
1534612	1534952	Level 70?
1535172	1537293	Level 70 Elite Torrin Chieftain.
1537933	1539894	Did they actually dress up like Torrin?
1539914	1540695	No, they actually didn't.
1540715	1541795	Like they were Gwar or something?
1542035	1542515	They didn't.
1542555	1542855	That sucks.
1542875	1546657	But they did, when you went and waited in the line to play Wrath of the Lich King...
1547877	1552179	There was a big screen next to them, and they kept playing the video that was game-made.
1552280	1558943	They made it in-game video for that, and it was just incredibly ridiculous, but it was funny, I guess.
1560023	1567607	But they have a song called Rogues Do It From Behind, which was just funny, because I'm a rogue, and I do it from behind.
1569613	1570994	I think I just threw up in my mouth.
1571074	1571394	Thank you.
1571414	1572414	I was going for that.
1572934	1576735	If only there was a camera to capture everybody's expressions just then.
1577516	1580476	So, yeah, the whole show was pretty good.
1580516	1581897	I had such a fun time.
1582597	1582997	Good deal.
1583037	1585378	Anything else you want to share that you think our listeners ought to know about?
1585658	1587158	What was the funniest thing that happened all show?
1587358	1588279	The funniest thing?
1588359	1588559	Yeah.
1589859	1590339	Oh, God.
1590439	1592980	All the nerds asking stupid questions at the panels.
1594066	1598649	They would say stuff like, okay, we're not going to answer these questions, and what do the nerds fucking do?
1598690	1600030	They ask those fucking questions.
1600050	1600671	Give us an example.
1600691	1601912	The movie panel, you said was one, right?
1601952	1602532	Movie panel, okay.
1602632	1603493	That was a big thing.
1604033	1605354	They're actually doing a movie.
1605414	1614901	The same people who did Batman Begins, Superman Returns, Legendary 300, or whatever.
1615682	1620065	They are doing the movie, and they are really standing by this film.
1621005	1621526	There was...
1622307	1634983	There were questions that they wouldn't answer though, and that was, those were, we won't answer questions on which races, which characters will be in the movies, but you can expect to maybe see these, and they listed these characters, right?
1635363	1636004	Everybody cheered.
1636957	1640518	Dark Knight wants to know, he would have asked, and will we be hearing Back Me Wool?
1661622	1663103	In the movie, anywhere.
1663363	1663823	We should.
1664624	1666385	Dip in the archives if you don't get that joke.
1666525	1669966	In fact, they said that there's going to be a lot of humor carried over from the game.
1670066	1675349	So they're looking forward to carrying some of the humor, but still keep it on a serious level.
1675389	1678531	You didn't tell them about what the worst part of the movie is so far.
1678551	1680772	Oh, well, they're going to tell it from the Alliance perspective.
1680812	1681112	Boo!
1681192	1682413	Alliance sucks!
1682473	1688596	Yeah, and the funny thing about it is that most people there, we got the feeling that most people there were in the horde.
1689216	1694538	Which is funny, because most people that play the game are Alliance, but they're all kids that can't afford to go to BlizzCon.
1695838	1699119	SonOfDad is in chat, wants to know, who's directing the film, did they say?
1699459	1701740	They don't have a director, there was somebody that asked that.
1702140	1707642	They want to get the script all together first, before they go search for a director.
1708202	1710323	And he said, oh, there was a funny story.
1710763	1734490	The guy that is with Legendary said that the guy who played Superman last year, he said they won't go into casting details, but they did say that last year he overheard the Legendary people on the phone with the WoW people, and he said, oh my god, can you get me a backstage tour of where they do WoW and all this stuff, and they did, and he went.
1734790	1738531	I seem to remember hearing something about that that guy was a WoW player, the guy who was Superman.
1738551	1738631	Yeah.
1739198	1740439	Thank you for watching!
1751587	1752187	Tell-A-Dressel
1775243	1775623	That's what it is.
1775643	1776364	Something like that, yeah.
1801280	1802060	So it's just kind of interesting.
1802080	1803241	Because he's Asian.
1804101	1804481	Shut up.
1805322	1805662	Let's see.
1805722	1807823	Looking at chat, another comment here.
1807883	1810744	DarkDeadCity wants to know, will the WoW movie be 60 hours long?
1811845	1812745	That would be awesome.
1812885	1815767	They said it's going to be between two and two and a half hours long.
1815907	1822730	Well, yes, it will be 60 hours long, but then you can buy an expansion for just $39.95 that will expand it to 70 hours long.
1822990	1823570	Yeah.
1823650	1827592	It was kind of funny because one of the people on the panel made a comment saying,
1828171	1829212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1850132	1854557	RossDLUT in chat is like pulling up a pillow and blanket because he just doesn't care about WoW.
1855457	1857680	We don't care about whoever that was that you just said.
1857820	1859081	I don't care about WoW either.
1859361	1859641	All right.
1859942	1861043	Are you doing okay over there, Loki?
1861303	1862064	I'm doing fine.
1862084	1862264	All right.
1862284	1863265	Well, let's get on to some other news.
1863285	1865707	Thank you guys very much for your respective con reports.
1865767	1867049	Actually, Mikotov, yours was kind of bad.
1867189	1868170	I didn't really care about your report.
1868210	1869471	I didn't even really talk about it.
1869491	1870472	Yeah, you didn't really do anything.
1870492	1870572	Well,
1870572	1873213	Well, I could talk about it more, but I don't want to, because you're a jerk.
1873293	1880237	Tell us really, you know, I don't know, maybe if they don't like World of Warcraft, they like Battlestar, but please tell me about how you met the guy that played Tyrell and what you did.
1880477	1883718	Okay, spoilers maybe, just so everybody knows.
1884799	1891322	So the guy that plays Tyrell, Aaron Douglas, was at Comic-Con, and I went to go get his autograph.
1891782	1895024	And I went up to him, and I was like, can you write something mean about Callie, like...
1895484	1917744	Callie sucks and Callie is his wife on the show and I absolutely hate her and he laughed at me and then he started signing my thing I gave him to sign and he put Shane or to Shane Aaron Douglas chief I can't wait for Callie to die in season 4 episode 5 dot dot dot that was my favorite thing ever and I have something to look forward to
1918044	1923692	I'd just like to point out that Shane called me long distance right after this happened just to tell me about this experience.
1923712	1924533	Because it's important.
1924753	1926356	It was like the coolest thing ever.
1928115	1928635	Tech5 Tech5
1956109	1962711	It's going to be simultaneously launched on the PC, the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and believe it or not, the Mac.
1962971	1974395	Yeah, originally when they were showing off the Tech 5 demo, or Tech 5, I guess it was a demonstration of it, they were actually showing off bits of Rage, and it's kind of got a little bit of driving in there.
1974435	1979637	There's a bit of first-person shooter stuff in there as well, so it's kind of like Motorstorm meets Quake.
1980817	1984861	In fact, here's a quote from Todd Hallenscheid, the CEO of ID Software.
1985301	1986762	It's more than just a first-person shooter.
1986822	1989765	We will show vehicles and racetracks, driving and racing elements.
1990165	1993068	It is an action-oriented game, but with a lot of adventure elements.
1993468	1997151	It will be story-driven, but you can also choose your own route to go through things.
1997812	1997952	Hmm.
1999093	2004798	As long as it's better than Quake 4, because Quake 4 held my interest for about three seconds and I was like, eh, not interested.
2005098	2008361	Yeah, well hopefully this will hold your interest for a little bit longer than that.
2008681	2011264	Quake Arena is headed to Xbox Live Arcade.
2011624	2012365	Now this is something we...
2013231	2013951	I was thinking, is this like the...
2040161	2043164	Old school version of Quake, but just adapted for Xbox Live.
2043244	2044245	It might be, I don't know.
2044625	2047488	Will it have the original Nine Inch Nails soundtrack and all that?
2047969	2048710	I don't think so.
2048970	2049731	I'll be sad.
2051573	2053774	I have fond memories of Quake.
2053834	2057516	This was back in the day when broadband you could only find in colleges.
2058636	2060397	Broadband was not really sold for commercial use.
2061117	2068720	My friends went to college in the Bay Area and I used to call in, dial up to their broadband connection and we would play Quake.
2068780	2071161	About three of them in the dorms and then me on dial up.
2071582	2072742	We'd stay up all night long playing Quake.
2072762	2073302	It was awesome.
2074123	2076044	You couldn't do that with Duke Nukem Forever for some reason.
2076204	2077404	I don't know.
2077664	2078665	Because it never came out.
2079845	2082366	Perhaps this is another game people will stay up all night playing, though.
2082406	2082766	I don't know.
2082806	2084626	It's a game called Quake Zero.
2084646	2090647	I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's probably Quake 3 Arena coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2091427	2092228	Actually, it's different.
2092268	2094328	Quake Zero is going to cost zero.
2094728	2095688	That's why it's called Quake Zero.
2095728	2096368	It's free.
2096568	2102830	I understand that, but the port of Quake 3 Arena... Oh, so the Quake Arena game... That would be awesome.
2102870	2104150	Quake 3 is my favorite.
2104690	2105070	Well, there you go.
2105110	2105951	Oh, that would be great.
2106291	2110473	Well, anyway, Quake Zero is going to be a web-based version of Quake 3 multiplayer.
2110513	2113615	So you can just fire up your web browser and play.
2113675	2116236	Has the source code been out for Quake 3?
2116296	2116816	I can't remember.
2116836	2119538	Well, it doesn't matter because it's being developed in-house anyway, so they have it.
2120318	2124940	But they're going to be putting it out there, and I guess it's going to be ad-supported.
2124980	2126381	It's going to have some in-game advertising.
2126401	2127241	That's how it's really going to be $0.
2128622	2129843	but free is good.
2130863	2135246	I would love to see Quake and I'm playing it and then there's a McDonald's ad or something.
2135786	2137607	That would make it totally realistic.
2139829	2141970	DarkTetsuya says LOL Quake Zero.
2142030	2143571	Zero calories, zero sugar.
2144271	2146933	I guess, you know, from all that sitting.
2147613	2148814	More caffeine, exactly.
2149834	2155618	NintendoManiac64 said I wonder if Quake Zero will be anything like Phosphor when it runs on Shockwave.
2156518	2159460	RossDLUT says, yeah, ID released the source code ages ago.
2159500	2161160	I thought I remember reading something about that.
2161400	2170545	Now, if only Quake Zero were compatible with the Wii web browser, which I honestly doubt it would be, but we can hope.
2171825	2178468	One thing that will be compatible, though, they announced Unreal Tournament 3, which is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 later this year.
2179609	2181990	It's going to be supporting keyboard and mouse.
2182623	2184184	So that's kind of cool.
2185345	2192069	I know a lot of people really love keyboard and mouse, especially playing PC first-person shooters.
2192550	2197033	So now you can actually do that on the console and kind of have a fair shake at people playing on PC.
2197973	2199554	Or as people playing on PC.
2200996	2203558	That's kind of cool because that will put that whole debate to rest finally.
2203598	2204439	People can take it out.
2204479	2207322	What is better, the controller or the keyboard and mouse?
2207382	2208483	People can finally duke it out.
2208503	2214308	The other thing, I mean, Unreal Tournament 3 for the PS3 is actually kind of shaping up more like a PC game.
2214328	2220034	I mean, obviously it is a PC game as well, but with the fact that you can download mods for it.
2220214	2221335	That is pretty awesome.
2221375	2223517	I've got to hand it to PlayStation 3 for that.
2223637	2224638	It's going to be sweet.
2226215	2226796	We will see.
2228900	2233387	RavensDolphin in chat says, Bluetooth mouse and keyboard for the win.
2233467	2239738	Tigerclaw said, Unreal Tournament 3 players with keyboard and mouse will pwn the UT3 players with the 6-axis.
2241957	2243778	Well, it's not like the keyboard and mouse are going to vibrate either.
2244338	2245438	So, you got that.
2246639	2250620	Also, some other news coming out of QuakeCon.
2250700	2253521	Is this coming out of QuakeCon or is this just about the same time?
2253741	2254802	It's about the same time.
2255202	2256262	It might be out of QuakeCon.
2256342	2257123	Well, we'll see here.
2257643	2261004	Actually, this story is coming from Ain't It Cool News, which is kind of interesting.
2261624	2265466	Roger Avery is working on an adaptation of
2265882	2268665	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2284148	2284468	I think so.
2284488	2284909	I think so.
2285889	2286189	Didn't he?
2286530	2288031	I don't know, but I know he's not doing it again.
2288071	2289011	I know he was tied to it.
2289051	2290352	Oh yeah, we talked about that a couple weeks ago.
2290612	2292653	Well, I'm talking about it now, so continue your story.
2293574	2303160	We'll see World War... According to Ain't It Cool News, they expect we'll see World War II crazy tongue-in-cheek horror sci-fi action.
2303200	2307803	I wonder if you'll get like Hitler in the big mech like you fought in the game.
2307823	2309484	That would be kind of strange.
2309504	2311325	It sounds perfect for Uwe Boll, though.
2312397	2315300	Oh, I forgot to mention that earlier.
2316401	2318062	I interviewed Uwe Boll this week.
2318242	2318903	What the hell?
2318983	2320064	How did you not mention this?
2320124	2324327	People turned the show off ten minutes ago with all the WoW talk.
2324507	2325188	I forgot.
2325228	2326189	You met Uwe Boll?
2326509	2327210	I didn't meet him.
2327310	2328631	I interviewed him over the phone, though.
2328671	2329491	Oh, okay.
2329752	2330492	But not for this show.
2330612	2331413	No, not for this show.
2331493	2332954	I interviewed him for my work.
2333074	2333575	All right.
2333615	2334195	Well, what happened?
2334896	2335757	Okay, well, here's the thing.
2336097	2340941	I had to watch his movie BloodRayne 2 Deliverance, and it's horrible.
2341767	2344970	Vampire Western Vampire Western Vampire Western
2359855	2365956	Now, obviously the interview was tame because it was for a magazine, so we had to be positive about the whole thing.
2365996	2367897	But we did ask him about the boxing stuff.
2367937	2368697	That was kind of funny.
2370297	2375639	I actually have the whole interview transcribed on the Orange Lounge live journal community.
2375679	2378879	So if you want to check it out there, you can see everything we talked about.
2378899	2380340	We also talked about there's a new...
2382586	2386055	movie he's doing called Tunnel Rats that's being made into a game at the same time.
2386195	2387719	So that's kind of an interesting thing.
2388521	2390646	And then, of course, Postal's coming out this year, so...
2391547	2395628	They had a lot of advertisement at Comic Con for Postal.
2395668	2396228	It was weird.
2421792	2446430	But, um, I don't know But, okay, interesting is a very, like, broad word Because, like, you could know a guy that, like, picks his nose and eats it And you could go, that's really interesting I kind of felt bad for him a little bit Because he's not trying to make awesome movies He's just trying to make genre flicks And he just happens to use video games to kind of supplement that To get more of an audience I don't know
2446963	2448944	He's kind of a low, underachiever, I guess.
2449525	2453407	Who wakes, who gets out of bed in the morning and goes, I want to make a vampire western?
2455528	2456328	Film students?
2456849	2457769	I guess so.
2458830	2462592	I think we should make Orange Lounge Radio the movie, and it should be a vampire western.
2463272	2467795	Okay, the movie itself, I knew it was bad, like, within the first two minutes.
2467915	2470717	I watched the whole movie and fast-forwarded, because I couldn't stand it.
2471357	2476100	Luckily, though, I got to hear most of the dialogue, because it was really slow.
2477116	2478876	The only bad thing about it, there was no nudity.
2479357	2480137	That kind of sucked.
2480497	2487279	But, Zach Ward, the guy that plays the main character in the Postal movie, he played Billy the Kid, the vampire.
2487979	2489599	And I kind of liked him in that.
2489879	2492000	I thought he was a good vampire.
2492220	2498602	Because, and here's why he was a good vampire, he would hurt innocent people without a thought.
2498682	2506044	You know, like, for example, the very end of the movie, she's going to rescue these kids because he's going to bite them all and turn them and, you know...
2506969	2508930	I don't know, make himself more immortal or something.
2509411	2515815	And she walks in and this trap springs and basically all the kids get hung.
2516575	2517756	Awesome!
2517896	2522359	And so she's pushing this counterweight back so that the kids don't die.
2522619	2524040	But unfortunately one of the little kids dies.
2524600	2526602	And so there's stuff like that throughout the whole movie.
2527182	2529704	And they're not afraid to hurt innocent little children in the movie.
2530164	2531064	I can respect that.
2531265	2531405	So...
2532305	2532705	I don't know.
2532906	2534246	Wow.
2534887	2536608	Kill children, earn points for Loki.
2536948	2546874	Actually, I gotta say real quick is that Robert M has the, in our chat room at chatonorangeloungeradio.com, has the first piece of casting news for Orange Lounge Radio, the new vampire western movie.
2547574	2549396	Loki has been cast to play Tingle.
2549956	2550536	Amazing.
2551617	2553218	There is no Tingle in this movie.
2554639	2556100	But where will we get our rupees?
2558301	2561503	Anyways, moving on to something completely opposite of that.
2562634	2571723	Lego Indiana Jones was announced at Comic Con because there aren't enough Lego franchises yet and they're going to milk that for every penny that they can.
2571763	2573005	But Lego games aren't that bad.
2573545	2574807	I can think of worse games.
2574927	2576168	I can think of far worse games.
2576188	2576749	They aren't that bad.
2576849	2580733	So following Lego Batman this year, you're going to be seeing Lego Indiana Jones next year.
2580753	2582775	And I want Lego Batman, by the way.
2584276	2584997	That'll be pretty cool.
2586707	2591630	Well, it's a pity that Jamie isn't here because she would probably be running circles around this story.
2591650	2592811	I'm very happy about this one.
2593591	2598514	Apparently, there is a Doctor Who video game that could be on its way for Christmas.
2599415	2605038	Top Trumps has revealed they plan for a Doctor Who video game to be released in time for Christmas 2007.
2605098	2609921	It's thought to be available on the PC, PlayStation 2, DS, and mobile games.
2610421	2614384	Apparently, an advertisement for the game appears in the new Doctor Who Top Trumps card pack.
2614824	2615625	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2637066	2638887	This is good news and bad news.
2638967	2641289	The good news is it's a Doctor Who video game.
2641669	2649873	The bad news is it's a Doctor Who video game because video games that are based off of TV shows and stuff usually don't go too well.
2650394	2656517	That's true, but remember they announced that Battlestar game for Xbox Live Arcade a while back?
2657258	2658798	It came out last week, I think.
2658919	2659739	Did it actually come out?
2659819	2661220	Oh, Battlestar.
2661240	2662401	I'm sorry, I'm thinking Wing Commander.
2662661	2663021	Oh, no.
2663321	2666583	Battlestar, I know it's on PartnerNet and my friends that work at
2667123	2695138	EA have been playing it and they actually said it's a pretty fun game even though like they're hardcore fans and it really is like a typical space shooter with Battlestar just plastered on it nothing really Battlestar related beyond that so you get occasional gems and I hope to goodness that the Heroes game that Ubisoft is doing is going to be good so I mean there's no need to really worry about games that come from TV shows I think
2697354	2699656	I guess that's a little bit more encouraging there.
2700656	2705680	Well, there is another interesting rumor that's come out recently.
2706180	2708482	And this is one that has me extremely excited.
2708762	2714506	Apparently, EGM has run their rumor mill story from Quarterman.
2714586	2715646	He does this every month.
2716427	2721550	And the rumor is that apparently they were, I believe, level 5.
2723672	2725733	They developed some RPGs and stuff.
2727006	2728586	Oh, actually, no, they weren't the ones that developed this.
2728626	2729026	My mistake.
2729387	2731287	Anyways, Bionic Commando.
2732027	2734608	It was originally going to be made into a PlayStation Network game.
2734708	2740449	However, they decided that they're just going to make it into a full-fledged game instead.
2741329	2745710	So, possibly a Bionic Commando game soon.
2747290	2752391	That would be all kinds of rad, because that's like an old series that a lot of people would like to see get brought back.
2752411	2754652	I'd be very happy about that.
2754692	2755552	As long as they don't, like...
2757100	2759002	turn it into a completely different game.
2759983	2760543	You know what I mean?
2761144	2763746	Like, try to keep some of the elements that made the first one fun.
2763786	2766148	Like, I would not want to see Bionic Commando go 3D.
2766549	2767810	That would not be fun for me.
2768690	2769311	But, I don't know.
2772874	2780681	It would probably, if they did it, like, if it was as good as the Rygar game, you know, when they updated that, I mean, that wasn't too bad, I think.
2781722	2781942	But...
2783200	2787727	Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom, chat.orangelandre.com says, Dear Capcom, Wii version.
2787787	2788228	K, thanks.
2789270	2790031	That could be interesting.
2791877	2792437	I don't know, we'll see.
2814251	2819214	NASCAR 06, FIFA World Cup 06, all those are shutting down.
2819414	2823796	And I guess the thought is that most of you will have upgraded to 08 by that point, if not at least 07.
2824577	2826938	But I haven't upgraded from Madden 06.
2827538	2828439	Why do you own Madden 06?
2828959	2831360	Don't you mean you haven't upgraded from Madden 99?
2831400	2833261	That is so not your kind of game, I thought.
2833521	2833802	It's not.
2833822	2834722	Is it achievement points?
2835502	2835783	No.
2835803	2836363	You're a whore.
2836603	2837884	You're a whore for achievement points.
2838764	2840266	Some other games that are getting shut down, though.
2840286	2840806	I got it for free.
2841046	2845410	Surprisingly, November 1st of 07, Burnout Revenge on Xbox and PlayStation 2.
2846431	2853678	So they're shutting off one of the Burnout titles, and the Need for Speed Underground and Most Wanted also getting the plug pulled on them, November 1st of 07.
2853718	2864108	Well, Underground's damn old, and Revenge, technically, on... Well, the Xbox is the latest one, but PlayStation, I mean, they had Dominator, so...
2865518	2865798	Oh well.
2866259	2874466	Well, if you're one of the five people that plays these games online still, then you're probably pretty angsty, so we dedicate the FUs of the Week just for you.
2874966	2882152	Now, usually we would have music here, but since we're in our temper, thank you.
2882192	2884094	Hey, that's the music.
2884134	2885194	We can find music.
2885355	2886836	It's too late now, we're live, remember?
2887356	2891680	Alright, so there we go, there's your music, and it's the FUs of the Week time, so Loki, start us off tonight.
2892856	2917991	my FU of the week goes to Genki for just porting the Playstation 2 version of Wengen Midnight to the Playstation 3 I mean, come on, spend a little bit more time hell, that fucking lame-ass game Import Tuner Challenge that came out on the Xbox 360 looked better than this that's sad and maybe some better music in it too because that's kind of sad too
2920199	2921159	Yeah, music like that!
2922680	2926941	My next FU goes to Shane for not shutting his cell phone off during the recording of the show.
2926961	2928182	I don't know what you're talking about.
2928222	2938725	My other FU goes to Comcast for making me suffer without internet until Tuesday, and also to whichever mystery neighbor I'm stealing Wi-Fi from for not being strong enough.
2939106	2947829	Although, I will give it this, like yesterday, the strength of the Wi-Fi was perfect, and I was able to download Torrents of Big Brother to get all caught up on Big Brother 8.
2947869	2947969	So...
2950618	2952159	and Jen Sucks, just for the record.
2953200	2954441	Shane, do you have any FUs of the Wii?
2956302	2957743	I could come up with one real quick.
2958063	2970852	FU to Blizzard for not giving me the expansion for free or telling me when it's going to come out because I really want it and it's really all I've been reading about since they announced it.
2971212	2975215	Me and the internet, that's all we do is just talk about the WoW expansion.
2977537	2977857	Alright.
2978657	2979518	Let's get back into some news.
2980396	2985779	Anyways, another cool game that's going to be heading our way pretty soon.
2985999	2990242	Crysis has been announced to be released on November 16th.
2990722	2992583	And that game looks damn good.
2993204	2994865	And I really want to build a PC for it.
2995825	2996986	Tell us a little more about this game.
2997006	2997747	I don't know much about it.
2998047	3001729	Crysis is the next game in the series of, I guess, Far Cry.
3002029	3003050	Even though there is Far Cry 2.
3003090	3003890	That's right, I've heard of this.
3004531	3008293	But it's just... I mean, the original Far Cry game was pretty good looking.
3008793	3009974	This one now is just...
3010816	3011597	Thanks for watching!
3032685	3036967	BoxArt right there looks like it's crazy, like 2,000 years in the future.
3037088	3038648	It's in the future, I'm assuming.
3039189	3043211	Basically, it's still on a tropical island type thing.
3043351	3055738	Aliens have either crash-landed in one section of the map, and so you have this whole section that's kind of zero-G and frozen, so it's interesting stuff there.
3055978	3059220	Plus, the whole suit that you have is like a nano-suit that you can upgrade to,
3059740	3066985	You can switch it to speed, so all your powers and your speed, and you can move around really fast, or armor, or stealth, and stuff like that.
3067926	3068626	Really cool looking.
3068826	3069787	That could be interesting.
3070767	3077111	Well, this is also interesting, and that is SingStar is continuing to do a lot of business and coming out with new games.
3077472	3078893	I guess this is mostly in Europe, though.
3078973	3081154	I have not heard of SingStar really taking off in this country.
3081174	3082675	There's another one coming out this month, actually.
3082695	3083376	My gosh.
3083436	3085537	SingStar amped in the U.S.
3085797	3087518	Maybe they are doing really well there.
3087878	3090759	And I think this is coming out in the U.S.
3090839	3091400	as well.
3092260	3094001	This is SingStar Anthems.
3094941	3097363	And it's actually, I gotta hand it to them.
3097403	3099304	This is actually a pretty kick-ass song list.
3099364	3104026	If you like your power ballads and your anthems, this is a pretty kick-ass song list.
3105266	3106927	Anastasia, Left Outside Alone.
3107047	3107968	I actually like that song.
3108028	3108968	Probably no one else has heard of it.
3109068	3110149	Avril Lavigne, I'm With You.
3110769	3112190	Cyndi Lauper, Time After Time.
3113190	3116851	You DDR fans, the original version of Ordinary World by Duran Duran is in this.
3117271	3118291	Alone by Heart.
3118651	3119792	That's a hell of a power ballad.
3120172	3121852	Two songs by Mr. Mister.
3122452	3123152	That's awesome.
3123432	3124253	You get broken wings.
3124933	3127133	And Queen, the show must go on.
3127213	3129214	Rock Set, a couple Rock Set songs in there.
3129234	3129874	What are Rock Set songs?
3129894	3131114	It must have been Love, of course.
3131134	3132335	But what's the other one?
3132375	3132955	Listen to Your Heart.
3133515	3133815	Oh.
3133995	3135495	I wanted Joyride.
3135655	3136135	I don't care.
3136155	3136956	That's not a power ballad.
3137136	3138116	It's the ultimate.
3138536	3140937	The ultimate power ballad, Meatloaf.
3141137	3143179	I'd do anything for love, but I wouldn't do that.
3143699	3144799	That is all kinds of awesome.
3144819	3150582	But I do agree with what Joystick said when they reported on this, and that would be, this game is shit without journey.
3150963	3153144	How can you have a ballads game and have no journey?
3154045	3155286	Where's my Don't Stop Believin'?
3155306	3156667	Is that on the Sony label?
3157087	3158047	Is it on the Sony label?
3158067	3160149	Because that's all they get are songs from the label.
3160169	3160909	Probably not, then.
3160929	3162250	I'm surprised Open Arms isn't on there.
3162490	3162850	I know!
3162950	3167393	How can you pay whatever it takes to get Open Arms in this game?
3167813	3168954	Or Don't Stop Believin'?
3168974	3171215	Sony can't afford to buy things right now.
3171255	3173396	They're all poor with the PS3 stuff.
3173416	3173917	Oh, whatever.
3174857	3177779	But if they want this game to take off, they will invest the money in it.
3177859	3179740	I'm curious to see what Chad says about this.
3180781	3180881	Uh...
3182754	3185717	Oh, no, they're still commenting on Crysis.
3185797	3190502	RossDLUT says, ooh, Crysis, a generic first-person shooter game with an extra graphical effort.
3192003	3193285	It's not that generic.
3193345	3194486	It looks pretty awesome.
3195247	3195687	Whatever.
3196388	3198590	SonOfDad says, karaoke in the U.S.
3198730	3199951	only belongs in bars.
3200987	3202308	Yeah, but what if you have a bar at home?
3202368	3203848	Like, you have a bunch of liquor at home.
3203868	3205029	That's acceptable, right?
3205169	3209971	That's false, because a lot of people I know love playing the karaoke games at parties and stuff.
3210011	3210851	It's really fun to do.
3211272	3213673	Robert M. suggests Foreigner, Poison.
3214513	3216774	Son of Dad also says he wants the final countdown.
3218251	3218631	Yes!
3218731	3221713	That'd be awesome.
3222033	3226434	I just got 2DX4thStyle finally, and I love that song so much.
3226454	3228135	Is that part of the Konami liquidation?
3228355	3228635	Yes.
3228675	3228955	Sale?
3229796	3231556	Brand new 2DX4thStyle.
3231636	3233457	The five-finger sale at Konami.
3233637	3235058	Whatever, it was free.
3237250	3239091	You know, I found something the other day, actually.
3239151	3239471	What?
3239611	3240651	I found it today.
3241152	3244253	I have a DDR Club append.
3244933	3246414	I don't even know where the hell that came from.
3246434	3247194	How random.
3247734	3248574	It might be mine.
3248715	3250195	I used to have both those games.
3250435	3250695	Maybe.
3250855	3253536	You probably have it from when we used to live together years ago.
3253636	3254937	No, I think Jamie gave it to me.
3255891	3257091	She gave you a Club of Pen?
3257131	3258592	I think those things are actually worth kind of money.
3258932	3259572	No, I doubt it.
3259712	3262013	Those are the DDR games nobody fucking played.
3262413	3263253	Who played Club of Pen?
3263273	3263393	I did.
3263413	3268854	I can't play it anyways because I don't have second mix, so it's completely useless to me.
3269034	3270455	It did have a lot of crap on it, though.
3270875	3273075	Let's talk about release dates, shall we?
3273195	3275976	And we'll travel to Europe first, even though Jamie's not here tonight.
3275996	3278516	I've got her back, and it's really not a long list this week.
3279617	3283898	On August 10th, over in Europe, you guys are getting Pac-Man Rally on the PSP.
3284818	3285879	The Game Named After Loki
3305578	3308759	You're ruining all the future release date list.
3308799	3309599	Jamie's going to be so angry.
3309639	3318102	I feel bad because there's only one freaking release this week, so I'm trying to give them something to look forward to because I don't think Europe is filled with Pac-Man Rally fans.
3318202	3321563	If it was, this is a huge release for them.
3321643	3328905	If I'm wrong, Europe folks, please send us an email, mailbag at orangeonline3.com and please tell us how much you love Pac-Man Rally and how you're going to be camping outside.
3329185	3331406	Send us your pictures from camping outside game.
3331426	3332266	I want to go camping.
3332486	3334307	Hey, you want to hear something?
3334787	3338129	You want to hear something about the stupid rally games that they have in Europe?
3338169	3342152	We keep getting fucking some, was it SVG or something?
3342332	3348575	One of these smaller distributors out there keeps publishing this European crap that comes over here.
3348615	3351837	For example, they have Crazy Frog Racer.
3352117	3355799	Because, ooh, we really need a game based off that annoying piece of shit.
3356040	3360222	Then there's this Kokoto Racer thing, which is like some little devil looking thing.
3361164	3361544	I don't know.
3361925	3363826	Too many kart racing games in Europe.
3365708	3372233	However, though, in the U.S., there's not a whole lot coming out this week, but there is a lot more than in the U.K.
3372974	3378238	For example, on PSP, we've got Crazy Taxi Fair Wars, also Tomb Raider Anniversary.
3378338	3379179	That's going to be coming out.
3379719	3387425	On the DS, you've got Mega Man, Star Force Pegasus, and Star Force Leo.
3387966	3390648	And if you're buying through GameStop, Star Force Dragon.
3393092	3399534	Also, we've got Glory Days 2, which is supposed to be a pretty good kind of a side-scroller strategy game.
3400674	3403695	On the Wii, Boogie is going to be coming out.
3403795	3408235	It's kind of a singing and karaoke game, or dancing and karaoke game.
3409916	3417037	PlayStation 3, nothing, although I do believe that Splinter Cell Double Agent I thought was coming out this week.
3417757	3418098	I don't know.
3418678	3419238	And then...
3421881	3422781	on PC.
3424502	3426803	Aw, no Tycoon game this week.
3427584	3428244	That's a first.
3428484	3428904	Damn.
3428924	3433206	You know, I was really hoping... Pac-Man Rally Tycoon is coming out on the PC.
3433306	3433626	Go figure.
3433646	3436648	No, there's Attack on Pearl Harbor, so that's kind of cool.
3437748	3438309	And, uh...
3439629	3439969	I don't know.
3440750	3441910	Start of Ender 3.
3442170	3442931	Woohoo.
3443851	3445332	Alright, well, coming out in Japan.
3445392	3450974	Japan's also kind of having a bit of a slow week when it comes to game releases, but they do have one big one that a lot of folks are looking forward to.
3451014	3455896	On the PlayStation 2, Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System is coming out this week.
3455956	3457657	The dumbest name for a game.
3458057	3460478	It's basically the International Zodiac Job System.
3460558	3461719	It's the international version.
3461919	3465861	Yeah, the international version that doesn't go anywhere but Japan.
3467362	3469023	It doesn't get released anywhere else.
3469283	3471745	I know, but there'll be people importing it.
3472165	3473666	I believe it's just the voiceovers.
3473807	3475228	You can select English options.
3475268	3476509	I don't think the text is English.
3476529	3479271	Oh, because that'd be awesome if it was in English because then you can import it.
3480352	3483714	Well, most of the other international versions is what people did.
3484155	3488078	Like Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix, just for chains of memories on PS2.
3488398	3489919	But the text wasn't English, I thought.
3489939	3490980	I thought it was just the voices.
3491881	3497005	I'm not sure, to be honest, because I already have Final Fantasy XII and I could care less about new systems.
3497125	3500128	But you get to do new international Zodiac jobs.
3500248	3500748	Yippee.
3501329	3502149	Whatever that means.
3502269	3508054	I think it meant that you're supposed to cater your characters to more like one classic class.
3508094	3511197	Like one of them is more like a red mage and the other one is more like a black mage.
3511417	3513179	They had new classes too or something.
3513379	3515260	Funny languages because it wasn't English.
3516621	3520724	Also coming out, which we should note, on the DS, the DS has a little bit more releases.
3521085	3522425	Of course, there's another Yu-Gi-Oh!
3522446	3523586	game coming out, Yu-Gi-Oh!
3523606	3525007	Dual Monsters GX.
3525548	3536836	And also coming out, we should say, on Nintendo's DS from Nintendo, Donkey Kong Jungle Climber, or the King of Swing, is coming out in Japan as well.
3536856	3539398	King of Swing 2, basically.
3539798	3540658	And looking at SP...
3544481	3546484	Hey, there's a professional Atlas travel guide.
3548166	3549607	That would be the most fun game ever.
3549888	3551550	I want to look up where Rome is at.
3551730	3554113	Wild Arms XF or Wild Arms Crossfire.
3554133	3555194	You can also look forward to that.
3555474	3556956	It's not as cool as Dust Cap 2.
3557557	3557877	I know.
3558077	3559259	Not as cool as Dust Cap 2.
3559799	3560200	Definitely.
3560360	3560820	Well, that's it.
3560900	3562963	That's all the release dates I'm going to care to name this week.
3563757	3575422	Well, one upcoming release that we're going to get some more information about at Tokyo Game Show this year is Metal Gear Solid 4, where it's rumored that the game will actually have a release date announced.
3577023	3579664	Although, we're probably guessing March right now.
3580565	3585787	So, we just had a story about naming a date where they're going to name a release date.
3586407	3586807	Damn it!
3586947	3587808	I did it again!
3589639	3593842	I thought we said no more of these stories about naming a date where they're going to have a date.
3593922	3594922	This is so stupid.
3595543	3595963	I'm sorry.
3596003	3597464	Why do people get excited about this?
3597504	3598084	No, it's okay.
3598504	3598905	Fired!
3600386	3601406	No, we can't fire Loki.
3601886	3603708	Or else where else would we record this week?
3603848	3604768	We'd be screwed.
3604908	3605308	Yeah.
3605769	3606049	Alright.
3607088	3609330	Some other things to note really quickly.
3609450	3611051	Some releases coming out in Europe.
3611612	3616957	Super Paper Mario is finally coming out in Europe on September 14th, speaking of dates.
3617397	3618058	Can you believe it?
3618799	3620500	It's coming out for £35 in Europe.
3620540	3620661	And, uh...
3625529	3626550	Pac-Man Rally Pac-Man Rally
3644932	3645914	Wait for Paper Mario.
3646496	3646816	I guess.
3646896	3649001	Okay, I guess you can get 35 pounds that way.
3649221	3655696	Now what is much more important that is on the Nintendo DS on September 14th over in Europe is...
3657044	3661046	Freshly picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland is finally coming out.
3661486	3662747	Loki, will you be importing it?
3662787	3674493	Because the great news is the DS is region free, even though there's no plans to release this game in the US yet, you can actually import this game still for probably about, I think I saw it listed somewhere for about 45 bucks if you want to get Tingle.
3674773	3675673	A waste of $45?
3676233	3676634	Why not?
3676674	3677874	Why won't you buy this game, Matt?
3677894	3678955	Why the hate for Tingle?
3679015	3680275	Because I don't like Tingle.
3680315	3681936	I think Tingle's a stupid character.
3682316	3683937	I didn't like him in Wind Waker.
3684417	3685278	Why the hell would I like him...
3686730	3689312	Now that he has his own game.
3689933	3690833	I wonder if the game is any good.
3690853	3692054	I haven't heard anything about it.
3692074	3694316	I don't think he's going to be in fucking Smash Bros.
3694396	3694876	Brawl.
3695517	3696578	As a playable character?
3697018	3698879	I'll never hear the fucking end of it.
3700000	3702642	Tingle's in fucking Smash Bros.
3702682	3703223	Check it out.
3703323	3704744	I don't think he'll be in it.
3704864	3706345	I don't think he'll be in it.
3706445	3708447	It's because I did his voice once.
3710068	3712790	And ever since then, it's just never ending.
3712830	3713651	Never ending.
3714264	3743833	it would be really weird to have him in it though because they're using all the Zelda things oh, do Tingle's voice, that'd be awesome they're using the Zelda things from Twilight Princess and even though I didn't beat the game I never saw Tingle there, so yeah, but he was in Wind Waker and I think he was in one of the Nintendo 64 ones he was in that crappy one, Majora's Mask but they've already covered Wind Waker and all that stuff, I thought but if they're giving him his own game they also fucking took Balloon Fight and made his own version of that, come on
3746129	3747871	It's quirky and weird in Japanese.
3748411	3749472	I hate the Japanese.
3749973	3753676	GS68 is in chat and says, Tingle as the Super Smash Bros.
3753716	3755978	Brawl character, will Loki get shot?
3759061	3760562	Wonderdog Harold has a suggestion.
3760983	3765407	Loki should just say he likes Tingle and then no one would bring up Tingle ever again.
3766488	3768329	I don't like Tingle though, that's the thing.
3769731	3770011	Alright.
3770396	3772998	And Shane is going to read tonight's mailbag.
3798499	3799200	Totally!
3799341	3801103	That should be interesting to say the least.
3801123	3803087	Watch out, because I might make fun of you.
3803307	3807394	Alright, so we'll be back in just a moment with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
