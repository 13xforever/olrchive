7000	27000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loko.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37000	43000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43000	49000	And yes, our show is a little bit broken tonight. I mean we were off for a week due to a studio move.
49000	53000	Meaning that the studio we used to record in is no more. It's gone.
53000	59000	And we're actually in a temporary location tonight. We call it Studio Loki.
59000	63000	And it's brought to us by the one and only Tech Master Loki who is also here on the program tonight.
63000	64000	Yes it is.
64000	65000	How are you doing Loki?
65000	70000	I'm doing okay and I'm still trying to untangle this microphone cord, but that's okay.
70000	75000	That's right. So if you notice some things are a little bit different tonight, like our opening was not its usual self.
75000	78000	And you know some other things, the sound might be a little bit different than what you're used to.
78000	81000	This is why, because we're in our temporary home. I'll get more into that in just a moment.
81000	85000	But I also want to introduce our other guests tonight. Say hello to Miklotov.
85000	90000	Wouldn't I be the first guest tonight? Because you said the other guest and you just introduced Loki.
90000	93000	One of our other guests. I'm sorry. I'm totally out of it tonight.
93000	95000	Obviously. Hello.
95000	101000	All right. And also say hello. Gosh, you're mean tonight. And say hello to another guest.
101000	102000	Extifer.
102000	106000	But it's fitting though, right? I mean, Shane's always mean.
106000	107000	I'm always mean.
107000	112000	All right. And I'm sure you guys are probably asking what happened to Dark Zagrow? Where is she?
112000	115000	Oh my God. What happened to her? Oh my God.
115000	119000	Actually, she's had some family issues this week. She had a death in the family, unfortunately.
119000	123000	So she's tending to those issues tonight. So obviously our thoughts are with her.
123000	130000	So yet another reason why our show is in chaos tonight is that, you know, Jamie had to pull out at the last second, which we can obviously understand.
130000	133000	But she should be back next week with us here at Orange Lawn Radio.
133000	138000	But I know the listeners and ourselves. We're all thinking her and her family this week.
138000	144000	Meanwhile, let's talk about what's going on with the show is that basically we moved.
144000	148000	And of course, the show taped out of the spare bedroom at the apartment I used to share with Extifer.
148000	152000	Well, we've moved on and Extifer's moved and I've moved into a new house.
152000	156000	And the cool thing is, is that we're going to tape out of the garage now. So it's going to be like this huge studio.
156000	160000	But here's the problem. We tried to call Comcast to get an appointment like a week before we moved.
160000	164000	Like just after we taped the last show and they said they would not come out until like August 7th.
164000	169000	So we were screwed with no internet. It has been hell trying to have internet at the house for this week.
169000	174000	There's been like nothing. Stolen Wi-Fi. That's it. And we couldn't broadcast a show off of stolen Wi-Fi.
174000	178000	So we had to move to a temporary home this week. So that's why we're at Studio Loki tonight.
178000	180000	And things are a little crazy.
180000	181000	Yeah.
181000	183000	But that's OK. We didn't want to go two weeks of not having a show.
183000	189000	I mean, because we seriously considered it because of everything going on with Jamie and going on at the other studio.
189000	195000	But we just didn't want to have to go two weeks with no show because that can sometimes be suicide for listeners and everything.
195000	197000	We really appreciate those of you guys sticking with us.
197000	201000	Of course, we are in chat. We have everything up. We should hopefully still have Skype line tonight.
201000	204000	Chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to join us in the chat room.
204000	206000	And of course, lots of gaming news tonight.
206000	210000	Loki's got something really big he wants to talk about in Part B. It's going to be really cool.
210000	212000	So we'll talk about that a little later.
212000	216000	And all right. Let's get into how was your gaming week.
216000	218000	So we'll start off. How was your gaming week, Loki?
218000	223000	Extremely busy. That's basically how I can describe it.
223000	230000	I played so much crap over the last few days, or actually the last couple of weeks, that it's just ridiculous.
230000	232000	Well, let's start off with the PSP stuff.
232000	236000	I went back and played through a little bit more of WTF.
236000	241000	And that game is weird. The more games I unlock, the weirder the game gets.
241000	246000	And it's awesome, though. I recommend checking it out. It's probably dirt cheap by now.
246000	251000	Another game I played actually just came out in the UK called State Shift.
251000	254000	It's kind of a futuristic racing game.
254000	260000	I guess a little bit like Wipeout, but it's with cars or these futuristic vehicles.
260000	266000	Didn't care for it too much. The cars drive like giant bricks with rockets on them.
266000	269000	And it was impossible to make corners and stuff.
269000	273000	So not a game I would pick up, but then again, I'm not in the UK, so it doesn't matter.
273000	279000	Final Fantasy, I finished it finally, and I'm so glad I'm finished with it,
279000	284000	because those new dungeons that they added on with the PlayStation 1 release, it's just crap.
284000	287000	It's just like, oh, we need some dungeons, quick, let's make some.
287000	291000	I mean, and they have no continuity whatsoever, just crap.
291000	294000	And I was so pissed off at the game, so that's done.
294000	298000	Final Fantasy II, I played it for about five minutes, turned it off, because I didn't want to play it anymore.
298000	301000	The battle system is just not good.
301000	305000	What? I love Final Fantasy II. I played it on the Game Boy Advance a lot. You don't like it?
305000	306000	I don't like it.
306000	312000	But you know, for me though, I think Final Fantasy XI takes a lot from Final Fantasy II,
312000	317000	like in regards to the whole job systems and stuff, the way you kind of level your characters.
317000	319000	Maybe I'll try it again, but yeah.
319000	322000	I love Final Fantasy II. I think it's more fun than Final Fantasy I.
322000	324000	I can't wait to play the PSP port.
324000	327000	Wait, so you have Final Fantasy II on PSP, and you're not playing it?
327000	328000	Yeah.
328000	330000	I think you should let me have it for a little while.
330000	332000	Might be fun. I have no internet at home. Take pity on me.
332000	333000	Maybe.
333000	334000	Alright.
334000	340000	Anyways, so beyond the PSP, on the 360, I played quite a few things, including some demos.
340000	348000	I tried the demo for Beautiful Katamari, which a lot of people don't know is actually out there.
348000	353000	It's not on live, but if you happen to subscribe to the official Xbox magazine,
353000	357000	there is a demo disc for Beautiful Katamari in the September issue.
357000	361000	It is extremely short. It's only three minutes long, but goddamn do I want that game.
361000	363000	It's beautiful.
363000	365000	How beautiful Katamari.
365000	369000	The other thing, let's see, I played Darkness.
369000	372000	That one looks okay. It looks like a pretty good game.
372000	374000	The demo kind of sucked, though.
374000	378000	I don't know. Not what I'm going to buy, but I'd probably rent it.
378000	382000	I did buy Overlord, and that game I played the demo of, and I thought,
382000	385000	oh, I'm probably going to get pretty bored of this really quick.
385000	387000	Actually, I'm pretty surprised.
387000	391000	I've been playing it quite a bit, and at first you're like,
391000	396000	well, maybe it should be slightly good because then the townsfolk will help you out with stuff.
396000	402000	Then eventually they start pissing you off, and I think that they programmed that game that way on purpose.
402000	406000	So I just go through the towns and basically kill everybody, and I can do that over and over.
406000	409000	I've got my wenches, and it's awesome.
409000	418000	And then, let's see, I also, on the PlayStation 3, I got my import copy of Wengen Midnight.
418000	420000	And that's pretty cool.
420000	424000	The game itself, though, graphically looks like a PlayStation 2 game.
424000	426000	That's probably the only disappointing thing about it.
426000	430000	Otherwise, I guess it's exactly like the arcade game.
430000	433000	Do you think they were originally building it for PlayStation 2 and just decided to...
433000	438000	It came out for PlayStation 2 last year, but it's not...
438000	444000	I mean, the graphics, if you were to put it up against Knee for Speed or Juiced or something like that,
444000	447000	it would horribly fail.
447000	449000	It's just, I don't know.
449000	454000	It kind of went a little lazy there, but otherwise, it's an okay game.
454000	456000	Worth checking out a little bit more.
456000	461000	Unfortunately, the whole story mode in the game is all Japanese, so I don't really understand any of it.
461000	464000	But I figure it's just racing, so it can't be that hard.
464000	470000	God, I know there was some other stuff I played, but I can't remember.
470000	472000	Those are basically the main things.
472000	474000	All right, moving on.
474000	477000	MyGamingWeek, and I'm looking at chatroom at chat.orangelandrater.com.
477000	480000	Jvmon says, Skye must be dying without World of Warcraft.
480000	484000	You know, I wasn't until I heard all the news from BlizzCon this week, which we'll get into in a little bit.
484000	487000	Nexfer is going to give us a report because he was there at BlizzCon.
487000	492000	And then when I heard all of that, I was like, I have to give my character to 70.
492000	497000	But before BlizzCon happened, I was doing okay with no World of Warcraft, because I was busy moving.
497000	500000	Like, you know, when you have all this stuff, you've got to get out of another place.
500000	503000	And believe me, I have a lot of crap, okay? I have a lot of crap.
503000	506000	So moving that kind of kept me busy and kept my mind off, wow.
506000	511000	But when I did finally get everything settled in and I had no internet, that didn't leave a whole lot to play.
511000	514000	So I went back to old PlayStation 2 games that I never really finished,
514000	516000	and the first one that came to mind was Kingdom Hearts 2,
516000	521000	because I played that game quite a ways in before the first time I played it, and then just kind of stopped.
521000	525000	So I'm just restarting that, and I pretty much caught up to where I was.
525000	531000	And, you know, Kingdom Hearts 2, yeah, I guess its biggest downfall is that the battle system is kind of a bit of button mashing,
531000	533000	and it's nothing that intuitive.
533000	536000	But I'll be damned if you don't just kind of immerse yourself in the world,
536000	538000	and the way they tie things together is so great.
538000	541000	And the voice acting is pretty darn good, except for Aerith, I hate her.
541000	547000	And everything else, the music and the graphics and the full motions, it's a great game.
547000	549000	One of my favorite PlayStation 2 games.
549000	553000	I remember the other game I played, Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3, I played the demo for that.
553000	554000	Oh, the demo, how was that?
554000	559000	It was very short, again, but it kind of reminds me a little bit of God of War,
559000	565000	but it's a whole lot of button mashing, it seems like, because it's basically two buttons that you do certain moves with,
565000	567000	and you can switch your weapon up a little bit.
567000	572000	But, I don't know, I'm probably going to pick it up, just because there's not a whole lot coming out for the PlayStation 3,
572000	576000	so, you know, it's worth my money.
576000	583000	Interesting comment, Dark Tetsuya says, Kingdom Hearts 3 should use something along the lines of Final Fantasy 12.
583000	588000	Final Fantasy 12 did have a pretty awesome battle system, but I don't know if it would work in the Kingdom Hearts universe.
588000	592000	But a lot of people think that Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be different, because I believe the creator has said,
592000	597000	Kingdom Hearts 3 is not Kingdom Hearts 3, it's something else in the Kingdom Hearts universe.
597000	600000	So, we'll see, it's still a ways out before they announce anything.
600000	606000	Raven's Dolphin in chat says, Sky got so much stuff, moving a lot of gay porn books takes a lot of space.
606000	608000	You would know, Raven's Dolphin, you would.
608000	613000	Mikotov, how was your gaming week? What kind of games did you play this week?
613000	617000	Well, I'll start with Sunday, I was at Comic Con, so...
617000	621000	I was going to ask you to give us the Comic Con reports, since you weren't here last week. How was that?
621000	623000	Boring. I don't like comics.
623000	626000	Why did you go to Comic Con?
626000	630000	I went for Heroes and Battlestar, and I was happy with both of those.
630000	638000	But I got to play Silent Hill Origins, and I haven't played that since it was the behind the shoulder camera.
638000	641000	And it's actually looking really good, and it was really fun.
641000	647000	It wasn't really scary, because it's in a bright room with a lot of people, and you're playing it on a PSP.
647000	649000	But whatever, it was still cool.
649000	653000	Other than that, I played World of Warcraft.
653000	659000	And I played Loki's demo of Beautiful Katamari, and that's really it.
659000	661000	Did you enjoy Beautiful Katamari?
661000	663000	Yes, it was a really fun three minutes.
663000	665000	Best three minutes you ever spent?
665000	668000	No, but it was a fun three minutes.
668000	670000	What would be the best three minutes you ever spent?
670000	671000	Next question.
671000	673000	Oh my, alright. Game-wise, game-wise.
673000	675000	Next question.
675000	678000	Fine. Jerk. Alright, so that's it for your gaming week?
678000	681000	I think so, I didn't really do much.
681000	683000	I never do much with WoW.
683000	687000	You've all been pretty boring between, you know, moving and all this other stuff.
687000	689000	Hiding my office clothes.
689000	690000	You've been moving out of your office.
690000	691000	Yeah.
691000	692000	Is everything okay? You doing alright?
692000	693000	Yeah.
693000	696000	Was there any last hurrah? Did everybody go out for drinks one last time or anything?
696000	700000	No, actually. Nobody went out for drinks. It was weird.
700000	701000	Alright.
701000	704000	We normally drink for no reason. This was a reason and nobody drank.
704000	707000	I hope I'm okay to say this on the show, though, but as I understand,
707000	711000	there's little bits and pieces that you collected for listeners in the future.
711000	714000	Yeah, and I'll give those to you to give away.
714000	719000	So, more information at a later date on you can own a piece of what once was Konami.
719000	721000	Aw, it's so sad.
721000	722000	How sad.
722000	723000	Alright.
723000	724000	Why are we laughing?
724000	725000	I'm sorry.
725000	726000	It's the seven legged lamb I'm looking at. Look how adorable.
726000	732000	It's actually really, it really is sad because I know we had a lot of friends that worked there like yourself, so it sucks.
732000	733000	Yeah, it's just me.
733000	735000	It'd be better if it was a chicken because, you know.
735000	736000	They had to kill it because it couldn't be.
736000	738000	What in the hell are you guys looking at?
738000	739000	This is the worst.
739000	740000	Seven legged lamb.
740000	743000	This is the worst radio ever. You're showing pictures of a seven legged lamb in studio.
743000	744000	Because it can't poop.
744000	745000	Alright.
747000	748000	What?
748000	750000	They had to kill it because it couldn't poop.
750000	751000	Seven legs and no ass.
751000	753000	And it was a hermaphrodite.
753000	755000	Why are you reading Perez Hilton during this show?
755000	756000	I don't know.
756000	757000	That has nothing to do with gaming.
757000	764000	Last time I saw a zombie reindeer, one that had frozen and rotted away and it looked like a zombie reindeer.
764000	765000	Wow.
765000	766000	Next.
766000	769000	Oh my gosh, this is the worst radio.
769000	771000	Yes, Dark Tetsuya summed it up in chat.
771000	772000	Worst radio ever.
772000	773000	Thank you very much.
773000	774000	Whenever you're the worst radio ever.
774000	777000	This will be the last show from Studio Loki because this is what happens to the show.
777000	778000	Alright, anyhow.
778000	780000	Housekeeping real quick.
780000	785000	We weren't here last week so we weren't able to tell you guys that we got nominated in the podcast awards at podcastawards.com.
785000	788000	So thank you guys very much for helping us to get the nominations.
788000	789000	And the voting is now open.
789000	794000	So if you head on over to www.podcastawards.com, you can vote for Orange Lawn Radio.
794000	796000	We're nominated for best gaming podcast.
796000	799000	And it's really cool because like lots of independent podcasts are nominated.
799000	803000	They upped it from 5 to 10 this year and there's like lots of independent podcasts nominated.
803000	805000	Like a lot of good shows, including our good buddies at All Games.
805000	806000	Yeah.
806000	811000	And they are whoring now that they're trying to get people to vote every day.
811000	820000	Yes, you can vote every day and I know that even though they've kind of made it seem like that there is some sort of prevention against automated voting and stuff.
820000	824000	You can vote once per day, once per e-mail.
824000	832000	So just make sure that you're checking your e-mail to hit those confirmation e-mails.
832000	833000	Just do it legitimately.
833000	834000	Don't cheat.
834000	835000	It is legitimate.
835000	837000	No, I was just going to say it gives us a bad name.
837000	838000	It is legitimate.
838000	839000	No, I'm saying for the people out there.
839000	840000	I know.
840000	841000	Be legit and ethical.
841000	842000	I'm not saying use a program to do it or anything.
842000	843000	Don't.
843000	844000	Please don't.
844000	849000	I'm just saying, you know, if you have e-mail addresses you can vote four times.
849000	857000	Seriously, people that are listening to gaming podcasts are probably so fucking sick about hearing about podcast awards.
857000	858000	So, you know.
858000	861000	Well, it was just nice to be nominated again.
861000	862000	Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
862000	863000	It's always lovely to be nominated.
863000	865000	But we want to win again, so.
865000	867000	You know what's better than being nominated again?
867000	868000	Winning again.
868000	869000	That's what's even better.
869000	871000	No, I'm just teasing, really.
871000	878000	No, it really is great that we got nominated and the fact that there's like a lot of shows that haven't been in there before and it's all independent.
878000	880000	I hoard us out to my work again.
880000	888000	Those people, those people that do the shows that got nominated, you know, they don't get a lot of, I don't think any of them, I don't think any of them get paid to do their business.
888000	890000	Screw Attack was on there.
890000	891000	Do they?
891000	892000	I don't know.
892000	893000	I don't even know.
893000	896000	Well, they're affiliated with, you know, game trailers.
896000	899000	But hey, at least One Up wasn't on there.
899000	901000	You know, at least like IGN wasn't on there.
901000	904000	Picking fights today with the corporate cast.
904000	906000	Well, technically they're video casts.
906000	907000	I don't know if that's true.
907000	908000	I mean, they get paid to do what they do.
908000	912000	So they are, and they have built-in ads and magazines and stuff.
912000	915000	So all the casts that got nominated, you know, they don't get that same built-in advertising.
915000	916000	We need this.
916000	917000	Yeah, we need this.
917000	918000	So do they.
918000	920000	So hooray for nominations.
920000	924000	Okay, we need to change the topic.
924000	927000	Moving on, let's talk about some gaming news.
927000	930000	We'll start it off with a little bit of news from BlizzCon.
930000	932000	Of course, that's the big weekend news.
932000	937000	And we're going to go over to Xtavor for a full report, but first, if you haven't already heard,
937000	939000	here's some of the news that came out of BlizzCon.
939000	941000	Wrath of the Lich King, or Lich King.
941000	943000	Wrath of the Lich King.
943000	945000	It looks like Lich King.
945000	947000	The Lush King.
947000	948000	I like that.
948000	950000	How about Wrath of the Lich King?
950000	951000	Have you ever played WoW Drunk?
951000	953000	How about Wrath of the Lush King?
953000	955000	I've played Final Fantasy Drunk, but not WoW.
955000	957000	I think I've played WoW Drunk.
957000	958000	You've played WoW Drunk.
958000	960000	Yeah, because I sang on Ventrilo.
960000	961000	Wrath of the Dawn King.
961000	965000	So if you're a Mieglatov, it's Wrath of the Lush King, is the new WoW expansion.
965000	971000	And even though there's going to be no new races, there is going to be a new class, Death Knight.
971000	972000	So that's kind of fun.
972000	976000	And apparently every race can be a Death Knight, so there's going to be lots of Death Knights.
976000	979000	And I've already reserved the name Death Cake, so you can't have it, for Death Knight.
979000	985000	Well, I was just going to say, you know, if you were like, say, Leroy Jenkins and he was a knight,
985000	990000	he would be a Death Knight, because he's dead in the game, because he got killed.
990000	994000	Anyways, what's not funny though, is the fact that you may need Burning Crusade,
994000	999000	in order to play some aspects of Wrath of the Lich King.
999000	1003000	Which is not surprising, because I think with Burning Crusade it did raise the level cap,
1003000	1010000	and obviously you're not going to be able to go to 80 if you don't have Burning Crusade.
1010000	1017000	But, they haven't really said exactly what will not be available if you don't have Burning Crusade.
1017000	1020000	Well also, it should be pointed out, there's some new battlegrounds,
1020000	1024000	and it's going to have siege warfare and buildings that you can destroy with your siege weapons,
1024000	1026000	so that's going to be pretty awesome.
1026000	1029000	And then supposedly you're going to be able to customize your characters even further than what you can do now.
1029000	1031000	Yes, new hair, I can't wait.
1031000	1033000	That's good, because it is kind of limited right now.
1033000	1035000	You know what the best thing so far about the expansion is?
1035000	1036000	What?
1036000	1039000	It's blue, like crazy. I cannot wait.
1039000	1041000	Because it's ice and cold and all that stuff.
1041000	1044000	Yes, it's snowy, and I'm so excited. I could talk for hours about it,
1044000	1047000	but I guess it's Christopher's job because he went there.
1047000	1050000	Well, let's talk to Christopher. How was BlizzCon, Xtavor?
1050000	1052000	First of all, how did you go? It was a birthday thing, right?
1052000	1054000	Yeah, my sister got it for me for my birthday.
1054000	1057000	Oh, that was sweet, and didn't think to invite us. That's alright.
1057000	1058000	I know.
1058000	1060000	But it's $100 per ticket.
1060000	1063000	We would have bought it. We would have bought it now. We were moving. It's all good.
1063000	1068000	Well, tell us about, what was it like when he got there? What kind of stuff did they have going on?
1068000	1075000	Well, we got there pretty early in the morning on Friday morning because we wanted to get our badges,
1075000	1083000	and found out that there wasn't no lines for badges because they had booths everywhere to get your badge.
1083000	1086000	A lot of people had been there since 4 o'clock in the morning anyway,
1086000	1093000	so we just went up, got our badges, got our swag bags, and waited for the doors to open.
1093000	1098000	They opened the doors. When you walked in, it was really dark.
1098000	1106000	You could see the main hall, which is where they announced the expansion, and it was in bright blue.
1106000	1107000	Yay, blue!
1107000	1112000	They had two big screens and a lot of chairs.
1112000	1119000	Everybody filled up the chairs and people were standing on the sidelines.
1119000	1121000	People were blocking everybody's view.
1121000	1125000	The people that worked there weren't that great at directing everybody.
1125000	1129000	People kept on trying to sit down in the middle of the aisles.
1129000	1133000	They would sit there for 10 minutes before the people that worked there would tell them to get up.
1133000	1136000	Anyways, the opening ceremony was pretty good.
1136000	1144000	They talked about a lot of stuff, Starcraft 2, World of Warcraft, and they showed us the trailer to the expansion.
1144000	1146000	That was pretty cool.
1146000	1151000	I think everybody knew that the expansion was going to be called Wrath of the Lich King,
1151000	1158000	because in our maps, there was a specific area that said World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King area.
1158000	1161000	Everybody was clued in as to what was coming.
1161000	1164000	Plus, it had been leaked to the internet two days before.
1164000	1169000	While you all were driving down, the whole internet knew thanks to some European thing.
1169000	1173000	I guess the official Blizzard site in Europe leaked it.
1173000	1176000	So we all know it was Wrath of the Lich King.
1176000	1180000	Yeah, still some people were skeptical. They thought it was going to be Maelstrom.
1180000	1182000	But, I don't know.
1182000	1185000	The Wrath of the Lich King, we got to play it three times.
1185000	1188000	I personally really liked it.
1188000	1190000	What was the demo like? What did you do in it?
1190000	1195000	Well, you start out in the Undercity area and you fly on a...
1197000	1199000	Whatever that is.
1199000	1203000	I think your computer just farted.
1203000	1210000	Okay, for those people not in the studio, that's the pipes from someone next door.
1210000	1212000	They're using it and there's air in the pipes.
1212000	1213000	That was a cool noise.
1213000	1214000	That was a Silent Hill noise.
1214000	1215000	That was freaky.
1215000	1216000	I wish the folks at home could hear that.
1216000	1217000	Alright, so expansion.
1217000	1219000	Yeah, we got to play the expansion.
1219000	1225000	We start out in Undercity, ride a zeppelin to the new Northrend area.
1225000	1228000	You don't really know where it is in Northrend, but just that it's in Northrend.
1228000	1232000	And it's the Howling Fjord or whatever?
1232000	1234000	Yes, that's correct.
1234000	1235000	I just couldn't remember.
1235000	1238000	There were so many names that you discovered in the expansion.
1238000	1240000	We didn't know where we were.
1240000	1244000	And pretty much you go to this grassy type area first.
1244000	1248000	There's a town and you're next to the ocean.
1248000	1253000	And you can go up, you ride this lift up to the top.
1253000	1257000	And there's actually in the trailer for Wrath of the Lich King, you see the top of the lift.
1257000	1262000	So you're kind of excited because you're playing a part that's in the trailer.
1262000	1265000	Then you can go to the right.
1265000	1268000	There's a lot of snowy area you can go into.
1268000	1272000	And then there was a lot of burning woodsy areas.
1272000	1273000	Okay, too much detail.
1273000	1274000	Did they let you play Death Knight?
1274000	1275000	Did they let you?
1275000	1278000	No, they don't let you play Death Knight.
1278000	1282000	But they did play that trailer over and over and over and over again.
1282000	1286000	Did you get to do anything in the demo that you can't really already do in WoW right now?
1286000	1287000	That's, yeah.
1287000	1289000	That's nothing really new.
1289000	1292000	You can do quests, but they weren't really new.
1292000	1295000	You could tell that they were holding off on that stuff.
1295000	1298000	It was just really kind of a way to explore the area.
1298000	1300000	There was a dungeon you can go to.
1300000	1301000	And so lots of nerds could go.
1301000	1305000	You know, I played it first before any of you did in my Murloc suit.
1305000	1308000	Really, I would say it was a good start.
1308000	1309000	Good start because you could...
1309000	1310000	Good effort.
1310000	1311000	Yeah, good effort.
1311000	1315000	And it wasn't like you couldn't go to the other areas that were already there.
1315000	1319000	Because one of our players is a mage who can portal you.
1319000	1321000	And he portaled us to another city.
1321000	1323000	And it was kind of cool because we were the only three people there.
1323000	1325000	So yeah, it was kind of cool.
1325000	1326000	Cool.
1326000	1327000	How about StarCraft II?
1327000	1328000	Did you get a chance to play that?
1328000	1329000	Yeah.
1329000	1330000	StarCraft II.
1330000	1334000	I've never played StarCraft before, let alone any game like StarCraft.
1334000	1337000	So I was new to the whole genre.
1337000	1339000	But I can say that I really liked it.
1339000	1342000	I really enjoyed it.
1342000	1343000	Very good graphics.
1343000	1344000	Very good.
1344000	1346000	Lots of detail.
1346000	1348000	Very hard, I can imagine.
1348000	1350000	I was on easy mode and it was hard.
1350000	1351000	It was difficult.
1351000	1352000	But you were just a noob, that's why.
1352000	1353000	Yeah, yeah.
1353000	1354000	But I mean, yeah.
1354000	1355000	That's right.
1355000	1358000	But it was pretty cool.
1358000	1360000	And there was...
1360000	1362000	The whole area was just...
1362000	1364000	It was just people everywhere.
1364000	1365000	There were stores.
1365000	1366000	There were lots of stinky people.
1366000	1368000	Lots of stinky con people.
1368000	1371000	Actually, there were people from all walks of life.
1371000	1372000	There were families there.
1372000	1373000	Full families.
1373000	1375000	There were all fucking alliances.
1375000	1378000	But that's besides the point.
1378000	1379000	There were families there.
1379000	1385000	There were people that were fat and nasty there.
1385000	1386000	There were nerds.
1386000	1387000	Just skinny, scrawny nerds.
1387000	1389000	There were hot people.
1389000	1392000	I mean, people dressed in blood elf costumes.
1392000	1395000	Yeah, you were saying before that Leroy Jenkins,
1395000	1396000	the guy that does Leroy Jenkins,
1396000	1397000	was there because...
1397000	1398000	He was there.
1398000	1399000	You were like...
1399000	1400000	He was fucking hot.
1400000	1401000	...wetting your pants over that guy.
1401000	1402000	Yeah.
1402000	1403000	He actually...
1403000	1408000	Okay, Jay Moore, who was the DJ of the whole event...
1408000	1411000	He did a last comic standing, right?
1411000	1412000	Yeah.
1412000	1414000	Before he got fired.
1414000	1415000	He actually...
1415000	1417000	He did a really good job.
1417000	1422000	There were some hecklers that derailed the closing ceremony for a little bit.
1422000	1424000	But he pulled it together.
1424000	1425000	Everybody was laughing.
1425000	1427000	He made even the most skeptical people.
1427000	1431000	There was one girl behind me that was ragging on him the whole time,
1431000	1433000	and then she started laughing by the end of the show.
1433000	1435000	So he was actually pretty good.
1435000	1436000	I actually enjoyed him.
1436000	1439000	Had he ever played World of Warcraft or was it just a paycheck?
1439000	1443000	I think it was just a paycheck, but he did know some things.
1443000	1445000	But yeah, there were...
1445000	1448000	There was probably stuff that they told him in the boardroom or whatever
1448000	1450000	before he walked out.
1450000	1451000	But...
1451000	1453000	DJ Dark Knight in chat wants to know,
1453000	1454000	were there Korean players there?
1454000	1457000	But he's no Jamie Kennedy, that's for sure.
1457000	1461000	Actually, there were Korean players there.
1461000	1464000	Mostly for StarCraft, but there were people that won
1464000	1470000	the costume contests in the Korean Invitational that they did a few months ago,
1470000	1472000	or a month ago or whatever.
1472000	1475000	They actually participated in the costume contest this year,
1475000	1477000	and it was a warlock and they were done very well,
1477000	1480000	but it just so happens there was another warlock that topped them.
1480000	1482000	And she was just incredible.
1482000	1485000	She was like, oh my god, she looked incredible.
1485000	1489000	But yeah, the Leroy Jenkins guy was there,
1489000	1493000	and he did his Leroy Jenkins, and he was just too hot for words.
1493000	1494000	Wow, nerdy.
1494000	1496000	How was video games live?
1496000	1497000	Awesome.
1497000	1501000	They did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft, as you can imagine,
1501000	1502000	but they also...
1502000	1504000	Yeah, that's the one who won, I'm sorry.
1504000	1508000	Anyways, they did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft,
1508000	1511000	but they also did the new music from StarCraft II,
1511000	1514000	which was sucky because it sounded exactly like Star Wars.
1514000	1519000	But we got to hear that, and we got to hear lots of music from Diablo,
1519000	1524000	and there was also a band that played last night.
1524000	1526000	They were like this horde band.
1526000	1529000	It was totally manufactured by the makers of WoW,
1529000	1531000	you could tell because the creator of WoW was in the band.
1531000	1534000	But nevertheless, they were funny.
1534000	1535000	What were they called? Level 70?
1535000	1537000	Level 70 Elite, Tauren Chieftain.
1537000	1540000	Did they actually dress up like Tauren?
1540000	1541000	No, they actually didn't.
1541000	1542000	Like they were Gwar or something?
1542000	1543000	They didn't, but they did.
1543000	1547000	When you went and waited in the line to play Wrath of the Lich King,
1547000	1549000	there was a big screen next to them,
1549000	1552000	and they kept playing the video that was game made.
1552000	1555000	They made it in the in-game video for that,
1555000	1559000	and it was just incredibly ridiculous, but it was funny, I guess.
1559000	1563000	But they have a song called Rogues Do It From Behind,
1563000	1566000	which was just funny because I'm a rogue,
1566000	1569000	and I do it from behind.
1569000	1571000	I think I just threw up in my mouth, thank you.
1571000	1572000	I was going for that.
1572000	1577000	If only there was a camera to capture everybody's expressions just then.
1577000	1580000	So yeah, the whole show was pretty good.
1580000	1582000	I had such a fun time.
1582000	1584000	Good deal. Anything else you want to share
1584000	1585000	that you think our listeners ought to know about?
1585000	1587000	What was the funniest thing that happened all show?
1587000	1588000	The funniest thing?
1588000	1589000	Yeah.
1589000	1593000	Oh God, all the nerds asking stupid questions at the panels.
1593000	1595000	They would say stuff like,
1595000	1597000	okay, we're not going to answer these questions,
1597000	1599000	and what do the nerds fucking do?
1599000	1600000	Give us an example.
1600000	1602000	The movie panel, you said which one, right?
1602000	1604000	Movie panel, okay, that was a big thing.
1604000	1605000	They're actually doing a movie,
1605000	1608000	the same people who did Batman Returns,
1608000	1615000	or Batman Begins, Superman Returns, legendary 300 or whatever.
1615000	1620000	They are doing the movie, and they are really standing by this film.
1620000	1624000	There were questions that they wouldn't answer, though,
1624000	1626000	and those were,
1626000	1631000	we won't answer questions on which races, which characters will be in the movies,
1631000	1633000	but you can expect to maybe see these,
1633000	1635000	and they listed these characters, right?
1635000	1636000	Everybody cheered.
1636000	1639000	Okay, then the question answer comes,
1639000	1641000	what do the fucking gamers ask?
1641000	1644000	What races and characters are going to be in the game?
1644000	1646000	Can you please tell us?
1646000	1647000	Okay, didn't you fucking hear?
1647000	1650000	You're wasting our time when other people can be asking,
1650000	1652000	like, actually informative questions, you know?
1652000	1655000	So it was kind of, you know, annoying,
1655000	1658000	but Dark Knight wants to know, he would have asked,
1658000	1663000	and will we be hearing back me wool in the movie anywhere?
1663000	1664000	We should.
1664000	1666000	Get in the archives if you don't get that joke.
1666000	1669000	In fact, they said that there's going to be a lot of humor carried over from the game,
1669000	1673000	so they're looking forward to carrying some of the humor,
1673000	1675000	but still keep it on a serious level.
1675000	1678000	You didn't tell them about what the worst part of the movie is so far.
1678000	1680000	Oh, well, they're going to tell it from the Alliance perspective.
1680000	1682000	Boo, Alliance sucks.
1682000	1685000	Yeah, and the funny thing about it is that most people there,
1685000	1689000	we got the feeling that most people there were in the Horde,
1689000	1692000	which is funny because most people that play the game are Alliance,
1692000	1695000	but they're all kids that can't afford to go to BlizzCon.
1695000	1699000	Son of Dad is in chat, wants to know who's directing the film, did they say?
1699000	1702000	They don't have a director. There was somebody that asked that.
1702000	1708000	They want to get the script all together first before they go search for a director,
1708000	1711000	and he said, oh, there was a funny story.
1711000	1719000	The guy that is with Legendary said that the guy who played Superman last year,
1719000	1721000	he said they won't go into casting details,
1721000	1727000	but they did say that last year he overheard the Legendary people on the phone with the WoW people,
1727000	1733000	and he said, oh, my God, can you get me a backstage tour of where they do WoW and all this stuff,
1733000	1735000	and they did, and he went.
1735000	1738000	I seem to remember hearing something about that that guy was a WoW player,
1738000	1740000	the guy who was Superman. Funny.
1740000	1742000	Oh, he'd make a pretty blood elf.
1742000	1743000	Yeah, he would.
1743000	1751000	Oh, they did give kind of a, not a spoiler, but they gave us an idea of where they're going with the film.
1751000	1759000	The very end of the panel, they showed a picture, which is an artist's rendition of what might go on,
1759000	1763000	and they showed, what is it, the tree, the big tree?
1763000	1765000	Oh, tell the blah, blah, blah.
1765000	1768000	Yeah, the night elf tree. I can't remember. I'm not Alliance.
1768000	1773000	Whatever. Fuck it. But it was a really pretty picture, and everybody went crazy.
1773000	1775000	So, telladristle. That's what it is.
1775000	1776000	Something like that, yeah.
1776000	1778000	Yeah, but it was really fun.
1778000	1784000	And I recommend, I think that the best part, well, one of the best parts for me besides the expansion
1784000	1789000	was the fact that I actually did like StarCraft II. I think people should give it a try if you haven't.
1789000	1795000	I also miss the boat on StarCraft I, but what's crazy is that my boyfriend loves StarCraft.
1795000	1801000	It's like the only video game he plays is StarCraft, and he is all excited about StarCraft II.
1801000	1802000	So, it's just kind of interesting.
1802000	1803000	Because he's Asian.
1803000	1808000	Shut up. Let's see, looking at chat, another comment here.
1808000	1811000	Darktitsui wants to know, will the WoW movie be 60 hours long?
1811000	1813000	That would be awesome.
1813000	1816000	They said it's going to be between two and two and a half hours long.
1816000	1823000	Well, yes, it will be 60 hours long, but then you can buy an expansion for just $39.95 that will expand it to 70 hours long.
1823000	1828000	Yeah, it was kind of funny because one of the people on the panel made a comment,
1828000	1830000	well, this first one will be blah, blah, blah.
1830000	1833000	And everybody was like, oh, my God, sequel.
1833000	1836000	Somebody, some stupid dumbass asked a question about a sequel.
1836000	1840000	They're like, okay, you guys, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
1840000	1844000	Let's make sure we knock this one out of the park first and then go on for sequel.
1844000	1848000	All right, we're going to have to have a whole sequel to the show to cover all the BlizzCon news.
1848000	1850000	We've got to get on to some other news.
1850000	1855000	RosteelUT in chat is pulling up a pillow and blanket because he just doesn't care about WoW.
1855000	1858000	We don't care about whoever that was that you just said.
1858000	1859000	I don't care about WoW either.
1859000	1861000	All right, are you doing okay over there, Loki?
1861000	1862000	I'm doing fine.
1862000	1863000	All right, well, let's get on to some other news.
1863000	1865000	Thank you guys very much for your respective con reports.
1865000	1867000	Actually, Mikotov, yours was kind of bad.
1867000	1868000	I didn't really care about your report.
1868000	1869000	Whatever, I didn't even really talk about it.
1869000	1870000	Yeah, you didn't really do anything.
1870000	1873000	Well, I could talk about it more, but I don't want to because it's true.
1873000	1877000	Tell us really, I don't know, maybe if they don't like World of Warcraft, they like Battlestar,
1877000	1880000	but please tell me about how you met the guy that played Tyrrell and what you did.
1880000	1885000	Okay, spoilers maybe, just so everybody knows.
1885000	1891000	The guy that plays Tyrrell, Aaron Douglas, was at Comic Con, and I went to go get his autograph.
1891000	1893000	I went up to him, and I was like,
1893000	1895000	can you write something mean about Callie?
1895000	1900000	Callie sucks, and Callie is his wife on the show, and I absolutely hate her.
1900000	1905000	He laughed at me, and then he started signing my thing I gave him to sign.
1905000	1909000	He put, to Shane, Aaron Douglas, chief.
1909000	1914000	I can't wait for Callie to die in season four, episode five, dot, dot, dot.
1914000	1918000	That was my favorite thing ever, and now I have something to look forward to.
1918000	1922000	I'd just like to point out that Shane called me long distance, like right after this happened,
1922000	1923000	just to tell me about this experience.
1923000	1924000	Because it's important.
1924000	1929000	It was like the coolest thing ever because I hate her a lot.
1929000	1934000	He's known to give away spoilers and stuff like that, so that could really be a real spoiler.
1934000	1938000	Well, there was one other convention going on that, unfortunately,
1938000	1943000	OLR did not have any representation at, but certainly there's a lot of news coming from QuakeCon,
1943000	1948000	and John Carmack at QuakeCon announced a brand new franchise for ID Software.
1948000	1950000	That would be Rage.
1950000	1952000	Rage is going to be like an action-adventure game,
1952000	1956000	and it's from a brand new engine that ID Software is doing called Tech Five.
1956000	1960000	It's going to be simultaneously launched on the PC, the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360,
1960000	1963000	and believe it or not, the Mac.
1963000	1967000	Yeah, originally when they were showing off the Tech Five demo, or Tech Five,
1967000	1972000	I guess it was a demonstration of it, they were actually showing off bits of Rage,
1972000	1974000	and it's kind of got a little bit of driving in there.
1974000	1977000	There's a bit of first-person shooter stuff in there as well,
1977000	1981000	so it's kind of like Motorstorm meets Quake.
1981000	1985000	In fact, here's a quote from Todd Hallensheet, the CEO of ID Software.
1985000	1987000	It's more than just a first-person shooter.
1987000	1990000	We will show vehicles and racetracks, driving and racing elements.
1990000	1993000	It is an action-oriented game, but with a lot of adventure elements.
1993000	1998000	It will be story-driven, but you can also choose your own route to go through things.
1998000	2000000	As long as it's better than Quake 4,
2000000	2002000	because Quake 4 held my interest for about three seconds,
2002000	2005000	and I was like, eh, not interested.
2005000	2008000	Yeah, well hopefully this will hold your interest for a little bit longer than that.
2008000	2011000	Quake Arena is headed to Xbox Live Arcade.
2011000	2015000	Now this is something we kind of knew a little bit of before
2015000	2017000	when the ESRB kind of leaked that out,
2017000	2021000	but apparently they had some really good success
2021000	2025000	with the Doom franchise on Xbox Live Arcade,
2025000	2027000	so now they're hoping to repeat that with Quake.
2027000	2032000	And I'm assuming it is going to be kind of like Unreal Tournament type of thing,
2032000	2035000	but with Quake, so awesome.
2035000	2037000	When I first read about this, though, I was thinking,
2037000	2043000	is this like the old-school version of Quake, but just adapted for Xbox Live?
2043000	2045000	It might be, I don't know.
2045000	2048000	Is that like the original Nine Inch Nails soundtrack and all that?
2048000	2049000	I don't think so.
2049000	2051000	Oh, I'll be sad.
2051000	2053000	I have fond memories of Quake.
2053000	2058000	This was back in the day when broadband you could only find in colleges, right?
2058000	2061000	Broadband was not really sold for commercial use,
2061000	2064000	and my friends went to college in the Bay Area,
2064000	2067000	and I used to call in dial-up to their broadband connection,
2067000	2069000	and we would play Quake.
2069000	2071000	About three of them in the dorms and then me on dial-up,
2071000	2074000	we'd stay up all night long playing Quake. It was awesome.
2074000	2076000	You couldn't do that with Duke Nukem Forever for some reason.
2076000	2077000	I don't know.
2077000	2079000	Because it never came out.
2079000	2082000	Perhaps this is another game people will stay up all night playing, though.
2082000	2085000	I don't know. It's a game called Quake Zero.
2085000	2089000	I'm going to take a wild guess and see that it's probably Quake 3 Arena
2089000	2091000	coming to Xbox Live Arcade since...
2091000	2092000	Actually, it's different.
2092000	2094000	Quake Zero is going to cost zero.
2094000	2096000	That's why it's called Quake Zero. It's free.
2096000	2099000	I understand that, but the port of Quake 3 Arena...
2099000	2102000	Oh, so the Quake Arena game...
2102000	2104000	Well, that would be awesome. Quake 3 is my favorite.
2104000	2105000	Well, there you go.
2105000	2106000	Oh, that would be great.
2106000	2110000	Well, anyway, Quake Zero is going to be a web-based version of Quake 3 multiplayer,
2110000	2113000	so you can just fire up your web browser and play.
2113000	2116000	Because, I don't know, has the source code been out for Quake 3?
2116000	2117000	I can't remember.
2117000	2120000	It doesn't matter because it's being developed in-house anyway, so they have it.
2120000	2122000	But they're going to be putting it out there,
2122000	2125000	and I guess it's going to be ad-supported.
2125000	2126000	It's going to have some in-game advertising.
2126000	2128000	That's how it's really going to be zero dollars.
2128000	2130000	But free is good.
2130000	2133000	Man, I would love to see Quake, and I'm playing it,
2133000	2135000	and then there's a McDonald's ad or something.
2135000	2139000	That would make it totally realistic.
2139000	2140000	Dark Tetsuya says,
2140000	2144000	LOL Quake Zero. Zero calories, zero sugar.
2144000	2146000	I guess, you know, from all that sitting...
2146000	2147000	More caffeine.
2147000	2149000	More caffeine, exactly.
2149000	2151000	Nintendo Maniac 64 said,
2151000	2156000	I wonder if Quake Zero will be anything like Phosphor when it runs on Shockwave.
2156000	2157000	RosteelUT says,
2157000	2159000	Yeah, ID released the source code ages ago.
2159000	2162000	I thought I remembered reading something about that.
2162000	2166000	Now if only Quake Zero were compatible with the Wii web browser.
2166000	2169000	Which I honestly doubt it would be.
2169000	2171000	But we can hope.
2171000	2173000	One thing that will be compatible though,
2173000	2175000	they announced Unreal Tournament 3,
2175000	2179000	which is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 later this year.
2179000	2182000	It's going to be supporting keyboard and mouse.
2182000	2185000	So that's kind of cool.
2185000	2188000	I know a lot of people really love keyboard and mouse,
2188000	2192000	especially playing PC first person shooters.
2192000	2194000	So now you can actually do that on the console
2194000	2197000	and kind of have a fair shake at people playing on PC.
2197000	2200000	Or as the people playing on PC.
2200000	2203000	That's kind of cool because that will put that whole debate to rest finally.
2203000	2204000	People can take it out.
2204000	2207000	What is better, the controller or the keyboard and mouse?
2207000	2209000	People can finally duke it out.
2209000	2214000	Unreal Tournament 3 for the PS3 is actually kind of shaping up more like a PC game.
2214000	2217000	I mean, obviously it is a PC game as well.
2217000	2220000	But with the fact that you can download mods for it.
2220000	2221000	That is pretty awesome.
2221000	2223000	I got to hand it to PlayStation 3 for that.
2223000	2226000	It's going to be sweet.
2226000	2228000	We will see.
2228000	2230000	Bravens Dolphin in chat says,
2230000	2233000	Bluetooth mouse and keyboard for the win.
2233000	2234000	Tiger Claw said,
2234000	2236000	Unreal Tournament 3 players with keyboard and mouse
2236000	2241000	will pwn the UT3 players with the 6 axis.
2241000	2244000	Well it's not like the keyboard and mouse are going to vibrate either.
2244000	2246000	So you got that.
2246000	2250000	Also some other news coming out of QuakeCon.
2250000	2253000	Is this coming out of QuakeCon or is this just about the same time?
2253000	2255000	It's about the same time.
2255000	2256000	It might be out of QuakeCon.
2256000	2257000	We will see here.
2257000	2260000	Actually this story is coming from Ain't It Cool News.
2260000	2261000	Which is kind of interesting.
2261000	2267000	Roger Avery is working on an adaptation of Castle Wolfenstein.
2267000	2268000	Fuck yeah.
2268000	2271000	Apparently it's actually returned to Castle Wolfenstein.
2271000	2274000	And apparently the producer of Silent Hill,
2274000	2277000	Samuel Hadida already has the rights to it.
2277000	2280000	And he gave the property over to Roger Avery to write and direct.
2280000	2283000	And if I'm not mistaken, Roger Avery did the script for Silent Hill, right?
2283000	2284000	I think so.
2284000	2285000	I think so.
2285000	2286000	Didn't he?
2286000	2288000	I don't know, but I know he's not doing it again.
2288000	2289000	I know he was tied to it.
2289000	2290000	Oh yeah, we talked about that a couple weeks ago.
2290000	2293000	Well I'm talking about it now, so continue your story.
2293000	2294000	We'll see.
2294000	2296000	According to Ain't It Cool News,
2296000	2302000	they expect we'll see World War 2 crazy tongue-in-cheek horror sci-fi action.
2302000	2308000	I wonder if you'll get Hitler in the big mech like you fought in the game.
2308000	2310000	That would be kind of strange.
2310000	2312000	It sounds horrific for Uwe Boll, though.
2312000	2313000	Oh.
2313000	2316000	I forgot to mention that earlier.
2316000	2318000	I interviewed Uwe Boll this week.
2318000	2319000	What the hell?
2319000	2320000	How did you not mention this to me?
2320000	2323000	People turned the show off ten minutes ago.
2323000	2324000	Sorry.
2324000	2325000	With all the loud talk.
2325000	2326000	I forgot.
2326000	2327000	You met Uwe Boll?
2327000	2328000	I didn't meet him.
2328000	2329000	I interviewed him over the phone, though.
2329000	2330000	Oh, okay.
2330000	2331000	But not for this show.
2331000	2332000	I interviewed him for my work.
2332000	2333000	What the hell?
2333000	2334000	Alright, well what happened?
2334000	2335000	Did you find anything else?
2335000	2336000	Okay, well here's the thing.
2336000	2339000	I had to watch his movie, BloodRayne 2 Deliverance,
2339000	2342000	and it's horrible, as you would expect,
2342000	2345000	but it was a vampire western,
2345000	2347000	and so we got to interview him about that,
2347000	2349000	and I asked him a few things.
2349000	2351000	A vampire western?
2351000	2353000	It's a vampire western, yes it is.
2353000	2354000	That could be cool, though.
2354000	2357000	It could be cool, but it's not.
2357000	2358000	No.
2358000	2361000	So, now obviously the interview was tame
2361000	2364000	because, you know, it was for a magazine,
2364000	2366000	so we had to be positive about the whole thing,
2366000	2368000	but we did ask him about the boxing stuff.
2368000	2370000	That was kind of funny.
2370000	2372000	I actually have the whole interview transcribed
2372000	2375000	on the Orange Lounge live journal community,
2375000	2377000	so if you want to check it out there,
2377000	2379000	you can see everything we talked about.
2379000	2383000	We also talked about there's a new movie he's doing
2383000	2385000	called Tunnel Rats that's being made into a game
2385000	2386000	at the same time,
2386000	2388000	so that's kind of an interesting thing,
2388000	2391000	and then of course Postal's coming out this year.
2391000	2395000	They had a lot of advertisement at Comic Con for Postal.
2395000	2396000	It was weird.
2396000	2399000	As crazy and bad as his movies are,
2399000	2402000	I really want to see Postal.
2402000	2404000	I think this is reverse psychology.
2404000	2406000	I think this is brilliant marketing
2406000	2408000	where somehow they're getting the word out there
2408000	2409000	that the movie is brilliant.
2409000	2411000	Like, there were preview screenings already, right?
2411000	2414000	Yeah, and people are saying it's pretty funny.
2414000	2416000	The whole thing is going to be offensive,
2416000	2417000	so that's all that matters.
2417000	2419000	So we got to talk to him.
2419000	2424000	He's a very interesting guy, but I don't know.
2424000	2427000	Okay, interesting is a very broad word
2427000	2430000	because you could know a guy that picks his nose
2430000	2431000	and eats it and you could go,
2431000	2432000	that's really interesting.
2432000	2434000	I kind of felt bad for him a little bit
2434000	2438000	because he's not trying to make awesome movies.
2438000	2440000	He's just trying to make genre flicks
2440000	2442000	and he just happens to use video games
2442000	2446000	to kind of supplement that to get more of an audience.
2446000	2447000	I don't know.
2447000	2449000	He's kind of an underachiever, I guess.
2449000	2451000	Who gets out of bed in the morning and goes,
2451000	2455000	I want to make a vampire westerner?
2455000	2457000	Film students?
2457000	2458000	I guess so.
2458000	2461000	I think we should make Orange Lawns Radio the movie
2461000	2463000	and it should be a vampire western.
2463000	2466000	Okay, the movie itself I knew was bad
2466000	2468000	like within the first two minutes.
2468000	2469000	I watched the whole movie and fast-forward
2469000	2471000	because I couldn't stand it.
2471000	2475000	Luckily though, I got to hear most of the dialogue
2475000	2477000	because it was really slow.
2477000	2479000	The only bad thing about it, there was no nudity.
2479000	2480000	That kind of sucked.
2480000	2483000	But, Zach Ward, the guy that plays the main character
2483000	2488000	in the Postal movie, he played Billy the Kid, the vampire.
2488000	2490000	I kind of liked him in that.
2490000	2492000	I thought he was a good vampire
2492000	2495000	and here's why he was a good vampire.
2495000	2499000	He would hurt innocent people without a thought.
2499000	2501000	For example, the very end of the movie,
2501000	2503000	she's going to rescue these kids
2503000	2505000	because he's going to bite them all and turn them
2505000	2509000	and make them more immortal or something.
2509000	2512000	She walks in and this trap springs
2512000	2516000	and basically all the kids get hung.
2516000	2517000	Awesome!
2517000	2521000	She's pushing this counterweight back
2521000	2523000	so the kids don't die, but unfortunately
2523000	2524000	one of the little kids dies.
2524000	2525000	That's so good.
2525000	2527000	There's stuff like that throughout the whole movie.
2527000	2529000	And they're not afraid to hurt innocent little children
2529000	2530000	in the movie.
2530000	2531000	I can respect that.
2531000	2532000	So, I don't know.
2532000	2533000	Wow.
2533000	2534000	Anyways.
2534000	2536000	Kill children, earn points for Loki.
2536000	2538000	Actually, I got to say real quick
2538000	2540000	is that Robert M. in our chatroom
2540000	2541000	at chatonorangelandradio.com
2541000	2543000	has the first piece of casting news
2543000	2547000	for Orange Lounge Radio, the new vampire western movie.
2547000	2549000	Loki has been cast to play Tingle.
2549000	2551000	Amazing.
2551000	2554000	There is no Tingle in this movie.
2554000	2556000	But where will we get our rupees?
2556000	2562000	Anyways, moving on to something completely opposite of that.
2562000	2565000	Lego Indiana Jones was announced at Comic Con
2565000	2568000	because there aren't enough Lego franchises yet
2568000	2571000	and they're going to milk that for every penny that they can.
2571000	2573000	Lego games aren't that bad.
2573000	2574000	They aren't that bad.
2574000	2575000	I can think of worse games.
2575000	2576000	I can think of far worse games.
2576000	2577000	They aren't that bad.
2577000	2579000	So, following Lego Batman this year
2579000	2581000	you're going to be seeing Lego Indiana Jones next year.
2581000	2583000	And I want Lego Batman, by the way.
2583000	2585000	That'll be pretty cool.
2585000	2588000	Well, it's a pity that Jamie isn't here
2588000	2591000	because she would probably be running circles around this story.
2591000	2593000	I'm very happy about this one.
2593000	2596000	Apparently, there is a Doctor Who video game
2596000	2598000	that could be on its way for Christmas.
2598000	2603000	Top Trumps has revealed a plan for a Doctor Who video game
2603000	2606000	to be released in time for Christmas 2007.
2606000	2610000	It's thought to be available on the PC, PlayStation 2, DS, and mobile games.
2610000	2612000	Apparently, an advertisement for the game appears
2612000	2614000	in the new Doctor Who Top Trumps card pack.
2614000	2617000	But now, I want to say that I saw a follow-up story to this
2617000	2619000	that said this actually may not be true.
2619000	2622000	That there was a retraction to this story that came out a little later.
2622000	2624000	So, it could be a little bit iffy, but
2624000	2626000	I mean, Doctor Who seems perfect for a video game.
2626000	2629000	I mean, I don't remember where I read this.
2629000	2632000	It was one of the blog sites, so I apologize for not giving you credit.
2632000	2635000	But, they put it brilliantly.
2635000	2638000	They said, this is good news and bad news.
2638000	2641000	The good news is it's a Doctor Who video game.
2641000	2644000	The bad news is it's a Doctor Who video game
2644000	2648000	because video games that are based off of TV shows and stuff
2648000	2650000	usually don't go too well.
2650000	2654000	That's true, but remember they announced that Battle Star game
2654000	2657000	for Xbox Live Arcade a while back?
2657000	2659000	It came out last week, I think.
2659000	2660000	Did it actually come out?
2660000	2662000	Oh, Battle Star. I'm sorry. I'm thinking Wing Commander.
2662000	2665000	Oh, no. Battle Star. I know it's on PartnerNet
2665000	2668000	and my friends that work at EA have been playing it
2668000	2670000	and they actually said it's a pretty fun game, even though
2670000	2677000	they're hardcore fans and it really is a typical space shooter
2677000	2679000	with Battle Star just plastered on it.
2679000	2682000	Nothing really Battle Star related beyond that.
2682000	2686000	So, you get occasional gems and I hope to goodness that
2686000	2689000	the Heroes game that Ubisoft is doing is going to be good.
2689000	2697000	There's no need to really worry about games that come from TV shows, I think.
2697000	2700000	I guess that's a little bit more encouraging there.
2700000	2706000	Well, there is another interesting rumor that's come out recently
2706000	2709000	and this is one that has me extremely excited.
2709000	2714000	Apparently, EGM has run their rumor mill story from Quarterman.
2714000	2716000	He does this every month.
2716000	2723000	And the rumor is that apparently they were, I believe, level 5.
2723000	2727000	They developed some RPGs and stuff.
2727000	2729000	Oh, actually, no. They weren't the ones that developed this. My mistake.
2729000	2732000	Anyways, Bionic Commando.
2732000	2735000	It was originally going to be made into a PlayStation Network game.
2735000	2741000	However, they decided that they're just going to make it into a full-fledged game instead.
2741000	2747000	So, possibly a Bionic Commando game soon.
2747000	2750000	That would be all kinds of rad because that's like an old series
2750000	2752000	that a lot of people would like to see get brought back.
2752000	2753000	Hell yeah.
2753000	2754000	I'd be very happy about that.
2754000	2759000	As long as they don't turn it into a completely different game.
2759000	2761000	You know what I mean?
2761000	2764000	Try to keep some of the elements that made the first one fun.
2764000	2766000	I would not want to see Bionic Commando go 3D.
2766000	2768000	That would not be fun for me.
2768000	2770000	But, I don't know.
2770000	2777000	If they did it like if it was as good as the Rygar game,
2777000	2781000	when they updated that, that wasn't too bad, I think.
2781000	2783000	But...
2783000	2786000	Dark Tetsuya in our chat room, chat.orangelandradar.com says,
2786000	2789000	Dear Capcom Wii version. K, thanks.
2789000	2791000	That could be interesting.
2791000	2794000	I don't know. We'll see.
2794000	2797000	Well, there's some games that you will no longer be playing
2797000	2802000	if you're a fan of EA online games because they're pulling the online support
2802000	2806000	for lots and lots of EA games as of September 1st, 2007.
2806000	2807000	Nothing very recent.
2807000	2811000	The majority of the list comes from all the sports games released in 2006,
2811000	2817000	such as Madden NFL 06, NASCAR 06, FIFA World Cup 06.
2817000	2819000	All those are shutting down.
2819000	2823000	And I guess the thought is that most of you will have upgraded to 08 by that point,
2823000	2824000	if not at least 07.
2824000	2827000	But I haven't upgraded from Madden 06.
2827000	2829000	Why do you own Madden 06?
2829000	2831000	Don't you mean you have an upgrade from Madden 99?
2831000	2833000	That is so not your kind of game, I thought.
2833000	2834000	It's not.
2834000	2835000	Is it achievement points?
2835000	2836000	No.
2836000	2837000	You're a whore.
2837000	2839000	You're a whore for achievement points.
2839000	2841000	Some other games have been getting shut down, though.
2841000	2846000	Surprisingly, November 1st of 07, Burnout Revenge on Xbox and Playstation 2.
2846000	2848000	So they're shutting off one of the Burnout titles
2848000	2851000	and the Need for Speed Underground and Most Wanted
2851000	2854000	also getting the plug pulled on them November 1st of 07.
2854000	2858000	Well, Underground's damn old and Revenge technically on,
2858000	2861000	well, the Xbox is the latest one.
2861000	2865000	But Playstation, I mean, they had Dominator, so...
2865000	2866000	Oh, well.
2866000	2870000	Well, if you're one of the five people that plays these games online still,
2870000	2872000	then you're probably pretty angsty.
2872000	2875000	So we dedicate the FUs of the Week just for you.
2875000	2877000	Now, usually we would have music here, but since we're in our temper...
2877000	2882000	Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun...
2882000	2884000	Hey, that's the music.
2884000	2885000	We can find music.
2885000	2886000	That's too late now.
2886000	2887000	We're live, remember?
2887000	2888000	Alright, so there we go.
2888000	2889000	There's your music.
2889000	2890000	And it's the FUs of the Week time.
2890000	2892000	So, Loki, start us off tonight.
2892000	2899000	My FU of the Week goes to Genki for just porting the Playstation 2 version
2899000	2902000	of Wangen Midnight to the Playstation 3.
2902000	2903000	I mean, come on.
2903000	2904000	Spend a little bit more time.
2904000	2909000	Hell, that fucking lame-ass game import tuner challenge that came out
2909000	2912000	on the Xbox 360 looked better than this.
2912000	2913000	That's sad.
2913000	2916000	And, you know, maybe some better music in it, too,
2916000	2920000	because that's kind of sad, too.
2920000	2922000	Yeah, music like that.
2922000	2926000	My next FU goes to Shane for not shutting his cell phone off
2926000	2927000	during the recording of the show.
2927000	2928000	I don't know what you're talking about.
2928000	2932000	My other FU goes to Comcast for making me suffer without internet
2932000	2936000	until Tuesday, and also to whichever mystery neighbor
2936000	2939000	I'm stealing Wi-Fi from for not being strong enough.
2939000	2941000	Although, I will give it this, like yesterday,
2941000	2945000	the strength of the Wi-Fi was perfect, and I was able to download
2945000	2949000	torrents of Big Brother to get all caught up on Big Brother 8.
2949000	2953000	So, and Jen sucks, just for the record.
2953000	2956000	Shane, do you have any FUs of the Wii?
2956000	2958000	I can come up with one real quick.
2958000	2963000	FU to Blizzard for not giving me the expansion for free,
2963000	2967000	or telling me when it's going to come out, because I really want it,
2967000	2970000	and it's really all I've been reading about since they announced it.
2970000	2973000	Like, me and the internet, that's all we do,
2973000	2977000	is just talk about the WoW expansion.
2977000	2980000	Alright, let's get back into some news.
2980000	2986000	Anyways, another cool game that's going to be heading our way pretty soon.
2986000	2990000	Crysis has been announced to be released on November 16th,
2990000	2995000	and that game looks damn good, and I really want to build a PC for it.
2995000	2998000	Tell us a little more about this game, I don't know much about it.
2998000	3002000	Crysis is the next game in the series of, I guess, Far Cry,
3002000	3003000	even though there is Far Cry 2.
3003000	3004000	Oh, that's right, I've heard of this.
3004000	3008000	But it's just, I mean, the original Far Cry game was pretty good looking.
3008000	3013000	This one now is just phenomenal, the amount of detail that's in the game,
3013000	3016000	just the amount of physics, I mean, you can blow up everything in the game,
3016000	3019000	you know, everything has real world looks good,
3019000	3024000	the draw distance is enormous, just, it's amazing.
3024000	3027000	So, it also is going to be a resource hog, I'm guessing.
3027000	3030000	Is it, like, in the future compared to Far Cry?
3030000	3032000	Because, I mean, I don't know much about Far Cry,
3032000	3035000	but, like, box art right there looks like it's crazy,
3035000	3037000	like, 2000 years in the future.
3037000	3039000	It's in the future, I'm assuming.
3039000	3043000	Basically, it's still on, like, a tropical island type thing.
3043000	3048000	Aliens have kind of either crash landed in one section of the map,
3048000	3053000	and so, you know, you have this whole section that's kind of 0G and, like, frozen.
3053000	3056000	So, it's interesting stuff there,
3056000	3059000	plus the whole suit that you have is, like, a nano suit that you can upgrade.
3059000	3063000	Like, you can switch it to, like, speed, so all your powers are in your speed,
3063000	3067000	and you can move around really fast, or armor, or stealth, and stuff like that.
3067000	3069000	So, really cool looking.
3069000	3070000	That could be interesting.
3070000	3075000	Well, this is also interesting, and that is SingStar is continuing
3075000	3077000	to do a lot of business and coming out with new games.
3077000	3079000	I guess this is mostly in Europe, though.
3079000	3081000	I have not heard of SingStar really taking off in this country.
3081000	3083000	There's another one coming out this month, actually.
3083000	3084000	My gosh.
3084000	3086000	SingStar amped in the US.
3086000	3088000	Maybe they are doing really well there,
3088000	3092000	and I think this is coming out in the US as well.
3092000	3095000	This is SingStar Anthems,
3095000	3097000	and it's actually, I got to hand it to them.
3097000	3099000	This is actually a pretty kick-ass song list.
3099000	3103000	If you like your power ballads and your anthems,
3103000	3105000	this is a pretty kick-ass song list.
3105000	3107000	Anastasia, Left Outside Alone.
3107000	3108000	I actually like that song.
3108000	3109000	Probably no one else has heard of it.
3109000	3110000	Avril Lavigne, I'm With You.
3110000	3113000	Cindy Lauper, Time After Time.
3113000	3117000	You DDR fans, the original version of Ordinary World by Duran Duran is in this.
3117000	3118000	Alone by Heart.
3118000	3120000	That's a hell of a power ballad.
3120000	3122000	Two songs by Mr. Mister.
3122000	3123000	That's awesome.
3123000	3124000	You get broken wings.
3124000	3127000	And Queen, The Show Must Go On,
3127000	3129000	Roxette, a couple Roxette songs in there.
3129000	3130000	What Roxette songs?
3130000	3131000	It must have been Love, of course.
3131000	3132000	But what's the other one?
3132000	3133000	Listen to Your Heart.
3133000	3134000	Oh.
3134000	3135000	I wanted Joyride.
3135000	3136000	I don't care.
3136000	3137000	That's not a power ballad.
3137000	3141000	And then the ultimate, the ultimate power ballad, Meat Loaf.
3141000	3143000	I'd Do Anything For Love, but I wouldn't do that.
3143000	3145000	That is all kinds of awesome.
3145000	3148000	I do agree with what Joystiq said when they reported on this.
3148000	3151000	And that would be, this game is shit without Journey.
3151000	3154000	How can you have a ballads game and have no Journey?
3154000	3155000	Where's my Don't Stop Believin'?
3155000	3157000	Is that on the Sony Open Arms?
3157000	3158000	Is it on the Sony label?
3158000	3160000	Because that's all they get are songs from the label.
3160000	3161000	Probably not then.
3161000	3162000	Surprise, Open Arms isn't on there.
3162000	3163000	I know.
3163000	3167000	How can you have, pay whatever it takes to get Open Arms in this game.
3167000	3169000	Or Don't Stop Believin'.
3169000	3171000	Sony can't afford to buy things right now.
3171000	3173000	They're all poor with the PS3 stuff.
3173000	3174000	Oh, whatever.
3174000	3177000	But if they want this game to take off, they will invest the money in it.
3177000	3180000	I'm curious to see what Chad says about this.
3182000	3185000	Oh, no, they're still commenting on Crysis.
3185000	3191000	RawsteelUT says, ooh Crysis, a generic first person shooter game with an extra graphical effort.
3191000	3193000	It's not that generic.
3193000	3195000	It looks pretty awesome.
3195000	3196000	Whatever.
3196000	3200000	Son of Dad says karaoke in the US only belongs in bars.
3200000	3202000	Yeah, but what if you have a bar at home?
3202000	3203000	Like you have a bunch of liquor at home.
3203000	3204000	That's acceptable, right?
3204000	3209000	You know, that's false because a lot of people I know love playing the karaoke games at parties and stuff.
3209000	3211000	It's really fun to do.
3211000	3213000	Robert M. suggests Foreigner, Poison.
3213000	3217000	Son of Dad also says he wants the final countdown.
3217000	3219000	Yes.
3219000	3221000	That would be awesome.
3221000	3226000	I just got 2DX 4th Style finally and I love that song so much.
3226000	3228000	Is that part of the economy liquidation sale?
3228000	3229000	Yes.
3229000	3231000	Brand new 2DX 4th Style.
3231000	3233000	The 5 figure sale economy.
3233000	3234000	Whatever.
3234000	3237000	It was free.
3237000	3239000	You know, I found something the other day actually.
3239000	3240000	What?
3240000	3241000	I found it today.
3241000	3244000	I have a DDR club append.
3244000	3246000	I don't even know where the hell that came from.
3246000	3247000	How random.
3247000	3248000	It might be mine.
3248000	3250000	I used to have both those games.
3250000	3251000	Maybe.
3251000	3253000	You probably have it from when we used to live together years ago.
3253000	3255000	No, I think Jamie gave it to me.
3255000	3257000	She gave you a club append?
3257000	3258000	I think those things are actually worth kind of money.
3258000	3260000	No, I doubt it.
3260000	3262000	Those are the DDR games nobody fucking played.
3262000	3263000	Who played club append?
3263000	3264000	I did.
3264000	3269000	I didn't play it anyways because I don't have second mix so it's completely useless to me.
3269000	3271000	It did have a lot of crap on it though.
3271000	3273000	Let's talk about release dates, shall we?
3273000	3276000	And we'll travel to Europe first even though Jamie's not here tonight.
3276000	3279000	I've got her back and it's really not a long list this week.
3279000	3285000	On August 10th over in Europe you guys are getting Pac-Man Rally on the PSP.
3285000	3286000	Congratulations.
3286000	3287000	That's really it.
3287000	3289000	That's everything that's on the list that we've got.
3289000	3291000	They get a crappy game for a crappy system.
3291000	3292000	Wow.
3292000	3293000	Good job.
3293000	3295000	You want to wait for some busier weeks.
3295000	3299000	Get to the 31st when you guys are getting Boogie and Guild Wars, Eyes of the North,
3299000	3300000	and Medal of Honor.
3300000	3303000	Or the 24th when you guys are getting mad at NFL.
3303000	3305000	And the game named after Loki.
3305000	3308000	You're ruining all the future release dates.
3308000	3309000	Sorry.
3309000	3310000	Jamie's going to be so angry.
3310000	3312000	I feel bad because there's only one freaking release this week.
3312000	3314000	So I'm trying to give him something to look forward to.
3314000	3318000	I don't think Europe is filled with Pac-Man Rally fans.
3318000	3319000	I mean, if I'm wrong.
3319000	3320000	It was.
3320000	3321000	It's a huge release for them.
3321000	3324000	If I'm wrong, Europe folks, please send us an email.
3324000	3328000	Mailbag at orangeontree.com and please tell us how much you love Pac-Man Rally and how
3328000	3329000	you're going to be camping outside.
3329000	3331000	Send us your pictures from camping outside games.
3331000	3333000	I want to go camp for Pac-Man Rally.
3333000	3334000	You want to hear something?
3334000	3335000	I'm lining up.
3335000	3338000	You want to hear something about the stupid rally games that they have in Europe?
3338000	3344000	We keep getting fucking some, was it SVG or something, one of these smaller distributors
3344000	3348000	out there keeps publishing this European crap that comes over here.
3348000	3354000	For example, they have Crazy Frog Racer because ooh, we really need a game based off that
3354000	3356000	annoying piece of shit.
3356000	3360000	Then there's this Cocoto Racer thing which is like some little devil looking thing.
3360000	3361000	I don't know.
3361000	3364000	Too many kart racing games in Europe.
3364000	3370000	However, though, in the U.S. there's not a whole lot coming out of this week, but there
3370000	3372000	is a lot more than in the U.K.
3372000	3378000	For example, on PSP we've got Crazy Taxi Fair War, also Tomb Raider Anniversary, that's
3378000	3379000	going to be coming out.
3379000	3388000	On the DS you've got Mega Man, Star Force Pegasus, and Star Force Leo, and if you're
3388000	3392000	buying through GameStop, Star Force Dragon.
3392000	3398000	Also, we've got Glory Days 2, which is supposed to be a pretty good kind of a side scroller
3398000	3400000	or strategy game.
3400000	3403000	On the Wii, Boogie is going to be coming out.
3403000	3410000	It's kind of a scene in karaoke game, or dancing in karaoke game.
3410000	3416000	PlayStation 3, nothing, although I do believe that Splinter Cell Double Agent I thought
3416000	3417000	was coming out this week.
3417000	3418000	I don't know.
3418000	3427000	And then on PC, aww, no Tycoon game this week.
3427000	3428000	That's a first.
3428000	3429000	Damn.
3429000	3431000	You know, I was really hoping.
3431000	3434000	Pac-Man Rally Tycoon is coming out on the PC, go figure.
3434000	3438000	No, there's Attack on Pearl Harbor, so that's kind of cool.
3438000	3441000	And, I don't know.
3441000	3443000	Star Defender 3, woohoo.
3443000	3447000	Alright, well coming out in Japan, Japan's also kind of having a bit of a slow week when
3447000	3450000	it comes to game releases, but they do have one big one that a lot of folks are looking
3450000	3451000	forward to.
3451000	3456000	On the PlayStation 2, Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System is coming out this week.
3456000	3458000	The dumbest name for a game.
3458000	3460000	It's basically the International Zodiac Job System.
3460000	3462000	It's the international version.
3462000	3466000	Yeah, the international version that doesn't go anywhere but Japan.
3466000	3469000	It doesn't get released anywhere else.
3469000	3471000	I know, but there will be people importing it.
3471000	3475000	There are, I believe it's just the voiceovers, you can select English options.
3475000	3476000	I don't think the text is English.
3476000	3480000	Oh, because that would be awesome if it was in English because then you could import it.
3480000	3484000	Well, most of the other international versions is what people did.
3484000	3488000	Like Kingdom Hearts II Final Men just for chains of memories on PS2.
3488000	3490000	But the text wasn't English, I thought.
3490000	3491000	I thought it was just the voices.
3491000	3496000	I'm not sure, to be honest, because I already have Final Fantasy XII and I could care less
3496000	3497000	about new systems.
3497000	3500000	But you get to do new International Zodiac Jobs.
3500000	3501000	Yippee.
3501000	3502000	Whatever that means.
3502000	3508000	I think it meant that you're supposed to cater your characters to more like one classic class.
3508000	3511000	Like one of them is more like a red mage and the other one is more like a black mage.
3511000	3516000	They had new classes too or something, funny languages because it wasn't English.
3516000	3521000	Also coming out, which we should note, on the DS, the DS has a little bit more releases.
3521000	3523000	Of course, there's another Yu-Gi-Oh! game coming out, Yu-Gi-Oh!
3523000	3525000	Dual Monsters GX.
3525000	3531000	And also coming out, we should say, on Nintendo's DS from Nintendo,
3531000	3537000	Donkey Kong Jungle Climber or the King of Swing is coming out in Japan as well.
3537000	3539000	King of Swing 2, basically.
3539000	3544000	And Looking at SP.
3544000	3548000	Hey, there's a Professional Atlas Travel Guide.
3548000	3550000	That would be the most fun game ever.
3550000	3552000	I want to look up where Rome is at.
3552000	3554000	Wild Arms XF or Wild Arms Crossfire.
3554000	3555000	You can also look forward to that.
3555000	3557000	It's not as cool as Dust Cap 2.
3557000	3558000	I know.
3558000	3559000	Not as cool as Dust Cap 2.
3559000	3560000	Definitely.
3560000	3561000	Well, that's it.
3561000	3563000	That's all the release dates I'm going to care to name this week.
3563000	3567000	Well, one upcoming release that we're going to get some more information about at Tokyo
3567000	3574000	Game Show this year is Metal Gear Solid 4, where it's rumored that the game will actually
3574000	3577000	have a release date announced.
3577000	3580000	Although, we're probably guessing March right now.
3580000	3586000	So, we just had a story about naming a date where they're going to name a release date.
3586000	3587000	Damn it!
3587000	3589000	I did it again!
3589000	3593000	I thought we said no more of these stories about naming a date where they're going to
3593000	3594000	have a date.
3594000	3595000	This is so stupid.
3595000	3598000	I'm sorry, why do people get excited about this?
3598000	3600000	No, it's okay.
3600000	3601000	Fired!
3601000	3602000	No, we can't fire Loki.
3602000	3604000	Or else, where else would we record this week?
3604000	3605000	We'd be screwed.
3605000	3606000	Yeah.
3606000	3607000	Alright.
3607000	3609000	Some other things to note really quickly.
3609000	3611000	Some releases coming out in Europe.
3611000	3617000	Super Paper Mario is finally coming out in Europe on September 14th, speaking of dates.
3617000	3618000	Can you believe it?
3618000	3623000	It's coming out for 35 pounds in Europe.
3623000	3629000	Wow, that's probably how much weight you gained waiting for this game to come out, I guess.
3629000	3630000	I don't know.
3630000	3632000	Why would you just be sitting there or something?
3632000	3633000	Wouldn't you be active?
3633000	3635000	You're camped outside the store, remember?
3635000	3640000	Not for Paper Mario, for Pac-Man Rally thing or whatever it was called.
3640000	3646000	While you're enjoying Pac-Man Rally, wait for Paper Mario.
3646000	3647000	I guess, okay.
3647000	3649000	I guess you can get 35 pounds that way.
3649000	3655000	Now, what is much more important that is on the Nintendo DS on September 14th over in
3655000	3661000	Europe is freshly picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland is finally coming out.
3661000	3663000	Loki, will you be importing it?
3663000	3665000	Because the great news is the DS is region-free.
3665000	3669000	Even though there's no plans to release this game in the US yet, you can actually import
3669000	3673000	this game still for probably about, I think I saw it listed somewhere for about 45 bucks
3673000	3674000	if you want to get Tingle.
3674000	3676000	A waste of 45 dollars.
3676000	3677000	Why not?
3677000	3678000	Why won't you buy this game, Matt?
3678000	3679000	Why the hate for Tingle?
3679000	3680000	Because I don't like Tingle.
3680000	3682000	I think Tingle's a stupid character.
3682000	3684000	I didn't like him in Wind Waker.
3684000	3687000	Why the hell would I like him now?
3687000	3689000	Now that he has his own game?
3689000	3691000	I wonder if the game is any good.
3691000	3692000	I haven't heard anything about it.
3692000	3695000	I don't bet he's going to be in fucking Smash Brothers Brawl.
3695000	3696000	As a playable character?
3696000	3699000	And then I'll never hear the fucking end of it.
3699000	3702000	Tingle's in fucking Smash Brothers.
3702000	3703000	Check it out.
3703000	3704000	I don't think he'll be in it.
3704000	3706000	I don't remember how that got started, associating Loki with Tingle.
3706000	3709000	It's because I did his voice once.
3709000	3713000	And ever since then, it's just never-ending.
3713000	3717000	It would be really weird to have him in it, though, because they're using all the Zelda
3717000	3718000	things.
3718000	3719000	Oh!
3719000	3720000	Do Tingle's voice.
3720000	3721000	That'd be awesome.
3721000	3723000	They're using the Zelda things from Twilight Princess, and even though I didn't beat the
3723000	3725000	game, I never saw Tingle there.
3725000	3730000	Yeah, but he was in Wind Waker, and I think he was in one of the Nintendo 64 ones.
3730000	3732000	He was in a crappy one, Majora's Mask.
3732000	3736000	But they've already covered Wind Waker and all that stuff, I thought, in the last game.
3736000	3742000	But if they're giving him his own game, they also fucking took Balloon Fight, and made
3742000	3743000	his own version of that.
3743000	3744000	Come on.
3744000	3746000	I'm just not-
3746000	3748000	It's quirky and weird in Japanese.
3748000	3750000	I hate the Japanese.
3750000	3755000	GS68 is in chat and says, Tingle, as the Super Smash Brothers Brawl character, will Loki
3755000	3759000	get shot?
3759000	3764000	Wonder Dog Harold has a suggestion, Loki should just say he likes Tingle, and then no one
3764000	3766000	would bring up Tingle ever again.
3766000	3769000	I don't like Tingle, though, that's the thing.
3769000	3771000	I think he's a stupid character.
3771000	3773000	All right, it's done.
3773000	3775000	We're beating a dead horse here, seriously.
3775000	3778000	Okay, let's go on and go to break.
3778000	3782000	We're gonna go to break, and when we come back from break, we're gonna get into some
3782000	3785000	more information on Part B, including some news about the Xbox 360.
3785000	3786000	Sounds pretty exciting.
3786000	3790000	Yeah, the ultra-secret announcement for next week, or this week, I should say.
3790000	3795000	Okay, we'll get into that very soon, as well as talking about some game delays, that's
3795000	3796000	always fun.
3796000	3798000	And Shane is gonna read tonight's mailbag.
3798000	3799000	Totally.
3799000	3801000	That should be interesting, to say the least.
3801000	3803000	Watch out, because I might make fun of you.
3803000	3819000	All right, so we'll be back in just a moment with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
