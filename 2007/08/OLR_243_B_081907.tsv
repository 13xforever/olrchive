15456	19138	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19679	29264	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August 19th, 2007, for part B of episode number 243 of our podcast.
29304	30505	Yes, we've been doing this a little while.
31466	36089	Of course, on our show, if you're brand new to our program, we like to discuss the latest in video games and gaming culture.
36169	40011	And, you know, we're three gamers that all met playing DDR at an arcade and
40967	44828	We've known each other for about five years doing this program and just kind of like to give our share.
44848	46629	And of course, it's all about what you guys have to say as well.
46649	53131	And you can always interact with our program through the chat room or through our Skype line or our voicemail or mailbag.
53171	60914	You can always send us emails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com because if we can do a show, if any old idiots like us can do a show, then you guys should be able to be a part of it as well.
61414	63015	So anyhow, let's get back into the gaming news.
63095	66156	Started off with some talk about Mario Kart coming out on the Wii.
66196	69337	There's some brand new details about Mario Kart on the Wii.
70155	91007	apparently a couple of screenshots, new screenshots actually hit the internet this week and so it gives some more details about what's going on of course the tracks appear to be bigger and better as you would expect on a new console you can do jumps, little jumps again, the jump button is back 12 player racing online, shortcuts within the tracks as well mid-air stunts apparently can be done in the game as well
91445	98994	and tracks being carried over from Mario Kart Double Dash, which is cool because some of the classic tracks, of course, have awesome design in them.
99394	106443	So I'd like to see the old school Rainbow Road come back one more time because I wasn't as big of a fan of the new school Rainbow Roads as the old one.
106603	109166	Mario Kart 64, I think, was probably one of the best.
110682	111622	I love Mario Kart 64.
111783	115064	That's one of the few Nintendo 64 games I really, really adore.
115104	118725	Which, by the way, I forgot to say in Part A during my gaming week, I played F-Zero 64.
119205	120806	I didn't care for it.
121166	122607	I know, Jamie, you said you loved that one.
122987	123727	I didn't really care for it.
123827	132710	I do see, though, now where a lot of GX, the GameCube one, came from, because it totally feels like an earlier version of F-Zero GX.
132970	140133	I thought Mario Kart 64 was a way better racer on the Nintendo 64 than F-Zero, sadly.
141138	142642	Which makes me sad, because I love my F-Zero.
142983	144106	But, oh well.
144488	144708	Anyhow.
146027	150289	Anyways, some interesting news in the homebrew scene on the Wii.
150789	158933	Apparently, if you have a mod-chipped Wii, they have just enabled it to be able to play DVDs, as if you really need to do that.
159153	169537	But, in case you're interested, what you can do is actually using a, I guess, clone CD, like some special boot CD that you create.
169737	172699	You'll boot it with your Wii that's got...
173719	181462	I guess it's a mod that's programmed in Wyo Assembly 1.8, and I guess they use this program called Wii Boss.
182542	186643	And then what you do is you just mount the disc and pop in the DVD.
187784	193145	So you get to play it using the Wii Remote, of course, as the remote for it.
193165	195606	I don't know, it's kind of gimmicky, kind of cool.
195966	201968	Hopefully something that they can implement later on, since it looks like the Wii is fully capable, of course, playing DVD movies.
203437	207858	There has to be some sort of functionality already built in that they're going to release something for later.
208918	210859	Seems so weird how Nintendo does that.
210899	213419	They love to do these time release things on their consoles.
213779	215740	Like, you know, DS, surprise, it goes online.
215780	216960	Surprise, it has voice chat.
216980	217300	Surprise.
217580	218541	It's just interesting.
219141	220861	Nintendo has some very interesting strategies sometimes.
221801	226242	Well, I think that as a company, they're very far-seeing.
226282	226823	You know what I mean?
227223	228583	They look at the big picture, the...
229474	232996	They have a vision and stick to it.
233016	237118	There was speculation on this article by Gizmodo.
237638	238539	They were saying that
239275	262131	Possibly later on, since the whole issue was DVD licensing fees, I guess the license, the technology to play back DVD video, obviously they didn't want to increase the cost of the Wii, so what you could possibly do later on is get a DVD channel for your Wii downloaded off of WiiWare, and then you pay the money for the licensing fee up front, there you go, pop that in and you can play DVDs.
262691	266133	Well, AZHP brings up an interesting point in our chat room.
266533	271835	There can't be anything already in the Wii that can play DVDs because they need to buy the licensing to include that software.
272255	275817	It's not legal for them to add in DVD compatibility and time release it.
276777	277217	Interesting.
278878	283460	Son of Dad said the Dreamcast was going to have DVD playback, but it never happened.
284641	289863	I still don't think that there's any problem because really the DVD, the audio and video...
290837	302186	Really, that's just a particular file, and if the Wii is already set up to read those types of files, then having specific DVD playability in the Wii is not the issue.
302386	303928	It was not made with that intent.
304068	306590	It would just be able to read those files already.
308871	310132	It needs the software, I think.
310313	316678	Ross Deal UT says, what a thinly veiled attempt to justify pirate mod chips, since, hey, it plays DVDs.
316918	318239	Oh, and by the way, you can play copied games.
320100	320620	Interesting thought.
320780	337490	Nintendo's always, well, this whole thing that surprised me about modding the Wii and about their import policy with it is that they never, I guess, really cared that much in the past, given that in every other system except the GameCube, it was all physical lockout.
338611	342933	At least with the TurboGrafx, it was a difference in the pin sets on the HuCards.
344514	346775	And there was no real good converter.
346896	348737	I have the one that was supposed to be the best.
348937	349437	It doesn't work.
350439	354701	So, except for the CD games, there was no country coding, but there were still new CD games.
355261	363525	But, I don't see exactly why they're as all up in arms on this when, you know, Sony's like, hey, you can play them, here.
366106	366686	Well, you know.
367696	374419	It's kind of an old debate at this point for me, but, you know, I think everything should be region-free.
374480	383864	I don't understand the intent to region-lock things, especially, I mean, I can understand because of the DVD licensing, you have to region-lock things, but with the Wii, if you don't have DVD playback, you don't need to region-lock things.
383884	386645	I don't think you have to region-lock everything with DVDs and stuff.
386705	388126	I mean, look at the... Unless it's porn.
388366	393929	I mean, the PlayStation 3, granted, it's Blu-ray, but, you know, that's region-free.
394029	395229	The PSP's region-free.
395269	396410	DS is region-free.
397008	398329	Game Boy Advance region free.
398569	401230	I mean, I don't see what the point is.
401370	408634	If anything, you're going to be selling more copies of games because people are going to buy, like, say, Owen Dunn and then buy Elite Beat Agents.
409235	410956	Hey, you sold an extra copy in Japan.
411276	413477	Who cares if they paid money to have it shipped over here?
413517	414137	That's their money.
414197	416999	I mean, but you sold an extra copy because of that.
417319	418480	Is that really a bad thing?
419000	421381	And then we're going to get a Ninja Pass, but that's another story.
422222	424423	Jaded says, Nintendo is a toy company.
424463	426284	They produce toys, not DVD players.
427769	456742	GS68 says because if you buy the Japanese version of a game that has a North American version it could cause problems with your region's market interesting alright well if you want to chat with us join our chatroom chat.orangeloungeradio.com and give us your two cents well for anybody who is still keeping up with anything about the virtual console in the way I do have the update for the UK
458025	463048	As you were saying previously, Wave Race 64 is out for 1,000 points.
463788	467070	It translated to 7 pounds, 10 euro.
468411	470692	And, well, it's Wave Race, which I didn't really care for.
472593	474674	You also have Crater Maze from the TurboGrafx-16.
474694	476495	600 Wii points, 420 pounds, 6 euro.
476515	477776	And I think that's it.
484082	484642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
501144	504485	and some weird games coming out for the PlayStation 2 very soon.
505265	511567	A brand new accessory is coming out for the PlayStation 2 and Into Games is supposed to be revealing this at the Games Convention in Leipzig.
512427	514927	It's a Wiimote, basically, for the PlayStation 2.
514967	515868	I probably shouldn't call it that.
515888	518768	It's a motion-sensing pad for the PlayStation 2.
519569	525130	The games that are going to be coming out for it, Real Play Tennis, Real Play Pool, Real Play Golf...
525570	529211	RealPlay Racing, RealPlay Bowling, and RealPlay Puzzle Spear.
529251	530911	Hmm, I've heard of some of these games before.
531571	538713	The little sensing pad is supposed to emulate tennis rackets, pool cues, golf clubs, and steering wheels, amongst others.
539353	539673	Hmm.
541193	543254	I heard a voice of disagreement over there, Loki.
543274	543794	What do you think?
544554	545334	It's gimmicky shit.
545354	545934	That's what it is.
547335	550955	I've seen the pictures of them, and it's not what you think.
551055	553456	It's not a game pad, per se.
553536	554556	It's not like the Wii Remote.
555009	556590	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
580236	588041	Well, on the other hand, I can't help but feel like I've played these games before, and when games start feeling unoriginal, I don't know about you guys, but I get a little bit angsty.
588061	589302	Do you guys get a little bit angsty?
590103	590523	All the time.
590543	593905	Well, that means it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.
595747	605933	Jamie, why don't you start us off?
606554	606674	Um...
609017	612661	F you to headaches that develop into nosebleeds.
615945	616466	That's no fun.
616926	617367	No, it's not.
617427	618888	Is that it?
620130	623293	And also an F you to nosebleeds while I'm busy drinking.
623313	624214	Loki.
624334	624655	Loki.
625587	631449	Um, F you to pompous little jerks that think they can drive their truck around like it's a fucking race car.
632329	636010	Um, actually this was funny, we saw this last night while we were at the movie theater.
636030	641412	This dumbass blowing through tons of stop signs in the parking lot, driving like 50 miles an hour.
642673	646414	And you know, usually it's like, where the fuck are the cops when you need them?
646914	649215	There just happened to be a cop right when you needed him.
649375	651796	Pulled the bastard over, it was awesome.
652116	653156	I laughed my ass off.
654383	654803	Good times.
654883	655864	Justice is served.
657605	662267	My FU goes to this weird cavity thing I have in my mouth.
662307	671472	It's not like a tooth cavity, but I think like one of my crowns is coming off or something, and now there's like a cavity, and it sucks because it hurts, and now I have to go to the dentist, and I hate going to the dentist.
671892	674814	Because I... Oh, God, the dentist makes you feel so stupid.
674854	676534	I don't know about you guys, but I hate my dentist.
677035	678315	So I've hated every single one.
678355	680677	I think there's only been like one dentist I've ever gone to I ever liked.
680697	681477	You should go to my dentist.
681517	682177	He's very great.
682337	683438	He probably doesn't take my insurance.
683945	686907	F you to my dentist insurance, not letting me go to very many dentists.
686947	687787	I always fall asleep.
688848	689208	Let's see.
690148	691469	Just F you to the dentist in general.
691629	692490	Not my favorite thing to do.
694431	694751	Wah.
695491	697372	Okay, just kind of following up with the story here.
697412	699954	I know this is really bad radio, but this is what they are.
700894	704196	Those are the controllers for the real thing.
704276	707698	Oh, God, those look like those crappy attachments that they came out with for the Wii.
707738	709539	That's the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
709559	710199	Except they're not.
710239	713381	They just have little sensors and shit on them, so...
714622	725291	Yeah, it's not a whole lot to get excited about, but hey, I mean, if you're into that kind of stuff and you don't want to go out and buy an actual Wii system and you want to be able to bowl at home and stuff, great, buy the game.
725331	726932	It's only like 30 bucks anyway, so.
727433	734999	So it's not really a Wiimote coming to the PlayStation 2, but it's these, you know, Wii-like technologies coming to the PlayStation 2.
735400	736500	Something like that, yeah.
736701	736941	Alright.
736961	738122	I don't know.
739410	756423	Now, what's also interesting, this kind of leaked out during an online demo for, I believe it was for another game, during Unreal Tournament 3, they had accidentally paused the game or something, and a gamer card screen popped up that's going to be tied in with home.
756924	765171	And apparently, you know, the PlayStation Network will be getting a similar type of thing with their home service, and...
766149	772930	My guess is going to be very similar to what Xbox has right now with their live service.
772950	784952	What's interesting, though, is Gamer Card might sound familiar, seeing as there's that whole My Gamer Card thing as part of Xbox.
785212	787973	I don't know.
788213	788453	Great.
790173	793734	Well, I mean, if it's not broken, why fix it?
793774	795594	It's not the most original idea, but...
796548	798229	It's good that they're getting something else, I guess.
799149	801411	Joshi16 says, Sony innovating again.
801791	802271	Brilliant.
803072	803792	Innovation.
804132	805153	Yeah, that's the key word.
805373	805573	All right.
805593	808975	Well, if you guys want to comment on this, we're actually going to open our Skype line a little bit early tonight.
808995	812897	If you weren't listening to Part A, unfortunately, the live stream is getting shut off at 8 p.m.
812957	814498	or so we're being told for some maintenance.
814898	823703	So to make sure that our live listeners get a chance to interact with us tonight before the plug is pulled on the live stream and we have to finish the show with no live interaction, we want to open up our Skype line.
823743	824203	So please...
824865	826446	Head on over and give us a call.
826466	829066	1-866-GAME-OLR.
829847	831907	Sorry, is it 1-866 or 1-877?
832047	831907	877.
833388	835189	God damn it.
835209	836149	1-877-GAME-OLR.
836249	837009	Get it right, Rob.
837029	840290	I think I know it after this amount of time.
840310	841371	1-877-GAME-OLR.
841571	847212	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
847232	848173	1-877-GAME-OLR.
848293	851774	So just waiting for a call to come in and we'll take it.
853203	853763	Bioshock Bioshock
878351	884775	Yeah, but I want to ask you that the minigame, the hacking minigame, are you good at that game?
886656	888858	Rob, you said you didn't do it, didn't you?
888878	891359	I wasn't able to complete it, but I only tried it one time.
891439	891940	It reminded me.
891960	893461	It's Pipe Dream.
893541	894622	That's what it was, Pipe Dream.
894982	898344	Or that game on PopCap Games with the little Chinese fireworks.
898404	900485	I don't remember the name of that game, but it reminded me of both those games.
900505	901526	And yeah, it's real easy.
901586	903067	Here's my trick in the whole thing.
903347	905969	You just flip over all the tiles if you can.
906269	907290	That's my trick.
907510	907670	Yeah.
908018	908418	Connect them.
908759	911801	Is there, like, why wouldn't you want to flip over all the tiles?
911861	913463	Is there, like, a downside to flipping them over?
913483	914103	You pay money.
914123	914784	Not that I found out.
914804	915304	You pay money?
916265	918427	Yeah, you know, it's either hack it or pay money.
919328	919448	Oh.
919688	920409	Oh, well, no.
920829	922591	When you're flipping over the tiles, you don't pay money.
922711	923532	It's just... No, no, no.
924032	926394	If you lose, then your health goes bad.
927015	931138	You can pay money to just have it automatically hack, or you can do the tile thing.
931158	933440	But, yeah, I don't understand why you wouldn't flip over all the tiles.
934561	935142	Yeah, just some...
935838	938099	Some people I talk to go like, the game's hard.
938159	939039	This is really hard.
939720	942100	You're supposed to flip over every tile and try to figure out shit.
943861	946862	That seems to kind of defeat the purpose if you just go in there and flip over every tile.
946922	950604	There are some other tiles that are in the actual game.
950724	953945	I'm not sure if there's a downside to flipping over tiles.
954265	958266	Maybe that's one of the differences where the demo and the real game are a little different.
958607	960367	I'll have to ask someone I know that already owns the game.
960727	962468	What did you want to say about the hacking, RavensDolphin?
963243	968144	Well, you know, yesterday I showed how I can be very good at the hacking.
968304	970665	I showed everyone that I can get it done quite quickly.
971185	972425	And they went like, oh, it's very hard.
972465	973305	I went like, it's not hard.
973565	975245	And I showed them that it's not hard.
975265	977246	And what did they do?
977266	979726	Were they calling you names because you just flipped over every tile?
979746	980647	That was your trick, or what?
981247	983767	No, they just went like, I can never get through the hacking.
984407	986928	Like the little mini-game, I'm like, I'm going to show you how to get through it.
987108	990829	Well, I believe in the full version of the game you're supposed to be able to hack the vending machines.
990849	991969	There's other stuff you can hack, too.
993084	994505	There's other things that hack in the game.
994565	995506	Can't wait for it though.
995786	997147	Yeah, are you excited about Bioshock?
997908	1001611	Yeah, but the thing about, there's an interesting story about this game for me.
1001971	1004553	I can't remember pre-ordering it at all.
1004573	1008356	EB says I have a pre-order for it, so someone must like me.
1009056	1011178	You think somebody went in there and put a pre-order down for you?
1012319	1012819	I don't know.
1013079	1016722	I just can't remember for the life of me why I have a pre-order for it.
1017703	1019184	Alright, well one more thing Raven's Dolphin.
1020356	1021657	Yeah, there was one more thing.
1022178	1024120	This is about Bioshock.
1024180	1029084	When you first saw Rapture, was your jaw on the floor like, that can't be right?
1030045	1033108	Like when you first go down into the city?
1033148	1033488	Yeah.
1035253	1037013	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
1064000	1075507	and 2K to some extent did this with their last game, Prey, which I actually talked about on this program a lot and it was actually a first person shooter I really liked was Prey because it was set up for dummies like me who could never die in Prey.
1075567	1076047	I loved it.
1077228	1081291	For the hardcore FPS fan, they hated it, but it was also set up very much like a movie.
1081891	1085793	But I don't know, Bioshock pulls it off in a different way that's much more engrossing than even Prey.
1086854	1087394	One last thing.
1087674	1088055	Of course.
1088075	1088975	Next gen flushing.
1089055	1091797	I enjoyed flushing the toilet and see it actually going down.
1092924	1093886	Which way did it spin?
1095068	1095809	Which way did it flash?
1098552	1100913	That's a good question, because it is the bottom of the ocean.
1101253	1103593	Because this city is supposed to exist at the bottom of the ocean.
1103613	1105434	So the question is, does it spin a different way?
1105454	1106834	What part of the world was it in?
1106854	1107474	I don't remember.
1107574	1112155	I said that now we have next-gen flushing, and this is next generation.
1112575	1113335	Flushing and water.
1113495	1116076	You could flush the toilet in Duke Nukem 3D.
1116236	1118577	You could flush the toilets in Final Fantasy VI.
1118957	1120117	But not like this.
1120317	1122157	You can't just go up to it and just flush it.
1122737	1125138	If you go in the bathroom in the palace...
1125845	1127946	You can kneel on the toilet.
1128846	1129587	I guess that's the problem.
1129607	1131348	And you move off of it and it flushes.
1132008	1132328	Really?
1132528	1134009	So do all the boys sit when they pee?
1135009	1136630	It's everybody kneels on the toilet.
1137610	1140492	But you can also flush them in Animal Crossing, too, if you sit on them like a chair.
1140512	1141472	You guys are very bored.
1142293	1151737	I have to say, that certainly lets you know that the creators of the game have gotten it down to every last freaking detail when the toilet flushes and everything.
1152225	1157630	The fact that you can run around and eat all the food and smoke all the cigarettes, and apparently you can also play the guitars in the game.
1157930	1161893	Holy Shonen in chat says, LOL, the ideal of next gen, flushing toilets.
1162614	1165716	Gold Banjo says, OMG, how far technology has taken us.
1165736	1166637	It's exciting.
1166937	1167217	All right.
1167498	1168819	I'm feeling very confident about people's gaming.
1168859	1170540	I'm glad DarkSakura is feeling my thing.
1170760	1172902	I was just shocked as well, just flushing that toilet.
1172922	1173943	We're like, this is it.
1174043	1174944	This is next gen.
1175024	1175264	All right.
1175384	1176065	Well, we're going to let you go.
1176085	1177126	This gives me hope for the future.
1177246	1180108	So you can go get your copy of Bioshock and flush all the toilets, okay?
1180640	1181020	All right, bye.
1211738	1220202	Yeah, they... Actually, they've been doing a lot of restructuring because they have really bad money management because of the whole hot coffee incident.
1220242	1221983	They poured millions of dollars down that.
1222323	1223683	They're actually way down.
1224624	1230046	Yeah, and especially the fact that they don't really have anything new coming out this year now also kind of has to hurt them a little bit.
1231207	1231907	Yeah, definitely.
1232507	1233327	So, yeah.
1234808	1236709	Is that all you wanted to comment on, or is there other stuff tonight?
1237889	1238890	Well, um...
1239693	1244636	I don't know, I didn't really get into the feed until after Part B, and Part B wasn't that long.
1245536	1251840	Well, I know, because we have to make sure we get the Skype in before 8 o'clock tonight, but our podcast will still have everything in it, all the stories and everything.
1252140	1253561	Well, what games have you been playing this week?
1255122	1256703	I've been playing a lot of Half-Life 2, actually.
1257163	1257423	Yeah?
1258784	1262386	Because I just got a new computer, and I got this headset just so I could Skype in and call you guys.
1262707	1263247	Awesome!
1263752	1264292	Cool, thank you.
1265133	1266474	So wait, you brought a brand new computer?
1266514	1270118	So is it like a top of the line, or is it like a Costco computer, or what?
1271399	1272419	It's kind of a budget computer.
1272480	1273160	It's like a Dell, $600.
1273580	1279245	I was like, eh, I want something that plays games, but I don't want something that will kill my wallet.
1279446	1281187	So you probably won't be playing Bioshock on it.
1282568	1283909	Ah, man, I wish I could.
1283929	1284550	Do you have a 360?
1286331	1289414	No, I just have a Wii for now.
1289494	1291436	I'm not getting into the next gen until...
1292345	1295207	They fixed the stability issues on the Xbox 360.
1295948	1300011	You know, actually, Ross Steele kind of brings up a follow-up point in the chatroom.
1300051	1306336	Ross Steele, UT, says as far as Take-Two, because 2K is a part of that, and says they almost have nothing other than GTA.
1306416	1308958	Bioshock might be their first post-GTA hit.
1309438	1311860	So maybe they do have a game this year that's going to bring in the money.
1312779	1315300	I thought it was 2K that was doing Bioshock.
1315320	1318621	It is 2K that's doing Bioshock, but don't they all roll up in Take-Two?
1319121	1321682	Take-Two owns 2K and they also own Rockstar.
1321762	1323783	Yeah, so it's just different subsidiaries of Take-Two.
1324123	1325263	Oh, I see.
1325403	1326124	Interesting.
1328064	1334566	I just wanted to, like, every time a great game comes out for the Xbox 360, I'm like, man, I wish I had an Xbox 360.
1334967	1340469	And then I hear stories of like, oh man, my Xbox 360 broke just before this game came out.
1340649	1341349	What am I going to do?
1341489	1341809	And I'm like,
1342678	1344179	I don't want to get that anymore.
1344540	1348183	Well, at least they have the warranty thing, so it's a little better now.
1348883	1349104	All right.
1349384	1350965	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
1351866	1352646	No, that's about it.
1352927	1353187	All right.
1353287	1355008	Well, thank you so much for calling, and have a good week, okay?
1355889	1356209	Yeah, you too.
1356229	1357190	Have fun with the new computer.
1358011	1358431	All right.
1358471	1358692	Bye.
1358952	1359212	Bye-bye.
1359960	1365082	I wonder if he'll be playing World of Warcraft on that computer because there's a lot of people who go out and get those budget computers to play World of Warcraft.
1365122	1365422	We'll see.
1366122	1367102	We'll take a couple more calls.
1367122	1370984	If you'd like to give us a call, again, the number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1371104	1373625	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
1373845	1375845	But don't call now because we have another call on the line right now.
1376145	1376426	Hi.
1376726	1377426	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
1377446	1377766	Who's this?
1378746	1379066	Hey, guys.
1379086	1379327	What's up?
1379367	1379967	It's FootyMonster.
1380127	1380967	Hello, FootyMonster.
1380987	1381487	What's on your mind?
1382508	1382948	Nothing much.
1382968	1386569	I actually wanted to share with you guys something that I learned during the past day.
1387905	1391087	The Hannah Montana game for the DS actually seems to be really good.
1391787	1392287	What is this?
1393228	1395089	Hannah Montana, you know, that Disney show?
1395109	1395849	Wait, wait, wait.
1396569	1398650	Hannah Montana for the DS is good?
1400151	1400391	Yes.
1400691	1404493	Another one that's a platformer that's out already, but the one that's going to come out soon.
1405373	1406074	Now, how do you know this?
1407094	1410696	Because I checked the video that was posted on DS Fanboy on Friday.
1411837	1419480	And basically the game is like jam sessions for the DS where you have the guitar, you can strum it and play chords and stuff.
1420100	1425202	But take this to the next level where you can not only strum but also pick individual strings.
1425803	1429544	Also you get a full drum kit in which you can actually play everything on the drum.
1430474	1434637	A bass guitar, and also you have connectivity with other DSs, and you can play on Wi-Fi.
1434677	1435698	Each person takes an instrument.
1435718	1436999	You can all jam together, actually.
1437159	1438940	The chat room is all surprised that you're serious.
1440201	1440641	I'm serious.
1440761	1441842	I'm completely serious.
1441942	1448007	It looks like Rock Band meets Jam Sessions with a really bad IP sticking on the front.
1448207	1448507	I see.
1448567	1452650	So Hannah Montana is a music game that looks to be really good, basically.
1452790	1452910	Yeah.
1453270	1454071	It's a music game.
1454091	1457374	So it's not good because I don't get to punch her in the face or anything.
1457394	1458675	That's not what makes it good, right?
1458976	1460036	It's actually a good game.
1460557	1460837	Wow.
1461838	1462859	It seems to be a good game.
1462899	1471587	I mean, I actually called to Bobby Blackpool's show before and he said that he thinks that he heard that they might re-release
1472057	1476639	without the IP, like the Hannah Montana IP slapped into it, like developers.
1477019	1479059	That would be hilarious if they did that.
1479419	1486162	Can you guys think of any other games that were like that, that were actually pretty good games that just had a crappy brand on it?
1487282	1488322	I'm trying to think if there's anything else.
1488362	1490303	I'm like, surely there was something else in gaming history.
1490603	1492024	Maybe the chat room can think of something.
1492064	1498426	Like, was there a great concept for a game or a great game that just got totally screwed by the IP that was attached to it?
1498446	1499146	Cool Spot?
1500738	1501739	Oh, Spot, the video game?
1501779	1502440	Yeah, Cool Spot.
1503201	1504963	Oh, like all the way back in the NES days?
1505023	1505563	Super NES.
1506324	1507205	Oh, I don't remember that one.
1507926	1510668	I remember the old board game one that was kind of like Othello.
1511089	1513952	Well, no, this is with the Spot from 7-Up.
1513972	1514633	7-Up, yeah.
1515193	1516154	So he had a game on the NES.
1516174	1516915	There were the Noid games.
1516955	1517736	Yeah, as a platformer.
1518036	1518577	The Noid games?
1518617	1519157	Wasn't he good?
1519658	1521560	They were actually kind of... They were...
1522390	1523192	A good waste of time.
1523312	1523432	Oh!
1523633	1524234	Vector Man.
1524314	1524995	Sneak King.
1525115	1525476	Hello.
1525817	1526799	We did have one recently.
1527300	1527981	But actually, I don't know.
1528021	1529644	The Burger King IP kind of made it, actually.
1529684	1529965	I don't know.
1530205	1531307	I wouldn't say that was a bad IP.
1531828	1532289	But, huh.
1533174	1538117	And now I'm just curious about if High School Musical 2, the game, is going to be coming out any soon.
1538157	1539037	I still have Shane's CD.
1539177	1542219	Well, High School Musical, the game, just came out in DS last week.
1542940	1548062	And it's coming out, the karaoke game's coming out on PlayStation 2 and Wii in November.
1549483	1553185	All I have to do is go to Disneyland and then run away from them while they chase me.
1553505	1555507	So, Footy Monster, I'm just shocked.
1555527	1558028	A very unlikely recommendation for Hannah Montana.
1558068	1558628	But you know what?
1558688	1561410	I guess this will truly put people to the test.
1562674	1563635	Is a good game.
1564356	1566597	Is a good game a good game a good game no matter what?
1567037	1575523	And if you remember though, they do have that special Disney like Xbox Live type service that's starting with the Hannah Montana 2 game too.
1577064	1580126	I just posted the link to the story and the video in chat.
1580506	1581987	So just check it out for yourselves.
1582027	1586510	I mean really, it's like I can tell you Hannah Montana seems to be a good game and you're probably going to laugh at me.
1586550	1590273	But once you see that, actually look at people's reactions in the chat room.
1591801	1593282	I can't believe that he's right.
1593322	1594462	It looks to be pretty cool.
1595123	1597944	The fact that you can actually jam like it was Rock Band.
1598004	1602787	It's like people said it's jam sessions for the DS mixed with Rock Band with a crap IP.
1602967	1605209	Then how the fuck did Hannah Montana get her name on this?
1605249	1606049	That's what I want to know.
1606429	1607550	I'm looking at this right now.
1608430	1611672	So wait, I'm going to play this little video here just because I can.
1612113	1613633	This is coming from DSFanboy.
1613653	1614454	This is my cameraman.
1616080	1617221	So where's this video?
1617241	1618842	Oh, it's going to stream a lot here.
1618862	1619782	Let me take a little bit.
1619942	1622183	This is not going to be good.
1622704	1624184	It's a kind of slow video.
1624224	1627946	I don't know why the person doesn't really show the game screen that much.
1627966	1629127	They show the guy talking.
1629367	1629787	Yeah, I know.
1629807	1631368	I don't want to see the dude talking.
1631428	1633349	I just want to see the screen.
1633409	1636851	But they show the screen a couple of times and you can get the feel of the game.
1637151	1644075	You can record up to two minutes, even if you're playing Wi-Fi, so you can actually record two minutes of something.
1644674	1648278	if you're recording with your buddies, and that kind of thing.
1648398	1654504	So it seems to be pretty feature complete, which is kind of impressive.
1654924	1657647	Son of Dad says, the license kills this game.
1657727	1659368	No hardcore gamer will buy this.
1660609	1661050	I will buy it.
1662491	1664093	Oh, you dare to defy.
1665534	1667336	Well, here's the best part, though.
1667356	1667796	Sorry, go ahead.
1669895	1676500	I was going to say, if it's a game like this where, you know, it's not going to be that popular, it means it'll just be in a bargain bin pretty quick, and then you can pick it up.
1677981	1682705	But it might be popular because of the fact that, oh, he's like strumming the little guitar with the DS thing.
1682725	1683906	Yeah.
1683986	1685427	It's kind of... Very interesting.
1685487	1687508	Talk about gaming gems in the strangest places.
1687668	1689790	I mean, wow, there's like little drums, too.
1698547	1699408	That is something else.
1700069	1701030	I might have to check that out.
1702292	1707318	Real quickly before we let you go, I know you also co-host a podcast about strictly role-playing games, right?
1708419	1708980	That is correct.
1709381	1710823	Am I allowed to plug it?
1710883	1711684	Yes, you may plug it.
1713326	1714788	It's The Ultimate Quest.
1714808	1716590	You can find it on ultimatequest.net.
1717915	1721397	The next show is probably going to be released in the next few days, so yeah, there you go.
1721718	1725520	Well, what I want to ask you about Ultimate Quest, I know Blue Dragon is coming out very soon.
1725540	1726561	Are you excited about this?
1726581	1728682	Because it's been getting some mixed reception from people.
1729763	1732765	I would be excited about it if it wasn't for two reasons.
1732905	1742851	First off, one of the other co-hosts on the show, Jack Ransom, Shadowslayer, better known, he actually played the demo and also did Xenocore, and they both agreed that it's...
1744039	1744899	Really nice looking.
1744959	1748841	It's something that the 360 doesn't really have in excess, which is like a traditional RPG.
1749341	1751822	But that's it.
1753603	1758865	So that the whole thing that they look really like little kids will put off any hardcore 360 game.
1760205	1762086	Anything that doesn't have a 360, so whatever.
1762406	1763067	Alright, we'll see.
1763227	1765808	Alright, anyway, we've had John for a long time, so we've got to let you go.
1766268	1768769	But thanks so much for the call and for the tip on Hannah Montana.
1768809	1769249	Who would have known?
1770165	1770625	Yeah, no worries.
1770645	1771766	I got to spread the Montana love.
1771786	1772187	That's all.
1773248	1773588	Take care.
1773668	1774328	Have a good flight.
1774449	1776450	I understand you have a 14-hour flight tomorrow, so have a good flight.
1776650	1776991	All right.
1777011	1777491	Thanks a lot, man.
1777511	1777711	All right.
1777731	1778112	Bye-bye.
1778172	1779273	See you.
1779513	1779773	See you.
1780674	1783216	He's breaking up a little bit there at the end, too, so it's probably for the best.
1784137	1785158	We'll take one more call.
1785258	1785838	One more call.
1785899	1786199	Why not?
1786739	1789281	If anybody else decides to call in.
1789301	1791303	1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number.
1791743	1794525	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
1795085	1795666	Waiting for it.
1795786	1796326	One more call.
1796486	1797647	Give it a second because of the buffer.
1797727	1799889	I'm trying to see what else is going on in chat here.
1800990	1801770	Let's see.
1802611	1805513	Joshi16 says he's pimping Montana out on the streets.
1807434	1810316	Footy is back in chat saying that game will rock everybody's socks.
1812078	1812178	Um...
1812645	1813565	Looks interesting, though.
1813625	1817126	They've got some good screenshots on IGN or something.
1817826	1823347	And it's got a little too much sparkles and pink for my taste, but I don't know.
1823547	1828568	I like that idea, though, that maybe the developers will release the game without the Hannah Montana IP, like it's a different game.
1829169	1833330	HitStun says, you could say the GBA Astro Boy was brought down a little by its license.
1833370	1834930	The original Astro Boy is hard to watch.
1835870	1836670	Talking about IPs.
1837050	1839871	All right, well, unfortunately, there's no other calls coming on the Skype line for right now.
1840567	1861498	and so we're going to go back to the news and just so you know the live listeners Live 365 may dump the show at any time unfortunately it will be inevitable we'll just have to keep going but we're going to keep recording tonight's show and of course you'll be able to hear the full thing and anything you might miss because of the Live 365 dump tonight you can certainly hear it on our podcast which you can download of course at
1863383	1866986	We would have done the mailbag segment right now, but unfortunately we didn't get a whole lot of emails.
1867086	1870249	But if you do want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelandradio.com.
1870669	1874412	If you wanted to maybe call in tonight and get the chance to, you could always send us an email.
1874832	1876394	And DarkSakura always reads through the emails.
1876554	1877114	But not this week.
1877434	1877595	Yes.
1878035	1880977	And let us know what you think about Hannah Montana, the game.
1881257	1888163	Especially because I know there's a lot of music gaming fans that listen to this program because of our history that we did obviously a lot with music games in the past.
1888783	1890365	This is a very interesting...
1891385	1896246	I think a lot of people have said in the past, you know, DDR is starting to look more and more like a game for little girls.
1896766	1901027	This doesn't help the music gaming genre break out of that stereotype.
1902287	1911909	All right, well, let's get back into some gaming news and talk about... We were talking a lot before we went to Skype about how Sony is kind of getting all these ideas from other places.
1911949	1915330	At least it seems like, it feels like, and this story certainly doesn't help.
1915670	1916890	You remember Africa and...
1918945	1921206	The game we saw at E3, what, a couple years ago?
1921606	1924347	That, like, everybody looked at it going, what the fuck is that?
1924527	1926387	Well, we still don't know what the fuck that is.
1926407	1927468	Is it Jamba Safari?
1927548	1928908	If so, that's fucking rad.
1928928	1931169	A harpoon, me and Gazelle.
1931309	1934950	But apparently the developer said you do not get to attack the animals in Africa.
1935290	1936990	Otherwise, they have said nothing about the game.
1937110	1938791	But there are rumors.
1939131	1942772	Again, I must stress rumors because I think this sounds like a load of crap.
1943392	1945713	But the rumor is going out saying...
1946763	1957152	Sony is supposedly going to be releasing a Wii Fit type touchpad to go with Africa to make the Safari experience complete.
1957792	1961115	Now my question is, how in the fuck does that work?
1962896	1966099	Do you stand on it and then it just like shakes?
1966219	1967540	It's Rhinoceros' approach?
1967560	1969561	That makes no sense to me whatsoever.
1970182	1972704	That's why I think this was totally pulled out of somebody's butt.
1973803	1978527	The other thing, too, that's also suggesting that Africa is going to be out in, like, January.
1980809	1983431	So, I don't think so, since we haven't heard anything about it.
1984132	1985673	And it's Africa.
1985853	1988456	Well, could they delay it to maybe add something in?
1988536	1989597	I mean, who knows?
1989697	1992059	Well, it wouldn't be out before the Wii Fit, then, now would it?
1992519	1992719	All right.
1993100	1998044	Well, this kind of was an interesting story, but I do take it with a huge grain of salt.
1998484	1998704	Yeah.
1999245	1999325	Um.
2000256	2022584	Something else that's interesting, part of EA's plan to totally dominate everything that exists in the world, they are now partnering up with Hasbro to release games based on their favorite properties, including Monopoly, Risk, and Scrabble, as well as toys including GI Joe, Tonka, Nerf, and Littlest Pet Shop.
2023484	2025025	They're still doing Littlest Pet Shop?
2025165	2027585	I didn't even realize there was a Littlest Pet Shop.
2028826	2028946	Um...
2030885	2031245	Yay?
2032286	2034026	I don't know, Nerf would be kind of neat.
2034686	2036247	Like a first person shooter Nerf game.
2036787	2038328	I think they actually have had that before.
2038348	2040949	I'd put that in the category of good for them.
2043290	2045831	I wonder if this means Monopoly on Xbox Live Arcade.
2046871	2048151	Because that's what we really need.
2048572	2049192	That and Scrabble.
2049472	2054614	No, because then people will never stop playing because a Monopoly game on average takes about six hours.
2055954	2056255	Awesome.
2056795	2060116	Well, at least you can't have someone cheat as the banker.
2063045	2081190	Speaking of online games though, Park Associates, who is big for running those studies on online activities, said that there are 34% of adult users on the internet playing games as compared to 29% on YouTube and 19% on MySpace and Facebook.
2084714	2092139	So they have shown a 79% growth in online gaming over the year and only 46% in social networking.
2093400	2094681	So we likes our games.
2095021	2095682	Keep them going.
2098124	2103868	And on top of that, though, I've noticed a lot of online games have that social aspect already combined with it.
2104248	2106850	Because I'll tell you half the reason I used to play Ragnarok Online.
2107555	2110637	I totally believe that casual games are as big as sometimes the hardcore gamers forget to admit.
2126639	2140083	You know, because again, I use the example of walking around in the workplace and looking at little cubicles and so many people playing those freaking, you know, PopCap games like Collapse and what have you, you know, like it's an incredible business.
2140303	2142003	They're not supposed to be doing that at work.
2142103	2142603	Well, they do.
2143343	2144324	They can do it on their breaks.
2145164	2145724	Wink, wink.
2146064	2147264	Not on our breaks at my work.
2147525	2148165	Oh, that's too bad.
2148285	2149365	We get stabbed in the head.
2149705	2149985	Really?
2150425	2151005	Yeah, really.
2151486	2151966	That sucks.
2152086	2152886	It's an HR issue.
2154369	2159238	Alright, anyway, this might be a future HR issue if you're caught playing this game at work.
2159338	2161101	It's Super Chick Sisters!
2161795	2163256	You might have heard of this game this week.
2163336	2164297	It's from PETA.
2164617	2171923	People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released this game called Super Chick Sisters as part of their website, KentuckyFriedCruelty.com.
2172423	2174225	I played the game, and you know what?
2174265	2176386	I've got to tell you, it's not bad.
2176567	2179149	For a little homebrew cook-up title, it's not bad.
2179449	2180490	And it's very tongue-in-cheek.
2180510	2183672	It's obvious that the people who made the game know a little something about video games.
2183972	2185434	Because, like, okay, basically here it is.
2185454	2190818	The premise of the video game, it's kind of like a Mario Brothers rip-off, but instead of Mario Brothers, you have a little chicken.
2191238	2191758	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2214682	2218386	and Mario and Luigi are suffering from a case of Wii-itis.
2218426	2220929	They've been playing too much Nintendo Wii, so their hands are broken.
2221349	2226375	So they can't go rescue, so they have to rely on Chick and Nugget.
2227276	2228998	So you go through these Mario-type levels.
2229058	2232802	Instead of collecting coins, you collect these little birds, and then they give you little facts.
2233362	2234684	Did you play it?
2234704	2234904	I wish.
2236045	2236746	I did play it.
2237006	2240069	And I wish more of my, like, Mario Brothers games would have that.
2240489	2244893	Hey, did you know that they chop the beaks off of chickens and don't even do anything?
2245554	2248677	It's like, and did you realize that they boil them alive?
2248897	2250258	That's so horrible.
2250358	2254122	Did you know that they put chickens in the incinerator and boil them?
2254522	2256604	I mean, I was just like, this is amazing.
2257005	2261609	I mean, I'm kind of, like, parking news, KFC tortures chickens.
2262678	2267399	Part of me wants to invite PETA on this show, even though they are such a controversial organization.
2267739	2269960	But part of me goes like, why did you do this?
2270100	2272161	Like, why did you make a game out of this?
2272201	2274801	You do realize there are copyright laws out there?
2274861	2281663	I mean, there's like, they weren't at all like trying to say, oh, yeah, it's Larry and, you know.
2282586	2284287	and Barry or something.
2285007	2289690	It's Mario and Luigi and they have Toad in there and they use the Wii and they're not afraid about that.
2289710	2294132	In fact, at one point Mario gets beat up for being cruel to turtles.
2295052	2298414	Oh my god, you played to level 3 to get that message, I know.
2299455	2305297	Yeah, level 3 was Mario gets beat up by the people for ethical treatment of turtles or something like that.
2305938	2312101	I mean, it's very tongue-in-cheek but it's funny and it's, you know, whether you agree or disagree with PETA
2313004	2316125	It's kind of an interesting way to get their message across.
2316625	2319987	The thing I would want to ask PETA, and I swear I'm going to send them an email this week and try to get them on the show.
2320587	2327089	I want to know, why did they choose to make a game out of this to get their message?
2327289	2333852	Is it because they want to get to that stereotype World of Warcraft player who's doing an all-night raid with a bucket of wings in his lap?
2333912	2335993	Are they trying to get those guys to think twice?
2336013	2336873	That game made me hungry.
2338173	2341255	I've got a $5 gift certificate to KFC.
2341275	2342095	I'm thinking about...
2343072	2345036	Using me to get me some chicken.
2345196	2345797	Stop.
2346058	2349945	Even if you read all about the torturous ways of... This is kind of funny.
2350667	2351609	I'm kind of digging this game.
2352029	2352751	It's interesting, isn't it?
2352771	2353332	I'm big already.
2353913	2354615	Alright, so...
2355765	2358727	DarkTetsuyu in chat says, Nintendo will sue.
2359267	2362089	Frisbee says, this makes me want KFC even more.
2362409	2368052	Joshi16 says, but if it's for a good cause, they don't have to care about laws and restrictions.
2368112	2370093	Just look at gross anti-smoking commercials.
2370454	2373796	But my question is, you know, PIPEDA is a very controversial organization.
2373816	2374456	There's a lot of
2374676	2381897	And they may not want, yeah, they may not want their, especially, I don't think they gave, obviously they did not give them permission, you know, for this stuff.
2382038	2386098	It's sort of like, what's the business, is it Walmart that doesn't allow anybody out front of their store?
2386118	2386678	No, it's Target.
2387039	2389519	Target does not allow anybody out front of their store, no matter who they are.
2389559	2392780	I mean, it could be Girl Scouts or anything, they do not allow anybody out front of their store.
2393060	2394500	It's just to be consistent policy.
2394760	2400341	You know, they don't want their name tied to any, you know, Republican, Democrat initiative or whatever it is.
2400901	2402082	So, I think it's Target.
2402122	2403782	I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but...
2404615	2406116	I sure as hell know it's not Walmart.
2406196	2413041	Maybe Nintendo wants to be like that where they don't want to be tied to any organization and I somehow doubt they were asked about this.
2414262	2419726	WonderDogHerald says PETA, as usual, likes to appeal to children for their tactics.
2419766	2422108	People eating tasty animals.
2423189	2424850	You guys keep saying stuff like that.
2424870	2426011	They're not going to want to come on the show.
2426171	2428813	I like chicken.
2430454	2432955	I didn't get the whole pipe level.
2432995	2435096	That frustrated me and I turned it off.
2435436	2437536	Yeah, level 3 was... I stopped at level 3 too.
2437637	2439017	It was too hard to figure out.
2439057	2439777	A little over the top.
2440497	2441878	Someone needs some better level design.
2441898	2444859	Again, for a homebrew game, which essentially it is, it's not bad.
2444899	2446720	I mean, it's obvious a lot of effort went into this.
2446760	2450761	It wasn't... That's what surprised me most about it is that it wasn't cheaply put together.
2451505	2452986	The Colonel with the Spider-Robot
2472222	2481348	Anyways, Ubisoft is now talking about a brand new top secret game that they have in development that's going to be focusing on user-generated content.
2481388	2485090	I guess you could kind of compare it to LittleBigPlanet or something of that sort.
2485610	2497418	Anyways, it will allow gamers to support their creations across platforms, sending out pie-in-the-sky meters, or apparently, according to Joyce, it's sending their pie-in-the-sky meters off the charts, but...
2499042	2499342	I don't know.
2499562	2499822	Great.
2499862	2507705	I think a lot more companies are going to start taking this stance and allowing more user created content instead of banning that.
2507825	2510566	Look at Forza 2 with the whole creating cars.
2511006	2513707	Halo 3 with the new videos that they're uploading.
2513747	2516108	Hell, even before that with Burnout.
2516468	2520289	Revenge where you can upload your gameplay footage and stuff.
2520329	2522530	SingStar where you're going to be able to do the same thing.
2524510	2526131	Something that we're probably going to see more of.
2529637	2529937	All right.
2530417	2537683	Well, DarkSakura likes to surf the Internet up and down every single week and choose a website of her liking to share with all of you.
2538184	2540005	And we call it her website of the week.
2540025	2542767	And I'm curious what DarkSakura has picked out for the kids this week.
2543148	2544169	Let's play the music and see.
2552015	2555218	The website of the week is PETAKillsAnimals.com.
2557600	2558120	What, Rob?
2558954	2561295	Oh boy, there went our chances of getting PETA on the show.
2561835	2573040	It's basically... Actually, their most recent news were about the recent PETA trial in North Carolina for animal cruelty.
2573500	2582924	Basically, they had to submit the numbers of the amount of animals that they had actually killed involved in their research.
2583404	2584605	They have, on their...
2586539	2588961	I remembered some of this from being on Penn & Teller's Bullshit recently.
2589962	2590702	Great show, by the way.
2592243	2599588	Where one of the charges on their inventories was for a walk-in freezer that cost $9,370.
2604443	2605863	What about Vegetables?
2623641	2624221	Well, no.
2624441	2626623	That's a lot of frozen peas.
2626663	2632245	But there was just quite a bit on here about exactly what they spelled.
2632485	2638348	The head of PETA is actually on, you know how they say, oh, well, don't use this medication because it was tested on animals?
2639029	2649434	The head of PETA is actually on insulin that was, the research was done on animal testing and derived from animal products.
2651017	2652418	I just thought it was very interesting.
2653339	2655080	Pretty much a company run by hypocrites, but well.
2658303	2662006	Well, I guess we always have to have a counterpoint to every point made on the show, so there you have it.
2663567	2667891	All right, anyhow, let's talk a little bit about Squeenix.
2668652	2677479	We love Square Enix, and they are opening their brand new store online on August 20th, and they even have a time, 6 p.m.
2677519	2678160	Pacific time.
2678456	2686863	There's going to be a brand new online shop opening up and it's supposed to have Square Enix collectibles, model kits, and clothing accessories.
2687463	2691586	And I wonder if that means buttons or if you'll be able to buy full cosplay on the website.
2691606	2692387	That would be pretty awesome.
2693628	2698091	Probably some of those Final Fantasy XII action figures like the Balthier one, which I have.
2698111	2701254	Because Balthier is very awesome in Final Fantasy XII.
2701721	2705406	So if you're a Square Enix fan, I'm sure you're going to be hitting up their website on August 20, 2007.
2706006	2716199	Unfortunately, I don't recall exactly where the website is located, but I'm sure if you go to Square Enix's website at squareenix.com, there'll be a link right there when the store opens.
2716539	2717520	So be on the lookout for it.
2718702	2720504	Well, if in case you're wondering...
2722507	2725929	What those large hard drives are for on the PlayStation 3?
2726609	2727830	Well, wonder no more.
2728390	2734854	Actually, they are going to be releasing a digital tuner for recording TV.
2735634	2740037	And it's supposed to be unveiled at LibZig here pretty soon.
2740697	2747060	So this has been confirmed by 3Speech, their semi-official blog for Sony.
2750342	2750742	All right.
2751543	2751783	Well...
2752358	2760542	In other news, they are talking about the chip manufacturers that are behind the Wii shortage.
2761363	2768587	Nintendo wants to up production from what I'm understanding, but they are not able to get the chips they need still.
2769107	2776971	The ones who are making the components are saying that if it keeps up like that, they're not going to be able to keep up with the demand.
2779473	2780173	I'm not surprised.
2783160	2783461	All right.
2783921	2789290	Well, talking about electronic arts for a minute, going on over to Macintosh Gaming.
2791086	2795510	You know, Mac sometimes gets a bad rap because they don't really have a lot of games on it.
2795530	2800253	But you might have heard early in the year, EA is supposed to be, you know, kind of helping out a little bit more.
2800833	2804596	And EA has actually shipped four games for the Macintosh.
2805197	2813002	They've shipped Battlefield 2142, Need for Speed Carbon, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars.
2813322	2818206	So for those of you saying there are no games available on the Mac, well, there's four pretty big titles right there, especially Command & Conquer 3.
2818246	2819627	A lot of people love their Command & Conquer games.
2819867	2820527	So there you have it.
2820547	2827390	In fact, I got a message earlier this week online asking if I played Command & Conquer, if I wanted to play, and I said, no, you'd have to ask Loki, because I don't really play that.
2827410	2829590	I don't have Command & Conquer 3, so there you have it.
2829630	2830231	I used to play it, though.
2831631	2833052	Anyways, let's see.
2834512	2842295	I was going to say, there's been some interesting stuff going on in the whole EA Wikipedia article there.
2842595	2849297	Apparently, some EA staffers have been changing a little bit of history on there, removing key facts.
2849755	2850836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2877248	2890139	EA did come out and say they sometimes update websites with info about company, games, and employees.
2890179	2896385	For example, EA has sent a correction to Yahoo Finance when they had misspelled the name of an EA executive.
2896874	2903059	Many companies routinely post updates on websites like Wikipedia to ensure accuracy of their own corporate information.
2903599	2913827	However, I think deleting information that is negative about your company's past is not exactly, I don't know, following that.
2914228	2915949	It's basically just... Poor ethics.
2916189	2918831	Yeah, it's hiding the bad spots.
2919552	2923375	Like, Wikipedia doesn't allow you to edit an article that's up about yourself, right?
2923695	2926257	Yeah, in fact, that is a major violation...
2926539	2926760	Yeah.
2927702	2929988	Like, for instance, I don't touch the OLR article.
2930429	2934701	I mean, there is an Orange Lounge Radio article on Wikipedia how it survived this long against their, you know...
2935123	2937423	Notability Rules, I have no idea, but hey, it's there.
2937884	2942805	Probably because, I guess, since we were lucky enough to have the news articles, then there's been other sources about us, but whatever.
2943285	2948526	I've never touched the article, although I'm always fascinated reading the updates and the work that other people have put into it.
2948906	2953247	But I just won't touch it because I'm like, well, that's kind of weird.
2953267	2957267	There's things I want to go fix in it, like some of the shows that aren't on anymore.
2957287	2958488	I've fixed grammatical errors.
2958928	2959308	Did you?
2959508	2959908	Yes, I have.
2960048	2960948	Well, I guess that's different.
2960988	2964809	Grammatical errors is one thing, but I don't touch it because, I don't know, it's weird.
2966639	2968942	Some folks in chat are saying, you're welcome, you're welcome.
2969522	2973747	Joshi16 says, Wikipedia is becoming corporate propaganda machine.
2974348	2974809	Interesting.
2975504	3004727	interesting perspective you know that's not the only Wikipedia thing I read about this week I heard that the was it the ESA supposedly was going on to Wikipedia and had edited some articles on like Abandonware and stuff too and they were deleting things like there's some IPs traced back I want to say I read something about that I think I remember that too yeah so kind of interesting all this Wikipedia information that's come out this week I think ours needs a bit of an update I was just looking at it yeah it probably needs a small update but I don't want to do it myself so maybe a kind listener will go in there and clean it up we'll see
3006980	3010481	Anyways, let's see.
3011921	3016743	Well, actually, I had a little bit of news in regards to stuff coming out on the Virtual Console and the PSP.
3017203	3017803	Sure.
3018743	3022264	There is actually a Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest.
3023585	3025545	It has actually been rated for a Wii release.
3026246	3031587	And LucasArts is bringing out Indiana Jones to the PSP, tentatively titled as Indiana Jones 2008.
3031627	3032247	But it's not Lego.
3037069	3039510	Dude, I wonder if it's based on the old Indiana Jones arcade game.
3039530	3040950	That game was pretty awesome.
3040970	3044691	Well, they did have, was it that Indiana Jones game that was being worked on by LucasArts?
3044892	3047932	The one that was supposed to be all, you know... That was the Indiana Jones 2008.
3048093	3051594	Yeah, but still, this could be something like that.
3052654	3055095	Or maybe tying in with the new Indiana Jones movie.
3056195	3056435	Maybe.
3056455	3057636	I don't know.
3057696	3059036	Harrison Ford is too old.
3060236	3061037	He's never too old.
3061217	3062157	They'll make him a robot.
3062317	3065238	Well, I guess if Bruce Willis can do it, Harrison Ford can.
3068018	3069119	Dementium, The War Dementium
3094902	3100465	and I guess it's actually based off an independent title by Renegade Kid.
3101585	3111590	And Dementium is a mature rated game and it looks like it's going to be kind of like that type Silent Hill horror type game.
3111970	3114111	I was actually thinking of the Call of Cthulhu game.
3115552	3122115	Well, remember they have that one was a Touch the Dead a while back that was also a mature rated title that was more of a shooter, but...
3122660	3127622	I think around the same site, Insecticides was coming out on the DS as well, so that one was pretty cool.
3127642	3132443	That was that adventure game that was kind of film noir, but with insects.
3132943	3136885	We don't see a lot of survival horror on the DS, so kind of interesting.
3137005	3137485	It looks good.
3139105	3145748	I haven't seen too much on this game, but I'm always interested in more survival horror games, because they always succeed in scaring the pants off of me.
3146328	3147048	So, there you have it.
3147645	3148505	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3169916	3170677	until we get booted.
3170957	3172718	I don't know if any more calls will come in, but we'll see.
3173078	3173318	Okay.
3173998	3175079	I've got some last-minute stories.
3175439	3185364	Ninja Gaiden 2 is going to be debuting on the Xbox 360, and with PlayStation 3 coming later on, it's supposed to debut at Tokyo Game Show.
3185404	3188145	That is the rumor coming from GameSpot Korea.
3188906	3190887	So it'll be interesting to check that out.
3192208	3193008	Let's see here.
3194621	3198105	Halo 3, of course, nearing completion, almost gold right now.
3198625	3204451	And there's been some interesting details on this new Bungie Pro program that's going to be happening.
3204971	3215341	And basically what Bungie Pro is, is it's going to be a... Anyone that has a copy of Halo 3 and a gold subscription will be allocated six slots...
3215888	3216808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3237742	3238322	DecaSporta Volleyball
3263956	3265456	Let's see what else here.
3265556	3273799	Halo the movie has been apparently reconfirmed that it's coming and is apparently already filming in New Zealand.
3273979	3274379	Bullshit.
3275019	3276659	Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.
3276719	3278880	This is coming from XboxFamily.com.
3279460	3282581	So I don't believe it, but we'll see.
3283921	3285242	That it?
3285402	3286122	There's one other thing.
3286162	3287862	I heard some interesting stuff this week.
3288663	3290863	A game I did not realize was coming out this fall.
3291623	3293024	Apparently, was it...
3295103	3298910	Kingdom of Fire, Circle of Doom is supposed to be coming out in early December.
3300173	3301235	I thought that was coming out in 2008.
3302337	3304521	Speaking of upcoming games, what have you heard about Two Worlds?
3305114	3305294	RAD RAD
3332154	3334915	And, you know, the day and night cycles are supposed to be pretty cool.
3335135	3338377	And, I don't know, it's kind of like Oblivion, but it's all third person.
3339217	3342619	And I don't really know much beyond that.
3343239	3346461	It looks cool, but I think, unfortunately, it's coming out the same week as Bioshock.
3346501	3347401	Well, it would have been.
3347541	3348521	It speaks to a different audience.
3348561	3352823	It originally was supposed to come out last week, which would have been perfect, because it's Madden and that.
3352983	3356385	You know, that would have been a pretty good game to pick up if you're not into Madden.
3357162	3358143	Star Parodia Star Soldier Star Parodia
3382605	3383086	Bioshock PC Demo
3395239	3395919	Thank you for watching!
3420430	3422332	Maybe I'll get Bioshock for the PC over the 360.
3422972	3423273	Who knows?
3423313	3425314	But then again, I want achievement points because I'm an achievement player.
3425334	3426736	I don't think it's going to run that well on PC.
3427076	3428337	At least not on our PCs.
3428357	3429318	Probably not on my PC.
3429338	3429718	That's true.
3430579	3432581	One other thing to speak about here.
3432641	3437185	Nintendo Power has apparently given Metroid Prime 3 a 10 out of 10.
3438606	3439066	Wow!
3439306	3439627	Really?
3439707	3442809	A Nintendo run magazine giving their game a 10 out of 10?
3442869	3444471	That's so surprising.
3444491	3448014	Now hold on because something that the story notes is that
3448502	3457805	You may or may not remember, but Ocarina of Time only got a 9.5 from Nintendo Power, so the fact they gave this a 10 out of 10 does make your eyebrow race a little bit.
3457825	3460126	Oh, wow, okay, so a 9.5, because that's really different than a 10.
3462686	3466468	It's almost perfect, but Metroid, that's perfect.
3466848	3471189	You know, really, do you think they would have to sell more of Ocarina of Time?
3471209	3476811	I mean, I think that game sells itself, whereas Metroid Prime, you know, maybe it needs a little help to be...
3477678	3478599	Selling some of those units.
3503802	3507464	And a lot of folks are giving Bioshock, of course, very high scores.
3507484	3512747	Joshi16 in chat is pointing out that Bioshock got a 10 out of 10 from the original Xbox magazine.
3512787	3513767	But is that really a shock?
3514688	3514908	Is it?
3515248	3515548	Who knows?
3516588	3520310	NintendoManiac64 says Ocarina of Time's negative .5 was from Navi.
3521211	3521531	Listen!
3522351	3522671	Listen!
3523632	3524752	Listen, goddammit, listen!
3526373	3526653	All right.
3527294	3529675	Well, that pretty much does it for all the stories tonight.
3530355	3531736	I don't really think we have anything else.
3532998	3535279	I opened up the Skype line and told the chat they could call in.
3535319	3537340	I'll give one more shout if you guys want to get through.
3537360	3542262	1-877, because I guess they're still live and still going.
3542282	3546064	1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
3547765	3548325	Call!
3548945	3549365	We'll see.
3550306	3552107	If not... Ah, there we go.
3552287	3553167	We're getting some calls now.
3554027	3554828	Just takes a little bit.
3555348	3556248	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3556268	3556629	Who's this?
3557689	3558449	Legend of Saku.
3558770	3560610	Oh, see, because you missed the first wave.
3560630	3561751	What's on your mind, Saku?
3562689	3564290	I just came back from 8 on the break.
3564791	3566592	I had a little 2DX tournament today.
3568033	3570354	Managed to beat some chumps and, you know, distorted.
3570755	3573056	But yeah, Champions of the Coast wasn't so bad this weekend.
3574077	3576799	You were always going to some tournament on the East Coast, it seems like.
3577779	3579341	Actually, it was my first 2DX tournament.
3579761	3581962	Wow, well, how was the 2DX tournament set up?
3582022	3582463	Was it fun?
3583483	3584484	Yeah, it was pretty good.
3584544	3585665	I mean, there weren't, you know...
3586431	3586871	B-Mania 2DX Player
3607159	3608060	Of course, man.
3608880	3609421	But yeah.
3611022	3615566	But if there's anything that would make that whole weekend is just seeing a 2DX freestyle.
3615846	3617527	A 2DX freestyle?
3618288	3618508	Yes.
3618788	3619429	How did that work?
3619469	3626614	The break is the only place where you can freestyle any of their music or dancing machines.
3627475	3628836	Well, who did that and what did they do?
3630057	3635901	They did Tangerine Stream, some sort of homoerotic stuff.
3636061	3636962	No offense, but that's
3637725	3638545	Thank you for watching!
3659423	3674734	I don't know, I'm just thinking about a 360, but since, you know, the failure rate's too high, I don't know if Bioshock or anything like, you know, Halo 3 Gears of War would just be, would just outweigh all the risk in just buying a 360 in the first place.
3674774	3681038	Dude, you're the second caller tonight to tell us that the failure rate issues are making you contemplate the 360.
3681679	3681859	Dude.
3681899	3682880	That's making me nervous.
3683520	3684901	It's interesting.
3685001	3686342	And God forbid a PS3.
3687023	3688984	And I know I don't want to pick the latter.
3689679	3691660	So I don't really have that much of a choice right now.
3694262	3704769	Has a person who personally owns multiple Xbox 360 systems and has never had one crap out for heat issues... I don't know what the hell people are talking about.
3705069	3705690	I mean, seriously...
3706923	3714231	Okay, maybe you may have the unlikely situation where your system craps out.
3714411	3714992	Who gives a shit?
3715012	3717795	You have a fucking three-year warranty on the heat-related issues.
3718195	3719717	It gets replaced within a couple weeks.
3720138	3720918	That's the issue.
3721989	3727795	I don't get why Sony can make a PS3 that craps out at a blue moon and 360s is like what?
3738303	3739584	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3763684	3766487	I don't want to play out the horror stories of having to go through 8, 10 consoles.
3787025	3787766	Just to get it right.
3787806	3791992	I mean, it's just retarded to just have to go through multiple consoles.
3792013	3792273	Hold on.
3792553	3793154	Shut up for a minute.
3794076	3795277	Not you, Zach, but Loki.
3796259	3801447	I did have an Xbox 360 that did crap out on me after four days, and I was so fucking pissed when it happened.
3801467	3802849	You remember on this program, I was...
3803509	3806692	Don't you fucking buy 360 because they'll fucking die on you, blah, blah, blah.
3807032	3809374	I was so pissed when it happened, but I'm over it.
3809534	3810855	I mean, they were quick.
3811115	3812957	They got the job done.
3813317	3814738	I mean, it didn't take two or three weeks.
3814798	3815378	I had it back in a week.
3815398	3815959	They paid for shipping?
3816559	3817340	Yeah, they paid for everything.
3818314	3819294	Do they pay for shipping?
3820135	3821955	They sent me a box.
3822255	3824596	They sent me a coffin to send it back in.
3824796	3826076	I heard they don't do that anymore.
3826477	3827277	I think they still do.
3827297	3827817	That's the thing.
3827837	3830178	Then I have to incur charges.
3830198	3832038	You're not going to incur any charges.
3832058	3834879	Then you're talking about like they're going to have to replace the system eight times.
3834979	3838220	If that were the case, they wouldn't be selling millions of fucking consoles.
3838440	3840401	This wouldn't be like a hot selling item.
3841301	3843602	You already have that happening to certain people.
3843802	3845423	Here's what the problem is.
3845443	3851407	You hear fucking idiots on the goddamn internet that bitch like fucking little babies about their fucking console breaking.
3851667	3854528	Everyone's like, oh my god, all of them are breaking all at once.
3855269	3856189	Don't give me that bullshit.
3856209	3857070	I have a migraine now.
3858470	3858751	Alright.
3859331	3860432	Okay, hold on.
3861252	3866495	Here's my other thought though, is that what about that the new Xbox 360s have like the new chips in them or whatever?
3867105	3869126	Well, that's yet to be seen.
3869206	3881010	I mean, if those break out less, you know, like, you know, once in a blue moon or very, very rare, then I'll hop on it, you know, at the drop of a hat.
3881250	3882191	I'll tell you what.
3882331	3883231	I'll tell you what.
3886032	3888974	I'll tell you what, fine, you can go ahead and skip buying a 360.
3889074	3890214	I'll enjoy playing Bioshock.
3890234	3893136	You can go ahead and wait for the next big game to come out for the PlayStation 3.
3893276	3894637	I'm sure it'll be next year sometime.
3894777	3897879	I would say he could get it on PC, but he has a Mac, right?
3898039	3903222	I'm building a new PC anyway, so that's going to be happening in a few days once I start ordering the parts.
3904130	3906691	I've already set aside a good $1,500, $1,600 for.
3908932	3916436	The PC can hold me for now, and then hopefully by Christmas, once we know whether the new heatsinks will actually make a difference, then I'll think about it.
3916456	3919398	Well, the PC might hold you, but will it give it the reach around?
3920518	3920618	Oh.
3920638	3920998	I don't know.
3921219	3923200	La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
3923460	3931844	And on that note, look, Zaku, I appreciate the Springer-fied call this show got, but we appreciate the perspective.
3932164	3932344	Yes.
3932364	3933125	Sorry, Zaku.
3933565	3933945	Time's up.
3934383	3934845	Take care though.
3934946	3935087	Bye.
3937651	3938971	I can have new cars?
3939011	3944712	Seriously, people talking about fucking heat sinks and issues with a couple of... This is more than just Zaku, though.
3944992	3951233	This is your pent-up anger at all the internet blogs and people across the entire internet that have made people like Zaku.
3951253	3953154	I don't know what the fuck they want.
3953194	3956494	I mean, they've already made revisions to fix this problem.
3956514	3958295	They have a three-year fucking warranty on it.
3958615	3959995	What the hell more do you want?
3960115	3964256	I mean, if your Sony PlayStation 3 craps out on you, good luck getting it fixed.
3964716	3964776	Um...
3965433	3968055	Maybe it could, like, do my dishes, I don't know, it'd be pretty awesome.
3968075	3970516	I don't know, it's just, it's stupid, it really is.
3970576	3972377	Alright, another call, one more call, then this is it.
3973138	3974459	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
3975680	3977481	Hello, it's Paradox Vincent.
3977681	3979442	Hello, Paradox Vincent, what's on your mind?
3980643	3984225	Hey, long time no see, chat.
3985446	3990349	Not much, just calling in after a while, haven't been able to really listen to the show live, but...
3991021	3994782	Finally got to sit down and talk to you guys again.
3995182	3995762	Well, what's up?
3995822	3997623	Was there a story tonight you wanted to comment on?
4000144	4004685	I did play the Kentucky Fried Cruelty Chicken game.
4005305	4006105	It was pretty good.
4006485	4013307	It's definitely better than a lot of charity organizations putting up web games on there.
4013868	4015008	It was fun and stuff.
4015852	4022894	It was certainly better than most politically-oriented games, and even better than a lot of homebrew, which... Oh, I can't believe... I'm so sorry, ParadoxVincent.
4022914	4024054	I've got to go on a tangent for a minute.
4024074	4024595	I know, it's fine.
4024615	4031877	Did you hear about the homebrew that was on the DS that was like, avoid the gay mob, or whatever it is?
4032297	4032877	No.
4033257	4039799	You control the little character, and then if you get hit by the mob, it goes, oh, you got hit by a gay person, game over.
4039859	4040299	And it's huge.
4040399	4042940	It's been hitting all these websites.
4043360	4046222	because it's like, oh my gosh, homophobia in the homebrew scene.
4046603	4050005	Well, and I just kind of read it going, you know, well, there's idiots everywhere.
4050145	4057210	And the unfortunate thing is, is that when you give this guy attention, unfortunately, more people are going to seek this game out and play it.
4057651	4065036	Not just people who like, you know, gay guys who want to play it and laugh at it for being stupid, which, you know, I admit I was tempted to do, but I didn't.
4065316	4071561	But then you're also going to have people that inadvertently read about this through sites like, you know, MTV or whatever, that report on it going, you know,
4072193	4074855	Yeah, I do kind of, you know, I do hate gays.
4074895	4080258	I want to play this game and I want to find this guy who made this game and help him make a better game, you know, and just, I don't know.
4080598	4083800	I don't think we should give these kinds of things any attention whatsoever.
4084641	4088443	So maybe I shouldn't have said anything about it at all, but I just thought the whole thing was very interesting.
4088583	4090084	And the homebrew was really bad.
4090385	4091105	It's really bad.
4091565	4092386	Anyway, sorry, Paradox.
4092406	4093106	Really bad homebrew?
4093126	4094287	Yeah, it's really bad.
4094587	4096608	So, okay, back to the PETA game.
4096668	4098470	What do you think was their motivations for making it?
4100411	4100451	Um...
4101676	4114160	You know, it's either what you said in trying to kind of target the video game playing audience and tell them, hey, you know, Kentucky Fried Chicken is bad.
4114801	4126305	Or really, they could have just been seeking out a new media to get their message out and then they noticed that, you know, web games are pretty popular.
4126965	4127105	So...
4128857	4129858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4157364	4163468	Why, why did they, I mean, if they chose to do this to do, to connect with a gaming audience, it kind of worked, didn't it?
4163889	4171914	Because, like, you know, all the major gaming blogs reported on it, and I probably would have never heard of this game had it not been posted, you know, like all these different blogs are on the internet.
4171934	4175317	So, in a way, it kind of worked, and it kind of did get their message out there, huh?
4175457	4175917	Here's the thing.
4176698	4177298	Real quick, sorry.
4178726	4181508	It got the attention because it's on all these game blogs.
4181929	4184671	You know they're going to get a cease and desist for this.
4185131	4187132	That's going to be even more attention for them.
4187532	4188193	I don't think they will.
4188553	4189033	I think they will.
4189634	4190214	All right, we'll see.
4191935	4192416	I wouldn't know.
4193276	4194637	All right.
4194757	4197299	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Paradox Vincent?
4198300	4200581	Yes, two things, and I'll try to get them done real quick.
4200601	4203123	Quick Guitar Hero 80s review.
4203824	4204804	Great song list.
4205004	4207246	I love almost every song in there.
4207659	4215965	and it gave me a couple new favorite songs, but they're just really kind of not great charts.
4216765	4229233	Especially the Turning Japanese chart was really boring, but I guess it's Activision's first real take at a music game, to my understanding, and hopefully they'll be getting better by the time Guitar Hero 3 comes out.
4231895	4234297	I mean, this is Harmonix's third game
4235050	4238051	Guitar Hero was, so they already knew what they were doing a lot.
4238652	4257499	And also, I don't know if anybody's heard, but there is a 2DX gold machine in Arizona right now as of probably about a month and a half ago, and it's at Mesa Golf Land, Sunsplash, and the one-player turntable right now, though, is broke or stolen or something, as I know.
4257559	4258360	I would have never guessed.
4260549	4260749	Yep.
4260929	4263452	Because Mesa Golf Land is just like Roseville Golf Land.
4263512	4267555	I mean, it's huge, and it has, like, the water park, if I remember right, and everything, so.
4268096	4268276	Yep.
4268616	4268776	Yep.
4270098	4272560	And they might be getting a poppin' music machine.
4272600	4273160	That would be cool.
4273221	4273941	Poppin' music's awesome.
4273961	4275142	They just said might.
4276303	4277184	I'm hoping they will, though.
4277424	4278345	So, that's really all.
4278385	4279466	All right.
4279786	4281028	Well, thanks so much for the call.
4281448	4282509	Appreciate it, Paradox Vincent.
4282529	4283330	You have a great week, okay?
4283350	4284531	All right.
4284571	4285071	You guys, too.
4285091	4285452	All right.
4285492	4285692	Later.
4286673	4287013	See you later.
4287549	4290110	Have lots of fun playing the 2DX Gold Machine, that's for sure.
4290130	4294611	You know what's funny, though, is I think the PD game worked in reverse for me, because I forgot about, you know, KFC.
4294651	4298032	You know, they kind of fell off my radar as far as food options.
4298072	4300673	I'm like, you know, hey, KFC sounds kind of good right now.
4300693	4302653	I was sort of thinking about getting fried chicken on the way home.
4302733	4303414	You guys.
4305114	4306054	I'm a southern girl.
4306114	4307695	I grew up on fried chicken and grits.
4308211	4310292	Here's one thing I do love about KFC.
4310312	4311753	Biscuits.
4311953	4312873	No, no, no, no.
4312893	4314514	Most of them have A&Ws attached to them.
4314534	4314954	Biscuits.
4315034	4317895	An A&W root beer is the bomb when it comes out of the tap.
4318195	4318675	Biscuits.
4319036	4319856	There was one time.
4319876	4320656	Biscuits and honey.
4320756	4321497	All right, biscuits.
4321537	4321897	We get it.
4321917	4324678	There was one time I passed it up, and I really wanted to do it.
4324898	4328339	They were selling root beer in gallon jugs, like the milk jugs.
4328479	4328960	They were.
4329000	4329780	I remember that.
4330500	4331201	That's good shit.
4331221	4333722	They were big things in their root beer right out of the tap.
4334262	4334462	Wow.
4334482	4334542	Wow.
4335029	4337590	and Julie and I got three of them and drank them in a night.
4337631	4338431	It was fantastic.
4339211	4340052	It was Diet Rebirth for them.
4340072	4342413	Quick comments from the recent phone call there.
4342453	4343274	We are still live.
4343314	4345435	It's been 25 minutes since the maintenance was supposed to start.
4345475	4346015	We're still up.
4346635	4349377	God damn life is screwing us all up.
4349437	4349697	Oh well.
4350217	4352198	Did they put any sort of retraction notices or anything?
4352399	4352779	I don't know.
4352819	4353659	I'm not even going to bother to look.
4353679	4354160	No, they were smart.
4354200	4362164	They would just say that they're taking the service offline for a while to protest the whole, you know, that law going into place even though they were doing maintenance.
4363872	4368007	Don't even get me started You know, I don't see anything about it Let me see
4368669	4369829	I'm going to check this out.
4369869	4372670	Meanwhile, RawSteelUT says, Rob, it didn't work.
4372710	4373890	We're still going to eat KFC.
4374310	4380832	I don't know, but if a couple people change their mind, maybe some people would tell you it was worth it.
4381132	4388054	And I showed it to another friend of mine, and another friend of mine played it and said, oh, wow, you know, I don't want KFC anymore.
4388074	4391434	The only thing I'm pissed off about KFC is they got rid of their chicken livers.
4391515	4393435	I used to love those things, and they used to have –
4393795	4397497	They used to have, I think, some sweet and sour sauce, and I think they got rid of that stuff, too.
4397637	4399758	I love their sweet and sour sauce.
4400639	4403560	Joshi16 says, I'm going to order fried chicken right now to protest.
4404561	4406221	I used to get their chicken livers all the time.
4406241	4408162	They came in a big bucket, and you'd get your gravy with it.
4408262	4409483	Oh, my God, that was so good.
4410364	4412845	You need to have the chicken livers at Roscoe's, though.
4413745	4415886	All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show.
4415926	4418167	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4419408	4420529	Loki, we'll start off with you tonight.
4420549	4421169	Your final thoughts.
4422149	4425131	I get some Bioshock next week and that makes me happy.
4426552	4430955	My final thought is ow, tooth, hurt, hate, dentist, cry.
4432036	4432996	DarkSakura, your final thought.
4433176	4434818	I fucking want some chicken liver right now.
4435958	4438940	Alright, thanks you guys for tuning in and listening to us tonight.
4438980	4443603	Thank you to all the live listeners and sorry the maintenance didn't happen when it was supposed to happen.
4444224	4444864	Very interesting.
4445144	4450608	No, I'm surprised that PETA hasn't shut down our peep jousting
4451443	4453596	tournaments that we do once in a while because, you know.
