15460	19780	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19780	23660	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August
23660	28940	19th, 2007, for part B of episode number 243 of our podcast.
28940	31500	Yes, we've been doing this a little while.
31500	34380	Of course on our show, if you're brand new to our program, we like to discuss the latest
34380	38780	in video games and gaming culture and, you know, we're three gamers that all met playing
38780	43760	DDR at an arcade and we've known each other for about five years doing this program and
43760	44760	just kind of like to give our share.
44760	47340	And of course it's all about what you guys have to say as well and you can always interact
47340	52400	with our program through the chat room or through our Skype line or, you know, our voicemail
52400	53400	or mailbag.
53400	57260	You can always send us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com because if we can do
57260	60220	a show, if any old idiots like us can do a show, then you guys should be able to be a
60220	61440	part of it as well.
61440	63260	So anyhow, let's get back into the gaming news.
63260	66300	Started off with some talk about Mario Kart coming out on the Wii.
66300	70460	There's some brand new details about Mario Kart on the Wii.
70460	74220	Apparently a couple of screenshots, new screenshots actually hit the internet this week and so
74220	76780	it gives some more details about what's going on.
76780	81300	Of course the tracks appear to be bigger and better as you would expect on a new console.
81300	83000	You can do jumps, little jumps again.
83000	84260	The jump button is back.
84260	89940	Twelve player racing online, shortcuts within the tracks as well, mid-air stunts apparently
89940	94020	can be done in the game as well, and tracks being carried over from Mario Kart Double
94020	99440	Dash which is cool because some of the classic tracks of course have awesome design in them.
99440	103100	So I'd like to see the old school Rainbow Road come back one more time because I wasn't
103100	106540	as big of a fan of the new school Rainbow Road since the old one.
106540	110620	Mario Kart 64 I think was probably one of the best.
110620	111620	I love Mario Kart 64.
111620	115780	That's one of the few Nintendo 64 games I really, really adore which by the way I forgot
115780	120020	to say in part A during my gaming week, I played F-Zero 64.
120020	121020	I didn't care for it.
121020	122860	I know Jamie you said you loved that one.
122860	123860	I didn't really care for it.
123860	129900	I do see though now where a lot of like GX, the GameCube one came from because it totally
129900	136720	feels like an earlier version of F-Zero GX but I thought Mario Kart 64 was a way better
136720	141180	racer on the Nintendo 64 than F-Zero sadly.
141180	145620	Which makes me sad because I love my F-Zero but oh well.
145620	151180	Anyhow, anyways some interesting news in the homebrew scene on the Wii.
151180	155700	Apparently if you have a mod chipped Wii, they have just enabled it to be able to play
155700	162540	DVDs as if you really need to do that but in case you're interested, what you can do
162540	169860	is actually using a I guess clone CD like some special boot CD that you create.
169860	177940	You'll boot it with your Wii that's got, I guess it's a mod that's programmed in YO Assembly
177940	183940	1.8 and I guess they use this program called Wii Boss and then what you do is you just
183940	187820	mount the disc and pop in the DVD.
187820	193420	So you get to play it using the Wii Remote of course as the remote for it.
193420	196220	I don't know, it's kind of gimmicky, kind of cool.
196220	200140	Definitely something that they can implement later on since it looks like the Wii is fully
200140	203540	capable of course playing DVD movies.
203540	207020	There has to be some sort of functionality already built in that they're going to release
207020	209100	something for later.
209100	210960	Seems so weird how Nintendo does that.
210960	213460	They love to do these time release things on their consoles.
213460	217740	Like you know DS, surprise it goes online, surprise it has voice chat, surprise.
217740	218740	It's just interesting.
218740	221900	Nintendo has some very interesting strategies sometimes.
221900	227260	Well I think that as a company they're very far seen.
227260	233020	They look at the big picture, they have a vision and stick to it.
233020	239740	Well there was speculation on this article by Gizmodo, they were saying that possibly
239740	244740	later on since the whole issue was DVD licensing fees, I guess the license, the technology
244740	251060	to play back DVD video, obviously they didn't want to increase the cost of the Wii so which
251060	256940	you could possibly do later on is get a DVD channel for your Wii downloaded off of Wiiware
256940	261620	and then you pay the money for the licensing fee up front, there you go, pop that in and
261620	262620	you can play DVDs.
262620	266620	Well AZHP brings up an interesting point in our chat room.
266620	269900	There can't be anything already in the Wii that can play DVDs because they need to buy
269900	272340	the licensing to include that software.
272340	277140	It's not legal for them to add in DVD compatibility and time release it.
277140	278940	Interesting.
278940	284460	The son and dad said the Dreamcast was going to have DVD playback but it never happened.
284460	291020	I still don't think there's any problem because really the DVD, the audio and video, really
291020	295380	that's just a particular file and if the Wii is already set up to read those types of files
295380	302380	then having specific DVD playability in the Wii is not the issue.
302380	304100	It was not made with that intent.
304100	306940	It would just be able to read those files already.
306940	310220	It needs the software, I think.
310220	316060	RossDielUT says what a thinly veiled attempt to justify pirate mod chips since hey it plays
316060	317060	DVDs.
317060	320340	Oh and by the way you can play copied games.
320340	321340	Interesting thought.
321340	326980	Nintendo's always, well this whole thing that surprised me about modding the Wii and about
326980	332620	their import policy with it is that they never I guess really cared that much in the past
332620	338620	given that in every other system except the GameCube it was all a physical lockout.
338620	344940	At least with the TurboGrafx it was a difference in the pin sets on the HuCards.
344940	346800	There was no real good converter.
346800	348940	I have the one that was supposed to be the best.
348940	349940	It doesn't work.
349940	356540	Except with the CD games there was no country coding but there were still new CD games but
356540	362580	I don't see exactly why they're as all up in arms on this when Sony's like hey you
362580	367780	can play them here.
367780	373580	It's kind of an old debate at this point for me but you know I think everything should
373580	374580	be region free.
374580	378600	I don't understand the intent to region lock things especially I mean I can understand
378600	381840	because the DVD licensing you have to region lock things but with the Wii if you don't
381840	383820	have DVD playback you don't need to region lock things.
383820	387020	I don't think you have to region lock everything with DVDs and stuff.
387020	388020	Look at the...
388020	389020	Unless it's porn.
389020	395660	PlayStation 3, granted it's Blu-ray but that's region free, the PSP is region free, DS is
395660	400020	region free, Game Boy Advance is region free.
400020	401420	I don't see what the point is.
401420	405660	If anything you're going to be selling more copies of games because people are going to
405660	409300	buy like say Oh and Done and then buy Elite Beat Agents.
409300	411300	Hey you sold an extra copy in Japan.
411300	413640	Who cares if they paid money to have it shipped over here.
413640	415200	That's their money.
415200	417340	But you sold an extra copy because of that.
417340	419060	Is that really a bad thing?
419060	422300	And then we're going to get a Ninja Pass but that's another story.
422300	424460	Jay that says Nintendo is a toy company.
424460	427180	They produce toys not DVD players.
427180	432680	GS68 says because if you buy the Japanese version of a game that has a North American
432680	436420	version it could cause problems with your region's market.
436420	437420	Interesting.
437420	444340	All right well if you want to chat with us join our chat room chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com
444340	446340	and give us your two cents.
446340	454540	Well for anybody who is you know still keeping up with anything about the Virtual Console
454540	458060	and the Wii I do have the update for the UK.
458060	463820	As you were saying previously Wave Race 64 is out for a thousand points.
463820	468540	It translated to seven pounds, ten euro.
468540	472660	And well it's Wave Race which I didn't really care for.
472660	481780	We also have Crater Maze from the Turbo Graphics 16, 600 Wii points, 420 pounds, six euro.
481780	484200	And I think that's it.
484200	487900	Some new additions for you folks that like to play the Virtual Console in the UK and
487900	491020	of course we know here in America we get Super Metroid on Monday.
491020	492020	Not sure what else we get with that.
492020	494460	Crater Maze is a weird game.
494460	499080	There's a lot of weird Turbo Graphics games available on the Wii now and Genesis games
499080	501240	as well.
501240	504860	And some weird games coming out for the Playstation 2 very soon.
504860	509620	A brand new accessory is coming out for the Playstation 2 and In2Games is supposed to be
509620	512500	revealing this at the games convention in Leipzig.
512500	514940	It's a Wiimote basically for the Playstation 2.
514940	516140	I probably shouldn't call it that.
516140	519600	It's a motion sensing pad for the Playstation 2.
519600	524180	The games that are going to be coming out for it, Real Play Tennis, Real Play Pool,
524180	529180	Real Play Golf, Real Play Racing, Real Play Bowling, and Real Play Puzzle Spear.
529180	532540	Hmm, I've heard of some of these games before.
532540	536800	The little sensing pad is supposed to emulate tennis rackets, pool cues, golf clubs and
536800	539500	steering wheels amongst others.
539500	540900	Hmm.
540900	543340	I heard a voice of disagreement over there, Loki.
543340	544620	What do you think?
544620	545620	It's gimmicky shit.
545620	547260	That's what it is.
547260	551120	I've seen the pictures of them and it's not what you think.
551120	553580	It's not a game pad per se.
553580	555000	It's not like the Wii Remote.
555000	558100	It actually is something that looks like a tennis racket.
558100	559420	Something that looks like a golf club.
559420	560420	Something that looks like a bowling ball.
560420	562860	And it just has motion sensors in those.
562860	570300	So think, if you will, there was a golf game that came out called, I want to say, Real
570300	574660	Motion Golf or something like that on Playstation 2 and Xbox a while back.
574660	577220	And I don't know.
577220	578980	It's gimmicky shit.
578980	584060	Well, on the other hand, I can't help but feel like I've played these games before.
584060	587340	And when games start feeling unoriginal, I don't know about you guys, but I get a little
587340	588340	bit angsty.
588340	590340	Do you guys get a little bit angsty?
590340	591340	All the time.
591340	596180	That means it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.
596180	609220	Jamie, why don't you start us off?
609220	616060	FU to headaches that develop into nosebleeds.
616060	617060	That's no fun.
617060	618060	No, it's not.
618060	620180	Is that it?
620180	624220	And also an FU to nosebleeds while I'm busy drinking.
624220	625220	Loki.
625220	630740	FU to pompous little jerks that think they can drive their truck around like it's a fucking
630740	632940	race car.
632940	633940	Actually this is funny.
633940	637700	We saw this last night when we were at the movie theater, this dumb ass blowing through
637700	642720	tons of stop signs in the parking lot, driving like 50 miles an hour.
642720	647020	And you know, usually it's like, where the fuck are the cops when you need them?
647020	649340	There just happened to be a cop right when you needed him.
649340	650980	Pulled the bastard over.
650980	652020	It was awesome.
652020	654460	I laughed my ass off.
654460	655460	Good times.
655460	657620	Justice is served.
657620	662380	My FU goes to this weird cavity thing I have in my mouth.
662380	666020	It's not like a tooth cavity, but I think like one of my crowns is coming off or something
666020	669740	and now it's like a cavity and it sucks because it hurts and now I have to go to the dentist
669740	674820	and I hate going to the dentist because I, oh God, the dentist makes you feel so stupid.
674820	677100	I don't know about you guys, but I hate my dentist.
677100	678580	So I hate every single one.
678580	680900	I think it's only been like one dentist I've ever gone to that I ever liked.
680900	681900	He should go to my dentist.
681900	682900	He's very great.
682900	683900	He probably doesn't take my insurance.
683900	688740	FU to my dentist insurance, not letting me go to very many dentists, but I always fall
688740	689740	asleep.
689740	690740	Let's see.
690740	691740	Just FU to the dentist in general.
691740	695460	Not my favorite thing to do.
695460	696460	Okay.
696460	697460	Just kind of following up with the story here.
697460	701060	I know this is really bad radio, but this is what they are.
701060	707700	Those are the controllers for those crappy attachments that they came out with for the
707700	708700	Wii.
708700	709700	That's the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
709700	710700	Except they're not.
710700	713260	They just have like little sensors and shit on them.
713260	718500	So yeah, it's not a whole lot to get excited about, but hey, I mean if you're into that
718500	722460	kind of stuff and you don't want to go out and buy an actual Wii system and you want
722460	724900	to be able to bowl at home and stuff, great.
724900	725900	Buy the game.
725900	727480	It's only like 30 bucks anyway.
727480	734080	So it's not really a Wiimote coming to the PlayStation 2, but it's these Wii-like technologies
734080	735660	coming to the PlayStation 2.
735660	739460	Something like that, yeah.
739460	745940	Now what's also interesting, this kind of leaked out during an online demo for, I believe
745940	751420	it was for another game, during Unreal Tournament 3, they had accidentally paused the game or
751420	757060	something and a gamer card screen popped up that's going to be tied in with home.
757060	762400	And apparently, you know, the PlayStation Network will be getting a similar type of
762400	771480	thing with their home service and my guess is going to be very similar to what Xbox has
771480	774220	right now with their live service.
774220	779100	What's interesting though is, you know, gamer card might sound familiar seeing as there's
779100	789300	that whole my gamer card thing as part of Xbox, so, I don't know, great.
789300	793860	Well, I mean, if it's not broken, why fix it?
793860	798220	It's not the most original idea, but it's good that they're getting something else,
798220	799220	I guess.
799220	802060	Joe, she's 16, says, Sony innovating again.
802060	803060	Brilliant.
803060	804060	Innovation.
804060	805060	Yeah, that's the key word.
805060	806060	All right.
806060	807860	Well, if you guys want to comment on this, we're actually going to open our Skype line
807860	809020	a little bit early tonight.
809020	812900	If you weren't listening to part A, unfortunately, the live stream is getting shut off at 8 p.m.
812900	814940	or so we're being told for some maintenance.
814940	818140	So to make sure that our live listeners get a chance to interact with us tonight before
818140	822580	the plug is pulled on the live stream and we have to finish the show with no live interaction,
822580	823760	we want to open up our Skype line.
823760	836340	So please head on over and give us a call, 1-866-GAME-OLR, I'm sorry, it's 1-866 or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
836340	837340	Get it right, Rob.
837340	844860	Go ahead after this amount of time, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio
844860	848380	on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
848380	852460	So just waiting for a call to come in and we'll take it.
852460	854380	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
854380	855380	Who's this?
855380	856380	Ravenstaufen.
856380	857380	How are you tonight, Sky?
857380	858380	Hi.
858380	859380	Fine.
859380	860380	What's up, Ravenstaufen?
860380	861380	What's on your mind?
861380	862380	Bioshock is on my mind.
862380	863900	God, you've got the quickest dialing finger in the world.
863900	865400	You're always the first one to get through.
865400	866400	It's amazing.
866400	867400	I do.
867400	868460	I know how to work Skype.
868460	871940	I think it's the new version of Skype or something because it shuts everyone else out once one
871940	873500	person's coming through.
873500	875180	I wish I could go back to the old version.
875180	876900	Anyway, what's on your mind?
876900	877900	Bioshock.
877900	884540	Yeah, but I want to ask you that the mini-game, the hacking mini-game, are you good at that
884540	885540	game?
885540	888620	Rob, you said you didn't do it, didn't you?
888620	891980	I wasn't able to complete it, but I only tried it one time.
891980	892980	It's Pipe Dream.
892980	897260	I think that's what it was, Pipe Dream, or that game on PopCap Games with the little
897260	898260	Chinese fireworks.
898260	900580	I don't remember the name of that game, but it reminded me of both those games.
900580	901700	Yeah, it's real easy.
901700	903420	Here's my trick in the whole thing.
903420	906220	You just flip over all the tiles if you can.
906220	907620	Dude, that's my trick.
907620	909980	Yeah, connect them.
909980	911660	Why wouldn't you want to flip over all the tiles?
911660	912660	I don't know.
912660	913660	Is there a downside to flipping over?
913660	914660	You pay money.
914660	915660	Not that I found out.
915660	916660	You pay money?
916660	918780	Yeah, you know, it's either hacking or pay money.
918780	919780	Oh.
919780	920780	Oh, well, no.
920780	923100	When you're flipping over the tiles, you don't pay money.
923100	924100	No, no, no.
924100	927060	If you lose, then your health goes bad.
927060	931500	You can pay money to just have it automatically hack, or you can do the tile thing, but yeah,
931500	934100	I don't understand why you wouldn't flip over all the tiles.
934100	938260	Yeah, because some people I talk to go like, the game's hard.
938260	939260	This is really hard.
939260	943980	You're supposed to flip over every tile and try to figure out shit.
943980	947020	That seems to kind of defeat the purpose if you just go in there and flip over every tile.
947020	950700	There are some other tiles, though, that are in the actual game.
950700	955020	I'm not sure why, if there's a downside to flipping over tiles.
955020	958260	Maybe that's one of the differences where the demo and the real game are a little different.
958260	960460	I'll have to ask someone I know that already owns the game.
960460	962980	Well, what did you want to say about the hacking, Raven's Dolphin?
962980	968220	Well, you know, yesterday I showed how I can be very good at the hacking.
968220	972260	I showed everyone that I can get it done quite quickly, and they went like, oh, it's very
972260	973260	hard.
973260	975820	I went like, it's not hard, and I showed them that it's not hard.
975820	979380	And what did they do, were they calling you names because you just flipped over every
979380	980380	tile?
980380	981380	That was your trick, or what?
981380	985260	No, they just went like, I can never get through the hacking, like the little mini-game.
985260	987020	I'm like, I'm going to show you how to get through it.
987020	989980	Well, I believe in the full version of the game you're supposed to be able to hack the
989980	990980	vending machines.
990980	992540	There's other stuff you can hack, too.
992540	994740	Yeah, there's other things that hack in the game.
994740	995740	Can't wait for it, though.
995740	997340	Yeah, are you excited about Bioshock?
997340	1001780	Yeah, but the thing about, there's an interesting story about this game for me.
1001780	1004540	I can't remember pre-ordering it at all.
1004540	1009100	And EB says I have a pre-order for it, so someone must like me.
1009100	1012140	You think somebody went in there and put a pre-order down for you?
1012140	1013140	I don't know.
1013140	1017020	I just can't remember for the life of me why I have a pre-order for it.
1017020	1019940	All right, well, one more thing, Rayman's Dolphin?
1019940	1022300	Yeah, there was one more thing.
1022300	1027980	When you, this is about Bioshock, when you first saw Rapture, would your jaw on the floor,
1027980	1030180	like that can't be right?
1030180	1034660	Like when you first go down into the city of, the city?
1034660	1039820	Yeah, when you see the crab and then you see the beautiful city, did your jaw just go,
1039820	1041980	oh my god?
1041980	1042980	Kind of.
1042980	1046260	I was already, like, just in that very first scene where you're in the ocean with all the
1046260	1049180	fire everywhere, kind of like how Loki said at the beginning of the show, like some people
1049180	1050540	just turn around and look at the fire for them.
1050540	1051700	It'll make a good movie.
1051700	1055740	That was more, that's what I was thinking, is that, like, it's totally set up like a
1055740	1056740	movie.
1056740	1060980	That's what gets, that is what has a lot of people really sucked into this game, is they've
1060980	1065500	really pulled it off, making it just like a movie, and 2K to some extent did this with
1065500	1069380	their last game, Prey, which I actually talked about on this program a lot, and it was actually
1069380	1073980	a first person shooter I really liked, was Prey, because it was set up for dummies like
1073980	1074980	me.
1074980	1075980	You could never die in Prey.
1075980	1077260	I loved it.
1077260	1082020	For the hardcore FPS fan, they hated it, but it was also set up very much like a movie,
1082020	1084960	but I don't know, Bioshock pulls it off in a different way that's much more engrossing
1084960	1086860	than even Prey.
1086860	1087860	One last thing.
1087860	1088860	Of course.
1088860	1089860	Next gen flushing.
1089860	1092980	I enjoyed flushing the toilet and see it actually going down.
1092980	1095140	Which way did it spin?
1095140	1096140	Which way did it flush?
1096140	1097140	Dr. Clockwise.
1097140	1098140	Oh.
1098140	1101820	That's a good question, because it is the bottom of the ocean, so the question, because
1101820	1104780	this city is supposed to exist at the bottom of the ocean, so the question is, does it
1104780	1105780	spin a different way?
1105780	1106780	But what part of the world was it in?
1106780	1107780	I don't know.
1107780	1112820	I complained, I said that, you know, now we have next gen flushing, and this is next generation.
1112820	1113820	Flushing and water.
1113820	1116260	You could flush the toilet in Duke Nukem 3D.
1116260	1118620	You could flush the toilets in Final Fantasy VI.
1118620	1120340	But not like this.
1120340	1122780	You can't just go up to it and just flush it.
1122780	1127940	If you go in the bathroom in the palace, you can kneel on the toilet.
1127940	1129780	I guess that's the problem.
1129780	1132140	And you move off of it and it flushes.
1132140	1133140	Really?
1133140	1135060	So do all the boys sit when they pee?
1135060	1136940	It's everybody kneels on the toilet.
1136940	1140380	But you can also flush them in Animal Crossing too if you sit on them like a child.
1140380	1142820	You guys are very bored.
1142820	1146420	You know, I have to say, that certainly lets you know that the creators of the game have
1146420	1151740	gotten it down to every last freaking detail when the toilet flushes and everything.
1151740	1155500	The fact that you can run around and eat all the food and smoke all the cigarettes, and
1155500	1157860	apparently you can also play the guitars in the game.
1157860	1162660	Holy Shonen in chat says, LOL, the ideal of next gen flushing toilets.
1162660	1166260	Gold Banjo says, OMG, how far technology has taken us.
1166260	1167460	It's exciting.
1167460	1170620	I'm feeling very confident about future gaming.
1170620	1172200	I was just shocked as well.
1172200	1173200	Just flushing that toilet.
1173200	1174200	Like, this is it.
1174200	1175200	This is next gen.
1175200	1176200	All right.
1176200	1179060	Well, we're going to let you go for the future so you can go get your copy of Bioshock and
1179060	1180060	flush all the toilets.
1180060	1181060	Okay.
1181060	1182060	All right.
1182060	1183060	Bye.
1183060	1184060	Have a good one.
1184060	1185060	Bye.
1185060	1186060	I'm sorry.
1186060	1187060	Next gen has not started until I can take a splicer and give them a swirly in the toilet.
1187060	1188060	New call.
1188060	1189060	Hi.
1189060	1190060	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
1190060	1191060	Who's this?
1191060	1192060	Hi.
1192060	1193500	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
1193500	1194500	Who's this?
1194500	1195500	Hi.
1195500	1196500	It's ADHP.
1196500	1197500	Hello.
1197500	1198500	There you are.
1198500	1199500	What's on your mind, buddy?
1199500	1206340	Oh, well, I remember last show when you guys said that you didn't think Take-Two or Rockstar
1206340	1210340	was doing that badly because they're the makers of Grand Theft Auto.
1210340	1211340	Yeah.
1211340	1212340	Yeah.
1212340	1217820	Actually, they've been doing a lot of restructuring because they have really bad money management
1217820	1220300	because of the whole hot coffee incident.
1220300	1222440	They poured millions of dollars down that.
1222440	1223940	They're actually way down.
1223940	1227900	Yeah, and especially the fact that they don't really have anything new coming out this year
1227900	1230780	now also kind of has to hurt them a little bit.
1230780	1232540	Yeah, definitely.
1232540	1234820	So yeah.
1234820	1237340	Is that all you want to comment on or is there other stuff tonight?
1237340	1239980	Well, I don't know.
1239980	1244860	I didn't really get into the feed until after part B and part B wasn't that long.
1244860	1245860	Oh, all right.
1245860	1249420	Well, I know because we have to make sure we get the Skype in before eight o'clock tonight,
1249420	1252220	but our podcast will still have everything in it, all the stories and everything.
1252220	1254060	Well, what games have you been playing this week?
1254060	1257460	I've been playing a lot of Half-Life 2, actually.
1257460	1258460	Yeah.
1258460	1261740	Because I just got a new computer and I got this headset just so I could Skype in and
1261740	1262740	call you guys.
1262740	1263740	Awesome.
1263740	1264740	Cool.
1264740	1265740	Thank you.
1265740	1266740	Yeah.
1266740	1268940	So wait, you brought a brand new computer, so is it like a top of the line or is it like
1268940	1271420	a Costco computer or what?
1271420	1272500	It's kind of a budget computer.
1272500	1274260	It's like a Dell 600 bucks.
1274260	1278380	I was like, eh, I want something that plays games, but I don't want something that will
1278380	1279380	kill my wallet.
1279380	1281780	So you probably won't be playing Bioshock on it.
1281780	1283980	Ah, man, I wish I could.
1283980	1286340	Do you have a 360?
1286340	1289420	No, I just have a Wii for now.
1289420	1295980	I'm not getting into the next gen until they fix the stability issues on the Xbox 360.
1295980	1300020	You know, actually, Ross Steele kind of brings up a follow-up point in the chat room.
1300020	1304540	Ross Steele, UT, says, as far as take two, because 2K is a part of that, and says they
1304540	1309460	almost have nothing other than GTA, Bioshock might be their first post-GTA hit.
1309460	1312700	So maybe they do have a game this year that's going to bring in the money.
1312700	1315300	I thought it was 2K that was doing Bioshock.
1315300	1319260	It is 2K that's doing Bioshock, but don't they all roll up in take two?
1319260	1321780	Take two owns 2K, and they also own Rockstar.
1321780	1324660	Yeah, so it's just different subsidiaries of take two.
1324660	1325660	I see.
1325660	1326660	Interesting.
1326660	1332540	Yeah, I just wanted to, like, every time a great game comes out for the Xbox 360, I'm
1332540	1335020	like, man, I wish I had an Xbox 360.
1335020	1339640	And then I get, you know, hear stories of like, oh man, my Xbox 360 broke just before
1339640	1340640	this game came out.
1340640	1341640	What am I going to do?
1341640	1344340	And I'm like, I don't want to get that anymore.
1344340	1348580	Well, at least they have the warranty thing, so it's, you know, a little better now.
1348580	1351180	All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
1351180	1352700	No, that's about it.
1352700	1353700	All right.
1353700	1355260	Well, thank you so much for calling, and have a good week, okay?
1355260	1356260	Yeah, you too.
1356260	1357260	Thanks.
1357260	1358260	Have fun with the new computer.
1358260	1359260	All right, bye.
1359260	1360260	Bye-bye.
1360260	1362420	I wonder if he'll be playing World of Warcraft on that computer, because there's a lot of
1362420	1365180	people who go out and get those budget computers to play World of Warcraft.
1365180	1366180	We'll see.
1366180	1367180	We'll take a couple more calls.
1367180	1371100	If you'd like to give us a call again, the number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1371100	1373900	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
1373900	1376140	But don't call now, because we have another call on the line right now.
1376140	1378140	Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
1378140	1379420	Hey, guys, what's up?
1379420	1380420	It's Footy Monster.
1380420	1381420	Hello, Footy Monster.
1381420	1382420	What's on your mind?
1382420	1383420	Nothing much.
1383420	1387220	I actually want to share with you guys something that I learned during the past day, which
1387220	1391900	is the Hannah Montana game for the DS actually seems to be really good.
1391900	1392900	What is this?
1392900	1395380	Hannah Montana, you know, that Disney show?
1395380	1396620	Wait, wait, wait.
1396620	1399220	Hannah Montana for the DS is good?
1399220	1400220	Yes.
1400220	1401220	This is newsworthy.
1401220	1404780	It's a platform that's out already, but the one is going to come out soon.
1404780	1407340	Now, how do you know this?
1407340	1412860	Because I checked the video that was posted on DS Fanboy on Friday, and basically the
1412860	1418220	game is like jam sessions for the DS, where you have the guitar, you can strum it and
1418220	1422900	play chords and stuff, but takes you to the next level where you can not only strum, but
1422900	1428100	also pick individual strings, and also you get a full drum kit in which you can actually
1428100	1432940	play like everything on the drum, and a bass guitar, and also you have connectivity with
1432940	1434740	other DSs, and you can play on Wi-Fi.
1434740	1437220	Each person takes an instrument, you can jam together, actually.
1437220	1439620	The chat room is all surprised that you're serious.
1439620	1441980	I'm serious, completely serious.
1441980	1448100	It looks like Rock Band meets jam sessions with a really bad IP sticking on the front.
1448100	1449100	I see.
1449100	1452460	So Hannah Montana is a music game that looks to be really good, basically.
1452460	1453460	Yeah, yeah.
1453460	1454460	It's a music game, yeah.
1454460	1457540	So it's not good because I don't get to punch her in the face or anything.
1457540	1458540	That's not what makes it good, right?
1458540	1459540	Yeah, nothing helps.
1459540	1460540	It's actually a good game.
1460540	1461540	Wow.
1461540	1463180	It seems to be a good game.
1463180	1469780	I actually called to Bobby Blackpool's show before, and he said that he thinks, or that
1469780	1475220	he heard, that they might re-release without the IP, like the Hannah Montana IP slapping
1475220	1477140	to it, like the developers.
1477140	1479500	That would be hilarious if they did that.
1479500	1483140	Can you guys think of any other games that were like that, that were actually pretty
1483140	1487260	good games that just had a crappy brand on it?
1487260	1488540	I'm trying to think if there's anything else.
1488540	1490820	I'm like, surely there was something else in gaming history.
1490820	1494820	Maybe the chat room can think of something like, was there a great concept for a game
1494820	1498580	or a great game that just got totally screwed by the IP that was attached to it?
1498580	1499580	Cool Spot.
1499580	1501820	Oh, Spot, the video game?
1501820	1502820	Yeah, Cool Spot.
1502820	1505220	Oh, like all the way back in the NES days?
1505220	1506220	Super NES.
1506220	1507860	Oh, I don't remember that one.
1507860	1510660	I remember the old board game one that was kind of like Othello.
1510660	1515260	Well, no, this is with the Spot from 7-Up.
1515260	1518060	There were the Noid games.
1518060	1519060	The Noid games?
1519060	1520060	Was any good?
1520060	1521060	You annoyed yourself.
1521060	1523460	They were a good waste of time.
1523460	1524460	Oh!
1524460	1525460	Vectorman.
1525460	1526460	Sneak King.
1526460	1527460	Hello.
1527460	1528460	We did have one recently.
1528460	1529460	But actually, I don't know.
1529460	1530460	The Burger King IP kind of made it, actually.
1530460	1531460	I don't know.
1531460	1532460	I wouldn't say that was a bad IP.
1532460	1533460	But, huh.
1533460	1537580	And now I'm just curious about if High School Musical 2, the game, is going to be coming
1537580	1538580	out any soon.
1538580	1539580	I still have Shane's CD.
1539580	1543940	Well, High School Musical, the game, just came out in DS last week, and it's coming
1543940	1548220	out, the karaoke games coming out on Playstation 2 and Wii in November.
1548220	1553580	All I have to do is go to Disneyland and then run away from them while they chase me.
1553580	1555500	So Footy Monster, I'm just shocked.
1555500	1558660	A very unlikely recommendation for Hannah Montana, but you know what?
1558660	1562740	I guess this will truly put people to the test.
1562740	1567140	Is a good game a good game a good game no matter what?
1567140	1573300	And if you remember, though, they do have that special Disney, like Xbox Live-type service
1573300	1576900	that's starting with the Hannah Montana 2 game, too.
1576900	1581980	I just posted the link to the story and the video in chat, so just check it out for yourselves.
1581980	1585380	I mean, really, it's like I can tell you Hannah Montana seems to be a good game and
1585380	1589340	you're probably going to laugh at me, but once you see that, I actually look at people's
1589340	1593380	reaction in the chat room before and it's like, I can't believe that he's right.
1593380	1595180	It looks to be pretty cool.
1595180	1598820	The fact that you can actually jam, like, if it was Rock Band, it's like people said
1598820	1603060	it's jam sessions for the DS mixed with Rock Band with a crap IP.
1603060	1605380	And how the fuck did Hannah Montana get her name on this?
1605380	1606380	That's what I want to know.
1606380	1610740	I'm looking at this right now, so wait, I'm going to play this little video here just
1610740	1611740	because I can.
1611740	1616100	And this is coming from DS Fanboy.
1616100	1617100	So where's this video?
1617100	1618900	Oh, it's going to stream a lot here.
1618900	1620060	Let me take a little bit.
1620060	1622780	It's not going to be good.
1622780	1627460	It's kind of stupid, like, I don't know why the person doesn't really show the game screen
1627460	1628460	that much.
1628460	1629460	They show the guy talking.
1629460	1630460	Yeah, I know.
1630460	1635900	I just want to see the screen, but they show the screen a couple of times and you can get
1635900	1637180	the feel of the game.
1637180	1642460	You can record up to two minutes, even if you're playing Wi-Fi, so you can actually
1642460	1648020	record two minutes of something if you're recording with your buddies and that kind
1648020	1649020	of thing.
1649020	1655020	So it seems to be pretty feature complete, which is kind of impressive.
1655020	1657740	Son of Dad says the license kills this game.
1657740	1660500	No hardcore gamer will buy this.
1660500	1663100	I will buy it.
1663100	1664100	You dare to defy.
1664100	1665100	What son of Dad?
1665100	1667460	Well, here's the best part, though.
1667460	1674180	If it's a game like this where it's not going to be that popular, it means it'll just be
1674180	1678060	in a bargain bin pretty quick and then you can pick it up.
1678060	1681780	But it might be popular because of the fact that, oh, he's like strumming the little guitar
1681780	1683780	with the DS thing.
1683780	1688660	You have actual strings and you can either pick the whole thing or just each string in
1688660	1692060	itself and use the feedback-selected ports.
1692060	1693060	Very interesting.
1693060	1695220	Talk about gaming gems in the strangest places.
1695220	1698660	I mean, wow, there's little drums, too.
1698660	1699660	That is something else.
1699660	1702420	I might have to check that out.
1702420	1706340	Real quickly before we let you go, I know you also co-host a podcast about strictly
1706340	1708480	role-playing games, right?
1708480	1709480	That is correct.
1709480	1710980	Am I allowed to plug it?
1710980	1712980	Yes, you may plug it.
1712980	1718500	All right, The Ultimate Quest, you can find it on UltimateQuest.net and the next show
1718500	1721740	is probably going to be released in the next few days, so yeah, there you go.
1721740	1725460	Well, what I want to ask you about Ultimate Quest, I know Blue Dragon is coming out very
1725460	1726460	soon.
1726460	1727460	Are you excited about this?
1727460	1729620	Because it's been getting some mixed reception from people.
1729620	1733140	I would be excited about it if it wasn't for two reasons.
1733140	1738420	First off, one of the other co-hosts on the show, Jack Ransom, Shadow Slayer, better known,
1738420	1744580	he actually played the demo and also did Xenocore, and they both agree that it's really nice
1744580	1748420	looking, it's something that 360 doesn't really have any access, which is like a traditional
1748420	1753660	RPG, but that's it.
1753660	1758140	So that the whole thing that they look really like little kids will put off any hardcore
1758140	1762260	360 game and things that don't have a 360, so whatever.
1762260	1763260	All right, we'll see.
1763260	1766540	All right, anyway, we've had John for a long time, so we got to let you go, but thanks
1766540	1769660	so much for the call and for the tip on Hannah Montana, who would have known?
1769660	1770660	Yeah, no worries.
1770660	1773380	I got to spread the Montana love with this whole thing.
1773380	1774380	Take care.
1774380	1775380	Have a good flight.
1775380	1776380	I understand you have a 14-hour flight tomorrow, so have a good flight.
1776380	1777380	All right.
1777380	1778380	Thanks a lot, man.
1778380	1779380	All right.
1779380	1780380	Bye-bye.
1780380	1781380	See you.
1781380	1782380	See you.
1782380	1783380	See you.
1783380	1784380	He's breaking up a little bit there at the end, too, so it's probably for the best.
1784380	1785380	We'll take one more call.
1785380	1786380	One more call.
1786380	1787380	Why not?
1787380	1792900	If anybody else decides to call in, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number, or our username on Skype
1792900	1795260	is OrangeLoungeRadio.
1795260	1796260	Waiting for it.
1796260	1797700	Oh, give it a second because of the buffer.
1797700	1801140	I'm trying to see what else is going on in chat here.
1801140	1802140	Let's see.
1802140	1807620	Joshi16 says he's pimping Montana out on the streets.
1807620	1812780	Footy is back in chat saying that game will rock everybody's socks.
1812780	1813780	Looks interesting, though.
1813780	1820100	They've got some good screenshots on IGN or something, and it's got a little too much
1820100	1823460	sparkles and pink for my taste, but I don't know.
1823460	1827260	I like that idea, though, that maybe the developers will release the game without the Hannah Montana
1827260	1829180	IP, like it's a different game.
1829180	1833380	Hitstun says you could say the GBA Astro Boy was brought down a little by its license.
1833380	1835380	The original Astro Boy is hard to watch.
1835380	1836700	I'm talking about IPs.
1836700	1839580	All right, well, unfortunately, there's no other calls coming on the Skype line for right
1839580	1845020	now, so we're going to go back to the news, and just so you know, the live listeners,
1845020	1847580	Live 365 may dump the show at any time.
1847580	1849980	Unfortunately, it will be inevitable.
1849980	1853380	We'll just have to keep going, but we're going to keep recording tonight's show, and
1853380	1856420	of course, you'll be able to hear the full thing and anything you might miss because
1856420	1861140	of the Live 365 dump tonight, you can certainly hear it on our podcast, which you can download,
1861140	1863420	of course, at orangelandtraded.com.
1863420	1866260	We would have done the mailbag segment right now, but unfortunately, we didn't get a whole
1866260	1870680	lot of emails, but if you do want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelandtraded.com.
1870680	1873900	If you wanted to maybe call in tonight and get the chance to, you could always send us
1873900	1876340	an email, and Dark Soccer always reads through the emails.
1876340	1877740	But not this week.
1877740	1882080	Yes, and let us know what you think about Hannah Montana, the game, especially because
1882080	1885160	I know there's a lot of music gaming fans that listen to this program because of our
1885160	1888840	history that we did, obviously, a lot with music games in the past.
1888840	1894300	This is a very interesting, I think a lot of people have said in the past, DDR is starting
1894300	1896880	to look more and more like a game for little girls.
1896880	1901180	This doesn't help the music gaming genre break out of that stereotype.
1901180	1906780	Alright, well let's get back into some gaming news and talk about, we were talking a lot
1906780	1911380	before we went to Skype about how Sony is kind of getting all these ideas from other
1911380	1912380	places.
1912380	1915740	At least it seems like, it feels like, and this story certainly doesn't help.
1915740	1916740	You remember Afrika?
1916740	1917740	Afrika!
1917740	1918740	Afrika!
1918740	1919740	Afrika!
1919740	1923460	The game we saw at E3, what, a couple of years ago, that everybody looked at it going, what
1923460	1924460	the fuck is that?
1924460	1926380	Well, we still don't know what the fuck that is.
1926380	1927540	Is it Jamba Safari?
1927540	1928820	If so, that's fucking rad.
1928820	1931380	I'm gonna harpoon me and Gazelle.
1931380	1934700	But apparently the developer said you do not get to attack the animals in Afrika.
1934700	1935700	Aww.
1935700	1939940	Otherwise they have said nothing about the game, but there are rumors, again I must stress
1939940	1946220	rumors because I think this sounds like a load of crap, but the rumor is going out saying
1946220	1954980	that Sony is supposedly going to be releasing a Wii Fit type touch pad to go with Afrika
1954980	1957820	to make the Safari experience complete.
1957820	1962900	Now my question is, how in the fuck does that work?
1962900	1966260	Do you stand on it and then it just like shakes?
1966260	1967260	It's rhinoceros approach?
1967260	1970340	That makes no sense to me whatsoever.
1970340	1973860	That's why I think this was totally pulled out of somebody's butt.
1973860	1980900	The other thing too that's also suggesting that Afrika is going to be out in like January.
1980900	1984340	So I don't think so, since we haven't heard anything about it.
1984340	1986020	And it's Afrika, I mean.
1986020	1988540	Well, could they delay it to maybe add something in?
1988540	1989540	I mean, who knows?
1989540	1992500	Well, it wouldn't be out before the Wii Fit then, now would it?
1992500	1993500	Alright.
1993500	1998940	Just kind of always an interesting story, but I do take it with a huge grain of salt.
1998940	1999940	Yeah.
1999940	2005060	Something else that's interesting, part of EA's plan to totally dominate everything that
2005060	2013060	exists in the world, they are now partnering up with Hasbro to release games based on their
2013060	2019340	favorite properties, including Monopoly, Risk, and Scrabble, as well as toys including G.I.
2019340	2023580	Joe, Tonka, Nerf, and Littlest Pet Shop.
2023580	2025100	They're still doing Littlest Pet Shop?
2025100	2028260	I didn't even realize there was a Littlest Pet Shop.
2028260	2029260	Yay?
2029260	2036340	I don't know, Nerf would be kind of neat, like a first person shooter or Nerf game.
2036340	2038420	I think they actually have had that before.
2038420	2043220	I'd put that in a category of good for them.
2043220	2048700	I wonder if this means Monopoly on Xbox Live Arcade, because that's what we really need.
2048700	2049700	Not in Scrabble.
2049700	2053820	No, because then people will never stop playing, because a Monopoly game on average takes about
2053820	2054820	six hours.
2054820	2055820	Awesome.
2055820	2061100	Well, at least you can't have someone cheat as the banker.
2061100	2063100	True.
2063100	2069700	Speaking of online games, though, Park Associates, who is big for running those studies on online
2069700	2078580	activities, said that there are 34% of adult users on the internet playing games, as compared
2078580	2084780	to 29% on YouTube, and 19% on MySpace and Facebook.
2084780	2091620	So they have shown a 79% growth in online gaming over the year, and only 46% in social
2091620	2093480	networking.
2093480	2095140	So we likes our games.
2095140	2096140	Keep them going.
2096140	2102960	On top of that, though, I've noticed a lot of online games have that social aspect already
2102960	2103960	combined with it.
2103960	2109660	I'll tell you, half the reason I used to play Ragnarok online was on an internet game, but
2109660	2114700	half the reason I used to play that or some of the web-based ones, like I did Gaia for
2114700	2119500	a little bit, was just to chat with people.
2119500	2125380	I totally believe that casual games are as big as sometimes the hardcore gamers forget
2125380	2130680	to admit, because again, I use the example of walking around in the workplace and looking
2130680	2137020	at little cubicles, and so many people playing those freaking PopCap games, like Collapse
2137020	2139140	and what have you.
2139140	2140380	It's an incredible business.
2140380	2142140	They're not supposed to be doing that at work.
2142140	2143380	Well, they do.
2143380	2144780	They can do it on their breaks.
2144780	2146140	Wink, wink.
2146140	2147340	Not on our breaks at my work.
2147340	2148340	Aw, that's too bad.
2148340	2150340	We get stabbed in the head.
2150340	2151340	Really?
2151340	2152340	Yeah, really.
2152340	2153340	That sucks.
2153340	2154340	It's an HR issue.
2154340	2155340	All right.
2155340	2159420	Anyway, well, this might be a future HR issue if you're caught playing this game at work.
2159420	2161840	It's Super Chick Sisters.
2161840	2163420	You might have heard of this game this week.
2163420	2164820	It's from PETA.
2164820	2168540	People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released this game called Super Chick Sisters
2168540	2172260	as part of their website, KentuckyFriedCruelty.com.
2172260	2174180	I played the game, and you know what?
2174180	2176620	I got to tell you, it's not bad.
2176620	2180540	For a little homebrew cook-up title, it's not bad, and it's very tongue-in-cheek.
2180540	2183980	It's obvious that the people who made the game know a little something about video games,
2183980	2185500	because basically, here it is.
2185500	2188780	The premise of the video game, it's kind of like a Mario Brothers rip-off, but instead
2188780	2194540	of Mario Brothers, you have a little chicken named Nugget.
2194540	2195540	Which made me laugh.
2195540	2197420	And then I think Chickadee, I think was the other one.
2197420	2198420	No, Chick and Nugget.
2198420	2199420	Was it?
2199420	2200420	I don't know.
2200420	2201420	Well, whatever.
2201420	2205460	So you have these two things, and I guess Mario and Luigi could not rescue Pamela Anderson,
2205460	2212040	who's dressed as Princess Toadstool or whatever.
2212040	2217440	She has been kidnapped by the evil Colonel, and Mario and Luigi are suffering from a case
2217440	2221380	of Wii-itis, they've been playing too much Nintendo Wii, so their hands are broken.
2221380	2227300	So they can't go rescue, so they have to rely on Chick and Nugget.
2227300	2230420	So you go through these Mario-type levels, instead of collecting coins, you collect these
2230420	2235580	little birds, and then they give you little facts about like, did you play it?
2235580	2241060	I did play it, and I wish more of my Mario Brothers games would have that, hey, did you
2241060	2246180	know that they chop the piece off of chickens and don't even do anything?
2246180	2249140	And did you realize that they boil them alive?
2249140	2250140	That's so horrible.
2250140	2254420	Did you know that they put chickens in the incinerator and boil them?
2254420	2256780	I mean, I was just like, this is amazing.
2256780	2262900	I mean, I'm kind of like- Parking news, KFC tortures chickens.
2262900	2266780	Part of me wants to invite PETA on this show, even though they are such a controversial
2266780	2270460	organization, but part of me goes like, why did you do this?
2270460	2272020	Why did you make a game out of this?
2272020	2274860	You do realize there are copyright laws out there?
2274860	2283140	I mean, there's like, they weren't at all trying to say, oh yeah, it's Larry and Barry
2283140	2287900	or something, but it's Mario and Luigi, and they have Toad in there, and they use the
2287900	2289740	Wii, and they're not afraid about that.
2289740	2294300	In fact, at one point, Mario gets beat up for being cruel to turtles.
2294300	2299140	Oh my god, you played the level three to get that message, I know.
2299140	2304780	Yeah, level three was Mario gets beat up by the people for ethical treatment of turtles,
2304780	2305780	or something like that.
2305780	2310740	I mean, it's very tongue-in-cheek, but it's funny, and it's, you know, whether you agree
2310740	2316220	or disagree with PETA, it's kind of an interesting way to get their message across, because my
2316220	2318940	thing, and the thing I would want to ask PETA, and I swear I'm going to send him an email
2318940	2325020	this week and try to get him on the show, I want to know is, why did they choose to
2325020	2327320	make a game out of this to get their message?
2327320	2332100	Is it because they want to get to that stereotype World of Warcraft player who's doing an all-night
2332100	2333860	raid with a bucket of wings in his lap?
2333860	2335860	I mean, are they trying to get those guys to think twice?
2335860	2336860	The game made me hungry.
2336860	2337860	What is...
2337860	2344660	I've got a $5 gift certificate to KFC, and I'm thinking about using me to get me some
2344660	2345660	chicken to stop.
2345660	2346660	Oh, stop.
2346660	2349020	Even if you read all about the torturous ways of hate.
2349020	2350340	This is kind of funny.
2350340	2352100	I'm kind of digging this game.
2352100	2353100	It's interesting, isn't it?
2353100	2354100	I dig already.
2354100	2359340	All right, so, yeah, DarkTetsuya in chat says, Nintendo will sue.
2359340	2362460	Frisbee says, this makes me want KFC even more.
2362460	2368300	Joshi16 says, but if it's for a good cause, they don't have to care about laws and restrictions.
2368300	2370540	Just look at gross anti-smoking commercials.
2370540	2373940	But my question is, you know, PETA is a very controversial organization.
2373940	2376100	There's a lot of anti-PETA sentiment out there.
2376100	2377300	They may not want their...
2377300	2378740	Especially, I don't think they gave...
2378740	2382140	Obviously, they did not give them permission for this stuff.
2382140	2383520	It's sort of like, what's the business...
2383520	2386140	Is it Walmart that doesn't allow anybody out front of their store?
2386140	2387140	No, it's Target.
2387140	2389460	Target does not allow anybody out front of their store, no matter who they are.
2389460	2390900	I mean, it could be Girl Scouts or anything.
2390900	2393140	They do not allow anybody out front of their store.
2393140	2394460	It's just to be consistent policy.
2394460	2399340	You know, they don't want their name tied to any, you know, Republican, Democrat initiative
2399340	2400980	or whatever it is.
2400980	2402380	So I think it's Target.
2402380	2404620	I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but, you know...
2404620	2406460	I sure as hell know it's not Walmart.
2406460	2410260	Maybe Nintendo wants to be like that where they don't want to be tied to any organization,
2410260	2413700	and I somehow doubt they were asked about this.
2413700	2420080	So, WonderDogHerald says, PETA, as usual, likes to appeal to children for their tactics.
2420080	2421940	People eating tasty animals.
2421940	2422940	Alright.
2422940	2423940	Anyways.
2423940	2426100	If you guys keep saying stuff like that, they're not going to want to come on the show.
2426100	2427100	I gotta...
2427100	2428100	I like chicken!
2428100	2429100	I want to get peed on the show.
2429100	2430100	Freshly decapitated.
2430100	2433140	I didn't get the whole pipe level.
2433140	2435260	That frustrated me, and I turned it off.
2435260	2436260	Yeah, level 3 was...
2436260	2437620	I stopped at level 3, too.
2437620	2439020	It was too hard to figure out.
2439020	2440020	A little over the top.
2440020	2441900	Someone needs some better level design.
2441900	2444820	Again, for a homebrew game, which essentially is, it's not bad.
2444820	2446820	I mean, it's obvious a lot of effort went into this.
2446820	2451620	It wasn't... that's what surprised me most about it, is that it wasn't cheaply put together.
2451620	2453620	That was what I think makes this newsworthy.
2453620	2456360	It wasn't some dumb, crappy little Flash game.
2456360	2458220	They actually put a little effort into this, and that's what made it...
2458220	2464440	The kernel, the spider robot, and someone put in a news article that the kernel wears
2464440	2467820	a Bowser mask at the end of the game as the spider robot.
2467820	2471820	So I didn't get that far, but I don't know.
2471820	2472820	Interesting.
2472820	2479100	Ubisoft is now talking about a brand new top secret game that they have in development.
2479100	2481380	That's going to be focusing on user-generated content.
2481380	2485340	I guess you could kind of compare it to LittleBigPlanet or something of that sort.
2485340	2490460	Anyways, it will allow gamers to support their creations across platforms, sending out pie
2490460	2495580	in the sky meters, or it was apparently according to Joyce, it gets sending their pie in the
2495580	2497380	sky meters off the charts.
2497380	2502500	But I don't know, great, I think a lot more companies are going to start kind of taking
2502500	2507460	this stance and allowing more user-created content instead of banning that.
2507460	2513540	I mean, look at Forza 2 with the whole creating cars, Halo 3 with the new videos that they're
2513540	2514540	uploading.
2514540	2516540	Hell, even before that with Burnout.
2516540	2520380	Revenge where you can upload your gameplay footage and stuff.
2520380	2523180	Sing Star where you're going to be able to do the same thing.
2523180	2527460	So something that we're probably going to see more of.
2527460	2534820	All right, well, Dark Soccer likes to surf the internet up and down every single week
2534820	2538220	and choose a website of her liking to share with all of you.
2538220	2541680	And we call it her website of the week, and I'm curious what Dark Soccer has picked out
2541680	2543220	for the kids this week.
2543220	2552020	Let's play the music and see.
2552020	2557780	The website of the week is PETAKillsAnimals.com.
2557780	2558780	What Rob?
2558780	2561500	Oh boy, there went our chances of getting PETA on the show.
2561500	2562500	All right.
2562500	2570820	It's basically, actually their most recent news were about the recent PETA trial in North
2570820	2573100	Carolina for animal cruelty.
2573100	2581260	Basically they had to submit the numbers of the amount of animals that they had actually
2581260	2583420	killed involved in their research.
2583420	2588180	They have on their, I actually, I remember some of this from being on Penn & Tiller's
2588180	2589180	Bullshit recently.
2589180	2592380	It was a great show by the way.
2592380	2605020	Where one of the charges on their inventories was for a walk-in freezer that cost $9,370.
2605020	2609480	So now I'm going to bring up that show because they actually went and did the size of one
2609480	2610480	of them.
2610480	2614220	So we're talking about for a walk-in freezer that would cost that much, it would be twice
2614220	2619620	the size of the room that we're in right now, a bedroom, seeing how much meat you would
2619620	2621180	store in a walk-in freezer.
2621180	2622940	What about vegetables?
2622940	2623940	Well, no.
2623940	2624940	Vegetables need refrigeration.
2624940	2626820	That's a lot of frozen peas.
2626820	2632520	But there was, there's just quite a bit on here about, you know, exactly what they spelled.
2632520	2637240	The head of PETA is actually on, you know how they say, oh, well don't use this medication
2637240	2639020	because it was tested on animals?
2639020	2647580	The head of PETA is actually on insulin that was, the research was done on animal testing
2647580	2651180	and derived from animal products.
2651180	2652620	I just thought it was very interesting.
2652620	2658460	There's pretty much a company run by hypocrites, but it will.
2658460	2661660	Well I guess we always have to have a counterpoint, every point made on the show, so there you
2661660	2662660	have it.
2662660	2668680	All right, anyhow, let's talk a little bit about Squeenix.
2668680	2675780	We love Squeenix and they are opening their brand new store online on August 20th and
2675780	2678100	they even have a time, 6 p.m. Pacific time.
2678100	2682140	There's going to be a brand new online shop opening up and it's supposed to have Squeenix
2682140	2688860	collectibles, model kits, and clothing accessories, and I wonder if that means buttons or if you'll
2688860	2693900	be able to buy a full cosplay on the website, that would be pretty awesome.
2693900	2698040	Probably some of those Final Fantasy XII action figures like the Balthier one which I have
2698040	2701780	in, because Balthier is very awesome in Final Fantasy XII.
2701780	2705060	So if you're a Squeenix fan, I'm sure you're going to be hitting up their website on August
2705060	2706540	20th, 2007.
2706540	2710420	Unfortunately I don't recall exactly where the website is located, but I'm sure if you
2710420	2715640	go to Squeenix's website at Squeenix.com, there'll be a link right there when the store
2715640	2716640	opens.
2716640	2718780	So be on the lookout for it.
2718780	2726000	Well if in case you're wondering what those large hard drives are for on the PlayStation
2726000	2728740	3, well wonder no more.
2728740	2736540	Actually they are going to be releasing a digital tuner for recording TV and it's supposed
2736540	2740760	to be unveiled at Lipzig here pretty soon.
2740760	2748420	So this has been confirmed by 3Speech, their semi-official blog for Sony.
2748420	2759780	All right, well in other news, they are talking about the chip manufacturers that are behind
2759780	2761860	the Wii shortage.
2761860	2766580	Nintendo wants to up production from what I'm understanding, but they are not able to
2766580	2770300	get the chips they need still.
2770300	2774900	The ones who are making the components are saying that if it keeps up like that, they're
2774900	2778540	not going to be able to keep up with the demand.
2778540	2783180	Hmm, I'm not surprised.
2783180	2791140	All right, well talking about Electronic Arts for a minute, going on over to Macintosh gaming,
2791140	2795540	you know Mac sometimes gets a bad rap because they don't really have a lot of games on it,
2795540	2799620	but you might have heard early in the year EA is supposed to be kind of helping out a
2799620	2800980	little bit more.
2800980	2805220	And EA has actually shipped four games for the Macintosh.
2805220	2810060	They've shipped Battlefield 2142, Need for Speed Carbon, Harry Potter and the Order of
2810060	2813360	the Phoenix, and Command and Conquer 3, Tiberium Wars.
2813360	2816200	So for those of you saying there are no games available on the Mac, well there's four pretty
2816200	2818860	big titles right there, especially Command and Conquer 3, a lot of people love their
2818860	2819940	Command and Conquer.
2819940	2820940	So there you have it.
2820940	2824320	In fact, I got a message earlier this week online asking if I played Command and Conquer
2824320	2826980	and if I wanted to play and I said no, you'd have to ask the Loki because I don't really
2826980	2827980	play that.
2827980	2828980	No, no, Command and Conquer 3.
2828980	2829980	So there you have it.
2829980	2830980	I didn't play it though.
2830980	2831980	Anyways, let's see.
2831980	2842220	I was going to say there's been some interesting stuff going on in the whole EA Wikipedia article
2842220	2843220	there.
2843220	2848700	Apparently some EA staffers have been changing a little bit of history on there, removing
2848700	2854940	key facts about their company, some stuff that they may not be too proud of, and it's
2854940	2855940	been pretty interesting.
2855940	2864380	They've actually traced back the IP address used to make those changes back to EA.
2864380	2874340	And I guess they've been responsible for one-third of the changes made on there of the 1351 changes.
2874340	2875660	Those are from EA.
2875660	2880940	And of course, many of those though have been reversed by the Wikipedia community.
2880940	2888180	EA did come out and say they've actually, they sometimes update websites with info about
2888180	2890220	company games and employees.
2890220	2894780	For example, EA has sent a correction to Yahoo Finance when they had misspelled the name
2894780	2897000	of an EA executive.
2897000	2901420	Many companies routinely post updates on websites like Wikipedia to ensure accuracy of their
2901420	2903220	own corporate information.
2903220	2910380	However, I think deleting information that is negative about your company's past is not
2910380	2914300	exactly following that.
2914300	2915300	It's basically just...
2915300	2916300	That's poor ethics.
2916300	2919620	Yeah, it's hiding the bad spots.
2919620	2923460	Like Wikipedia doesn't allow you to edit an article that's up about yourself, right?
2923460	2927780	Yeah, in fact that is a major violation.
2927780	2930720	Like for instance, I don't touch the OLR article.
2930720	2934140	There is an Orange Orange Radio article on Wikipedia, how it survived this long against
2934140	2938140	their notability rules, I have no idea, but hey, it's there.
2938140	2940900	Probably because I guess since we were lucky enough to have the news articles, then there's
2940900	2943060	been other sources about us, but whatever.
2943060	2946700	I've never touched the article, although I'm always fascinated reading the updates and
2946700	2949020	the work that other people have put into it.
2949020	2953180	But I just won't touch it because I'm like, well that's kind of weird.
2953180	2957100	Like there's things I want to go fix in it, like some of the shows that aren't on anymore.
2957100	2959020	I fixed grammatical errors.
2959020	2960020	Did you?
2960020	2961020	I guess I have.
2961020	2962020	I guess that's different.
2962020	2966740	Grammatical errors is one thing, but I don't touch it because, I don't know, it's weird.
2966740	2968700	Some folks in chat are saying, you're welcome.
2968700	2969700	You're welcome.
2969700	2974340	Joshi16 says, Wikipedia is becoming corporate propaganda machine.
2974340	2975340	Interesting.
2975340	2976780	Interesting perspective.
2976780	2979420	You know, that's not the only Wikipedia thing I read about this week.
2979420	2984660	I heard that the, was it the ESA supposedly was going onto Wikipedia and had edited some
2984660	2987500	articles on like abandonware and stuff too, and they were deleting things.
2987500	2989140	Like there's some IPs traced back.
2989140	2990900	I want to say I read something about that somewhere.
2990900	2992780	I think I remember that too, yeah.
2992780	2996700	So kind of interesting, all this Wikipedia information that's come out this week.
2996700	2997700	I think ours needs a bit of an update.
2997700	2998700	I was just looking at it.
2998700	3001780	Yeah, it probably needs a small update, but I don't want to do it myself.
3001780	3004460	So maybe a kind listener will go in there and clean it up.
3004460	3006460	We'll see.
3006460	3009820	Anyways, let's see.
3009820	3015520	Well, actually, I had a little bit of news in regards to stuff coming out on the Virtual
3015520	3018860	Console and the PSP.
3018860	3023580	There is actually a Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.
3023580	3026300	It has actually been rated for a Wii release.
3026300	3031300	And LucasArts is bringing out Indiana Jones to the PSP, tentatively titled as Indiana
3031300	3035220	Jones 2008, but it's not Lego.
3035220	3039580	Dude, I wonder if it's based on the old Indiana Jones arcade game.
3039580	3040580	That game was pretty awesome.
3040580	3041580	That would be rad.
3041580	3044900	Well, they did have, was it that Indiana Jones game that was being worked on by LucasArts,
3044900	3046660	the one that was supposed to be all, you know.
3046660	3048900	That was the Indiana Jones 2008.
3048900	3054460	Yeah, but still this could be something like that, or maybe tying in with the new Indiana
3054460	3055460	Jones movie.
3055460	3056460	Maybe.
3056460	3057460	I don't know.
3057460	3060300	Harrison Ford is too old.
3060300	3061300	He's never too old.
3061300	3062300	They'll make him a robot.
3062300	3066700	Well, I guess if Bruce Willis can do it, Harrison Ford can.
3066700	3071860	Alright, well, one more story for you guys before we get into some last minute stories
3071860	3072860	tonight.
3072860	3078100	Dementium, The War, is a brand new game coming out for the DS, and I think what kind of sets
3078100	3082480	this apart from most other games is it's kind of like, I guess you could call it like Silent
3082480	3090980	Hilly, scary, bloody, gross, rated mature for the DS, and it's coming out on Halloween.
3090980	3097140	October 31st is the release date for this game, Dementium, and it's, I guess it's actually
3097140	3105500	based off an independent title by Renegade Kid, and Dementium is a mature rated game,
3105500	3110900	and it looks like it's going to be kind of like, you know, that type Silent Hill horror
3110900	3111900	type game.
3111900	3114620	I was actually thinking of the Call of Cthulhu game.
3114620	3119420	Well, remember they have that one with a touch to the dead a while back that was also a mature
3119420	3124500	rated title that was more of a shooter, but I think around the same side, Insecticides
3124500	3127580	was supposed to be coming out on the DS as well, so that one was pretty cool.
3127580	3132940	That was that adventure game that was kind of film noir, but with insects.
3132940	3137020	We don't see a lot of survival horror on the DS nonetheless, so kind of interesting.
3137020	3139020	It looks good.
3139020	3143220	I haven't seen too much on this game, but I'm always interested in more survival horror
3143220	3146380	games, because they always succeed in scaring the pants off of me.
3146380	3148120	So there you have it.
3148120	3151260	Let's go around and see if there's any last minute stories here in studio.
3151260	3154940	We would have done the Skype line right now, but of course since we're afraid, I guess
3154940	3156220	the live listeners are still connected.
3156220	3159700	It's 805, and the maintenance was supposed to happen at 8 o'clock, but we're still on
3159700	3160700	air, so.
3160700	3161700	Breaking news.
3161700	3162700	We're still here.
3162700	3163700	I guess so.
3163700	3166300	We're going to try and keep going until they turn off the lights on us, so let's go around
3166300	3170060	and get any last minute stories, then we'll open up the Skype line a little longer until
3170060	3171060	we get booted.
3171060	3173420	I don't know if any more calls will come in, but we'll see.
3173420	3174420	Okay.
3174420	3175420	I've got some last minute stories.
3175420	3182620	Ninja Gaiden 2 is going to be debuting on the Xbox 360, and with PlayStation 3 coming
3182620	3185600	later on, it's supposed to debut at Tokyo Game Show.
3185600	3192360	That is the rumor coming from GameSpot Korea, so it'll be interesting to check that out.
3192360	3199540	Let's see here, Halo 3 of course nearing completion, almost gold right now, and there's been some
3199540	3205060	interesting details on this new Bungie Pro program that's going to be happening, and
3205060	3212420	basically what Bungie Pro is, is it's going to be a, anyone that has a copy of Halo 3
3212420	3218020	and a gold subscription will be allocated six slots, or 25 megabytes of space to upload
3218020	3220040	gameplay videos and whatnot.
3220040	3227480	Now if you decide to purchase Bungie Pro, what you'll get is 250 megabytes across 24
3227480	3232820	slots and it'll be worth 750 points, which is going to be good for one year, so that's
3232820	3233820	kind of interesting.
3233820	3239180	If you're really into your gameplay shots, then that might be something to look forward
3239180	3240180	to.
3240180	3245420	Another thing, according to V Jump, there's a scan of some new Hudson Soft games called
3245420	3250820	Deca Sporta, and it looks kind of like Wii Sports a little bit, they've got, it looks
3250820	3259940	like Go Kart Racing, they actually have Archery, and it looks like Tennis of course, and Basketball,
3259940	3264100	so that's kind of cool, oh and Volleyball.
3264100	3270860	Let's see what else here, Halo the movie has been apparently reconfirmed that it's coming
3270860	3274060	and is apparently already filming in New Zealand.
3274060	3280980	Bullshit, yeah that's what I'm thinking too, this is coming from XboxFamily.com, so I don't
3280980	3285540	believe it, but we'll see, that it?
3285540	3289700	There's one other thing, I heard some interesting stuff this week, a game I did not realize
3289700	3297540	was coming out this fall, apparently, was it Kingdom of Fire, Circle of Doom is supposed
3297540	3302300	to be coming out in early December, I thought that was coming out in 2008.
3302300	3305860	Speaking of upcoming games, what have you heard about Two Worlds, anything?
3305860	3311180	It's just like Oblivion, but with online multiplayer as well, you can play quests online with people
3311180	3312180	to co-op.
3312180	3315040	I've been curious about that game, very curious, and of course it's coming out the same week
3315040	3319300	as Bioshock, so it's going to be a tough week, but I actually was very curious about that
3319300	3322060	game, thinking about picking it up, but I wish there was a demo online or something
3322060	3323060	like that.
3323060	3326780	Well let me go this way, apparently it's supposed to be pretty cool, and they've gone to great
3326780	3332280	details in it, in fact they've actually motion captured bunnies that are in the game, rad!
3332280	3336260	And the day and night cycles are supposed to be pretty cool, and I don't know, it's
3336260	3342340	kind of like Oblivion, but it's all third person, and I don't really know much beyond
3342340	3343340	that.
3343340	3347540	It looks cool, but I think unfortunately it's coming out the same week as Bioshock.
3347540	3348580	It would have been a different audience.
3348580	3351740	It originally was supposed to come out last week, which would have been perfect, because
3351740	3355740	it's Madden and that, and that would have been a pretty good game to pick up if you're
3355740	3356740	not into Madden.
3356740	3359500	Well, but a lot of people aren't into first person shooters either, like I said at the
3359500	3364300	top of the show, I may think Bioshock is amazing, but I still kind of am first person shooters.
3364300	3367340	Maybe you can buy Bioshock, I'll buy Two Worlds and we can trade off later, that would be
3367340	3368340	fun.
3368340	3369340	I'll see.
3369340	3370340	Alright.
3370340	3371580	Jamie, do you have any last minute stories tonight?
3371580	3373540	I'm actually looking at old games right now.
3373540	3374960	Looking at old school stuff?
3374960	3375960	Star Parodia.
3375960	3377740	Any particular reason?
3377740	3380860	Because someone mentioned Star Soldier, and I was like no no no no no no, you need to
3380860	3382860	play Star Parodia.
3382860	3386700	Only game where you can play as a flying PC Engine, the Vic Viper, or Bomberman in the
3386700	3387700	same game.
3387700	3391300	Alright, well I have some very quick last minute news for you guys.
3391300	3396140	Footy Monster was sending me a link, apparently the Bioshock PC demo is coming out tomorrow
3396140	3399940	at 7 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, that would be 4 o'clock Pacific.
3399940	3406380	So the Bioshock PC demo is coming out, this is according to a post from the 2K Games forum,
3406380	3408500	so it is probably legit.
3408500	3411460	You can of course download it at most of the usual suspect sites, but something to think
3411460	3415180	about, you probably want to make sure you have the latest drivers for your video card
3415180	3420580	before you download that big old game, otherwise you might be sorry.
3420580	3424360	Maybe I'll get Bioshock for the PC over the 360, who knows, but then again I want achievement
3424360	3425360	points because of achievement points.
3425360	3428580	I don't think it's going to run that well on PC, at least not on our PC.
3428580	3430620	Probably not on my PC, that's true.
3430620	3436260	One other thing to speak about here, Nintendo Power has apparently given Metroid Prime 3
3436260	3438140	a 10 out of 10.
3438140	3439660	Wow, really?
3439660	3443420	A Nintendo Run magazine giving their game a 10 out of 10?
3443420	3444420	That's so surprising.
3444420	3450180	Hold on, because something that the story notes is that you may or may not remember,
3450180	3455040	but Ocarina of Time only got a 9.5 from Nintendo Power, so the fact they gave this a 10 out
3455040	3457140	of 10 does make your eyebrow raise a little bit.
3457140	3462780	Oh wow, okay, so a 9.5, because that's really different than a 10.
3462780	3467380	It's almost perfect, but Metroid, that's perfect.
3467380	3471140	Really do you think they would have to sell more of Ocarina of Time?
3471140	3477900	I think that game sells itself, whereas Metroid Prime maybe needs a little help to be selling
3477900	3479220	some of those units.
3479220	3481220	Yeah, I know.
3481220	3485460	I don't know if it's especially newsworthy because it is a Nintendo magazine, but I will
3485460	3490220	be very impressed if it starts getting more perfect reviews from other places.
3490220	3493940	Even the official Xbox magazine sometimes rags on some of the releases.
3493940	3495100	I want to say I read some review.
3495100	3500100	I think they gave Track and Field a 3 on the Xbox Live Arcade, which I don't know.
3500100	3505420	For some people it might have been too high of a score, and a lot of folks are giving
3505420	3507460	Bioshock, of course, very high scores.
3507460	3512260	Joshi16 in chat is pointing out that Bioshock got a 10 out of 10 from the original Xbox
3512260	3514700	magazine, but is that really a shock?
3514700	3515700	Is it?
3515700	3516700	Who knows?
3516700	3520860	Nintendo Maniac 64 says Ocarina of Time's negative 0.5 was from Navi.
3520860	3526380	Listen, listen, listen, goddammit, listen!
3526380	3530060	All right, well, that pretty much does it for all the stories tonight.
3530060	3532900	I don't really think we have anything else.
3532900	3535260	I opened up the Skype line and told the chat they could call in.
3535260	3539220	I'll give one more shout if you guys want to get through 1-877, because I guess they're
3539220	3547020	still live and still going, 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
3547020	3548980	Call!
3548980	3550320	We'll see.
3550320	3551320	If not...
3551320	3552320	Ah, there we go.
3552320	3554140	We're getting some calls now.
3554140	3555140	Just takes a little bit.
3555140	3557740	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3557740	3558740	Legend of Zaku.
3558740	3560740	Oh, see, because you missed the first wave.
3560740	3562100	What's on your mind, Zaku?
3562100	3564220	Nah, I just came back from 8 on the break.
3564220	3565220	How was that?
3565220	3570260	Just had a little 2DX tournament today, managed to be some chumps and, you know, distorted.
3570260	3574220	But yeah, Champions of the Coast wasn't so bad this weekend.
3574220	3577060	You're always going to some tournament on the East Coast, it seems like.
3577060	3579660	Actually, it's my first 2DX tournament.
3579660	3582060	Wow, well, how was the 2DX tournament set up?
3582060	3583060	Was it fun?
3583060	3584500	Yeah, it was pretty good.
3584500	3589020	I mean, there were, you know, we didn't have to qualify since there were not, you know,
3589020	3593700	not that many people to actually, I mean, there was a lot of people, but not enough
3593700	3599100	to actually warrant one, so it was just random seating, but yeah, it was just having to go
3599100	3604100	through people and just playing on, you know, from particular sides.
3604100	3607160	I didn't know you were much of a BeatMania 2DX player.
3607160	3613620	Of course, man, but yeah, I've also, but if there's anything that would make that whole
3613620	3616060	weekend is just seeing a 2DX freestyle.
3616060	3618060	A 2DX freestyle?
3618060	3619060	Yes.
3619060	3620060	How did that work?
3620060	3626180	The break is the only place we can freestyle any machine, any of their music or dancing
3626180	3627180	machines.
3627180	3630060	Well, who did that and what did they do?
3630060	3636740	They did Tangerine Streams, some sort of, you know, homoerotic stuff, no offense, but
3636740	3642140	there were two guys just like, you know, one with the long hair, just petting them while
3642140	3647220	they were hitting the keys, you know, petting his hair and pressing it up.
3647220	3648220	Interesting.
3648220	3650220	Yeah, that's what I think.
3650220	3653820	Okay, I'm going to challenge you this week.
3653820	3657220	Tell me something in your gaming week that has nothing to do with music games.
3657220	3659300	What other kinds of games do you play?
3659300	3660300	I don't know.
3660300	3665580	I'm just thinking about a 360, but since, you know, the failure rate's too high, I don't
3665580	3671700	know if Bioshock or anything like, you know, Halo 3 Gears of War would just be, would just
3671700	3675100	outweigh all the risks in just buying a 360 in the first place.
3675100	3679980	Dude, you're the second caller tonight to tell us that the failure rate issues are making
3679980	3682020	you contemplate the 360.
3682020	3683020	That's making me nervous.
3683020	3684020	It's interesting.
3684020	3690620	And God forbid a PS3, and I know I don't want to pick the latter, so I don't really have
3690620	3694340	that much of a choice right now.
3694340	3700860	As a person who personally owns multiple Xbox 360 systems and has never had one crap out
3700860	3705020	for heat issues, I don't know what the hell people are talking about.
3705020	3712580	I mean seriously, okay, maybe your system, okay, maybe you may have, you know, the unlikely
3712580	3714300	situation where your system craps out.
3714300	3715300	Who gives a shit?
3715300	3718300	You have a fucking three year warranty on the heat related issues.
3718300	3720300	It gets replaced within a couple weeks.
3720300	3722060	That's the issue.
3722060	3725860	They're making me wait two, three weeks just to get, just to get a new one.
3725860	3727860	Boo fucking who?
3727860	3729860	That's what I have to fucking say about that.
3729860	3735980	I don't, I don't get why Sony can make a PS3 that craps out, you know, at a blue moon,
3735980	3742700	and 360s is like what, like four in ten consoles, like what, one in four consoles are breaking
3742700	3743700	out?
3743700	3744700	Come on.
3744700	3746400	How do we know that their console won't crap out?
3746400	3750140	There hasn't been enough games to play on it that have fucking actually done anything.
3750140	3754140	I mean the reason why the systems crap out for the 360, I think a lot of people are putting
3754140	3758220	these in their entertainment cabinets and they're just doing stupid shit with them.
3758220	3762100	And okay, let's say for example that there is something wrong with, you know, the heat
3762100	3763780	sink on the chip.
3763780	3766700	All the new consoles now have the upgraded heat sinks on them.
3766700	3772340	If you happen to get an older one by some magical, you know, mistake, they will fix
3772340	3776500	it within a couple weeks and that will be the end of your problems altogether.
3776500	3778820	Why waiting two weeks for something is a big deal.
3778820	3779820	Okay, okay.
3779820	3783000	But I don't want to be, I don't want to have those horror, I don't want to be, play out
3783000	3787780	the horror stories of having to go through eight, ten consoles just to get it right.
3787780	3791580	I mean it's just, it's just, it's retarded to just have to go through multiple consoles.
3791580	3793140	You're not, hold on, shut up for a minute.
3793140	3796060	I died, not used that good, but look.
3796060	3800960	I did have an Xbox 360 that did crap out on me after four days and I was so fucking pissed
3800960	3801960	when it happened.
3801960	3805140	You remember on this program I was blah, blah, blah, don't you fucking buy a 360 because
3805140	3806820	they'll fucking die on you, blah, blah, blah.
3806820	3809440	I was so pissed when it happened, but I'm over it.
3809440	3813220	I mean they were quick, they got, they got the job done.
3813220	3814780	I mean it didn't take two or three weeks.
3814780	3815780	I had it back that week.
3815780	3816780	Did they pay for shipping?
3816780	3817780	Did they pay for everything?
3817780	3824020	Did they pay for shipping, you know, they sent me a box, they sent me a coffin to send
3824020	3825020	it back in.
3825020	3826420	I heard they don't do that anymore.
3826420	3827420	I think they still do.
3827420	3830300	That's the thing, then I have to incur charges when I should be.
3830300	3833620	You're not going to incur any charges, then you're talking about like they're going to
3833620	3835020	have to replace the system eight times.
3835020	3838540	If that were the case, they wouldn't be selling millions of fucking consoles.
3838540	3841380	This wouldn't be like a hot selling item.
3841380	3843940	You already have that happening to certain people.
3843940	3848140	Here's what the problem is, you hear fucking idiots on the god damn internet that bitch
3848140	3852700	like fucking little babies about their fucking console breaking, and everyone's like, oh
3852700	3855460	my god, all of them are breaking all at once.
3855460	3856460	Don't give me that bullshit.
3856460	3857460	I have a migraine now.
3857460	3858460	All right.
3858460	3859460	Okay.
3859460	3860460	Hold on.
3860460	3865340	Here's my other thought, though, is that what about that the new Xbox 360s have like the
3865340	3867340	new chips in them or whatever?
3867340	3869180	That's yet to be seen.
3869180	3875380	I mean, if those are if those break out less, you know, like, you know, once in a blue moon
3875380	3880780	or they're very, very rare, then I'll hop on it, you know, you know, at the top of the
3880780	3881780	hat.
3881780	3882780	I'll tell you what.
3882780	3883780	I'll tell you what.
3883780	3885980	Drew Nami in chat says, Loki, you need to fag your anger.
3885980	3886980	I'll tell you what.
3886980	3887980	Fine.
3887980	3888980	You can go ahead and skip buying a 360.
3888980	3889980	I'll enjoy playing Bioshock.
3889980	3892700	You can go ahead and wait for the next big game to come out for the PlayStation.
3892700	3894700	Oh, I'm sure I'll be next year sometime.
3894700	3897980	I would say he could get it on PC, but he has a Mac, right?
3897980	3902740	I'm building a new PC anyway, so that's going to be happening a few days once I start ordering
3902740	3903740	the parts.
3903740	3910300	I've already set aside a good 15, 1600 for so it's come the PC can hold me for now.
3910300	3914980	And then hopefully by Christmas, once we know whether the new heat sinks will actually make
3914980	3918660	a difference, then I'll think about, well, the PC might hold you, but will it give it
3918660	3919660	the reach around?
3919660	3920660	Oh, no.
3920660	3923580	La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
3923580	3930500	And on that note, look, Zaku, I appreciate the springer-fied call that this show got,
3930500	3932020	but we appreciate the perspective.
3932020	3933020	Yes.
3933020	3934020	Sorry, Zaku.
3934020	3935020	Time's up.
3935020	3936020	Take care though.
3936020	3937020	All right.
3937020	3938020	Bye.
3938020	3939020	Bye.
3939020	3940020	I can have new calls?
3940020	3941020	Seriously.
3941020	3942020	Seriously.
3942020	3943020	People talking about fucking heat sinks and issues with it.
3943020	3945100	This is more than just Zaku though.
3945100	3949340	This is your pent up anger at all the internet blogs and people across the entire internet
3949340	3951580	that have made people like Zaku.
3951580	3953180	I don't know what the fuck they want.
3953180	3956540	I mean, they've already decided, they've already made revisions to fix this problem.
3956540	3958740	They have a three-year fucking warranty on it.
3958740	3960080	What the hell more do you want?
3960080	3965620	I mean, if you're Sony PlayStation 3 craps out on you, good luck in it fixed.
3965620	3966620	Maybe you could like do my dishes.
3966620	3967620	I don't know.
3967620	3968620	It'd be pretty awesome.
3968620	3969620	I don't know.
3969620	3970620	It's just, it's stupid.
3970620	3971620	It really is.
3971620	3972620	All right.
3972620	3973620	Another call.
3973620	3974620	One more call, then this is it.
3974620	3975620	Hi.
3975620	3976620	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
3976620	3977620	Who's this?
3977620	3978620	Hello.
3978620	3979620	It's Paradox Vincent.
3979620	3980620	Hello, Paradox Vincent.
3980620	3981620	What's on your mind?
3981620	3982620	Hey.
3982620	3983620	How are you?
3983620	3984620	I'm good.
3984620	3985620	How are you?
3985620	3986620	Not bad.
3986620	3987620	Not much.
3987620	3988620	Just calling in after a while.
3988620	3992740	I haven't been able to really listen to the show live, but finally got sat down and sit
3992740	3994980	down and talk to you guys again.
3994980	3995980	Yeah.
3995980	3996980	Well, what's up?
3996980	3999820	Was there a story tonight you wanted to comment on?
3999820	4007220	I did play the Kentucky Fried Cruelty Chicken Game, and it was pretty good.
4007220	4013700	It's definitely better than a lot of charity organizations putting up web games on there.
4013700	4015900	It was fun and stuff.
4015900	4019660	It was certainly better than most politically oriented games, and even better than a lot
4019660	4021740	of Homebrew, which, oh, I can't believe.
4021740	4022940	I'm so sorry, Paradox Vincent.
4022940	4024740	I've got to go on a tangent for a minute.
4024740	4030980	Did you hear about the Homebrew that was on the DS that was like, avoid the gay mob or
4030980	4033340	whatever it is?
4033340	4037500	You control the little character, and then if you get hit by the mob, it goes, oh, you
4037500	4039340	got hit by a gay person.
4039340	4040340	Game over.
4040340	4041340	It's huge.
4041340	4046060	It's been hitting all these websites because it's like, oh my gosh, homophobia in the Homebrew
4046060	4047260	scene.
4047260	4050820	I just kind of read it going, well, there's idiots everywhere.
4050820	4055540	The unfortunate thing is that when you give this guy attention, unfortunately, more people
4055540	4057840	are going to seek this game out and play it.
4057840	4062700	Not just people who like gay guys who want to play it and laugh at it for being stupid,
4062700	4065380	which I admit I was tempted to do, but I didn't.
4065380	4068500	But then you're also going to have people that inadvertently read about this through
4068500	4074860	sites like MTV or whatever that report on it going, yeah, I do hate gays.
4074860	4078580	I want to play this game, and I want to find this guy who made this game and help him make
4078580	4079820	a better game.
4079820	4080820	I don't know.
4080820	4084680	I don't think we should give these kinds of things any attention whatsoever.
4084680	4087460	So maybe I shouldn't have said anything about it at all, but I just thought the whole thing
4087460	4090440	was very interesting, and the Homebrew was really bad.
4090440	4091440	It's really bad.
4091440	4092940	Anyway, sorry, Paradox.
4092940	4093940	Really bad, Homebrew.
4093940	4094940	Yes, really bad.
4094940	4096740	So, okay, back to the PETA game.
4096740	4101740	What do you think was their motivations for making it?
4101740	4109020	You know, it's either what you said in trying to kind of target the video game playing audience
4109020	4118740	and tell them, hey, Kentucky Fried Chicken is bad, or they could have just been seeking
4118740	4125700	out a new media to get their message out, and then they noticed that web games are pretty
4125700	4126700	popular.
4126700	4132360	So then they just chose that route, which, I mean, there are certain things that I like
4132360	4138940	to convey more through music and film that it's not necessarily targeting a specific
4138940	4147940	audience but just kind of getting things views out there, so it could have just been that.
4147940	4159460	What I'm also curious about, because it kind of got me thinking about it, is that if they
4159460	4164100	chose to do this to connect with a gaming audience, it kind of worked, didn't it?
4164100	4168280	Because all the major gaming blogs reported on it, and I probably would have never heard
4168280	4171960	of this game had it not been posted, like all these different blogs are on the internet.
4171960	4175580	So in a way, it kind of worked, and it kind of did get their message out there, huh?
4175580	4176580	Here's the thing.
4176580	4182020	It got the attention because it's on all these game blogs.
4182020	4185300	You know they're going to get a cease and desist for this.
4185300	4187140	That's going to be even more attention for them.
4187140	4188140	Do you think?
4188140	4189140	I don't think they will.
4189140	4190140	I think they will.
4190140	4191860	All right, we'll see.
4191860	4192860	I wouldn't know.
4192860	4193860	All right.
4193860	4197780	Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Paradox Vincent?
4197780	4201740	Yes, two things, and I'll try to get them done real quick.
4201740	4204140	Quick guitar hero, 80s review.
4204140	4205140	Great song list.
4205140	4211820	I love almost every song in there, and they gave me a couple new favorite songs, but they're
4211820	4219660	just really kind of not great charts, especially the turning Japanese chart was really boring,
4219660	4225740	but I guess it's Activision's first real take at a music game, to my understanding, and
4225740	4230020	hopefully they'll be getting better by the time Guitar Hero 3 comes out.
4230020	4237620	This is Harmonic's third game, Guitar Hero was, so they already knew what they were doing
4237620	4238620	a lot.
4238620	4245300	Also, I don't know if anybody's heard, but there is a 2DEX gold machine in Arizona right
4245300	4251820	now as of probably about a month and a half ago, and it's at Mesa Golf Land, Sun Splash,
4251820	4257340	and the one-player turntable right now, though, is broke or stolen or something as I know
4257340	4258340	it.
4258340	4263140	That I would have never have guessed, because Mesa Golf Land is just like Roseville Golf
4263140	4264140	Land.
4264140	4270180	It's huge and it has the water park, if I remember right, and everything.
4270180	4276220	And they might be getting a popin' music machine, but they just said mics.
4276220	4279020	I'm hoping they will, though, so that's really all.
4279020	4281460	All right, well, thanks so much for the call.
4281460	4282460	Appreciate it, Paradox Vincent.
4282460	4283460	You have a great week, okay?
4283460	4284460	All right, you guys too.
4284460	4285460	All right, later.
4285460	4286460	See ya.
4286460	4289860	Have lots of fun playing the 2DEX gold machine, that's for sure.
4289860	4292820	You know what's funny, though, is I think the PD game worked in reverse for me, because
4292820	4298060	I forgot about, you know, KFC, you know, they kind of fell off my radar as far as food options.
4298060	4300540	I'm like, you know, hey, KFC sounds kind of good right now.
4300540	4302780	I was sort of thinking about getting fried chicken on the way home.
4302780	4303780	You guys.
4303780	4304780	I'm a southern girl.
4304780	4308300	I grew up on fried chicken and grits.
4308300	4311700	Here's one thing I do love about KFC, is that most of them-
4311700	4312700	Biscuits.
4312700	4313700	No, no, no, no.
4313700	4314700	Most of them have A&Ws attached to them.
4314700	4315700	Biscuits.
4315700	4318660	A&W root beer is the bomb when it comes out of the tap.
4318660	4319660	Biscuits.
4319660	4320660	There was one time- Biscuits and honey.
4320660	4321660	All right, biscuits.
4321660	4322660	We get it.
4322660	4324940	There was one time I passed it up and I really wanted to do it.
4324940	4327900	They were selling root beer in gallon jugs, like the mojo.
4327900	4328900	They were.
4328900	4329900	I was like, whoa.
4329900	4330900	I remember that.
4330900	4331900	That's good shit.
4331900	4332900	They were big things.
4332900	4334260	They were root beer right out of the tap.
4334260	4335260	Wow.
4335260	4337660	And Julie and I got three of them and drank them in a night.
4337660	4338660	It was fantastic.
4338660	4340220	It was diet reaper.
4340220	4342540	Quick comments from the recent phone call there.
4342540	4343540	We're still live.
4343540	4345540	It's been 25 minutes since the maintenance was supposed to start.
4345540	4346540	We're still live.
4346540	4347540	Hey, hey.
4347540	4348540	God damn life.
4348540	4349540	You thought I'm screwing us all up.
4349540	4350540	Oh, well.
4350540	4352140	Have you had any sort of retraction notices or anything?
4352140	4353140	I don't know.
4353140	4354140	I'm not even going to bother with it.
4354140	4355140	No, they were smart.
4355140	4358300	They would just say that they're taking the service offline for a while to protest the
4358300	4363980	whole law going in place, even though they were doing maintenance.
4363980	4365980	Don't even get me started.
4365980	4367620	You know, I don't see anything about it.
4367620	4368620	Let me see.
4368620	4370140	I'm going to check this over.
4370140	4372780	Meanwhile, raw steel UT says, Rob, it didn't work.
4372780	4374140	We're still going to eat KFC.
4374140	4380420	I don't know, but if a couple people changed their mind, maybe some people would tell you
4380420	4381420	it was worth it.
4381420	4385260	And I showed it to another friend of mine, and another friend of mine played it and said,
4385260	4388020	oh, wow, you know, I don't want KFC anymore.
4388020	4391420	The only thing I'm pissed off about KFC is they got rid of their chicken livers.
4391420	4395780	I used to love those things, and they used to have, I think, some sweet and sour sauce,
4395780	4397580	and I think they got rid of that stuff too.
4397580	4400620	I love their sweet and sour sauce.
4400620	4404500	Josie 16 says, I'm going to order fried chicken right now to protest.
4404500	4406300	I used to get their chicken livers all the time.
4406300	4407300	They came in a big bucket.
4407300	4408300	You get gravy with it.
4408300	4410460	Oh, my God, that was so good.
4410460	4413460	You need to have the chicken livers at Roscoe's, though.
4413460	4414700	All right.
4414700	4416020	That's going to do it for tonight's show.
4416020	4418620	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4418620	4420620	Loki, we'll start off with you tonight.
4420620	4421740	Your final thought.
4421740	4426580	I get some Bioshock next week, and that makes me happy.
4426580	4431540	My final thought is ow, tooth, hurt, hate, dentist, cry.
4431540	4433140	Darsarha, your final thought.
4433140	4435180	I think I want some chicken liver right now.
4435180	4436180	All right.
4436180	4438900	Thank you, guys, for tuning in and listening to us tonight.
4438900	4442780	Thank you to all the live listeners, and sorry the maintenance didn't happen to what was
4442780	4444340	supposed to happen.
4444340	4445340	Very interesting.
4445340	4452580	No, I'm surprised that PETA hasn't shut down our peep jousting tournaments that we do once
4452580	4456500	in a while because, you know, marshmallow chickens, they're still chickens.
4456500	4457500	All right.
4457500	4458780	Well, that's it, guys.
4458780	4462220	Thank you so much, especially to you podcast folks, also thank you for downloading us and
4462220	4466500	supporting our show, and thank you for all the positive reviews that some of you left
4466500	4467500	on iTunes.
4467500	4469340	We always really appreciate stuff like that.
4469340	4471740	And thank you for supporting the show, you know, and if you love Orange Lounge Radio,
4471740	4472740	we do it for free.
4472740	4474340	We don't put ads in the show.
4474340	4478580	Tell two people you know about Orange Lounge Radio, and that's how we spread the word.
4478580	4479580	Take a step up.
4479580	4480580	Three people.
4480580	4484380	Independent radio needs your support in order to survive because we don't have any major
4484380	4486540	magazines we can run ads in or anything like that.
4486540	4487540	So that's it.
4487540	4489660	I'll get off my high horse now and sign off.
4489660	4491020	Goodbye, Loki.
4491020	4492020	Goodbye, Dark Sakura.
4492020	4493020	Goodbye, me.
