WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.580
And welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio here on this lovely Sunday evening August the 5th of

00:05.980 --> 00:11.580
2007 if you missed part a our show is a little bit in limbo tonight or a little bit broken first off

00:11.580 --> 00:13.080
We have no Jamie tonight

00:13.080 --> 00:15.320
She's unfortunately had a family emergency

00:15.320 --> 00:20.420
so we all are of course thinking I'm about her at this time and and definitely we'll be seeing her next week after she's

00:20.940 --> 00:22.940
got all that taken care of and

00:23.240 --> 00:25.240
Also, we're in temporary studio

00:25.400 --> 00:29.700
Obviously we weren't here last week because we were moving and we thought the new place would be up and running this week

00:29.700 --> 00:32.760
However, the unfortunate thing is thanks to Comcast

00:32.760 --> 00:37.940
We have no internet at the new place because you have to wait like two weeks to get an appointment if you're an existing customer

00:38.680 --> 00:44.000
So it takes forever. So we're here from the temporary studio Loki and that's where we are tonight

00:44.000 --> 00:47.280
So if you notice a lot of our usual sound effects are missing or we kind of sound different

00:47.280 --> 00:50.240
That's a big reason why but we're really excited about the new studio

00:50.240 --> 00:54.120
It's gonna be so much more space than before. I'm just worried about it is a garage

00:54.120 --> 00:59.620
It's an insulated garage, but I'm just worried about the heat issues, but we'll worry and the echo

00:59.620 --> 01:03.480
Cuz it's got a bad echo problem, too. We'll see we're gonna try and make it work by next week

01:03.480 --> 01:08.140
So we're hoping to pull through for you for episode number 242 in the meantime

01:08.140 --> 01:14.560
Let's get back into some gaming news and we're going to start off with some big news on the Xbox 360 big big news on

01:14.560 --> 01:16.240
the Xbox 360

01:16.240 --> 01:20.900
The $50 price break has been all but confirmed by Circuit City

01:21.300 --> 01:28.440
Circuit City has put a brand new flyer out there that shows that there is a price drop on all the systems the elite coming down

01:28.440 --> 01:34.720
To $449 the premium coming down to $349 and the core system coming down to $279

01:35.080 --> 01:41.560
What should also be noted is that the premium system the three now $349.99 system is going to include

01:42.200 --> 01:45.800
Rockstar table tennis so you get a free game with it now, which is pretty awesome

01:46.040 --> 01:50.480
Even if the game is really only 20 bucks because Rockstar table tennis was cut down in price

01:50.520 --> 01:52.760
That's better than no game at all, right?

01:52.760 --> 02:00.760
That is true, and they're still you know denying that they have a price cut coming, but I think we know better than that

02:01.920 --> 02:08.600
Usually Microsoft rumors end up to be true. Yes, and of course you know that's made its rounds all over the internet

02:09.640 --> 02:13.680
Except that's you know not the only announcement coming this week

02:14.920 --> 02:19.640
Probably by now by the time you download this podcast you will have heard that all the new

02:19.640 --> 02:23.760
360 systems coming out as of this week and

02:24.880 --> 02:26.880
into infinity I guess

02:27.600 --> 02:29.600
Will now all have HDMI

02:30.200 --> 02:31.520
so

02:31.520 --> 02:37.360
Don't have to spend the big bucks for the elite even the core even the core system will have my theory of the core system

02:37.800 --> 02:42.200
that's that's totally baseless other than the fact that I

02:43.280 --> 02:46.560
Just feel that not a lot of people are buying the core system

02:46.560 --> 02:50.880
And there's some other stories that kind of collaborate that later in the show wait a minute

02:50.880 --> 02:55.200
So I don't understand how that works how what about all the systems that are already out there?

02:55.200 --> 02:59.600
Are they gonna be coming off the shelves to make room for these HDMI enabled machines or what's gonna happen?

02:59.600 --> 03:06.560
No, it's just they'll have this extra SKU out there, and I don't know maybe they'll drop the price even more

03:07.360 --> 03:12.120
Huh very interesting so it's gonna have all HDMI on it so now

03:12.120 --> 03:17.360
I was that to be competitive with PlayStation 3 or is that because too many people were bitching about the elites

03:17.480 --> 03:22.440
Is the only way to go to get that I mean if you think about it's not a big surprise because look at the you know

03:22.440 --> 03:23.560
halo

03:23.560 --> 03:26.440
3 system I mean that's supposed to be coming out in

03:27.440 --> 03:29.240
September here, and it's not a big surprise

03:29.240 --> 03:34.240
That's why they haven't announced the price for that yet if you think about it because you know people be like well

03:34.240 --> 03:39.680
Hey, you know isn't that supposed to if they announced it like 399 or something or 349 or whatever?

03:39.680 --> 03:46.600
People say hey, why would I want to buy a premium system like buy the halo one for you know the same price with?

03:47.240 --> 03:51.120
HDMI now Alex Silvara in chat has a very excellent point

03:51.120 --> 03:53.840
I was thinking the same thing when I first heard this is that hmm

03:53.840 --> 03:57.760
I need to figure out how to red-ring my premium so I can get an HDMI model a

03:58.760 --> 04:00.240
hammer

04:00.240 --> 04:06.000
No, but seriously like you know could you use that warranty to your advantage like somehow for sure 360 to give you the red rings

04:06.040 --> 04:08.160
So when they send you a refurb it has HDMI

04:08.160 --> 04:11.640
well, you could wrap a towel around it and

04:13.520 --> 04:17.720
You know play it in another try to overheat it place it in an oven

04:19.200 --> 04:24.880
No, but I don't know what I'm not recommending that you do that, but you know I'm just saying

04:26.000 --> 04:30.320
And no one this is not a real big deal because you know the systems are out there right now

04:30.320 --> 04:33.680
They don't have HDMI, but who cares I mean I guess

04:33.680 --> 04:39.200
It sucks if you already bought one, but you know for like a person like me. I don't have any HDMI TV

04:39.200 --> 04:43.760
I could care less so I know is HDMI really that big a deal

04:43.760 --> 04:48.720
I mean because I have a feeling the Internet's gonna make this story this week and sound like this big huge

04:48.720 --> 04:54.000
Frickin deal other thing is it I'm guessing it will not have an HDMI cable with it either

04:54.160 --> 04:59.000
But the reason why is because there will be a cable. It's coming out as well all this is gonna be

04:59.480 --> 05:03.080
You'll probably all know this by the time you hear the pod yes

05:03.080 --> 05:10.720
So hmm you know because it also of course there was that GameStop thing the leak to the internet that said you know the

05:10.840 --> 05:15.040
announcements gonna be made by the 8th or Wednesday, so

05:17.080 --> 05:19.480
Yeah Wow not a big surprise, but

05:20.400 --> 05:25.560
Well, you know this kind of supplements what Loki was saying earlier about possibly the core is going away completely

05:26.480 --> 05:27.680
apparently

05:27.680 --> 05:35.040
Xbox there's rumors going around that Microsoft has plans to make a hard disk drive a requirement to play games in other words that think

05:35.040 --> 05:39.720
One Sega game a little while back had a long time ago. It was seeing a more game. It was on

05:40.400 --> 05:44.720
Yeah, Sega Pro soccer or something or other out some soccer

05:45.760 --> 05:51.120
Sim thing well that the hard disk drive will actually be required for some later games

05:51.640 --> 05:54.280
That was on the early pack shot to for Call of Duty 4

05:54.280 --> 05:58.720
They now you might remember that the original Xbox they all had hard drives

05:58.720 --> 06:02.200
And they would use the hard drive to their advantage it would take data off the disk

06:02.440 --> 06:06.580
Uncompress it and then put it on the HD H drive hard drive temporarily

06:06.920 --> 06:08.840
And so basically the loading times are smaller

06:08.840 --> 06:15.440
And if you've ever played oblivion without a hard drive versus with a hard drive very similar type of concept there of course no official

06:15.440 --> 06:17.800
announcement announcement from Microsoft as of yet

06:17.800 --> 06:25.120
But rumors are around and Microsoft rumors usually end up to be true usually unless it's like completely off-base

06:25.640 --> 06:30.480
But I wouldn't see this as being completely off-base. I could I could see this being a reality yeah

06:30.480 --> 06:30.960
I mean

06:30.960 --> 06:35.200
I don't know many Xbox 360 owners without a hard drive unless they are seriously only

06:35.440 --> 06:39.160
Buying a 360 for Madden or only buying it for select games

06:39.160 --> 06:48.160
You know very very casual types of 360 gamers any I think hardcore gamer with a 360 probably has a hard drive. Yeah

06:49.640 --> 06:53.880
So also this week you know that was very sorry

06:53.880 --> 06:56.440
I just want to go chat really really quick because some good points here

06:56.600 --> 07:04.120
Ross deal UT says of course Final Fantasy 11 another very big game that requires a hard drive on the Xbox 360 of course hello

07:04.120 --> 07:10.200
I wonder doc Harold would like to point out HDMI is a big deal when you spend $2,000 on the TV

07:11.960 --> 07:14.320
Raving he bought a TV that was like $2,000

07:15.040 --> 07:19.000
Ravens dolphin says orange on its radio enforces bricking Xbox 360s

07:19.000 --> 07:19.240
No

07:19.240 --> 07:25.640
We do not encourage you to break your 360s because there's no guarantee you're gonna get one replaced with HDMI

07:25.840 --> 07:29.800
Son of dad is being very bold says HDMI is a big deal for snobs

07:29.800 --> 07:37.080
Hmm the other thing I'd like to mention though that table Rockstar table tennis bundle. That's out there

07:37.200 --> 07:39.680
It's not the first time we've seen that actually

07:40.560 --> 07:44.820
Around January of this year. There's a few retailers out there

07:44.820 --> 07:50.640
This was offered to retailers as a way to sell systems, and it wasn't the only one fact

07:50.640 --> 07:57.000
I double-checked it on the ad that I saw and the part numbers match exactly so

07:57.000 --> 08:02.240
There's three different skews that they have they have Rockstar's table tennis top spin to

08:02.440 --> 08:07.600
Which both of those have kind of leaked out on the internet now and amp 3 was the last one that they had that

08:07.800 --> 08:11.600
I didn't see anyone having that but then again the games out of print also, so

08:12.440 --> 08:16.520
It wouldn't surprise me though if they maybe Ridge Racer. That'd be kind of cool

08:16.520 --> 08:20.440
But those three I know were being sold in January as well

08:20.440 --> 08:25.520
So that's probably also why that the one that they did leak with top spin to I think

08:25.520 --> 08:27.320
Had a price of $3.99

08:27.320 --> 08:32.080
Because that's the old skew um and and three those kind of an old game though

08:32.080 --> 08:37.960
I mean it is see that being super popular it is, but I mean top spin to I mean I'm not really

08:38.480 --> 08:40.480
Tennis yay

08:40.480 --> 08:45.520
Top spin game wasn't even that great topspin to wasn't even that great. I do like really games

08:45.520 --> 08:47.520
I didn't like that one, so sorry to say

08:48.400 --> 08:52.120
Now this is kind of interesting because you remember last week or two weeks ago

08:52.120 --> 08:55.600
We were here back back here on the show we were talking about halo on the DS

08:55.600 --> 08:58.120
We talked about like how Microsoft games could they really come out for the DS

08:58.120 --> 09:00.640
And I think even one of the emails are gonna get to later gets into this

09:00.640 --> 09:06.720
But it should be noted that at comic-con during a viva pinata panel of both things all things

09:06.720 --> 09:08.720
Did you go to the viva pinata panel at comic-con?

09:08.720 --> 09:17.200
She totally didn't I figured rare has actually announced. They are going to be releasing a Nintendo DS version of viva pinata

09:17.200 --> 09:22.240
So kind of interesting they're rare is actually developing it developing it themselves

09:22.240 --> 09:24.880
It's not a copy of the Xbox 360 game. It's different

09:25.480 --> 09:29.240
Gameplay wise they say it's the same game, but it is going to be a different game

09:29.760 --> 09:36.200
So kind of interesting because that's weird because rare is obviously a Microsoft subsidiary now

09:36.200 --> 09:37.960
And now they're putting out a game on the Nintendo DS

09:37.960 --> 09:44.200
But at the same time it makes a lot of sense if Xbox is not getting into the handheld realm anytime soon lots of kids

09:44.200 --> 09:49.320
Have Nintendo DS's and viva pinata of course is not just a game on the 360, but a cartoon series

09:49.320 --> 09:55.200
So you know they're trying to draw in the kids and make it like a new Pokemon type thing so I'm wondering who's my who's

09:55.200 --> 10:00.040
Gonna be publishing this game is it gonna be Microsoft because that would be interesting if it's Microsoft

10:00.560 --> 10:05.040
Publishing it or if it's actually gonna be rare developing it and Nintendo publishing it

10:05.680 --> 10:07.160
Who knows?

10:07.160 --> 10:11.400
Who knows I don't think it says here. I go. I guess it says the the

10:11.400 --> 10:15.560
Article says it sounds like Microsoft is publishing it, but I don't think we know that for sure just yet

10:15.560 --> 10:17.560
And I could be wrong though

10:19.240 --> 10:21.240
Anyways

10:21.640 --> 10:30.200
So another thing also that's very interesting kind of little weird the new X&A package for PC

10:30.680 --> 10:33.560
You might remember Microsoft's kind of game development kit

10:34.280 --> 10:38.600
Actually has support for Wiimotes for inputs for using that

10:38.600 --> 10:43.880
So that's a little interesting that you can make gestured controlled games for windows-based

10:44.840 --> 10:46.840
PCs

10:47.480 --> 10:53.720
Wait so I mean because people with XNA can play these games that they make on their Xbox 360 correct

10:54.040 --> 10:57.160
Yeah, so in other words people are gonna be able now

10:57.160 --> 11:02.680
They're gonna have viva vignette on the DS and they can build games that use the wiimotes not necessarily

11:02.680 --> 11:09.720
They have different libraries for both the PC and the 360 so it's not gonna allow you to play

11:09.720 --> 11:11.720
You know Wii games are like, you know

11:12.520 --> 11:16.920
Games that use the Wii remote on your Xbox 360, but you can play them on your PC

11:16.920 --> 11:20.040
Oh, that makes sense because I was gonna say how can you plug in that infrared bar?

11:20.040 --> 11:24.680
You can't it just it's just the wiimote and the sensors that are in that the accelerometers

11:24.680 --> 11:29.960
No, I really need to plug in the bar anyways, because it's just two infrared lights. I guess that's true

11:29.960 --> 11:33.880
That's still kind of interesting, but it doesn't have bluetooth on it

11:33.880 --> 11:38.600
So, you know, it'd be a little hard to connect those we remotes to the system

11:39.240 --> 11:44.360
Ross deal UT in our chairwoman like to point out Microsoft is published for DS before there was a mech assault game for it

11:45.320 --> 11:51.080
So there you go and Ross do UT also says this only proves that Microsoft is smart enough to stay the fuck away from the portable

11:51.080 --> 11:53.080
Market, there you go

11:53.640 --> 11:55.240
Ravens dolphin says it's a fair trade

11:55.240 --> 12:00.120
They get viva pinata and they get wiimote but that's not I mean to say Microsoft is getting the wiimote

12:00.120 --> 12:07.400
That's that's a little bit jumping to conclusions because I think it's this is a very minor thing and it's not like XNA games

12:07.400 --> 12:13.240
I don't think we've seen anything made in XNA actually go to the marketplace yet unless that what about that?

12:13.240 --> 12:18.280
What was it a Aegis wing? Was that an XNA game the one they give out for free? Yeah

12:18.680 --> 12:22.200
So that's like the only one though that I can think of that actually is coming

12:22.200 --> 12:28.520
It's just that's the first one, but I don't think you're gonna just like see suddenly a random game that requires wiimotes

12:29.400 --> 12:33.240
For the exact reason the Loki brought up before it's only really gonna work on the PC

12:34.120 --> 12:37.880
It's just kind of interesting. I mean, there's really no other word for it that I can think of

12:37.880 --> 12:40.520
It's just interesting that these worlds are colliding like this

12:41.720 --> 12:43.720
So go figure

12:43.960 --> 12:49.640
Let's see also interesting is a release that's coming out in Japan. It's getting Japan

12:49.640 --> 12:55.480
All prepped for halo 3 because of course halo 3, you know, it's gonna be a big deal in this country, but in Japan

12:56.680 --> 12:59.480
You know, I haven't taught the Amazon list at one point

12:59.480 --> 13:03.880
I think I think it's I think it is doing pretty well in Japan. It's doing it's doing well over there

13:03.880 --> 13:07.640
But it's not quite I mean, it's not quite the phenomenon that it is over here. You know what I mean?

13:07.640 --> 13:10.600
Like, you know, we'll get in some other stuff regarding halo 3 later

13:10.600 --> 13:11.960
That's kind of weird

13:11.960 --> 13:17.320
But we should say this that what is coming out in Japan for roughly the equivalent of 25 years

13:17.320 --> 13:23.640
US is a history pack. It's the halo history pack. It's halo and halo 2

13:24.200 --> 13:27.080
And they're releasing obviously these were xbox games

13:27.640 --> 13:33.960
But they are gonna release them in Japan, I guess with discs that have built-in backwards compatibility updates on them. So

13:34.680 --> 13:37.320
You can just can pop them in the xbox 360s in Japan

13:37.480 --> 13:41.880
And I guess the thought is that maybe this will you know get some hype going for halo 3 so

13:41.880 --> 13:46.920
Kind of interesting that this is coming out but pretty cool a really a really good deal

13:47.080 --> 13:52.040
I think the games are more expensive over here still I think halo 3 still set you back or halo 2

13:52.280 --> 13:57.480
Still set you back at least 30 bucks or at least 20 bucks each. I think at least so not a bad deal

13:57.480 --> 14:03.000
It's still a good deal. I wouldn't be surprised if we see something like that over here. I don't know why they wouldn't but whatever

14:04.920 --> 14:08.760
What is very weird by the way, they can all hear you eating on the stream right now

14:08.760 --> 14:13.240
Very professional. All right. Well, I'm not eating right now. So, huh. I'm done eating

14:14.920 --> 14:17.320
Anywho there's gonna be

14:18.840 --> 14:24.760
Halo 3 pre-orders are like everywhere including 7-eleven now. Yes, you can go buy a

14:25.800 --> 14:27.800
Slurpee or I guess a a

14:29.240 --> 14:33.160
You know simpson themed item and you can also pre-order halo 3

14:33.160 --> 14:39.320
Why well where there's money to be made. I mean you don't think of 7-eleven as being a big

14:39.880 --> 14:45.000
Video game sales chain, but let's face it. I mean lots of people want to buy halo 3

14:45.480 --> 14:50.680
Not everybody's gonna want to deal with the crowds at Best Buy or GameStop or whatever. So why not 7-eleven?

14:51.000 --> 14:56.200
I mean why if they can turn a profit from bringing a small amount of video games into their store? Why not? Right?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I guess

14:59.000 --> 15:03.240
It's just weird because you don't usually think of 7-eleven as a place to go get your games

15:03.240 --> 15:07.240
But honestly if that's a nationwide thing is having confirmed to be nationwide. What's going on?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.240
I don't know franchise to franchise

15:09.880 --> 15:15.480
I would think probably franchise the franchise but um, they did that around here. I might seriously consider it

15:15.480 --> 15:20.520
I mean who else is gonna pre-order it freaking I always thought 7-eleven is a place to go play street fighter 2

15:21.000 --> 15:26.040
DJ dark knight says they sold halo 2 at 7-eleven 2 apparently a lot of people are

15:26.040 --> 15:30.040
Forgetting about that

15:30.040 --> 15:36.040
Bandit says the weekend again all these comments coming from our live chat room chat dot orange launch rate calm

15:36.040 --> 15:40.040
Bandit says the week halo 3 comes out so many 7-elevens are gonna get robbed

15:40.040 --> 15:42.040
so many of them

15:42.040 --> 15:46.040
And JV Mon says didn't 7-eleven have the Wii price and a contest ad once

15:46.040 --> 15:50.040
Sorta, but that was a contest contests are different. I would think hmm

15:50.040 --> 15:56.040
Um, alex selvara says since they turned 7-elevens into quickie marts, maybe turn a few into pillars of autumn

15:56.040 --> 16:00.040
There you go. Turn them into some halo themed stores there. That could be a interesting and expensive

16:00.040 --> 16:06.040
Very expensive and ridiculous. Yeah, it would be a little bit ridiculous. Where the hell am I?

16:06.040 --> 16:10.040
Uh, there's a brand new xbox 360 repair website

16:10.040 --> 16:16.040
If you had your on over in your browser in internet explorer or firefox to service dot xbox

16:16.040 --> 16:22.040
dot com. There's a brand new site just set up pretty much to deal with the red rings of death and other things

16:22.040 --> 16:24.040
Related to xbox 360 failures

16:24.040 --> 16:28.040
It's all automated now and it's probably to reduce the stress on those poor call center reps

16:28.040 --> 16:30.040
I have to take all your angry calls

16:30.040 --> 16:36.040
You can register your console on the site schedule the repairs and keep track of them all through the website and the site

16:36.040 --> 16:42.040
Will also give you a five dollar discount just in case your xbox 360 is outside of warranty

16:42.040 --> 16:48.040
Like if it's not related to the red rings of death or whatever, um, since i'm sure that's money that's being saved

16:48.040 --> 16:52.040
On the customer service end from not having to actually talk to you

16:54.040 --> 17:00.040
Whoo five dollar discount off of like 150 bucks to repair that thing. That's a little ridiculous

17:02.040 --> 17:06.040
This is extremely sad news for me

17:06.040 --> 17:12.040
Um, grand theft auto 4 has been delayed to next year

17:12.040 --> 17:18.040
I I cannot tell you the utter disappointment that i've had. Um

17:18.040 --> 17:24.040
I know at work all of our grand theft auto group very disappointed

17:24.040 --> 17:28.040
But I guess the reason was just wasn't done yet

17:28.040 --> 17:32.040
Big game want to make sure it's you know, perfect

17:32.040 --> 17:38.040
And they just can't get done. So, you know, but uh outside of you the general consensus

17:38.040 --> 17:42.040
I'm feeling from the internet blogs and the internet websites is it's okay

17:42.040 --> 17:48.040
Now we have more time to play the other games that are all coming out this holiday season as well. Like it's more halo time

17:48.040 --> 17:54.040
It's more mass effect time. It's more, you know, whatever the hell you're playing netroid prime, whatever

17:54.040 --> 17:56.040
Now if you gotta look at this very interesting though

17:56.040 --> 18:02.040
I mean this actually I think hurts sony because if you look at it sony for you know

18:02.040 --> 18:08.040
First party titles and stuff coming out in the fall. They had like heavenly sword lair

18:08.040 --> 18:12.040
um ratchet and clank future and

18:12.040 --> 18:18.040
You know, I guess sing star or not. I have judgment. I mean those aren't I mean heavenly sword

18:18.040 --> 18:22.040
It's gonna be awesome and lair is gonna be pretty awesome and then ratchet and clank

18:22.040 --> 18:28.040
You know, definitely a good game, but those don't sell systems grand theft auto 4 would sell systems

18:28.040 --> 18:32.040
And I know it's ridiculous because yeah, it's coming out in the 360 as well

18:32.040 --> 18:38.040
But still, you know, some people are sony loyalists and they will buy their system when there really is something about that

18:38.040 --> 18:44.040
PlayStation name that is going to keep a lot of people with playstation, but here's the thing now that it's not coming out

18:44.040 --> 18:46.040
People are going to start thinking hey

18:46.040 --> 18:52.040
You know, I just can't wait anymore and you know now you've got halo 3 coming out

18:52.040 --> 18:58.040
It's gonna sell even more now that there's nothing competing with it, you know, at least around that same time and you know

18:58.040 --> 19:04.040
Plus microsoft has a really strong lineup for the fall. I mean shit that's gonna really hurt them

19:04.040 --> 19:10.040
I mean granted the game is gonna still sell like crazy when it comes out because now there's gonna be nothing competing with it

19:10.040 --> 19:12.040
but

19:12.040 --> 19:18.040
That's still more time and less units out there for sony and that's also more opportunity for them to lose

19:18.040 --> 19:21.040
Even more exclusives if they can't have a good holiday season

19:21.040 --> 19:28.040
What about the rumors that it's the the part of the reason of the delay is the playstation 3 development and that it's coding problems

19:28.040 --> 19:32.040
Um, somebody just brought that up in chat and also I remember reading that somewhere, but I don't know

19:32.040 --> 19:36.040
There's there's part of me that felt that that was a little bit fanboy ish. Like I didn't know whether to pump it or not

19:36.040 --> 19:37.040
I don't know if it's true or not

19:37.040 --> 19:43.040
I mean I could see it because there are a lot of games lately from all different publishers and all different developers

19:43.040 --> 19:48.040
That have been delayed on the playstation 3 end because it is hard to develop for they're not used to it

19:48.040 --> 19:53.040
They're used to developing for the 360 and you know, just developing for the cell is a lot harder

19:53.040 --> 19:59.040
So it's possible. I don't think it's true, but I just think the game was just not done

19:59.040 --> 20:02.040
It was a pretty aggressive deadline there

20:02.040 --> 20:08.040
They're trying to meet and you know, they probably just want to make sure it's perfect because the game is gonna be open to a crap load of scrutiny, right?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.040
Hell yeah

20:09.040 --> 20:11.040
So especially from our very own Loki

20:11.040 --> 20:12.040
Hell yeah

20:12.040 --> 20:16.040
All right. Well, you know, that's not the only game to get delayed

20:16.040 --> 20:19.040
I know probably not quite as many of you were looking forward to this

20:19.040 --> 20:25.040
Opened up to say that black site area 51, of course area 51 being one of their popular shooting games

20:25.040 --> 20:28.040
Well, this new area 51 is going to be a very popular game

20:28.040 --> 20:34.040
On PC PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 it has been bumped back to November 5th

20:34.040 --> 20:36.040
Which isn't a huge delay

20:36.040 --> 20:41.040
I mean, it's not like what we're looking at for the other games there, but it has been bumped back to November

20:41.040 --> 20:45.040
And funny enough, there's no demo for the PlayStation 3 yet on their service

20:45.040 --> 20:48.040
I think there was one supposed to be coming out later this month

20:48.040 --> 20:51.040
Possibly development issues

20:51.040 --> 20:54.040
And this there's another thing also too

20:54.040 --> 20:58.040
That we're forgetting about and I'm going to cover this right now

20:58.040 --> 21:04.040
There's another game delayed lair which is supposed to be coming out actually next week is now coming out in September 4th

21:04.040 --> 21:09.040
And the reason why it's being delayed is to enhance community features in the game

21:09.040 --> 21:15.040
Because if you remember lair is gonna be one of the first games that supports home in both the I guess their trophy system

21:15.040 --> 21:21.040
As well as you know being able to launch the game from home and stuff like that

21:21.040 --> 21:29.040
So some of these games also coming out in the fall may be delayed with some of those features in mind as well

21:29.040 --> 21:34.040
Interesting, so I mean that doesn't seem like that huge of a delay though

21:34.040 --> 21:37.040
I mean is that really enough time to kind of fix everything?

21:37.040 --> 21:39.040
I guess it is

21:39.040 --> 21:41.040
Strange

21:41.040 --> 21:45.040
Alright well we're going to get into the mailbag, we can't delay that anymore

21:45.040 --> 21:48.040
It's been two weeks coming and we want to get to your emails

21:48.040 --> 21:52.040
And hear from some of you folks and unfortunately dark soccer is not here tonight

21:52.040 --> 21:54.040
But filling in tonight for the mailbag is the one and only Miklotov

21:54.040 --> 21:59.040
Me

21:59.040 --> 22:02.040
So unfortunately we don't have the music tonight so I'll say

22:02.040 --> 22:06.040
I don't know how it goes which one is the mailbag

22:08.040 --> 22:10.040
Oh yeah we're used to seeing the song off scene

22:10.040 --> 22:14.040
Alright whatever get into the mailbag, who emailed us this week?

22:14.040 --> 22:19.680
Well, the first one is from Richard, I'm not going to say his last name because that might

22:19.680 --> 22:20.940
be inappropriate.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.940
You could use the last initial, I think that's okay, alright, thank you.

22:22.940 --> 22:28.940
M, the letter M, says, hey guys, I just felt like saying hi because you guys are so cool.

22:28.940 --> 22:32.340
It was a real bummer you didn't have a show last week.

22:32.340 --> 22:34.140
It feels like it's been longer though.

22:34.140 --> 22:38.780
Also, I just found my Golden Sun game and was wondering did you ever like playing it

22:38.780 --> 22:43.500
because it seriously, to me, lacks the information giving, meaning it doesn't always let me

22:43.500 --> 22:45.780
know where I need to go or do.

22:45.780 --> 22:49.880
And is the new Tales of game for PSP any good?

22:49.880 --> 22:52.000
And I already said who it was by, so I'm not going to say it again.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.540
And he needs to learn how to use commas because he used them incorrectly.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.540
Oh my god, it's just like having Jamie here.

22:57.540 --> 23:00.860
Shane's complaining about the grammar of the emails, this is amazing.

23:00.860 --> 23:01.860
I'm sorry.

23:01.860 --> 23:03.620
I honestly don't know a lot, I mean, Golden Sun.

23:03.620 --> 23:05.380
I played the crap out of Golden Sun, actually.

23:05.380 --> 23:07.300
Well, then you answer that.

23:07.300 --> 23:11.920
I loved it up until like, I put it down for two days and he's dead on where it doesn't

23:11.920 --> 23:14.180
tell you what you're supposed to do, ever.

23:14.180 --> 23:17.580
So putting it down for two days meant I couldn't play it anymore because I forgot what I was

23:17.580 --> 23:21.420
doing and there was nothing to help me figure out what I was doing, except for the internet.

23:21.420 --> 23:24.980
And I don't think I really used the internet much at that time when it came out.

23:24.980 --> 23:28.780
But yeah, it's a great game if you remember what you're doing or keep track of it.

23:28.780 --> 23:30.900
I don't know anything about Tales game.

23:30.900 --> 23:33.820
Loki, do you know anything about Tales game?

23:33.820 --> 23:39.460
There was a Tales game, got it.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.260
There's a new Tales game I know coming out.

23:41.260 --> 23:43.740
I haven't heard too much about it, though.

23:43.740 --> 23:47.820
I will try to read up on it very quickly while you read the next email.

23:47.820 --> 23:48.820
Look how long this is.

23:48.820 --> 23:49.820
Do I have to read it all?

23:49.820 --> 23:50.820
Yeah, just read it.

23:50.820 --> 23:51.820
Okay.

23:51.820 --> 23:55.780
This is from Scott L. Wait, crap, he has like a pseudonym at the bottom.

23:55.780 --> 23:56.860
Maybe I'll just wait till that.

23:56.860 --> 23:59.180
That's not from Scott L. at all.

23:59.180 --> 24:00.740
Okay.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.740
This is what it says.

24:01.740 --> 24:04.500
I'm bad at this, my god.

24:04.500 --> 24:11.180
Hey Yet Again, guys, was listening to this week's Part B and had a couple of responses.

24:11.180 --> 24:16.220
Number one, I had a 360 break on me with the disk scratching problem.

24:16.220 --> 24:20.900
This was one day after I bought it and had originally set it up on my coffee table while

24:20.900 --> 24:23.940
I made sure I had everything set up correctly.

24:23.940 --> 24:28.840
Once it was running smoothly, I gently picked it up to move it onto my entertainment center

24:28.840 --> 24:32.980
and next thing I knew, I heard a horrible loud grinding sound.

24:32.980 --> 24:38.680
I had only lifted it about an inch off the table and it, god, there's so much to read,

24:38.680 --> 24:41.340
but I had lifted it gently without tilting it at all.

24:41.340 --> 24:46.900
It not only ruined my disk, but when I put another disk in, and I don't want to read

24:46.900 --> 24:49.300
this anymore, this is really long and boring.

24:49.300 --> 24:55.140
Okay, the gist of what he's saying is it scratched that disk as well once he put another one

24:55.140 --> 24:57.380
in to test it.

24:57.380 --> 25:01.580
And he learns his error of his ways because- Exactly.

25:01.580 --> 25:05.640
Don't move the system while it's on.

25:05.640 --> 25:09.960
He says it was near the system's launch and he had no idea it would happen.

25:09.960 --> 25:15.500
He has had lots of machines that use his disks from PS1 on, as well as PCs, and I've never

25:15.500 --> 25:17.940
had this happen before when I moved them.

25:17.940 --> 25:22.540
He got a replacement and things have been smooth sailing at first, but he wanted to

25:22.540 --> 25:28.060
let everyone know that the disk scratching problem is a blatant fault in the 360 hardware

25:28.060 --> 25:30.660
and can happen without, or with the slightest movement.

25:30.660 --> 25:34.920
It doesn't require shaking or tilting it, even though it sounds like, you know, any

25:34.920 --> 25:39.060
sort of jostling, just picking it up is enough to break it.

25:39.060 --> 25:43.820
And the second thing he says is, you said Microsoft didn't make or license their titles

25:43.820 --> 25:44.820
to DS.

25:44.820 --> 25:46.220
Oh, we talked about this earlier.

25:46.220 --> 25:48.100
Yeah, did he bring up the same mech assault?

25:48.100 --> 25:50.180
Mech assault and Age of Empires.

25:50.180 --> 25:54.900
The chatter beat you to it just because the chat room comment came before the mailbag,

25:54.900 --> 25:55.900
sorry.

25:55.900 --> 25:58.260
Yeah, and then he talks about Halo.

25:58.260 --> 26:00.260
It's very boring.

26:00.260 --> 26:02.620
Cheers, y'all!

26:02.620 --> 26:03.620
Hero antagonist.

26:03.620 --> 26:05.860
You're the worst email reader ever.

26:05.860 --> 26:07.700
Did you see how long this is, though?

26:07.700 --> 26:09.740
It just kept going on and on.

26:09.740 --> 26:10.940
Yeah, then summarize.

26:10.940 --> 26:11.940
I did.

26:11.940 --> 26:12.940
I tried.

26:12.940 --> 26:17.040
All right, really quickly, the chat room has some comments here about the, where we did

26:17.040 --> 26:20.060
not know much about the Tales of series, our chat room fills in here.

26:20.060 --> 26:21.060
Hooray.

26:21.060 --> 26:25.980
Alex Silvera says, Tales of the world, Radiant mythology for the PSP, simply, it's awesome.

26:25.980 --> 26:27.180
Oh, that's right.

26:27.180 --> 26:28.280
That's the game that came out.

26:28.280 --> 26:32.260
And Zappy says, the PSP Tales of is a fan service for Tales of fan.

26:32.260 --> 26:35.060
There you go.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.060
Hooray.

26:36.060 --> 26:39.620
Next, email is from Rissimo.

26:39.620 --> 26:45.740
It says, hey guys, oh, by the way, I have to censor this because I don't cuss, so this

26:45.740 --> 26:46.740
should be interesting.

26:46.740 --> 26:50.780
Hey, guys, I've been a faithful listener for about a year and a half now.

26:50.780 --> 26:55.940
I've been in the chat room a few times, but I'm often too busy to listen to you live,

26:55.940 --> 26:58.340
so I just download the podcast to my PSP.

26:58.340 --> 27:03.020
I think the three of you offer so much to the gaming community and find it sad that

27:03.020 --> 27:07.700
many gamers that listen to podcasts haven't heard of you.

27:07.700 --> 27:08.700
The end.

27:08.700 --> 27:09.700
Stop it.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.020
Come on, keep going.

27:11.020 --> 27:15.900
I love the extreme sarcasm and angst that Jamie has, or that Jamie offers.

27:15.900 --> 27:21.500
Matt's rants are incredibly entertaining, and Rob is just too fracking adorable.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.940
I know you're moving.

27:22.940 --> 27:23.940
The word was fucking?

27:23.940 --> 27:24.940
Yes.

27:24.940 --> 27:25.940
Was that the word, Shane?

27:25.940 --> 27:26.940
That's one word.

27:26.940 --> 27:27.940
There's more.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.700
Hey, I'm adorable.

27:29.700 --> 27:30.700
That's great.

27:30.700 --> 27:36.220
I know you're moving the studio soon and just want to know about any possible changes.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.420
I really hope you guys add video.

27:38.420 --> 27:39.420
Please consider it.

27:39.420 --> 27:42.060
Loki, I agree with you on the zapper.

27:42.060 --> 27:45.180
Just try to homosexual your anger a little.

27:45.180 --> 27:47.740
I don't even know what that means.

27:47.740 --> 27:51.540
It's the fag your anger joke from like four weeks ago, of which we are noticing more and

27:51.540 --> 27:55.820
more iTunes reviews popping up saying that we need to learn how to fag our anger.

27:55.820 --> 27:56.820
That's stupid.

27:56.820 --> 27:57.820
You're stupid.

27:57.820 --> 28:00.460
Thanks for the oral pleasure, Rissimo.

28:00.460 --> 28:03.100
Hey, any time.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.300
There was no question in that one.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.300
Next.

28:06.300 --> 28:08.660
Hey, I don't mind a little ego email now and then.

28:08.660 --> 28:10.340
We're on the last email, everybody.

28:10.340 --> 28:11.340
Thank God.

28:11.340 --> 28:13.900
This one I read earlier, and I think it's interesting, and I'm probably going to do

28:13.900 --> 28:14.900
it at some point.

28:14.900 --> 28:15.900
All right.

28:15.900 --> 28:19.900
Hey, O-L-R. I know I'm a bit late, but it's been a hectic week.

28:19.900 --> 28:24.260
I just listened to the post E3 episode and wanted to make a short comment to the listener

28:24.260 --> 28:26.860
who was looking for more games for the blind.

28:26.860 --> 28:30.180
I recently heard of a game called Sound Voyager for the GBA.

28:30.180 --> 28:33.980
Unfortunately, it's an import only from Japan, but since it's handheld, it's region-free.

28:33.980 --> 28:39.220
Anyway, I've not played the game, but according to reviews, it's supposedly more enjoyable

28:39.220 --> 28:41.580
to play this game with your eyes closed.

28:41.580 --> 28:45.940
If you or anyone else is interested, now is a good time to pick it up from Playasia because

28:45.940 --> 28:48.180
it's on sale for $15.

28:48.180 --> 28:49.980
Those are all the bit generation games.

28:49.980 --> 28:51.980
I bought one of them, which I didn't like that one.

28:51.980 --> 28:52.980
Sound Voyager?

28:52.980 --> 28:53.980
No, it wasn't Sound Voyager.

28:53.980 --> 28:55.500
But, I mean, that's one of them.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.500
They had one.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.500
Yeah, that's one of them.

28:57.500 --> 29:03.060
It's generation two, I think, but they're awesome games for the Game Boy Advance.

29:03.060 --> 29:04.660
Just be careful.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.420
There's one I got colorists or whatever that's not very fun.

29:07.420 --> 29:09.020
I didn't really know how to play it.

29:09.020 --> 29:11.220
It ends with hope this helps some people out.

29:11.220 --> 29:12.220
Apollo.

29:12.220 --> 29:13.220
Hooray.

29:13.220 --> 29:15.260
That was a good email.

29:15.260 --> 29:16.260
That was.

29:16.260 --> 29:17.260
It's on a hat.

29:17.260 --> 29:18.260
It's helping listeners.

29:18.260 --> 29:19.260
Yeah.

29:19.260 --> 29:22.900
Unlike the one that was just complimenting you or the guy that writes too much.

29:22.900 --> 29:24.140
You're rude.

29:24.140 --> 29:25.140
All right.

29:25.140 --> 29:28.140
If you want to send an email, we promised Jamie you'll be back next week.

29:28.140 --> 29:30.580
She's just as mean as I am.

29:30.580 --> 29:31.580
Mailbag at Orange Laundry.

29:31.580 --> 29:33.220
Maybe we're going to have Loki read him.

29:33.220 --> 29:34.220
He's a little nicer.

29:34.220 --> 29:36.140
Who can we get in here that's nice to the listeners?

29:36.140 --> 29:37.340
I'm nice.

29:37.340 --> 29:41.340
Not when you have to write a whole crap about stuff that's not interesting.

29:41.340 --> 29:44.900
Mailbag at OrangeLaundryDo.com.

29:44.900 --> 29:48.220
And now it looks like a homosexual your anger might be the new catch line.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.100
I started something worse.

29:50.100 --> 29:52.780
I'm looking like what?

29:52.780 --> 29:54.900
Even what you had before.

29:54.900 --> 29:58.700
I don't understand how the last one makes sense, what you guys said, but I don't understand

29:58.700 --> 30:00.300
how this one makes even more sense.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.300
It was okay.

30:01.300 --> 30:05.460
It was that week that we speculated.

30:05.460 --> 30:07.600
We didn't know that the word was spastic.

30:07.600 --> 30:11.080
Some video game had the word spastic in it, and we speculated that the word was retarded

30:11.080 --> 30:14.060
because we didn't realize the cultural differences.

30:14.060 --> 30:17.460
So we were talking about the word retard and how it might not mean the same thing in Europe

30:17.460 --> 30:22.180
that it means here or whatever, and Loki said retard your anger because I guess it was a

30:22.180 --> 30:24.580
line in anger management or whatever.

30:24.580 --> 30:26.740
It's also like fire retardant, you know?

30:26.740 --> 30:27.740
Oh, okay.

30:27.740 --> 30:31.500
So then I was talking about how fag means something different here in America versus

30:31.500 --> 30:32.820
what it means in Europe, right?

30:32.820 --> 30:34.980
It's not quite the insult it is over there.

30:34.980 --> 30:39.500
So then Irene pops up and goes, hey, Loki, you need to fag your anger.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.500
And then it caught on.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.500
I don't know.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.100
That's terrible still.

30:43.100 --> 30:45.220
Didn't get any better hearing the story behind it.

30:45.220 --> 30:46.220
Sorry.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.220
It's okay.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.220
Just go.

30:48.220 --> 30:50.920
You know what's even worse is when like you talk on the live internet show about something

30:50.920 --> 30:54.540
that happened on the same live internet show, like just like five weeks ago, it wasn't even

30:54.540 --> 30:55.540
that long ago.

30:55.540 --> 30:58.740
It's probably still up for download.

30:58.740 --> 30:59.740
Don't give me that look.

30:59.740 --> 31:00.740
I'm going to talk.

31:00.740 --> 31:01.740
You're giving me that look.

31:01.740 --> 31:05.140
I'm looking at the internet.

31:05.140 --> 31:06.940
That Laura Roslin look of disapproval.

31:06.940 --> 31:07.940
I don't like it.

31:07.940 --> 31:08.940
I love Laura Roslin.

31:08.940 --> 31:11.420
I wanted to give her a hug at Comic-Con, but she was too far away.

31:11.420 --> 31:12.420
All right.

31:12.420 --> 31:15.220
Can we talk about something else, including sports games?

31:15.220 --> 31:18.500
We don't talk a whole lot about sports games here on the program, and we've gotten some

31:18.500 --> 31:22.420
feedback that says maybe we ought to talk a little more about sports games.

31:22.420 --> 31:24.380
Maybe if they were interesting, we would.

31:24.380 --> 31:27.740
Remember that whole you're an asshole thing we were talking about earlier?

31:27.740 --> 31:29.380
I like winning 11.

31:29.380 --> 31:30.380
There we go.

31:30.380 --> 31:31.380
Well, there you go.

31:31.380 --> 31:34.940
Do you like a major league baseball power pros?

31:34.940 --> 31:37.100
Oh, the Konami game.

31:37.100 --> 31:38.900
Well, it's Konami and 2K sports.

31:38.900 --> 31:39.900
That's what makes this interesting.

31:39.900 --> 31:41.900
The two of them are actually teaming up to put out the game.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.380
Oh, what system is it for?

31:43.380 --> 31:47.860
It is coming out for... That's a very good question.

31:47.860 --> 31:48.860
I haven't gotten there yet.

31:48.860 --> 31:49.860
Gosh.

31:49.860 --> 31:50.860
Nintendo Wii and some PlayStation 2.

31:50.860 --> 31:51.860
Yeah.

31:51.860 --> 31:52.860
I totally saw that in the office.

31:52.860 --> 31:53.860
It looked awesome.

31:53.860 --> 31:55.980
Are you even allowed to tell us that?

31:55.980 --> 31:57.260
What office is left?

31:57.260 --> 31:58.260
Oh, okay.

31:58.260 --> 32:00.260
I think it's out in the camera.

32:00.260 --> 32:01.260
Seriously.

32:01.260 --> 32:02.260
Can you tell us more?

32:02.260 --> 32:07.380
It was adorable because everybody had big heads and big eyes.

32:07.380 --> 32:08.380
It was pretty cool.

32:08.380 --> 32:09.380
I don't know.

32:09.380 --> 32:10.380
I just saw people playing it.

32:10.380 --> 32:11.380
It looked like fun.

32:11.380 --> 32:14.600
Well, the press release boasts that there's a dozen different game modes in the game.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.100
It's going to have long-term playability.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.500
It'll have, of course, a season mode as most sports games do.

32:19.500 --> 32:21.000
Success mode as well.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.720
In season mode, you become a major league baseball team general manager and, of course,

32:24.720 --> 32:25.780
what is the ultimate goal?

32:25.780 --> 32:27.660
To win the World Series.

32:27.660 --> 32:31.460
Success mode, though, has more traditional role-playing elements and other baseball scenarios

32:31.460 --> 32:32.460
in it.

32:32.460 --> 32:36.220
They're calling this mode unique and compelling, which, of course, press releases are supposed

32:36.220 --> 32:37.220
to talk about.

32:37.220 --> 32:39.860
I don't think it's either of those, but it did look like a lot of fun, so I would highly

32:39.860 --> 32:41.620
recommend it if you like baseball games.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.460
That's what it's really about.

32:43.460 --> 32:44.460
To some people.

32:44.460 --> 32:46.740
It's not going to be the graphics, that's for sure.

32:46.740 --> 32:51.340
See, and now there's people in chat going, no, don't talk about sports games, or Ravensdorf

32:51.340 --> 32:54.860
says Sky Talking Baseball makes me want to go kill myself.

32:54.860 --> 32:56.220
I love going to baseball games.

32:56.220 --> 32:58.420
I'm just saying the games are kind of boring as of late.

32:58.420 --> 33:00.580
It's cheapy and cute.

33:00.580 --> 33:02.120
Even I love baseball stars on the end.

33:02.120 --> 33:03.420
There's the occasional sports game that I will.

33:03.420 --> 33:05.480
Like the Ken Griffey games were really fun on the Super Nintendo.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.620
Or like Double Dribble.

33:06.620 --> 33:07.980
How can you not love NBA Jam?

33:07.980 --> 33:08.980
Hello.

33:08.980 --> 33:12.420
Yeah, but just because you don't play Madden doesn't mean you have to hate all sports games.

33:12.420 --> 33:13.420
Yeah, that's true.

33:13.420 --> 33:16.300
Madden is just a little hardcore for maybe some people that don't follow football.

33:16.300 --> 33:17.300
Yeah.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.300
Maybe it's a bit much.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.260
Football is fun to watch, but I don't understand it.

33:20.260 --> 33:22.860
If you play racing games, that's a sport.

33:22.860 --> 33:23.860
Hello.

33:23.860 --> 33:25.660
They tried to make DDR sport, guys.

33:25.660 --> 33:26.660
Come on.

33:26.660 --> 33:28.820
Well, that's a whole other, you know.

33:28.820 --> 33:30.540
But no, sports games can be good.

33:30.540 --> 33:34.620
And this one, you know, if you like baseball and you don't mind, you know, cute little

33:34.620 --> 33:36.620
things, it's going to be good.

33:36.620 --> 33:37.620
Yeah.

33:37.620 --> 33:38.620
Okay.

33:38.620 --> 33:39.980
Well, one thing that may be good.

33:39.980 --> 33:48.020
If you're holding out for All Pro Football 2K8, apparently sales of All Pro Football

33:48.020 --> 33:53.100
2K8 were okay, I guess.

33:53.100 --> 33:59.620
I guess 2K was not terribly pleased and not terribly disappointed.

33:59.620 --> 34:05.340
So the rumor is that it may be dropping price with the upcoming Madden release.

34:05.340 --> 34:10.260
So if it's going to drop price, that would probably be by next week then since, well,

34:10.260 --> 34:11.740
that's when Madden comes out.

34:11.740 --> 34:13.220
So I don't know.

34:13.220 --> 34:14.220
Looks pretty cool.

34:14.220 --> 34:18.580
I did see some funny videos, though, online of OJ Simpson.

34:18.580 --> 34:23.060
And there was this one team, I can't remember what it was, but they had a, one of their

34:23.060 --> 34:28.420
mascots was this guy with a knife and he was stabbing.

34:28.420 --> 34:29.420
It was funny.

34:29.420 --> 34:34.060
So the fun things you can do with All Pro Football.

34:34.060 --> 34:40.820
The OL Army Ninja in chat says, you guess a lot, Loki.

34:40.820 --> 34:42.060
I do.

34:42.060 --> 34:44.660
And I am right a lot as well.

34:44.660 --> 34:50.420
Now, okay, even if you, I know some of you guys may not care about the sports games,

34:50.420 --> 34:52.420
but I know you guys are ready for this.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.540
Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

34:54.540 --> 34:58.180
And Super Smash Brothers Brawl, of course, we know it's going to have, you know, huge

34:58.180 --> 35:00.020
multiplayer modes, battles.

35:00.020 --> 35:03.820
But single player mode, we got a little more information about this week.

35:03.820 --> 35:07.580
Personally the single player mode is going to be a bit more of a side scrolling action

35:07.580 --> 35:08.580
game.

35:08.580 --> 35:12.500
Now if you think back to Super Smash Brothers Melee, the single player was like awesome.

35:12.500 --> 35:16.540
Like you know, when you were playing some of those levels, like the first one that looked

35:16.540 --> 35:18.420
like the Mario Brothers level or whatever.

35:18.420 --> 35:21.780
Like I know a lot of people that were going, where is this game for the GameCube?

35:21.780 --> 35:24.680
Where is our Mario Brothers game that looks like this on the GameCube?

35:24.680 --> 35:27.500
And so I guess in Brawl they've taken it in another direction.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.700
Now it's like this whole side scrolling action game.

35:29.700 --> 35:33.060
And some people are comparing it to Kingdom Hearts, just because of the fact that you

35:33.060 --> 35:36.620
pull in all these characters from different universes, throw them in a blender and toss

35:36.620 --> 35:38.740
them into this one game.

35:38.740 --> 35:42.180
Here's a quote from the story, quote, we've managed to create a complete side scrolling

35:42.180 --> 35:43.260
action game.

35:43.260 --> 35:47.100
Its storyline isn't overwrought, it's hastened along by a bunch of quick movies.

35:47.100 --> 35:49.900
The adventure mode also empathizes character development.

35:49.900 --> 35:53.660
You'll see many famous characters persevering under the weight of their personal histories,

35:53.660 --> 35:56.020
shouldering their unique burdens.

35:56.020 --> 35:59.180
It's really something you won't see anywhere else.

35:59.180 --> 36:03.400
That sounds kind of cool because it sounds like it could be something that's all by itself.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.180
Go figure.

36:05.180 --> 36:07.540
Something else I want to say really quickly though, because I noticed it didn't make the

36:07.540 --> 36:08.820
show roll.

36:08.820 --> 36:12.340
There's some other information that hit the Smash Brothers dojo this week at SmashBrothers.com

36:12.340 --> 36:14.140
and that is another newcomer.

36:14.140 --> 36:15.460
It's Ike.

36:15.460 --> 36:19.580
And Ike you may have never heard of before, unless you play Fire Emblem, because Ike comes

36:19.580 --> 36:20.860
from the Fire Emblem series.

36:20.860 --> 36:25.260
He comes from I think the GameCube one, which probably sold about five copies.

36:25.260 --> 36:30.220
Well, whatever you feel about Fire Emblem, Ike is going to be one of the characters in

36:30.220 --> 36:31.220
the game.

36:31.220 --> 36:33.380
It's just like a character you'd have a crush on, Miklotov, actually.

36:33.380 --> 36:36.180
I totally do, because he's got blue hair.

36:36.180 --> 36:39.700
Well, hopefully the Wii version is going to sell a little bit more, because they do have

36:39.700 --> 36:41.940
the Wii one coming out in November here, so.

36:41.940 --> 36:42.940
That's true.

36:42.940 --> 36:45.740
Okay, Loki, I have a question for you, because Shane's going to yell at me if I say this.

36:45.740 --> 36:49.940
Loki, is his hair blue or purple?

36:49.940 --> 36:52.580
From here it looks kind of dark blue.

36:52.580 --> 36:53.940
Oh, it looks purple.

36:53.940 --> 36:55.140
Your eyes suck.

36:55.140 --> 36:57.220
It's purple to me.

36:57.220 --> 36:58.220
There's this inside.

36:58.220 --> 36:59.220
It's not even a joke.

36:59.220 --> 37:02.220
Do we want to explain to the listener?

37:02.220 --> 37:03.220
Miklotov can't see purple.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.220
It's indigo.

37:05.220 --> 37:07.020
I swear his hair is purple.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.300
Well, I'll fight you for it.

37:09.300 --> 37:10.300
It looks a little purple.

37:10.300 --> 37:11.300
It's blue-y purple.

37:11.300 --> 37:15.140
Well, I'll tell you what, well, I don't know.

37:15.140 --> 37:20.700
Another interesting thing, we've talked about this numerous times before, but the Neo Geo

37:20.700 --> 37:25.900
is coming to the Virtual Console, and now it is confirmed on Nintendo's Virtual Console

37:25.900 --> 37:27.860
website in Japan.

37:27.860 --> 37:36.100
They do show the Neo Geo there, and also have a spot for another console that's yet unnamed.

37:36.100 --> 37:37.100
Dreamcast.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.100
Commodore 64.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.100
Come on, Dreamcast.

37:39.100 --> 37:40.100
MSX.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.620
Commodore 64, remember that rumor a while back?

37:42.620 --> 37:43.620
Yeah.

37:43.620 --> 37:46.340
Like, wasn't, isn't there supposed to be like an Impossible Mission remake that was supposed

37:46.340 --> 37:51.440
to be one of the first games that's not just a direct port of something old?

37:51.440 --> 37:53.060
There's Impossible Mission.

37:53.060 --> 37:58.460
I do remember it's supposed to be coming out, and there's also Elevator Action, which is

37:58.460 --> 38:02.100
now called Spy Game Elevator Action.

38:02.100 --> 38:03.580
You know, I do and I don't want MSX.

38:03.580 --> 38:07.220
I mean, that would be great for the Japanese folks, but they're not going to take the time

38:07.220 --> 38:11.200
to translate any of those games into English for us over here, but can you imagine actually

38:11.200 --> 38:17.700
being able to play Gardic over here in America, the first game in the Guardian Legends series.

38:17.700 --> 38:21.520
And if you've listened to this show for any length of time, you know that I have a huge

38:21.520 --> 38:25.820
nerdgasm boner for the Guardian Legends on 8-bit systems.

38:25.820 --> 38:27.220
It's gross.

38:27.220 --> 38:29.920
But it's true.

38:29.920 --> 38:33.340
There's no games that you get that super excited about.

38:33.340 --> 38:34.340
Silent Hill.

38:34.340 --> 38:35.340
See?

38:35.340 --> 38:36.340
Pump It Up.

38:36.340 --> 38:37.340
That's gross.

38:37.340 --> 38:38.340
Whatever.

38:38.340 --> 38:39.340
Both of those games are amazing.

38:39.340 --> 38:40.340
You did see that there's a new Pump It Up coming again.

38:40.340 --> 38:41.340
It was.

38:41.340 --> 38:42.340
PSP.

38:42.340 --> 38:45.820
I actually was talking to Rob about that today, and I wanted to cry.

38:45.820 --> 38:48.640
And I was making fun of him, because the game will probably have his favorite Pump song

38:48.640 --> 38:49.640
of all time in it.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.120
It probably will, and it's really going to make me sad.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.120
Which for the record is Luzenka.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.120
Yes.

38:54.120 --> 38:55.120
Save Us.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.120
Luzenka, Save Us.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.120
I don't know if you like any of these songs.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.860
I mean, maybe Guitar Hero 3 will make you feel better, Miklotov.

38:59.860 --> 39:01.980
There is one song on there that does make me feel better.

39:01.980 --> 39:03.620
Oh, I'm curious to know what it is.

39:03.620 --> 39:09.700
There are some new songs that were just announced, and of course, it seems like whenever there's

39:09.700 --> 39:13.480
a new Guitar Heroes game, whether it's the 80s edition or the 3, it seems like the songs

39:13.480 --> 39:18.340
keep slowly rolling out to keep this game in the press.

39:18.340 --> 39:21.700
I will tell you no or yes when you read off the list.

39:21.700 --> 39:22.700
Miss Murder by A.I.

39:22.700 --> 39:23.700
No.

39:23.700 --> 39:24.700
Threes and Sevens by Queen in Stone Age.

39:24.700 --> 39:25.700
No.

39:25.700 --> 39:26.700
Raining Blood by Stare.

39:26.700 --> 39:27.700
No.

39:27.700 --> 39:28.700
Reptilia by The Strokes.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.700
No.

39:29.700 --> 39:30.700
Paranoid by Black Sabbath.

39:30.700 --> 39:31.700
No.

39:31.700 --> 39:32.700
Cities on Flame by Blue Ice or Cold.

39:32.700 --> 39:33.700
No.

39:33.700 --> 39:34.700
Mississippi Queen by Mountain.

39:34.700 --> 39:35.700
No.

39:35.700 --> 39:36.700
You didn't read enough of it.

39:36.700 --> 39:37.700
That's it.

39:37.700 --> 39:38.700
That's the seven new songs.

39:38.700 --> 39:42.820
That video was crazy.

39:42.820 --> 39:43.820
Through the Fire and Flames.

39:43.820 --> 39:44.820
Yes.

39:44.820 --> 39:45.820
Oh, my God.

39:45.820 --> 39:47.660
I don't know why.

39:47.660 --> 39:53.700
It does remind me stuff you'd see in Guitar Freaks and stuff, just the insanely fast...

39:53.700 --> 39:55.460
Made no sense, really.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.820
It's just like, oh, my God.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.820
I like Cherub Rock by the Smashing Pumpkins.

39:59.820 --> 40:00.900
That looks like it would be cool.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.380
Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones.

40:02.380 --> 40:03.380
That's kind of awesome.

40:03.380 --> 40:04.380
If they did Muzzle by...

40:04.380 --> 40:05.380
Sabotage by Beastie Boys.

40:05.380 --> 40:06.380
Hey, this is my bad.

40:06.380 --> 40:07.380
I don't like the Beastie Boys.

40:07.380 --> 40:08.380
Tenacious D songs in there.

40:08.380 --> 40:09.860
My Name is Jonas by Weezer.

40:09.860 --> 40:12.540
I'm still thinking that Rock Band's going to outdo this.

40:12.540 --> 40:16.100
From everything I understand, I'll probably buy them both because I'm such a whore for

40:16.100 --> 40:17.100
music games.

40:17.100 --> 40:18.100
I can admit it.

40:18.100 --> 40:19.100
I don't know.

40:19.100 --> 40:21.260
Have you seen footage of Guitar Hero 3 since Neversoft took it over?

40:21.260 --> 40:22.260
Yeah.

40:22.260 --> 40:23.260
It looks kind of weird.

40:23.260 --> 40:24.260
That's all right.

40:24.260 --> 40:26.860
DDR looked kind of weird when it went over to the Xbox, but you get used to it.

40:26.860 --> 40:30.860
Still kind of looks weird.

40:30.860 --> 40:33.940
I like how you can give us a more honest opinion now.

40:33.940 --> 40:36.100
I don't think I ever was not honest about how I felt about the game.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.540
I guess that's true, but it seems different now.

40:37.540 --> 40:39.980
What do you think about DDR Hottest Party?

40:39.980 --> 40:43.180
I think it's a piece of crap.

40:43.180 --> 40:46.580
Oh, man.

40:46.580 --> 40:50.080
I'm way too honest.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.300
We probably ought to move on to the next topic.

40:52.300 --> 40:53.300
Loki.

40:53.300 --> 40:59.380
Yeah, speaking of weird and kind of crappy, Guitar Hero.

40:59.380 --> 41:06.300
It's been spotted in the arcade, and it's actually, they had a wonderful shot of it

41:06.300 --> 41:07.860
on Kotaku.

41:07.860 --> 41:14.260
It was a game in a Bangkok arcade, and what's funny about it is there's no guitar.

41:14.260 --> 41:15.260
It's just Guitar Hero.

41:15.260 --> 41:19.100
Why are you giggling at him talking about a game in Bangkok if you don't have a perverted

41:19.100 --> 41:20.100
mind, Shane?

41:20.100 --> 41:21.100
No, I'm not laughing at that.

41:21.100 --> 41:22.140
I'll tell you later.

41:22.140 --> 41:24.320
Go on with your story.

41:24.320 --> 41:27.780
What's funny, though, is the whole game looks like popin' music.

41:27.780 --> 41:33.540
It's got basically giant buttons for each of the fret buttons, and I guess you play

41:33.540 --> 41:38.060
it a little bit like popin' music.

41:38.060 --> 41:44.460
One might say, though, it's kind of ripping off of Beatmania, so that's kind of ironic.

41:44.460 --> 41:48.420
So all you do is you just hit the buttons down, and that's like an automatic strumming,

41:48.420 --> 41:49.420
too?

41:49.420 --> 41:50.780
I don't know, but...

41:50.780 --> 41:51.780
It would just be popin' music.

41:51.780 --> 41:52.780
That's all it is.

41:52.780 --> 41:54.420
I was just saying, it's popin' music.

41:54.420 --> 41:55.420
Poppin' Hero.

41:55.420 --> 41:58.340
That's a terrible name.

41:58.340 --> 42:00.500
It sounds like a popcorn game.

42:00.500 --> 42:03.140
By the way, I just want to point out, this is what Shane's doing during the show.

42:03.140 --> 42:05.100
You know why he started laughing?

42:05.100 --> 42:07.280
It had nothing to do with the whole Bangkok thing.

42:07.280 --> 42:11.180
He's reading Big Brother 8 live updates and giggling at them, and the housemates calling

42:11.180 --> 42:13.140
each other dirty names.

42:13.140 --> 42:15.580
That's what really goes on here in the OLR studio.

42:15.580 --> 42:16.580
Whatever.

42:16.580 --> 42:17.580
Hey, don't get off topic.

42:17.580 --> 42:19.420
Continue with your video games discussion.

42:19.420 --> 42:21.380
Oh, okay, I will.

42:21.380 --> 42:23.740
So would you play Guitar Hero in the arcade if it was popin' music?

42:23.740 --> 42:27.500
I may try it once just to say that I played it, and that's about it.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.500
I like popin' in the arcade.

42:28.500 --> 42:29.500
It would be fun.

42:29.500 --> 42:30.500
It would be cool.

42:30.500 --> 42:35.580
I'm sure it's like playing Unjamma Lamy in the arcade, which I played one time.

42:35.580 --> 42:37.580
It was very strange.

42:37.580 --> 42:41.580
Like first off, it's made for little kids, so I had to like get on my knees to play this

42:41.580 --> 42:42.580
game.

42:42.580 --> 42:45.080
Shut up!

42:45.080 --> 42:50.180
But I like, you know, because I'm really tall, unlike little Asian girls, and I had to like,

42:50.180 --> 42:54.860
you know, squat down to play the, never mind, I'm not going to finish the story.

42:54.860 --> 42:58.780
Was it like trying to use like a little kid urinal or something like that?

42:58.780 --> 43:06.340
Like they did in Billy Madison, where he has to like squat down, he falls over.

43:06.340 --> 43:07.340
Let's see.

43:07.340 --> 43:11.180
Ross Steel UT says, you hit the buttons, isn't that every fucking rhythm game ever?

43:11.180 --> 43:12.180
Kinda.

43:12.180 --> 43:15.740
Hit them with your feet, hit them with your hands, hit them with the strumming, hit them

43:15.740 --> 43:16.740
with your voice.

43:16.740 --> 43:18.940
You can't hit buttons with your voice.

43:18.940 --> 43:19.940
Sorta.

43:19.940 --> 43:22.580
You can if you sing really bad.

43:22.580 --> 43:30.020
Some people say my voice pushes people's buttons.

43:30.020 --> 43:31.860
I love dead air.

43:31.860 --> 43:37.420
Moving on to another story, and this is a story that seems to come up every single week,

43:37.420 --> 43:41.860
but there's a website out there, Inner Bits, that is saying that developers have their

43:41.860 --> 43:46.860
dirty little hands on a six axis controller that rumbles.

43:46.860 --> 43:50.700
And yes, we've been hearing this story on and off, and Loki has been insisting for weeks

43:50.700 --> 43:55.540
and weeks that yes, this is coming, but apparently various Sony developers do have their hands

43:55.540 --> 43:57.820
on the six axis with rumble.

43:57.820 --> 44:02.660
Rumor is it could be their big announcement at the convention in Germany, the Leipzig

44:02.660 --> 44:03.660
convention.

44:03.660 --> 44:10.520
Congratulations for spending $499 on your brand new 60 gig PlayStation 3 system.

44:10.520 --> 44:14.380
Also congratulations, you're now gonna have to buy new controllers, thank you.

44:14.380 --> 44:16.060
What's also funny is they actually did come out and-

44:16.060 --> 44:17.060
Sure, why not?

44:17.060 --> 44:18.060
The same thing happened on PS1 and PS2.

44:18.060 --> 44:19.060
Oh yeah.

44:19.060 --> 44:20.060
Wait.

44:20.060 --> 44:22.940
But they didn't say rumble is last generation then.

44:22.940 --> 44:27.700
PS1 didn't have the little analog sticks to be analyzed, and PS2 didn't have rumble to

44:27.700 --> 44:28.700
begin with.

44:28.700 --> 44:29.700
I have a PS2 controller that doesn't have rumble.

44:29.700 --> 44:30.700
Really?

44:30.700 --> 44:31.700
Yes.

44:31.700 --> 44:32.700
I swear they had-

44:32.700 --> 44:33.700
I bought one at launch.

44:33.700 --> 44:34.700
It had rumble.

44:34.700 --> 44:36.820
Then why the fuck doesn't my PlayStation 2 controller rumble?

44:36.820 --> 44:37.820
Is it broken?

44:37.820 --> 44:38.820
No.

44:38.820 --> 44:39.820
I think it is.

44:39.820 --> 44:40.820
Are you sure it's a PlayStation 2 controller?

44:40.820 --> 44:41.820
I'm sure.

44:41.820 --> 44:42.820
It could be just an-

44:42.820 --> 44:43.820
A black PS1 controller?

44:43.820 --> 44:44.820
Yeah, they had those.

44:44.820 --> 44:45.820
Did they?

44:45.820 --> 44:46.820
Son of a bitch.

44:46.820 --> 44:48.580
Yeah, because I remember I bought mine at launch and-

44:48.580 --> 44:49.580
Yeah, I worked it.

44:49.580 --> 44:50.580
Oh my god.

44:50.580 --> 44:51.580
I failed.

44:51.580 --> 44:52.580
Jesus.

44:52.580 --> 44:58.420
I do remember having to buy the DualShock controllers at one time, so yeah, that makes sense.

44:58.420 --> 45:03.860
But this is something that they took away and now they're putting back.

45:03.860 --> 45:07.860
But they said they justified taking away, because it was a last generation feature.

45:07.860 --> 45:08.860
Oh, okay.

45:08.860 --> 45:10.420
Because rumble is so last gen.

45:10.420 --> 45:12.900
Welcome to last gen, Sony.

45:12.900 --> 45:15.980
They're all, well, last gen sold better than this gen, so let's go back.

45:15.980 --> 45:18.020
I think that's what they're doing.

45:18.020 --> 45:25.020
They're like, maybe if we can just make it like the PS2, it'll sell.

45:25.020 --> 45:30.900
Anyways, so another interesting thing, Warhawk is finally, the price point has been announced.

45:30.900 --> 45:35.300
We knew before that the retail version was going to be $59.99, and that was going to

45:35.300 --> 45:41.020
include a Bluetooth headset, as well as some extra bonus behind the scenes crap.

45:41.020 --> 45:46.420
And now the online version, probably the most expensive download I think you'll ever see

45:46.420 --> 45:53.700
on a console, well, so far at least, is $39.99 to download this game.

45:53.700 --> 45:55.380
You thought Luminous was expensive.

45:55.380 --> 46:01.340
Well, actually, if you add it up, if you add up the game itself and then all the fucking

46:01.340 --> 46:04.100
little packs they have with it, maybe it's getting close.

46:04.100 --> 46:05.660
It's probably about $25.

46:05.660 --> 46:07.140
That's before we even get to packs.

46:07.140 --> 46:10.820
I mean, what makes you think that Warhawk's not going to have downloadable content?

46:10.820 --> 46:12.820
Good point, good point.

46:12.820 --> 46:14.780
Alright, so are you going to buy this though?

46:14.780 --> 46:15.780
Nope.

46:15.780 --> 46:20.980
I have, I do not like online only multiplayer games.

46:20.980 --> 46:21.980
That's true.

46:21.980 --> 46:22.980
No more MMOs.

46:22.980 --> 46:23.980
That's what turned me off to...

46:23.980 --> 46:24.980
MMOs are different.

46:24.980 --> 46:29.700
This is just like straight, you know, online only multiplayer.

46:29.700 --> 46:31.480
It feels like half a game to me.

46:31.480 --> 46:35.780
It's like taking the online portion of your single player first person shooter and just,

46:35.780 --> 46:40.820
well, we didn't feel like creating this story, so let's just make the game.

46:40.820 --> 46:45.060
Okay, the chat room is all like saying, you know, and I appreciate the chat room and their

46:45.060 --> 46:50.740
comments, but they're all like, Sky, have you turned on the rumble and the various games?

46:50.740 --> 46:52.700
Give me a little credit here, people.

46:52.700 --> 46:57.100
I mean, okay, I've been doing an internet radio program about video games with my friends

46:57.100 --> 46:58.340
for five years.

46:58.340 --> 47:02.360
Okay, give me a little bit of the benefit of the doubt that I know how to turn these

47:02.360 --> 47:06.820
features on and games and check and see, you know, all this stuff.

47:06.820 --> 47:10.120
I realize I'm not perfect and I don't get things right all the time.

47:10.120 --> 47:12.100
We're human, but please.

47:12.100 --> 47:16.380
I'm trying to remember if yours even has the little button in the middle to turn on.

47:16.380 --> 47:18.500
It does.

47:18.500 --> 47:19.500
And we're back, folks.

47:19.500 --> 47:20.500
Sorry about that.

47:20.500 --> 47:21.500
We don't know what happened.

47:21.500 --> 47:22.500
I can tell you what happened.

47:22.500 --> 47:25.180
This Skype mess with the settings there.

47:25.180 --> 47:27.500
Well, live radio, boys and girls, we're in the temporary studio.

47:27.500 --> 47:28.560
What can you do?

47:28.560 --> 47:29.560
These things happen.

47:29.560 --> 47:31.940
Now, I don't know what the last thing the folks heard was, though, before we went to

47:31.940 --> 47:32.940
the Skype line.

47:32.940 --> 47:35.180
So quickly give us the last story again real quick there.

47:35.180 --> 47:36.180
Sorry, folks.

47:36.180 --> 47:37.180
Live radio, things happen.

47:37.180 --> 47:38.180
The last story?

47:38.180 --> 47:39.180
Like, which story?

47:39.180 --> 47:42.380
The story about the start of the read?

47:42.380 --> 47:43.380
Okay.

47:43.380 --> 47:48.340
So we were going to cover one story that we ran on the website about the Tokyo game show

47:48.340 --> 47:49.860
list for Sega.

47:49.860 --> 47:52.260
That makes me sad.

47:52.260 --> 47:53.860
And that looks really awesome.

47:53.860 --> 47:55.660
It's such a wonderful list.

47:55.660 --> 47:58.460
Even like, Fighters Megamix 2 and stuff, I was like, oh, hell yeah.

47:58.460 --> 48:00.460
New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio.

48:00.460 --> 48:02.540
New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio, yeah.

48:02.540 --> 48:03.540
Guess what?

48:03.540 --> 48:04.540
It's fake.

48:04.540 --> 48:08.340
Because it was too much of a Sega fanboy's dream.

48:08.340 --> 48:10.060
And we posted that on our website.

48:10.060 --> 48:11.060
Yes.

48:11.060 --> 48:12.060
Awesome job.

48:12.060 --> 48:13.060
Awesome job, everybody.

48:13.060 --> 48:15.020
Now, how did it get debunked?

48:15.020 --> 48:19.740
The original source actually has posted a retraction and apology.

48:19.740 --> 48:24.900
So saying we lied because we made all of those up because people wanted to hear that.

48:24.900 --> 48:27.740
Yeah, so they are a big douche, apparently.

48:27.740 --> 48:35.660
It says, let's see, it says there has been a lot of controversy regarding the recently

48:35.660 --> 48:39.140
posted rumor regarding Sega's possible Tokyo game show lineup.

48:39.140 --> 48:44.540
Now, I was originally very defensive of this piece and because of who sent it in, his long

48:44.540 --> 48:52.500
time go-to guy named Rob, Rob, what did you do, has sent me exclusive tips of four years

48:52.500 --> 48:57.540
and until this most recent one, all were accurate.

48:57.540 --> 49:05.020
And apparently, Rob says, sorry guys, says that I'm sorry for this whole damn mess.

49:05.020 --> 49:07.660
I assure you that this will not happen again.

49:07.660 --> 49:10.660
I have to say I applaud you guys for being right on top of this.

49:10.660 --> 49:12.820
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

49:12.820 --> 49:16.900
I think really some of those games sounded plausible up until you hit Shenmue 3.

49:16.900 --> 49:21.820
I can tell you one thing, though, that will be a Tokyo game show this year.

49:21.820 --> 49:27.420
I don't know if you can get excited about this or not, but a new Sonic Riders game,

49:27.420 --> 49:29.580
Sonic Riders Zero Gravity will be there.

49:29.580 --> 49:33.900
It's coming out on the Wii and PlayStation 2, actually around the same time as the first

49:33.900 --> 49:39.020
one came out last year, around February, I believe.

49:39.020 --> 49:44.500
If it was a new version of Sonic R with the same awesome music, maybe I'd care, but...

49:44.500 --> 49:46.140
Yeah, it's just not...

49:46.140 --> 49:51.980
Riders was okay, it was an alright game, but, I don't know, put it this way, as long as

49:51.980 --> 49:56.900
it controls better than Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3 and 360, I'm fine with that.

49:56.900 --> 50:00.140
Ooh, that was, that's a burn right there because that game sucks.

50:00.140 --> 50:04.740
Alright, so, I'm very sorry, guys, we're not going to be able to do the Skype line tonight,

50:04.740 --> 50:09.620
live radio, and things are broken and it's not running at the same time as our recording

50:09.620 --> 50:13.060
software does, so that's okay, we'll bring it back next week.

50:13.060 --> 50:16.900
We'll take more calls next week to make up for it, but we will do some Ask Orange Lounge

50:16.900 --> 50:17.900
tonight.

50:17.900 --> 50:20.460
We do have our chat room is still working, you guys can interact with us through that,

50:20.460 --> 50:25.060
so if you have a question for us, send me a private message in the chat room and we'll

50:25.060 --> 50:28.900
do some Ask Orange Lounge here in just a moment, I see some questions starting to come in.

50:28.900 --> 50:31.140
I like the bubble noises, that was fun.

50:31.140 --> 50:34.740
No, I didn't like that, I don't know if the chat, that might have been when our stream

50:34.740 --> 50:37.660
died, I don't know if they heard the bubble noises or not.

50:37.660 --> 50:43.860
Well, you can probably go in there and adjust it so that it's line in stuff, I don't know,

50:43.860 --> 50:44.860
fucking hate Skype.

50:44.860 --> 50:50.180
Yeah, I don't know, at this point, let's just, do we really want to break the show further

50:50.180 --> 50:51.180
tonight?

50:51.180 --> 50:52.180
Yeah!

50:52.180 --> 50:53.180
Might as well go all or nothing.

50:53.180 --> 50:55.740
Let's go all the way, man, let's break the show.

50:55.740 --> 51:00.380
Alright, well there are some comments in chat about the whole Sega thing going on, Ross

51:00.380 --> 51:03.980
Deal UT says, Sega doesn't know how to make good games anymore, how could you not know

51:03.980 --> 51:06.300
this was fake?

51:06.300 --> 51:08.780
They do ruin all their franchises they touch lately.

51:08.780 --> 51:13.200
And also, if you looked at that list, that's a huge fucking list, I mean, there's no way

51:13.200 --> 51:14.420
they're working on that much.

51:14.420 --> 51:19.580
The only thing that was missing from it was Panzer Dragoon Saga 2, that was it.

51:19.580 --> 51:23.700
Everything else is like, and boy.

51:23.700 --> 51:30.140
Let's see, um, Raven's Dolphin says, no Skype, wow, OLR is having my kind of failure.

51:30.140 --> 51:31.260
There you go.

51:31.260 --> 51:34.340
Dartitsui has said they should make a new Jet Set Radio for the Wii anyway.

51:34.340 --> 51:36.380
Not for the Wii, make it for the 360.

51:36.380 --> 51:38.660
Dartitsui says, oh hell, a new Samba de Amigo.

51:38.660 --> 51:39.660
Yes.

51:39.660 --> 51:40.660
I found my Samba stuff.

51:40.660 --> 51:41.660
I know, I saw that, it made me happy.

51:41.660 --> 51:45.420
Did you see that they had a Samba de Amigo listed as a PSP title on it?

51:45.420 --> 51:48.980
Yeah, what are you going to do, shake your stupid PSP?

51:48.980 --> 51:51.100
I'm going to make a game for the PSP.

51:51.100 --> 51:52.100
Called Shake?

51:52.100 --> 51:57.300
No, no, no, no, no, no, hear me out, and it's going to have a rumble, like, detector, and

51:57.300 --> 51:59.100
it's going to be like a baby simulator.

51:59.100 --> 52:01.500
I knew it was going to be a Shake the Baby game.

52:01.500 --> 52:06.500
I knew when you started talking it was going to be a Shake the Baby game, that's so wrong.

52:06.500 --> 52:07.500
I like it.

52:07.500 --> 52:11.340
Alright, so we promised we'd do some Ask Orange Lounge, so I'm going to read some questions

52:11.340 --> 52:13.860
here from our chatroom, and unfortunately we don't have the theme music unless Shane

52:13.860 --> 52:14.860
wants to sing it.

52:14.860 --> 52:15.860
Um, what's the theme music?

52:15.860 --> 52:18.740
Do the same as the mailbag music, because we're cheap here on this program.

52:18.740 --> 52:20.100
Um, no thank you.

52:20.100 --> 52:22.780
Alright, let's Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question.

52:22.780 --> 52:23.780
Let's start off with this.

52:23.780 --> 52:25.940
That's probably a stupid question indeed.

52:25.940 --> 52:31.300
Well, it's from Raven's Dolphin, and the question just hearts, just teasing.

52:31.300 --> 52:34.660
Raven's Dolphin says, Skye, how come you do not talk about your iBook, because I got a

52:34.660 --> 52:36.420
MacBook and like it.

52:36.420 --> 52:39.540
I'm playing with it, so he can't talk about it.

52:39.540 --> 52:43.500
I like my iBook, I do, you know what, it's the only internet I have right now because

52:43.500 --> 52:47.020
that's how I'm able to steal the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

52:47.020 --> 52:48.660
The screensaver's really pretty.

52:48.660 --> 52:52.020
Well you can choose from several different screensavers, I don't know if you're aware.

52:52.020 --> 52:54.420
I think there's much more to the Mac than just the screensaver.

52:54.420 --> 52:55.420
Without it.

52:55.420 --> 53:00.540
Oh yeah, there's being able to play WoW on it, but very badly, because I can't fly down.

53:00.540 --> 53:04.900
For me, who does a lot of work on the road, and who travels a lot, it's great.

53:04.900 --> 53:09.740
I love the Mac for that stuff, and it's got a great DVD authoring program on it.

53:09.740 --> 53:11.780
I will give it that.

53:11.780 --> 53:12.820
Let's go to some more questions.

53:12.820 --> 53:17.640
Of course, Ask Orange Lounge tonight in lieu of the Skype line, since we do not have the

53:17.640 --> 53:18.860
Skype line tonight.

53:18.860 --> 53:22.660
DJ Janai asks, how was moving last week?

53:22.660 --> 53:27.100
It was long, and tedious, and I'm very glad to be done with it.

53:27.100 --> 53:31.340
And the new house that I live in is so much better than the apartment I was in before,

53:31.340 --> 53:35.140
with no disrespect to Extrofer, because living with Extrofer was fun, but just the place

53:35.140 --> 53:37.780
itself is so much better now, or in a house.

53:37.780 --> 53:40.380
There's actually a backyard and a lawn demo, it's something else.

53:40.380 --> 53:45.220
I saw an animal run by in the backyard today, it was really scary, it was loud and thumpy.

53:45.220 --> 53:47.020
Cool, what kind of animal was it?

53:47.020 --> 53:49.740
Like either a cat or a raccoon or something.

53:49.740 --> 53:50.740
Maybe a possum.

53:50.740 --> 53:51.740
Yeah, possums.

53:51.740 --> 53:52.740
We'll see.

53:52.740 --> 53:57.460
DJ Tyrant wants to know, what do you think of any of the announcements at BlizzCon this

53:57.460 --> 53:58.460
weekend?

53:58.460 --> 53:59.460
Oh my goodness.

53:59.460 --> 54:00.460
Let's talk about BlizzCon.

54:00.460 --> 54:05.460
DJ Tyrant, listen to part A, buddy, listen to part A and let us know what you think.

54:05.460 --> 54:11.020
Going to Alex Silvara, does anyone like the Dynasty Samurai Warriors series besides me?

54:11.020 --> 54:15.140
Oh, I did hear there's a new incarnation coming out with that on Xbox 360.

54:15.140 --> 54:18.020
Okay, I'm through.

54:18.020 --> 54:21.700
They're going to be doing Dynasty Warriors Gundam, that's coming out in August.

54:21.700 --> 54:26.260
Then they've got that Warriors Orochi, which is coming out in September, which is pretty

54:26.260 --> 54:30.020
much Dynasty Warriors mixed with Samurai Warriors, and to be honest, I couldn't tell

54:30.020 --> 54:32.400
the two apart.

54:32.400 --> 54:36.920
Now there's Dynasty Warriors 6, which actually looks like they did something with the series

54:36.920 --> 54:44.460
and made it look a little bit better on 360, so I don't know.

54:44.460 --> 54:47.460
Gameplay-wise, they haven't changed anything, but graphically, it looks like they haven't

54:47.460 --> 54:50.660
changed anything either, so I don't know.

54:50.660 --> 54:53.420
Not much I could really be excited about.

54:53.420 --> 54:59.040
Although there is Samurai Warrior Katana later this year, so.

54:59.040 --> 55:03.020
Going over to a question from RossDLUT, here's actually a really good question and something

55:03.020 --> 55:04.660
that wasn't brought up earlier in the show.

55:04.660 --> 55:08.660
With the recent raids on mod chippers, the internet's pretty much gone nuts.

55:08.660 --> 55:12.500
The question I have is, well, are people so selfish that they feel gamers shouldn't

55:12.500 --> 55:14.140
have to support game companies?

55:14.140 --> 55:18.540
Personally, I'd rather XSeed were able to make profits than have 500 pirates to every

55:18.540 --> 55:21.620
one importer.

55:21.620 --> 55:22.620
Interesting point.

55:22.620 --> 55:25.580
I mean, because there's been, like, those raids going on, apparently, about all these

55:25.580 --> 55:27.100
people that will mod chip your systems.

55:27.100 --> 55:30.020
I'm very curious to hear what you think about this, Loki.

55:30.020 --> 55:31.740
About modding and stuff like that?

55:31.740 --> 55:33.460
And all the crackdowns and all that?

55:33.460 --> 55:39.660
Well, I mean, what they're doing is violating the law, but, I mean, at the same time, there's

55:39.660 --> 55:44.020
ways around things that you don't necessarily have to put a hardware mod chip into it, nor

55:44.020 --> 55:46.140
to be able to play stuff from other countries.

55:46.140 --> 55:50.580
I think, also, the problem is, like, with a lot of these things, you know, games are

55:50.580 --> 55:55.540
expensive now, don't get me wrong, but, at the same time, you know, people are kind of

55:55.540 --> 55:58.380
jaded with paying 60 bucks and getting crap.

55:58.380 --> 56:01.620
They're getting hosed, and, like, they kind of justify it in a way, well, fuck this.

56:01.620 --> 56:06.820
I wasted, you know, 60 bucks on Bomberman Act Zero, and I thought it was going to be

56:06.820 --> 56:11.660
a really awesome game, and it's just crap, you know, and now I can't get my money back,

56:11.660 --> 56:15.380
so fuck you, I'm going to steal your next game, you know.

56:15.380 --> 56:19.660
There's that, and there's also, you know, with importing, I don't understand why more

56:19.660 --> 56:24.500
systems are like the PlayStation 3 and the PSP, you know, let people import their games

56:24.500 --> 56:25.500
if they want to.

56:25.500 --> 56:29.300
Hell, it sells an extra copy for you, you still make some money off of it, and, you

56:29.300 --> 56:32.300
know, I don't think it's really hurting anything, okay, it's going to be a Japanese version

56:32.300 --> 56:33.700
of the game or something.

56:33.700 --> 56:35.580
Big deal, you know.

56:35.580 --> 56:39.380
I think in the big scope of things, too, there's so few people that actually import in the

56:39.380 --> 56:42.820
big scope of gaming, it's not that big a deal, I don't think.

56:42.820 --> 56:43.820
It's not.

56:43.820 --> 56:47.420
I mean, hell, that's, how else did Elite Beat Agents get a release here, but from people

56:47.420 --> 56:48.420
importing Ohndon?

56:48.420 --> 56:49.420
Exactly.

56:49.420 --> 56:54.580
And you know what, hey, look, my buying, um, GS68 just said the same damn thing in chat.

56:54.580 --> 56:59.060
You know, my buying Wangan Midnight, that sold one extra copy for them, and you know

56:59.060 --> 57:00.060
why I bought it?

57:00.060 --> 57:05.180
Because there's not a lot of stuff coming out over here, so, what the hell?

57:05.180 --> 57:10.180
Um, yeah, you know, but as far as just, like, pirating to get a bunch of games for free,

57:10.180 --> 57:15.300
especially when you're downloading things like Halo 3, and Blue Dragon, you know, assumably

57:15.300 --> 57:18.780
when these games come out, Blue Dragon, kind of like the stuff, you know, you know it's

57:18.780 --> 57:20.780
not going to be like Borrow Man X-Zero, it's a little different.

57:20.780 --> 57:25.980
Let me put it this way, okay, yeah, my PSP is modded, yes, I can play games without having

57:25.980 --> 57:29.860
to buy them, but, would I have bought those games if it wasn't modded?

57:29.860 --> 57:31.300
No, I wouldn't have.

57:31.300 --> 57:34.820
I just play games that are from other countries just to check them out.

57:34.820 --> 57:38.540
I normally don't end up, you know, buying them, I would have felt bad if I actually

57:38.540 --> 57:39.540
bought them because they sucked.

57:39.540 --> 57:40.540
So.

57:40.540 --> 57:44.060
It's also not like you don't buy video games, I mean, you have a shitload of video games

57:44.060 --> 57:47.180
everywhere in this house, so, you buy a lot of video games.

57:47.180 --> 57:51.220
I spend a lot of money on video games, and you know what, if I can play something for

57:51.220 --> 57:55.900
free instead of paying for it, yeah, I'll do it because it frees up more money for buying

57:55.900 --> 57:58.340
something else.

57:58.340 --> 58:03.340
Legend of Zaku has this for Ask Orange Lounge, bring back the camera, bringing back the webcam

58:03.340 --> 58:04.340
would be hot.

58:04.340 --> 58:07.980
It looks like it is going to happen in the new studio, but we're just not sure, I mean,

58:07.980 --> 58:11.180
getting a webcam in there isn't a problem, now it's just about delivering it to the site,

58:11.180 --> 58:13.420
so we will have more information on that later.

58:13.420 --> 58:18.700
Yes, we've seen the suggestions about, I don't know what, Justin TV, Operator 11, whatever

58:18.700 --> 58:23.500
site Travis Donovan's using, or Saturday, we're looking into what we want to use, and

58:23.500 --> 58:24.500
we'll have more information on that later.

58:24.500 --> 58:31.460
I even thought about doing something in here, if we had time, so I buried the Xbox Vision

58:31.460 --> 58:35.220
camera because I haven't used it for anything.

58:35.220 --> 58:37.720
Something soon, we will definitely have a cam in the new studio because the new studio

58:37.720 --> 58:39.540
will be awesome, I hope.

58:39.540 --> 58:44.140
Nintendo maniac 64 says, question for Loki, how does it feel to be surrounded by grown

58:44.140 --> 58:45.140
gay men?

58:45.140 --> 58:49.540
I don't, I don't get it.

58:49.540 --> 58:51.820
I know, what's the big deal?

58:51.820 --> 58:54.100
I don't know.

58:54.100 --> 58:57.860
Ban him, he's homophobic, he's the one that broke Gay Gamer.

58:57.860 --> 59:01.140
Speaking of which, you know, what do you think about that whole like GayGamer.net getting

59:01.140 --> 59:02.140
targeted?

59:02.140 --> 59:03.140
I felt really sad.

59:03.140 --> 59:08.340
I met Flynn at Comic Con, and he's a really nice guy, so somebody doing that to his site

59:08.340 --> 59:09.340
really kind of makes me...

59:09.340 --> 59:13.260
Especially if it was all this hate crime and stuff, you know, that's so gay that somebody

59:13.260 --> 59:14.260
would do that.

59:14.260 --> 59:15.260
It really is.

59:15.260 --> 59:18.500
It's a joke, people, bad joke, sorry.

59:18.500 --> 59:19.860
I am gay, I can say that.

59:19.860 --> 59:21.460
No, it's still bad.

59:21.460 --> 59:27.380
NM64 says, how few frames per seconds do you predict your current PC would get while playing

59:27.380 --> 59:28.380
Crysis?

59:28.380 --> 59:30.640
I think mine would die.

59:30.640 --> 59:36.640
As it is, shit, until I upgraded the video drivers, which I think they were current,

59:36.640 --> 59:39.780
but for some reason it was having issues, because they installed like three different

59:39.780 --> 59:44.460
sets of video drivers, they were all running concurrent.

59:44.460 --> 59:49.260
You know, ever since I did that, my computer before that was just resetting randomly, it

59:49.260 --> 59:50.260
was just boops!

59:50.260 --> 59:51.260
Dop.

59:51.260 --> 59:52.260
I used to have that problem.

59:52.260 --> 59:54.480
And I was like, fucking A, I'm gonna have to buy another PC.

59:54.480 --> 59:57.740
I did though, this weekend though, I bought a magazine, because I'm actually looking to

59:57.740 --> 01:00:04.660
buy a new PC, or build one, and unfortunately my dream PC is like $11,000, so I need to

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:06.380
scale down quite a bit.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.940
How do you make a, wow.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:12.100
But they have a nice article, this PC game, or PC building bible, they have a build your

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:17.420
own game PC under $1400, and it looks nice, and it's all blue.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:24.700
I want an all blue PC, somebody get me some paint, I'll paint my PC, and it'll be blue.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.940
Or Rob will say it's purple, and try to trick me, but it's not going to be, it's going to

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:28.940
be blue.

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:32.740
Alright, one more AskBorne's Lounge question for you guys, and then we're gonna call it

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.740
a show.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:38.620
Dark Tetsuya is asking, did you hear ID is releasing all their older stuff on Steam,

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:40.980
even as far back as the Commander Keen stuff?

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:43.300
What's a Commander Keen?

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.300
How old are you?

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.580
You're like a baby, you weren't around for Commander Keen, were you?

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:52.940
Commander Keen was kinda like, I don't know, like, ID's Mario game for the PC, I don't

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.380
know how else to explain it really.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:01:01.940
It was like a side-scrolling game that was very it was fun though, a lot of folks that

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:04.020
had computers in the 90s remember.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.140
It was the shit on shareware.

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.140
That's right.

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.140
It was awesome.

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.140
And all about jazz.

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:11.780
I actually did not, I heard, I know that name, but I don't know what it is.

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.700
I heard some of their other stuff was coming to Steam, but I didn't know the old stuff

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:19.060
was, they didn't, they didn't Freeware release that stuff a long time ago?

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.860
I don't know.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:23.740
What was the other company that was with ID back then, Epic, right?

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.180
Epic Mega Games.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.860
And didn't Epic do ZZT?

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:27.860
What's that?

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:28.860
Uh, yes.

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:29.860
ZZ Top?

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:30.860
No, no, no.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.340
ZZT was like this totally awesome game.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.340
It is.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.340
Oh my gosh.

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.340
ZZT was rad.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:41.540
So many, I was such a nerd that I spent so many hours making games.

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:45.100
You can make your own games, it was like a programming language for games, but it's hard

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.100
to explain.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:51.860
It's all using ASCII characters, so your games would be very blocky and stuff, but as it

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:58.260
went on, they also released this new thing called Mega Zooks where you can create your

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:01.100
own games as well, but it was a little bit more intuitive.

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:06.980
They had, you know, Ooh, mod music, you could, you know, mod tracker stuff in there and just

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.800
all sorts of interesting things.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.320
I want to say like years ago on this show, like we had an entire three hour conversation

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.820
about ZZT one night.

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:16.820
Like it's crazy.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:17.820
It's what?

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:18.820
I have an excellent idea.

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.820
What, OLR the ZZT?

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:27.820
We need a contest, a game designing contest in ZZT sponsored by OLR.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:28.820
That would be awesome.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:29.820
All right.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.420
We'll, we'll work out the details and come up with that for a future program.

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:33.420
That would be awesome.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.820
Is there still ZZT programming communities?

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:35.820
Oh, we can find it.

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.580
There's gotta be somewhere.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:40.860
Shadow Slayer says, I swear this guy is making these games up.

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.060
Put it on Wikipedia or something.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.260
I'm not making this shit up.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.220
ZZT is a real game.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.340
Hitstun says, fuck the unreal engine ZZT forever.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:49.340
Amen.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:56.540
I'm glad your listeners are old.

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.860
Would you allow them to use super ZZT or any of the other ZZT months?

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.180
I didn't like super ZZT.

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:05.780
If anything, we'd either do it in the original ZZT or we would do Mega Zooks cause Mega Zooks

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:06.780
was pretty awesome.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.000
You can do a lot of cool shit in that.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.800
I want to have, I'm banging on the desk because I have a great idea.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.980
You know, one thing I've said I wanted to do for orange lounge in our new season, we

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:19.380
get to the new studio is more interviews, we need to get people who made ZZT on the

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.380
program.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.380
Just to talk about ZZT.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.340
I want to talk about it.

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.340
Interview me.

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:28.060
I wear a top hat and a monocle and a mustache so I can pretend I'm old.

01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.020
You can pretend you're Colonel Mustard.

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.020
What?

01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.020
He didn't wear a top hat.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.740
I'll get a cane too.

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.780
I'll be like, yes, that's ZZT.

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:36.780
Here it is.

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:38.100
Here it is in Wikipedia.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.100
It's right there.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.100
Oh, it had color?

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.660
Yes, it did have color.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.340
They had color back when we were kids.

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.340
Imagine that.

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.340
It's crazy.

01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:48.140
It was created in 1991 by Tim Sweeney of Epic Games.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.020
Wasn't it you who I asked about color TVs?

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.020
Yes.

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:57.740
I asked if he watched, what it was like if you were asking me like what seeing color

01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:05.540
TV was like for the first time and I was serious because I didn't know how old do you think

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.540
he is?

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:10.580
And he asked me how black and white TV was back in the day and I'm thinking like, well,

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:13.980
they used to show Dennis the Menace reruns on Nickelodeon in black and white, but that

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:14.980
was about it.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:15.980
I didn't know.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:22.220
It was a time though that I did have an old ass, it was a 286 system, it was like a 28620

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:26.460
or something like that with the whole 32 megs of hard drive space.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:31.820
And anyways, so there was one game we had because we had just these really budget ass

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:32.820
games.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:36.340
It was like a, what was it, a Muppets game or something like that and because it was

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:40.140
on a black and white monitor, you had to play it on like a CGA monitor or something like

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:43.580
that, which was four colors and they all sucked.

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.180
It was fucking hard to see it.

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:49.580
You couldn't see and wanted to push a button or something so it just went blank screen.

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.900
Finally one day we were like, I think I see something on there.

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:56.980
And so we hit the button and then we found out, oh look, the game sucks.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:03.020
Loki look at this, it's a screenshot from the town of ZZT featuring the bank of ZZT.

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:08.140
The bank of ZZT and the whole program, that first, because you can play through, there's

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.220
like this huge game and stuff that you can play through on there.

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:16.820
And then the actual, the game that it came with was locked so you couldn't edit it.

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:20.500
But there was a program that you can hack the thing and actually unlock it.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.340
And man, the bank little program thing was kind of complicated.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.820
It was pretty cool looking.

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:31.100
But shit, I remember my friends, we used to be like real into like Robotech and shit and

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:35.220
he would make like Robotech ZZT levels and all sorts of weird stuff.

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.300
Oh my god, remember Code Red, which was one of the add-on packs for ZZT?

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.980
No, no, like this huge series somebody made for ZZT.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:47.700
There was a lot of really big series, I mean god, back in the day I used to be so into

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.700
that stuff.

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.420
Alright, we need to stop being so old.

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.420
So we're going to talk about this.

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.220
What, you got something else real quick?

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:56.700
No, I said we're going to just keep talking about this if we don't.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:01.620
I do have some last minute stories, they're interesting, well I don't know if they're

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:08.620
interesting but we've got a picture of Big Brain Academy, the board game.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:13.460
I love Big Brain Academy on the DS, that could be cool.

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:18.300
And it looks like it comes with your own, I don't know, crack scale?

01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:22.140
Because there's like a weird scale on there.

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.060
I guess that's what that is, some sort of drug scale.

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:28.620
Train your brain to smoke more crack.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:32.300
So that's kind of interesting.

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:35.440
The Wii remote's getting yet another strap.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.780
Yay!

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:37.840
Hahaha.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:41.000
Hurray for straps!

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.960
Give it up for straps everybody!

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.480
Alright, those Wii remotes are strapped yo.

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.820

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:49.820

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:50.820
Alright, thank you.

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:53.480
No but don't they have like little clasps on them, little new straps?

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.920
Yeah, there's straps with clasps on now.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:56.920
Alright.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:57.920
Wooo.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:03.200
Jaden has a tip for you Shane if you want to experience what black and white

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:08.100
TV was like turn the color setting all the way down on your color TV and you'll

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:12.100
have a black and white TV. Why would I do that? I don't even know how to do that on my TV.

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.420
Because you wanted to know what watching black and white TV was like so there you

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:23.120
go. Well I was asking to hear about it. Or watch the purple network. I'll flip you off.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:28.960
I thought you didn't swear. It's not. It's my fingers. I remember having an old-ass TV and

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:34.080
trying to I was like ooh I get 13 channels that sucks let's see if I can

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:41.720
tune anything on and UHF oh no I get one Spanish channel that's about it. I have a

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:46.480
last-minute story hurry for those people that play Wow

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.800

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:56.800

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:04.840

our program you're welcome and your final thought please I want to play the

01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:29.840

want to go see a movie because yeah I do I want to see hairspray this and I want

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:40.360

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:45.080
think about it all right thank you I will look at your final thought my final

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:51.440
thought is yet another last-minute story and it was Nestor J the NES emulator

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:58.680
just got released on the PSP version 1.11 RM which means rewind and mirror

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.120
mods so apparently this game has now become like Prince of Persia the sands

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.720
of time where you can play like Super Mario Brothers and oh no I fucked up

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:11.760
rewind that's pretty cool wait Nestor like a remix like Howard and

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:17.760
Nestor yes and also like the NES emulator on the PSP or every other

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.680
platform out there all right did you not get that reference cuz I got roles and

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.600
now I subscribe to Nintendo Power when I was little I saw the first issue in a

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.800
box somewhere it's all torn I probably don't anymore I remember the

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:34.080
Castlevania issue and the issue six or the last issue of the Nintendo fan club

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.240

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:43.920

great night until next week go away see you next time thank you so much for

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.640
supporting independent radio if you like the show tell two friends about our show

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.380
because that's how we get the word out because of course you know we don't well

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.960
we're poor so we can't exactly buy advertisements and magazines so we rely

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.600
on your word of mouth if you enjoyed what you heard or if you didn't enjoy

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.120
what you hear tell people how much we suck cuz we'll still get listeners that

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:12.600
way and I'll make ourselves feel good so that's it and that's really really it

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.000
there's no outro tonight we lost all our music in the temporary studio remember

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:36.040
