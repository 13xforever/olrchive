2
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:20,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:49,089
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

4
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:11,282
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of neat.

5
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:16,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the tokens that you can earn in the game are in four different tiers.

6
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:17,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Red, blue, green, and gold.

7
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:22,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Red tokens are gained by scanning enemies and items.

8
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue for scanning lore and completing side quests.

9
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Green ones you get from friends.

10
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:33,878
[SPEAKER_08]: And gold is achieved from defeating bosses on various difficulties.

11
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:36,980
[SPEAKER_08]: What is different from this and like the trophies that you earn in Burnout?

12
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:38,541
[SPEAKER_10]: I think nothing.

13
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:39,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely nothing.

15
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:43,604
[SPEAKER_10]: So what is so noteworthy about this?

16
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:45,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it the fact that it's the first time in a Metroid game?

17
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:49,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess people are thinking, oh my god, achievements are coming!

18
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,430
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

19
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,251
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

20
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:57,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well one other thing that people would like to see coming to the Wii any day now is online play.

21
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,741
[SPEAKER_10]: And also demos.

22
00:02:01,383 --> 00:02:01,984
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23
00:02:16,142 --> 00:02:35,414
[SPEAKER_10]: and on it are some different types of questions on it and they seem to point towards the all signs you could say point to the fact that they're at least exploring the possibility of doing downloadable demos of course to date all we've really seen come from them would be the Metroid Prime 3 preview channel

24
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the things here.

25
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:41,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Please indicate your level of interest in playable demo versions of Wii games.

26
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:44,513
[SPEAKER_10]: What is your preferred method of receiving Wii game demos?

27
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:48,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you be willing to pay more for your subscription in order to receive Wii game demos?

28
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:51,095
[SPEAKER_10]: So, kind of interesting there.

29
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:54,956
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be kind of cool if Nintendo Power did have Wii game demos.

30
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:57,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the other big three consoles do for their magazines.

31
00:02:57,717 --> 00:02:58,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

32
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:05,400
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would like to see the Wii actually able to download things other than virtual console titles.

33
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:07,512
[SPEAKER_08]: and a few crappy tales.

34
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:09,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're supposed to have original software.

35
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:11,533
[SPEAKER_10]: At least we know about that Mission Impossible thing, right?

36
00:03:11,553 --> 00:03:14,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, they're supposed to go online someday, too.

37
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:15,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on.

38
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:16,975
[SPEAKER_08]: The console's been out for almost a year now.

39
00:03:17,455 --> 00:03:21,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Time to start following through with that shit you've been promising us for a while now.

40
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,017
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

41
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Or we're going to have to start calling you Sony.

42
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:27,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, burn.

43
00:03:27,798 --> 00:03:28,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

44
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:28,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

45
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:31,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, how about some happy Nintendo news?

46
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:32,519
[SPEAKER_11]: How does that sound?

47
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:33,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good to me.

48
00:03:34,036 --> 00:03:36,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, guess what is back for Super Mario Galaxy?

49
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,720
[SPEAKER_11]: We have fire flowers and superstars.

50
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,742
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the fire flowers so much because they're like burning things.

51
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:46,924
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just happy that Mario can set fire to things again.

52
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:52,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, the fire flower was such a great weapon and then we just didn't get it.

53
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,349
[SPEAKER_11]: We had him squirt shit with water.

54
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:55,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Boo.

55
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario 64 Mario 64 Mario 64 Mario 64

56
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:25,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked it on Nintendo because they totally recreated the Super Nintendo graphics on the Nintendo.

57
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to chat room for some comments at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

58
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:32,187
[SPEAKER_10]: RossDLUT says, Loki, stop wishing and relying on Nintendo's word.

59
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:35,608
[SPEAKER_10]: ShadowCharlie says, Tanooki suit.

60
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:37,328
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a great thing to come back.

61
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:38,349
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, Hammer Brothers suit.

62
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:39,409
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be pretty rad.

63
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:42,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Or the Kuriboh's boot.

64
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Kuriboh's shoe.

65
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:44,291
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

66
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:44,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was it.

67
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,232
[SPEAKER_11]: But in other news, we do have a release date for the UK on this.

68
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:52,013
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be November 16th.

69
00:04:52,653 --> 00:04:53,154
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

70
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:55,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Not soon enough, right?

71
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:56,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Not soon enough.

72
00:04:57,176 --> 00:04:57,556
[SPEAKER_08]: All righty.

73
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:00,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

74
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:02,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I do want to know who this new hoochie in the game is, though.

75
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:02,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

76
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:11,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, interesting news, and we knew this was kind of coming, but finally the Wii has passed

77
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:14,878
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox 360 in worldwide sales.

78
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:30,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the last screenshot that we've seen of this was of course a few days ago with the Wii having approximately 10.57 million units worldwide and the Xbox 360 having 10.51 million units.

79
00:05:30,603 --> 00:05:35,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the PS3 still trailing behind with 4.32 million units.

80
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:40,087
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be known though that still the 360 is outselling

81
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,573
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii in the US, but apparently, you know, Japan is where they're making up for a lot of slack.

82
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:53,178
[SPEAKER_10]: So, what does this mean for Nintendo fanboys?

83
00:05:53,238 --> 00:05:57,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this something additional for them to brag about, or is this really not the big deal, it seems like?

84
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:07,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's fuel for, you know, flame fodder, I guess, because the Wii has basically caught up to the 360 in half the time.

85
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:09,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

86
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's really good.

87
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:16,791
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if they could produce more units, it would be even higher.

88
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:19,935
[SPEAKER_08]: But hopefully that means more support.

89
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:20,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Better games!

90
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:22,741
[SPEAKER_10]: XBOX 360 XBOX 360

91
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:47,260
[SPEAKER_10]: That means it's not going to be on shelves for the day after Thanksgiving madness, so that's kind of too bad.

92
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,686
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm sure those people that have been very good boys and girls this year as they put this on their Christmas list, I'm sure Santa will find a way, right?

93
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:55,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

94
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:59,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, then again, if you believe in Santa, you probably should not be playing Mass Effect.

95
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:00,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Come to think of it.

96
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:02,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Why does Santa die in it?

97
00:07:02,975 --> 00:07:03,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

98
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:04,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Possibly.

99
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:18,838
[SPEAKER_11]: For anyone who is at Penny Arcade Expo, they did confirm that Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness is going to be on an Xbox Live Arcade in 2008.

100
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:22,161
[SPEAKER_11]: It was also announced for PC, Mac OS X, and Linux.

101
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:25,183
[SPEAKER_11]: So, hey, game.

102
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:26,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

103
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:28,706
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of interesting.

104
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:31,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that the console you guys would have guessed that this was going to be released on?

105
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:32,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

106
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,131
[SPEAKER_10]: I sort of thought so, too.

107
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:44,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because, you know, there's the... For a long time now, there's been the little picture icons and themes and all that stuff that you can download on Xbox Live, so why not this?

108
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not now their game on Xbox Live?

109
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:47,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

110
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:50,559
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's more money to be done, why not?

111
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:55,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, putting arcade adventures isn't the only thing coming to Xbox Live soon.

112
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:02,642
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a rumor, of course, with the fall update due out in November, that it's possibly going to include XFID support.

113
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:03,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

114
00:08:04,201 --> 00:08:07,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, some other plans from this leaked list.

115
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:19,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Supposedly a new Xbox Live Arcade Blade, IPTV support, integrated clan functionality, a picture-in-picture setting, and improved slideshow effects.

116
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:23,316
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be pretty awesome if it had Xvid codec support.

117
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:24,797
[SPEAKER_08]: What exactly is Xvid?

118
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,177
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like DivX.

119
00:08:26,277 --> 00:08:35,081
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a video codec for encoding MPEG-4 video so that you can rip a DVD and have it be a decent file size.

120
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:36,821
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty popular.

121
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:39,762
[SPEAKER_10]: But you would still have to stream it.

122
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:43,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm saying you still have to have it in WMV format, right?

123
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:45,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about that.

124
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I would imagine you would, but who knows.

125
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:52,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony is also not going to E for All

126
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,962
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also some other companies that have said they're not going, including Capcom and so on.

127
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:24,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Some companies that are going, though, would be Nintendo and Konami.

128
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:31,503
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not like it's going to be an empty show, but it is going to be a little bit of a bummer that you don't have two of the big three showing up at E!

129
00:09:31,563 --> 00:09:32,003
[SPEAKER_10]: For All.

130
00:09:32,684 --> 00:09:36,584
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know about you guys, but the fact that I'm actually kind of planning on going to E!

131
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:44,426
[SPEAKER_10]: For All, because, you know, I got an invite and everything, and I was planning the trip to go to L.A., I'm a little bit irritated that some of these companies are dropping out of E!

132
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:44,886
[SPEAKER_10]: For All.

133
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:46,766
[SPEAKER_10]: That news makes me a little bit angsty.

134
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,014
[SPEAKER_10]: and when we get angsty, people die.

135
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:50,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and the FUs of the week come out.

136
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:03,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with tonight's FUs?

137
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, FU to my broken head.

138
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:08,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, it still hurts.

139
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,223
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it happened, what, four hours ago?

140
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:14,409
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's not four.

141
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:15,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Why am I saying four?

142
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Three hours, two hours, whatever, ago, and it still hurts.

143
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:25,275
[SPEAKER_11]: And a secondary FU goes toward the art block, because I've been trying to draw, and it's just not working.

144
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:28,377
[SPEAKER_10]: So instead of writer's block, it's art block.

145
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:29,418
[SPEAKER_11]: It's art block.

146
00:10:29,538 --> 00:10:33,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I've been having a bit of writer's block, too, just in different capacities.

147
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,822
[SPEAKER_10]: So FU to blocks of all shapes and sizes.

148
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,103
[SPEAKER_11]: To the block of creativity.

149
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:38,883
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

150
00:10:39,924 --> 00:10:40,224
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

151
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:41,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your FU's of the week.

152
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,232
[SPEAKER_08]: My F.U.s of the week go to my cat for constantly waking me up in the middle of the night.

153
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:50,973
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost like having a goddamn baby, so... Fuck you to the cat.

154
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Just imagine when you really have a baby.

155
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:54,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine babies in your house.

156
00:10:56,095 --> 00:10:59,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's not really fun.

157
00:10:59,497 --> 00:11:00,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really have a lot to say F.U.

158
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:01,877
[SPEAKER_10]: to this week.

159
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:04,118
[SPEAKER_10]: I've actually had a pretty good week, so F.U.

160
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:08,000
[SPEAKER_10]: to people who don't like caramel, because caramel ice cream is awesome.

161
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,620
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, maybe I shouldn't say F.U.

162
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,241
[SPEAKER_10]: to that, because that just means more for me

163
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:12,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

164
00:11:12,357 --> 00:11:12,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

165
00:11:13,557 --> 00:11:16,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Mikotov, do you have any FUs of the week while you're staring off into space over there?

166
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:21,019
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to you for thinking about getting Popsicles.

167
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they are the worst.

168
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Popsicles are awesome.

169
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing though, Mikotov.

170
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,360
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't that I was going to buy Popsicles.

171
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:31,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to buy Creamsicles.

172
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:33,481
[SPEAKER_10]: And those are awesome.

173
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:35,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

174
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:38,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's end this segment now, shall we?

175
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:42,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Are either of you guys, is anybody else in here thinking of going to E4ALL?

176
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,990
[SPEAKER_10]: I was.

177
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to go, though.

178
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,631
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't excite me as much anymore.

179
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:48,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to go.

180
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather go to PAX, but that's kind of late for that.

181
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:52,372
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bit over now.

182
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:55,193
[SPEAKER_10]: What's in it for you to see at E4ALL?

183
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Nintendo and Konami, and that's really all I remember that are actually going.

184
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:06,635
[SPEAKER_06]: But not having E3 to go to this year and going to Comic-Con made me realize that I kind of miss stuff like that.

185
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:08,816
[SPEAKER_06]: So going to E4ALL would be pretty cool.

186
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:10,113
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

187
00:12:12,015 --> 00:12:13,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get back to some gaming news.

188
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:14,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that the FUs of the week are over.

189
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, it was bound to happen.

190
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:29,071
[SPEAKER_11]: For our buddies overseas, the Xbox 360 is getting a price drop in Europe, occurring on the 24th of August.

191
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:30,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

192
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,063
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be decreasing by 20 pounds on the core unit and 30 on the 20 gigabyte 360.

193
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So it'll bring the price down respectively to $249.99.

194
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:43,026
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, that's on the 20 gig and $179.99 on the core.

195
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,467
[SPEAKER_11]: That's again in British pounds.

196
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:46,688
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Elite will retail for $299.99.

197
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:21,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, I just gotta say real quickly for the live folks, it looks like our stream is down, and I'm blaming Operator 11 for that, so at this time I'm gonna shut this off until we can work on this some other time, because this is probably taking a lot of bandwidth, so we're gonna have to get rid of this to get our stream back, so that's the end of the Op 11 simulcast for now, until we can work on that a little later.

198
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, guys.

199
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:27,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, but in the meantime, we will go back to... There was more news on that.

200
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:28,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

201
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:43,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Shizzle Games of Belgium was advertising by price from Elite down to Core in Euros as $449, $349, and $279 on their SKUs.

202
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:46,789
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's it.

203
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,491
[SPEAKER_11]: I should know my apologies.

204
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:55,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Their Core was being called the Arcade, and then they have the Pro.

205
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Very bizarre, but anyway.

206
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,590
[SPEAKER_10]: That is kind of bizarre.

207
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:02,091
[SPEAKER_11]: It's even more bizarre that they're called Shizzle Games.

208
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:05,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Shizzle Games.

209
00:14:05,172 --> 00:14:12,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the rumor, of course, of that new arcade SKU for the core system is actually supposed to be coming to the U.S.

210
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:24,999
[SPEAKER_08]: as well, and same details, no definite launch date or anything like that, but it is allegedly supposed to come out over here as well, so...

211
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:27,055
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good idea.

212
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:33,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, hey, the core system's not bad, but I know a lot of people complain that they can't save their game.

213
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:44,351
[SPEAKER_08]: So now that that's going to be coming with a memory unit, that might be something to actually look into if you're not into the whole live downloading thing.

214
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,251
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you can't spell Maneuver.

215
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:25,703
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down and all around every single week and she likes to find a website that works for all of you and it's her website of the week that she's going to share with you guys right now.

216
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:46,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Website of the week is actually suggested to me by Loki, and it's actually pretty cool.

217
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:50,269
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Cult of Rapture.

218
00:15:50,449 --> 00:16:04,695
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go to 2kgames.com slash cultofrapture, all one word, it will take you to a Bioshock page for the fans, I guess, talking about the music that's out.

219
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:09,677
[SPEAKER_11]: It has downloads, articles, a forum, goodies for everybody.

220
00:16:09,797 --> 00:16:10,518
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty cool.

221
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:11,338
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very pretty.

222
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:13,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's actually very, very pretty.

223
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:19,250
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do believe that you have to be over 18 to view the page.

224
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,112
[SPEAKER_11]: So, go see it.

225
00:16:21,152 --> 00:16:24,514
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll be posting the address into the chat room presently.

226
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:25,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Very cool.

227
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:26,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty.

228
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

229
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:59,558
[SPEAKER_08]: something else that's pretty awesome fans of Geometry Wars will be quite happy because with Project Gotham Racing 4 they'll be getting a brand new Geometry Wars game and no info though on it's supposed to be not too different than Retro Evolved but it is going to be a little bit different it's called Geometry War Waves so no real details though on what exactly is different but apparently not that much

230
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:07,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know what's going to change in the great amount of time it's going to take for this game to come out, because Spore is apparently finished.

231
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:13,465
[SPEAKER_10]: The game is not totally finished and ready to go, but apparently the game is complete.

232
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:17,786
[SPEAKER_10]: This is coming from reports of people who have had hands-on with Spore at Leipzig.

233
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:29,089
[SPEAKER_10]: EA is simply going to be spending the next few months listening to feedback from players, assuming the QA testers and beta testers, to tweak and polish Spore for its final release, which is still set for next spring.

234
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:37,597
[SPEAKER_10]: So, certainly you can look around the internet on some different blogs there and find some hands-on reports from Spore, which is definitely a game I am certainly looking forward to.

235
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,639
[SPEAKER_10]: So, GS68 in our chatroom says, Spore forever?

236
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:41,860
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

237
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think you can make those jokes anymore because it does look like this game is actually going to come out.

238
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:45,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray!

239
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:47,704
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we'll see.

240
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:48,665
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

241
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:53,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, it's time for an old favorite segment of ours here on Orange Lounge Radio.

242
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:55,270
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a segment we like to call Listless.

243
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:55,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Listless.

244
00:18:02,694 --> 00:18:03,114
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

245
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:07,097
[SPEAKER_10]: The way Listless works is that we create a list here.

246
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:11,020
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to define the definitive top three of a certain category.

247
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:17,464
[SPEAKER_10]: And tonight's category is character we would most like to see in the upcoming track and field DS game.

248
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:21,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the character does not have to be a Konami character, but it helps.

249
00:18:23,108 --> 00:18:23,969
[SPEAKER_10]: So here's the deal.

250
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:24,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's how it works.

251
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:29,732
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to go around, and myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and Miklatov will all give their top three.

252
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:31,374
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's going to leave us with a list of 12.

253
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:39,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we will all go around the room and take one unworthy candidate off the list, leaving a list of eight.

254
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:45,000
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will post that list of eight to the chat room, and you'll vote for your number one and your number two picks.

255
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,483
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll tally them up, and the winning votes will be revealed a little later in the show.

256
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:50,943
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how Listless works.

257
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:52,924
[SPEAKER_10]: So who's going to start us off tonight?

258
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:54,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, you ready to go?

259
00:18:55,866 --> 00:18:56,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

260
00:18:56,306 --> 00:19:00,909
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, what's your number three pick for character you would most like to see in Track and Field?

261
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:07,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it'd be a little weird, but I would like to see... Actually, this is kind of funny.

262
00:19:07,869 --> 00:19:10,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Babylon from DDR5thMix.

263
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, Babylon from DDR5thMix.

264
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:13,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

265
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:14,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you can run as a baby?

266
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:16,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's a baby running.

267
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:17,017
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny.

268
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:18,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

269
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,262
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Babylon says Loki.

270
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Miklatov, do you have a number three pick?

271
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take Robbie the Rabbit from Silent Hill.

272
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:35,158
[SPEAKER_06]: What's cuter than a bunny with blood on its mouth running around throwing stuff like javelins and things?

273
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:36,779
[SPEAKER_11]: We're already picking just Konami.

274
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:39,462
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to pick Konami.

275
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:43,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I said it doesn't have to be Konami, but it helps.

276
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it should be Konami.

277
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:45,608
[SPEAKER_10]: The real game.

278
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it could be Nintendo because it's DS5.

279
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:49,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's leave it to Konami.

280
00:19:50,073 --> 00:19:50,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

281
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:52,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to rethink my list.

282
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:57,366
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your number three pick.

283
00:19:57,586 --> 00:19:59,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Aitsu or Koitsu from Parodius.

284
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,210
[SPEAKER_11]: They're the little stickmen riding paper airplanes.

285
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,731
[SPEAKER_10]: How the crap do you spell that?

286
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:08,534
[SPEAKER_11]: A-I-T-S-U and then K-O-I-T-S-U.

287
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,076
[SPEAKER_10]: From Parodius.

288
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:12,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

289
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:22,385
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, my number three pick would also come from DDR, and that would be Alice, the little raving character.

290
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:26,206
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what you would really call it, the dog from Silent Hill 2, from the dog ending.

291
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:56,075
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fantastic.

292
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:56,835
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the dog.

293
00:20:57,695 --> 00:20:59,756
[SPEAKER_10]: So the dog from the dog ending of Silent Hill 2.

294
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:01,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Good pick.

295
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Mikotov, your number two pick.

296
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:08,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say Evil Rose from Rumble Roses.

297
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:15,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what little boy doesn't want to watch the girls with the big breasts run around on the track?

298
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for sane ones.

299
00:21:18,314 --> 00:21:22,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so one of the big tittied girls from Rumble Roses will hopefully appear in Track and Field.

300
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:23,017
[SPEAKER_11]: No, she can't run.

301
00:21:23,297 --> 00:21:25,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, DarkSakura, your number two pick.

302
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:27,719
[SPEAKER_11]: My number two pick is going to be Pit.

303
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Pit, for now a Nintendo character.

304
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:32,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, fair enough.

305
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:35,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Pit from Kid Icarus.

306
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:35,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

307
00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:36,444
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be fun.

308
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:37,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Except he can fly.

309
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:38,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Couldn't that be cheating?

310
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:39,826
[SPEAKER_11]: So can Aitsu and Koisu.

311
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:42,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

312
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:42,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on.

313
00:21:42,987 --> 00:21:44,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two pick for me.

314
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:47,710
[SPEAKER_10]: My number two pick I would like to see in the game would be Dracula.

315
00:21:48,382 --> 00:21:49,822
[SPEAKER_10]: from, you know, the Castlevania games.

316
00:21:49,862 --> 00:21:50,562
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, why not?

317
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:54,503
[SPEAKER_10]: And then somebody can come out and say... Not by my hand.

318
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:56,123
[SPEAKER_11]: I was once again given a gold medal.

319
00:21:57,764 --> 00:21:58,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Die, monster.

320
00:21:58,764 --> 00:21:59,824
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't belong in this world.

321
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:01,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Except that was the other guy that said that.

322
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:03,645
[SPEAKER_10]: But I still think it would be cool if Dracula was in the game.

323
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:05,345
[SPEAKER_10]: So Dracula is my number two pick.

324
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Number one pick, Loki.

325
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:09,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man.

326
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:12,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

327
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:17,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one pick, I will say... Well, that doesn't really count because that's Hudson.

328
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:23,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, that could work, because Konami has license over Hudson Games now, right?

329
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

330
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,140
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do Hudson.

331
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if this would be my number one pick, but Bomberman.

332
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:36,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, because maybe Bomberman could just leave bombs on the track, yes?

333
00:22:37,822 --> 00:22:38,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

334
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:39,203
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll work.

335
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:40,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, sure.

336
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:41,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever you say, Rob.

337
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:44,104
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Miklatov, what would be your number one pick?

338
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:46,484
[SPEAKER_10]: The Left DDR Arrow.

339
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:48,915
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your number one pick.

340
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:53,418
[SPEAKER_10]: My number one pick is the mascot from Guitar Freak.

341
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's needed with the bag over his head?

342
00:23:20,663 --> 00:23:21,484
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember his name.

343
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:40,550
[SPEAKER_10]: My number one pick did not get a lot of coverage in a lot of the various Konami games that existed out there.

344
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:51,458
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, my number one pick was really obscure because he was only in one game that Konami ever put out, and it was on the PC.

345
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:58,503
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll tell you what, if you've been listening to this show for some amount of time, then you know the love that the people of this program have.

346
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:01,357
[SPEAKER_10]: My runner-up would be the Konami Code.

347
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:23,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

348
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:24,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Have the Konami code in it.

349
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,366
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

350
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:30,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I should have said the little shit from Parodius because then you can have the Sound Blaster or Twinbee.

351
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,053
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what also amazes me about this list is that not a single damn Metal Gear character on the whole list.

352
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:38,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

353
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:41,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Change Baghead Guy to Twinbee.

354
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:42,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Twinbee?

355
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:43,498
[SPEAKER_11]: To Twinbee.

356
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:44,259
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

357
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,680
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the Baghead Guy better.

358
00:24:47,461 --> 00:24:47,821
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

359
00:24:48,562 --> 00:24:48,802
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

360
00:24:48,842 --> 00:24:49,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, she changed it then.

361
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:50,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Twinbee.

362
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:54,059
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100, Matt voted for the goalie from Blazer Steel.

363
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:54,819
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty awesome.

364
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:58,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, here's the list of stands right now, but remember we're going around and eliminating off the list here.

365
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:14,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Babylon, Robbie the Rabbit, Aitsu Kwaitsu, Alice, the dog from the dog ending of Silent Hill 2, Evil Rose, Pit, Dracula, Bomberman, the left DDR arrow, Twinbee, and Mr. Spanky.

366
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Why left and not right, just out of curiosity?

367
00:25:17,514 --> 00:25:19,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's just the first one I thought of.

368
00:25:21,323 --> 00:25:23,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, one of these is not worthy of being on the list.

369
00:25:23,784 --> 00:25:25,325
[SPEAKER_10]: What is not worthy of being on the list?

370
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:34,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to say Aitsu, Koitsu, because I have no idea what the hell that is.

371
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:35,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Very obscure.

372
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:37,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was a little too obscure for my taste.

373
00:25:37,073 --> 00:25:37,753
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're awesome.

374
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:38,214
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

375
00:25:39,855 --> 00:25:41,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Miklatov, one of these is not worthy of being on the list.

376
00:25:41,796 --> 00:25:42,917
[SPEAKER_10]: What is not worthy of being on the list?

377
00:25:45,558 --> 00:25:47,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because it really looks out of place on that list, I'm going to...

378
00:25:48,723 --> 00:25:51,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to throw out Pit, even though I love Kid Icarus a whole lot.

379
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:54,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

380
00:25:55,145 --> 00:25:58,287
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, DarkSakura, what is not worthy of the list?

381
00:26:02,088 --> 00:26:08,231
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to vote for Alice.

382
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:11,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Alice is not worthy of being on the list.

383
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:14,033
[SPEAKER_10]: And Raver Kids Everywhere are crying.

384
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:14,593
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that movie about?

385
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:17,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen Alice from Supernova 2 yet?

386
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:20,035
[SPEAKER_06]: She's all dressed up like an Indian.

387
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:20,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

388
00:26:21,718 --> 00:26:22,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, whatever.

389
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:23,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

390
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,266
[SPEAKER_10]: The one I deem worthy of not being on the list is... Oh, this is hard.

391
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:32,872
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also going to take out a DDR character and say Babylon is not worthy of being on the list.

392
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:33,673
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

393
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:50,375
[SPEAKER_10]: That leaves our list as Robbie the Rabbit, The Dog from the Dog Ending of Silent Hill 2, Evil Rose, Dracula, Bomberman, The Left DDR Arrow, Twinbee, and Mr. Spanky.

394
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:56,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so I'm going to post that there in the chat room, and if you would, send a private message to Rob Roberts, not Sky tonight because I don't have my normal name.

395
00:26:57,927 --> 00:27:09,346
[SPEAKER_10]: set a private message with your number one and number two pick it is important what you designate as one and two if you do not designate I will assume your first pick is your number one so there you have it

396
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:14,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you find anything else that you thought should have been on the list, Loki?

397
00:27:14,814 --> 00:27:16,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I saw you searching Wikipedia frantically.

398
00:27:17,495 --> 00:27:18,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to think whatever.

399
00:27:18,756 --> 00:27:21,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember what the boss was called in Contra.

400
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:22,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the giant heart.

401
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:26,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I was thinking the giant alien head thing would have been pretty awesome.

402
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:29,640
[SPEAKER_08]: What about the vomiting baby turtle thing or whatever that was from like...

403
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:32,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw, we should have more time to prepare.

404
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:36,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Violent, uh, vomiting baby turtle would be awesome.

405
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:39,420
[SPEAKER_08]: An unsold copy of, what was it, Bomberman Act Zero.

406
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:44,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I was actually thinking, cause you know, I was thinking really obscure.

407
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:49,072
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if we were going Sega, I'd totally say the, uh, the Opa Opa.

408
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,370
[SPEAKER_10]: But we didn't go Sega.

409
00:27:51,531 --> 00:27:52,031
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we didn't.

410
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:52,711
[SPEAKER_10]: We sure didn't.

411
00:27:52,731 --> 00:27:54,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the Opa Opa would kill everybody.

412
00:27:54,832 --> 00:27:54,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

413
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:56,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the Opa Opa's awesome.

414
00:27:56,433 --> 00:28:02,196
[SPEAKER_10]: We will announce the winners a wee bit later, but for now, we've got to get back into some news, and then the Skype line.

415
00:28:02,236 --> 00:28:08,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, username on Skype, or our 800 number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

416
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:10,880
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get to those very shortly, but first, a little more news.

417
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

418
00:28:11,553 --> 00:28:18,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and apparently people were not too happy with Bioshock's way they've handled widescreen.

419
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And apparently there are some fixes, though, if you want to correct that.

420
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:35,856
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a hack that you can download for the PC version, and it will allow you to not necessarily resize your screen, but resize the view on there.

421
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:43,403
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can do all sorts of fun things, including different resolution sizes like 16.9, you know, true 16.9.

422
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:50,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Because apparently the way this game worked before is they would just kind of do like a reverse pan and scan on it.

423
00:28:50,448 --> 00:28:53,170
[SPEAKER_08]: They would cut the top and bottom off on the widescreen.

424
00:28:53,991 --> 00:29:02,898
[SPEAKER_08]: But apparently there's also, I guess, there's going to be a fix coming for Xbox 360 over Live at some point as well.

425
00:29:02,918 --> 00:29:03,779
[SPEAKER_08]: At least that's the rumor.

426
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:22,124
[SPEAKER_08]: If that's really bothering you, you can go ahead and download the patch, which is available on dl.tokaedit.com slash bioshockdfov.zip

427
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:38,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, out of curiosity, what do you think about that whole fallout about how people were really pissed about all the issues the PC was having, not just the widescreen stuff, but the fact that you could only install so many copies on one machine, and kind of like how quick they've been to respond to that.

428
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:42,672
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole widescreen thing was stupid, I think, because, I mean, personally...

429
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:48,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think anyone noticed it during the demo until someone mentioned, oh hey, by the way, this is like that.

430
00:29:48,337 --> 00:29:50,359
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all, oh my god, that's horrible!

431
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:55,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it doesn't detract anything from the game, so, big deal.

432
00:29:55,524 --> 00:29:59,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can fix it on the PC now, so, I don't know, it's not a big deal.

433
00:29:59,348 --> 00:30:01,009
[SPEAKER_08]: The cop protection thing kind of sucks.

434
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:07,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a lot of people are installing on multiple computers, which I guess technically violates some sort of

435
00:30:08,735 --> 00:30:09,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Writes or something.

436
00:30:09,596 --> 00:30:09,936
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

437
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:12,159
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a fix coming for that as well.

438
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:14,922
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think that's a big worry.

439
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:17,545
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, little bitty things.

440
00:30:19,247 --> 00:30:19,547
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

441
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,831
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100 Matt says, though, Pan and Scan ruins movies.

442
00:30:23,732 --> 00:30:24,032
[SPEAKER_10]: It does.

443
00:30:24,713 --> 00:30:25,734
[SPEAKER_11]: It absolutely does.

444
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:26,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree, actually.

445
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:27,716
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

446
00:30:28,503 --> 00:30:30,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's open up our Skype line and hear from you guys.

447
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,186
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is now open.

448
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:38,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, or you can always give us a call.

449
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,571
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.

450
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:42,892
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

451
00:30:43,853 --> 00:30:50,096
[SPEAKER_10]: And while we're waiting for those to come in, I'll just say that this is your last chance to submit your votes for Listless.

452
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:57,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I think most people in our chat room already voted, but just in case there's a couple stragglers, we'll take those.

453
00:30:58,922 --> 00:30:59,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to the phones.

454
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

455
00:31:01,664 --> 00:31:02,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

456
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:07,670
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Raven Stolfen, the guy that got... Damn, you get through first every time.

457
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,230
[SPEAKER_10]: How is that?

458
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,591
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, what's on your mind, Raven Stolfen?

459
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:12,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a fast finger and a new keyboard.

460
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:14,495
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll leave the fast finger comment as is.

461
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:15,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what's on your mind?

462
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:16,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Lame, mean finger.

463
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:23,223
[SPEAKER_00]: My comment tonight is you mentioned that Nintendo surpassed the 360?

464
00:31:24,264 --> 00:31:26,566
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of worldwide sales, yes.

465
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:35,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I know this is going to turn into a flame world real fast and real quick, so I'll try to keep the flames to a minimum.

466
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:39,830
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I believe that people that buy in the Wii is not us hardcore gamers.

467
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:45,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we bought it, I bought it, you bought it, Loki bought it, DarkSakura bought it, but those soccer moms of the world.

468
00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:49,317
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I totally agree with you, but a sale's a sale, right?

469
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:50,538
[SPEAKER_10]: A sale's a sale.

470
00:31:50,938 --> 00:31:51,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Money's money, right?

471
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:53,160
[SPEAKER_10]: The bottom line is a dollar.

472
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,143
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I will say this, what I would be curious to see...

473
00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:00,640
[SPEAKER_10]: is how many games per system is out there, you know what I mean?

474
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:05,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a 360 owner probably has a lot of games at this point, whereas a Wii owner maybe doesn't have so many games.

475
00:32:05,903 --> 00:32:11,806
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know, that may not be true, because then again, you look at the games that are out on the Wii, there's not a lot for hardcore gamers.

476
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:21,151
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's some, you know, your Super Paper Mario, your Metroid, but there is a lot of crap out there on the Wii, like, you know, your Happy Feets, your, well, I haven't played Boogie, but I don't know.

477
00:32:21,718 --> 00:32:25,699
[SPEAKER_00]: But that commercial really wants me to, I'm memorized about that commercial, Boogie.

478
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:29,061
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost wants me to buy it, but my mind goes like, don't buy it.

479
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:29,781
[SPEAKER_00]: It's junk.

480
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy it.

481
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't fall for it.

482
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:34,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never seen the commercial, but I don't watch TV.

483
00:32:34,923 --> 00:32:35,443
[SPEAKER_11]: What's it like?

484
00:32:37,383 --> 00:32:40,164
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, they're doing a disco one, and they're like doing the Wii mode.

485
00:32:40,204 --> 00:32:41,725
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with the game.

486
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:43,566
[SPEAKER_00]: No gameplay footage whatsoever.

487
00:32:43,986 --> 00:32:45,926
[SPEAKER_00]: But the commercials, I think it was great.

488
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:47,227
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm like, wow.

489
00:32:47,527 --> 00:32:48,287
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like fun.

490
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:50,648
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I smack myself going like, shit, it's not fun.

491
00:32:51,286 --> 00:33:01,752
[SPEAKER_06]: But they do show you how to actually play the game in the commercial because they do have the Wiimote and the Nunchuck moving back and forth and what I assume is how you're supposed to play that piece of crap game.

492
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:06,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I smack myself and then... I can rent it for free.

493
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, renting might be a thing to do.

494
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:15,680
[SPEAKER_10]: RossDealUT says, Problem is that most people are just buying it as a Wii Sports machine and will never buy anything for it.

495
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what about Wii Play, though?

496
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Wii Play's been selling a lot.

497
00:33:18,368 --> 00:33:20,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And how come the PlayStation 2 is still selling?

498
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Gold Banjo, I think same reason, actually.

499
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:25,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Gold Banjo says, my little sister sings along during that commercial.

500
00:33:25,913 --> 00:33:30,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the PlayStation 2 continues to sell because they're A, cheap, and B, there's a shitload of games for it.

501
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:33,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, just massive and massive amounts of games for it.

502
00:33:34,758 --> 00:33:35,898
[SPEAKER_10]: So, all right.

503
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:36,419
[SPEAKER_10]: One more thing.

504
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:37,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, one more thing, sir.

505
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:47,045
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the new release of Bioshock came out, and I was just wondering, do you think this game's going to be buried like Dead Rising when it came out, when the first...

506
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:52,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead Rising is one of those games that everyone loved, played, you know, Loki loved it, I loved it.

507
00:33:52,715 --> 00:33:57,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Bioshock going to fall under that, like, we love it and we leave it for, like, another game?

508
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:02,943
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to take a very controversial stance here, and I'm going to say yes, it will fall off the radar.

509
00:34:03,393 --> 00:34:03,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Death Rising

510
00:34:30,214 --> 00:34:32,235
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the lack of multiplayer is really going to hurt the game.

511
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:38,817
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, I think Bioshock will trump Halo 3 on some end-of-year best list.

512
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:42,999
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think you may see a small resurgence come the end of the year during award times.

513
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:47,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm just saying that because, you know, this game has, you know, everyone loved it.

514
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:49,141
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, you know.

515
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:50,222
[SPEAKER_00]: DOOM DOOM DOOM

516
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,714
[SPEAKER_11]: My hand is raised because we were playing it recently.

517
00:35:13,874 --> 00:35:16,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, so one person on the entire internet is playing it.

518
00:35:16,516 --> 00:35:16,996
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

519
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:18,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the most important person on the internet.

520
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:27,641
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I look at my friends list, I do not see people playing a lot of the old arcade releases except for a few big, big biggies like Geometry Wars.

521
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:30,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Pac-Man Championship Edition still comes up.

522
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:32,584
[SPEAKER_10]: So, a couple of those.

523
00:35:33,788 --> 00:35:34,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

524
00:35:59,063 --> 00:36:02,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Ross Steel UT says lots of people play games and don't go on live.

525
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:10,731
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true, but I'm using the rationalization that you have to go on live to get the game in the first place unless it was on that arcade unplugged disc.

526
00:36:10,811 --> 00:36:12,773
[SPEAKER_10]: But I truly think that's a minority.

527
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:13,913
[SPEAKER_00]: One more comment.

528
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:17,436
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think with a mall that's so big would have more bathrooms.

529
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:18,036
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

530
00:36:18,697 --> 00:36:18,997
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

531
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:20,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Raven's off and we've got to let you go.

532
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,639
[SPEAKER_10]: But have a good one, buddy, okay?

533
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:22,119
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

534
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:22,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

535
00:36:22,499 --> 00:36:22,739
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

536
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if you want to give us a call, our number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

537
00:36:28,968 --> 00:36:32,290
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Orange Lounge Radio 1-877-GAME-OLR Orange Lounge Radio

538
00:36:59,988 --> 00:37:02,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories while I change this real quick here?

539
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:03,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I do.

540
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:03,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

541
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Give us one real quick.

542
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, real quick.

543
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:15,015
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some interesting things coming out about the brand new Brain Age 2 DS, the one that, you know, red and black, whatever.

544
00:37:15,355 --> 00:37:20,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, the LCD screen's a little bit dimmer than the normal DS Lite.

545
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:21,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh.

546
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:23,218
[SPEAKER_08]: That sucks for people that bought it.

547
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:26,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

548
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:27,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Enter interesting things.

549
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:35,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there was a PSP petition for Resident Evil coming onto the PSP.

550
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:45,252
[SPEAKER_08]: It got the attention of Capcom, who says if you get over 10,000 signatures, that will draw significant attention.

551
00:37:46,252 --> 00:37:53,454
[SPEAKER_08]: And now they're up to 17,000 signatures, so maybe we'll see a PSP version of Resident Evil.

552
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:56,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, I fixed Skype, so save the rest for a little later.

553
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:56,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty.

554
00:37:57,515 --> 00:37:57,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

555
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:58,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you do that?

556
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:00,248
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 Game Boy Color Games

557
00:38:20,316 --> 00:38:21,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Black and White Mario Bros.

558
00:38:43,627 --> 00:38:44,488
[SPEAKER_08]: On the big screen TV?

559
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:45,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it just wouldn't look good.

560
00:38:46,389 --> 00:38:55,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I would actually like to see them port crappy Metroid 2 from Game Boy onto the virtual console because that game was a pain to play on the original Game Boy.

561
00:38:55,854 --> 00:38:58,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I think actually playing it on TV would make it a worthwhile experience.

562
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:02,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Or how about they do a Metroid All-Stars where they just redesign the game?

563
00:39:02,517 --> 00:39:03,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be good too.

564
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:04,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Upgrade the graphics.

565
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:07,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and Kid Icarus on Game Boy, even though I'm not sure if it's...

566
00:39:07,952 --> 00:39:10,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't really know a lot of good Game Boy games.

567
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:12,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, there are the games that I grew up with, and that's about it.

568
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
[SPEAKER_01]: What got you thinking about this?

569
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,921
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, just randomly, I guess.

570
00:39:43,161 --> 00:39:43,661
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all good.

571
00:39:44,341 --> 00:40:01,125
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what would actually be really cool, though, would be, like, even though the DS doesn't play the old, old Game Boy games, it would be kind of cool if, like, there was that functionality between the DS and the Wii a little later on, which we all know there is some functionality there, where maybe you could download a virtual console game from the Game Boy and play it on your DS.

572
00:40:01,605 --> 00:40:02,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that be kind of neat?

573
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:07,796
[SPEAKER_01]: If Mr. Spankin wins the list list, I'll make videos of myself killing patients in trauma center.

574
00:40:23,132 --> 00:40:28,174
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so if Mr. Spanky wins Listless, you're going to kill patients in trauma centers and put it on the YouTubes.

575
00:40:28,474 --> 00:40:30,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're going to find out very soon what won.

576
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:37,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Just out of curiosity, can you describe your hatred of Mr. Spanky to the listeners who may not be familiar with the character?

577
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:40,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I heard his voice.

578
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:50,022
[SPEAKER_01]: on a large media presence ago, and, well, I didn't really like it.

579
00:40:50,503 --> 00:40:51,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

580
00:40:51,444 --> 00:40:53,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, you know that wasn't the official voice, right?

581
00:40:53,445 --> 00:40:55,847
[SPEAKER_10]: That was just some idiot pretending, right?

582
00:40:57,308 --> 00:40:57,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

583
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:01,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I am noticing there is no article on Mr. Spanky on Wikipedia.

584
00:41:01,551 --> 00:41:05,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I was hoping for some pictures or something, like an article I could refer people to, but there's nothing.

585
00:41:05,935 --> 00:41:06,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you spell it with an E?

586
00:41:07,636 --> 00:41:08,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I did it both ways.

587
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:11,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I did it once with an E and once with no E. Yeah, DDRPC.

588
00:41:11,819 --> 00:41:12,940
[SPEAKER_10]: DDRPC, let me see.

589
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:18,261
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there's no DDR PC article either.

590
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:21,863
[SPEAKER_10]: There's just a Dance Dance Revolution main article.

591
00:41:22,704 --> 00:41:25,045
[SPEAKER_10]: How is there no Mr. Spanky article on Wikipedia?

592
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:26,926
[SPEAKER_10]: He's an important part of the culture.

593
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's a DDR character.

594
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:32,410
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really deserve their own Wikipedia articles.

595
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,190
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't get it.

596
00:41:33,631 --> 00:41:33,931
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

597
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:35,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sick of looking.

598
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:36,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, no, I'm not.

599
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:36,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Windows PC.

600
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:39,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's no article for the Windows PC version of Dance Dance Revolution.

601
00:41:40,015 --> 00:41:40,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadness.

602
00:41:41,676 --> 00:41:41,936
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

603
00:41:42,477 --> 00:41:43,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I'm done.

604
00:41:43,984 --> 00:41:45,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to share with us, GS68?

605
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:47,265
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm good.

606
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,007
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, have a good one, GS68.

607
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:50,767
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll talk to you next time.

608
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:52,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, you too.

609
00:41:52,668 --> 00:41:53,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

610
00:41:54,528 --> 00:42:00,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping one of our Wikipedia faithful will somehow create that Mr. Spanky article.

611
00:42:00,391 --> 00:42:01,411
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be all kinds of awesome.

612
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:02,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to another call.

613
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:03,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

614
00:42:03,712 --> 00:42:04,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

615
00:42:05,072 --> 00:42:06,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guys, it's Insanist.

616
00:42:06,873 --> 00:42:08,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Insanist.

617
00:42:08,434 --> 00:42:09,214
[SPEAKER_10]: What is on your mind?

618
00:42:10,921 --> 00:42:18,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys know, but that Penny Arcade Expo thing went on, and if you can tell, I have absolutely no voice from being at it all weekend.

619
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:19,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wow.

620
00:42:19,846 --> 00:42:21,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Penny Arcade Expo should happen more often.

621
00:42:21,908 --> 00:42:22,668
[SPEAKER_10]: It kills your voice.

622
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:24,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, fuck you too, buddy.

623
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,190
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

624
00:42:25,683 --> 00:42:26,523
[SPEAKER_10]: PENNY ARCADE EXPO

625
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:50,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to the wedding on Saturday.

626
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:52,259
[SPEAKER_10]: So congratulations, Amanda and Tom.

627
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Wave, wave, wave, hug.

628
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:55,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I know they don't listen to this program.

629
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:56,999
[SPEAKER_10]: But they got married, so I had to go.

630
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how was Penny Arcade Expo?

631
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,980
[SPEAKER_10]: So you were there.

632
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,300
[SPEAKER_10]: You were our man on the street.

633
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,080
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going on?

634
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what was really disappointing was Sony really didn't bring much to the show.

635
00:43:10,062 --> 00:43:16,923
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, it was something outside of Sony's boot that was for the PlayStation 3, which I gave the unofficial OLR seal of approval.

636
00:43:17,323 --> 00:43:18,703
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this game called Eye of Judgment.

637
00:43:19,604 --> 00:43:22,165
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a collectible card game that works with the PS3.

638
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:26,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute, you gave the OLR award to the Eye of Judgment?

639
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:26,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

640
00:43:27,245 --> 00:43:27,645
[SPEAKER_04]: FIRED!

641
00:43:28,986 --> 00:43:29,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you played it?

642
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:30,646
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I haven't.

643
00:43:31,106 --> 00:43:33,707
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw the tech demo and I was like, why?

644
00:43:33,767 --> 00:43:36,507
[SPEAKER_10]: We did kind of see it at E3, so I'm curious.

645
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,927
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're being completely serious.

646
00:43:39,107 --> 00:43:39,908
[SPEAKER_10]: This game is awesome.

647
00:43:40,408 --> 00:43:42,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I won't give it the OLR, I'll give it the STFU.

648
00:43:43,308 --> 00:43:44,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave that for you guys.

649
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:46,169
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, that's fine, but I'm just curious.

650
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:47,249
[SPEAKER_04]: You're absolutely serious.

651
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:47,929
[SPEAKER_04]: This game rocked.

652
00:43:49,153 --> 00:43:50,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I thoroughly enjoyed it.

653
00:43:50,114 --> 00:43:57,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a huge CCG fan and obviously I'm a huge video game fan and this was a very good combination of the two.

654
00:43:57,537 --> 00:44:02,479
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt more interactive to me than just putting a piece of cardboard on a table.

655
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:09,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I could actually see what was going on and I thought the technology was good and it was something different, which I'm always welcome to seeing.

656
00:44:12,043 --> 00:44:12,903
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics were great.

657
00:44:12,923 --> 00:44:15,084
[SPEAKER_04]: There weren't any glitches with reading the cards.

658
00:44:16,212 --> 00:44:17,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no problem with it.

659
00:44:17,273 --> 00:44:19,734
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, Sony didn't bring much else to the table.

660
00:44:20,755 --> 00:44:21,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so I get it.

661
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:26,639
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're giving the award to Eye of Judgment by default because there were no other games there.

662
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:28,741
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing new from Sony there.

663
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:29,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

664
00:44:30,402 --> 00:44:32,923
[SPEAKER_10]: But was Eye of Judgment the best thing you saw on any system?

665
00:44:34,124 --> 00:44:34,324
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

666
00:44:36,286 --> 00:44:37,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be getting to that.

667
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:42,230
[SPEAKER_04]: But my Wii award goes to Metroid Prime 3.

668
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,532
[SPEAKER_04]: This game's amazing and you need to all pick it up next week.

669
00:44:46,024 --> 00:44:46,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

670
00:44:47,725 --> 00:44:50,807
[SPEAKER_04]: One, it has the best Wii remote controls I've ever seen.

671
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:56,491
[SPEAKER_04]: The looking is fantastic, the shooting is fantastic, the motion controls are very intuitive and a lot of fun.

672
00:44:57,352 --> 00:44:58,993
[SPEAKER_10]: But I didn't like Prime 1 and 2.

673
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:00,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I take that back.

674
00:45:00,094 --> 00:45:04,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of like Prime 2, the multiplayer mode, but I found first-person Metroid so hard to play.

675
00:45:04,837 --> 00:45:07,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I going to suddenly get over it with number 3?

676
00:45:07,379 --> 00:45:08,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Will it bring me back?

677
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:09,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it will.

678
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:14,444
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion controls really make you feel like a part of the game and some of the boss battles are amazing.

679
00:45:15,431 --> 00:45:17,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to demo the Ridley boss battle.

680
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:24,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to spoil too much, but it was one of the coolest boss battles I've ever fought.

681
00:45:24,653 --> 00:45:24,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever.

682
00:45:25,513 --> 00:45:26,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get a rise out of it?

683
00:45:27,694 --> 00:45:29,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes I did, and not down there.

684
00:45:29,554 --> 00:45:31,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Did it make you feel excited in a special place?

685
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:33,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes.

686
00:45:34,115 --> 00:45:37,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have to go back to your hotel room and take care of some business after playing the demo?

687
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:40,876
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because I had to go run tournaments, unfortunately.

688
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:41,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I see.

689
00:45:41,776 --> 00:45:43,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so how about your Xbox 360 award?

690
00:45:45,278 --> 00:45:47,539
[SPEAKER_04]: and overall award, Rock Band.

691
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,499
[SPEAKER_04]: No question, this game is amazing.

692
00:45:50,919 --> 00:45:54,600
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, I know everybody in the chat room is like, hey, I've played this before.

693
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Guitar Freaks Drum Mania.

694
00:45:57,061 --> 00:46:00,241
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're right, it is Guitar Freaks Drum Mania and Karaoke Revolution.

695
00:46:00,602 --> 00:46:03,222
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's with songs that the mainstream people are going to know.

696
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:06,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to sell a lot of copies and make Harmonix a lot of money.

697
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:09,043
[SPEAKER_04]: The interface is great.

698
00:46:09,584 --> 00:46:10,604
[SPEAKER_04]: The controllers are great.

699
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:16,693
[SPEAKER_04]: The guitars for Rock Band feel like real guitars.

700
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:22,794
[SPEAKER_04]: The fret buttons are colored on the top of the controller, rather, on the buttons themselves.

701
00:46:24,234 --> 00:46:26,114
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the same layout as guitar here.

702
00:46:26,194 --> 00:46:27,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my question for you.

703
00:46:27,275 --> 00:46:30,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think if Rock Band does well, there'll be a pop band that comes out?

704
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:38,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, I like shitty music, and there's just not a lot... I mean, Rock Band actually has a lot of good music in it, but I like shitty music.

705
00:46:38,577 --> 00:46:41,017
[SPEAKER_10]: So is there any hope for me in my love of pop music?

706
00:46:41,736 --> 00:46:44,917
[SPEAKER_04]: If you would have brought me that question, I would have asked the Harmonix guys.

707
00:46:45,357 --> 00:46:45,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn you.

708
00:46:46,438 --> 00:46:50,939
[SPEAKER_04]: But with them releasing Guitar Hero 80s, anything can happen.

709
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:52,940
[SPEAKER_04]: So, actually, I honestly wouldn't rule that out.

710
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot of the songs in Guitar Hero 80s weren't that great.

711
00:46:56,781 --> 00:47:02,022
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I think pop band could very well be a viable idea.

712
00:47:02,082 --> 00:47:07,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to comments from the chat room here, Zaku says, Excuse me, sir, but Harmonix fucked up the drums.

713
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:08,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Nuff said.

714
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:09,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you used them?

715
00:47:11,497 --> 00:47:13,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, you can't respond in time.

716
00:47:13,279 --> 00:47:14,179
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you didn't.

717
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,561
[SPEAKER_04]: They're great.

718
00:47:15,601 --> 00:47:16,681
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very responsive.

719
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:21,986
[SPEAKER_04]: My only beef is the Xbox button is in the way of the rightmost two drums.

720
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:22,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn that Xbox button.

721
00:47:22,827 --> 00:47:24,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And that got annoying a couple of times.

722
00:47:24,848 --> 00:47:27,170
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw says, Rob, don't give them any ideas.

723
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:29,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Next thing you know, there will be a game called Boy Band.

724
00:47:30,653 --> 00:47:32,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Miklatov got all excited over there.

725
00:47:33,636 --> 00:47:35,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's called SingStar, actually.

726
00:47:35,577 --> 00:47:37,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is probably called SingStar.

727
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:38,440
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be so much fun.

728
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:39,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Halo 3 is the final.

729
00:48:03,844 --> 00:48:05,004
[SPEAKER_04]: They showed two new maps.

730
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:10,046
[SPEAKER_04]: One was called Narrows, which is a hallway with vehicles, and it was a hell of a lot of fun.

731
00:48:11,026 --> 00:48:17,848
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one was called Guardian, which looked very base-like and showed off jump pads and elevators and was really cool.

732
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:19,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Some new weapons.

733
00:48:19,988 --> 00:48:21,608
[SPEAKER_04]: A flamethrower will be in the game.

734
00:48:23,549 --> 00:48:24,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire grenades will be in the game.

735
00:48:25,729 --> 00:48:27,350
[SPEAKER_04]: A Spartan laser will be in the game.

736
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And this item called the Gravity Hammer, which is the sword on steroids.

737
00:48:31,651 --> 00:48:31,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

738
00:48:33,086 --> 00:48:33,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

739
00:48:34,087 --> 00:48:35,208
[SPEAKER_10]: How did Halo 3 look?

740
00:48:35,268 --> 00:48:37,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Because a lot of people complained the beta didn't look that much better.

741
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,251
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked really good.

742
00:48:39,571 --> 00:48:39,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Did it?

743
00:48:40,112 --> 00:48:41,233
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked very good.

744
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:45,216
[SPEAKER_04]: What I was most impressed with was the heads-up display.

745
00:48:45,816 --> 00:48:47,918
[SPEAKER_04]: It got a big overhaul from Halo 2.

746
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:56,165
[SPEAKER_04]: The shield meter is directly top-center on the screen, so you'll be seeing it at all times.

747
00:48:56,505 --> 00:48:56,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

748
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:03,163
[SPEAKER_04]: They have your weapons and ammo in the upper right corner, and it has icons and the button.

749
00:49:03,203 --> 00:49:05,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of saying, press this button to pick up this now.

750
00:49:06,624 --> 00:49:14,185
[SPEAKER_04]: They streamlined it a lot, and I really, really think this will get rid of the disappointment that, at least in my opinion, was Halo 2.

751
00:49:14,925 --> 00:49:15,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

752
00:49:15,546 --> 00:49:16,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Gold Banjo says, yay fire.

753
00:49:17,046 --> 00:49:19,586
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68, though, asks, any word on the man cannon?

754
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:27,088
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not see a man cannon, but there is a fire cannon that you could...

755
00:49:28,161 --> 00:49:31,642
[SPEAKER_04]: It was mounted, but you could yank it out and run after people with it, which is pretty cool.

756
00:49:31,922 --> 00:49:32,222
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

757
00:49:32,522 --> 00:49:37,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anything else you want to share from Penny Arcade Expo since you were lucky enough to go?

758
00:49:37,764 --> 00:49:38,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Two things.

759
00:49:38,384 --> 00:49:41,545
[SPEAKER_04]: One, the frag doll stole a flowchart about boobs that I made.

760
00:49:42,865 --> 00:49:46,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And two, Wil Wheaton kicked my ass at Guitar Hero.

761
00:49:46,646 --> 00:49:47,907
[SPEAKER_04]: You poor thing.

762
00:49:48,787 --> 00:49:49,647
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty cool.

763
00:49:49,667 --> 00:49:50,668
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a good sport about it.

764
00:49:51,128 --> 00:49:51,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

765
00:49:52,196 --> 00:49:53,096
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's about it.

766
00:49:53,316 --> 00:49:54,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Penny Arcade Expo is great.

767
00:49:54,677 --> 00:49:55,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish you guys were there.

768
00:49:56,097 --> 00:49:58,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, how the hell did you end up playing Guitar Hero with Will Wheaton?

769
00:49:58,378 --> 00:49:59,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it just by chance?

770
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:01,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Matt and he entered the tournament beforehand.

771
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,861
[SPEAKER_04]: He was in there warming up and asked if I could get a game with him because I'm probably not going to get a chance to play.

772
00:50:05,901 --> 00:50:06,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, sure.

773
00:50:06,681 --> 00:50:10,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And we played Let's Talk More Rock Expert and he kicked my ass.

774
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:10,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

775
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:12,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Something else.

776
00:50:13,363 --> 00:50:13,683
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

777
00:50:13,763 --> 00:50:16,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Insanus, thank you so much for the call.

778
00:50:16,584 --> 00:50:18,665
[SPEAKER_10]: And real quick plug for your show if you'd like.

779
00:50:19,695 --> 00:50:46,962
[SPEAKER_04]: STFU every Thursday at 7 followed by the Insanest Hour if I'm up to it whenever STFU is over alright good to see that there is some weekday programming still happening on the station on Thursdays and occasionally on Tuesdays not so much on Wednesdays and if I have any spare swag left over I will either be giving it to you guys or away to listeners hoorah more on that on Thursday alright speaking of Tuesday I will be live this week

780
00:50:48,438 --> 00:50:49,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, I have something to do on Tuesday.

781
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:52,000
[SPEAKER_11]: But I won't be here on next Sunday.

782
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,002
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will not be here on Wednesday because I'm in L.A.

783
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:55,502
[SPEAKER_10]: for four days.

784
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:58,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be here next Sunday because of something very special.

785
00:50:58,903 --> 00:51:01,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Rob, can I have one more request?

786
00:51:02,445 --> 00:51:04,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let Jamie finish your thought and then you can have your turn.

787
00:51:05,086 --> 00:51:05,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Jamie.

788
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,728
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the weekend of my second wedding anniversary.

789
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:09,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, congratulations.

790
00:51:09,348 --> 00:51:10,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay, Jamie.

791
00:51:10,509 --> 00:51:14,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I will be making Dan buy me expensive food on Saturday.

792
00:51:14,531 --> 00:51:15,992
[SPEAKER_11]: He's taking me to Weird Al on Sunday.

793
00:51:16,012 --> 00:51:16,712
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

794
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,057
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be an interesting show Sunday because Labor Day weekend and everything.

795
00:51:21,117 --> 00:51:21,737
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

796
00:51:22,077 --> 00:51:23,538
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be here if we do a drunk show.

797
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:25,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

798
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:26,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

799
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

800
00:51:28,721 --> 00:51:30,561
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I don't have any plans for Monday.

801
00:51:32,863 --> 00:51:33,503
[SPEAKER_10]: The plot thickens.

802
00:51:33,543 --> 00:51:34,844
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, DM, what was your one more thought?

803
00:51:36,364 --> 00:51:37,785
[SPEAKER_04]: You haven't hung up on me in a while.

804
00:51:38,205 --> 00:51:38,645
[SPEAKER_10]: You're right.

805
00:51:38,886 --> 00:51:39,706
[SPEAKER_10]: So I should do that now.

806
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:52,258
[SPEAKER_10]: DMN goes by Insanus now.

807
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:52,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why.

808
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:54,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did Prince change his name?

809
00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:54,839
[SPEAKER_10]: He just did.

810
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,382
[SPEAKER_11]: No, he did because his name was copyrighted by the label he was on before.

811
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you always have to know everything?

812
00:52:00,724 --> 00:52:00,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

813
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:06,516
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN slash Insanus slash whatever your name is going to be tomorrow.

814
00:52:07,316 --> 00:52:14,522
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't sign on to WoW, I'm going to get somebody to kick you out of the guild because you're being too inactive and I don't like that.

815
00:52:15,103 --> 00:52:15,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

816
00:52:16,724 --> 00:52:18,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well I'd like to go to another call now.

817
00:52:19,226 --> 00:52:21,528
[SPEAKER_10]: You can use your WoW guild chat some other time.

818
00:52:21,548 --> 00:52:26,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, you can't kick him from the guild because you don't have WoW.

819
00:52:26,992 --> 00:52:28,193
[SPEAKER_10]: You had to cancel WoW.

820
00:52:28,714 --> 00:52:30,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we've got to go back to the phones.

821
00:52:30,095 --> 00:52:31,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

822
00:52:31,056 --> 00:52:31,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

823
00:52:32,256 --> 00:52:32,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's AZHP!

824
00:52:59,025 --> 00:52:59,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm there.

825
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:27,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't play that much.

826
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:30,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of people who leveled to level 5 and then quit.

827
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:32,727
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I got to 8 with my team and then I started.

828
00:53:32,747 --> 00:53:33,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, 8.

829
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:35,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay, okay.

830
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:38,732
[SPEAKER_11]: I will play World of Warcraft on Sunday.

831
00:53:40,473 --> 00:53:42,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, and DMN sent me a private message.

832
00:53:42,655 --> 00:53:43,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell me Glotov I quit WoW.

833
00:53:45,377 --> 00:53:46,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'm sad.

834
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:47,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

835
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, sorry, AZHP has been waiting on the line very patiently.

836
00:53:50,802 --> 00:53:51,462
[SPEAKER_10]: You poor bastard.

837
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:52,023
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

838
00:53:52,043 --> 00:53:53,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

839
00:53:53,795 --> 00:54:02,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of WoW, you know, after I got off the phone last week with you guys, you said that I might have bought this budget computer for WoW, and no, I'm not a WoW player.

840
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:03,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

841
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:10,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, because that's right, you emailed us, and we said something about you had the budget... You said something about buying a budget computer, right?

842
00:54:11,346 --> 00:54:19,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, I Skyped in last week, and I said that I bought a budget computer, and you thought that it was for WoW, and no, I've seen what WoW does to my friends, and I...

843
00:54:20,518 --> 00:54:22,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to become a recovering WoW addict.

844
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Ironic that we're yelling about WoW the minute you call in.

845
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,222
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why you were snickering to yourself.

846
00:54:27,662 --> 00:54:28,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that all you wanted to say?

847
00:54:29,564 --> 00:54:29,844
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

848
00:54:31,425 --> 00:54:34,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I didn't catch the mailbag this week.

849
00:54:34,887 --> 00:54:36,208
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys read my email?

850
00:54:37,529 --> 00:54:38,209
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

851
00:54:38,229 --> 00:54:38,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

852
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:42,972
[SPEAKER_10]: We read a lot of emails, so I don't know if we – I think I heard your name come up.

853
00:54:43,772 --> 00:54:44,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, awesome.

854
00:54:44,412 --> 00:54:45,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

855
00:54:45,173 --> 00:54:49,095
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you could always just download Part A, and then you'll find out.

856
00:54:50,376 --> 00:54:51,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

857
00:54:52,057 --> 00:54:56,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I played the Bioshock demo, and I was looking at picking it up because it's so awesome, right?

858
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, we read this email, yeah.

859
00:54:59,142 --> 00:55:12,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I just read a lot of controversy on the forums, like, oh, if you buy the game, you can only register it on two computers, and after that, your CD won't work anymore on any other computers that you have.

860
00:55:13,217 --> 00:55:17,380
[SPEAKER_10]: That and your computer will be reported to the Motion Picture Association of America.

861
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Why they do that, I don't know, but it's just more negative stuff to happen.

862
00:55:21,323 --> 00:55:28,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And little gnomes will come live inside your computer, and if you don't feed them before midnight, then your computer will grow legs and walk away.

863
00:55:28,988 --> 00:55:31,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the coffee protection on Bioshock is just that bad.

864
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:37,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually, people have said that root kits were installed, like Sony's old root kits that

865
00:55:38,439 --> 00:55:40,861
[SPEAKER_05]: and pretty much just monitored everything on your computer.

866
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:49,407
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm thinking of waiting until that stuff gets all settled down, people start throwing lawsuits at 2K and stuff, more lawsuits.

867
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:55,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, actually Big Brother is watching your computer and sending daily reports to Amber who's crying about them right now.

868
00:55:57,012 --> 00:55:57,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Bad joke, sorry.

869
00:55:58,113 --> 00:55:59,654
[SPEAKER_10]: If you get that, you need a life like I do.

870
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:00,955
[SPEAKER_10]: See, Miklatov's booing me.

871
00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:01,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I know he needs it.

872
00:56:01,475 --> 00:56:01,715
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

873
00:56:03,176 --> 00:56:04,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to share, ACHP?

874
00:56:07,018 --> 00:56:11,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably, but it all got lost in the randomness, so I guess that's about it.

875
00:56:11,262 --> 00:56:15,807
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like the tagline of this show, it all gets lost in the randomness, so there you go.

876
00:56:16,447 --> 00:56:17,348
[SPEAKER_05]: That is pretty excellent.

877
00:56:17,508 --> 00:56:19,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, actually, one more thing.

878
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:19,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

879
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:30,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, about the Wii outselling the Xbox 360, and you guys are all wondering, oh, it's not the hardcore gamers who's buying all the stuff for it, it's just Wii Sports, Wii Play.

880
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's a mix, it's a mix.

881
00:56:32,648 --> 00:56:35,029
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, keep in mind we were reading some chat comments there too.

882
00:56:35,149 --> 00:56:36,089
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a mix.

883
00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:41,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you've got both the hardcore gamers and soccer moms buying it, and that's why it's doing so well.

884
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:45,191
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think for a lot of hardcore gamers, the magic is dying off.

885
00:56:45,751 --> 00:56:49,332
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully Metroid is going to bring that back, and Super Smash Bros.

886
00:56:49,412 --> 00:56:50,632
[SPEAKER_10]: certainly will bring that back.

887
00:56:50,732 --> 00:56:54,653
[SPEAKER_10]: But I feel like it's the DS launch all over again.

888
00:56:54,693 --> 00:56:54,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Really.

889
00:56:55,674 --> 00:56:56,834
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the DS launch all over again.

890
00:56:56,854 --> 00:57:01,455
[SPEAKER_10]: You had a bunch of great games at the beginning, and then like a year of deadness with the occasional gem.

891
00:57:02,091 --> 00:57:03,772
[SPEAKER_10]: and now we're going to get back into Overdrive.

892
00:57:04,312 --> 00:57:10,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean like from next week until four months from now we got like great releases coming every month.

893
00:57:10,435 --> 00:57:18,939
[SPEAKER_05]: You got Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Brothers, you got Battalion Wars, everything's just like coming out one after another.

894
00:57:18,959 --> 00:57:21,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's about freaking time, right?

895
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.

896
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:22,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

897
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:26,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't bought a new game for my Wii since Elevates.

898
00:57:27,136 --> 00:57:30,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the last one I bought was Super Paper Mario and I barely played it.

899
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:33,478
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like a dummy for even buying it because I barely played it.

900
00:57:34,358 --> 00:57:34,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well.

901
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,859
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, ACHP, thanks so much for the call.

902
00:57:36,879 --> 00:57:38,199
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to go and wrap things up, okay?

903
00:57:38,899 --> 00:57:39,379
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, then.

904
00:57:39,439 --> 00:57:40,199
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, later, sir.

905
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:41,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

906
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:41,940
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

907
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,640
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

908
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,721
[SPEAKER_10]: If you didn't get through, so sorry, but try again next week.

909
00:57:45,741 --> 00:57:48,982
[SPEAKER_10]: We had some long calls tonight that kind of took up all our time.

910
00:57:49,062 --> 00:57:53,103
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're mad we didn't get to your call, just blame Insanus because his call went on for about nine minutes.

911
00:57:54,051 --> 00:57:54,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

912
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:59,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to the listless results, shall we, before we get to the last-minute stories.

913
00:57:59,453 --> 00:58:01,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you still had some last-minute stories, right, Loki?

914
00:58:01,494 --> 00:58:01,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

915
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:04,835
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe DarkSakura has a few as well?

916
00:58:05,475 --> 00:58:05,795
[SPEAKER_11]: You know.

917
00:58:06,095 --> 00:58:06,335
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

918
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:07,056
[SPEAKER_10]: You know.

919
00:58:08,096 --> 00:58:08,376
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

920
00:58:09,316 --> 00:58:11,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to tonight's listless results.

921
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:22,221
[SPEAKER_10]: In third place for the character we would most like to see in the new track and field game, Dracula is the character that people would like to see third most in their DDR games.

922
00:58:22,828 --> 00:58:31,717
[SPEAKER_10]: In second place for character that we most want to see in track and field, Mr. Spanky comes in second place.

923
00:58:32,438 --> 00:58:34,359
[SPEAKER_10]: And what could possibly top Mr. Spanky?

924
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:43,608
[SPEAKER_10]: For the number one character you most want to see in track and field on the DS, the left DDR arrow is the number one.

925
00:58:44,409 --> 00:58:44,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

926
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,212
[SPEAKER_10]: So make it happen, Konami.

927
00:58:48,081 --> 00:58:49,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Heart, Hearts Make It Better

928
00:59:16,581 --> 00:59:17,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't throw napkins at me.

929
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:18,803
[SPEAKER_10]: That will just make me meaner.

930
00:59:18,863 --> 00:59:19,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Mikotov.

931
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:28,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I realized like 10 minutes ago that it would have been better to do the right DDR arrow because it's pointing in the direction of like the running on the screen.

932
00:59:28,468 --> 00:59:31,290
[SPEAKER_06]: The lefty arrow makes even less sense now that I think about it.

933
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:32,371
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes you run away.

934
00:59:32,711 --> 00:59:34,012
[SPEAKER_10]: But it makes it funnier.

935
00:59:34,752 --> 00:59:36,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, Loki, last minute stories.

936
00:59:37,094 --> 00:59:37,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

937
00:59:39,012 --> 00:59:39,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

938
00:59:40,052 --> 00:59:47,657
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was some other stuff other than the Eye of Judgment announced for the PlayStation Eye.

939
00:59:48,638 --> 00:59:57,924
[SPEAKER_08]: One of which is the Towers of Topok, which is apparently a game where you roll around this giant ball down this tower using your body.

940
00:59:58,085 --> 00:59:59,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like a shitload of fun.

941
00:59:59,626 --> 01:00:01,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Hurrah.

942
01:00:01,047 --> 01:00:01,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Hurrah.

943
01:00:02,689 --> 01:00:28,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I will use the eye of judgment to roll a giant ball down a hill is what you're saying something like that you know hooray that sounds like totem ball I love totem ball it's not exactly a totem ball and basically it's a top-down view and each of the little platforms that you're on is actually an image of your screen so you actually are on multiple platforms there I don't know it's weird not something I would buy though um

944
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:30,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

945
01:00:31,107 --> 01:00:50,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, which is rumored to be out this year, according to an interview with some people working the Sony booth at Leipzig, that actually, I guess, with the series creator, Kazunori Yamauchi,

946
01:00:52,964 --> 01:00:54,205
[SPEAKER_08]: has confirmed himself.

947
01:00:54,245 --> 01:01:00,250
[SPEAKER_08]: He said that, yes, it will be a free download on the PSN, and we're thinking of charging, but doubt it.

948
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:01,631
[SPEAKER_08]: For now, it's free.

949
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:06,095
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I think it was actually supposed to contain quite a bit of stuff.

950
01:01:06,475 --> 01:01:13,721
[SPEAKER_08]: They were saying, I want to say it was like quite a few cars and about 16 tracks or something like that.

951
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:15,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was like 50 cars.

952
01:01:15,962 --> 01:01:17,784
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that would be pretty sweet if it was free.

953
01:01:18,865 --> 01:01:20,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I wouldn't have to buy the actual game.

954
01:01:21,207 --> 01:01:21,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha ha.

955
01:01:22,455 --> 01:01:25,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, let's see.

956
01:01:25,937 --> 01:01:30,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, there was one other thing.

957
01:01:30,499 --> 01:01:36,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say that they've partially cracked the Xbox 360 kernel.

958
01:01:36,962 --> 01:01:42,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that allows you to download or downgrade from any kernel without using a computer key.

959
01:01:43,705 --> 01:01:44,305
[SPEAKER_08]: It's possible.

960
01:01:44,365 --> 01:01:50,248
[SPEAKER_08]: So what that will allow you to do is drop your firmware, I guess, down to a level where you can...

961
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I have a choice

962
01:02:21,741 --> 01:02:24,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm glad you have such enthusiasm with this program.

963
01:02:25,183 --> 01:02:27,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll lift my ban on drinking for myself.

964
01:02:28,904 --> 01:02:30,385
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be fun.

965
01:02:31,286 --> 01:02:33,347
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we might have to do a drunk show after all.

966
01:02:34,047 --> 01:02:35,368
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

967
01:02:35,408 --> 01:02:36,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Migletov, your final thought.

968
01:02:38,149 --> 01:02:38,649
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

969
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:41,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your final thought.

970
01:02:42,831 --> 01:02:50,935
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is they had some people, I guess, at Leipzig that were just completely naked, except they were painted on.

971
01:02:51,704 --> 01:02:53,285
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we need to see at E3.

972
01:02:53,845 --> 01:02:54,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Painted chicks.

973
01:02:54,786 --> 01:02:55,566
[SPEAKER_08]: They're topless.

974
01:02:57,007 --> 01:03:01,249
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is Mike and Ike's are yummy and I just found one left in the bag.

975
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:02,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Delicious.

976
01:03:03,851 --> 01:03:04,871
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

977
01:03:04,991 --> 01:03:05,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Gross.

978
01:03:06,632 --> 01:03:07,533
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't like Mike and Ike's?

979
01:03:08,113 --> 01:03:11,295
[SPEAKER_11]: They're one of the candies I can't eat because I'm allergic to one of the ingredients.

980
01:03:12,315 --> 01:03:13,696
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the gelatin something something.

981
01:03:13,716 --> 01:03:17,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Same with Starburst and gum makes me nauseous when I smell it.

982
01:03:18,739 --> 01:03:20,560
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to figure out what the name of the ingredient would be.

983
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:25,710
[SPEAKER_10]: It's some... Jamie Repellent.

984
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:26,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, look, it's right in there.

985
01:03:26,871 --> 01:03:28,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Jamie Repellent number five.

986
01:03:28,151 --> 01:03:28,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knew?

987
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:29,872
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

988
01:03:30,492 --> 01:03:33,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, thanks, you guys, so much for tuning in to and downloading our show or tuning in live.

992
01:03:43,836 --> 01:03:44,897
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have to be your friends.

993
01:03:45,437 --> 01:03:49,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, because we'll take your enemies listening to the show, too, because we just like to get the word out.
