Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,520
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, August the 26th of 2007, where

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,620
we're taping Orange Lounge Radio live and this is the second half of our show, part

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,620
B.

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,760
We'll be right back into some gaming news from the one and only, Loki.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,760
Yes.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,120
Well, Metroid Prime 3 is coming out this week and one interesting thing on it is that they're

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,200
going to have kind of like a in-game sort of like achievements.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,800
They're going to have like a token feature that you unlock different things as you're

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,280
playing the game.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,800
And I don't know, I've seen this done in games before.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,000
It's not a huge deal, I mean it's not like achievements are coming to the Wii or anything

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
like that.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,240
In fact, they did something similar with Resistance where it had its kind of own achievement system

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,440
and I think there was even something like that sort of on Excite Truck a little bit

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
as well.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,920
So, I don't know, it's kind of neat.

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,840
Apparently the tokens that you can earn in the game are in four different tiers, red,

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,920
blue, green, and gold.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,720
Red tokens are gained by scanning enemies and items, blue for scanning lore and completing

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,120
side quests.

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,760
Green ones you get from friends.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,160
And gold is achieved from defeating bosses on various difficulties.

28
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,720
What is different from this and like the trophies that you earn in Burnout?

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,320
I think nothing.

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Nothing?

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,520
Absolutely nothing.

32
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,920
So what is so noteworthy about this?

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
I think people...

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,920
Is it the fact that it's the first time in a Metroid game?

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
I guess.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,120
People are thinking, oh my god, achievements are coming.

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
No.

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
No.

39
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,520
Alright, well one other thing that people would like to see coming to the Wii any day

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,560
now is online play and also demos for the Wii and there's actually a new survey that's

41
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,320
gone out from Nintendo that seems to indicate a little bit that there could be some actual

42
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,440
Wii demos coming out in the near future.

43
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,360
Nintendo actually submitted out this survey and on it are some different types of questions

44
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,240
on it and they seem to point towards the...

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,280
All signs, you could say, point to the fact that they're at least exploring the possibility

46
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,120
of doing downloadable demos.

47
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:35,320
Of course to date all we've really seen come from them would be the Metroid Prime 3 preview

48
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,640
channel.

49
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,360
Some of the things here, please indicate your level of interest in playable demo versions

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,460
of Wii games.

51
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,020
What is your preferred method of receiving Wii game demos?

52
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,480
Would you be willing to pay more for your subscription in order to receive Wii game

53
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
demos?

54
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,360
Kind of interesting there.

55
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,920
It would be kind of cool if Nintendo Power did have Wii game demos.

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,660
But what the other big three consoles do for their magazines.

57
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:05,000
But I would like to see the Wii actually able to download things other than virtual console

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,820
titles and a few crappy titles.

59
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,200
They're supposed to have original software, at least we know about that Mission Impossible

60
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
thing, right?

61
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,000
Well yeah, they're supposed to go online someday too.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,700
Come on, the console's been out for almost a year now.

63
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,400
Time to start following through with that shit you've been promising us for a while

64
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
now.

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Alright.

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,720
Or we're going to have to start calling you Sony.

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,200
Ooh, burn.

68
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Wow.

69
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,400
Well, how about some happy Nintendo news?

70
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,960
How does that sound?

71
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Sounds good to me.

72
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,980
Well, guess what is back for Super Mario Galaxy?

73
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,960
We have fire flowers!

74
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
And superstars!

75
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,020
I love the fire flowers so much because they're like burning things.

76
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,800
We're just happy that Mario can set fire to things again.

77
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,480
Well, you know, the fire flower was such a great weapon and then we just didn't get it.

78
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,000
We had him squirt shit with water.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Boo.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,840
What is so wrong with Mario Sunshine?

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,160
It wasn't that bad of a game.

82
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Jesus.

83
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,160
I loved Mario Sunshine.

84
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
What?

85
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
It is not the worst game ever.

86
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,760
But I could not play that game and drink anything.

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,540
It's the worst Mario game by far, it is so freaking terrible.

88
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,960
We need, we need another game that's just like Mario 64.

89
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,560
Did you play like Mario is Missing?

90
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,200
Mario is Missing is a great game, I have all those MP3s.

91
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,280
I liked it on Nintendo because they totally recreated the Super Nintendo graphics on the

92
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Nintendo.

93
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,720
Going to chat room for some comments at chat.orangelandrater.com.

94
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,800
RossdielUT says, Loki, stop wishing and relying on Nintendo's word.

95
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,400
Shadow Charlie says, Tanooki suit.

96
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
That would be a great thing to come back with.

97
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
No, no, no.

98
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Hammer Brother suit.

99
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
That would be pretty rad.

100
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Or the Kuriboh's boot.

101
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes, Kuriboh's shoe.

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's awesome.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, that was it.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,800
But in other news, we do have a release date for the UK on this.

105
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,680
It will be November 16th.

106
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,320
Oh right.

107
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,000
Not soon enough, right?

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Not soon enough.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Alrighty.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Anyways.

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,720
I do want to know who this new hoochie in the game is though, sorry.

112
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,880
Anyways, interesting news, and we knew this was kind of coming, but finally the Wii has

113
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,080
passed the Xbox 360 in worldwide sales.

114
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,560
Now the last screenshot that we've seen of this was of course a few days ago with the

115
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:29,720
Wii having approximately 10.57 million units worldwide and the Xbox 360 having 10.51 million

116
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
units.

117
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,080
Of course the PS3 still trailing behind with 4.32 million units.

118
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:44,060
It should be known though that still the 360 is outselling the Wii in the US, but apparently

119
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,680
Japan is where they're making up for a lot of slack.

120
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,260
So what does this mean for Nintendo fanboys?

121
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,020
Is this something additional for them to brag about or is this really not the big deal it

122
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,280
seems like?

123
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,720
I guess it's fuel for flame fodder I guess because the Wii has basically caught up to

124
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,680
the 360 in half the time.

125
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,780
So I don't know, I mean that's really good and I think if they could produce more units

126
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,320
it would be even higher, but hopefully that means more support.

127
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Better games!

128
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,520
Alright well some other bad news for the Xbox 360.

129
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,980
Mass Effect is a title that a lot of people have been looking forward to and Mass Effect

130
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,600
has been delayed to December 7th of this year.

131
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,840
Now it wasn't a huge push from where it was originally scheduled, but you know people

132
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,820
are chomping at the bit to get their hands on this game and so any delay I'm sure is

133
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,240
bad news for its fans.

134
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,280
Plus that means it's not going to be on shelves for the day after Thanksgiving madness so

135
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,120
that's kind of too bad, but I'm sure those people that have been very good boys and girls

136
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,760
this year that put this on their Christmas list, I'm sure Santa will find a way, right?

137
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
Sure.

138
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,840
Of course then again if you believe in Santa you probably should not be playing Mass Effect.

139
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Come to think of it.

140
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,600
Why does Santa die in it?

141
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,960
I don't know, possibly.

142
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:12,400
Well for anyone who is at Penny Arcade Expo they did confirm that Penny Arcade Adventures

143
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,920
on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade in 2008.

144
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,420
It was also announced for PC, Mac OS X, and Linux.

145
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,600
So hey, game!

146
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Cool.

147
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,160
That's kind of interesting.

148
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,320
Is that the console you guys would have guessed that this was going to be released on?

149
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Yep.

150
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,880
I sort of thought so too.

151
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,900
Just because you know there's the, for a long time now there's been the little picture icons

152
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,800
and themes and all that stuff that you can download on Xbox Live so why not this?

153
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,400
Why not now their game on Xbox Live?

154
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Why not?

155
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
If there's more money to be done, why not?

156
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,000
Well Penny Arcade Adventures isn't the only thing coming to Xbox Live soon.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,920
There is a rumor of course with the fall update due out in November that it's possibly going

158
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,240
to include Xvid support.

159
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:11,640
Now some other plans from this leaked list, supposedly a new Xbox Live Arcade Blade, IPTV

160
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,600
support, integrated clan functionality, a picture in picture setting, and improved slideshow

161
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
effects.

162
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,500
That would be pretty awesome if it had Xvid codec support.

163
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,120
What exactly is Xvid?

164
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,380
It's kind of like Divx.

165
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:33,880
It's a video codec for encoding MPEG4 video so that you can rip a DVD and have it be a

166
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,920
decent file size.

167
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
It's pretty popular.

168
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,920
But you would still have to stream it.

169
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Yeah.

170
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,240
Well I'm saying you still have to have it in WMV format, right?

171
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,040
I don't know about that.

172
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,320
I would imagine you would, but who knows?

173
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Interesting.

174
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,360
Well, something that is definitive, I mean that's a rumor, but something definitive,

175
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,960
although it's been rumored about for quite some time, is that Microsoft is taking a pass

176
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,000
on going to E for All.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,280
I know a lot of people were very hopeful that Microsoft was going to be attending the show.

178
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
I mean why not?

179
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,320
Nintendo's going to the show, but apparently Microsoft has just decided there's better

180
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
things to do.

181
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,700
They're not going to the show.

182
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,740
By the way, Sony is also not going to E for All.

183
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,600
There's also some other companies that have said they're not going, including Capcom and

184
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
so on.

185
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,960
Some of the companies that are going, though, would be Nintendo and Konami.

186
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,960
So it's not like it's going to be an empty show, but it is going to be a little bit of

187
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,800
a bummer that you don't have two of the big three showing up at E for All.

188
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,280
I don't know about you guys, but the fact that I'm actually kind of planning on going

189
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,160
to E for All because I got an invite and everything and I was planning the trip to go to L.A.,

190
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,360
I'm a little bit irritated that some of these companies are dropping out of E for All.

191
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,440
That news makes me a little bit angsty.

192
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,920
And when we get angsty, people die.

193
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, and the FUs of the week come out.

194
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,640
Oh, Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off with tonight's FUs?

195
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:10,000
Um, FU to my broken head, really, it still hurts.

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,560
You know, it happened, what, four hours ago?

197
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,560
But it's not four, why does it say four?

198
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Three hours, two hours, whatever ago, and it still hurts.

199
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,600
And a secondary FU goes toward the art block, because I've been trying to draw and it's

200
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,880
just not working.

201
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,920
So instead of writer's block, it's art block?

202
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
It's art block.

203
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,920
Oh, I've been having a bit of writer's block, too, just in different capacities.

204
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,520
So FU to blocks of all shapes and sizes?

205
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,920
To the block of creativity, there we go.

206
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
All right, Loki, your FUs of the week.

207
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,760
My FUs of the week go to my cat for constantly waking me up in the middle of the night.

208
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,120
It's almost like having a goddamn baby, so.

209
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,560
Fuck you to the cat.

210
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,520
Just imagine when you really have a baby, imagine babies in your house.

211
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,480
Yeah, that's very funny.

212
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,120
I don't really have a lot to say FU to this week, I've actually had a pretty good week,

213
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,640
so FU to people who don't like caramel, because caramel ice cream is awesome.

214
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,600
But then again, maybe I shouldn't say FU to that, because that just means more for me,

215
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
right?

216
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
I don't know.

217
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,440
Miggletob, do you have any FUs of the week, while you're staring off into space over there?

218
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:26,240
FU to you for thinking about getting popsicles, because they are the worst.

219
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Popsicles are awesome.

220
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,920
Here's the thing though, Miggletob, it wasn't that I was going to buy popsicles, I was going

221
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,160
to buy creamsicles, and those are awesome.

222
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,280
All right, let's end this segment now, shall we?

223
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,320
Are either of you guys, is anybody else in here thinking of going to E for All?

224
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
I was.

225
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,120
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to go though.

226
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,320
It doesn't excite me as much anymore.

227
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,440
I would like to go.

228
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,440
I'd rather go to PAX, but that's kind of late for that.

229
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,760
It's a little bit over now.

230
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,740
What's in it for you to see at E for All?

231
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,320
I like Nintendo and Konami, and that's really all I remember that are actually going.

232
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,080
But not having E3 to go to this year, and going to Comic Con made me realize that I

233
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,240
kind of miss stuff like that, so going to E for All would be pretty cool.

234
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,640
Let's get back to some gaming news, now that the FUs of the week are over.

235
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Well, you know, it was bound to happen.

236
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:27,240
For our buddies overseas, the Xbox 360 is getting a price drop in Europe, occurring

237
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,440
on the 24th of August.

238
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,000
It will be decreasing by 20 pounds on the core unit, and 30 on the 20 gigabyte 360,

239
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:48,400
it'll bring the price down respectively to $249.99, and I'm sorry, that's on the 20 gig,

240
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,300
and $179.99 on the core.

241
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,440
That's again in British pounds.

242
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,800
Also, the Elite will retail for $299.99.

243
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:07,160
All right, well, I just got to say real quickly for the live folks, it looks like our stream

244
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,760
is down, and I'm blaming Operator 11 for that, so at this time I'm going to shut this off

245
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,760
until we can work on this some other time, because it's probably taking a lot of bandwidth,

246
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,340
so we're going to have to get rid of this to get our stream back, so that's the end

247
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,880
of the Op 11 simulcast for now, until we can work on that a little later.

248
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Sorry, guys.

249
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,080
All right, but in the meantime, we will go back to...

250
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,640
There was more news on that.

251
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

252
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,380
The Shizzle Games of Belgium was advertising by price from Elite down to Core, and Euros

253
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:47,120
as $449.99, $349.99, and $279.99 on their SKUs, and that's it.

254
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
Actually, no, my apologies.

255
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,640
Their Core was being called the Arcade, and then they have the Pro.

256
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,480
Very bizarre, but anyway.

257
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,280
That is kind of bizarre.

258
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,640
It's even more bizarre that they're called Shizzle Games.

259
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,120
Shizzle Games.

260
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:11,520
Well, the rumor, of course, of that new arcade SKU for the Core system is actually supposed

261
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:19,980
to be coming to the US as well, and same details, no definite launch date or anything like that,

262
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:26,500
but it is allegedly supposed to come out over here as well.

263
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
That's a good idea.

264
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,200
Hey, the Core system's not bad, but I know a lot of people complain that they can't save

265
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:40,240
their game, so now that that's going to be coming with a memory unit, that might be something

266
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,720
to actually look into if you're not into the whole live downloading thing.

267
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,920
Well, speaking of systems coming out in new shapes and sizes and all different types of

268
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,740
colors, the PSP Slim is going to be coming out in a variety of different colors over

269
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,200
there in Europe.

270
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,660
On September 5th, Simpsons Yellow and Spider-Man Black and Red will be some new designs that

271
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,400
are coming out for the PSP Slim over there in Europe, where, of course, when you talk

272
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,400
about colors, that's C-O-L-O-U-R-S, ha ha ha.

273
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Just kidding.

274
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
By the way...

275
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,560
I bet you can't spell maneuver.

276
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,480
As a reminder, over here stateside, you get some Star Wars themed colors, but you don't

277
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,960
get the Simpsons or Spider-Man ones.

278
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,280
So there you have it.

279
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,880
Alright, well, moving on, Dark Soccer likes to surf the internet up and down and all around

280
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,620
every single week, and she likes to find a website that works for all of you, and it's

281
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,600
her website of the week that she's going to share with you guys right now.

282
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:48,240
Website of the week is actually suggested to me by Loki, and it's actually pretty cool.

283
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,880
It's Cult of Rapture.

284
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:58,960
If you go to 2KGames.com slash Cult of Rapture, all one word, it will take you to a Bioshock

285
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,280
page for the fans, I guess.

286
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:09,880
Talking about the music that's out, has downloads, articles, a forum, goodies for everybody.

287
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
It's pretty cool.

288
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
It's very pretty.

289
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,200
Yeah, it's actually very, very pretty.

290
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,840
But I do believe that you have to be over 18 to the page, so go see it, I'll be posting

291
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,640
the address into the chat room presently.

292
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Very cool.

293
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Alrighty.

294
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Awesome.

295
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:37,000
Something else that's pretty awesome, fans of Geometry Wars will be quite happy, because

296
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,640
with Project Gotham Racing 4, they'll be getting a brand new Geometry Wars game.

297
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:50,440
And no info, though, on, it's supposed to be not too different than Retro Evolved, but

298
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,400
it is going to be a little bit different, it's called Geometry War Waves.

299
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,160
No real details, though, on what exactly is different, but apparently not that much.

300
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Well, I don't know what's going to change in the great amount of time it's going to

301
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,560
take for this game to come out, because Spore is apparently finished.

302
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,600
The game is not totally finished and ready to go, but apparently the game is complete.

303
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,800
This is coming from reports of people who have had a hands-on with Spore at Leipzig.

304
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,160
EA is simply going to be spending the next few months listening to feedback from players,

305
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,320
assuming the QA testers and beta testers, to tweak and polish Spore for its final release,

306
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,200
which is still set for next spring.

307
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,560
So certainly you can look around the internet on some different blogs there and find some

308
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,240
hands-on reports from Spore, which is definitely a game I am certainly looking forward to.

309
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,080
So GS68 in our chat room says, Spore forever?

310
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
I don't think so.

311
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,840
I don't think you can make those jokes anymore, because it does look like this game is actually

312
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
going to come out.

313
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
Hooray!

314
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
So, we'll see.

315
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
All right.

316
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,880
Anyway, it's time for an old favorite segment of ours here on Orange Lounge Radio.

317
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,160
It's a segment we like to call Listless.

318
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:03,960
All right.

319
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,240
The way Listless works is that we create a list here.

320
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,440
We're trying to define the definitive top three of a certain category, and tonight's

321
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,600
category is character we would most like to see in the upcoming track and field DS game.

322
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,280
Now, the character does not have to be a Konami character, but it helps.

323
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Okay?

324
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
So, here's the deal.

325
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
Here's how it works.

326
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,800
We're going to go around, and myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and Miklotov will all give their

327
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
top three.

328
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,480
So that's going to leave us with a list of 12.

329
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,160
Then we will all go around the room and take one unworthy candidate off the list, leaving

330
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,120
a list of eight.

331
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,480
And we will post that list of eight to the chat room, and you'll vote for your number

332
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
one and your number two picks.

333
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,980
We'll tally them up, and the winning votes will be revealed a little later in the show.

334
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,560
That's how Listless works.

335
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,200
So who's going to start us off tonight?

336
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Loki, you ready to go?

337
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Sure.

338
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
All right.

339
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,120
What's your number three pick for character you would most like to see in track and field?

340
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,600
I guess it'd be a little weird, but I would like to see... Actually, this is kind of

341
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,040
a baby lawn from DDR 5th Mix.

342
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,280
Ah, baby lawn from DDR 5th Mix.

343
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Why?

344
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Just so you can run us a baby or what?

345
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,600
Because it's a baby running.

346
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
It's funny.

347
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
I don't know.

348
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,160
All right.

349
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Baby lawn, says Loki.

350
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,600
Miklotov, do you have a number three pick?

351
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,760
I'll take Robbie the rabbit from Silent Hill, because what's cuter than a bunny with blood

352
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,200
on its mouth running around throwing stuff like javelins and things?

353
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,520
We're already picking just Konami.

354
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
Dude, you don't have to pick Konami.

355
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:47,400
I said it doesn't have to be Konami, but it helps, because the real game... Yeah, it

356
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
could be Nintendo, because it's DS51.

357
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Let's leave it to Konami and Nintendo.

358
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Oh, God.

359
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I have to rethink my list.

360
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
All right.

361
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,160
I'll come up with some ideas.

362
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,480
Dark Soccer, your number three pick.

363
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,400
Aitsu or Koitsu from Parodius.

364
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,320
They're the little stickmen riding paper airplanes.

365
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,320
How the crap do you spell that?

366
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,440
A-I-T-S-U and then K-O-I-T-S-U.

367
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
From Parodius.

368
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
Yes.

369
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,400
All right.

370
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,840
My number three pick would also come from DDR, and that would be Alice, the little raving

371
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,160
character, because I think it would be funny for her to do a bunch of ecstasy and then

372
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,160
compete in Olympic events.

373
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,440
Her heart might explode right there on the track.

374
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,800
So I pick Alice, the raver girl from DDR Fifth Mix, plus a lot of the boys think Alice is

375
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,920
hot, so I'm sure you'll enjoy that, and some of the girls.

376
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,560
Loki, your number two pick.

377
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,400
This is also kind of tying in with Konami stuff, but I'm not sure what you would really

378
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,680
call it.

379
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:55,000
The dog from Silent Hill 2, from the dog ending, the Shiba Inu.

380
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's fantastic.

381
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,320
I love the dog.

382
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,920
So the dog from the dog ending of Silent Hill 2.

383
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
Good pick.

384
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,960
Mikol Tov, your number two pick.

385
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:12,960
I'm going to say Evil Rose, from Rumble Roses, because what little boy doesn't want to watch

386
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,800
the girls with the big breasts run around on the track, except for sane ones.

387
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
All right.

388
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,440
So one of the big titty girls from Rumble Roses will hopefully appear on track and field.

389
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
She can't run.

390
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
All right.

391
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
Dark Sakura, your number two pick.

392
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,560
My number two pick is going to be Pit.

393
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,200
Pit, from now a Nintendo character.

394
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Okay, fair enough.

395
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,240
If he says we're Nintendo, I said Pit.

396
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
All right.

397
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Pit from Kid Icarus.

398
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Why not?

399
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,240
That would be fun.

400
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
Except he can fly.

401
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
Couldn't that be cheating?

402
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
So can Aizu and Koizu.

403
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
All right.

404
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Moving on.

405
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,040
Number two pick for me.

406
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,720
My number two pick I would like to see in the game would be Dracula, from the Castlevania

407
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
games.

408
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
You know, why not?

409
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,760
And then somebody can come out and say...

410
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
Not by my hand.

411
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,800
I was once again given a gold medal.

412
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Die, monster.

413
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
You don't belong in this world.

414
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,120
Except that was the other guy that said that.

415
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,000
But I still think it would be cool if Dracula was in the game.

416
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,280
So Dracula is my number two pick.

417
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,640
Number one pick, Sloki.

418
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
Oh, man.

419
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,960
Oh, let's see.

420
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,400
Number one pick, I will say, well, that doesn't really count because that's Hudson.

421
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,560
Well, no, that could work because Konami has license over Hudson games now, right?

422
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
Yeah.

423
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
You can do Hudson.

424
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,680
I don't know if this would be my number one pick, but Bomberman.

425
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:37,360
Okay, because maybe Bomberman could just leave bombs on the track, yes?

426
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
Sure.

427
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
That'll work.

428
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Yeah, sure.

429
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
Right.

430
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
Whatever you say, Rob.

431
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
All right.

432
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,080
Miklotov, what would be your number one pick?

433
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:52,560
The left DDR arrow, because I think that would be pretty awesome.

434
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,560
So you just want to be the DDR arrow in the game.

435
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Oops.

436
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,400
I totally didn't spell arrow right there.

437
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Let's try that again.

438
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
There we go.

439
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Much better.

440
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,560
So just the floating arrow would be a character with legs.

441
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,960
Maybe not with legs, but a sweatband.

442
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
You are weird.

443
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,000
All right.

444
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,320
Dark Sakura, your number one pick.

445
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,760
My number one pick is the mascot from Guitar Freak.

446
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,840
You need to lift the bag over his head.

447
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,840
I don't remember his name.

448
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,280
I just put Guitar Freak bag over head guy.

449
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Okay.

450
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
Why is that?

451
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
What?

452
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
Oh, I had an excellent idea for one, but...

453
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
It's too late now.

454
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Yeah, it's too late.

455
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
All right.

456
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
We'll see.

457
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
Okay.

458
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,020
My number one pick.

459
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,580
My number one pick did not get a lot of coverage in a lot of the various Konami games that

460
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,640
existed out there.

461
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:49,560
In fact, my number one pick was really obscure, because he was only in one game that Konami

462
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,120
ever put out, and it was on the PC.

463
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
But I'll tell you what.

464
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,680
If you've been listening to this show for some amount of time, then you know the love

465
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,440
that the people of this program have for Mr. Spanky from DDR PC.

466
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,900
And that is my number one pick, would be Mr. Spanky, the guy that's dressed up like a dominatrix

467
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,040
character from DDR PC.

468
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,360
Because then the game would be rated M, and no one would get to play it.

469
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,160
So that actually doesn't turn out to be such a good idea.

470
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,120
But hey, this is supposed to be a fantasy.

471
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,160
My runner up would be the Konami code.

472
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Just have the...

473
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,760
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

474
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,000
Have the Konami code in it.

475
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
No, no, no.

476
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,360
Oh, I should have said the little ship from Parodius, because then you can have the sound

477
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,000
blaster, or Twinbee.

478
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,720
You know what also amazes me about this list?

479
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,440
Is that not a single damn Metal Gear character on the whole list.

480
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,540
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

481
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
That about Tastra.

482
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,360
Change Baghead Guy to Twinbee.

483
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,360
Twinbee?

484
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,360
Twinbee.

485
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
All right.

486
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
I'm going to try it better.

487
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
All right.

488
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
All right.

489
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
Well, she changed it then.

490
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
Twinbee.

491
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
Let's see.

492
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,280
SSJ100 Matt voted for the goalie from Blade of Steel.

493
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
That's pretty awesome.

494
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,280
All right.

495
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Here's the list of stands right now.

496
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,440
But remember, we're going around and eliminating off the list here.

497
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,700
Baby Lawn, Robby the Rabbit, Aitsu Koitsu, Alice, the dog from the dog inning of Silent

498
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:14,800
Hill 2, Evil Rose, Pit, Dracula, Bomberman, the left DDR arrow, Twinbee, and Mr. Spanky.

499
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Why left and not right?

500
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Just out of curiosity.

501
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,400
Because it's just the first one I thought of.

502
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
All right.

503
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,860
Loki, one of these is not worthy of being on the list.

504
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:29,360
What is not worthy of being on the list?

505
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,800
I'm just going to say Aitsu Koitsu because I have no idea what the hell that is.

506
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Very obscure.

507
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,200
Yeah, that was a little too obscure for my taste.

508
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
They're awesome.

509
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
All right.

510
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,880
Miklotov, one of these is not worthy of being on the list.

511
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,720
What is not worthy of being on the list?

512
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,000
Just because it really looks out of place on that list, I'm going to throw out Pit even

513
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,240
though I love Kid Icarus a whole lot and yeah, I'm sorry.

514
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
All right.

515
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,020
Dark Sakura, what is not worthy of the list?

516
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:09,200
I'm going to vote for Alice.

517
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Alice is not worthy of being on the list and raver kids everywhere are crying.

518
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
What does that mean, Miklotov?

519
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Have you seen Alice from Supernova 2 yet?

520
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,200
She's all dressed up like an idiot and weirdo.

521
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,200
All right.

522
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Well, whatever.

523
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
Let's see.

524
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,600
The one I deem worthy of not being on the list is... Oh, this is hard.

525
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,520
I'm also going to take out a DDR character and say Baby Lawn is not worthy of being on

526
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
the list.

527
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,980
So there you go.

528
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,800
That leaves our list as... There's a little nudity in that card.

529
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,760
All right, that leaves our list as Robbie the Rabbit, the dog from the dog-ending of

530
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:50,080
Silent Hill 2, Evil Rose, Dracula, Bomberman, the left DDR arrow, Twinbee, and Mr. Spanky.

531
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
All right.

532
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,080
So I'm going to post that there in the chat room and if you would, send a private message

533
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,000
to Rob Roberts, not Sky tonight because I don't have my normal name.

534
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,280
Send a private message with your number one and number two pick.

535
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,920
It is important what you designate as one and two.

536
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,800
If you do not designate, I will assume your first pick is your number one.

537
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,600
So there you have it.

538
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,920
Did you find anything else that you thought should have been on the list, Loki, because

539
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,400
I saw you searching Wikipedia frantically?

540
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,080
I was trying to think whatever... I don't remember what the boss was called in Contra,

541
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
like the giant heart.

542
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,000
I was thinking the giant alien head thing would have been pretty awesome.

543
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,640
What about the vomiting baby turtle thing or whatever that was from like...

544
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:36,040
Aw, we should have more time to prepare, a vomiting baby turtle would have been awesome.

545
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,720
An unsold copy of, what was it, Bomberman Act Zero.

546
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,280
I was actually thinking, because you know, I was thinking really obscure.

547
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,440
You know, if we were going Sega, I'd totally say the Oppa Oppa.

548
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
But we didn't go Sega.

549
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,440
No, we didn't.

550
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
We sure didn't.

551
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
Because the Oppa Oppa would kill everybody.

552
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Right.

553
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,480
Because the Oppa Oppa's awesome.

554
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,240
We will announce the winners a wee bit later, but for now we've got to get back into some

555
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,800
news and then the Skype line, your calls at Orange Lounge Radio username on Skype or our

556
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,480
800 number 1877 game OLR.

557
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,200
We'll get to those very shortly, but first a little more news.

558
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Loki.

559
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:19,360
Yes, and apparently people were not too happy with BioShock's way they've handled widescreen,

560
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,260
and apparently there are some fixes though if you want to correct that.

561
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:31,960
There is a hack that you can download for the PC version and it will allow you to, not

562
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,720
necessarily resize your screen, but resize the view on there.

563
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,080
And you can do all sorts of fun things, including different resolution sizes like 16.9, true

564
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
16.9.

565
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,240
Because apparently the way this game worked before is they would just kind of do like

566
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,480
a reverse pan and scan on it.

567
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,160
They would cut the top and bottom off on the widescreen.

568
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:01,200
But apparently there's also, I guess there's going to be a fix coming for Xbox 360 over

569
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,640
live at some point as well, at least that's a rumor.

570
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,720
So if that's really bothering you, you can go ahead and download the patch, which is

571
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:23,360
available it looks like on dl.tocaedit.com slash BioShockDFOV.zip.

572
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,000
Loki out of curiosity, what do you think about that whole fallout about how people were really

573
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,960
pissed about all the issues the PC was having, not just the widescreen stuff, but the fact

574
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,520
that you could only install so many copies on one machine and kind of like how quick

575
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,360
they've been to respond to that.

576
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,780
The whole widescreen thing was stupid, I think, because I mean personally I don't think anyone

577
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,440
noticed it during the demo until someone mentioned, oh hey, by the way, this is like that.

578
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,720
They're all, oh my God, that's horrible.

579
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,480
I mean it doesn't just detract anything from the game, so big deal.

580
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,360
I mean you can fix it on the PC now, so I don't know, it's not a big deal.

581
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
The cop protection thing kind of sucks.

582
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,120
I know a lot of people are like installing on multiple computers, which I guess technically

583
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,480
violates some sort of rights or something, I don't know, but there's a fix coming for

584
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:18,160
that as well, so I don't think that's a big worry, but yeah, little bitty things.

585
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:23,200
All right, SSJ100Matt says, though Pan and Scan ruins movies.

586
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
It does.

587
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,880
It absolutely does.

588
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
I agree, actually.

589
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,760
All right, let's open up our Skype line and hear from you guys.

590
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,360
If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is now open.

591
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,640
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, or you can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR

592
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,960
is the number to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

593
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,120
And while we're waiting for those to come in, I'll just say that this is your last chance

594
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,600
to submit your votes for listless.

595
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:55,040
I think most people in our chat room already voted, but just in case, there's a couple

596
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,960
stragglers, we'll take those.

597
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,000
Let's go to the phones.

598
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

599
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
This is Ravenstaufen.

600
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Well, hello.

601
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
The guy, that guy.

602
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,780
Damn, you get through first every time.

603
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
How is that?

604
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,780
All right, well, what's on your mind, Ravenstaufen?

605
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,400
I have a fast finger and a new keyboard.

606
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,520
I'll leave the fast finger comment as is.

607
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
Well, what's on your mind?

608
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,720
Lame mean finger.

609
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,260
My comment tonight is you mentioned that Nintendo surpassed the 360?

610
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,400
In terms of worldwide sales, yes.

611
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:33,080
Well, you know, I know this is going to turn into a flame world real fast and real quick,

612
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,520
so I'll try to keep the flames to a minimum.

613
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,960
But you know, I believe that people that buy in the Wii is not us hardcore gamers.

614
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,640
Like we bought it, I bought it, you bought it, Loki bought it, Dark Soccer bought it,

615
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,760
but those soccer moms of the world.

616
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,200
No, I totally agree with you, but the sale is a sale, right?

617
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Sales is a sale.

618
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Money is money, right?

619
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,800
The bottom line is a dollar.

620
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:59,480
However, I will say this, what I would be curious to see is how many games per system

621
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
is out there.

622
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
You know what I mean?

623
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,880
Like a 360 owner probably has a lot of games at this point, whereas a Wii owner maybe doesn't

624
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,000
have so many games.

625
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,320
But I don't know, that may not be true because then again, you look at the games that are

626
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,720
out on the Wii, there's not a lot for hardcore gamers.

627
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,720
I mean, there's some.

628
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,580
You know, you're Super Paper Mario, you're Metroid, but there is a lot of crap out there

629
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,580
on the Wii.

630
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
Like Boogie?

631
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,800
Your Happy Feets, well, I haven't played Boogie, but I don't know.

632
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,820
But that commercial really wants me, I'm memorized about that commercial of Boogie.

633
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,440
It almost wants me to buy it, but my mind goes like, don't buy it, it's junk.

634
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,560
Don't buy it, don't fall for it.

635
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,040
I've never seen the commercial, but I don't watch TV.

636
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,480
What's it like?

637
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,120
It's they're doing a disco one, and they're like doing the Wii mode.

638
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,080
It has nothing to do with the game, no gameplay footage whatsoever.

639
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,120
But the commercials, I think it was great.

640
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,240
You know, I'm like, wow, that looks like fun, and then I smack myself going like, shit,

641
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,500
it's not fun.

642
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,360
But they do show you how to actually play the game in the commercial, because they do

643
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,000
have the Wii mode and the nunchuck moving back and forth, and what I assume is how you're

644
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,120
supposed to play that piece of crap game.

645
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,720
And then I smack myself, and then I set free.

646
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,520
Yeah, renting might be a thing to do.

647
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,960
Ross Steel UT says, problem is that most people are just buying it as a Wii sports machine,

648
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,760
and will never buy anything for it.

649
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,280
Well, what about Wii Play, though, because Wii Play's been selling a lot.

650
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,040
And how come the PlayStation 2's still selling?

651
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,000
Gold Banjo, I think same reason, actually.

652
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,600
Gold Banjo says, my little sister sings along during that commercial.

653
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,320
I think the PlayStation 2 continues to sell, because they're A, cheap, and B, there's a

654
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,400
shitload of games for it.

655
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,160
I mean, just massive and massive amounts of games for it.

656
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
So.

657
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
All right.

658
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
One more thing.

659
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,520
Of course, one more thing, sir.

660
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,560
You know, the new release of Bioshock came out, and I was just wondering, do you think

661
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,600
this game's going to be buried like Dead Rising when it came out in the first?

662
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,000
Dead Rising's one of those games that everyone loved, played, you know, Loki loved it, I

663
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
loved it.

664
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,120
Is Bioshock going to fall under that, like, we love it, and we leave it for, like, another

665
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,120
game?

666
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,640
I'm going to take a very controversial stance here, and I'm going to say yes.

667
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,320
It will fall off the radar because of lack of multiplayer, because I think people are

668
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,920
going to go, like, just kill through the game in the single player mode, and then, you know,

669
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,840
while there will be a few that will replay it, and the faithful that will show it to

670
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,920
their friends and replay it, I think when Halo 3 comes out, a lot of people are going

671
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,560
to go over there, and Halo 3 is going to have the lasting multiplayer.

672
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,520
So I, you know, and I realized, you know, I could be wrong, but I think the lack of

673
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,520
multiplayer, also very similar to Dead Rising, I think the lack of multiplayer is really

674
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,600
going to hurt the game.

675
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:39,640
But at the same time, I think Bioshock will trump Halo 3 on some end-of-year best lists.

676
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,200
So I think you may see a small resurgence come the end of the year during award times.

677
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah, I'm just saying that because, you know, this game has, you know, everyone loved it.

678
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
You know, it's like, you know, what's that game I'm trying to think of?

679
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Floss Planet.

680
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,080
You know, everyone played it at, like, for two weeks, and then the next game came out

681
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,000
with Graw, and then everyone went, oh, what's this, and then dropped it like a lead balloon.

682
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,760
Well, that's a lot of the Xbox Live Arcade releases, too.

683
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,680
I mean, how many people on your friends list do you see playing Street Fighter II anymore?

684
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,520
How many people are still playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night?

685
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
Doom.

686
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
Doom.

687
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,960
My hand is raised because we were playing it recently.

688
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,600
Well, okay, so one person on the entire internet is playing it.

689
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
No, I'm just kidding.

690
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,800
I'm not a supporting person on the internet.

691
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,080
But if I look at my friends list, I do not see people playing a lot of the old arcade

692
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,160
releases except for a few big, big biggies, like Geometry Wars.

693
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,280
Pac-Man Championship Edition still comes up.

694
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,480
So a couple of those.

695
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
That is it.

696
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
Thank you for taking my call.

697
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
You're welcome.

698
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,480
One more comment here really quickly.

699
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,400
DJ Kibbles and Bits in chat says, the thing is, a lot of people stopped playing Dead Rising

700
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,240
because of that damn save system.

701
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,960
Yeah, that was definitely one of my, why I stopped playing.

702
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,200
After a while, it just got too annoying to keep replaying it over and over again.

703
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,360
Yeah, they screwed up that save system.

704
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,640
You had to go pee or take a poop or sleep.

705
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,080
That was dumb.

706
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,960
Rasteel UT says lots of people play games and don't go on live.

707
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,360
That's true, but I'm using the rationalization that you have to go on live to get the game

708
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:12,200
in the first place, unless it was on that arcade unplugged disc, but I truly think that's

709
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,440
in the minority.

710
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
One more comment.

711
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
Yes.

712
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,320
You would think that a mall that's so big would have more bathrooms.

713
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
No.

714
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
All right.

715
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,920
Ravenstaufen, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, buddy, okay?

716
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
You too, bye.

717
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
All right.

718
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:32,520
Again, if you want to give us a call, our number 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on

719
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:38,240
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and there's lots of calls coming in, but unfortunately Skype

720
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,080
is only allowing me to take one call at a time.

721
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:47,040
Oh my gosh, this is a mess.

722
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,280
All right, I'm going to have to... Hold on guys, we're going to change the options here

723
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,720
in Skype so that only fricking one call can come through at a time.

724
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,720
This is annoying.

725
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,680
Loki, do you have any last minute stories while I change this real quick here?

726
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,680
Yes I do.

727
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,680
Thank you.

728
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
Give us one real quick.

729
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,260
Okay, real quick, there's some interesting things coming out about the brand new Brain

730
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:15,400
Age 2 DS, the one that, you know, red and black, whatever.

731
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,760
Apparently the LCD screen's a little bit dimmer than the normal DS Lite.

732
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,800
Uh oh, that sucks for people that bought it.

733
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,240
Let's see, enter interesting things.

734
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:36,600
There was a PSP petition for Resident Evil coming onto the PSP, it got the attention

735
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:46,400
of Capcom, who says if you get over 10,000 signatures that will draw significant attention,

736
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,120
and now they're up to 17,000 signatures, so maybe we'll see a PSP version of Resident

737
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Evil.

738
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,400
Hold on, I fixed Skype, so save the rest for a little later, all righty?

739
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Okay.

740
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Can you do that?

741
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,400
All right.

742
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

743
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Who's this?

744
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
GS68.

745
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
What's on your mind, GS68?

746
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:12,880
Well, I noticed that all of the games on the Virtual Console are, well, console games.

747
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,840
I haven't heard anything about Game Boy games being on the Virtual Console or Game Boy Color

748
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
games.

749
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,640
That's an interesting thought.

750
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,960
We don't hear, I mean we always hear about all these systems coming to the Virtual Console

751
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,840
and now we even talk about CDs, but yet we never have the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance

752
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,400
even or Game Boy Color ever talked about.

753
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Why is that, you guys?

754
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,200
Do you think there's a reason why Nintendo doesn't put these games out on Wii Virtual

755
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,560
Console?

756
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,680
Because you really don't need to play a black and white version of Mario Brothers.

757
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,680
On the big screen TV?

758
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,320
Yeah, it just wouldn't look good.

759
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,720
I would actually like to see them port crappy Metroid 2 from Game Boy onto the Virtual Console

760
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,800
because that game was a pain to play on the original Game Boy.

761
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,760
I think actually playing it on TV would make it a worthwhile experience.

762
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,840
Or how about they do a Metroid All-Stars where they just redesign the game and upgrade the

763
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
graphics?

764
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,840
Yeah, that would be good too.

765
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,240
Oh, and Kid Icarus on Game Boy, even though I'm not sure if it's a good game at all, but

766
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,600
I would still like to play that too.

767
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,080
There's a lot of games back then that I missed out on because I was too little and now I

768
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:22,640
want to play them, but they're impossible to find unless I emulate them.

769
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,200
GS68, what are your thoughts on that?

770
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:31,760
Well, I don't really know a lot of good Game Boy games.

771
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,960
Like there are the games that I grew up with and that's about it.

772
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,120
Holy crap, I can hear myself.

773
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,560
What got you thinking about this?

774
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,300
I don't know, just randomly I guess.

775
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,400
That's all good.

776
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,600
You know what would actually be really cool though would be, even though the DS doesn't

777
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:53,200
play the old Game Boy games, it would be kind of cool if there was that functionality between

778
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,440
the DS and the Wii a little later on, which we all know there is some functionality there,

779
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,720
where maybe you could download a virtual console game from the Game Boy and play it on your

780
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,720
DS.

781
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,280
Wouldn't that be kind of neat?

782
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,680
But I haven't heard any news about the DS Wii connectivity yet.

783
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,560
The only thing I've really heard is Pokemon Battle Revolution, which isn't a whole lot.

784
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
Oh yeah.

785
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,560
That's really it.

786
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,280
Well, GSXC, that was a good thought.

787
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,200
Anything else you want to comment on tonight?

788
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,960
If Mr. Spanky wins the list list, I'll make videos of myself killing patients in trauma

789
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
center.

790
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,200
Alright, so if Mr. Spanky wins list list, you're going to kill patients in trauma centers

791
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
and put it on the YouTubes.

792
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,400
Well, we're going to find out very soon what won.

793
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,480
Just out of curiosity, can you describe your hatred of Mr. Spanky to the listeners who

794
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
may not be familiar with the character?

795
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:49,480
Well, I heard him on, well, I heard his voice on many episodes ago, and, well, I didn't

796
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,480
really like it.

797
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,520
I'm sorry to hear that, although you know that wasn't the official voice, right?

798
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,840
That was just some idiot pretending, right?

799
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Yeah.

800
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,480
I am noticing there is no article on Mr. Spanky on Wikipedia.

801
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,360
I was hoping for some pictures or something, like an article I could refer people to, but

802
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,360
there's nothing.

803
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,480
Did you spell it with an E?

804
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,640
I did it both ways.

805
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,080
I did it once with an E and once with no E. How about, yeah, DDR PC?

806
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,080
DDR PC, let me see.

807
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,400
No, there's no DDR PC article either.

808
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,760
There's just a Dance Dance Revolution main article.

809
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,440
How is there no Mr. Spanky article on Wikipedia?

810
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,160
He's an important part of the culture.

811
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,560
Well, he's a DDR character.

812
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,600
You don't really deserve to know about Wikipedia articles.

813
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
I don't get it.

814
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Alright.

815
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,600
I'm sick of looking.

816
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Wait, no I'm not.

817
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,400
Yeah, there's no article for the Windows PC version of Dance Dance Revolution.

818
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Sadness.

819
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Alright.

820
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,200
Anyway, I'm done.

821
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,040
Anything else you want to share with us, GS68?

822
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,840
No, I'm good.

823
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,040
Alright, well have a good one GS68.

824
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,040
We'll talk to you next time.

825
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,040
Thanks, you too.

826
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,440
Bye-bye.

827
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,320
I'm hoping one of our Wikipedia faithful will somehow create that Mr. Spanky article.

828
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,880
That would be all kinds of awesome.

829
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,880
Let's go to another call.

830
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

831
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
Who's this?

832
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,880
Hey, guys.

833
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,880
Hello, Insanist.

834
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,520
Hello, Insanist.

835
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,800
What is on your mind?

836
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,040
I don't know if you guys know, but that Penny Arcade Expo thing went on, and if you can

837
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,640
tell, I have absolutely no voice from being at it all weekend.

838
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,760
Oh, wow.

839
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,920
I think Penny Arcade Expo should happen more often.

840
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,240
It kills your voice.

841
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,320
Yeah, fuck you too, buddy.

842
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
Alright.

843
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:31,160
Well, I wanted to go to Penny Arcade Expo really, really badly, but here's the hilarious

844
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
part.

845
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,880
The largest showing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show anywhere in the world was also this weekend

846
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,520
in Reno where they have like 4,000 people come out and see the movie, so I wanted to

847
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,520
go to that.

848
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,160
Penny Arcade Expo was also this weekend.

849
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,920
I wanted to go to that, but guess what trumped both of those things?

850
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,960
One of my best friends from college got married over the weekend, so I went to the wedding

851
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:50,960
on Saturday.

852
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,360
So congratulations, Amanda and Tom.

853
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,560
Wave, wave, wave hug, although I know they don't listen to this program, but they got

854
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,600
married, so I had to go.

855
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,400
Well, how was Penny Arcade Expo?

856
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,400
So you were there.

857
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,760
You were our man on the street.

858
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,480
What's going on?

859
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:10,080
Well, what was really disappointing was Sony really didn't bring much to the show.

860
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,600
In fact, it was something outside of Sony's booth that was for the Playstation 3, which

861
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,480
I gave the unofficial OLR seal of approval.

862
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,680
This game called Eye of Judgment.

863
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,320
It's a collectible card game that works with the PS3.

864
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,320
Wait a minute.

865
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,640
You gave the OLR award to the Eye of Judgment?

866
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,640
Yes.

867
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,040
Fired!

868
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,040
Have you played it?

869
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,040
No, I haven't.

870
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,800
I saw the tech demo and I was like, why?

871
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,000
We did kind of see it at E3, so I'm curious.

872
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,200
So you're being completely serious.

873
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,200
This game is awesome.

874
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,360
Okay, I won't give it the OLR, I'll give it the STFU, I'll leave that for you guys.

875
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,360
No, no, that's fine, but I'm just curious.

876
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,360
You're absolutely serious.

877
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,000
This game rocked.

878
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,120
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

879
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:55,880
I'm a huge CCG fan, and I've been, obviously, I'm a huge video games fan, and this was a

880
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,360
very good combination of the two.

881
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,520
It felt more interactive to me than just putting a piece of cardboard on the table.

882
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,720
I could actually see what was going on, and I thought the technology was good and it was

883
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,120
something different, which I'm always welcome to seeing.

884
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,120
The graphics were great, there weren't any glitches with reading the cards.

885
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,640
I had no problem with it, and really, Sony didn't bring much else to the table.

886
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,920
Oh, so I get it.

887
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,520
So you're giving the award to Eye of Judgment by default, because there were no other games

888
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,520
there.

889
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,920
There was nothing new from Sony there.

890
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,920
I see.

891
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
It was bad.

892
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,200
But was Eye of Judgment the best thing you saw on any system?

893
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,200
No.

894
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:42,560
I'll be getting to that, but my Wii award goes to Metroid Prime 3.

895
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,360
This game's amazing, and you need to all pick it up next week.

896
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,360
Why?

897
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,080
One, it has the best Wii remote controls I've ever seen.

898
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,640
The looking is fantastic, the shooting is fantastic, the motion controls are very intuitive

899
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,420
and a lot of fun.

900
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,920
But I didn't like Prime 1 and 2, well, I take that back, I kind of like Prime 2, the multiplayer

901
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,340
mode, but I found first person Metroid so hard to play, am I going to suddenly get over

902
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,440
it with number 3?

903
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,840
Will it bring me back?

904
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,260
I think I will.

905
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,800
The motion controls really make you feel like a part of the game, and some of the boss battles

906
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,800
are amazing.

907
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,000
I got to demo the Ridley boss battle.

908
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,600
I'm not going to spoil too much, but it was one of the coolest boss battles I've ever

909
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,600
fought.

910
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,600
Ever.

911
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,600
Did you get a rise out of it?

912
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:28,600
Yes, yes I did.

913
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,600
I knocked down there.

914
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,000
Did it make you feel excited in a special place?

915
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Sometimes.

916
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,680
Did you have to go back to your hotel room and take care of some business after playing

917
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,680
the demo?

918
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,940
No, because I had to go run tournaments, unfortunately.

919
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,940
I see.

920
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,380
Alright, so how about your Xbox 360 award?

921
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,000
And overall award.

922
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Rock Band.

923
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,200
No question.

924
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,160
This game is amazing, and yes, I know everybody in the chat room is like, hey, I played this

925
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,100
before, it's Guitar Freak Stromania.

926
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:01,360
And you're right, it is Guitar Freak Stromania and Karaoke Revolution, but it's with songs

927
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,500
that the mainstream people are going to know, and that's going to sell a lot of copies and

928
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,000
make harmonics a lot of money.

929
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,640
The interface is great, the controllers are great, the guitars for guitar, excuse me,

930
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,600
Rock Band feel like real guitars.

931
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:23,960
The fret buttons are colored on the top of the controller, rather, on the buttons themselves.

932
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,240
But it's the same layout as guitar here.

933
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,960
Here's my question for you, do you think if Rock Band does well, there'll be a pop band

934
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,960
that comes out?

935
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,680
Because, you know, I like shitty music, and there's just not a lot, I mean, Rock Band

936
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,160
actually has a lot of good music in it, but I like shitty music, so is there any hope

937
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,720
for me and my love of pop music?

938
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,320
If you would have brought me that question, I would have asked the harmonics guys.

939
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,640
Damn you.

940
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,180
But with them releasing Guitar Hero 80s, anything can happen.

941
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:55,040
So actually, I honestly wouldn't rule that out if, I mean, a lot of the songs in Guitar

942
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:02,200
Hero 80s weren't that great, but I think Pop Band could very well be a viable idea.

943
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,720
Going to comments from the chat room here, Zaku says, excuse me sir, but harmonics fucked

944
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,940
up the drums, nuff said.

945
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,600
Have you used them?

946
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,280
Oh wait, you can't respond in time.

947
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,000
No you didn't, they're great, they're very responsive.

948
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,960
My only beef is the Xbox button is in the way of the rightmost two drums, and that got

949
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,880
annoying a couple of times.

950
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,080
Tiger Claw says, Rob, don't give them any ideas, next thing you know there will be a

951
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,640
game called Boy Band.

952
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,520
Miklotov got all excited over there.

953
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,400
I think that's called Sing Star actually.

954
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,080
Yeah, it is probably called Sing Star, that would be so much fun.

955
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,040
You're not getting Rock Band, we all know you're going to get the High School Musical

956
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,080
Sing It game, so just buzz off.

957
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:50,720
I can't officially name this as a winner, but the finals for the Omega-Thon, if anybody's

958
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:56,240
not familiar with that, it packs picks a bunch of people who are pre-registered and plays

959
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,400
them at a bunch of video games.

960
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:03,880
It went from Jenga from the beginning to Halo 3 as the final.

961
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,680
They showed two new maps called, one was called Narrows, which is a hallway with vehicles

962
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,040
and it was a hell of a lot of fun.

963
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,400
The other one was called Guardian, which looked very base-like and showed off jump pads and

964
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,800
elevators and was really cool.

965
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,540
Some new weapons, a flame thrower will be in the game, fire grenades will be in the

966
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:29,500
game, a Spartan laser will be in the game, and this item called the Gravity Hammer, which

967
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,480
is the sword on steroids.

968
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,120
Huh, wow.

969
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,120
How did Halo 3 look?

970
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,920
Because a lot of people complained the beta didn't look that much better, it looked really

971
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,920
good.

972
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,920
Did it?

973
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,720
It looked really good.

974
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,840
What I was most impressed with is the heads-up display.

975
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,720
It got a big overhaul from Halo 2.

976
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:55,480
The shield meter is directly top-center on the screen, so you'll be seeing it at all

977
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,840
times.

978
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:03,160
They have your weapons and ammo in the upper right corner and it has icons and the button

979
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,200
instead of saying, press this button to pick up this now.

980
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:12,400
They streamlined it a lot and I really, really think this will get rid of the disappointment

981
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,040
that, at least in my opinion, was Halo 2.

982
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,280
Let's see, Gold Banjo says, yay fire.

983
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,000
GS68 though asks, any word on the man cannon?

984
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:28,720
I did not see a man cannon, but there is a plasma cannon that you could, it was mounted

985
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,920
but you could yank it out and run after people with it, which is pretty cool.

986
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,920
All right.

987
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,560
Well, anything else you want to share from Penny Arcade Expo since you were lucky enough

988
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,560
to go?

989
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,560
Two things.

990
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:44,920
One, the fragdoll stole a flowchart about boobs that I made and two, Wil Wheaton kicked

991
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,720
my ass at Guitar Hero.

992
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,040
You poor thing.

993
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,040
That was pretty cool.

994
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,040
He's a good sport about it.

995
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,040
Wow.

996
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,200
But that's about it.

997
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,640
Penny Arcade Expo is great.

998
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,880
I wish you guys were there.

999
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,480
Wait, how the hell did you end up playing Guitar Hero with Wil Wheaton?

1000
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,480
Was it just by chance?

1001
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,760
Well, Matt and he entered the tournament and beforehand he was in there warming up and

1002
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,720
asked if I could get a game with him because I'm probably not going to get a chance to

1003
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,720
play and he's like, sure.

1004
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,600
And we played a Let's Talk More Rock Expert and he kicked my ass.

1005
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
Wow.

1006
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,600
Huh.

1007
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:13,600
Something else.

1008
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,600
All right.

1009
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,600
Well, Insanus, thank you so much for the call and a real quick plug for your show if you'd

1010
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
like.

1011
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:25,600
STFU every Thursday at seven followed by the Insanus hour if I'm up to it whenever STFU

1012
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,600
is over.

1013
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,600
All right.

1014
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,960
Good to see that there is some weekday programming still happening on the station on Thursdays

1015
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,680
and occasionally on Tuesdays, not so much on Wednesdays.

1016
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,680
And if I have any spare swag left over, I will either be giving it to you guys or away

1017
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,680
to listeners.

1018
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,680
Hoorah.

1019
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,680
More on that on Thursday.

1020
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,680
All right.

1021
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,320
Well, I was just going to say, speaking of Tuesday, I will be live this week.

1022
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,320
Hooray.

1023
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,320
Yay.

1024
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,320
I have something to do on Tuesday.

1025
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,320
But I won't be here on next Sunday.

1026
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,620
But I will not be here on Wednesday because I'm in LA for four days.

1027
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,840
I won't be here next Sunday because of something very special.

1028
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,840
And that would be-

1029
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,520
I have one more request because you haven't done it tomorrow.

1030
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,920
Well, let Jamie finish your thought and then you can have your turn.

1031
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,920
Yes, Jamie.

1032
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,920
Okay.

1033
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,920
It's the weekend of my second wedding anniversary.

1034
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,920
Well, congratulations.

1035
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,920
Yay, Jamie.

1036
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,440
So I will be making Dan buy me expensive food on Saturday and he's taking me to Weird Al

1037
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,440
on Sunday.

1038
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,440
All right.

1039
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,160
It should be an interesting show Sunday because Labor Day weekend and everything.

1040
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,160
So we'll see.

1041
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,160
We'll still be tracking you.

1042
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,160
I'll be here if we do a drunk show.

1043
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,160
Hmm.

1044
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,160
Hmm.

1045
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:31,160
Maybe, you know, I don't have any plans for Monday.

1046
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,160
Hmm.

1047
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,160
The plot thickens.

1048
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,160
All right, DMN.

1049
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,440
What was your one more thought?

1050
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,320
You haven't hung up on me in a while.

1051
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,320
You're right.

1052
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,320
So I should do that now.

1053
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,320
All right.

1054
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:47,240
If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1055
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,320
We'll take one more call.

1056
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,320
Yeah.

1057
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,320
DMN goes by Insanus now.

1058
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,320
I don't know why.

1059
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,400
Why did Prince change his name?

1060
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,400
He just did.

1061
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,680
No, he did because his name was copyrighted by the label he was on before.

1062
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,800
Do you always have to know everything?

1063
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,800
Yes.

1064
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:08,760
To DMN slash Insanus slash whatever your name's going to be tomorrow, if you don't sign on

1065
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,160
to WoW, I'm going to get somebody to kick you out of the guild because you're being

1066
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,760
too inactive.

1067
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,760
And I don't like that.

1068
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,760
Thank you.

1069
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,760
All right.

1070
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,220
Well, I'd like to go to another call now.

1071
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,160
You can use your WoW guild chat some other time, Miklotov, okay?

1072
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,400
Wait, you can't kick him from the guild because you don't have WoW.

1073
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,280
You had to cancel WoW.

1074
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,280
All right.

1075
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,280
We got to go back to the phones.

1076
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,280
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1077
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,280
Who's this?

1078
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,280
Hey, it's AZHP.

1079
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,280
Hello, AZHP.

1080
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,080
Sorry to make you listen to our bickering.

1081
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:43,000
As SSJ100Matt says in the chat, oh no, guild drama.

1082
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,600
Although I should say, if you want to join the OL Army Guild, which is actually called

1083
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:53,080
Order of Valtiel, it's on the Ravencrest server horde side, and it's fun, lots of fun.

1084
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,520
I don't know why you say it's an OrangeLounge Guild.

1085
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,880
It's my guild.

1086
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,520
It's more Silent Hill than anything.

1087
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,520
Because it's the one I play on, and you play on it, and some of the other people that have

1088
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,320
been on the show in the past play on it.

1089
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:08,520
Plus, if it was not an OLR Guild, we wouldn't have gotten some of our great players, like

1090
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,280
Eddie is on there, and Aliestor or whatever plays it.

1091
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,120
Two people.

1092
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,660
And then a bunch of people will join and level their characters to five, and then we never

1093
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,800
see them again.

1094
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,480
So we've had like two or three that have stuck with it, but that's about it.

1095
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,840
I'm there, but I just don't play that much.

1096
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,240
Speaking of people who leveled to level five and then quit.

1097
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,680
No, I will add to eight with my team, and then I started...

1098
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,680
Oh, sorry, eight.

1099
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,840
Okay, okay, okay.

1100
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,840
I will play World of Warcraft on some day.

1101
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,760
And DMN sent me a private message.

1102
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,520
Tell me, Glattov, I quit WoW.

1103
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,920
Then I'm sad.

1104
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,560
All right, anyway, sorry AZHP has been waiting on the line very patiently, you poor bastard.

1105
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,040
What's on your mind?

1106
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,680
Speaking of WoW, after I got off the phone last week with you guys, you said that I might

1107
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:03,200
have bought this budget computer for WoW, and no, I'm not a WoW player.

1108
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,200
Really?

1109
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,880
Oh, because that's right, you emailed us, and we said something about you had the budget...

1110
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,920
You said something about buying a budget computer, right?

1111
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,040
Yeah, well, I Skyped in last week, and I said that I bought a budget computer, and you thought

1112
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,920
that it was for WoW, and no, I've seen what WoW does to my friends, and I don't want to

1113
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,840
become a recovering WoW addict.

1114
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,640
Ironic that we're yelling about WoW the minute you call in.

1115
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,680
That's why you were snickering to yourself.

1116
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,560
Is that all you wanted to say?

1117
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,920
No, well, I didn't catch the mailbag this week.

1118
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,480
You guys read my email?

1119
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,800
I don't know, maybe.

1120
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,680
We read a lot of emails, so I don't know if we...

1121
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,280
I think I heard your name come up.

1122
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,520
All right, awesome.

1123
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,520
Well, yeah.

1124
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,480
You know, you could always just download part A, and then you'll find out.

1125
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:56,080
Well, yeah, I played the Bioshock demo, and I was looking at picking it up, because it's

1126
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,080
so awesome, right?

1127
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,240
Oh, yeah, we read this email, yeah.

1128
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:04,720
Yeah, and I just read a lot of controversy on the forums, like, oh, if you buy the game,

1129
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:10,960
you can only register it on two computers, and after that, your CD won't work anymore

1130
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,400
on any other computers that you have.

1131
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,480
That and your computer will be reported to the Motion Picture Association of America.

1132
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,440
Why they do that, I don't know, but it's just more negative stuff to happen.

1133
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,360
And little gnomes will come live inside your computer, and if you don't feed them before

1134
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,600
midnight, then your computer will grow legs and walk away.

1135
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,960
I mean, the coffee protection on Bioshock is just that bad.

1136
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:37,660
Yeah, actually, people have said that rootkits were installed, like the Sony's old rootkits

1137
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:43,000
that pretty much just monitored everything on your computer, so I'm thinking of waiting

1138
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,320
until that stuff gets all settled down, people start throwing lawsuits at 2K and stuff, more

1139
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,320
lawsuits.

1140
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,420
Yes, and actually, Big Brother is watching your computer and sending daily reports to

1141
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,160
Amber who's crying about them right now.

1142
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,160
Bad joke, sorry.

1143
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,040
If you get that, you need a life like I do.

1144
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,400
See, Miklotov's booing me, I know he needs it, all right.

1145
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,520
Anything else you want to share, ACHP?

1146
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:11,440
Probably, but it all got lost in the randomness, so I guess that's about it.

1147
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,600
That's like the tagline of this show, it all gets lost in the randomness, so there you

1148
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,600
go.

1149
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,600
That is pretty excellent.

1150
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,880
Oh, actually, one more thing.

1151
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,880
Yes.

1152
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,200
Yeah, about the Wii outselling the Xbox 360, and you guys are all wondering, oh, it's not

1153
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,400
the hardcore gamers who's buying all the stuff for it, it's just Wii Sports, Wii Play.

1154
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,480
Well, it's a mix.

1155
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,480
It's a mix.

1156
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,480
Yeah.

1157
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,360
I mean, keep in mind we were reading some chat comments there, too.

1158
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,360
I think it's a mix.

1159
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:40,040
I think you've got both the hardcore gamers and soccer moms buying it, and that's why

1160
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:45,440
it's doing so well, but I think for a lot of hardcore gamers, the magic is dying off,

1161
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,280
you know, and hopefully, Metroid is going to bring that back, and Super Smash Brothers

1162
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,840
certainly will bring that back, but, you know, I feel like it's the DS launch all over again,

1163
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,840
really.

1164
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,840
It's the DS launch all over again.

1165
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,540
You had a bunch of great games at the beginning, and then, like, a year of deadness with the

1166
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,960
occasional gem, and now we're going to get back into overdrive.

1167
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:09,120
Yeah, I mean, like, from next week until four months from now, we've got, like, great releases

1168
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,480
coming every month.

1169
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,940
You got Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Brothers.

1170
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,960
You got Battalion Wars.

1171
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,920
Everything's just, like, coming out one after another.

1172
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,080
Well, it's about freaking time, right?

1173
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,080
Yeah, definitely.

1174
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,080
All right.

1175
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,080
All right.

1176
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,080
I haven't touched...

1177
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,880
I haven't bought a new game for my Wii since Ellipitz.

1178
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,640
I mean, the last one I bought was Super Paper Mario, and I barely played it.

1179
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,080
I feel like a dummy for even buying it, because I barely played it, but...

1180
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,080
Oh, well.

1181
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,080
All right.

1182
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,080
Well, AZHP, thanks so much for the call.

1183
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,640
We've got to go and wrap things up, okay?

1184
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,640
All right, then.

1185
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,640
All right.

1186
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,640
Later, sir.

1187
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:42,640
Bye.

1188
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,640
All right.

1189
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,640
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1190
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,760
If you didn't get through, so sorry, but try again next week.

1191
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,840
We had some long calls tonight that kind of took up all our time, so if you're mad we

1192
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,440
didn't get to your call, just blame Insanus, because his call went on for about nine minutes.

1193
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,440
All right.

1194
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,440
Just kidding.

1195
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,480
Let's get to the listless results, shall we, before we get to the last-minute stories,

1196
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,160
because you still had some last-minute stories, right, Loki?

1197
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,160
Yes.

1198
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,280
Maybe Dark Sakura has a few as well?

1199
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,280
Yeah, no.

1200
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,280
All right.

1201
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,280
Yeah, no.

1202
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,480
All right.

1203
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,200
Let's get to tonight's listless results.

1204
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,240
In third place for the character we would most like to see in the new track and field

1205
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:22,480
game, Dracula is the character that people would like to see third most in their DDR

1206
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,480
game.

1207
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:30,320
In second place for a character that we most want to see in track and field, Mr. Spanky

1208
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:36,640
comes in second place, and what could possibly top Mr. Spanky for the number one character

1209
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,720
you most want to see in track and field on the DS?

1210
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,160
The left DDR arrow is the number one.

1211
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,160
Yay.

1212
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,240
So make it happen, Konami.

1213
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,560
That's the first time I've ever won.

1214
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,560
I'm so excited.

1215
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,840
How many listless games have you played with us?

1216
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,840
Like ten, probably.

1217
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,960
Well, congratulations.

1218
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,280
Poor Loki in Dark Sakura got X'd out that round.

1219
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,280
I'm sorry.

1220
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,280
Kids?

1221
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,280
Oh, well.

1222
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,880
That's okay, because of several times I've won the entire thing by myself.

1223
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,920
Well, of several times.

1224
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,920
Shut up.

1225
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,680
Why are you being mean to me?

1226
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,280
Because you let me.

1227
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,520
Heart.

1228
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,160
Hearts make it better.

1229
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,720
Don't throw napkins at me.

1230
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,720
That will just make me meaner.

1231
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,000
Yes, make it tough.

1232
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,960
I realized like ten minutes ago that it would have been better to do the right DDR arrow

1233
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,480
because it's pointing in the direction of like the running on the screen.

1234
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,480
The left DDR arrow makes even less sense now that I think about it.

1235
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,760
It makes you run away.

1236
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,320
But it makes it funnier.

1237
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:40,160
Anyway, Loki, last minute stories.

1238
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:47,240
So there was some other stuff other than the Eye of Judgment announced for the PlayStation

1239
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,720
Eye.

1240
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:54,120
One of which is the Towers of Topac, which is apparently a game where you roll around

1241
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,960
this giant ball down this tower using your body.

1242
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,560
Sounds like a shitload of fun.

1243
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,560
Hurrah.

1244
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:06,880
I will use the Eye of Judgment to roll a giant ball down a hill is what you're saying.

1245
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,880
Something like that.

1246
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,400
That sounds like totem ball.

1247
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,780
I love totem ball.

1248
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,880
It's not exactly a totem ball.

1249
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:19,040
Basically it's a top down view and each of the little platforms that you're on is actually

1250
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,920
an image of your screen.

1251
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,560
So you actually are on multiple little platforms there.

1252
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,560
I don't know.

1253
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,560
It's weird.

1254
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,120
Not something I would buy though.

1255
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,120
Let's see here.

1256
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:39,080
Also, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, which is rumored to be out this year, according to an interview

1257
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:45,760
with some people working the Sony booth at Lipsig, that actually I guess with the series

1258
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:54,240
creator Kazunori Yamauchi has confirmed himself.

1259
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:59,800
He said that yes, it will be a free download on the PSN and we're thinking of charging,

1260
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,800
but doubt it.

1261
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,640
For now it's free.

1262
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,520
So I think it was actually supposed to contain quite a bit of stuff.

1263
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:13,440
They were saying, I want to say it was like quite a few cars and about 16 tracks or something

1264
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,440
like that.

1265
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,020
I think it was like 50 cars.

1266
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,000
So that would be pretty sweet if it was free.

1267
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,520
Then I wouldn't have to buy the actual game.

1268
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,040
Anyways, let's see.

1269
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:32,380
Other than that, there was one other thing I was going to say that they've partially

1270
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:37,000
cracked the Xbox 360 kernel.

1271
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,520
Now that allows you to download or downgrade from any kernel without using a computer key

1272
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,520
is possible.

1273
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:52,680
So what that'll allow you to do is drop your firmware down to a level where you can put

1274
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,760
homebrew stuff on it.

1275
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,360
Not fully functional, but getting close.

1276
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,680
All right.

1277
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,040
Is that it?

1278
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,040
That's it.

1279
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,040
All right.

1280
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,440
Lots of last minute stories tonight.

1281
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,200
Well, that's about it for the show tonight.

1282
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,960
Thank you guys so much for tuning into us and listening to us tonight.

1283
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,320
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1284
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,840
Miklotov, thank you for being here.

1285
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,840
I didn't have a choice.

1286
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,040
Are you going to be here next week for our maybe drunk show?

1287
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,000
I don't think I have a choice.

1288
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,440
Well, I'm glad you have such enthusiasm with this program.

1289
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,080
Maybe I'll lift my ban on drinking for myself.

1290
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,800
That would be fun.

1291
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:34,080
I think we might have to do a drunk show after all.

1292
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,560
So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1293
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,080
Miklotov, your final thought.

1294
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,680
I don't know.

1295
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,840
Loki, your final thought.

1296
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:49,100
My final thought is they had some people, I guess, at Leipzig that were just completely

1297
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,900
naked except they were painted on.

1298
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,200
That's what we need to see at E3.

1299
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,200
Painted chicks.

1300
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,020
They're topless.

1301
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:02,240
My final thought is Mike and Ike's are yummy and I just found one left in the bag.

1302
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,960
Delicious.

1303
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,480
Dark Soccer, your final thought.

1304
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,480
Gross.

1305
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,480
You don't like Mike and Ike's?

1306
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,360
They're one of the candies I can't eat because I'm allergic to one of the ingredients.

1307
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,600
It's like a gelatin something.

1308
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:18,680
Same with Starburst and gum makes me nauseous when I smell it.

1309
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,080
I'm trying to figure out what the name of the ingredient would be.

1310
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,760
It's something like Jamie Repellent.

1311
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,760
Jamie Repellent.

1312
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,760
Oh, look.

1313
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,760
It's right in there.

1314
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:28,760
Jamie Repellent number five.

1315
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:29,760
Who knew?

1316
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,760
All right.

1317
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,680
Of course, thanks you guys so much for tuning in to and downloading our show or tuning in

1318
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,680
live.

1319
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,680
We appreciate it.

1320
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,000
Remember, if you like what we do here, please, or even if you don't like what we do here,

1321
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,560
please help us spread the word of independent radio nonetheless.

1322
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,880
Tell two people about your show.

1323
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,520
They don't have to be your friends because we'll take your enemies listening to the show

1324
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,720
too because we just like to get the word out.

1325
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:53,600
We don't get a lot of money to promote our program so we rely on word of mouth.

1326
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,600
Please leave your reviews on iTunes and get the word out there and all that good stuff.

1327
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,080
We appreciate it.

1328
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,080
That's it.

1329
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,080
We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1330
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:07,480
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
