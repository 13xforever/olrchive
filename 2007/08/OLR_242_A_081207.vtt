00:00.000 --> 00:19.760
Is the Xbox 360 Core on its way out?

00:19.760 --> 00:24.640
New details on Super Mario Galaxy, and is it really possible to now play NES games on

00:24.640 --> 00:26.640
your iPhone?

00:26.640 --> 00:32.640
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.640 --> 00:36.280
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:36.280 --> 00:37.280
Lounge Radio.

00:37.280 --> 00:41.600
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:41.600 --> 00:42.760
lifestyle.

00:42.760 --> 00:47.120
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be here with you all night long, as will my lovely co-host,

00:47.120 --> 00:48.880
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:48.880 --> 00:49.880
Hi.

00:49.880 --> 00:51.880
And how are you doing, Jamie?

00:51.880 --> 00:53.640
Uh, full of burrito.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.640
Mmm, yummy burrito.

00:54.640 --> 00:55.640
Shrimpy burritos.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.080
Just shrimp?

00:57.080 --> 00:58.080
No red meat tonight?

00:58.080 --> 01:00.680
No, I'm not going to be eating red meat anymore.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.320
Are you going on one of those funky diet things?

01:03.320 --> 01:05.680
Well, out of necessity, I can't.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.400
Every so often, I get to where I can't actually eat it very safely.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
Oh.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.040
Because I was going to say, you can't have diet without dye.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.040
I don't diet.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.680
I have lifestyle adjustments.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.240
I see.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.240
That's a clever little work-around.

01:17.240 --> 01:20.600
Alright, also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.760
So would a funky diet be like pizza and disco or something?

01:23.760 --> 01:25.600
I mean, would that be a funky diet?

01:25.600 --> 01:27.360
Would that be eating dirty food?

01:27.360 --> 01:28.360
Why?

01:28.360 --> 01:29.360
Is that what your life is like right now?

01:29.360 --> 01:30.360
No.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.360
Disco and pizza?

01:31.360 --> 01:33.480
Yes, everything's all disco and pizza.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.200
Whatever happened to discos?

01:36.200 --> 01:38.640
You know, my mom still calls clubs discos.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.640
The discotheque.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.640
No.

01:40.640 --> 01:41.640
I'm doing okay.

01:41.640 --> 01:42.640
Alright.

01:42.640 --> 01:43.640
Well, I had pizza.

01:43.640 --> 01:44.640
You had pizza?

01:44.640 --> 01:45.640
Yes.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
Was it good pizza?

01:46.640 --> 01:47.640
Yes.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.640
So I'm halfway there on the diet.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.640
Alright.

01:49.640 --> 01:50.640
Yeah, fully commit on the funky diet.

01:50.640 --> 01:55.120
Well, I say welcome back because obviously we were off two weeks ago and then last week

01:55.120 --> 01:59.480
was kind of a weird show because we were at Studio Loki, which was a temporary setup.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.500
We are kind of in the new studio now.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.320
We're not out in the garage, which is where we want to be, where we're going to have the

02:04.320 --> 02:09.440
retro gaming setup and the webcam and everything, just because we don't have the air conditioning

02:09.440 --> 02:11.480
yet out there and it's too hot.

02:11.480 --> 02:15.240
So we're in the little studio, but the good news is we're back on the normal computers

02:15.240 --> 02:20.560
and the normal network setup and all that good stuff, so the sound of the show should

02:20.560 --> 02:23.240
be pretty much what you guys are used to, at least I hope.

02:23.240 --> 02:28.160
Save some minor echo and probably things you probably can't even really hear on your iPods.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.720
So we're happy to be back.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.480
And also we're happy to have you back, Jamie.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.360
And I know a lot of folks were thinking about you last week, so I hope everything was okay.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.160
It was interesting.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.160
Alright.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.040
Well, we'll leave it at that.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.880
Let's talk about games instead and talk about your interesting experience at California

02:43.880 --> 02:44.880
Extreme.

02:44.880 --> 02:45.880
You just got back from yesterday.

02:45.880 --> 02:46.880
Yes.

02:46.880 --> 02:47.880
At two in the morning.

02:47.880 --> 02:48.880
Oh my God.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.600
What exactly is California Extreme?

02:51.600 --> 02:55.000
It's a pinball and classic gaming convention of sorts.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.960
They had an auction there, but as far as I know, it wasn't actually part of California

02:59.960 --> 03:00.960
Extreme.

03:00.960 --> 03:04.880
But I did play a whole crap ton of games and finally beat Space Harrier.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.880
I saw your LJ post about beating Space Harrier.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.520
I sure did.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.720
It was fantastic.

03:10.720 --> 03:14.000
I forgot that it just says the end.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.720
So they just get a bunch of random games together and call it an expo?

03:17.720 --> 03:19.240
Yeah, some of them are for sale.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.240
Oh, okay.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.240
Well, that's pretty cool.

03:21.240 --> 03:25.760
Big Bang Bar, which was the first thing I went right to, I ran into, well, actually

03:25.760 --> 03:33.040
I met up with Mel and Melody and the first thing that she and I did was go right up and

03:33.040 --> 03:40.160
play Big Bang Bar, which was one of the last machines Capcom made.

03:40.160 --> 03:45.760
But they only had about 16 prototypes and now there's production models of them.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.920
Well, I should say reproduction models.

03:47.920 --> 03:56.060
But the one that we played was a legitimate prototype and then it was just mostly wandering

03:56.060 --> 03:57.680
around and she was playing Star Wars.

03:57.680 --> 04:02.760
I got to play Ultra Pin, which was kind of interesting.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.080
It's Ultra Cade's answer to pinball.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.720
Oh, I think you talked about this on the show once.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.160
Isn't it like they used an LCD but laid flat instead?

04:10.160 --> 04:11.160
Yeah.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.160
How does that work?

04:12.160 --> 04:13.160
Is it good?

04:13.160 --> 04:14.160
It was interesting.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.120
The perspective kind of messed with my head a little bit.

04:16.120 --> 04:20.160
I played Black Knight 2000 on it, which was pretty cool.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.480
And then I was like, screw this, I went to play a real Black Knight 2000.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.800
I was like, woohoo, Black Knight.

04:25.800 --> 04:30.160
Now, did they bring any developers to this show or is there anybody like, you know, game

04:30.160 --> 04:31.160
famous or whatever?

04:31.160 --> 04:32.160
Or is it just...

04:32.160 --> 04:35.560
I didn't go to any of the panels because I was like, dude, pinball.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.560
So they do have live panels and some things.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.560
They did not have a pinbot, Rob.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.560
Or a jackpot.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.560
Cry and Sadness.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.560
Do they have Bride of...

04:42.560 --> 04:43.560
Well, you have Bride of Pinbot in your house.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.560
I have Bride.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.560
No, they didn't have that.

04:45.560 --> 04:46.760
You're so badass, by the way.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.400
I played Vortex, which is one of the mid-80s.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.400
Oh, I remember Vortex.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.400
That's a cool one.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.400
But I played one of the best tables ever.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.400
It's called Airborne.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.560
It's one of Capcom's.

04:57.560 --> 04:58.560
It's all ramps.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.120
It's all ramps.

05:00.120 --> 05:04.160
It's just a bajillion ramps everywhere and it was fun and they had it on like a bajillion

05:04.160 --> 05:05.160
buy-ins.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.700
It was crazy.

05:06.700 --> 05:09.880
So did you play anything besides Space Harrier and pinball?

05:09.880 --> 05:10.880
Words.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.800
Yes, I did.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.180
I didn't play Journey.

05:15.180 --> 05:16.180
They got Journey working.

05:16.180 --> 05:17.180
They had Journey?

05:17.180 --> 05:18.180
Yes.

05:18.180 --> 05:19.180
Oh my god, I should have gone.

05:19.180 --> 05:22.200
I was trying to go but I couldn't because I had other stuff going on.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.200
What else did I play?

05:23.200 --> 05:25.320
Oh, what I would give to play a Journey arcade machine.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.320
I played Mappy.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.320
Huh.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.320
I played...

05:28.320 --> 05:30.860
Well, Julie played a bunch of Crystal Castles.

05:30.860 --> 05:35.760
Every time I ran into her, she's either playing Crystal Castles or Pac-Man.

05:35.760 --> 05:41.720
They had a Tapper, Rob, that someone had messed with the sprites and it was all Simpsons characters.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.720
Well, that's weird.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.720
And Mo was the bartender.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.440
That's pretty cool.

05:47.440 --> 05:54.960
And they had, I played SVC Chaos because I had to get my fighting game on and I played

05:54.960 --> 05:58.720
some X-Men vs. Street Fighter so I could use the most annoying team ever.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.560
See, Dan and I, when we first got together, we played a whole crap ton of that game on

06:02.560 --> 06:07.280
Saturn and I used to always have this one combo that would just piss him off and annoy

06:07.280 --> 06:10.540
him so much that he would just quit.

06:10.540 --> 06:13.480
And that was Cammy and Gambit.

06:13.480 --> 06:17.760
Note to everybody, if ever you play against my husband, Cammy and Gambit, he will get

06:17.760 --> 06:18.760
mad.

06:18.760 --> 06:19.760
So, anyway.

06:19.760 --> 06:24.160
I played a few other things, though.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.120
I played some Dig Dug.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.680
I had Dig Dug.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.680
That was cool.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.680
They had a sit-down Star Wars.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.880
They had an Empire Strikes Back arcade machine, which was really cool.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.480
They had Discs of Tron.

06:35.480 --> 06:36.480
Rad.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.880
They had Tron.

06:38.880 --> 06:39.960
Not a lot of new stuff, though.

06:39.960 --> 06:40.960
It's all retro stuff.

06:40.960 --> 06:41.960
Oh, yeah.

06:41.960 --> 06:42.960
It's all retro.

06:42.960 --> 06:43.960
I remember there was one year...

06:43.960 --> 06:44.960
Oh!

06:44.960 --> 06:45.960
They had Panic Park.

06:45.960 --> 06:46.960
What the hell is that?

06:46.960 --> 06:47.960
I've never heard of that.

06:47.960 --> 06:48.960
Panic Park is this great game.

06:48.960 --> 06:52.520
I think they have one at Milpitas Golf Land where there's a big one and then there's a

06:52.520 --> 06:53.520
small one.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.520
They had an actual Japanese one there, but they had the bad Engrish-y one.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.920
It's a game where you have these... one person's on one side and the other person's on another.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.920
You have to play with another person and you have a big stick and it slides around.

07:04.920 --> 07:10.340
You are competing with somebody in mini-games and it's best however many out of however

07:10.340 --> 07:15.120
many and you push them aside or they push you aside using this big stick when you're

07:15.120 --> 07:18.680
like grabbing hula hoops as they come from the ground or grabbing coins or jumping from

07:18.680 --> 07:20.440
thing to thing or avoiding hammers falling on you.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.040
I have never heard of this.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.680
It's fantastic.

07:23.680 --> 07:28.800
And I've actually played with Dan's buddy, Will, and Will is really strong, okay?

07:28.800 --> 07:30.320
So I had a hard time.

07:30.320 --> 07:36.520
We ended up... he won two matches, I won two matches, and we had a draw of three matches

07:36.520 --> 07:39.080
so we actually had a perfect draw game.

07:39.080 --> 07:43.120
I gotta read some comments from chat because your comments on old gaming is sparking a

07:43.120 --> 07:46.200
lot of discussion in chat and of course since I haven't introduced them yet, say hello to

07:46.200 --> 07:51.040
our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com and let's see, we have GS68 says, I was at

07:51.040 --> 07:54.520
Milpitas Golf Land on Thursday, I don't remember seeing a game like that so maybe it wasn't

07:54.520 --> 07:55.520
there.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.520
Maybe it was at Sunnyvale or something.

07:56.520 --> 07:59.200
Kevin DDR says, Oh my God, Panic Park, hell yeah.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.160
So somebody knows what you're talking about there.

08:01.160 --> 08:05.680
Sakura Max says, He's confused, he's the youngest guy so he doesn't know about these old ass

08:05.680 --> 08:06.680
games.

08:06.680 --> 08:07.680
Well, it's time to learn.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.040
It's time to step up and learn.

08:09.040 --> 08:14.080
Dude, just, okay, whenever you go to an arcade, all you have to do is just look around and

08:14.080 --> 08:15.080
look for the older stuff.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.080
Oh, they had...

08:16.080 --> 08:17.080
Look for the games that still only cost one token.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.080
They had cocktail machines.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.520
Tons of cocktail tables.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.720
And they were playing music videos and they freaking played Warrant.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.380
It was great.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.840
You know, the other thing I was going to say is that Xbox Live Arcade is slowly getting

08:28.840 --> 08:30.200
a lot of these classic games on it.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.800
I mean, you know that Tron and Distro-Tron are coming out for it.

08:32.800 --> 08:35.480
Dig Dug, which you mentioned, is already on Xbox Live Arcade.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.680
There are a lot of classics that are on there.

08:37.680 --> 08:40.400
Sakura Max asks if GameTap would help them or not.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.400
Probably.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
Probably.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.320
I mean, they certainly have a collection of old stuff on there, although I've been called

08:45.320 --> 08:49.080
a GameTap whore too much on this program so I don't want to sound like an advertisement.

08:49.080 --> 08:53.240
They also, though, had some of the little bar top machines.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.580
Oh, cool.

08:54.580 --> 08:56.200
Like the little, like, what do they call it?

08:56.200 --> 08:57.200
Mega Touch and that stuff?

08:57.200 --> 09:01.880
Yeah, but they were actually the ones with the controllers and everything on them.

09:01.880 --> 09:12.000
And they had an actual Pong and they had the small child-sized machines, the SNK machines.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Cool.

09:13.000 --> 09:18.380
The Neo Geo one, sorry, with, like, you know, Puzzle Bobble.

09:18.380 --> 09:21.360
So it sounds like you had a lot of fun and it sounds like I really missed out getting

09:21.360 --> 09:22.360
to see Journey Machine.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.760
I did get to find, though, some of my favorite old tables were there, though, like Centaur.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.720
They had a Hyperball, which I refused to ever play again.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.720
Stupid fucking Hyperball.

09:30.720 --> 09:36.000
And they had, um, I'm sorry, I'm trying to watch my language.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
That's all right.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.280
Watch it fly out of your mouth and offend people.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.280
Bye.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
There you go, language, have fun.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.680
So did you play any, like, new games this week or was it all pretty much retro gaming

09:45.680 --> 09:46.680
goodness?

09:46.680 --> 09:50.560
Um, I played the Ultra Pin.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.800
All right.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.120
That's technically new.

09:54.120 --> 10:03.880
I played DDR, I played Max 2.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.040
That is kind of old school as well.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.880
I played Cowgirl in flip flops.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.880
All right.

10:07.880 --> 10:13.480
It was fun, it was actually kind of funny, I was like, dude, I am going to fall over

10:13.480 --> 10:14.480
and I didn't.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.480
It was great.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.720
All right, well, next year the dude with the Journey Machine needs to come back to California

10:17.720 --> 10:20.520
Extreme so I can play it, or I'll be sad.

10:20.520 --> 10:25.360
But my World Cup soccer is almost, um, fixed up nice.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.360
Oh!

10:26.360 --> 10:30.920
This is what pisses me off, it's not really an F-you, it's just a, huh?

10:30.920 --> 10:36.680
The one Theater of Magic they had, and the entire place was at the tournament area.

10:36.680 --> 10:40.000
Unless you pay to do the stupid tournament and you can't play the Theater of Magic, I'm

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
like, uh-huh!

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Theater of Magic!

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Theater of Magic's a pretty bad-ass revelation.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I did play the Devil's Madness, though.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.040
I knocked down the castle, it was great.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.160
All right, we've got to move on, but it sounds like you've got a lot of good gaming in, even

10:50.160 --> 10:52.120
if most of it was pinball, not console games.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.120
Pinball!

10:53.120 --> 10:54.120
Pinball's pretty rad.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.120
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

10:55.120 --> 10:56.760
Um, it was okay.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.360
Before I get into my gaming week, though, I wanted to talk about, there was this game

10:59.360 --> 11:01.680
that I saw that was coming out later.

11:01.680 --> 11:07.400
Now, you know, I dogged Neo Geo, or not Neo Geo, SNK for Never coming up with new games.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.920
This actually sounds pretty cool, and I think we talked about it a little bit before, Neo

11:10.920 --> 11:12.480
Geo Battle Colosseum.

11:12.480 --> 11:18.840
It's a fighting game that features, like, an ensemble cast of all the past Neo Geo games,

11:18.840 --> 11:24.280
including King of Fighters, Fatal Fury, Mark of the Wolves, Samurai Shodown, Art of Fighting,

11:24.280 --> 11:31.400
Last Blade, King of the Monsters, World Heroes, Athena, Aggressors of Dark Combat, Kizuna,

11:31.400 --> 11:32.960
Tag Battle, and Metal Slug.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.760
Dude, you said Last Blade, and that makes me happy.

11:35.760 --> 11:40.680
Wait, so you could have, like, my fighting one of the monsters from King of Monsters?

11:40.680 --> 11:46.280
And if I remember correctly, this isn't being published every year by SNK, but it is coming

11:46.280 --> 11:50.920
out in October, and I think it's cheap, and it's on PlayStation 2, so that seemed pretty

11:50.920 --> 11:51.920
cool.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.920
Anyways, I just thought that was neat.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.440
Now, actually, the games that I played this week, I played the demo for Stranglehold,

11:57.440 --> 11:58.600
which was actually pretty fun.

11:58.600 --> 12:02.200
It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be, with a lot of running around,

12:02.200 --> 12:06.240
flying through the air, shooting things in slow-mo, so that's pretty cool.

12:06.240 --> 12:11.080
And then I also tried the Fatal Inertia demo, which, you know, I've been really hyped up

12:11.080 --> 12:16.320
about the game ever since they first announced it, because they reminded me of, like, you

12:16.320 --> 12:21.760
know, kind of like F-Zero GX or something like that, you know, a combat racing game.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.160
That was not the case with this.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.820
This is crap.

12:24.820 --> 12:28.200
And I, thank God I played the demo, because I'm not buying the game now.

12:28.200 --> 12:32.440
It's just, it's hard to control, and it didn't seem that fast, and, I don't know, I just

12:32.440 --> 12:36.860
didn't like the level layout, it wasn't pretty enough for me, so, oh well.

12:36.860 --> 12:44.900
And then, let's see, I also played 300 on the PSP, because I had just watched the Blu-ray

12:44.900 --> 12:49.720
for it, so, that game sucks also.

12:49.720 --> 12:50.720
But what do you expect?

12:50.720 --> 12:51.720
Why?

12:51.720 --> 12:52.720
It's just a hack and slash game.

12:52.720 --> 12:53.720
It's like a movie tie-in game.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.800
Well, that's not what the movie was?

12:55.800 --> 12:56.800
I don't know, I didn't see the movie, so.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.440
Yeah, well the movie was a lot better than that, so.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.660
I'm the one guy that didn't see 300.

13:01.660 --> 13:07.760
And then, I've been playing, actually, strangely enough, well, Overlord have been playing,

13:07.760 --> 13:10.640
and that game's still really fun.

13:10.640 --> 13:17.280
I've also been playing, this is going to be really weird, Cellars of Catan, actually.

13:17.280 --> 13:23.160
And because I got hooked on this yesterday, actually, I was playing the actual board game

13:23.160 --> 13:26.720
with my sister and her boyfriend, and it's really fun.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.320
So I bought the Xbox Live Arcade game, and it's pretty much the same thing, except the

13:30.320 --> 13:35.440
AI's completely cheap, but other than that, the only thing I really wish it had was local

13:35.440 --> 13:38.640
multiplayer instead of just over live.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.440
That would be pretty cool, but, you know, they didn't, so.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.400
But this game has passed the wife test, right?

13:43.400 --> 13:46.400
Oh yeah, the wife is probably playing it right now, actually.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.400
That's amazing.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.520
Yeah, she was playing it all afternoon, so.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.440
Does she have her own gamertag?

13:51.440 --> 13:54.720
So like, you could use my Xbox 360 over here and then play your wife.

13:54.720 --> 13:59.440
No, she's still playing, she's playing under my gamertag right now, so.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.840
Yeah, I think that's pretty much all I've been playing, you know, Grand Theft Auto by

14:02.840 --> 14:08.560
City Stories, of course, and still very disappointed about Grand Theft Auto IV not coming out until

14:08.560 --> 14:09.560
next year.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.560
Grand Theft Auto IV still played the PSP version for a long time.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.560
Cry me a river.

14:12.560 --> 14:13.560
Cry me a river.

14:13.560 --> 14:17.840
Alright, somebody in chat earlier, and I apologize, I forgot who said it, somebody had said, what's

14:17.840 --> 14:21.880
more funny than watching Grand Theft Auto IV get delayed is watching everything else

14:21.880 --> 14:25.700
back out of its way now that it's been delayed, everything else is getting delayed because

14:25.700 --> 14:26.700
of that.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.280
There's other games that have all kind of moved out of, like the ripple effect that

14:29.280 --> 14:30.840
Grand Theft Auto is having.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.720
Kind of interesting.

14:32.720 --> 14:37.800
Looking at the chat room and talking about some quotes there.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.520
What is it that Rob D. said that was really funny?

14:39.520 --> 14:43.800
Oh, about the Battle Coliseum game and how I said Mai could fight one of the King of

14:43.800 --> 14:44.800
the Monsters.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.940
Sky just wants to see Mai versus a tentacle monster, let's face it, that quote coming

14:48.940 --> 14:54.960
from the Rob D. Let's see, apparently the Rob D. didn't see 300 either, so I guess I'm

14:54.960 --> 14:56.720
not the only one ever.

14:56.720 --> 15:01.680
Let's see, what else is there?

15:01.680 --> 15:06.200
Ross Deal UT impersonates Loki, duh, I'm going to play this movie game, maybe it'll suck

15:06.200 --> 15:08.680
less than all the others.

15:08.680 --> 15:12.480
I suppose saying that all movie games usually suck.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.480
One thing that's usually a pretty common thing.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.200
For the most part they do, I mean there's some movie games that are okay.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.680
I remember like some of the NES Batman games weren't that bad.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.080
Oh yeah, that's true.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.980
And I actually liked the Friday the 13th game.

15:25.980 --> 15:30.240
It always ends up on these worst NES games of all times list, but that game actually

15:30.240 --> 15:34.120
scared me when I was a kid, because it was kind of a scary game, I don't know, anyway.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.160
But yeah, movie games usually not so much fun.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.760
Let's see, games I've been playing this week.

15:39.760 --> 15:42.880
Not a lot of new stuff unfortunately, I've been on World of Warcraft, I'm really grinding

15:42.880 --> 15:46.200
like hell in World of Warcraft to try and get my character to level 70, so I'll be all

15:46.200 --> 15:51.200
ready by the time the next expansion comes out, and also the fact is that I know all

15:51.200 --> 15:54.160
these console games are coming out very soon, like especially when we get into the end of

15:54.160 --> 15:59.840
August, Blue Dragon, Eternal Sonata, Halo, and then Metro Prime 3 and all these games

15:59.840 --> 16:03.220
I'm going to want to be playing are all coming out soon, so I want to get as much grinding

16:03.220 --> 16:06.220
in as I can before I get distracted by the console games.

16:06.220 --> 16:10.040
So most of my week has been spent on the PC playing WoW, otherwise though I have been

16:10.040 --> 16:15.240
playing some other console games, I was playing Kingdom Hearts 2 more, and I finally surpassed

16:15.240 --> 16:17.920
my first save game, so I guess that's kind of cool.

16:17.920 --> 16:23.040
Otherwise I checked out, because I was without internet for a little while, because if you

16:23.040 --> 16:26.800
listen to last week's show, Comcast finally didn't come out here until Tuesday, and by

16:26.800 --> 16:30.720
the way, let me say, Comcast said they were going to come in here in a window between

16:30.720 --> 16:33.160
12 and 4, you know what time they finally got here?

16:33.160 --> 16:36.200
7.30, 8 o'clock, it's horrible.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.480
Then I would, don't you get some money or something off your bill?

16:39.480 --> 16:41.480
We got a $20 credit.

16:41.480 --> 16:42.480
Whoopee!

16:42.480 --> 16:43.480
Whoopee-doo!

16:43.480 --> 16:44.480
Whoopee-doo!

16:44.480 --> 16:47.880
Then they installed all this shit we didn't ask for, like all the HBO and Showtime shit,

16:47.880 --> 16:49.360
and channels, we didn't want that shit.

16:49.360 --> 16:52.400
I mean it was cool for one night, because I got to watch Big Brother After Dark, which

16:52.400 --> 16:56.500
is kind of cheesy fun, but yeah, we had to get rid of that, like they just totally screwed

16:56.500 --> 16:57.500
up the order.

16:57.500 --> 17:02.280
I'm actually surprised they remembered to put the HD in there, it's bad.

17:02.280 --> 17:06.440
So yeah, otherwise my gaming week has been pretty light in that regard, just mostly World

17:06.440 --> 17:11.720
of Warcraft, but I will be kicking back into high gear when we get into the end of the

17:11.720 --> 17:12.720
month.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.680
Oh, the Xbox Live Arcade games, I did catch up on all those ones I missed while I was

17:15.680 --> 17:16.680
out.

17:16.680 --> 17:17.880
I didn't care for any of them.

17:17.880 --> 17:22.360
Like I just, I played like four, I didn't like the Spyglass board games, I didn't like

17:22.360 --> 17:28.080
Super, well Super Contra was okay, I mean, you know, and Track and Field is okay, surprisingly,

17:28.080 --> 17:30.400
I actually think I played Track and Field more than any of the other ones.

17:30.400 --> 17:34.760
I was thinking about buying Track and Field, it just looks stupid, like it's just back

17:34.760 --> 17:38.000
and forth with the analog sick, isn't it?

17:38.000 --> 17:42.360
Well that, or you can use the buttons, because the actual arcade machine used buttons, like

17:42.360 --> 17:43.640
giant pop and music.

17:43.640 --> 17:47.600
Or you know what I suggest doing, since I think, aren't the controls completely configurable

17:47.600 --> 17:49.000
and stuff like that?

17:49.000 --> 17:54.400
DDR pads, man, get out the DDR pads and bust it out like Track and Field, yeah.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
Maybe.

17:55.400 --> 17:59.040
I don't know, it's not the most thrilling game ever, but for some reason I like those

17:59.040 --> 18:02.560
old retro games, so it's fun to me.

18:02.560 --> 18:05.520
But I don't know if I'd actually recommend it to a lot of people, because it's certainly

18:05.520 --> 18:09.880
not one of the better Konami arcade ports that's on Marketplace.

18:09.880 --> 18:15.240
Anyway, let's move on and get into some housekeeping so we can get to tonight's news.

18:15.240 --> 18:18.840
First off in the housekeeping tonight, podcast award voting is closed, so you can no longer

18:18.840 --> 18:22.960
vote for us, but we appreciate anybody that voted for us, we won't know the results till

18:22.960 --> 18:28.440
later and, I don't know, we probably won't win, and it's okay if we don't, you know,

18:28.440 --> 18:29.440
whatever.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.440
It was nice to be nominated.

18:30.440 --> 18:31.440
Exactly.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.120
Because especially after last year when we weren't nominated, we were like, did we do

18:33.120 --> 18:34.120
something wrong?

18:34.120 --> 18:36.120
But it was cool, so.

18:36.120 --> 18:39.280
Why don't they call us in the morning?

18:39.280 --> 18:41.840
Why don't you call me anymore?

18:41.840 --> 18:45.280
But yeah, they nominated like ten shows this year, which is great, but that's a lot of

18:45.280 --> 18:48.560
competition, so I wouldn't expect that we win, but if we do, awesome.

18:48.560 --> 18:53.200
But moving on, we are featured on Joystiq's podcast rodeo this week, which was kind of

18:53.200 --> 18:58.060
hilarious because, you know, we've been doing this show for, you know, years and years,

18:58.060 --> 19:03.500
and they highlighted us this week as kind of like, they were mentioning all the podcasts

19:03.500 --> 19:07.240
they had that week, and they had themselves, because Joystiq does their own podcast, but

19:07.240 --> 19:10.960
they're a little bit irregular, but I guess they did two weeks in a row, so they were

19:10.960 --> 19:14.400
nominating themselves for having done two weeks in a row, like saying hooray for us,

19:14.400 --> 19:17.520
and then they followed up with us and saying, well, now we have these guys who've been doing

19:17.520 --> 19:18.520
it for years and years.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.840
So that was just kind of funny.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.480
So we appreciate the plug, but it's hilarious that it happened the week that our show was

19:23.480 --> 19:27.380
like totally broken, and like Jamie wasn't even here, and then we had all the sound issues

19:27.380 --> 19:28.380
we had last week.

19:28.380 --> 19:29.380
It was just nuts.

19:29.380 --> 19:33.900
And what the listeners couldn't see last week is I was also trying to read stories while

19:33.900 --> 19:38.040
keeping the spaghetti away from my cat, because I had a plate of spaghetti, and she kept trying

19:38.040 --> 19:39.800
to attack the plate.

19:39.800 --> 19:44.560
The sound was so horrible last week, and then for some reason, there was like little packet

19:44.560 --> 19:50.200
losses throughout the file, so like suddenly you'd be, and then the words would drop out.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.200
It was bad.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.600
Because my computer sucks.

19:52.600 --> 19:57.440
Luckily, it didn't just reset on us all of a sudden, because it's been doing that lately.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.760
I have to replace the motherboard, something's going out on it, so.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.840
It was better than nothing at all, though, right?

20:02.840 --> 20:08.680
It's an old PC, it needs to be upgraded anyway, so, no, we'll not get an iMac.

20:08.680 --> 20:12.480
We went to the Apple store yesterday, oh my God, I felt, I almost felt like I was going

20:12.480 --> 20:16.880
to burst into flames, you know.

20:16.880 --> 20:20.840
You know, we almost had a webcam tonight, but I just didn't get it set up in time.

20:20.840 --> 20:25.160
But you, speaking of Apple, my little Apple webcam and the laptop, so I can have it wherever,

20:25.160 --> 20:27.720
but we're going to wait until we move out to the garage to do that, so it'll be fun.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.000
You know who else likes that seller is a catan?

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
What's that?

20:31.000 --> 20:35.960
She'll sit there in front of the TV and watch the dice move and the cards move and stuff.

20:35.960 --> 20:38.040
Just completely fascinated by it.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.040
It's awesome.

20:39.040 --> 20:43.380
Alright, let's get into some gaming news for tonight, so we can make fun of what's going

20:43.380 --> 20:44.600
on in the gaming industry right now.

20:44.600 --> 20:48.520
We're not going to make fun, we're going to talk about it in intelligent discussion.

20:48.520 --> 20:49.520
Sure.

20:49.520 --> 20:55.080
Okay, so there's a rumor going around that Target, among other stores, are going to be

20:55.080 --> 20:58.880
discontinuing the Xbox 360 core model.

20:58.880 --> 21:05.380
Now, as I mentioned in the last week, I kind of theorized that this might be happening,

21:05.380 --> 21:08.560
although I don't think it's any time soon that it's going to happen.

21:08.560 --> 21:12.680
But the theory behind it is, other than the fact that it is showing discontinuity in their

21:12.680 --> 21:18.720
system, is that they're replacing all of the current premium systems out there with the

21:18.720 --> 21:22.480
ones with HDMI, but they're not doing that with the core system.

21:22.480 --> 21:26.280
So people are thinking, okay, well they're going to just sell out the core system and

21:26.280 --> 21:28.400
then discontinue it.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.580
I don't know.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.180
Did Microsoft maybe do something to Target?

21:33.180 --> 21:36.520
Because I noticed Target, also, aren't they phasing out HD DVDs?

21:36.520 --> 21:38.200
Like I seem to remember that was a previous report.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.640
I think it was Target that was doing that.

21:39.640 --> 21:43.720
Well, they're phasing them out of their store, but if you've ever gone into Target looking

21:43.720 --> 21:50.280
for HD product anyways, their shelving that they have is literally maybe 12 movies that

21:50.280 --> 21:51.280
they have there.

21:51.280 --> 21:52.960
Blu-ray and HD DVD combined.

21:52.960 --> 21:58.720
Yeah, I wouldn't exactly consider Target my number one stop for HD DVD purchasing.

21:58.720 --> 21:59.720
It's only in store.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.000
I think they have them still on the website.

22:01.000 --> 22:06.280
It's a little disheartening, though, to see HD DVDs be phased out when I spent as much

22:06.280 --> 22:09.320
money as I did on the HD player for the 360.

22:09.320 --> 22:11.320
It's all numbers.

22:11.320 --> 22:17.240
If their Blu-ray product is selling and their HD is not, then it's better for them to stock

22:17.240 --> 22:20.500
more Blu-ray product than HD.

22:20.500 --> 22:24.240
Of course, then again, my purchase will be completely justified once Heroes season one

22:24.240 --> 22:26.160
comes out on HD DVD, so I don't mind.

22:26.160 --> 22:29.280
Because that's when I finally bought the HD DVD player when I heard Heroes was coming

22:29.280 --> 22:30.280
out on HD DVD.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.280
I was like, oh, gotta have it.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.280
So, we'll see.

22:32.280 --> 22:36.040
And then, hopefully, with season two or something, they'll do it where you can download the episodes

22:36.040 --> 22:37.220
right after they air.

22:37.220 --> 22:39.040
That would be awesome.

22:39.040 --> 22:45.240
Well, Target isn't the only place that's phasing out the Xbox 360 core model according to some

22:45.240 --> 22:46.840
rumors out there right now.

22:46.840 --> 22:50.720
And the other store that is phasing them out, Best Buy.

22:50.720 --> 22:54.680
Best Buy, as apparently a little screenshot has come out of their system, has shown that

22:54.680 --> 23:02.040
the status of the Xbox 360 core hardware in their system was deleted on July 29, 2007.

23:02.040 --> 23:08.720
So Microsoft denies that there's any type of core production being stocked.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.480
Microsoft says nothing has really changed since the way things were a couple weeks ago,

23:12.480 --> 23:15.960
but it's very interesting that now two stores in a row have kind of come out saying they're

23:15.960 --> 23:17.240
not going to do these cores anymore.

23:17.240 --> 23:23.600
Well, if you remember with the 28 system, and this also could be a numbers thing, before

23:23.600 --> 23:29.200
with the 28 system, stores were just not carrying them because people weren't buying them.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.040
So now, maybe people aren't really buying the core model anymore and they want to save

23:34.040 --> 23:38.780
inventory space or make room on the shelves for more premium systems, more elites and

23:38.780 --> 23:39.780
stuff like that.

23:39.780 --> 23:44.480
And then eventually, if this catches on widespread, then they'll eventually get rid of the core

23:44.480 --> 23:46.000
model altogether.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.440
Or it actually is something coming from Microsoft saying, hey, we're getting rid of the core

23:49.440 --> 23:51.120
model.

23:51.120 --> 23:56.400
I don't think that's actually been announced yet, so if that is going to happen, it probably

23:56.400 --> 23:58.360
won't happen until after Christmas.

23:58.360 --> 24:01.800
Wow, lots and lots of comments from chat on this one.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.680
DJ Dark Knight says Sears has never had the core models.

24:04.680 --> 24:07.800
Of course, I don't know a lot of people that do their gaming purchases at Sears, but I

24:07.800 --> 24:10.400
suppose somebody must because they're in the gaming business.

24:10.400 --> 24:14.920
My thought was always that they should, now that they're dropping the price of the system

24:14.920 --> 24:19.760
or something, just include the 64 meg memory unit with it.

24:19.760 --> 24:24.000
Then the people can say, okay, well I can buy this system and have something to save

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
on.

24:25.000 --> 24:29.800
Raven's Dolphin says, when Walmart says no more cores 360s, then it's done.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.280
Ross Steel UT says, of course Microsoft would deny.

24:32.280 --> 24:36.400
They probably also denied that the core only counts for maybe 20% of their sales.

24:36.400 --> 24:39.400
Bandit says they should keep the core for people who want to upgrade their memory later

24:39.400 --> 24:40.400
on.

24:40.400 --> 24:41.400
It'll be more accessible to everyone.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.560
I don't think they were going to announce the HDMI thing either until it leaked out,

24:44.560 --> 24:47.100
so I don't know.

24:47.100 --> 24:49.400

24:53.120 --> 24:58.720
By the way, some other chatters following up on the whole Target, HD DVD thing, GS191

24:58.720 --> 25:01.880
says this, Target is not getting rid of HD DVD.

25:01.880 --> 25:06.220
The Blu-ray camp just inked a deal for their product to be displayed more through the end

25:06.220 --> 25:07.220
of the year.

25:07.220 --> 25:12.640
I think Harold follows that up with a web link that says that's true, so very interesting.

25:12.640 --> 25:23.280
Honestly, myself, being that I've got a Blu-ray player, then...

25:23.280 --> 25:24.920
You don't have an HD DVD player, right?

25:24.920 --> 25:25.920
Nope.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.120
That's one of the things you don't have in your house, amazingly enough.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.120
One of them.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.120
Amongst all the other crap you have.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.080
You don't have an HD DVD player, though.

25:32.080 --> 25:35.240
No, I actually know more people who have Blu-ray players myself.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.040
Well, because they're built into the PlayStation 3s.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.720
You don't own PlayStation 3s.

25:38.720 --> 25:39.720
Really?

25:39.720 --> 25:44.640
This new Vio actually comes built in with Blu-ray for the players.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.960
See, Sony just used...

25:45.960 --> 25:48.920
I mean, if HD DVD loses, then it loses.

25:48.920 --> 25:51.280
Fine, I went with the wrong format, but...

25:51.280 --> 25:52.280
I'm surprised.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.360
Sony is really pushing with all their...

25:54.360 --> 25:56.480
Because, you know, Sony is not just a gaming company.

25:56.480 --> 26:00.980
They are an electronics company and a major one at that, so they've been able to sneak

26:00.980 --> 26:05.400
Blu-ray into all these other little places, and it's worked for them, where, for whatever

26:05.400 --> 26:07.120
reason, beta didn't.

26:07.120 --> 26:11.560
Well, there is still some hope, though, for people who...

26:11.560 --> 26:19.280
Well, I guess it's not specifically HD-related, but they are dropping the price of the Xbox

26:19.280 --> 26:21.720
360.

26:21.720 --> 26:26.960
It actually said that it was scheduled to happen on August 8th, so the price reduction

26:26.960 --> 26:29.880
should already be in place.

26:29.880 --> 26:38.840
So we are seeing the Elite model go to $449, the Pro model to $349, and the Core at $279.

26:38.840 --> 26:45.960
So of course, the premium had the biggest drop, given that that's the best seller.

26:45.960 --> 26:50.600
And that price drop was totally a surprise to me.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.400
And everybody out there on the internet.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.640
Yes, the entire internet was shocked and awed at that price drop.

26:55.640 --> 26:56.640
I'm actually curious, though...

26:56.640 --> 26:59.880
Well, I guess I don't think we have any stories on this tonight, so I can say that...

26:59.880 --> 27:04.200
I think I want to say I read somewhere that Amazon, the sales of the Xbox 360 went through

27:04.200 --> 27:06.360
the roof after the price drop.

27:06.360 --> 27:10.200
So I'm just kind of curious if the same thing happened at the retail outlets or what happened.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.720
Are you surprised they made the move at this time?

27:13.720 --> 27:16.480
Because I'm actually kind of a little surprised they didn't wait until a little closer to

27:16.480 --> 27:17.480
Christmas.

27:17.480 --> 27:20.800
Like, I would have expected the price drop a little more October-ish.

27:20.800 --> 27:24.760
But maybe then again with Halo 3 coming out when it is, maybe they wanted to do it in

27:24.760 --> 27:27.880
advance of Halo 3, which would certainly make sense.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.880
So who knows?

27:29.880 --> 27:33.520
I was just going to mention, there was another story I remember reading, I guess, that the

27:33.520 --> 27:41.680
NPD group did a survey with people asking them whether they're aware of different features

27:41.680 --> 27:42.680
of their console.

27:42.680 --> 27:47.060
And I guess almost 60% of people didn't realize that the Playstation 3 had a Blu-ray player

27:47.060 --> 27:52.080
in it, or had never used it for Blu-ray movies, which I thought that was a little bit funny.

27:52.080 --> 27:55.840
Anywho, what I want to know is what are they using it for then?

27:55.840 --> 27:56.840
Motorstorm?

27:56.840 --> 27:59.720
Is that the basketball game that's on it?

27:59.720 --> 28:00.720
Is that it?

28:00.720 --> 28:02.640
It must be all that wonderful download content that's online.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.640
Oh wait, no.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.640
That's right.

28:04.640 --> 28:08.800
Anyways, other countries are also getting a 360 price drop.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.800
In fact, Canadians are seeing a pretty big price drop.

28:11.800 --> 28:18.560
They will see a $100, of course that's in Canadian money, drop on the premium and core

28:18.560 --> 28:19.560
systems.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.160
So that's pretty awesome.

28:21.160 --> 28:28.720
And yeah, so after that price drop, the premium will be running, I guess, approximately $378

28:28.720 --> 28:29.720
US.

28:29.720 --> 28:35.200
Still, of course, with the exchange rates, they pay more.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.420
But for them, hey, $100 is cheaper.

28:37.420 --> 28:38.420
That's pretty awesome.

28:38.420 --> 28:41.360
I was going to say, usually with the exchange rates, the Canadians are paying a little bit

28:41.360 --> 28:44.720
more for their gaming than we are, but it's certainly not the jump that you see from going

28:44.720 --> 28:46.820
overseas to here.

28:46.820 --> 28:48.680
So yeah, kind of interesting.

28:48.680 --> 28:53.000
Well one thing that you can use your brand new Xbox 360 for if you decided to buy one

28:53.000 --> 28:57.040
with the price cut is the firmware update that went out this week.

28:57.040 --> 29:01.600
Unfortunately the firmware update wasn't really that exciting, it was just a small little

29:01.600 --> 29:02.600
update.

29:02.600 --> 29:06.600
And according to Major Nelson's blog, really the only thing that it was doing is preparing

29:06.600 --> 29:12.960
the Xbox 360 to use wireless guitar controllers for you Guitar Hero 3 players, and if any

29:12.960 --> 29:16.080
eventually come out for Rock Band and all that good stuff.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.300
So there really isn't a whole lot else to that firmware update.

29:19.300 --> 29:23.040
You know, it's kind of a bummer too because when you turn on your Xbox 360 and you see

29:23.040 --> 29:26.600
ooh, a new firmware update is available, you kind of start to get a little bit excited

29:26.600 --> 29:30.320
like ooh, I wonder what new features they've added this week, or what they're adding, or

29:30.320 --> 29:35.120
is this the big seasonal update because they do a big one in fall and I think spring, of

29:35.120 --> 29:38.000
course it's summer, so that wouldn't make sense for my brain to go there.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.440
But you can still help but get a little bit excited when the thing comes up and says there's

29:41.440 --> 29:44.320
a firmware update, like ooh, what cool new feature are they going to add, and then turns

29:44.320 --> 29:46.320
out to be nothing.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.320
Oh well.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.320
That's poo.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.320
Oh well, I mean.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.320
That's big stinky poop.

29:50.320 --> 29:54.640
It was unexpected so it's, you know, can't really beg for a lot with that.

29:54.640 --> 30:00.520
For anybody who is actually excited about anything having to do with Halo, well Halo

30:00.520 --> 30:08.480
3 I should say, or likes having green Xbox 360s, the Halo themed Xbox 360 will be out

30:08.480 --> 30:18.440
in September, priced for $399 with a wireless headset for $59.99.

30:18.440 --> 30:22.640
I don't really see anything all that special about it, it says it's spartan green and gold,

30:22.640 --> 30:30.100
really it looks to me like it's baby poop green with orange, at least that's what it

30:30.100 --> 30:32.780
looks like, so.

30:32.780 --> 30:37.840
As far as your HDMI cables, that comes separately.

30:37.840 --> 30:40.560
That's exactly how they should market it too.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.560
It's the new baby poop green.

30:41.560 --> 30:42.560
You have an HDMI port.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.200
Well they all have the HDMI port now.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.720
But no cable.

30:46.720 --> 30:50.040
Really the only thing that you get for the extra $50 is you get a plain charge kit that's

30:50.040 --> 30:56.440
also the, I guess, baby poop green, and you get, you know, the wonderful baby poop green

30:56.440 --> 30:57.440
paint job.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.520
It does look like baby poop, it's that type of green.

31:00.520 --> 31:05.600
If you do want HDMI cables, those will cost you about $50 and they're going to be sold

31:05.600 --> 31:10.820
separately actually now that all the 360s with the premiums with the HDMI are coming

31:10.820 --> 31:12.600
out.

31:12.600 --> 31:18.220
So yay, you get the, and there's no even, there's no Halo 3 with it even, which is kind

31:18.220 --> 31:21.140
of come on, I mean, why didn't they do that?

31:21.140 --> 31:24.760
Because you know there's people that are going to go out and buy their Xbox 360 the day that

31:24.760 --> 31:26.160
Halo 3 comes out.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.840
They're going to finally make that upgrade because they've been playing Halo 2 this whole

31:28.840 --> 31:29.840
time.

31:29.840 --> 31:37.000
Oh my god, there are also two custom Halo 3 controllers there, one for the Covenant,

31:37.000 --> 31:41.960
one for Spartans that are done by Todd McFarlane with collectible figurines, those are also

31:41.960 --> 31:47.280
coming out, as well as skins, I'm sure, by Mad Catz and other companies, as well as useless

31:47.280 --> 31:52.040
shit like an ammo case that holds controllers and crap from other companies.

31:52.040 --> 31:56.280
People, I mean, really if you want Halo 3 and you're that big of a Halo nut, then you're

31:56.280 --> 31:59.840
going to be a sucker and buy all this shit, and if not, you're not really that big of

31:59.840 --> 32:01.560
a fan.

32:01.560 --> 32:07.120
Son of Dad in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com calls the new color, Split P in Halo chunky

32:07.120 --> 32:13.800
style Xbox 360, delicious, mmm, yummy.

32:13.800 --> 32:20.960
Well anyways, speaking of Halo 3, apparently there are a lot of fans out there, who knew,

32:20.960 --> 32:28.200
and Halo 3 has become the fastest selling pre-ordered game in history.

32:28.200 --> 32:32.860
Apparently one million pre-orders have been taken in North America, a new record apparently

32:32.860 --> 32:35.400
for those keeping track.

32:35.400 --> 32:41.040
And also, you know, this all kind of ties in with their marketing campaign, including

32:41.040 --> 32:46.120
7-Eleven, Burger King, Comcast, Mountain Dew, and Pontiac.

32:46.120 --> 32:51.040
Honestly, Pontiac, how the fuck does that relate to Halo?

32:51.040 --> 32:55.200
I can understand the 7-Eleven, because you know, you have that Halo Mountain Dew crap

32:55.200 --> 32:59.000
and stuff that you can sell that, alright, and then maybe Burger King, because it's on

32:59.000 --> 33:04.580
their cups and shit, maybe there's some kid's toys or something, but Pontiac, come on, there's

33:04.580 --> 33:05.580
nothing to, seriously.

33:05.580 --> 33:08.440
Were you going to hop on the bandwagon?

33:08.440 --> 33:10.920
Are you really that hard up in selling your cars?

33:10.920 --> 33:13.920
Maybe they're going to make tags.

33:13.920 --> 33:16.720
I think that's pretty funny.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.800
Maybe Pontiac's getting into the war car building business.

33:19.800 --> 33:23.760
But really, would you want a war car made by Pontiac?

33:23.760 --> 33:29.400
I mean, that's just like, that's just like, you know, this is my Volkswagen killing machine.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.040
I mean, it's just, it's crap.

33:31.040 --> 33:36.600
No, no, no, because remember Volkswagen wouldn't lend their likenesses for that kind of thing.

33:36.600 --> 33:41.000
You know, I'd buy the Volkswagen one before I'd buy a Ford one, that's for sure, found

33:41.000 --> 33:43.440
on road debt.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.400
And I fix off and repair daily.

33:45.400 --> 33:49.240
I hope they release like a Covenant car and a Spartan car, then they can have the fucking

33:49.240 --> 33:50.240
Halo fans.

33:50.240 --> 33:54.880
I'm going to fucking kill you in my Spartan car, yeah that's right, it's better than your

33:54.880 --> 33:55.880
Covenant car.

33:55.880 --> 33:58.480
Actually, I'm driving a Pontiac, you're both losers.

33:58.480 --> 34:01.960
I'd buy a Pontiac if they put guns in the front of it, so I can shoot people who get

34:01.960 --> 34:02.960
in my way.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.960
I mean, come on.

34:04.960 --> 34:05.960
Alright, maybe not.

34:05.960 --> 34:10.760
But I wanted to say about this, how is Halo 3 tied into the Comcast thing, because they're

34:10.760 --> 34:14.960
going to have a little... we didn't get a baby shit green cable box.

34:14.960 --> 34:19.240
Here's why, they're going to have videos on their Comcast on demand service, the service

34:19.240 --> 34:23.440
that I never use, ever, they're going to have that on there.

34:23.440 --> 34:24.440
Hooray!

34:24.440 --> 34:26.040
Are they even going to bother and do it in HD?

34:26.040 --> 34:30.720
I guess this justifies them raising the rates on their cable, you know, oh thank you, I

34:30.720 --> 34:38.760
get Halo exclusive content, and you're raising my rates and they're $5, thank you Comcast!

34:38.760 --> 34:45.560
Oh, I could have just imagined my roommate's reaction if, you know, because it was bad

34:45.560 --> 34:49.560
enough when they only offered him the $20 discount for wasting his whole day, and then

34:49.560 --> 34:54.200
like fucking up his total order, I could just imagine if the thing had been, you know, oh

34:54.200 --> 34:59.400
well, we're really sorry about the inconvenience, here's some free Halo 3 trailers!

34:59.400 --> 35:00.400
Yay!

35:00.400 --> 35:01.400
Ah!

35:01.400 --> 35:03.960
Joy plus Rapture equals no.

35:03.960 --> 35:04.960
Wow.

35:04.960 --> 35:05.960
Interesting.

35:05.960 --> 35:11.280
Yeah, I'm not surprised about the whole pre-order record-breaking thing, because like what you

35:11.280 --> 35:14.480
said, the whole 7-Eleven tie-ins, like we talked about last week, how you can pre-order

35:14.480 --> 35:17.520
Halo 3 at 7-Eleven now, it's crazy.

35:17.520 --> 35:21.960
And then just the fact that, you know, many, many stores whore their pre-orderings now,

35:21.960 --> 35:25.960
they've all taken a page from GameStop, and of course GameStop's still king of their game

35:25.960 --> 35:28.320
every time somebody comes in, did you want to reserve Halo 3?

35:28.320 --> 35:29.480
Did you want to reserve Halo 3?

35:29.480 --> 35:33.920
Oh, I see you're buying Bratz for the DS, did you want to reserve Halo 3?

35:33.920 --> 35:37.200
It's like, hey, you want to buy Madden from us?

35:37.200 --> 35:38.200
We'll give you a free mini-poster.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.880
No!

35:40.880 --> 35:41.880
I don't like Madden.

35:41.880 --> 35:42.880
How about Halo 3?

35:42.880 --> 35:43.880
Now fuck off!

35:43.880 --> 35:48.280
I'm sorry, I've been hearing about nothing but Madden lately.

35:48.280 --> 35:51.440
You just bought Halo 3, do you want to pre-order Halo 3?

35:51.440 --> 35:57.840
Every time I call Dan's store, it's like, blah blah blah blah blah reserve Madden, no!

35:57.840 --> 36:02.400
I can imagine walking into GameStop, yes, I'm here to reserve Halo 3.

36:02.400 --> 36:03.400
Oh, great!

36:03.400 --> 36:05.840
Would you like to reserve Halo 4 while you're at it?

36:05.840 --> 36:11.920
I mean, if anyone, if they should have partnered up with a car dealership, or a car company,

36:11.920 --> 36:15.880
it should have been like the fucking Hummer, because at least that's the size of the Warthog,

36:15.880 --> 36:16.880
okay?

36:16.880 --> 36:17.880
Humvee.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.720
Humvee, whatever.

36:20.720 --> 36:28.140
The other thing I'm kind of curious about with all this is, oh, I know what I wanted

36:28.140 --> 36:31.080
to say earlier that I couldn't think of.

36:31.080 --> 36:36.240
I think one of the worst trends in retail across the board that I've seen now is fake

36:36.240 --> 36:39.840
boxes to try to get you to pre-order the game.

36:39.840 --> 36:43.200
You'll be walking down Best Buy and go, oh, I didn't know this game was out, and you reach

36:43.200 --> 36:47.160
for it and you grab it, and then it's like, oh, a little sticker, pre-order, I know, and

36:47.160 --> 36:49.800
it's a horrible, horrible trick that I always fall for.

36:49.800 --> 36:54.560
Last summer, they had Madden 08 already in GameStop, I kid you not, they made up their

36:54.560 --> 36:58.840
own box art so you can pre-order Madden 08, and this was literally weeks after Madden

36:58.840 --> 37:04.000
07 came out, I mean, come on, seriously.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.120
Tiger Claw says, Sky, I went to GameStop on Saturday and one of the employees, for some

37:08.120 --> 37:12.280
bizarre reason, was wearing a cardboard box over his head.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.400
Did it say pre-order Halo 3 on the top, maybe?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.680
I don't know.

37:15.680 --> 37:20.380
And the other thing, do we really need press releases that go out when your game's put

37:20.380 --> 37:21.380
out?

37:21.380 --> 37:26.560
It's the fastest selling game ever until the next game comes out and then it'll sell more.

37:26.560 --> 37:30.960
I didn't even realize that there was a specific date when they started taking Halo 3 pre-orders,

37:30.960 --> 37:36.680
I thought we'd been booking Halo 3 since, you know, everyone knew Halo 3 was in existence.

37:36.680 --> 37:40.640
Alright, anyhow, let's move on off the Halo 3 talk, because there's plenty of other things

37:40.640 --> 37:45.980
on the Xbox 360 people are looking forward to, including the next round of Xbox Live

37:45.980 --> 37:51.160
Arcade games, and there's a lot of games slated to be coming out over the next couple months,

37:51.160 --> 38:00.000
including the much anticipated Hexic 2, also Echo the Dolphin, WarWorld, Geon Emotions,

38:00.000 --> 38:06.880
Puzzle Quest, Space Giraffe, Streets of Rage 2, and of course Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo

38:06.880 --> 38:09.920
HD Remix.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.840
But I'm actually very much looking forward to that game.

38:11.840 --> 38:17.160
Apparently they've done some balancing, they've changed a little bit the drops, like you know

38:17.160 --> 38:21.720
how, for instance, Chun Li's drop pattern kind of sucked, like you know, because it

38:21.720 --> 38:24.760
basically created power gems if you dropped a bunch on your opponent?

38:24.760 --> 38:26.360
That's why you always use Donovan.

38:26.360 --> 38:31.840
Well now, well they've changed some things so that like Chun Li now drops 120% more blocks,

38:31.840 --> 38:35.440
even though it's in the pattern, and they've scaled some other people back to 80% of their

38:35.440 --> 38:38.280
blocks, so to try and even out the way people play, so.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.300
Yay, more power gems!

38:40.300 --> 38:41.760
Could be interesting, I know.

38:41.760 --> 38:44.380
That's kind of what I thought when I read that, I'm like, so they want you to make more

38:44.380 --> 38:45.380
power gems?

38:45.380 --> 38:50.520
Okay, okay, Janami, you don't use Dan unless you think that you're like God's gift to Puzzle

38:50.520 --> 38:51.520
Fighter.

38:51.520 --> 38:55.040
Or if you want to have a really hilarious Dan vs. Dan match.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.680
Because he does nothing but drop red blocks.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.480
Exactly, that's awesome.

38:59.480 --> 39:04.920
Oh, the chat room is daring to correct me, Hitstun says, there's an X dash mode with

39:04.920 --> 39:08.240
the new drop patterns, but there's also the original X mode.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.820
My bad.

39:09.820 --> 39:11.920
I'm still looking forward to the release, no matter what.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.920
It'll be fun.

39:13.920 --> 39:18.120
You know, I bet I could take you on Puzzle Fighter, Rob.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.920
Well, we shall see in a couple weeks when the game comes out, won't we?

39:20.920 --> 39:21.920
Yes, we will.

39:21.920 --> 39:28.760
Well, speaking of other things that are coming out, though, well, rumored to come out, EGM

39:28.760 --> 39:37.200
reported Penny Arcade is going to be having a game that will be on Xbox Live Arcade.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.200
Possibly.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.200
Possibly.

39:39.200 --> 39:47.360
Um, we have a label of Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 1 on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness

39:47.360 --> 39:49.520
to be out in the fall.

39:49.520 --> 39:53.000
This one surprised me at all, because there's already Penny Arcade content on Xbox Live

39:53.000 --> 39:57.880
and has been for a long, long time, because you can get, like, themes and little, uh,

39:57.880 --> 39:59.800
clip arts, or the little game rickshirts and stuff.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.800
I hope it's amazing.

40:01.800 --> 40:07.440
I don't, if it's anything less than amazing, I'll be like, well, crap!

40:07.440 --> 40:09.080
I'll probably download it anyway.

40:09.080 --> 40:12.360
But it wouldn't surprise me at all if there ended up being a Penny Arcade game on the

40:12.360 --> 40:16.220
marketplace, because Microsoft's kind of liked that lately, is that they're really trying

40:16.220 --> 40:20.360
to get into those, you know, fan communities and the thing that the internet's all abuzz

40:20.360 --> 40:21.360
about.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.360
Microsoft wants a part of that, so.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.680
Well, there's nothing actually confirmed yet, so.

40:24.680 --> 40:27.180
All they'd have to do is throw money at them.

40:27.180 --> 40:29.440
Money is what moves the world.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.440
Exactly.

40:30.440 --> 40:31.440
Awesome.

40:31.440 --> 40:36.640
Well, anyways, um, we've got some good releases this week, and of course, unless you've been

40:36.640 --> 40:42.180
hiding under a rock, um, and even then, you might still know about this, Madden is coming

40:42.180 --> 40:48.240
out for everything, including the Coleco, Atari, okay, maybe I made that last part up.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.240
Cool!

40:49.240 --> 40:50.240
I want to get Madden on the Atari.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.240
I want it on the Turbo Duo!

40:51.240 --> 40:52.240
That's amazing.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.600
Have you seen the Simpsons game trailer?

40:53.600 --> 40:54.760
It actually has that.

40:54.760 --> 41:00.240
It says, coming out for all game systems, and it shows the Coleco, Atari, you know,

41:00.240 --> 41:03.440
like, Intellivision, Jaguar, that's awesome.

41:03.440 --> 41:06.160
Dude, they should put it out on those systems, that would be rad.

41:06.160 --> 41:11.520
So, no, that, it is coming out on most everything, I think, except for the Game Boy Advance.

41:11.520 --> 41:17.480
And then, also, if you're not into Madden, on PlayStation 2, Shin Megami Tensei Persona

41:17.480 --> 41:22.840
3 is coming out on PlayStation 2, and by the way, I brought my copy for you so you can

41:22.840 --> 41:24.840
try it out.

41:24.840 --> 41:25.840
Hooray!

41:25.840 --> 41:32.160
And then, let's see, Metropolis Mania 2, that's also coming out.

41:32.160 --> 41:38.680
Let's see, Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1, yay.

41:38.680 --> 41:47.600
On PSP, Dungeons and Dragons Tactics, Ghost Recon, oh, no, that's next week, sorry, sorry.

41:47.600 --> 41:56.120
Let's see, other than that, oh, DS, DS are some good stuff.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.280
Let's see, Luminous Ark, that's supposed to be pretty good.

41:58.280 --> 42:01.600
Rune Factory, a fantasy Harvest Moon.

42:01.600 --> 42:04.200
How many Harvest Moon games will come out this year?

42:04.200 --> 42:05.200
That's a good question.

42:05.200 --> 42:10.000
Heroes of Mana, that's supposed to be actually pretty good on DS.

42:10.000 --> 42:18.040
Operation Vietnam, and High School Musical, Makin' the Cut, and yeah, that's pretty much

42:18.040 --> 42:19.040
it.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.040
It's Madden or nothin'.

42:20.040 --> 42:29.840
Alright, well, I'm heading over to the Japanese release dates, and I'm here to tell you there's

42:29.840 --> 42:35.000
not a goddamn thing worth noting coming out in Japan this week, nothing, there's nothing,

42:35.000 --> 42:36.920
absolutely nothing coming out over there.

42:36.920 --> 42:40.920
However, if you happen to live in Korea, you're getting some of the same things we are.

42:40.920 --> 42:46.200
You're also getting Persona 3 on the PlayStation 2, but otherwise, it's a very slow week, nothing

42:46.200 --> 42:47.200
of note.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.800
I mean, I guess there's a couple small titles, but nothing worth mentioning, honestly, so

42:50.800 --> 42:51.800
slow week.

42:51.800 --> 42:56.120
Well, yeah, it's about the same, I'm over in the UK right now.

42:56.120 --> 43:00.480
Premiere Manager 08, and Two Worlds.

43:00.480 --> 43:01.480
Slow times.

43:01.480 --> 43:02.480
That's it.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.440
However, lucky people are getting Blue Dragon on the 24th.

43:05.440 --> 43:06.840
I think we are, too.

43:06.840 --> 43:07.840
Yep.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.920
So, hey, we get something at the same time, and they're getting Blazing Angels later,

43:11.920 --> 43:12.920
too.

43:12.920 --> 43:13.920
Very cool.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.240
You know, and this is just the calm before the storm right here.

43:16.240 --> 43:20.800
This August is always the slow period, so we're gonna start seeing things really pick

43:20.800 --> 43:26.080
up very soon here, like, you know, Blue Dragon, Metroid Prime 3, then we get in next month,

43:26.080 --> 43:27.320
and then, you know, the Halo, everything.

43:27.320 --> 43:28.320
It's gonna be a mess.

43:28.320 --> 43:33.920
There's a to-be announced on here for Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System.

43:33.920 --> 43:36.080
We need to get a date on that.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.920
I thought that already came out.

43:37.920 --> 43:38.920
It came out in Japan, yeah.

43:38.920 --> 43:41.280
That was last week's releases in Japan.

43:41.280 --> 43:44.520
It's sating pending for the UK, but nothing specific.

43:44.520 --> 43:45.520
Let me put out a press release.

43:45.520 --> 43:46.680
The issue would come out over here.

43:46.680 --> 43:50.480
Let me put out a press release saying that's the crappiest title for a game, or a Final

43:50.480 --> 43:53.000
Fantasy game.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.360
The Rob D. would like to say August ain't slow this year because you're getting a Bioshock,

43:56.360 --> 43:57.360
a Madden, everything.

43:57.360 --> 44:01.240
Yeah, I know, I know, but I'm saying, like, you know, that's all towards the end of the

44:01.240 --> 44:02.240
month.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.240
Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:03.240 --> 44:04.240
I wanna play Blue Dragon and Bioshock.

44:04.240 --> 44:07.560
Rob was talking about, well, not Blue Dragon, but I'm talking about the other stuff.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.560
No.

44:08.560 --> 44:09.560
Well, just because you guys are anti-Madden.

44:09.560 --> 44:12.400
It's still a slow month, even though those games are coming out.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.560
I mean, look at it, okay.

44:14.560 --> 44:22.680
So Bioshock, that's coming out next week, in the week of the 21st, and, well, that's

44:22.680 --> 44:23.680
it.

44:23.680 --> 44:24.680
I see.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.560
So basically you're saying the problem with this month is that you just have, like, these

44:26.560 --> 44:29.520
few A-list titles kind of tent-pulling us through the month.

44:29.520 --> 44:30.520
Pretty much.

44:30.520 --> 44:31.520
There's not a lot of other stuff.

44:31.520 --> 44:35.080
Bioshock's next week, and then the week after that, you've got the Blue Dragon, Metrory

44:35.080 --> 44:41.600
Prime 3, Stuntman Ignition, Tiger Woods 08, and stuff like that, but that's pretty much

44:41.600 --> 44:42.840
it for the rest of the month.

44:42.840 --> 44:48.920
September is crazy, and then beyond that, it's just, ugh, I don't even wanna know.

44:48.920 --> 44:49.920
I fear November.

44:49.920 --> 44:50.920
November's scary.

44:50.920 --> 44:55.320
I'm sorry, Blue Dragon's the only one out of that list that I'm having any problem looking

44:55.320 --> 44:56.320
forward to.

44:56.320 --> 44:57.320
December's getting scary, too.

44:57.320 --> 44:58.640
I'm not as looking forward to Metroid Prime 3 as you might think.

44:58.640 --> 45:03.120
I was very, very, very disappointed that Nintendo did not decide to go online multiplayer with

45:03.120 --> 45:04.120
it.

45:04.120 --> 45:06.120
We need a Metroid Metroid.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.120
Like old-school Metroid?

45:07.120 --> 45:08.120
Yes.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.120
Well, we get them on Virtual Console, if nothing else.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.120
No.

45:10.120 --> 45:11.120
Next week, I think.

45:11.120 --> 45:12.520
We need an actual new Metroid game.

45:12.520 --> 45:14.480
We need Metroid Wii.

45:14.480 --> 45:15.480
We'll see.

45:15.480 --> 45:16.480
Metroid Metroid.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.480
We love Metroid.

45:17.480 --> 45:18.480
But that's what we want.

45:18.480 --> 45:19.480
That's Metroid Prime 3.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.480
No.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.480
No.

45:21.480 --> 45:22.480
You want a 2D.

45:22.480 --> 45:23.480
You need to be specific.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.480
You want a 2D Metroid on the Wii.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.480
I want a 2D Metroid on the Wii.

45:25.480 --> 45:26.480
Alright.

45:26.480 --> 45:32.160
Or, or like a, um, like, you know how, um, the Sega Aegis Fantasy Zone is with the, uh,

45:32.160 --> 45:34.160
the, the 3D, 2D look?

45:34.160 --> 45:35.160
What?

45:35.160 --> 45:36.160
You need something like that.

45:36.160 --> 45:40.480
I don't know if you heard, but there's, uh, rumors going around saying that Castlevania

45:40.480 --> 45:46.280
Aria of Sorrow's gonna be, uh, shown at Let's Big, um, on the PC.

45:46.280 --> 45:50.160
And so, if it's on the PC, then it could ideally come to consoles.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.160
Interesting.

45:51.160 --> 45:52.960
And that was the Game Boy Advance one, so.

45:52.960 --> 45:54.720
We'll see.

45:54.720 --> 45:57.160
Let's go ahead and move on and get back into some news.

45:57.160 --> 46:02.760
Anyhoo, um, so we were talking a little bit earlier about firmware updates for the 360.

46:02.760 --> 46:07.440
Well, the Wii, you know, couldn't be left out, so they decided to update to version

46:07.440 --> 46:11.680
3, which you get some spiffy shit with that.

46:11.680 --> 46:17.320
Um, now, nothing major like the Check Me Out channel or anything like that, but, uh, you

46:17.320 --> 46:24.000
get a wonderful digital clock, hurrah, and, uh, the Forecast channel now displays the

46:24.000 --> 46:29.280
current condition, yet it doesn't display the temperature, and the current condition

46:29.280 --> 46:33.580
is still, like, I'll boot up my Wii at, like, 4 o'clock in the evening and it, it shows

46:33.580 --> 46:35.800
a picture of a moon.

46:35.800 --> 46:38.080
I'm like, look outside, you stupid Wii.

46:38.080 --> 46:40.760
They're just trying to let you know that the moon's still there, okay?

46:40.760 --> 46:41.760
Oh, good.

46:41.760 --> 46:42.760
I'm glad to hear it.

46:42.760 --> 46:43.760
Moon not destroyed yet.

46:43.760 --> 46:44.760
Thank God.

46:44.760 --> 46:45.760
Okay.

46:45.760 --> 46:46.760
Oh, hooray.

46:46.760 --> 46:52.040
This channel can now display two scrolling headlines at a time in the Wii menu.

46:52.040 --> 46:58.080
Um, then, uh, let's see, the message board now has, uh, today's accomplishments message

46:58.080 --> 47:02.880
as a white message, which will allow you to stand out, or allow it to stand out from other

47:02.880 --> 47:03.880
messages.

47:03.880 --> 47:07.160
I still hate those today's accomplishments things anyways.

47:07.160 --> 47:12.760
Uh, address book can now be shifted around using A and B. There's a calendar that no

47:12.760 --> 47:18.600
longer shows today's accomplishments, and scrolling messages in the Wii message board

47:18.600 --> 47:21.360
now use a different sound.

47:21.360 --> 47:24.640
I guess in the Wii shop channel, they've got some other stuff.

47:24.640 --> 47:29.800
You can search by category, publisher, genre, but you still can't look at videos within

47:29.800 --> 47:31.260
the Wii shop channel.

47:31.260 --> 47:33.520
You have to go onto the internet to see that.

47:33.520 --> 47:38.960
Um, and then, uh, of course, you know, there's some settings, I guess, warning added to pre-system

47:38.960 --> 47:45.360
update detailing that, uh, technically modified consoles may cease to function.

47:45.360 --> 47:47.660
So we break your mod chips!

47:47.660 --> 47:48.660
That's right.

47:48.660 --> 47:54.880
Um, the other thing that it did allow, um, is the freeloader to stop working.

47:54.880 --> 48:00.520
So if you were, uh, thinking about using your freeloader to play other region, uh, GameCube

48:00.520 --> 48:02.640
games, you just got served.

48:02.640 --> 48:03.960
You got fucked over.

48:03.960 --> 48:09.440
I'm surprised to see Nintendo caring so much because they didn't in the past.

48:09.440 --> 48:12.680
Maybe they were afraid of future exploits like that, I don't know.

48:12.680 --> 48:13.680
Who knows?

48:13.680 --> 48:19.160
Uh, one other thing that should be said is the Wii system update also made the USB keyboards

48:19.160 --> 48:20.440
now start working.

48:20.440 --> 48:25.240
Uh, you can actually plug in a USB keyboard into the back of the Wii, uh, and you can

48:25.240 --> 48:28.780
use your keyboard for the message board messages.

48:28.780 --> 48:30.880
You can use it to type in some things.

48:30.880 --> 48:35.600
Uh, you can use it when you're, um, like writing questions for everybody votes or whatever.

48:35.600 --> 48:38.680
Uh, you can also do the internet channel.

48:38.680 --> 48:39.680
Hooray.

48:39.680 --> 48:45.400
However, you can't use it in the shop channel to search and I don't know what that's about.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.800
Uh, can you use it in the internet channel?

48:47.800 --> 48:48.800
I thought you couldn't.

48:48.800 --> 48:50.600
Uh, apparently you can.

48:50.600 --> 48:51.600
I'm pretty sure you can.

48:51.600 --> 48:53.840
So, I don't know, I'll have to try it.

48:53.840 --> 48:58.760
I bought a USB keyboard for Final Fantasy XI for the 360 and then I stopped playing.

48:58.760 --> 49:00.600
So I have one sitting out there that I don't really use.

49:00.600 --> 49:01.600
And it glows blue.

49:01.600 --> 49:02.600
It's really pretty.

49:02.600 --> 49:03.600
So.

49:03.600 --> 49:05.600
I still had one from when I played, uh, Blue Burst.

49:05.600 --> 49:06.600
Ah.

49:06.600 --> 49:10.000
Well, or if I should just say Fantasy Star Online.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Right.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Hm.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.680
At any rate, there's other stuff.

49:15.680 --> 49:16.680
Well for anyone...

49:16.680 --> 49:17.680
I'm sorry.

49:17.680 --> 49:18.680
I'm sorry.

49:18.680 --> 49:19.680
I'm sorry.

49:19.680 --> 49:20.680
You know what?

49:20.680 --> 49:21.680
You're right.

49:21.680 --> 49:22.680
I screwed up.

49:22.680 --> 49:23.680
It's, it's actually, you can't use it to do any of that other stuff.

49:23.680 --> 49:25.940
You can only use the keyboard for the message board messages.

49:25.940 --> 49:26.940
I screwed up.

49:26.940 --> 49:29.200
That was a can't on the internet channel.

49:29.200 --> 49:30.200
My bad.

49:30.200 --> 49:33.280
Well that's what I get for not testing it myself.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.400
I was, I'm just not kinda interested in that.

49:35.400 --> 49:40.240
I'm like, why would I use the Wii to surf the internet when I have a computer five steps

49:40.240 --> 49:41.240
away that can do it?

49:41.240 --> 49:43.240
I just don't get it.

49:43.240 --> 49:44.240
Sorry kids.

49:44.240 --> 49:46.200
Some people I guess want everything to do everything.

49:46.200 --> 49:50.840
I like having one thing that does one thing and then I think it does another thing.

49:50.840 --> 49:57.000
Well anyway, um, for anyone who has actually been keeping up with Super Mario Galaxy, there

49:57.000 --> 50:03.840
has been a few screenshots put in Famitsu, um, showing that there is a desert world and

50:03.840 --> 50:08.240
a haunted house so we can get our buddy Boo coming back.

50:08.240 --> 50:11.200
A desert world and a haunted house in a Mario game?

50:11.200 --> 50:12.520
That's completely new.

50:12.520 --> 50:15.800
Well, I don't think, was there actually a desert level in Mario Sunshine?

50:15.800 --> 50:18.880
In like every single Mario game since Mario Brothers 3.

50:18.880 --> 50:19.880
I don't know.

50:19.880 --> 50:23.720
I lost interest in Mario Sunshine about halfway through it.

50:23.720 --> 50:31.240
But Super Mario Galaxy will be coming out later this year and I want, and I want it

50:31.240 --> 50:34.840
to actually keep my attention.

50:34.840 --> 50:36.440
Awesome.

50:36.440 --> 50:39.720
Now, some other interesting stuff coming out.

50:39.720 --> 50:47.000
There was a patent found online for a motion sensing portable or at least something for

50:47.000 --> 50:55.000
a portable system to sense directional movements on the all different axis, basically a six

50:55.000 --> 51:00.300
axis built into a Game Boy Advance type thing.

51:00.300 --> 51:11.160
So um, maybe something in the future to be added to the DS, new handheld console, who

51:11.160 --> 51:12.160
knows.

51:12.160 --> 51:17.000
If I were to guess, I would say that maybe something to plug into the Game Boy Advance,

51:17.000 --> 51:24.400
or actually the DS, the Game Boy Advance slot, to use that actually as a controller for different

51:24.400 --> 51:25.960
games.

51:25.960 --> 51:31.920
Because you know, the DS, it can connect to the Wii, so might as well add some tilt sensing

51:31.920 --> 51:34.000
to it as well.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.720
God, I hope they're not putting out another portable system.

51:37.720 --> 51:38.720
Oh, they will.

51:38.720 --> 51:42.600
And they'll call it the Game Boy something else and they'll be like, hi, you get to buy

51:42.600 --> 51:44.400
it again, bitch.

51:44.400 --> 51:48.000
Part of me kind of hopes that they're doing this so that nobody else will.

51:48.000 --> 51:53.460
Like maybe they're doing one of those, like, what is it, the company that keeps filing

51:53.460 --> 51:55.000
the patents on the immersion?

51:55.000 --> 51:58.640
Yeah, like they're doing one of those types of patents where they're just doing it before

51:58.640 --> 52:03.720
anyone else can think of it because of the success of the Wii, I don't know.

52:03.720 --> 52:06.560
I just hope not.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.560
We'll see.

52:07.560 --> 52:13.280
Meanwhile, for the Nintendo consoles, as we mentioned earlier, Metroid and Super Metroid

52:13.280 --> 52:17.240
have been confirmed that they are on their way to the Virtual Console a little later

52:17.240 --> 52:22.200
this month, leading up to, of course, the release of Metroid Prime 3.

52:22.200 --> 52:26.680
All this can be found in the new Metroid Prime 3 preview channel, which you can download

52:26.680 --> 52:29.960
for the Wii, which I tried to do, but it would work.

52:29.960 --> 52:32.880
I got like three download arrows in a row, so I was like, forget it.

52:32.880 --> 52:36.560
Did you check out the Metroid Prime 3 preview channel, Loki?

52:36.560 --> 52:37.960
No.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.240
I could care less.

52:39.240 --> 52:44.240
I heard that basically it just has some pictures and things, and it has streaming video incorporated

52:44.240 --> 52:45.240
into the channel.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.240
Awesome!

52:46.240 --> 52:50.560
Why don't they do that with anything else, say the Virtual Console games, you bastards?

52:50.560 --> 52:53.000
You prove that you can do it, come on, do it.

52:53.000 --> 52:59.560
I don't know, I would also just kind of like to see demos, but I know the online storage

52:59.560 --> 53:01.680
on the Wii isn't very big, so probably asking for a lot.

53:01.680 --> 53:05.560
Stop crippling your damn system, people, seriously.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.120
Interesting.

53:07.120 --> 53:11.280
Drunami says, it's cool, but it's YouTube, basically.

53:11.280 --> 53:16.760
Well, you can't get an accurate portrayal of what the game looks like with something

53:16.760 --> 53:18.080
like YouTube graphics.

53:18.080 --> 53:23.000
I can't wait for someone to modify that channel, because I'm sure that whatever it's streaming

53:23.000 --> 53:28.520
is probably off the internet and not on your console, so that would be pretty cool to change

53:28.520 --> 53:32.200
the DNS in it or something, to stream video off of other things, so you could actually

53:32.200 --> 53:39.160
turn it into not really YouTube, but I don't know, maybe get Justin TV on there or something.

53:39.160 --> 53:43.520
Son of Dad says, I want streaming videos of Super Metroid.

53:43.520 --> 53:48.680
Well, maybe somebody will make a streaming video of this next segment, it's something

53:48.680 --> 53:50.760
we do every week here on the program.

53:50.760 --> 53:52.600
It's Dark Sakura's website of the week.

53:52.600 --> 53:56.260
She surfs the internet up and down and all around to find a website that she wants to

53:56.260 --> 53:58.080
share with all of you at home.

53:58.080 --> 54:07.760
So Dark Sakura, tell the kids where they should be pointing their web browsers this week.

54:07.760 --> 54:17.360
Today's website of the week is really a result of wishful thinking on my part, but it's ferretsunlimited.org.

54:17.360 --> 54:21.800
It's basically a shelter for ferrets.

54:21.800 --> 54:27.560
They have adoption services and they're actually in Ohio, but the good thing about this site

54:27.560 --> 54:36.240
is it also has information about needs, it has links to other shelters, how to shop,

54:36.240 --> 54:44.320
how to take care of your ferret, and eventually, so I'm working on trying to eventually have

54:44.320 --> 54:46.480
a ferret baby myself.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.560
Even though they're still illegal to own in California, aren't they?

54:48.560 --> 54:51.960
Not if somebody brings them out of state.

54:51.960 --> 54:55.000
You're going to smuggle in a ferret in California?

54:55.000 --> 54:57.120
You're going to smuggle in a ferret, hell yeah.

54:57.120 --> 54:58.920
You probably wouldn't be the first one to do it, I'm sure.

54:58.920 --> 54:59.920
Well, no.

54:59.920 --> 55:03.520
And on top of that, there's a few other sites out there on the internet that tell you where

55:03.520 --> 55:10.200
in California has a list of vets who will take care of your ferrets and not turn you

55:10.200 --> 55:11.200
in.

55:11.200 --> 55:12.920
So I think that's pretty cool.

55:12.920 --> 55:20.440
Or even better, they still sell the crap for ferrets at the store, but even though they're

55:20.440 --> 55:21.440
not allowed over here.

55:21.440 --> 55:23.440
Ferrets are the best pets ever.

55:23.440 --> 55:29.560
As much as I love my cat, I really want a ferret.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.120
What's going to happen when you have a cat and a ferret?

55:31.120 --> 55:33.000
Are they going to chase you around the house?

55:33.000 --> 55:36.960
Actually, I'd love for Shermy to get chased around the house, that big fat animal.

55:36.960 --> 55:43.200
Okay, my cat is intensely obese, and she's lazy, and I can't even chase her around the

55:43.200 --> 55:44.200
house.

55:44.200 --> 55:48.120
She's like, oh, it's just mom, she'll just step on me and then I'll be okay.

55:48.120 --> 55:54.720
Rob Roberts, reminding you to help control the ferret population, have your ferret spayed

55:54.720 --> 55:55.720
or neutered.

55:55.720 --> 55:56.720
Yes.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.320
And RossdielUT asks a good question.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.960
I actually don't know the answer to it, but I'm assuming you do, DarkSakura.

56:00.960 --> 56:03.560
Why the fuck are ferrets illegal in California?

56:03.560 --> 56:07.480
That's, okay, I don't know the entire thing.

56:07.480 --> 56:11.920
I actually haven't seen anything legitimate about it.

56:11.920 --> 56:17.000
But they're talking about some problem with certain breeds of them being endangered and

56:17.000 --> 56:24.120
with having this wild ferret population from strays, and I was like, that's stupid.

56:24.120 --> 56:25.180
I'll tell you why.

56:25.180 --> 56:28.000
It's because of Beastmaster.

56:28.000 --> 56:34.160
Because they don't want another one of those crappy movies made in California, so no ferrets,

56:34.160 --> 56:36.160
no Beastmaster sequel.

56:36.160 --> 56:37.160
You know what?

56:37.160 --> 56:40.940
My friend, before I moved out here, my friend- At least not another sequel.

56:40.940 --> 56:47.040
My friend was going to give me his ferrets, and their names were Koto and Poto.

56:47.040 --> 56:50.520
Okay, I'm on Wikipedia, of course, to find the answer to this question.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.260
Oh, I'm on ferretnews.org.

56:52.260 --> 56:57.280
And in the ferret article, it cites this reference, the Fish and Game Code of California, and

56:57.280 --> 57:02.720
what it says, quote, animals of the families viviridae, I'm sorry, I'm totally mispronouncing

57:02.720 --> 57:07.440
these, and mustelidae, which I'm assuming the ferrets belong to, in the order carnivora

57:07.440 --> 57:14.280
are restricted, because such animals are undesirable and a menace to native wildlife, the agricultural

57:14.280 --> 57:17.600
interests of the state, or to the public health or safety.

57:17.600 --> 57:20.160
In other words, they don't want ferrets gone wild on mountain streets.

57:20.160 --> 57:24.920
That's exactly, see, that's so stupid, and right now, they're actually still petitioning.

57:24.920 --> 57:37.800
And the last news as of March 29th was that, it was on here saying that, they're doing

57:37.800 --> 57:42.080
this thing where the government's trying to say that people do not want to have ferrets,

57:42.080 --> 57:45.360
when actually the most population of people are like, we don't mind ferrets.

57:45.360 --> 57:49.600
Yeah, but then you're going to get those two people that let the ferrets run loose outdoors

57:49.600 --> 57:54.480
like a fucking cat, and it's going to kill things, and screw up the ecosystem, and then

57:54.480 --> 58:01.480
you're like, I didn't know that ferrets shouldn't be outside, I'm totally oblivious to that.

58:01.480 --> 58:05.760
And then, you know, they ruin it for everybody.

58:05.760 --> 58:08.200
I don't know why we're talking about ferrets on a video game show.

58:08.200 --> 58:09.200
Hey, that's Orange Lounge.

58:09.200 --> 58:11.440
Yeah, we have ferrets, okay?

58:11.440 --> 58:12.440
A ferret.

58:12.440 --> 58:13.440
The ferret's in the box somewhere right now.

58:13.440 --> 58:14.440
Ferrets are great.

58:14.440 --> 58:15.960
We don't have a ferret in the studio yet.

58:15.960 --> 58:23.600
But no, I really, I really, really, really, really want a ferret, so I'm working on trying

58:23.600 --> 58:25.920
to get my significant other to agree.

58:25.920 --> 58:29.780
All right, I really, really want to get back into gaming news.

58:29.780 --> 58:35.880
Just to answer, son of dad ferrets live anywhere between 10 to 15 years.

58:35.880 --> 58:43.880
All right, anyways, so interesting stuff, actually I guess a decent game for the iPod.

58:43.880 --> 58:44.880
Hold on, wait a minute.

58:44.880 --> 58:48.120
Tiger Claw in chat has a great point.

58:48.120 --> 58:50.680
There's no ferret video games, like ever.

58:50.680 --> 58:51.680
Let's fix that.

58:51.680 --> 58:54.800
Has there ever been a ferret video game ever in existence?

58:54.800 --> 58:57.680
Has a ferret even been a character in a video game?

58:57.680 --> 58:58.680
Beastmaster.

58:58.680 --> 59:00.880
I cannot, besides Beastmaster.

59:00.880 --> 59:05.320
I can't think of anything where a, this is a travesty.

59:05.320 --> 59:07.120
2DX16 ferret.

59:07.120 --> 59:10.680
No, we need to have a game, okay, now that's.

59:10.680 --> 59:13.200
It said 2DX Troopers, that's bullshit.

59:13.200 --> 59:17.280
Let's put that up on the Orange Lounge Radio Xbox Live Arcade wish list, okay?

59:17.280 --> 59:21.720
We have Laser Cats, the game, and now we have Ferret, the video game.

59:21.720 --> 59:23.440
What, Loki?

59:23.440 --> 59:27.840
Actually there has been a ferret video game for the Game Boy Color created by Culture

59:27.840 --> 59:28.840
Brain.

59:28.840 --> 59:34.440
It's called Ferret Monogatari Watashi no Okini Eri.

59:34.440 --> 59:36.520
A big what?

59:36.520 --> 59:39.840
Anyways, Ferret Story, my dear ferret.

59:39.840 --> 59:45.720
It's a Japanese only video game that's a simulation style game where you take care of a ferret.

59:45.720 --> 59:48.400
It says at the start of the game you choose one of three different colored ferrets, colors

59:48.400 --> 59:53.060
are randomly chosen, the ferret is kept in the cage a bunch of the time but you have

59:53.060 --> 59:56.160
to keep his water and food topped off and clean its litter box.

59:56.160 --> 59:59.400
You can take the ferret out for walks or to play with it.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.320
You can also even play mini games, one is a race, one is putting together a picture

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:04.320
and the other is dancing.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.320
It's Nintend Ferret.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:09.440
Yeah, and just like Nintendogs, the game gets fucking boring after playing it for an hour.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.880
I'm getting the ferret game, you watch.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.680
Hold on, we got a lot of comments in chat here on the ferret game.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.800
SSJ100Matt says, there's a ferret-like creature in Pokemon.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.760
Eh, not really a ferret.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:24.800
TheRobD says, was there a ferret in Bible Adventures or in Super 3D Noah's Ark?

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:30.040
Probably not because ferrets are unclean, they're not God's animals.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.800
They weren't allowed on the Ark.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.200
Like lice, I don't think Noah took lice on the Ark.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.200
That's ok, the lice were in their hair.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.920
They didn't have rid back in the day.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.920
Exactly.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:45.120
RosteelUT says, putting a ferret in a video game will ensure that Schwarzenegger will

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.080
never let ferrets in.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.920
You know what, he's a bastard anyway.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.560
I didn't vote for him.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.320
I voted for Gary Coleman.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.280
I voted for Mary Carey.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:00.920
Bandit says, there was a ferret in a video game called Penguin Wars for the Game Boy.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:05.000
Why would a ferret be in a penguin game?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I don't know.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.560
This is too bad.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.760
Alright, sorry Loki.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.040
Please put the show back on track if you can.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.240
There's this news website that has a character that they talk about, well a video game news

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.440
site that's called Toothpick the Ferret.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.160
He has a giant cloud sword.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:27.200
Anyways, so yeah, a game for fifth generation iPods called Musica.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:35.160
It's created by the man behind Parappa the Rapper and it's a game that's basically

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:40.580
a music visualizer game.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:46.040
More background I guess than anything and I guess when the game creates visuals based

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:51.360
on the titles of your songs then it asks players to tap the center button in time with each

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.440
letter of the name.

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.960
And you get points for doing that and build up your combo, yada yada yada.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:03.120
So if you're interested in buying it, it's $4.99 on the iTunes store.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.120
I might have to check that out.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.240
I've been kind of wanting to check that out.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.360
But only if you have a fifth generation iPod.

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.720
Well I might be able to dig one of those up.

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.720
I think that this one I've got here is so I'll have to check that out.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.120
Of course you won't be playing this because you hate Apple and you don't have an iPod

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.880
so that's right, not for you.

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:26.160
Let's see, Tigerclaw, I hate to go back to the ferret thing but the chat room just won't

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.920
shut up about it which is what I love about having a chat room.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:34.320
Bright stun says Hotaru Fukuba from Garumarka the wolves had a yellow ferret.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.440
I found the game online but it's a flash game.

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.720
Let's see what else is there.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.200
Tigerclaw says if Nintendo or Sega is listening they have a potential franchise if they create

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.480
Sonic the Hedgehog type game starring a ferret.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:48.640
Who knows.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.960
Well one game that probably won't be getting a ferret any time soon is Beatmania 2DX.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.900
Of course Loki was just talking about one other type of music game for the iPod.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:02.400
We got to go all the way back and honor one of the first music game series there was in

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.400
existence.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:09.120
Beatmania now in 2DX in its 15th incuration is now being location tested.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.520
It's called DJ Troopers is the new theme.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.520
It's so stupid.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.000
It's kind of a silly name but of course a lot of people thought Red and Happy Sky were

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.320
dumb names too.

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.760
Happy Sky made sense at least it was very you know, Englishy.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:27.120
Well DJ Troopers I give it a chance because it's kind of green like camo colors are kind

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:32.000
of green so that's one color they haven't really done yet so I give it a chance.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.200
What is the cutest thing ever?

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:39.600
Beatmania 2DX has not really changed a whole lot over the past few games.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.040
I mean little subtle changes here and there but the game itself hasn't changed a whole

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.040
lot.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.280
Well it has been location tested or is it going through location tests in Tokyo right

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.720
now and some of the songs are sneaking out.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:55.760
There's a new song from Chorus K called Evergreen, a new song from Akira Yamaoka called Shift.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.960
It's a techno song, should be fun.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.560
Another remix of A is in the game which should be interesting.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.360
New songs of course are green colored in the song list.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.560
The five keys modifier now uses keys three through seven instead of one through five

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:14.320
when playing on the two player side which is kind of a different type of change there

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:22.520
for those that like to play five key mode and a song called Deep Strikers has 1,528

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:29.240
notes on Hyper and is a 12 rated song on Double Hyper and that's going to be crazy.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.480
They got rid of a bunch of songs by the way.

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.320
Bag is finally no longer in 2DX.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.720
But also Sad Diamond Jealousy is also gone finally.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.720
So there you go.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.640
I'm sure we'll be hearing more about this on your favorite music gaming website as the

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.040
week goes on and more stuff comes out of location tests.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.160
I'm sure YouTubes are coming far behind.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.800
Well I have some happy that I hope would be something that happens.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:04.360
There is actually a hint about there being a downloadable sequel on PSN for Parappa.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.480
I would just be so happy to have more Parappa.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.120
But right now it's in rumor phase.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.640
The creator of Parappa the Rapper just sort of talked about it.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.640
Not really.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.560
He said, oh yeah, let's just do it.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:18.560
Fuck Parappa.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:19.560
I want Umjama Lammy.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.360
Dude, that would be cool.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.560
How come we always hear about Parappa this, Parappa that, Parappa remake, Parappa going

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:30.440
to be on the PlayStation Network maybe but there ain't shit about Umjama Lammy.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.600
We need Umjama Death Metal.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.280
Or what was it, there was Umjama Lammy and then Rami was her friend, right?

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.280
Rami.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:39.280
And Rami was her opposite.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.280
Who was the goth chick.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.280
Yes.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.040
And this is something that sucks because I wanted the hell level but instead they put

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.800
him on an island.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:51.960
And Rasteel Utis theorizes maybe it's because Umjama Lammy sucked but that would be a lie

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:56.520
because Umjama Lammy was awesome so I failed to see your logic, I'm sorry.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.280
So there you have it.

01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.080
I suppose though if the Parappa thing did come out for the PlayStation Network and it

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:08.520
sold like crazy, maybe we could convince them to do an Umjama Lammy song in game.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.520
We'll see.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.120
All right, anyhow, that's going to bring this segment of Orange Launch Radio to a close

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:17.080
but we will be back with Part B right after a quick break.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:21.760
Orange Launch Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:22.760
a week.

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:46.200
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Launch Radio.
