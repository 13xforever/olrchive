Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:27.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loko.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
And yes, our show is a little bit broken tonight. I mean we were off for a week due to a studio move.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Meaning that the studio we used to record in is no more. It's gone.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
And we're actually in a temporary location tonight. We call it Studio Loki.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
And it's brought to us by the one and only Tech Master Loki who is also here on the program tonight.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Yes it is.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
How are you doing Loki?

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm doing okay and I'm still trying to untangle this microphone cord, but that's okay.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
That's right. So if you notice some things are a little bit different tonight, like our opening was not its usual self.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
And you know some other things, the sound might be a little bit different than what you're used to.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
This is why, because we're in our temporary home. I'll get more into that in just a moment.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
But I also want to introduce our other guests tonight. Say hello to Miklotov.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
Wouldn't I be the first guest tonight? Because you said the other guest and you just introduced Loki.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
One of our other guests. I'm sorry. I'm totally out of it tonight.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Obviously. Hello.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
All right. And also say hello. Gosh, you're mean tonight. And say hello to another guest.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Extifer.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
But it's fitting though, right? I mean, Shane's always mean.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I'm always mean.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
All right. And I'm sure you guys are probably asking what happened to Dark Zagrow? Where is she?

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Oh my God. What happened to her? Oh my God.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
Actually, she's had some family issues this week. She had a death in the family, unfortunately.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
So she's tending to those issues tonight. So obviously our thoughts are with her.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
So yet another reason why our show is in chaos tonight is that, you know, Jamie had to pull out at the last second, which we can obviously understand.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
But she should be back next week with us here at Orange Lawn Radio.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
But I know the listeners and ourselves. We're all thinking her and her family this week.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
Meanwhile, let's talk about what's going on with the show is that basically we moved.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
And of course, the show taped out of the spare bedroom at the apartment I used to share with Extifer.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Well, we've moved on and Extifer's moved and I've moved into a new house.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
And the cool thing is, is that we're going to tape out of the garage now. So it's going to be like this huge studio.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
But here's the problem. We tried to call Comcast to get an appointment like a week before we moved.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
Like just after we taped the last show and they said they would not come out until like August 7th.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
So we were screwed with no internet. It has been hell trying to have internet at the house for this week.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
There's been like nothing. Stolen Wi-Fi. That's it. And we couldn't broadcast a show off of stolen Wi-Fi.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
So we had to move to a temporary home this week. So that's why we're at Studio Loki tonight.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And things are a little crazy.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
But that's OK. We didn't want to go two weeks of not having a show.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
I mean, because we seriously considered it because of everything going on with Jamie and going on at the other studio.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
But we just didn't want to have to go two weeks with no show because that can sometimes be suicide for listeners and everything.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
We really appreciate those of you guys sticking with us.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Of course, we are in chat. We have everything up. We should hopefully still have Skype line tonight.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to join us in the chat room.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
And of course, lots of gaming news tonight.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Loki's got something really big he wants to talk about in Part B. It's going to be really cool.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
So we'll talk about that a little later.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
And all right. Let's get into how was your gaming week.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
So we'll start off. How was your gaming week, Loki?

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
Extremely busy. That's basically how I can describe it.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.000
I played so much crap over the last few days, or actually the last couple of weeks, that it's just ridiculous.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Well, let's start off with the PSP stuff.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
I went back and played through a little bit more of WTF.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
And that game is weird. The more games I unlock, the weirder the game gets.

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
And it's awesome, though. I recommend checking it out. It's probably dirt cheap by now.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
Another game I played actually just came out in the UK called State Shift.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
It's kind of a futuristic racing game.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
I guess a little bit like Wipeout, but it's with cars or these futuristic vehicles.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
Didn't care for it too much. The cars drive like giant bricks with rockets on them.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
And it was impossible to make corners and stuff.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
So not a game I would pick up, but then again, I'm not in the UK, so it doesn't matter.

04:33.000 --> 04:39.000
Final Fantasy, I finished it finally, and I'm so glad I'm finished with it,

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
because those new dungeons that they added on with the PlayStation 1 release, it's just crap.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
It's just like, oh, we need some dungeons, quick, let's make some.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
I mean, and they have no continuity whatsoever, just crap.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
And I was so pissed off at the game, so that's done.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
Final Fantasy II, I played it for about five minutes, turned it off, because I didn't want to play it anymore.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
The battle system is just not good.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
What? I love Final Fantasy II. I played it on the Game Boy Advance a lot. You don't like it?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I don't like it.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
But you know, for me though, I think Final Fantasy XI takes a lot from Final Fantasy II,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
like in regards to the whole job systems and stuff, the way you kind of level your characters.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Maybe I'll try it again, but yeah.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
I love Final Fantasy II. I think it's more fun than Final Fantasy I.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I can't wait to play the PSP port.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Wait, so you have Final Fantasy II on PSP, and you're not playing it?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Yeah.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I think you should let me have it for a little while.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Might be fun. I have no internet at home. Take pity on me.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Maybe.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Alright.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
Anyways, so beyond the PSP, on the 360, I played quite a few things, including some demos.

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
I tried the demo for Beautiful Katamari, which a lot of people don't know is actually out there.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
It's not on live, but if you happen to subscribe to the official Xbox magazine,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
there is a demo disc for Beautiful Katamari in the September issue.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
It is extremely short. It's only three minutes long, but goddamn do I want that game.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
It's beautiful.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
How beautiful Katamari.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
The other thing, let's see, I played Darkness.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
That one looks okay. It looks like a pretty good game.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
The demo kind of sucked, though.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
I don't know. Not what I'm going to buy, but I'd probably rent it.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
I did buy Overlord, and that game I played the demo of, and I thought,

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
oh, I'm probably going to get pretty bored of this really quick.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Actually, I'm pretty surprised.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
I've been playing it quite a bit, and at first you're like,

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
well, maybe it should be slightly good because then the townsfolk will help you out with stuff.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
Then eventually they start pissing you off, and I think that they programmed that game that way on purpose.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
So I just go through the towns and basically kill everybody, and I can do that over and over.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
I've got my wenches, and it's awesome.

06:49.000 --> 06:58.000
And then, let's see, I also, on the PlayStation 3, I got my import copy of Wengen Midnight.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
And that's pretty cool.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
The game itself, though, graphically looks like a PlayStation 2 game.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
That's probably the only disappointing thing about it.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.000
Otherwise, I guess it's exactly like the arcade game.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Do you think they were originally building it for PlayStation 2 and just decided to...

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
It came out for PlayStation 2 last year, but it's not...

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
I mean, the graphics, if you were to put it up against Knee for Speed or Juiced or something like that,

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
it would horribly fail.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
It's just, I don't know.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
It kind of went a little lazy there, but otherwise, it's an okay game.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Worth checking out a little bit more.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
Unfortunately, the whole story mode in the game is all Japanese, so I don't really understand any of it.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
But I figure it's just racing, so it can't be that hard.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
God, I know there was some other stuff I played, but I can't remember.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Those are basically the main things.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
All right, moving on.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
MyGamingWeek, and I'm looking at chatroom at chat.orangelandrater.com.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Jvmon says, Skye must be dying without World of Warcraft.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
You know, I wasn't until I heard all the news from BlizzCon this week, which we'll get into in a little bit.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Nexfer is going to give us a report because he was there at BlizzCon.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
And then when I heard all of that, I was like, I have to give my character to 70.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
But before BlizzCon happened, I was doing okay with no World of Warcraft, because I was busy moving.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Like, you know, when you have all this stuff, you've got to get out of another place.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
And believe me, I have a lot of crap, okay? I have a lot of crap.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
So moving that kind of kept me busy and kept my mind off, wow.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
But when I did finally get everything settled in and I had no internet, that didn't leave a whole lot to play.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
So I went back to old PlayStation 2 games that I never really finished,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
and the first one that came to mind was Kingdom Hearts 2,

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
because I played that game quite a ways in before the first time I played it, and then just kind of stopped.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
So I'm just restarting that, and I pretty much caught up to where I was.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.000
And, you know, Kingdom Hearts 2, yeah, I guess its biggest downfall is that the battle system is kind of a bit of button mashing,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
and it's nothing that intuitive.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
But I'll be damned if you don't just kind of immerse yourself in the world,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
and the way they tie things together is so great.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
And the voice acting is pretty darn good, except for Aerith, I hate her.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
And everything else, the music and the graphics and the full motions, it's a great game.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
One of my favorite PlayStation 2 games.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
I remember the other game I played, Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3, I played the demo for that.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Oh, the demo, how was that?

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
It was very short, again, but it kind of reminds me a little bit of God of War,

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
but it's a whole lot of button mashing, it seems like, because it's basically two buttons that you do certain moves with,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
and you can switch your weapon up a little bit.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
But, I don't know, I'm probably going to pick it up, just because there's not a whole lot coming out for the PlayStation 3,

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
so, you know, it's worth my money.

09:36.000 --> 09:43.000
Interesting comment, Dark Tetsuya says, Kingdom Hearts 3 should use something along the lines of Final Fantasy 12.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
Final Fantasy 12 did have a pretty awesome battle system, but I don't know if it would work in the Kingdom Hearts universe.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
But a lot of people think that Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be different, because I believe the creator has said,

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Kingdom Hearts 3 is not Kingdom Hearts 3, it's something else in the Kingdom Hearts universe.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
So, we'll see, it's still a ways out before they announce anything.

10:00.000 --> 10:06.000
Raven's Dolphin in chat says, Sky got so much stuff, moving a lot of gay porn books takes a lot of space.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
You would know, Raven's Dolphin, you would.

10:08.000 --> 10:13.000
Mikotov, how was your gaming week? What kind of games did you play this week?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
Well, I'll start with Sunday, I was at Comic Con, so...

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I was going to ask you to give us the Comic Con reports, since you weren't here last week. How was that?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Boring. I don't like comics.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
Why did you go to Comic Con?

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
I went for Heroes and Battlestar, and I was happy with both of those.

10:30.000 --> 10:38.000
But I got to play Silent Hill Origins, and I haven't played that since it was the behind the shoulder camera.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
And it's actually looking really good, and it was really fun.

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
It wasn't really scary, because it's in a bright room with a lot of people, and you're playing it on a PSP.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
But whatever, it was still cool.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
Other than that, I played World of Warcraft.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
And I played Loki's demo of Beautiful Katamari, and that's really it.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Did you enjoy Beautiful Katamari?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Yes, it was a really fun three minutes.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Best three minutes you ever spent?

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
No, but it was a fun three minutes.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
What would be the best three minutes you ever spent?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Next question.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Oh my, alright. Game-wise, game-wise.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Next question.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Fine. Jerk. Alright, so that's it for your gaming week?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I think so, I didn't really do much.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I never do much with WoW.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
You've all been pretty boring between, you know, moving and all this other stuff.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Hiding my office clothes.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
You've been moving out of your office.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Yeah.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Is everything okay? You doing alright?

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
Was there any last hurrah? Did everybody go out for drinks one last time or anything?

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
No, actually. Nobody went out for drinks. It was weird.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Alright.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
We normally drink for no reason. This was a reason and nobody drank.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
I hope I'm okay to say this on the show, though, but as I understand,

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
there's little bits and pieces that you collected for listeners in the future.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Yeah, and I'll give those to you to give away.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
So, more information at a later date on you can own a piece of what once was Konami.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Aw, it's so sad.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
How sad.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
Alright.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Why are we laughing?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
I'm sorry.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
It's the seven legged lamb I'm looking at. Look how adorable.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
It's actually really, it really is sad because I know we had a lot of friends that worked there like yourself, so it sucks.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Yeah, it's just me.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
It'd be better if it was a chicken because, you know.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
They had to kill it because it couldn't be.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
What in the hell are you guys looking at?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
This is the worst.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Seven legged lamb.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
This is the worst radio ever. You're showing pictures of a seven legged lamb in studio.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Because it can't poop.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Alright.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
What?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
They had to kill it because it couldn't poop.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Seven legs and no ass.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
And it was a hermaphrodite.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Why are you reading Perez Hilton during this show?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
I don't know.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
That has nothing to do with gaming.

12:37.000 --> 12:44.000
Last time I saw a zombie reindeer, one that had frozen and rotted away and it looked like a zombie reindeer.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Wow.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Next.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Oh my gosh, this is the worst radio.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Yes, Dark Tetsuya summed it up in chat.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Worst radio ever.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Thank you very much.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Whenever you're the worst radio ever.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
This will be the last show from Studio Loki because this is what happens to the show.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Alright, anyhow.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Housekeeping real quick.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
We weren't here last week so we weren't able to tell you guys that we got nominated in the podcast awards at podcastawards.com.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
So thank you guys very much for helping us to get the nominations.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
And the voting is now open.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
So if you head on over to www.podcastawards.com, you can vote for Orange Lawn Radio.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
We're nominated for best gaming podcast.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
And it's really cool because like lots of independent podcasts are nominated.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
They upped it from 5 to 10 this year and there's like lots of independent podcasts nominated.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Like a lot of good shows, including our good buddies at All Games.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Yeah.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
And they are whoring now that they're trying to get people to vote every day.

13:31.000 --> 13:40.000
Yes, you can vote every day and I know that even though they've kind of made it seem like that there is some sort of prevention against automated voting and stuff.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
You can vote once per day, once per e-mail.

13:44.000 --> 13:52.000
So just make sure that you're checking your e-mail to hit those confirmation e-mails.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Just do it legitimately.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Don't cheat.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
It is legitimate.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
No, I was just going to say it gives us a bad name.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
It is legitimate.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
No, I'm saying for the people out there.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I know.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Be legit and ethical.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm not saying use a program to do it or anything.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Don't.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Please don't.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
I'm just saying, you know, if you have e-mail addresses you can vote four times.

14:09.000 --> 14:17.000
Seriously, people that are listening to gaming podcasts are probably so fucking sick about hearing about podcast awards.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
So, you know.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Well, it was just nice to be nominated again.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Yeah, blah, blah, blah.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
It's always lovely to be nominated.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
But we want to win again, so.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
You know what's better than being nominated again?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Winning again.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
That's what's even better.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
No, I'm just teasing, really.

14:31.000 --> 14:38.000
No, it really is great that we got nominated and the fact that there's like a lot of shows that haven't been in there before and it's all independent.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I hoard us out to my work again.

14:40.000 --> 14:48.000
Those people, those people that do the shows that got nominated, you know, they don't get a lot of, I don't think any of them, I don't think any of them get paid to do their business.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Screw Attack was on there.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Do they?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I don't know.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
I don't even know.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
Well, they're affiliated with, you know, game trailers.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
But hey, at least One Up wasn't on there.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
You know, at least like IGN wasn't on there.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Picking fights today with the corporate cast.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Well, technically they're video casts.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
I don't know if that's true.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
I mean, they get paid to do what they do.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
So they are, and they have built-in ads and magazines and stuff.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
So all the casts that got nominated, you know, they don't get that same built-in advertising.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
We need this.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Yeah, we need this.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
So do they.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
So hooray for nominations.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
Okay, we need to change the topic.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
Moving on, let's talk about some gaming news.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
We'll start it off with a little bit of news from BlizzCon.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Of course, that's the big weekend news.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
And we're going to go over to Xtavor for a full report, but first, if you haven't already heard,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
here's some of the news that came out of BlizzCon.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Wrath of the Lich King, or Lich King.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Wrath of the Lich King.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
It looks like Lich King.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
The Lush King.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I like that.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
How about Wrath of the Lich King?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Have you ever played WoW Drunk?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
How about Wrath of the Lush King?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I've played Final Fantasy Drunk, but not WoW.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
I think I've played WoW Drunk.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
You've played WoW Drunk.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Yeah, because I sang on Ventrilo.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Wrath of the Dawn King.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
So if you're a Mieglatov, it's Wrath of the Lush King, is the new WoW expansion.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
And even though there's going to be no new races, there is going to be a new class, Death Knight.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
So that's kind of fun.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
And apparently every race can be a Death Knight, so there's going to be lots of Death Knights.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
And I've already reserved the name Death Cake, so you can't have it, for Death Knight.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
Well, I was just going to say, you know, if you were like, say, Leroy Jenkins and he was a knight,

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
he would be a Death Knight, because he's dead in the game, because he got killed.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
Anyways, what's not funny though, is the fact that you may need Burning Crusade,

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
in order to play some aspects of Wrath of the Lich King.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
Which is not surprising, because I think with Burning Crusade it did raise the level cap,

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
and obviously you're not going to be able to go to 80 if you don't have Burning Crusade.

16:50.000 --> 16:57.000
But, they haven't really said exactly what will not be available if you don't have Burning Crusade.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Well also, it should be pointed out, there's some new battlegrounds,

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
and it's going to have siege warfare and buildings that you can destroy with your siege weapons,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
so that's going to be pretty awesome.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
And then supposedly you're going to be able to customize your characters even further than what you can do now.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Yes, new hair, I can't wait.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
That's good, because it is kind of limited right now.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
You know what the best thing so far about the expansion is?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
What?

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
It's blue, like crazy. I cannot wait.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Because it's ice and cold and all that stuff.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Yes, it's snowy, and I'm so excited. I could talk for hours about it,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
but I guess it's Christopher's job because he went there.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
Well, let's talk to Christopher. How was BlizzCon, Xtavor?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
First of all, how did you go? It was a birthday thing, right?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Yeah, my sister got it for me for my birthday.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Oh, that was sweet, and didn't think to invite us. That's alright.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
I know.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
But it's $100 per ticket.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
We would have bought it. We would have bought it now. We were moving. It's all good.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
Well, tell us about, what was it like when he got there? What kind of stuff did they have going on?

17:48.000 --> 17:55.000
Well, we got there pretty early in the morning on Friday morning because we wanted to get our badges,

17:55.000 --> 18:03.000
and found out that there wasn't no lines for badges because they had booths everywhere to get your badge.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
A lot of people had been there since 4 o'clock in the morning anyway,

18:06.000 --> 18:13.000
so we just went up, got our badges, got our swag bags, and waited for the doors to open.

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
They opened the doors. When you walked in, it was really dark.

18:18.000 --> 18:26.000
You could see the main hall, which is where they announced the expansion, and it was in bright blue.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Yay, blue!

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
They had two big screens and a lot of chairs.

18:32.000 --> 18:39.000
Everybody filled up the chairs and people were standing on the sidelines.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
People were blocking everybody's view.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
The people that worked there weren't that great at directing everybody.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
People kept on trying to sit down in the middle of the aisles.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
They would sit there for 10 minutes before the people that worked there would tell them to get up.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
Anyways, the opening ceremony was pretty good.

18:56.000 --> 19:04.000
They talked about a lot of stuff, Starcraft 2, World of Warcraft, and they showed us the trailer to the expansion.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
That was pretty cool.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
I think everybody knew that the expansion was going to be called Wrath of the Lich King,

19:11.000 --> 19:18.000
because in our maps, there was a specific area that said World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King area.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Everybody was clued in as to what was coming.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Plus, it had been leaked to the internet two days before.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
While you all were driving down, the whole internet knew thanks to some European thing.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
I guess the official Blizzard site in Europe leaked it.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
So we all know it was Wrath of the Lich King.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
Yeah, still some people were skeptical. They thought it was going to be Maelstrom.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
But, I don't know.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
The Wrath of the Lich King, we got to play it three times.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I personally really liked it.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
What was the demo like? What did you do in it?

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
Well, you start out in the Undercity area and you fly on a...

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Whatever that is.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
I think your computer just farted.

20:03.000 --> 20:10.000
Okay, for those people not in the studio, that's the pipes from someone next door.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
They're using it and there's air in the pipes.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
That was a cool noise.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
That was a Silent Hill noise.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
That was freaky.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
I wish the folks at home could hear that.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Alright, so expansion.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah, we got to play the expansion.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
We start out in Undercity, ride a zeppelin to the new Northrend area.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
You don't really know where it is in Northrend, but just that it's in Northrend.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
And it's the Howling Fjord or whatever?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Yes, that's correct.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
I just couldn't remember.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
There were so many names that you discovered in the expansion.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
We didn't know where we were.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
And pretty much you go to this grassy type area first.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
There's a town and you're next to the ocean.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
And you can go up, you ride this lift up to the top.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
And there's actually in the trailer for Wrath of the Lich King, you see the top of the lift.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
So you're kind of excited because you're playing a part that's in the trailer.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Then you can go to the right.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
There's a lot of snowy area you can go into.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
And then there was a lot of burning woodsy areas.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Okay, too much detail.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Did they let you play Death Knight?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Did they let you?

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
No, they don't let you play Death Knight.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
But they did play that trailer over and over and over and over again.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Did you get to do anything in the demo that you can't really already do in WoW right now?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
That's, yeah.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
That's nothing really new.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
You can do quests, but they weren't really new.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
You could tell that they were holding off on that stuff.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
It was just really kind of a way to explore the area.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
There was a dungeon you can go to.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
And so lots of nerds could go.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
You know, I played it first before any of you did in my Murloc suit.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Really, I would say it was a good start.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Good start because you could...

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Good effort.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Yeah, good effort.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
And it wasn't like you couldn't go to the other areas that were already there.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
Because one of our players is a mage who can portal you.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
And he portaled us to another city.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
And it was kind of cool because we were the only three people there.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
So yeah, it was kind of cool.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Cool.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
How about StarCraft II?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Did you get a chance to play that?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Yeah.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
StarCraft II.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
I've never played StarCraft before, let alone any game like StarCraft.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
So I was new to the whole genre.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
But I can say that I really liked it.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
I really enjoyed it.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
Very good graphics.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Very good.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Lots of detail.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Very hard, I can imagine.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I was on easy mode and it was hard.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
It was difficult.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
But you were just a noob, that's why.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Yeah, yeah.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
But I mean, yeah.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
That's right.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
But it was pretty cool.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
And there was...

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
The whole area was just...

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
It was just people everywhere.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
There were stores.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
There were lots of stinky people.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Lots of stinky con people.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Actually, there were people from all walks of life.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
There were families there.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Full families.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
There were all fucking alliances.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
But that's besides the point.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
There were families there.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
There were people that were fat and nasty there.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
There were nerds.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Just skinny, scrawny nerds.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
There were hot people.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
I mean, people dressed in blood elf costumes.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Yeah, you were saying before that Leroy Jenkins,

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
the guy that does Leroy Jenkins,

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
was there because...

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
He was there.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
You were like...

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
He was fucking hot.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
...wetting your pants over that guy.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
He actually...

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
Okay, Jay Moore, who was the DJ of the whole event...

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
He did a last comic standing, right?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Yeah.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Before he got fired.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
He actually...

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
He did a really good job.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
There were some hecklers that derailed the closing ceremony for a little bit.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
But he pulled it together.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Everybody was laughing.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
He made even the most skeptical people.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
There was one girl behind me that was ragging on him the whole time,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
and then she started laughing by the end of the show.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
So he was actually pretty good.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
I actually enjoyed him.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Had he ever played World of Warcraft or was it just a paycheck?

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
I think it was just a paycheck, but he did know some things.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
But yeah, there were...

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
There was probably stuff that they told him in the boardroom or whatever

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
before he walked out.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
But...

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
DJ Dark Knight in chat wants to know,

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
were there Korean players there?

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
But he's no Jamie Kennedy, that's for sure.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
Actually, there were Korean players there.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
Mostly for StarCraft, but there were people that won

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
the costume contests in the Korean Invitational that they did a few months ago,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
or a month ago or whatever.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
They actually participated in the costume contest this year,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
and it was a warlock and they were done very well,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
but it just so happens there was another warlock that topped them.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
And she was just incredible.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
She was like, oh my god, she looked incredible.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
But yeah, the Leroy Jenkins guy was there,

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
and he did his Leroy Jenkins, and he was just too hot for words.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
Wow, nerdy.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
How was video games live?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Awesome.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
They did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft, as you can imagine,

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
but they also...

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Yeah, that's the one who won, I'm sorry.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
Anyways, they did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft,

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
but they also did the new music from StarCraft II,

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
which was sucky because it sounded exactly like Star Wars.

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
But we got to hear that, and we got to hear lots of music from Diablo,

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
and there was also a band that played last night.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
They were like this horde band.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
It was totally manufactured by the makers of WoW,

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
you could tell because the creator of WoW was in the band.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
But nevertheless, they were funny.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
What were they called? Level 70?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Level 70 Elite, Tauren Chieftain.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
Did they actually dress up like Tauren?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
No, they actually didn't.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Like they were Gwar or something?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
They didn't, but they did.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
When you went and waited in the line to play Wrath of the Lich King,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
there was a big screen next to them,

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
and they kept playing the video that was game made.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
They made it in the in-game video for that,

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
and it was just incredibly ridiculous, but it was funny, I guess.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.000
But they have a song called Rogues Do It From Behind,

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
which was just funny because I'm a rogue,

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
and I do it from behind.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I think I just threw up in my mouth, thank you.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
I was going for that.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
If only there was a camera to capture everybody's expressions just then.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
So yeah, the whole show was pretty good.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I had such a fun time.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Good deal. Anything else you want to share

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
that you think our listeners ought to know about?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
What was the funniest thing that happened all show?

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
The funniest thing?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Yeah.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
Oh God, all the nerds asking stupid questions at the panels.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
They would say stuff like,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
okay, we're not going to answer these questions,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
and what do the nerds fucking do?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Give us an example.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
The movie panel, you said which one, right?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Movie panel, okay, that was a big thing.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
They're actually doing a movie,

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
the same people who did Batman Returns,

26:48.000 --> 26:55.000
or Batman Begins, Superman Returns, legendary 300 or whatever.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
They are doing the movie, and they are really standing by this film.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
There were questions that they wouldn't answer, though,

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
and those were,

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
we won't answer questions on which races, which characters will be in the movies,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
but you can expect to maybe see these,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
and they listed these characters, right?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Everybody cheered.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Okay, then the question answer comes,

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
what do the fucking gamers ask?

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
What races and characters are going to be in the game?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Can you please tell us?

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Okay, didn't you fucking hear?

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
You're wasting our time when other people can be asking,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
like, actually informative questions, you know?

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
So it was kind of, you know, annoying,

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
but Dark Knight wants to know, he would have asked,

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
and will we be hearing back me wool in the movie anywhere?

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
We should.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Get in the archives if you don't get that joke.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
In fact, they said that there's going to be a lot of humor carried over from the game,

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
so they're looking forward to carrying some of the humor,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
but still keep it on a serious level.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
You didn't tell them about what the worst part of the movie is so far.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Oh, well, they're going to tell it from the Alliance perspective.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Boo, Alliance sucks.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
Yeah, and the funny thing about it is that most people there,

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
we got the feeling that most people there were in the Horde,

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
which is funny because most people that play the game are Alliance,

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
but they're all kids that can't afford to go to BlizzCon.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
Son of Dad is in chat, wants to know who's directing the film, did they say?

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
They don't have a director. There was somebody that asked that.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
They want to get the script all together first before they go search for a director,

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
and he said, oh, there was a funny story.

28:31.000 --> 28:39.000
The guy that is with Legendary said that the guy who played Superman last year,

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
he said they won't go into casting details,

28:41.000 --> 28:47.000
but they did say that last year he overheard the Legendary people on the phone with the WoW people,

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
and he said, oh, my God, can you get me a backstage tour of where they do WoW and all this stuff,

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
and they did, and he went.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
I seem to remember hearing something about that that guy was a WoW player,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
the guy who was Superman. Funny.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Oh, he'd make a pretty blood elf.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Yeah, he would.

29:03.000 --> 29:11.000
Oh, they did give kind of a, not a spoiler, but they gave us an idea of where they're going with the film.

29:11.000 --> 29:19.000
The very end of the panel, they showed a picture, which is an artist's rendition of what might go on,

29:19.000 --> 29:23.000
and they showed, what is it, the tree, the big tree?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Oh, tell the blah, blah, blah.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Yeah, the night elf tree. I can't remember. I'm not Alliance.

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
Whatever. Fuck it. But it was a really pretty picture, and everybody went crazy.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
So, telladristle. That's what it is.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Something like that, yeah.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Yeah, but it was really fun.

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
And I recommend, I think that the best part, well, one of the best parts for me besides the expansion

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
was the fact that I actually did like StarCraft II. I think people should give it a try if you haven't.

29:49.000 --> 29:55.000
I also miss the boat on StarCraft I, but what's crazy is that my boyfriend loves StarCraft.

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
It's like the only video game he plays is StarCraft, and he is all excited about StarCraft II.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
So, it's just kind of interesting.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Because he's Asian.

30:03.000 --> 30:08.000
Shut up. Let's see, looking at chat, another comment here.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
Darktitsui wants to know, will the WoW movie be 60 hours long?

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
That would be awesome.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
They said it's going to be between two and two and a half hours long.

30:16.000 --> 30:23.000
Well, yes, it will be 60 hours long, but then you can buy an expansion for just $39.95 that will expand it to 70 hours long.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
Yeah, it was kind of funny because one of the people on the panel made a comment,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
well, this first one will be blah, blah, blah.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
And everybody was like, oh, my God, sequel.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Somebody, some stupid dumbass asked a question about a sequel.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
They're like, okay, you guys, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
Let's make sure we knock this one out of the park first and then go on for sequel.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
All right, we're going to have to have a whole sequel to the show to cover all the BlizzCon news.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
We've got to get on to some other news.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
RosteelUT in chat is pulling up a pillow and blanket because he just doesn't care about WoW.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
We don't care about whoever that was that you just said.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
I don't care about WoW either.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
All right, are you doing okay over there, Loki?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
I'm doing fine.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
All right, well, let's get on to some other news.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Thank you guys very much for your respective con reports.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Actually, Mikotov, yours was kind of bad.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
I didn't really care about your report.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Whatever, I didn't even really talk about it.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Yeah, you didn't really do anything.

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
Well, I could talk about it more, but I don't want to because it's true.

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
Tell us really, I don't know, maybe if they don't like World of Warcraft, they like Battlestar,

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
but please tell me about how you met the guy that played Tyrrell and what you did.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
Okay, spoilers maybe, just so everybody knows.

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
The guy that plays Tyrrell, Aaron Douglas, was at Comic Con, and I went to go get his autograph.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I went up to him, and I was like,

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
can you write something mean about Callie?

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
Callie sucks, and Callie is his wife on the show, and I absolutely hate her.

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
He laughed at me, and then he started signing my thing I gave him to sign.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
He put, to Shane, Aaron Douglas, chief.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
I can't wait for Callie to die in season four, episode five, dot, dot, dot.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
That was my favorite thing ever, and now I have something to look forward to.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
I'd just like to point out that Shane called me long distance, like right after this happened,

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
just to tell me about this experience.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Because it's important.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
It was like the coolest thing ever because I hate her a lot.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
He's known to give away spoilers and stuff like that, so that could really be a real spoiler.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
Well, there was one other convention going on that, unfortunately,

32:18.000 --> 32:23.000
OLR did not have any representation at, but certainly there's a lot of news coming from QuakeCon,

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
and John Carmack at QuakeCon announced a brand new franchise for ID Software.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
That would be Rage.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Rage is going to be like an action-adventure game,

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
and it's from a brand new engine that ID Software is doing called Tech Five.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
It's going to be simultaneously launched on the PC, the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360,

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
and believe it or not, the Mac.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
Yeah, originally when they were showing off the Tech Five demo, or Tech Five,

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
I guess it was a demonstration of it, they were actually showing off bits of Rage,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
and it's kind of got a little bit of driving in there.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
There's a bit of first-person shooter stuff in there as well,

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
so it's kind of like Motorstorm meets Quake.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
In fact, here's a quote from Todd Hallensheet, the CEO of ID Software.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
It's more than just a first-person shooter.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
We will show vehicles and racetracks, driving and racing elements.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
It is an action-oriented game, but with a lot of adventure elements.

33:13.000 --> 33:18.000
It will be story-driven, but you can also choose your own route to go through things.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
As long as it's better than Quake 4,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
because Quake 4 held my interest for about three seconds,

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
and I was like, eh, not interested.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Yeah, well hopefully this will hold your interest for a little bit longer than that.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Quake Arena is headed to Xbox Live Arcade.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
Now this is something we kind of knew a little bit of before

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
when the ESRB kind of leaked that out,

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
but apparently they had some really good success

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
with the Doom franchise on Xbox Live Arcade,

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
so now they're hoping to repeat that with Quake.

33:47.000 --> 33:52.000
And I'm assuming it is going to be kind of like Unreal Tournament type of thing,

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
but with Quake, so awesome.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
When I first read about this, though, I was thinking,

33:57.000 --> 34:03.000
is this like the old-school version of Quake, but just adapted for Xbox Live?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
It might be, I don't know.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Is that like the original Nine Inch Nails soundtrack and all that?

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
I don't think so.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Oh, I'll be sad.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
I have fond memories of Quake.

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
This was back in the day when broadband you could only find in colleges, right?

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
Broadband was not really sold for commercial use,

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
and my friends went to college in the Bay Area,

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
and I used to call in dial-up to their broadband connection,

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
and we would play Quake.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
About three of them in the dorms and then me on dial-up,

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
we'd stay up all night long playing Quake. It was awesome.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
You couldn't do that with Duke Nukem Forever for some reason.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
I don't know.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Because it never came out.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Perhaps this is another game people will stay up all night playing, though.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
I don't know. It's a game called Quake Zero.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
I'm going to take a wild guess and see that it's probably Quake 3 Arena

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
coming to Xbox Live Arcade since...

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Actually, it's different.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Quake Zero is going to cost zero.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
That's why it's called Quake Zero. It's free.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
I understand that, but the port of Quake 3 Arena...

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
Oh, so the Quake Arena game...

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Well, that would be awesome. Quake 3 is my favorite.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Well, there you go.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Oh, that would be great.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
Well, anyway, Quake Zero is going to be a web-based version of Quake 3 multiplayer,

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
so you can just fire up your web browser and play.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
Because, I don't know, has the source code been out for Quake 3?

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
I can't remember.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
It doesn't matter because it's being developed in-house anyway, so they have it.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
But they're going to be putting it out there,

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
and I guess it's going to be ad-supported.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
It's going to have some in-game advertising.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
That's how it's really going to be zero dollars.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
But free is good.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Man, I would love to see Quake, and I'm playing it,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
and then there's a McDonald's ad or something.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
That would make it totally realistic.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Dark Tetsuya says,

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
LOL Quake Zero. Zero calories, zero sugar.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
I guess, you know, from all that sitting...

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
More caffeine.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
More caffeine, exactly.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Nintendo Maniac 64 said,

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
I wonder if Quake Zero will be anything like Phosphor when it runs on Shockwave.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
RosteelUT says,

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Yeah, ID released the source code ages ago.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
I thought I remembered reading something about that.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
Now if only Quake Zero were compatible with the Wii web browser.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Which I honestly doubt it would be.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
But we can hope.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
One thing that will be compatible though,

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
they announced Unreal Tournament 3,

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
which is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 later this year.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
It's going to be supporting keyboard and mouse.

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
So that's kind of cool.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
I know a lot of people really love keyboard and mouse,

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
especially playing PC first person shooters.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
So now you can actually do that on the console

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
and kind of have a fair shake at people playing on PC.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
Or as the people playing on PC.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
That's kind of cool because that will put that whole debate to rest finally.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
People can take it out.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
What is better, the controller or the keyboard and mouse?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
People can finally duke it out.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
Unreal Tournament 3 for the PS3 is actually kind of shaping up more like a PC game.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
I mean, obviously it is a PC game as well.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
But with the fact that you can download mods for it.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
That is pretty awesome.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
I got to hand it to PlayStation 3 for that.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
It's going to be sweet.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
We will see.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Bravens Dolphin in chat says,

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
Bluetooth mouse and keyboard for the win.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
Tiger Claw said,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Unreal Tournament 3 players with keyboard and mouse

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
will pwn the UT3 players with the 6 axis.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
Well it's not like the keyboard and mouse are going to vibrate either.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
So you got that.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
Also some other news coming out of QuakeCon.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
Is this coming out of QuakeCon or is this just about the same time?

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
It's about the same time.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
It might be out of QuakeCon.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
We will see here.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Actually this story is coming from Ain't It Cool News.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Which is kind of interesting.

37:41.000 --> 37:47.000
Roger Avery is working on an adaptation of Castle Wolfenstein.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
Fuck yeah.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
Apparently it's actually returned to Castle Wolfenstein.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
And apparently the producer of Silent Hill,

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Samuel Hadida already has the rights to it.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
And he gave the property over to Roger Avery to write and direct.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
And if I'm not mistaken, Roger Avery did the script for Silent Hill, right?

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
I think so.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
I think so.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Didn't he?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I don't know, but I know he's not doing it again.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
I know he was tied to it.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Oh yeah, we talked about that a couple weeks ago.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
Well I'm talking about it now, so continue your story.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
We'll see.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
According to Ain't It Cool News,

38:16.000 --> 38:22.000
they expect we'll see World War 2 crazy tongue-in-cheek horror sci-fi action.

38:22.000 --> 38:28.000
I wonder if you'll get Hitler in the big mech like you fought in the game.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
That would be kind of strange.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
It sounds horrific for Uwe Boll, though.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
Oh.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
I forgot to mention that earlier.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I interviewed Uwe Boll this week.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
What the hell?

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
How did you not mention this to me?

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
People turned the show off ten minutes ago.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Sorry.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
With all the loud talk.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
I forgot.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
You met Uwe Boll?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
I didn't meet him.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
I interviewed him over the phone, though.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Oh, okay.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
But not for this show.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
I interviewed him for my work.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
What the hell?

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Alright, well what happened?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Did you find anything else?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Okay, well here's the thing.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
I had to watch his movie, BloodRayne 2 Deliverance,

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
and it's horrible, as you would expect,

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
but it was a vampire western,

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
and so we got to interview him about that,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
and I asked him a few things.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
A vampire western?

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
It's a vampire western, yes it is.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
That could be cool, though.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
It could be cool, but it's not.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
No.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
So, now obviously the interview was tame

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
because, you know, it was for a magazine,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
so we had to be positive about the whole thing,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
but we did ask him about the boxing stuff.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
That was kind of funny.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I actually have the whole interview transcribed

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
on the Orange Lounge live journal community,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
so if you want to check it out there,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
you can see everything we talked about.

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
We also talked about there's a new movie he's doing

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
called Tunnel Rats that's being made into a game

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
at the same time,

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
so that's kind of an interesting thing,

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
and then of course Postal's coming out this year.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
They had a lot of advertisement at Comic Con for Postal.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
It was weird.

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
As crazy and bad as his movies are,

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
I really want to see Postal.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I think this is reverse psychology.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I think this is brilliant marketing

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
where somehow they're getting the word out there

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
that the movie is brilliant.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Like, there were preview screenings already, right?

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
Yeah, and people are saying it's pretty funny.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
The whole thing is going to be offensive,

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
so that's all that matters.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
So we got to talk to him.

40:19.000 --> 40:24.000
He's a very interesting guy, but I don't know.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.000
Okay, interesting is a very broad word

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
because you could know a guy that picks his nose

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
and eats it and you could go,

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
that's really interesting.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
I kind of felt bad for him a little bit

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
because he's not trying to make awesome movies.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
He's just trying to make genre flicks

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
and he just happens to use video games

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
to kind of supplement that to get more of an audience.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
I don't know.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
He's kind of an underachiever, I guess.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Who gets out of bed in the morning and goes,

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
I want to make a vampire westerner?

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Film students?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.000
I guess so.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
I think we should make Orange Lawns Radio the movie

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
and it should be a vampire western.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Okay, the movie itself I knew was bad

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
like within the first two minutes.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
I watched the whole movie and fast-forward

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
because I couldn't stand it.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
Luckily though, I got to hear most of the dialogue

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
because it was really slow.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
The only bad thing about it, there was no nudity.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
That kind of sucked.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
But, Zach Ward, the guy that plays the main character

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
in the Postal movie, he played Billy the Kid, the vampire.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
I kind of liked him in that.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
I thought he was a good vampire

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
and here's why he was a good vampire.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
He would hurt innocent people without a thought.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
For example, the very end of the movie,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
she's going to rescue these kids

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
because he's going to bite them all and turn them

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
and make them more immortal or something.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
She walks in and this trap springs

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
and basically all the kids get hung.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Awesome!

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
She's pushing this counterweight back

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
so the kids don't die, but unfortunately

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
one of the little kids dies.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
That's so good.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
There's stuff like that throughout the whole movie.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
And they're not afraid to hurt innocent little children

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
in the movie.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
I can respect that.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
So, I don't know.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
Wow.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
Anyways.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Kill children, earn points for Loki.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Actually, I got to say real quick

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
is that Robert M. in our chatroom

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
at chatonorangelandradio.com

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
has the first piece of casting news

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
for Orange Lounge Radio, the new vampire western movie.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Loki has been cast to play Tingle.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Amazing.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.000
There is no Tingle in this movie.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
But where will we get our rupees?

42:36.000 --> 42:42.000
Anyways, moving on to something completely opposite of that.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
Lego Indiana Jones was announced at Comic Con

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
because there aren't enough Lego franchises yet

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
and they're going to milk that for every penny that they can.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Lego games aren't that bad.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
They aren't that bad.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
I can think of worse games.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
I can think of far worse games.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
They aren't that bad.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
So, following Lego Batman this year

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
you're going to be seeing Lego Indiana Jones next year.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
And I want Lego Batman, by the way.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
That'll be pretty cool.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
Well, it's a pity that Jamie isn't here

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
because she would probably be running circles around this story.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I'm very happy about this one.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
Apparently, there is a Doctor Who video game

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
that could be on its way for Christmas.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
Top Trumps has revealed a plan for a Doctor Who video game

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
to be released in time for Christmas 2007.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
It's thought to be available on the PC, PlayStation 2, DS, and mobile games.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Apparently, an advertisement for the game appears

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
in the new Doctor Who Top Trumps card pack.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
But now, I want to say that I saw a follow-up story to this

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
that said this actually may not be true.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
That there was a retraction to this story that came out a little later.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
So, it could be a little bit iffy, but

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
I mean, Doctor Who seems perfect for a video game.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
I mean, I don't remember where I read this.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
It was one of the blog sites, so I apologize for not giving you credit.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
But, they put it brilliantly.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
They said, this is good news and bad news.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
The good news is it's a Doctor Who video game.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
The bad news is it's a Doctor Who video game

44:04.000 --> 44:08.000
because video games that are based off of TV shows and stuff

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
usually don't go too well.

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
That's true, but remember they announced that Battle Star game

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
for Xbox Live Arcade a while back?

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
It came out last week, I think.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Did it actually come out?

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Oh, Battle Star. I'm sorry. I'm thinking Wing Commander.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
Oh, no. Battle Star. I know it's on PartnerNet

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
and my friends that work at EA have been playing it

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
and they actually said it's a pretty fun game, even though

44:30.000 --> 44:37.000
they're hardcore fans and it really is a typical space shooter

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
with Battle Star just plastered on it.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
Nothing really Battle Star related beyond that.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
So, you get occasional gems and I hope to goodness that

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
the Heroes game that Ubisoft is doing is going to be good.

44:49.000 --> 44:57.000
There's no need to really worry about games that come from TV shows, I think.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
I guess that's a little bit more encouraging there.

45:00.000 --> 45:06.000
Well, there is another interesting rumor that's come out recently

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
and this is one that has me extremely excited.

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
Apparently, EGM has run their rumor mill story from Quarterman.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
He does this every month.

45:16.000 --> 45:23.000
And the rumor is that apparently they were, I believe, level 5.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
They developed some RPGs and stuff.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Oh, actually, no. They weren't the ones that developed this. My mistake.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
Anyways, Bionic Commando.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
It was originally going to be made into a PlayStation Network game.

45:35.000 --> 45:41.000
However, they decided that they're just going to make it into a full-fledged game instead.

45:41.000 --> 45:47.000
So, possibly a Bionic Commando game soon.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
That would be all kinds of rad because that's like an old series

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
that a lot of people would like to see get brought back.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Hell yeah.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
I'd be very happy about that.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.000
As long as they don't turn it into a completely different game.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
You know what I mean?

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
Try to keep some of the elements that made the first one fun.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I would not want to see Bionic Commando go 3D.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
That would not be fun for me.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
But, I don't know.

46:10.000 --> 46:17.000
If they did it like if it was as good as the Rygar game,

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
when they updated that, that wasn't too bad, I think.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
But...

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room, chat.orangelandradar.com says,

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
Dear Capcom Wii version. K, thanks.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
That could be interesting.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
I don't know. We'll see.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
Well, there's some games that you will no longer be playing

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
if you're a fan of EA online games because they're pulling the online support

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
for lots and lots of EA games as of September 1st, 2007.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Nothing very recent.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
The majority of the list comes from all the sports games released in 2006,

46:51.000 --> 46:57.000
such as Madden NFL 06, NASCAR 06, FIFA World Cup 06.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
All those are shutting down.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
And I guess the thought is that most of you will have upgraded to 08 by that point,

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
if not at least 07.

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
But I haven't upgraded from Madden 06.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Why do you own Madden 06?

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Don't you mean you have an upgrade from Madden 99?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
That is so not your kind of game, I thought.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
It's not.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Is it achievement points?

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
No.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
You're a whore.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
You're a whore for achievement points.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Some other games have been getting shut down, though.

47:21.000 --> 47:26.000
Surprisingly, November 1st of 07, Burnout Revenge on Xbox and Playstation 2.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
So they're shutting off one of the Burnout titles

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
and the Need for Speed Underground and Most Wanted

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
also getting the plug pulled on them November 1st of 07.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
Well, Underground's damn old and Revenge technically on,

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
well, the Xbox is the latest one.

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
But Playstation, I mean, they had Dominator, so...

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Oh, well.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
Well, if you're one of the five people that plays these games online still,

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
then you're probably pretty angsty.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
So we dedicate the FUs of the Week just for you.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Now, usually we would have music here, but since we're in our temper...

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun...

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Hey, that's the music.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
We can find music.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
That's too late now.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
We're live, remember?

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
Alright, so there we go.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
There's your music.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
And it's the FUs of the Week time.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
So, Loki, start us off tonight.

48:12.000 --> 48:19.000
My FU of the Week goes to Genki for just porting the Playstation 2 version

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
of Wangen Midnight to the Playstation 3.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
I mean, come on.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Spend a little bit more time.

48:24.000 --> 48:29.000
Hell, that fucking lame-ass game import tuner challenge that came out

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
on the Xbox 360 looked better than this.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
That's sad.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
And, you know, maybe some better music in it, too,

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
because that's kind of sad, too.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Yeah, music like that.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
My next FU goes to Shane for not shutting his cell phone off

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
during the recording of the show.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
My other FU goes to Comcast for making me suffer without internet

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
until Tuesday, and also to whichever mystery neighbor

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
I'm stealing Wi-Fi from for not being strong enough.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Although, I will give it this, like yesterday,

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
the strength of the Wi-Fi was perfect, and I was able to download

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
torrents of Big Brother to get all caught up on Big Brother 8.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
So, and Jen sucks, just for the record.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
Shane, do you have any FUs of the Wii?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
I can come up with one real quick.

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
FU to Blizzard for not giving me the expansion for free,

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
or telling me when it's going to come out, because I really want it,

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
and it's really all I've been reading about since they announced it.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
Like, me and the internet, that's all we do,

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
is just talk about the WoW expansion.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
Alright, let's get back into some news.

49:40.000 --> 49:46.000
Anyways, another cool game that's going to be heading our way pretty soon.

49:46.000 --> 49:50.000
Crysis has been announced to be released on November 16th,

49:50.000 --> 49:55.000
and that game looks damn good, and I really want to build a PC for it.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
Tell us a little more about this game, I don't know much about it.

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
Crysis is the next game in the series of, I guess, Far Cry,

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
even though there is Far Cry 2.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Oh, that's right, I've heard of this.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
But it's just, I mean, the original Far Cry game was pretty good looking.

50:08.000 --> 50:13.000
This one now is just phenomenal, the amount of detail that's in the game,

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
just the amount of physics, I mean, you can blow up everything in the game,

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
you know, everything has real world looks good,

50:19.000 --> 50:24.000
the draw distance is enormous, just, it's amazing.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
So, it also is going to be a resource hog, I'm guessing.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
Is it, like, in the future compared to Far Cry?

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Because, I mean, I don't know much about Far Cry,

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
but, like, box art right there looks like it's crazy,

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
like, 2000 years in the future.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
It's in the future, I'm assuming.

50:39.000 --> 50:43.000
Basically, it's still on, like, a tropical island type thing.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
Aliens have kind of either crash landed in one section of the map,

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
and so, you know, you have this whole section that's kind of 0G and, like, frozen.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
So, it's interesting stuff there,

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
plus the whole suit that you have is, like, a nano suit that you can upgrade.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
Like, you can switch it to, like, speed, so all your powers are in your speed,

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
and you can move around really fast, or armor, or stealth, and stuff like that.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
So, really cool looking.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
That could be interesting.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.000
Well, this is also interesting, and that is SingStar is continuing

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
to do a lot of business and coming out with new games.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
I guess this is mostly in Europe, though.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
I have not heard of SingStar really taking off in this country.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
There's another one coming out this month, actually.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
My gosh.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
SingStar amped in the US.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Maybe they are doing really well there,

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
and I think this is coming out in the US as well.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
This is SingStar Anthems,

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
and it's actually, I got to hand it to them.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
This is actually a pretty kick-ass song list.

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
If you like your power ballads and your anthems,

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
this is a pretty kick-ass song list.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Anastasia, Left Outside Alone.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
I actually like that song.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
Probably no one else has heard of it.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
Avril Lavigne, I'm With You.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
Cindy Lauper, Time After Time.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
You DDR fans, the original version of Ordinary World by Duran Duran is in this.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Alone by Heart.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
That's a hell of a power ballad.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Two songs by Mr. Mister.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
That's awesome.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
You get broken wings.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
And Queen, The Show Must Go On,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Roxette, a couple Roxette songs in there.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
What Roxette songs?

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
It must have been Love, of course.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
But what's the other one?

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
Listen to Your Heart.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Oh.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
I wanted Joyride.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
I don't care.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
That's not a power ballad.

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
And then the ultimate, the ultimate power ballad, Meat Loaf.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
I'd Do Anything For Love, but I wouldn't do that.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
That is all kinds of awesome.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
I do agree with what Joystiq said when they reported on this.

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
And that would be, this game is shit without Journey.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
How can you have a ballads game and have no Journey?

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Where's my Don't Stop Believin'?

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Is that on the Sony Open Arms?

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Is it on the Sony label?

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Because that's all they get are songs from the label.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Probably not then.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
Surprise, Open Arms isn't on there.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
I know.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
How can you have, pay whatever it takes to get Open Arms in this game.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Or Don't Stop Believin'.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Sony can't afford to buy things right now.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
They're all poor with the PS3 stuff.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
Oh, whatever.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
But if they want this game to take off, they will invest the money in it.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
I'm curious to see what Chad says about this.

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
Oh, no, they're still commenting on Crysis.

53:05.000 --> 53:11.000
RawsteelUT says, ooh Crysis, a generic first person shooter game with an extra graphical effort.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
It's not that generic.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
It looks pretty awesome.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
Whatever.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
Son of Dad says karaoke in the US only belongs in bars.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Yeah, but what if you have a bar at home?

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Like you have a bunch of liquor at home.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
That's acceptable, right?

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
You know, that's false because a lot of people I know love playing the karaoke games at parties and stuff.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
It's really fun to do.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Robert M. suggests Foreigner, Poison.

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
Son of Dad also says he wants the final countdown.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Yes.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
That would be awesome.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
I just got 2DX 4th Style finally and I love that song so much.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Is that part of the economy liquidation sale?

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Yes.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Brand new 2DX 4th Style.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
The 5 figure sale economy.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Whatever.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
It was free.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
You know, I found something the other day actually.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
What?

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
I found it today.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
I have a DDR club append.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I don't even know where the hell that came from.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
How random.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
It might be mine.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I used to have both those games.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
Maybe.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
You probably have it from when we used to live together years ago.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
No, I think Jamie gave it to me.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
She gave you a club append?

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
I think those things are actually worth kind of money.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
No, I doubt it.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Those are the DDR games nobody fucking played.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Who played club append?

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
I did.

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
I didn't play it anyways because I don't have second mix so it's completely useless to me.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
It did have a lot of crap on it though.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Let's talk about release dates, shall we?

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
And we'll travel to Europe first even though Jamie's not here tonight.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
I've got her back and it's really not a long list this week.

54:39.000 --> 54:45.000
On August 10th over in Europe you guys are getting Pac-Man Rally on the PSP.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Congratulations.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
That's really it.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
That's everything that's on the list that we've got.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
They get a crappy game for a crappy system.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Wow.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Good job.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
You want to wait for some busier weeks.

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
Get to the 31st when you guys are getting Boogie and Guild Wars, Eyes of the North,

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
and Medal of Honor.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000
Or the 24th when you guys are getting mad at NFL.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
And the game named after Loki.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
You're ruining all the future release dates.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Sorry.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Jamie's going to be so angry.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
I feel bad because there's only one freaking release this week.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
So I'm trying to give him something to look forward to.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
I don't think Europe is filled with Pac-Man Rally fans.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
I mean, if I'm wrong.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
It was.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.000
It's a huge release for them.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
If I'm wrong, Europe folks, please send us an email.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
Mailbag at orangeontree.com and please tell us how much you love Pac-Man Rally and how

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
you're going to be camping outside.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Send us your pictures from camping outside games.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I want to go camp for Pac-Man Rally.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
You want to hear something?

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
I'm lining up.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
You want to hear something about the stupid rally games that they have in Europe?

55:38.000 --> 55:44.000
We keep getting fucking some, was it SVG or something, one of these smaller distributors

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
out there keeps publishing this European crap that comes over here.

55:48.000 --> 55:54.000
For example, they have Crazy Frog Racer because ooh, we really need a game based off that

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
annoying piece of shit.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
Then there's this Cocoto Racer thing which is like some little devil looking thing.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.000
I don't know.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
Too many kart racing games in Europe.

56:04.000 --> 56:10.000
However, though, in the U.S. there's not a whole lot coming out of this week, but there

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
is a lot more than in the U.K.

56:12.000 --> 56:18.000
For example, on PSP we've got Crazy Taxi Fair War, also Tomb Raider Anniversary, that's

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
going to be coming out.

56:19.000 --> 56:28.000
On the DS you've got Mega Man, Star Force Pegasus, and Star Force Leo, and if you're

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
buying through GameStop, Star Force Dragon.

56:32.000 --> 56:38.000
Also, we've got Glory Days 2, which is supposed to be a pretty good kind of a side scroller

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
or strategy game.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
On the Wii, Boogie is going to be coming out.

56:43.000 --> 56:50.000
It's kind of a scene in karaoke game, or dancing in karaoke game.

56:50.000 --> 56:56.000
PlayStation 3, nothing, although I do believe that Splinter Cell Double Agent I thought

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
was coming out this week.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
I don't know.

56:58.000 --> 57:07.000
And then on PC, aww, no Tycoon game this week.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
That's a first.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
Damn.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
You know, I was really hoping.

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
Pac-Man Rally Tycoon is coming out on the PC, go figure.

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
No, there's Attack on Pearl Harbor, so that's kind of cool.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
And, I don't know.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Star Defender 3, woohoo.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
Alright, well coming out in Japan, Japan's also kind of having a bit of a slow week when

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
it comes to game releases, but they do have one big one that a lot of folks are looking

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
forward to.

57:31.000 --> 57:36.000
On the PlayStation 2, Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System is coming out this week.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
The dumbest name for a game.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
It's basically the International Zodiac Job System.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
It's the international version.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
Yeah, the international version that doesn't go anywhere but Japan.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
It doesn't get released anywhere else.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
I know, but there will be people importing it.

57:51.000 --> 57:55.000
There are, I believe it's just the voiceovers, you can select English options.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
I don't think the text is English.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
Oh, because that would be awesome if it was in English because then you could import it.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
Well, most of the other international versions is what people did.

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
Like Kingdom Hearts II Final Men just for chains of memories on PS2.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
But the text wasn't English, I thought.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
I thought it was just the voices.

58:11.000 --> 58:16.000
I'm not sure, to be honest, because I already have Final Fantasy XII and I could care less

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
about new systems.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
But you get to do new International Zodiac Jobs.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
Yippee.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
Whatever that means.

58:22.000 --> 58:28.000
I think it meant that you're supposed to cater your characters to more like one classic class.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
Like one of them is more like a red mage and the other one is more like a black mage.

58:31.000 --> 58:36.000
They had new classes too or something, funny languages because it wasn't English.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
Also coming out, which we should note, on the DS, the DS has a little bit more releases.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Of course, there's another Yu-Gi-Oh! game coming out, Yu-Gi-Oh!

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Dual Monsters GX.

58:45.000 --> 58:51.000
And also coming out, we should say, on Nintendo's DS from Nintendo,

58:51.000 --> 58:57.000
Donkey Kong Jungle Climber or the King of Swing is coming out in Japan as well.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
King of Swing 2, basically.

58:59.000 --> 59:04.000
And Looking at SP.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
Hey, there's a Professional Atlas Travel Guide.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
That would be the most fun game ever.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
I want to look up where Rome is at.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Wild Arms XF or Wild Arms Crossfire.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.000
You can also look forward to that.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
It's not as cool as Dust Cap 2.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
I know.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
Not as cool as Dust Cap 2.

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
Definitely.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Well, that's it.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
That's all the release dates I'm going to care to name this week.

59:23.000 --> 59:27.000
Well, one upcoming release that we're going to get some more information about at Tokyo

59:27.000 --> 59:34.000
Game Show this year is Metal Gear Solid 4, where it's rumored that the game will actually

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
have a release date announced.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
Although, we're probably guessing March right now.

59:40.000 --> 59:46.000
So, we just had a story about naming a date where they're going to name a release date.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Damn it!

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
I did it again!

59:49.000 --> 59:53.000
I thought we said no more of these stories about naming a date where they're going to

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
have a date.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.000
This is so stupid.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
I'm sorry, why do people get excited about this?

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
No, it's okay.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Fired!

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
No, we can't fire Loki.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Or else, where else would we record this week?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
We'd be screwed.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Yeah.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Alright.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Some other things to note really quickly.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Some releases coming out in Europe.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Super Paper Mario is finally coming out in Europe on September 14th, speaking of dates.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Can you believe it?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
It's coming out for 35 pounds in Europe.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Wow, that's probably how much weight you gained waiting for this game to come out, I guess.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I don't know.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Why would you just be sitting there or something?

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Wouldn't you be active?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
You're camped outside the store, remember?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Not for Paper Mario, for Pac-Man Rally thing or whatever it was called.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000
While you're enjoying Pac-Man Rally, wait for Paper Mario.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I guess, okay.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I guess you can get 35 pounds that way.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Now, what is much more important that is on the Nintendo DS on September 14th over in

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Europe is freshly picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland is finally coming out.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Loki, will you be importing it?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Because the great news is the DS is region-free.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Even though there's no plans to release this game in the US yet, you can actually import

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
this game still for probably about, I think I saw it listed somewhere for about 45 bucks

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
if you want to get Tingle.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
A waste of 45 dollars.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Why not?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Why won't you buy this game, Matt?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Why the hate for Tingle?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Because I don't like Tingle.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I think Tingle's a stupid character.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I didn't like him in Wind Waker.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Why the hell would I like him now?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Now that he has his own game?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I wonder if the game is any good.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
I haven't heard anything about it.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I don't bet he's going to be in fucking Smash Brothers Brawl.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
As a playable character?

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
And then I'll never hear the fucking end of it.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Tingle's in fucking Smash Brothers.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Check it out.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I don't think he'll be in it.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I don't remember how that got started, associating Loki with Tingle.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
It's because I did his voice once.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
And ever since then, it's just never-ending.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
It would be really weird to have him in it, though, because they're using all the Zelda

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
things.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Oh!

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Do Tingle's voice.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
That'd be awesome.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
They're using the Zelda things from Twilight Princess, and even though I didn't beat the

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
game, I never saw Tingle there.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Yeah, but he was in Wind Waker, and I think he was in one of the Nintendo 64 ones.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
He was in a crappy one, Majora's Mask.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
But they've already covered Wind Waker and all that stuff, I thought, in the last game.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000
But if they're giving him his own game, they also fucking took Balloon Fight, and made

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
his own version of that.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Come on.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I'm just not-

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It's quirky and weird in Japanese.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I hate the Japanese.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
GS68 is in chat and says, Tingle, as the Super Smash Brothers Brawl character, will Loki

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
get shot?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Wonder Dog Harold has a suggestion, Loki should just say he likes Tingle, and then no one

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
would bring up Tingle ever again.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I don't like Tingle, though, that's the thing.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I think he's a stupid character.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
All right, it's done.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
We're beating a dead horse here, seriously.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Okay, let's go on and go to break.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
We're gonna go to break, and when we come back from break, we're gonna get into some

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
more information on Part B, including some news about the Xbox 360.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Sounds pretty exciting.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Yeah, the ultra-secret announcement for next week, or this week, I should say.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Okay, we'll get into that very soon, as well as talking about some game delays, that's

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
always fun.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
And Shane is gonna read tonight's mailbag.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Totally.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
That should be interesting, to say the least.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Watch out, because I might make fun of you.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:39.000
All right, so we'll be back in just a moment with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
