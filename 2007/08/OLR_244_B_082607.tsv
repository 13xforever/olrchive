19861	20341	Orange Lounge Radio
47608	49089	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
70521	71282	It's kind of neat.
71522	76285	Apparently the tokens that you can earn in the game are in four different tiers.
76345	77826	Red, blue, green, and gold.
78747	82190	Red tokens are gained by scanning enemies and items.
82390	85552	Blue for scanning lore and completing side quests.
85852	88534	Green ones you get from friends.
89615	93878	And gold is achieved from defeating bosses on various difficulties.
94058	96980	What is different from this and like the trophies that you earn in Burnout?
97901	98541	I think nothing.
99082	99382	Nothing.
100200	100981	Absolutely nothing.
101461	103604	So what is so noteworthy about this?
103884	105906	Is it the fact that it's the first time in a Metroid game?
106026	109509	I guess people are thinking, oh my god, achievements are coming!
110190	110430	No.
111111	111251	No.
112593	117317	Alright, well one other thing that people would like to see coming to the Wii any day now is online play.
119399	120741	And also demos.
121383	121984	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
136142	155414	and on it are some different types of questions on it and they seem to point towards the all signs you could say point to the fact that they're at least exploring the possibility of doing downloadable demos of course to date all we've really seen come from them would be the Metroid Prime 3 preview channel
156550	157411	Some of the things here.
158011	161012	Please indicate your level of interest in playable demo versions of Wii games.
161372	164513	What is your preferred method of receiving Wii game demos?
164933	168634	Would you be willing to pay more for your subscription in order to receive Wii game demos?
169415	171095	So, kind of interesting there.
171355	174956	It would be kind of cool if Nintendo Power did have Wii game demos.
175056	177657	Well, the other big three consoles do for their magazines.
177717	178178	Exactly.
178398	185400	But I would like to see the Wii actually able to download things other than virtual console titles.
186792	187512	and a few crappy tales.
187532	189273	Well, they're supposed to have original software.
189293	191533	At least we know about that Mission Impossible thing, right?
191553	194374	Well, yeah, they're supposed to go online someday, too.
194454	195294	I mean, come on.
195314	196975	The console's been out for almost a year now.
197455	201576	Time to start following through with that shit you've been promising us for a while now.
203636	204017	All right.
204037	205637	Or we're going to have to start calling you Sony.
206757	207577	Ooh, burn.
207798	208038	Anyway.
208078	208358	Wow.
209398	211218	Well, how about some happy Nintendo news?
211979	212519	How does that sound?
212739	213299	Sounds good to me.
214036	216658	Well, guess what is back for Super Mario Galaxy?
216958	219720	We have fire flowers and superstars.
221060	223742	I love the fire flowers so much because they're like burning things.
224923	226924	You're just happy that Mario can set fire to things again.
227805	232427	Well, you know, the fire flower was such a great weapon and then we just didn't get it.
232467	234349	We had him squirt shit with water.
235730	235850	Boo.
236872	238333	Mario 64 Mario 64 Mario 64 Mario 64
261303	265404	I liked it on Nintendo because they totally recreated the Super Nintendo graphics on the Nintendo.
266005	268766	Going to chat room for some comments at chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
268806	272187	RossDLUT says, Loki, stop wishing and relying on Nintendo's word.
273887	275608	ShadowCharlie says, Tanooki suit.
276308	277328	That would be a great thing to come back.
277348	278349	No, no, no, Hammer Brothers suit.
278429	279409	That would be pretty rad.
279609	282150	Or the Kuriboh's boot.
282950	283871	Yes, Kuriboh's shoe.
283891	284291	That's awesome.
284311	284871	Yeah, that was it.
286430	290232	But in other news, we do have a release date for the UK on this.
290792	292013	It will be November 16th.
292653	293154	All right.
294214	295195	Not soon enough, right?
295855	296636	Not soon enough.
297176	297556	All righty.
299498	300038	Anyways.
300598	302519	I do want to know who this new hoochie in the game is, though.
302539	302740	Sorry.
305481	311365	Anyways, interesting news, and we knew this was kind of coming, but finally the Wii has passed
312377	314878	The Xbox 360 in worldwide sales.
315058	330123	Now, the last screenshot that we've seen of this was of course a few days ago with the Wii having approximately 10.57 million units worldwide and the Xbox 360 having 10.51 million units.
330603	335705	Of course, the PS3 still trailing behind with 4.32 million units.
337066	340087	It should be known though that still the 360 is outselling
341610	346573	The Wii in the US, but apparently, you know, Japan is where they're making up for a lot of slack.
349615	353178	So, what does this mean for Nintendo fanboys?
353238	357681	Is this something additional for them to brag about, or is this really not the big deal, it seems like?
358381	367747	I guess it's fuel for, you know, flame fodder, I guess, because the Wii has basically caught up to the 360 in half the time.
369649	369829	So...
372164	373666	I mean, that's really good.
374227	376791	I think if they could produce more units, it would be even higher.
377392	379935	But hopefully that means more support.
380176	380997	Better games!
382281	382741	XBOX 360 XBOX 360
402776	407260	That means it's not going to be on shelves for the day after Thanksgiving madness, so that's kind of too bad.
407340	413686	But I'm sure those people that have been very good boys and girls this year as they put this on their Christmas list, I'm sure Santa will find a way, right?
415588	415928	Sure.
416329	419252	Of course, then again, if you believe in Santa, you probably should not be playing Mass Effect.
419732	420313	Come to think of it.
421273	422455	Why does Santa die in it?
422975	423315	I don't know.
424416	424877	Possibly.
427048	438838	For anyone who is at Penny Arcade Expo, they did confirm that Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness is going to be on an Xbox Live Arcade in 2008.
438978	442161	It was also announced for PC, Mac OS X, and Linux.
443362	445183	So, hey, game.
446144	446564	Cool.
447886	448706	That's kind of interesting.
449147	451829	Is that the console you guys would have guessed that this was going to be released on?
451949	452229	Yep.
453270	454131	I sort of thought so, too.
454775	464177	Just because, you know, there's the... For a long time now, there's been the little picture icons and themes and all that stuff that you can download on Xbox Live, so why not this?
465758	467278	Why not now their game on Xbox Live?
467358	467798	Why not?
468378	470559	If there's more money to be done, why not?
471119	475020	Well, putting arcade adventures isn't the only thing coming to Xbox Live soon.
475920	482642	There is a rumor, of course, with the fall update due out in November, that it's possibly going to include XFID support.
483602	483682	Um...
484201	487103	Now, some other plans from this leaked list.
487183	499352	Supposedly a new Xbox Live Arcade Blade, IPTV support, integrated clan functionality, a picture-in-picture setting, and improved slideshow effects.
500515	503316	That would be pretty awesome if it had Xvid codec support.
503416	504797	What exactly is Xvid?
504937	506177	It's kind of like DivX.
506277	515081	It's a video codec for encoding MPEG-4 video so that you can rip a DVD and have it be a decent file size.
515761	516821	It's pretty popular.
516881	519762	But you would still have to stream it.
520803	523524	Well, I'm saying you still have to have it in WMV format, right?
524404	525244	I don't know about that.
526125	529106	I would imagine you would, but who knows.
530543	532624	Sony is also not going to E for All
557641	560962	There's also some other companies that have said they're not going, including Capcom and so on.
561242	564462	Some companies that are going, though, would be Nintendo and Konami.
564882	571503	So it's not like it's going to be an empty show, but it is going to be a little bit of a bummer that you don't have two of the big three showing up at E!
571563	572003	For All.
572684	576584	And I don't know about you guys, but the fact that I'm actually kind of planning on going to E!
576624	584426	For All, because, you know, I got an invite and everything, and I was planning the trip to go to L.A., I'm a little bit irritated that some of these companies are dropping out of E!
584466	584886	For All.
585206	586766	That news makes me a little bit angsty.
587333	589014	and when we get angsty, people die.
589314	590614	Oh, and the FUs of the week come out.
600578	603079	Oh, DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with tonight's FUs?
604420	606921	Um, FU to my broken head.
607901	608982	Really, it still hurts.
609942	612223	You know, it happened, what, four hours ago?
613328	614409	But it's not four.
614449	615069	Why am I saying four?
615449	618151	Three hours, two hours, whatever, ago, and it still hurts.
619172	625275	And a secondary FU goes toward the art block, because I've been trying to draw, and it's just not working.
625295	628377	So instead of writer's block, it's art block.
628857	629418	It's art block.
629538	633680	Oh, I've been having a bit of writer's block, too, just in different capacities.
633880	635822	So FU to blocks of all shapes and sizes.
636502	638103	To the block of creativity.
638423	638883	There we go.
639924	640224	All right.
640364	641365	Loki, your FU's of the week.
641910	646232	My F.U.s of the week go to my cat for constantly waking me up in the middle of the night.
646692	650973	It's almost like having a goddamn baby, so... Fuck you to the cat.
651394	653034	Just imagine when you really have a baby.
653114	654895	Imagine babies in your house.
656095	659136	Yeah, it's not really fun.
659497	660997	I don't really have a lot to say F.U.
661037	661877	to this week.
661957	664118	I've actually had a pretty good week, so F.U.
664138	668000	to people who don't like caramel, because caramel ice cream is awesome.
668540	669620	But then again, maybe I shouldn't say F.U.
669640	671241	to that, because that just means more for me
671997	672217	Right?
672357	672677	I don't know.
673557	676538	Mikotov, do you have any FUs of the week while you're staring off into space over there?
678038	681019	FU to you for thinking about getting Popsicles.
682119	684139	Because they are the worst.
685840	687240	Popsicles are awesome.
687480	688400	Here's the thing though, Mikotov.
688780	690360	It wasn't that I was going to buy Popsicles.
690681	691941	I was going to buy Creamsicles.
692301	693481	And those are awesome.
695321	695581	Alright.
697022	698222	Let's end this segment now, shall we?
699229	702210	Are either of you guys, is anybody else in here thinking of going to E4ALL?
702470	702990	I was.
703190	704810	I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to go, though.
705110	706631	It doesn't excite me as much anymore.
707471	708311	I would like to go.
708391	711292	I'd rather go to PAX, but that's kind of late for that.
711372	712372	It's a little bit over now.
712672	715193	What's in it for you to see at E4ALL?
715833	719714	I like Nintendo and Konami, and that's really all I remember that are actually going.
720174	726635	But not having E3 to go to this year and going to Comic-Con made me realize that I kind of miss stuff like that.
727136	728816	So going to E4ALL would be pretty cool.
729833	730113	All right.
732015	733256	Let's get back to some gaming news.
733496	734658	Now that the FUs of the week are over.
736519	738581	Well, you know, it was bound to happen.
739582	749071	For our buddies overseas, the Xbox 360 is getting a price drop in Europe, occurring on the 24th of August.
749091	750232	Okay.
751440	757063	It will be decreasing by 20 pounds on the core unit and 30 on the 20 gigabyte 360.
757923	760765	So it'll bring the price down respectively to $249.99.
760845	763026	I'm sorry, that's on the 20 gig and $179.99 on the core.
763066	765467	That's again in British pounds.
765487	766688	So the Elite will retail for $299.99.
783122	801660	Alright, well, I just gotta say real quickly for the live folks, it looks like our stream is down, and I'm blaming Operator 11 for that, so at this time I'm gonna shut this off until we can work on this some other time, because this is probably taking a lot of bandwidth, so we're gonna have to get rid of this to get our stream back, so that's the end of the Op 11 simulcast for now, until we can work on that a little later.
801720	802140	Sorry, guys.
803141	807345	Alright, but in the meantime, we will go back to... There was more news on that.
807706	808106	Oh, I'm sorry.
809519	823888	Shizzle Games of Belgium was advertising by price from Elite down to Core in Euros as $449, $349, and $279 on their SKUs.
824968	826789	And that's it.
828210	829491	I should know my apologies.
829891	835014	Their Core was being called the Arcade, and then they have the Pro.
835534	836635	Very bizarre, but anyway.
838410	839590	That is kind of bizarre.
840231	842091	It's even more bizarre that they're called Shizzle Games.
842691	845012	Shizzle Games.
845172	852775	Well, the rumor, of course, of that new arcade SKU for the core system is actually supposed to be coming to the U.S.
852855	864999	as well, and same details, no definite launch date or anything like that, but it is allegedly supposed to come out over here as well, so...
866314	867055	That's a good idea.
867195	873761	I mean, hey, the core system's not bad, but I know a lot of people complain that they can't save their game.
874001	884351	So now that that's going to be coming with a memory unit, that might be something to actually look into if you're not into the whole live downloading thing.
885290	886251	I bet you can't spell Maneuver.
914471	925703	DarkSakura likes to surf the internet up and down and all around every single week and she likes to find a website that works for all of you and it's her website of the week that she's going to share with you guys right now.
942406	946928	Website of the week is actually suggested to me by Loki, and it's actually pretty cool.
948108	950269	It's Cult of Rapture.
950449	964695	If you go to 2kgames.com slash cultofrapture, all one word, it will take you to a Bioshock page for the fans, I guess, talking about the music that's out.
964715	969677	It has downloads, articles, a forum, goodies for everybody.
969797	970518	It's pretty cool.
970578	971338	It's very pretty.
972206	973887	Yeah, it's actually very, very pretty.
975048	979250	But I do believe that you have to be over 18 to view the page.
979290	981112	So, go see it.
981152	984514	And I'll be posting the address into the chat room presently.
984754	985214	Very cool.
986515	986995	Alrighty.
989697	990017	Awesome.
990972	1019558	something else that's pretty awesome fans of Geometry Wars will be quite happy because with Project Gotham Racing 4 they'll be getting a brand new Geometry Wars game and no info though on it's supposed to be not too different than Retro Evolved but it is going to be a little bit different it's called Geometry War Waves so no real details though on what exactly is different but apparently not that much
1021001	1027823	Well, I don't know what's going to change in the great amount of time it's going to take for this game to come out, because Spore is apparently finished.
1028523	1033465	The game is not totally finished and ready to go, but apparently the game is complete.
1033505	1037786	This is coming from reports of people who have had hands-on with Spore at Leipzig.
1038526	1049089	EA is simply going to be spending the next few months listening to feedback from players, assuming the QA testers and beta testers, to tweak and polish Spore for its final release, which is still set for next spring.
1050111	1057597	So, certainly you can look around the internet on some different blogs there and find some hands-on reports from Spore, which is definitely a game I am certainly looking forward to.
1058157	1060639	So, GS68 in our chatroom says, Spore forever?
1061339	1061860	I don't think so.
1061900	1065482	I don't think you can make those jokes anymore because it does look like this game is actually going to come out.
1065542	1065983	Hooray!
1066843	1067704	So, we'll see.
1068384	1068665	All right.
1068765	1073768	Anyway, it's time for an old favorite segment of ours here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1073808	1075270	It's a segment we like to call Listless.
1075290	1075730	Listless.
1082694	1083114	All right.
1083915	1087097	The way Listless works is that we create a list here.
1087137	1091020	We're trying to define the definitive top three of a certain category.
1091060	1097464	And tonight's category is character we would most like to see in the upcoming track and field DS game.
1097524	1101967	Now, the character does not have to be a Konami character, but it helps.
1103108	1103969	So here's the deal.
1104009	1104549	Here's how it works.
1104569	1109732	We're going to go around, and myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and Miklatov will all give their top three.
1110073	1111374	So that's going to leave us with a list of 12.
1112253	1119277	Then we will all go around the room and take one unworthy candidate off the list, leaving a list of eight.
1119977	1125000	And we will post that list of eight to the chat room, and you'll vote for your number one and your number two picks.
1125380	1129483	We'll tally them up, and the winning votes will be revealed a little later in the show.
1129803	1130943	That's how Listless works.
1131484	1132924	So who's going to start us off tonight?
1132985	1134385	Loki, you ready to go?
1135866	1136266	Sure.
1136306	1140909	All right, what's your number three pick for character you would most like to see in Track and Field?
1142145	1147249	I guess it'd be a little weird, but I would like to see... Actually, this is kind of funny.
1147869	1150632	Babylon from DDR5thMix.
1151252	1153214	Ah, Babylon from DDR5thMix.
1153274	1153474	Why?
1153534	1154915	Just so you can run as a baby?
1154935	1156417	Because it's a baby running.
1156537	1157017	It's funny.
1158078	1158518	I don't know.
1159940	1162262	All right, Babylon says Loki.
1163062	1164664	Miklatov, do you have a number three pick?
1165625	1168327	I'll take Robbie the Rabbit from Silent Hill.
1170073	1175158	What's cuter than a bunny with blood on its mouth running around throwing stuff like javelins and things?
1175398	1176779	We're already picking just Konami.
1178081	1179462	You don't have to pick Konami.
1180403	1183686	I said it doesn't have to be Konami, but it helps.
1183807	1185008	I don't think it should be Konami.
1185048	1185608	The real game.
1187090	1188671	Yeah, it could be Nintendo because it's DS5.
1188691	1189933	Let's leave it to Konami.
1190073	1190613	Oh, God.
1190633	1192135	I have to rethink my list.
1192782	1197366	DarkSakura, your number three pick.
1197586	1199948	Aitsu or Koitsu from Parodius.
1201269	1203210	They're the little stickmen riding paper airplanes.
1203270	1204731	How the crap do you spell that?
1205692	1208534	A-I-T-S-U and then K-O-I-T-S-U.
1210376	1211076	From Parodius.
1211837	1212097	Yes.
1216040	1222385	All right, my number three pick would also come from DDR, and that would be Alice, the little raving character.
1223224	1226206	I don't know what you would really call it, the dog from Silent Hill 2, from the dog ending.
1254794	1256075	That's fantastic.
1256135	1256835	I love the dog.
1257695	1259756	So the dog from the dog ending of Silent Hill 2.
1259836	1261936	Good pick.
1261996	1263957	Mikotov, your number two pick.
1264057	1268918	I'm going to say Evil Rose from Rumble Roses.
1269018	1275180	Because what little boy doesn't want to watch the girls with the big breasts run around on the track?
1275240	1277221	Except for sane ones.
1278314	1282256	Alright, so one of the big tittied girls from Rumble Roses will hopefully appear in Track and Field.
1282276	1283017	No, she can't run.
1283297	1285038	Alright, DarkSakura, your number two pick.
1285478	1287719	My number two pick is going to be Pit.
1289480	1291161	Pit, for now a Nintendo character.
1291341	1292322	Okay, fair enough.
1293562	1295503	Alright, Pit from Kid Icarus.
1295563	1295944	Why not?
1295964	1296444	That would be fun.
1296484	1297344	Except he can fly.
1297384	1298365	Couldn't that be cheating?
1298685	1299826	So can Aitsu and Koisu.
1300386	1302147	Alright.
1302207	1302827	Moving on.
1302987	1304688	Number two pick for me.
1305008	1307710	My number two pick I would like to see in the game would be Dracula.
1308382	1309822	from, you know, the Castlevania games.
1309862	1310562	You know, why not?
1311783	1314503	And then somebody can come out and say... Not by my hand.
1314543	1316123	I was once again given a gold medal.
1317764	1318724	Die, monster.
1318764	1319824	You don't belong in this world.
1319864	1321044	Except that was the other guy that said that.
1321084	1323645	But I still think it would be cool if Dracula was in the game.
1324065	1325345	So Dracula is my number two pick.
1326025	1327965	Number one pick, Loki.
1328805	1329326	Oh, man.
1332026	1332706	Let's see.
1332806	1337707	Number one pick, I will say... Well, that doesn't really count because that's Hudson.
1339939	1343140	Well, no, that could work, because Konami has license over Hudson Games now, right?
1343160	1343460	Yeah.
1343480	1344140	You can do Hudson.
1344160	1349901	I don't know if this would be my number one pick, but Bomberman.
1352642	1356802	Okay, because maybe Bomberman could just leave bombs on the track, yes?
1357822	1358603	Sure.
1358803	1359203	That'll work.
1359343	1360583	Yeah, sure.
1360603	1361323	Whatever you say, Rob.
1361763	1364104	All right, Miklatov, what would be your number one pick?
1365004	1366484	The Left DDR Arrow.
1368015	1368915	DarkSakura, your number one pick.
1368935	1373418	My number one pick is the mascot from Guitar Freak.
1373438	1375999	Who's needed with the bag over his head?
1400663	1401484	I don't remember his name.
1414986	1420550	My number one pick did not get a lot of coverage in a lot of the various Konami games that existed out there.
1420670	1431458	In fact, my number one pick was really obscure because he was only in one game that Konami ever put out, and it was on the PC.
1432078	1438503	But I'll tell you what, if you've been listening to this show for some amount of time, then you know the love that the people of this program have.
1439156	1441357	My runner-up would be the Konami Code.
1461103	1463605	Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
1463645	1464626	Have the Konami code in it.
1464666	1465366	No, no, no.
1465506	1470590	Oh, I should have said the little shit from Parodius because then you can have the Sound Blaster or Twinbee.
1470930	1475053	You know what also amazes me about this list is that not a single damn Metal Gear character on the whole list.
1475093	1478235	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
1478295	1481537	Change Baghead Guy to Twinbee.
1482177	1482678	Twinbee?
1482858	1483498	To Twinbee.
1483518	1484259	All right.
1484399	1485680	I like the Baghead Guy better.
1487461	1487821	All right.
1488562	1488802	All right.
1488842	1489883	Well, she changed it then.
1489923	1490343	Twinbee.
1491557	1494059	SSJ100, Matt voted for the goalie from Blazer Steel.
1494099	1494819	That's pretty awesome.
1494879	1498742	Alright, here's the list of stands right now, but remember we're going around and eliminating off the list here.
1499402	1514732	Babylon, Robbie the Rabbit, Aitsu Kwaitsu, Alice, the dog from the dog ending of Silent Hill 2, Evil Rose, Pit, Dracula, Bomberman, the left DDR arrow, Twinbee, and Mr. Spanky.
1514752	1516813	Why left and not right, just out of curiosity?
1517514	1519535	Because it's just the first one I thought of.
1521323	1523744	Loki, one of these is not worthy of being on the list.
1523784	1525325	What is not worthy of being on the list?
1529328	1534531	I'm just going to say Aitsu, Koitsu, because I have no idea what the hell that is.
1534571	1535432	Very obscure.
1535472	1537053	Yeah, it was a little too obscure for my taste.
1537073	1537753	But they're awesome.
1537933	1538214	All right.
1539855	1541776	Miklatov, one of these is not worthy of being on the list.
1541796	1542917	What is not worthy of being on the list?
1545558	1547980	Just because it really looks out of place on that list, I'm going to...
1548723	1551824	I'm going to throw out Pit, even though I love Kid Icarus a whole lot.
1551964	1554265	Yeah, I'm sorry.
1555145	1558287	All right, DarkSakura, what is not worthy of the list?
1562088	1568231	I'm going to vote for Alice.
1569431	1571232	Alice is not worthy of being on the list.
1572132	1574033	And Raver Kids Everywhere are crying.
1574073	1574593	What's that movie about?
1575129	1577092	Have you seen Alice from Supernova 2 yet?
1577332	1580035	She's all dressed up like an Indian.
1580676	1580997	Alright.
1581718	1582178	Well, whatever.
1583119	1583660	Let's see.
1583920	1588266	The one I deem worthy of not being on the list is... Oh, this is hard.
1588686	1592872	I'm also going to take out a DDR character and say Babylon is not worthy of being on the list.
1593232	1593673	So there you go.
1594787	1610375	That leaves our list as Robbie the Rabbit, The Dog from the Dog Ending of Silent Hill 2, Evil Rose, Dracula, Bomberman, The Left DDR Arrow, Twinbee, and Mr. Spanky.
1610796	1616899	Alright, so I'm going to post that there in the chat room, and if you would, send a private message to Rob Roberts, not Sky tonight because I don't have my normal name.
1617927	1629346	set a private message with your number one and number two pick it is important what you designate as one and two if you do not designate I will assume your first pick is your number one so there you have it
1632573	1634774	Did you find anything else that you thought should have been on the list, Loki?
1634814	1636955	Because I saw you searching Wikipedia frantically.
1637495	1638696	I was trying to think whatever.
1638756	1641637	I don't remember what the boss was called in Contra.
1641997	1642937	Like the giant heart.
1642957	1646199	I was thinking the giant alien head thing would have been pretty awesome.
1646459	1649640	What about the vomiting baby turtle thing or whatever that was from like...
1651409	1652911	Aw, we should have more time to prepare.
1653632	1656035	Violent, uh, vomiting baby turtle would be awesome.
1656095	1659420	An unsold copy of, what was it, Bomberman Act Zero.
1660921	1664226	I was actually thinking, cause you know, I was thinking really obscure.
1665247	1669072	You know, if we were going Sega, I'd totally say the, uh, the Opa Opa.
1670370	1671370	But we didn't go Sega.
1671531	1672031	No, we didn't.
1672171	1672711	We sure didn't.
1672731	1674412	Because the Opa Opa would kill everybody.
1674832	1674952	Right.
1674992	1676053	Because the Opa Opa's awesome.
1676433	1682196	We will announce the winners a wee bit later, but for now, we've got to get back into some news, and then the Skype line.
1682236	1688419	Your calls at Orange Lounge Radio, username on Skype, or our 800 number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1688439	1690880	We'll get to those very shortly, but first, a little more news.
1690940	1691160	Loki.
1691553	1698780	Yes, and apparently people were not too happy with Bioshock's way they've handled widescreen.
1699300	1703604	And apparently there are some fixes, though, if you want to correct that.
1704165	1715856	There is a hack that you can download for the PC version, and it will allow you to not necessarily resize your screen, but resize the view on there.
1716557	1723403	And you can do all sorts of fun things, including different resolution sizes like 16.9, you know, true 16.9.
1724624	1730408	Because apparently the way this game worked before is they would just kind of do like a reverse pan and scan on it.
1730448	1733170	They would cut the top and bottom off on the widescreen.
1733991	1742898	But apparently there's also, I guess, there's going to be a fix coming for Xbox 360 over Live at some point as well.
1742918	1743779	At least that's the rumor.
1744785	1762124	If that's really bothering you, you can go ahead and download the patch, which is available on dl.tokaedit.com slash bioshockdfov.zip
1763230	1778988	Loki, out of curiosity, what do you think about that whole fallout about how people were really pissed about all the issues the PC was having, not just the widescreen stuff, but the fact that you could only install so many copies on one machine, and kind of like how quick they've been to respond to that.
1779348	1782672	The whole widescreen thing was stupid, I think, because, I mean, personally...
1783192	1788317	I don't think anyone noticed it during the demo until someone mentioned, oh hey, by the way, this is like that.
1788337	1790359	They're all, oh my god, that's horrible!
1790780	1795324	I mean, it doesn't detract anything from the game, so, big deal.
1795524	1799328	I mean, you can fix it on the PC now, so, I don't know, it's not a big deal.
1799348	1801009	The cop protection thing kind of sucks.
1801430	1807516	I know a lot of people are installing on multiple computers, which I guess technically violates some sort of
1808735	1809496	Writes or something.
1809596	1809936	I don't know.
1809997	1812159	But there's a fix coming for that as well.
1812239	1814922	So I don't think that's a big worry.
1815583	1817545	But yeah, little bitty things.
1819247	1819547	All right.
1820568	1822831	SSJ100 Matt says, though, Pan and Scan ruins movies.
1823732	1824032	It does.
1824713	1825734	It absolutely does.
1826034	1826795	I agree, actually.
1827476	1827716	All right.
1828503	1830524	Let's open up our Skype line and hear from you guys.
1830745	1833186	If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is now open.
1833366	1838249	Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, or you can always give us a call.
1838269	1841571	1-877-GAME-OLR is the number to call.
1841591	1842892	1-877-GAME-OLR.
1843853	1850096	And while we're waiting for those to come in, I'll just say that this is your last chance to submit your votes for Listless.
1850997	1857681	I think most people in our chat room already voted, but just in case there's a couple stragglers, we'll take those.
1858922	1859683	Let's go to the phones.
1860483	1861644	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
1861664	1862025	Who's this?
1862865	1867670	This is Raven Stolfen, the guy that got... Damn, you get through first every time.
1867750	1868230	How is that?
1868310	1869591	All right, well, what's on your mind, Raven Stolfen?
1870232	1872033	I have a fast finger and a new keyboard.
1872774	1874495	I'll leave the fast finger comment as is.
1874535	1875216	Well, what's on your mind?
1875276	1876437	Lame, mean finger.
1878699	1883223	My comment tonight is you mentioned that Nintendo surpassed the 360?
1884264	1886566	In terms of worldwide sales, yes.
1887961	1895026	Well, you know, I know this is going to turn into a flame world real fast and real quick, so I'll try to keep the flames to a minimum.
1895427	1899830	But, you know, I believe that people that buy in the Wii is not us hardcore gamers.
1899870	1905154	Like, we bought it, I bought it, you bought it, Loki bought it, DarkSakura bought it, but those soccer moms of the world.
1906795	1909317	No, I totally agree with you, but a sale's a sale, right?
1909998	1910538	A sale's a sale.
1910938	1911879	Money's money, right?
1911939	1913160	The bottom line is a dollar.
1913740	1917143	However, I will say this, what I would be curious to see...
1917859	1920640	is how many games per system is out there, you know what I mean?
1921021	1925483	Like a 360 owner probably has a lot of games at this point, whereas a Wii owner maybe doesn't have so many games.
1925903	1931806	But I don't know, that may not be true, because then again, you look at the games that are out on the Wii, there's not a lot for hardcore gamers.
1931846	1941151	I mean, there's some, you know, your Super Paper Mario, your Metroid, but there is a lot of crap out there on the Wii, like, you know, your Happy Feets, your, well, I haven't played Boogie, but I don't know.
1941718	1945699	But that commercial really wants me to, I'm memorized about that commercial, Boogie.
1945779	1949061	It almost wants me to buy it, but my mind goes like, don't buy it.
1949161	1949781	It's junk.
1950161	1951021	Don't buy it.
1951081	1952122	Don't fall for it.
1952622	1954883	I've never seen the commercial, but I don't watch TV.
1954923	1955443	What's it like?
1957383	1960164	It's, they're doing a disco one, and they're like doing the Wii mode.
1960204	1961725	It has nothing to do with the game.
1961905	1963566	No gameplay footage whatsoever.
1963986	1965926	But the commercials, I think it was great.
1966046	1967227	You know, I'm like, wow.
1967527	1968287	That looks like fun.
1968327	1970648	And then I smack myself going like, shit, it's not fun.
1971286	1981752	But they do show you how to actually play the game in the commercial because they do have the Wiimote and the Nunchuck moving back and forth and what I assume is how you're supposed to play that piece of crap game.
1983653	1986655	And then I smack myself and then... I can rent it for free.
1986875	1988236	Yeah, renting might be a thing to do.
1988496	1995680	RossDealUT says, Problem is that most people are just buying it as a Wii Sports machine and will never buy anything for it.
1995720	1996800	Well, what about Wii Play, though?
1996820	1997901	Because Wii Play's been selling a lot.
1998368	2000449	And how come the PlayStation 2 is still selling?
2001010	2002931	Gold Banjo, I think same reason, actually.
2002971	2005632	Gold Banjo says, my little sister sings along during that commercial.
2005913	2010715	I think the PlayStation 2 continues to sell because they're A, cheap, and B, there's a shitload of games for it.
2011456	2013777	I mean, just massive and massive amounts of games for it.
2014758	2015898	So, all right.
2015978	2016419	One more thing.
2016699	2017960	Of course, one more thing, sir.
2019501	2027045	You know, the new release of Bioshock came out, and I was just wondering, do you think this game's going to be buried like Dead Rising when it came out, when the first...
2027571	2032295	Dead Rising is one of those games that everyone loved, played, you know, Loki loved it, I loved it.
2032715	2037198	Is Bioshock going to fall under that, like, we love it and we leave it for, like, another game?
2037559	2042943	I'm going to take a very controversial stance here, and I'm going to say yes, it will fall off the radar.
2043393	2043953	Death Rising
2070214	2072235	I think the lack of multiplayer is really going to hurt the game.
2072375	2078817	But at the same time, I think Bioshock will trump Halo 3 on some end-of-year best list.
2079618	2082999	So I think you may see a small resurgence come the end of the year during award times.
2084039	2087860	Yeah, I'm just saying that because, you know, this game has, you know, everyone loved it.
2087921	2089141	You know, it's like, you know.
2089721	2090222	DOOM DOOM DOOM
2111693	2113714	My hand is raised because we were playing it recently.
2113874	2116476	Well, okay, so one person on the entire internet is playing it.
2116516	2116996	No, I'm just kidding.
2117396	2118837	I'm the most important person on the internet.
2119717	2127641	But if I look at my friends list, I do not see people playing a lot of the old arcade releases except for a few big, big biggies like Geometry Wars.
2128082	2130503	Pac-Man Championship Edition still comes up.
2131203	2132584	So, a couple of those.
2133788	2134549	Thank you for watching!
2159063	2162446	Ross Steel UT says lots of people play games and don't go on live.
2162746	2170731	That's true, but I'm using the rationalization that you have to go on live to get the game in the first place unless it was on that arcade unplugged disc.
2170811	2172773	But I truly think that's a minority.
2173393	2173913	One more comment.
2174113	2177436	You would think with a mall that's so big would have more bathrooms.
2177616	2178036	No.
2178697	2178997	All right.
2179637	2180638	Raven's off and we've got to let you go.
2180678	2181639	But have a good one, buddy, okay?
2181859	2182119	You too.
2182159	2182359	Bye.
2182499	2182739	All right.
2183300	2185321	Again, if you want to give us a call, our number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2188968	2192290	1-877-GAME-OLR Orange Lounge Radio 1-877-GAME-OLR Orange Lounge Radio
2219988	2222309	Loki, do you have any last minute stories while I change this real quick here?
2222569	2223370	Yes, I do.
2223430	2223850	Thank you.
2223890	2224610	Give us one real quick.
2224830	2225951	Okay, real quick.
2227391	2235015	There's some interesting things coming out about the brand new Brain Age 2 DS, the one that, you know, red and black, whatever.
2235355	2240137	Apparently, the LCD screen's a little bit dimmer than the normal DS Lite.
2240817	2241377	Uh-oh.
2242097	2243218	That sucks for people that bought it.
2245659	2246199	Let's see.
2246319	2247860	Enter interesting things.
2249789	2255250	Um, there was a PSP petition for Resident Evil coming onto the PSP.
2255630	2265252	It got the attention of Capcom, who says if you get over 10,000 signatures, that will draw significant attention.
2266252	2273454	And now they're up to 17,000 signatures, so maybe we'll see a PSP version of Resident Evil.
2274334	2276575	Hold on, I fixed Skype, so save the rest for a little later.
2276615	2276995	Alrighty.
2277515	2277775	Okay.
2277975	2278495	Can you do that?
2279247	2280248	GS68 Game Boy Color Games
2300316	2301377	Black and White Mario Bros.
2323627	2324488	On the big screen TV?
2324788	2325928	Yeah, it just wouldn't look good.
2326389	2335373	I would actually like to see them port crappy Metroid 2 from Game Boy onto the virtual console because that game was a pain to play on the original Game Boy.
2335854	2338695	I think actually playing it on TV would make it a worthwhile experience.
2338715	2342117	Or how about they do a Metroid All-Stars where they just redesign the game?
2342517	2343438	Yeah, that would be good too.
2343458	2344158	Upgrade the graphics.
2344318	2347260	Oh, and Kid Icarus on Game Boy, even though I'm not sure if it's...
2347952	2350254	Well, I don't really know a lot of good Game Boy games.
2350294	2352716	Like, there are the games that I grew up with, and that's about it.
2378000	2379000	What got you thinking about this?
2380961	2382921	I don't know, just randomly, I guess.
2383161	2383661	That's all good.
2384341	2401125	You know what would actually be really cool, though, would be, like, even though the DS doesn't play the old, old Game Boy games, it would be kind of cool if, like, there was that functionality between the DS and the Wii a little later on, which we all know there is some functionality there, where maybe you could download a virtual console game from the Game Boy and play it on your DS.
2401605	2402405	Wouldn't that be kind of neat?
2403271	2407796	If Mr. Spankin wins the list list, I'll make videos of myself killing patients in trauma center.
2423132	2428174	All right, so if Mr. Spanky wins Listless, you're going to kill patients in trauma centers and put it on the YouTubes.
2428474	2430215	Well, we're going to find out very soon what won.
2431275	2437758	Just out of curiosity, can you describe your hatred of Mr. Spanky to the listeners who may not be familiar with the character?
2438798	2440579	Well, I heard his voice.
2444318	2450022	on a large media presence ago, and, well, I didn't really like it.
2450503	2451363	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
2451444	2453425	Although, you know that wasn't the official voice, right?
2453445	2455847	That was just some idiot pretending, right?
2457308	2457628	Yeah.
2457969	2461531	I am noticing there is no article on Mr. Spanky on Wikipedia.
2461551	2465875	I was hoping for some pictures or something, like an article I could refer people to, but there's nothing.
2465935	2466795	Did you spell it with an E?
2467636	2468416	I did it both ways.
2468717	2471519	I did it once with an E and once with no E. Yeah, DDRPC.
2471819	2472940	DDRPC, let me see.
2475819	2478261	No, there's no DDR PC article either.
2478301	2481863	There's just a Dance Dance Revolution main article.
2482704	2485045	How is there no Mr. Spanky article on Wikipedia?
2485345	2486926	He's an important part of the culture.
2487867	2489428	Well, he's a DDR character.
2489468	2492410	They don't really deserve their own Wikipedia articles.
2492690	2493190	I don't get it.
2493631	2493931	All right.
2494852	2495512	I'm sick of looking.
2495592	2496152	Wait, no, I'm not.
2496232	2496693	Windows PC.
2496933	2499935	Yeah, there's no article for the Windows PC version of Dance Dance Revolution.
2500015	2500515	Sadness.
2501676	2501936	All right.
2502477	2503037	Anyway, I'm done.
2503984	2505585	Anything else you want to share with us, GS68?
2505605	2507265	No, I'm good.
2508406	2510007	All right, well, have a good one, GS68.
2510027	2510767	We'll talk to you next time.
2511707	2512267	Thanks, you too.
2512668	2513188	Bye-bye.
2514528	2520371	I'm hoping one of our Wikipedia faithful will somehow create that Mr. Spanky article.
2520391	2521411	That would be all kinds of awesome.
2521791	2522671	Let's go to another call.
2522731	2523692	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2523712	2524072	Who's this?
2525072	2526433	Hey, guys, it's Insanist.
2526873	2528374	Hello, Insanist.
2528434	2529214	What is on your mind?
2530921	2538425	I don't know if you guys know, but that Penny Arcade Expo thing went on, and if you can tell, I have absolutely no voice from being at it all weekend.
2539186	2539766	Oh, wow.
2539846	2541868	I think Penny Arcade Expo should happen more often.
2541908	2542668	It kills your voice.
2543849	2544850	Yeah, fuck you too, buddy.
2544950	2545190	All right.
2545683	2546523	PENNY ARCADE EXPO
2569298	2570658	I went to the wedding on Saturday.
2570698	2572259	So congratulations, Amanda and Tom.
2572319	2573279	Wave, wave, wave, hug.
2573579	2575019	Although I know they don't listen to this program.
2575279	2576999	But they got married, so I had to go.
2578060	2579340	Well, how was Penny Arcade Expo?
2579360	2579980	So you were there.
2580020	2581300	You were our man on the street.
2581340	2582080	What's going on?
2583480	2588261	Well, what was really disappointing was Sony really didn't bring much to the show.
2590062	2596923	In fact, it was something outside of Sony's boot that was for the PlayStation 3, which I gave the unofficial OLR seal of approval.
2597323	2598703	It's this game called Eye of Judgment.
2599604	2602165	It's a collectible card game that works with the PS3.
2602285	2606005	Wait a minute, you gave the OLR award to the Eye of Judgment?
2606625	2606865	Yes.
2607245	2607645	FIRED!
2608986	2609646	Have you played it?
2610046	2610646	No, I haven't.
2611106	2613707	I saw the tech demo and I was like, why?
2613767	2616507	We did kind of see it at E3, so I'm curious.
2616947	2618927	So you're being completely serious.
2619107	2619908	This game is awesome.
2620408	2622928	Okay, I won't give it the OLR, I'll give it the STFU.
2623308	2624168	I'll leave that for you guys.
2624208	2626169	No, no, that's fine, but I'm just curious.
2626249	2627249	You're absolutely serious.
2627289	2627929	This game rocked.
2629153	2630074	I thoroughly enjoyed it.
2630114	2637297	I'm a huge CCG fan and obviously I'm a huge video game fan and this was a very good combination of the two.
2637537	2642479	It felt more interactive to me than just putting a piece of cardboard on a table.
2642539	2649942	I could actually see what was going on and I thought the technology was good and it was something different, which I'm always welcome to seeing.
2652043	2652903	The graphics were great.
2652923	2655084	There weren't any glitches with reading the cards.
2656212	2657113	I had no problem with it.
2657273	2659734	And really, Sony didn't bring much else to the table.
2660755	2661716	Oh, so I get it.
2661876	2666639	So you're giving the award to Eye of Judgment by default because there were no other games there.
2667139	2668741	There was nothing new from Sony there.
2669041	2669441	I see.
2670402	2672923	But was Eye of Judgment the best thing you saw on any system?
2674124	2674324	No.
2676286	2677126	I'll be getting to that.
2677507	2682230	But my Wii award goes to Metroid Prime 3.
2682530	2685532	This game's amazing and you need to all pick it up next week.
2686024	2686624	Why?
2687725	2690807	One, it has the best Wii remote controls I've ever seen.
2691288	2696491	The looking is fantastic, the shooting is fantastic, the motion controls are very intuitive and a lot of fun.
2697352	2698993	But I didn't like Prime 1 and 2.
2699133	2700054	Well, I take that back.
2700094	2704777	I kind of like Prime 2, the multiplayer mode, but I found first-person Metroid so hard to play.
2704837	2707219	Am I going to suddenly get over it with number 3?
2707379	2708260	Will it bring me back?
2709180	2709781	I think it will.
2710261	2714444	The motion controls really make you feel like a part of the game and some of the boss battles are amazing.
2715431	2717772	I got to demo the Ridley boss battle.
2719092	2724033	I'm not going to spoil too much, but it was one of the coolest boss battles I've ever fought.
2724653	2724833	Ever.
2725513	2726453	Did you get a rise out of it?
2727694	2729314	Yes, yes I did, and not down there.
2729554	2731574	Did it make you feel excited in a special place?
2733095	2733595	Sometimes.
2734115	2737116	Did you have to go back to your hotel room and take care of some business after playing the demo?
2738516	2740876	No, because I had to go run tournaments, unfortunately.
2741116	2741396	I see.
2741776	2743657	Alright, so how about your Xbox 360 award?
2745278	2747539	and overall award, Rock Band.
2748079	2750499	No question, this game is amazing.
2750919	2754600	And yes, I know everybody in the chat room is like, hey, I've played this before.
2754640	2755940	It's Guitar Freaks Drum Mania.
2757061	2760241	And you're right, it is Guitar Freaks Drum Mania and Karaoke Revolution.
2760602	2763222	But it's with songs that the mainstream people are going to know.
2763542	2766763	And that's going to sell a lot of copies and make Harmonix a lot of money.
2767983	2769043	The interface is great.
2769584	2770604	The controllers are great.
2771872	2776693	The guitars for Rock Band feel like real guitars.
2777633	2782794	The fret buttons are colored on the top of the controller, rather, on the buttons themselves.
2784234	2786114	But it's the same layout as guitar here.
2786194	2787235	Here's my question for you.
2787275	2790635	Do you think if Rock Band does well, there'll be a pop band that comes out?
2791035	2798497	Because, you know, I like shitty music, and there's just not a lot... I mean, Rock Band actually has a lot of good music in it, but I like shitty music.
2798577	2801017	So is there any hope for me in my love of pop music?
2801736	2804917	If you would have brought me that question, I would have asked the Harmonix guys.
2805357	2805777	Damn you.
2806438	2810939	But with them releasing Guitar Hero 80s, anything can happen.
2811139	2812940	So, actually, I honestly wouldn't rule that out.
2813000	2816181	I mean, a lot of the songs in Guitar Hero 80s weren't that great.
2816781	2822022	But, you know, I think pop band could very well be a viable idea.
2822082	2827424	Going to comments from the chat room here, Zaku says, Excuse me, sir, but Harmonix fucked up the drums.
2827524	2828004	Nuff said.
2828925	2829725	Have you used them?
2831497	2833159	Oh, wait, you can't respond in time.
2833279	2834179	No, you didn't.
2834660	2835561	They're great.
2835601	2836681	They're very responsive.
2837002	2841986	My only beef is the Xbox button is in the way of the rightmost two drums.
2842166	2842807	Damn that Xbox button.
2842827	2844768	And that got annoying a couple of times.
2844848	2847170	TigerClaw says, Rob, don't give them any ideas.
2847230	2849192	Next thing you know, there will be a game called Boy Band.
2850653	2852675	Miklatov got all excited over there.
2853636	2855557	I think that's called SingStar, actually.
2855577	2857079	Yeah, it is probably called SingStar.
2857099	2858440	That would be so much fun.
2859039	2859619	Halo 3 is the final.
2883844	2885004	They showed two new maps.
2886105	2890046	One was called Narrows, which is a hallway with vehicles, and it was a hell of a lot of fun.
2891026	2897848	The other one was called Guardian, which looked very base-like and showed off jump pads and elevators and was really cool.
2898708	2899428	Some new weapons.
2899988	2901608	A flamethrower will be in the game.
2903549	2904869	Fire grenades will be in the game.
2905729	2907350	A Spartan laser will be in the game.
2907810	2910871	And this item called the Gravity Hammer, which is the sword on steroids.
2911651	2911891	Huh.
2913086	2913446	Wow.
2914087	2915208	How did Halo 3 look?
2915268	2917490	Because a lot of people complained the beta didn't look that much better.
2917510	2919251	It looked really good.
2919571	2919832	Did it?
2920112	2921233	It looked very good.
2921253	2925216	What I was most impressed with was the heads-up display.
2925816	2927918	It got a big overhaul from Halo 2.
2929700	2936165	The shield meter is directly top-center on the screen, so you'll be seeing it at all times.
2936505	2936705	Wow.
2937802	2943163	They have your weapons and ammo in the upper right corner, and it has icons and the button.
2943203	2945724	Instead of saying, press this button to pick up this now.
2946624	2954185	They streamlined it a lot, and I really, really think this will get rid of the disappointment that, at least in my opinion, was Halo 2.
2954925	2955246	Let's see.
2955546	2956966	Gold Banjo says, yay fire.
2957046	2959586	GS68, though, asks, any word on the man cannon?
2961127	2967088	I did not see a man cannon, but there is a fire cannon that you could...
2968161	2971642	It was mounted, but you could yank it out and run after people with it, which is pretty cool.
2971922	2972222	All right.
2972522	2977684	Well, anything else you want to share from Penny Arcade Expo since you were lucky enough to go?
2977764	2978184	Two things.
2978384	2981545	One, the frag doll stole a flowchart about boobs that I made.
2982865	2986046	And two, Wil Wheaton kicked my ass at Guitar Hero.
2986646	2987907	You poor thing.
2988787	2989647	That was pretty cool.
2989667	2990668	He's a good sport about it.
2991128	2991288	Wow.
2992196	2993096	But that's about it.
2993316	2994597	Penny Arcade Expo is great.
2994677	2995737	I wish you guys were there.
2996097	2998358	Wait, how the hell did you end up playing Guitar Hero with Will Wheaton?
2998378	2999158	Was it just by chance?
2999739	3001819	Well, Matt and he entered the tournament beforehand.
3001839	3005861	He was in there warming up and asked if I could get a game with him because I'm probably not going to get a chance to play.
3005901	3006621	And he's like, sure.
3006681	3010082	And we played Let's Talk More Rock Expert and he kicked my ass.
3010342	3010862	Wow.
3012343	3012763	Something else.

3055722	3058083	I won't be here next Sunday because of something very special.
3058903	3061665	Hey, Rob, can I have one more request?
3062445	3064986	Well, let Jamie finish your thought and then you can have your turn.
3065086	3065547	Yes, Jamie.
3065647	3067728	It's the weekend of my second wedding anniversary.
3068108	3069088	Well, congratulations.
3069348	3070269	Yay, Jamie.
3070509	3074051	I will be making Dan buy me expensive food on Saturday.
3074531	3075992	He's taking me to Weird Al on Sunday.
3076012	3076712	All right.
3077375	3081057	It should be an interesting show Sunday because Labor Day weekend and everything.
3081117	3081737	So we'll see.
3082077	3083538	I'll be here if we do a drunk show.
3084619	3085299	Hmm.
3086199	3086960	Hmm.
3087960	3088681	Maybe.
3088721	3090561	You know, I don't have any plans for Monday.
3092863	3093503	The plot thickens.
3093543	3094844	All right, DM, what was your one more thought?
3096364	3097785	You haven't hung up on me in a while.
3098205	3098645	You're right.
3098886	3099706	So I should do that now.
3102250	3112258	DMN goes by Insanus now.
3112318	3112798	I don't know why.
3112978	3114299	Why did Prince change his name?
3114339	3114839	He just did.
3115420	3118382	No, he did because his name was copyrighted by the label he was on before.
3118682	3120404	Do you always have to know everything?
3120724	3120924	Yes.
3122352	3126516	DMN slash Insanus slash whatever your name is going to be tomorrow.
3127316	3134522	If you don't sign on to WoW, I'm going to get somebody to kick you out of the guild because you're being too inactive and I don't like that.
3135103	3135483	Thank you.
3136724	3138165	Alright, well I'd like to go to another call now.
3139226	3141528	You can use your WoW guild chat some other time.
3141548	3146412	Wait, you can't kick him from the guild because you don't have WoW.
3146992	3148193	You had to cancel WoW.
3148714	3150055	Alright, we've got to go back to the phones.
3150095	3151036	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3151056	3151396	Who's this?
3152256	3152996	Hey, it's AZHP!
3179025	3179365	I'm there.
3206281	3207742	I just don't play that much.
3207803	3210144	Speaking of people who leveled to level 5 and then quit.
3210405	3212727	No, I got to 8 with my team and then I started.
3212747	3213047	Sorry, 8.
3214949	3215749	Okay, okay, okay.
3215949	3218732	I will play World of Warcraft on Sunday.
3220473	3222375	Alright, and DMN sent me a private message.
3222655	3223936	Tell me Glotov I quit WoW.
3225377	3226478	Then I'm sad.
3227619	3227859	Alright.
3228140	3230782	Anyway, sorry, AZHP has been waiting on the line very patiently.
3230802	3231462	You poor bastard.
3231482	3232023	What's on your mind?
3232043	3233284	Yeah.
3233795	3242801	Speaking of WoW, you know, after I got off the phone last week with you guys, you said that I might have bought this budget computer for WoW, and no, I'm not a WoW player.
3243441	3243741	Really?
3244261	3250625	Oh, because that's right, you emailed us, and we said something about you had the budget... You said something about buying a budget computer, right?
3251346	3259191	Yeah, well, I Skyped in last week, and I said that I bought a budget computer, and you thought that it was for WoW, and no, I've seen what WoW does to my friends, and I...
3260518	3262679	I don't want to become a recovering WoW addict.
3263000	3265681	Ironic that we're yelling about WoW the minute you call in.
3265721	3267222	That's why you were snickering to yourself.
3267662	3268763	Is that all you wanted to say?
3269564	3269844	No.
3271425	3274427	Well, I didn't catch the mailbag this week.
3274887	3276208	You guys read my email?
3277529	3278209	I don't know.
3278229	3278509	Maybe.
3278769	3282972	We read a lot of emails, so I don't know if we – I think I heard your name come up.
3283772	3284332	Alright, awesome.
3284412	3285073	Well, yeah.
3285173	3289095	You know, you could always just download Part A, and then you'll find out.
3290376	3291437	Well, yeah.
3292057	3296980	I played the Bioshock demo, and I was looking at picking it up because it's so awesome, right?
3297160	3298201	Oh yeah, we read this email, yeah.
3299142	3312650	Yeah, and I just read a lot of controversy on the forums, like, oh, if you buy the game, you can only register it on two computers, and after that, your CD won't work anymore on any other computers that you have.
3313217	3317380	That and your computer will be reported to the Motion Picture Association of America.
3317440	3320402	Why they do that, I don't know, but it's just more negative stuff to happen.
3321323	3328628	And little gnomes will come live inside your computer, and if you don't feed them before midnight, then your computer will grow legs and walk away.
3328988	3331129	I mean, the coffee protection on Bioshock is just that bad.
3332410	3337994	Yeah, actually, people have said that root kits were installed, like Sony's old root kits that
3338439	3340861	and pretty much just monitored everything on your computer.
3341341	3349407	So I'm thinking of waiting until that stuff gets all settled down, people start throwing lawsuits at 2K and stuff, more lawsuits.
3350127	3355931	Yes, actually Big Brother is watching your computer and sending daily reports to Amber who's crying about them right now.
3357012	3357853	Bad joke, sorry.
3358113	3359654	If you get that, you need a life like I do.
3359994	3360955	See, Miklatov's booing me.
3360995	3361455	I know he needs it.
3361475	3361715	All right.
3363176	3364737	Anything else you want to share, ACHP?
3367018	3371002	Probably, but it all got lost in the randomness, so I guess that's about it.
3371262	3375807	That's like the tagline of this show, it all gets lost in the randomness, so there you go.
3376447	3377348	That is pretty excellent.
3377508	3379210	Oh, actually, one more thing.
3379390	3379590	Yes.
3380491	3390260	Yeah, about the Wii outselling the Xbox 360, and you guys are all wondering, oh, it's not the hardcore gamers who's buying all the stuff for it, it's just Wii Sports, Wii Play.
3390340	3391862	Well, it's a mix, it's a mix.
3392648	3395029	I mean, keep in mind we were reading some chat comments there too.
3395149	3396089	I think it's a mix.
3396109	3401030	I think you've got both the hardcore gamers and soccer moms buying it, and that's why it's doing so well.
3401470	3405191	But I think for a lot of hardcore gamers, the magic is dying off.
3405751	3409332	And hopefully Metroid is going to bring that back, and Super Smash Bros.
3409412	3410632	certainly will bring that back.
3410732	3414653	But I feel like it's the DS launch all over again.
3414693	3414933	Really.
3415674	3416834	It's the DS launch all over again.
3416854	3421455	You had a bunch of great games at the beginning, and then like a year of deadness with the occasional gem.
3422091	3423772	and now we're going to get back into Overdrive.
3424312	3430135	Yeah, I mean like from next week until four months from now we got like great releases coming every month.
3430435	3438939	You got Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Brothers, you got Battalion Wars, everything's just like coming out one after another.
3438959	3441000	Well, it's about freaking time, right?
3441080	3442281	Yeah, definitely.
3442481	3442761	Alright.
3443775	3446836	I haven't bought a new game for my Wii since Elevates.
3447136	3450617	I mean, the last one I bought was Super Paper Mario and I barely played it.
3450657	3453478	I feel like a dummy for even buying it because I barely played it.
3454358	3454598	Oh, well.
3455218	3456859	All right, well, ACHP, thanks so much for the call.
3456879	3458199	We've got to go and wrap things up, okay?
3458899	3459379	All right, then.
3459439	3460199	All right, later, sir.
3460980	3461200	Bye.
3461680	3461940	All right.
3462240	3463640	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
3463660	3465721	If you didn't get through, so sorry, but try again next week.
3465741	3468982	We had some long calls tonight that kind of took up all our time.
3469062	3473103	So if you're mad we didn't get to your call, just blame Insanus because his call went on for about nine minutes.
3474051	3474391	Just kidding.
3475352	3479433	Let's get to the listless results, shall we, before we get to the last-minute stories.
3479453	3481114	Because you still had some last-minute stories, right, Loki?
3481494	3481674	Yes.
3482114	3484835	And maybe DarkSakura has a few as well?
3485475	3485795	You know.
3486095	3486335	All right.
3486716	3487056	You know.
3488096	3488376	All right.
3489316	3491077	Let's get to tonight's listless results.
3491157	3502221	In third place for the character we would most like to see in the new track and field game, Dracula is the character that people would like to see third most in their DDR games.
3502828	3511717	In second place for character that we most want to see in track and field, Mr. Spanky comes in second place.
3512438	3514359	And what could possibly top Mr. Spanky?
3514620	3523608	For the number one character you most want to see in track and field on the DS, the left DDR arrow is the number one.
3524409	3524930	Yay.
3525550	3527212	So make it happen, Konami.
3528081	3529222	Heart, Hearts Make It Better
3556581	3557682	Don't throw napkins at me.
3557702	3558803	That will just make me meaner.
3558863	3559363	Yes, Mikotov.
3560143	3568108	I realized like 10 minutes ago that it would have been better to do the right DDR arrow because it's pointing in the direction of like the running on the screen.
3568468	3571290	The lefty arrow makes even less sense now that I think about it.
3571310	3572371	It makes you run away.
3572711	3574012	But it makes it funnier.
3574752	3576593	Anyway, Loki, last minute stories.
3577094	3577554	Anyways.
3579012	3579452	Let's see.
3580052	3587657	So there was some other stuff other than the Eye of Judgment announced for the PlayStation Eye.
3588638	3597924	One of which is the Towers of Topok, which is apparently a game where you roll around this giant ball down this tower using your body.
3598085	3599606	Sounds like a shitload of fun.
3599626	3601007	Hurrah.
3601047	3601507	Hurrah.
3602689	3628569	I will use the eye of judgment to roll a giant ball down a hill is what you're saying something like that you know hooray that sounds like totem ball I love totem ball it's not exactly a totem ball and basically it's a top-down view and each of the little platforms that you're on is actually an image of your screen so you actually are on multiple platforms there I don't know it's weird not something I would buy though um
3629967	3630567	Let's see here.
3631107	3650312	Also, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, which is rumored to be out this year, according to an interview with some people working the Sony booth at Leipzig, that actually, I guess, with the series creator, Kazunori Yamauchi,
3652964	3654205	has confirmed himself.
3654245	3660250	He said that, yes, it will be a free download on the PSN, and we're thinking of charging, but doubt it.
3660670	3661631	For now, it's free.
3662592	3666095	So, I think it was actually supposed to contain quite a bit of stuff.
3666475	3673721	They were saying, I want to say it was like quite a few cars and about 16 tracks or something like that.
3673741	3675562	I think it was like 50 cars.
3675962	3677784	So, that would be pretty sweet if it was free.
3678865	3680506	Then I wouldn't have to buy the actual game.
3681207	3681607	Ha ha ha.
3682455	3685777	Anyways, let's see.
3685937	3690439	Other than that, there was one other thing.
3690499	3696221	I was going to say that they've partially cracked the Xbox 360 kernel.
3696962	3702924	Now that allows you to download or downgrade from any kernel without using a computer key.
3703705	3704305	It's possible.
3704365	3710248	So what that will allow you to do is drop your firmware, I guess, down to a level where you can...
3712110	3713111	I don't think I have a choice
3741741	3744522	Well, I'm glad you have such enthusiasm with this program.
3745183	3747884	Maybe I'll lift my ban on drinking for myself.
3748904	3750385	That would be fun.
3751286	3753347	I think we might have to do a drunk show after all.
3754047	3755368	So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
3755408	3756308	Migletov, your final thought.
3758149	3758649	I don't know.
3760410	3761230	Loki, your final thought.
3762831	3770935	My final thought is they had some people, I guess, at Leipzig that were just completely naked, except they were painted on.
3771704	3773285	That's what we need to see at E3.
3773845	3774726	Painted chicks.
3774786	3775566	They're topless.
3777007	3781249	My final thought is Mike and Ike's are yummy and I just found one left in the bag.
3781790	3782270	Delicious.
3783851	3784871	DarkSakura, your final thought.
3784991	3785492	Gross.
3786632	3787533	You don't like Mike and Ike's?
3788113	3791295	They're one of the candies I can't eat because I'm allergic to one of the ingredients.
3792315	3793696	It's like the gelatin something something.
3793716	3797118	Same with Starburst and gum makes me nauseous when I smell it.
3798739	3800560	I'm trying to figure out what the name of the ingredient would be.
3801989	3805710	It's some... Jamie Repellent.
3805930	3806851	Oh, look, it's right in there.
3806871	3808091	Jamie Repellent number five.
3808151	3808471	Who knew?
3809572	3809872	All right.
