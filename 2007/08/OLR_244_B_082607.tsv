15480	19960	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19960	24520	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, August the 26th of 2007, where
24520	28620	we're taping Orange Lounge Radio live and this is the second half of our show, part
28620	29620	B.
29620	32760	We'll be right back into some gaming news from the one and only, Loki.
32760	33760	Yes.
33760	39120	Well, Metroid Prime 3 is coming out this week and one interesting thing on it is that they're
39120	44200	going to have kind of like a in-game sort of like achievements.
44200	47800	They're going to have like a token feature that you unlock different things as you're
47800	49280	playing the game.
49280	52800	And I don't know, I've seen this done in games before.
52800	57000	It's not a huge deal, I mean it's not like achievements are coming to the Wii or anything
57000	58000	like that.
58000	63240	In fact, they did something similar with Resistance where it had its kind of own achievement system
63240	68440	and I think there was even something like that sort of on Excite Truck a little bit
68440	69440	as well.
69440	71920	So, I don't know, it's kind of neat.
71920	76840	Apparently the tokens that you can earn in the game are in four different tiers, red,
76840	78920	blue, green, and gold.
78920	84720	Red tokens are gained by scanning enemies and items, blue for scanning lore and completing
84720	86120	side quests.
86120	89760	Green ones you get from friends.
89760	94160	And gold is achieved from defeating bosses on various difficulties.
94160	97720	What is different from this and like the trophies that you earn in Burnout?
97720	99320	I think nothing.
99320	100320	Nothing?
100320	101520	Absolutely nothing.
101520	103920	So what is so noteworthy about this?
103920	104920	I think people...
104920	105920	Is it the fact that it's the first time in a Metroid game?
105920	106920	I guess.
106920	110120	People are thinking, oh my god, achievements are coming.
110120	111120	No.
111120	112120	No.
112120	115520	Alright, well one other thing that people would like to see coming to the Wii any day
115520	123560	now is online play and also demos for the Wii and there's actually a new survey that's
123560	129320	gone out from Nintendo that seems to indicate a little bit that there could be some actual
129320	132440	Wii demos coming out in the near future.
132440	138360	Nintendo actually submitted out this survey and on it are some different types of questions
138360	141240	on it and they seem to point towards the...
141240	146280	All signs, you could say, point to the fact that they're at least exploring the possibility
146280	148120	of doing downloadable demos.
148120	155320	Of course to date all we've really seen come from them would be the Metroid Prime 3 preview
155320	156640	channel.
156640	160360	Some of the things here, please indicate your level of interest in playable demo versions
160360	161460	of Wii games.
161460	165020	What is your preferred method of receiving Wii game demos?
165020	168480	Would you be willing to pay more for your subscription in order to receive Wii game
168480	169480	demos?
169480	171360	Kind of interesting there.
171360	174920	It would be kind of cool if Nintendo Power did have Wii game demos.
174920	178660	But what the other big three consoles do for their magazines.
178660	185000	But I would like to see the Wii actually able to download things other than virtual console
185000	187820	titles and a few crappy titles.
187820	191200	They're supposed to have original software, at least we know about that Mission Impossible
191200	192200	thing, right?
192200	195000	Well yeah, they're supposed to go online someday too.
195000	197700	Come on, the console's been out for almost a year now.
197700	201400	Time to start following through with that shit you've been promising us for a while
201400	202400	now.
202400	203400	Alright.
203400	206720	Or we're going to have to start calling you Sony.
206720	208200	Ooh, burn.
208200	209200	Wow.
209200	211400	Well, how about some happy Nintendo news?
211400	212960	How does that sound?
212960	213960	Sounds good to me.
213960	216980	Well, guess what is back for Super Mario Galaxy?
216980	218960	We have fire flowers!
218960	220960	And superstars!
220960	225020	I love the fire flowers so much because they're like burning things.
225020	227800	We're just happy that Mario can set fire to things again.
227800	232480	Well, you know, the fire flower was such a great weapon and then we just didn't get it.
232480	236000	We had him squirt shit with water.
236000	237000	Boo.
237000	238840	What is so wrong with Mario Sunshine?
238840	240160	It wasn't that bad of a game.
240160	241160	Jesus.
241160	242160	I loved Mario Sunshine.
242160	243160	What?
243160	244160	It is not the worst game ever.
244160	245760	But I could not play that game and drink anything.
245760	249540	It's the worst Mario game by far, it is so freaking terrible.
249540	251960	We need, we need another game that's just like Mario 64.
251960	254560	Did you play like Mario is Missing?
254560	261200	Mario is Missing is a great game, I have all those MP3s.
261200	265280	I liked it on Nintendo because they totally recreated the Super Nintendo graphics on the
265280	266280	Nintendo.
266280	268720	Going to chat room for some comments at chat.orangelandrater.com.
268720	273800	RossdielUT says, Loki, stop wishing and relying on Nintendo's word.
273800	276400	Shadow Charlie says, Tanooki suit.
276400	277400	That would be a great thing to come back with.
277400	278400	No, no, no.
278400	279400	Hammer Brother suit.
279400	280400	That would be pretty rad.
280400	282400	Or the Kuriboh's boot.
282400	284000	Yes, Kuriboh's shoe.
284000	285000	That's awesome.
285000	286000	Yeah, that was it.
286000	290800	But in other news, we do have a release date for the UK on this.
290800	292680	It will be November 16th.
292680	294320	Oh right.
294320	296000	Not soon enough, right?
296000	297000	Not soon enough.
297000	298000	Alrighty.
298000	299000	Anyways.
299000	305720	I do want to know who this new hoochie in the game is though, sorry.
305720	310880	Anyways, interesting news, and we knew this was kind of coming, but finally the Wii has
310880	315080	passed the Xbox 360 in worldwide sales.
315080	320560	Now the last screenshot that we've seen of this was of course a few days ago with the
320560	329720	Wii having approximately 10.57 million units worldwide and the Xbox 360 having 10.51 million
329720	330720	units.
330720	337080	Of course the PS3 still trailing behind with 4.32 million units.
337080	344060	It should be known though that still the 360 is outselling the Wii in the US, but apparently
344060	349680	Japan is where they're making up for a lot of slack.
349680	353260	So what does this mean for Nintendo fanboys?
353260	357020	Is this something additional for them to brag about or is this really not the big deal it
357020	358280	seems like?
358280	365720	I guess it's fuel for flame fodder I guess because the Wii has basically caught up to
365720	369680	the 360 in half the time.
369680	375780	So I don't know, I mean that's really good and I think if they could produce more units
375780	380320	it would be even higher, but hopefully that means more support.
380320	381320	Better games!
381320	385520	Alright well some other bad news for the Xbox 360.
385520	388980	Mass Effect is a title that a lot of people have been looking forward to and Mass Effect
388980	392600	has been delayed to December 7th of this year.
392600	396840	Now it wasn't a huge push from where it was originally scheduled, but you know people
396840	400820	are chomping at the bit to get their hands on this game and so any delay I'm sure is
400820	402240	bad news for its fans.
402240	406280	Plus that means it's not going to be on shelves for the day after Thanksgiving madness so
406280	410120	that's kind of too bad, but I'm sure those people that have been very good boys and girls
410120	415760	this year that put this on their Christmas list, I'm sure Santa will find a way, right?
415760	416760	Sure.
416760	419840	Of course then again if you believe in Santa you probably should not be playing Mass Effect.
419840	420840	Come to think of it.
420840	422600	Why does Santa die in it?
422600	425960	I don't know, possibly.
425960	432400	Well for anyone who is at Penny Arcade Expo they did confirm that Penny Arcade Adventures
432400	438920	on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade in 2008.
438920	443420	It was also announced for PC, Mac OS X, and Linux.
443420	445600	So hey, game!
445600	446600	Cool.
446600	449160	That's kind of interesting.
449160	452320	Is that the console you guys would have guessed that this was going to be released on?
452320	453320	Yep.
453320	454880	I sort of thought so too.
454880	460900	Just because you know there's the, for a long time now there's been the little picture icons
460900	465800	and themes and all that stuff that you can download on Xbox Live so why not this?
465800	467400	Why not now their game on Xbox Live?
467400	468400	Why not?
468400	471200	If there's more money to be done, why not?
471200	476000	Well Penny Arcade Adventures isn't the only thing coming to Xbox Live soon.
476000	480920	There is a rumor of course with the fall update due out in November that it's possibly going
480920	484240	to include Xvid support.
484240	491640	Now some other plans from this leaked list, supposedly a new Xbox Live Arcade Blade, IPTV
491640	498600	support, integrated clan functionality, a picture in picture setting, and improved slideshow
498600	500600	effects.
500600	503500	That would be pretty awesome if it had Xvid codec support.
503500	505120	What exactly is Xvid?
505120	506380	It's kind of like Divx.
506380	513880	It's a video codec for encoding MPEG4 video so that you can rip a DVD and have it be a
513880	515920	decent file size.
515920	516920	It's pretty popular.
516920	519920	But you would still have to stream it.
519920	520920	Yeah.
520920	524240	Well I'm saying you still have to have it in WMV format, right?
524240	526040	I don't know about that.
526040	531320	I would imagine you would, but who knows?
531320	532320	Interesting.
532320	536360	Well, something that is definitive, I mean that's a rumor, but something definitive,
536360	540960	although it's been rumored about for quite some time, is that Microsoft is taking a pass
540960	543000	on going to E for All.
543000	546280	I know a lot of people were very hopeful that Microsoft was going to be attending the show.
546280	547280	I mean why not?
547280	551320	Nintendo's going to the show, but apparently Microsoft has just decided there's better
551320	552320	things to do.
552320	553700	They're not going to the show.
553700	557740	By the way, Sony is also not going to E for All.
557740	560600	There's also some other companies that have said they're not going, including Capcom and
560600	561600	so on.
561600	564960	Some of the companies that are going, though, would be Nintendo and Konami.
564960	567960	So it's not like it's going to be an empty show, but it is going to be a little bit of
567960	572800	a bummer that you don't have two of the big three showing up at E for All.
572800	576280	I don't know about you guys, but the fact that I'm actually kind of planning on going
576280	581160	to E for All because I got an invite and everything and I was planning the trip to go to L.A.,
581160	585360	I'm a little bit irritated that some of these companies are dropping out of E for All.
585360	587440	That news makes me a little bit angsty.
587440	588920	And when we get angsty, people die.
588920	594000	Oh, and the FUs of the week come out.
594000	603640	Oh, Dark Sakura, why don't you start us off with tonight's FUs?
603640	610000	Um, FU to my broken head, really, it still hurts.
610000	612560	You know, it happened, what, four hours ago?
612560	615560	But it's not four, why does it say four?
615560	618560	Three hours, two hours, whatever ago, and it still hurts.
618560	624600	And a secondary FU goes toward the art block, because I've been trying to draw and it's
624600	626880	just not working.
626880	628920	So instead of writer's block, it's art block?
628920	629920	It's art block.
629920	633920	Oh, I've been having a bit of writer's block, too, just in different capacities.
633920	636520	So FU to blocks of all shapes and sizes?
636520	639920	To the block of creativity, there we go.
639920	641920	All right, Loki, your FUs of the week.
641920	646760	My FUs of the week go to my cat for constantly waking me up in the middle of the night.
646760	650120	It's almost like having a goddamn baby, so.
650120	651560	Fuck you to the cat.
651560	655520	Just imagine when you really have a baby, imagine babies in your house.
655520	659480	Yeah, that's very funny.
659480	663120	I don't really have a lot to say FU to this week, I've actually had a pretty good week,
663120	668640	so FU to people who don't like caramel, because caramel ice cream is awesome.
668640	671600	But then again, maybe I shouldn't say FU to that, because that just means more for me,
671600	672600	right?
672600	673600	I don't know.
673600	677440	Miggletob, do you have any FUs of the week, while you're staring off into space over there?
677440	686240	FU to you for thinking about getting popsicles, because they are the worst.
686240	687240	Popsicles are awesome.
687240	690920	Here's the thing though, Miggletob, it wasn't that I was going to buy popsicles, I was going
690920	695160	to buy creamsicles, and those are awesome.
695160	699280	All right, let's end this segment now, shall we?
699280	702320	Are either of you guys, is anybody else in here thinking of going to E for All?
702320	703320	I was.
703320	705120	I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to go though.
705120	707320	It doesn't excite me as much anymore.
707320	708440	I would like to go.
708440	711440	I'd rather go to PAX, but that's kind of late for that.
711440	712760	It's a little bit over now.
712760	715740	What's in it for you to see at E for All?
715740	720320	I like Nintendo and Konami, and that's really all I remember that are actually going.
720320	725080	But not having E3 to go to this year, and going to Comic Con made me realize that I
725080	730240	kind of miss stuff like that, so going to E for All would be pretty cool.
730240	735640	Let's get back to some gaming news, now that the FUs of the week are over.
735640	739640	Well, you know, it was bound to happen.
739640	747240	For our buddies overseas, the Xbox 360 is getting a price drop in Europe, occurring
747240	751440	on the 24th of August.
751440	758000	It will be decreasing by 20 pounds on the core unit, and 30 on the 20 gigabyte 360,
758000	768400	it'll bring the price down respectively to $249.99, and I'm sorry, that's on the 20 gig,
768400	773300	and $179.99 on the core.
773300	775440	That's again in British pounds.
775440	779800	Also, the Elite will retail for $299.99.
779800	787160	All right, well, I just got to say real quickly for the live folks, it looks like our stream
787160	791760	is down, and I'm blaming Operator 11 for that, so at this time I'm going to shut this off
791760	795760	until we can work on this some other time, because it's probably taking a lot of bandwidth,
795760	798340	so we're going to have to get rid of this to get our stream back, so that's the end
798340	801880	of the Op 11 simulcast for now, until we can work on that a little later.
801880	802880	Sorry, guys.
802880	806080	All right, but in the meantime, we will go back to...
806080	807640	There was more news on that.
807640	809440	Oh, I'm sorry.
809440	817380	The Shizzle Games of Belgium was advertising by price from Elite down to Core, and Euros
817380	827120	as $449.99, $349.99, and $279.99 on their SKUs, and that's it.
827120	830320	Actually, no, my apologies.
830320	835640	Their Core was being called the Arcade, and then they have the Pro.
835640	838480	Very bizarre, but anyway.
838480	840280	That is kind of bizarre.
840280	842640	It's even more bizarre that they're called Shizzle Games.
842640	844120	Shizzle Games.
844120	851520	Well, the rumor, of course, of that new arcade SKU for the Core system is actually supposed
851520	859980	to be coming to the US as well, and same details, no definite launch date or anything like that,
859980	866500	but it is allegedly supposed to come out over here as well.
866500	867500	That's a good idea.
867500	873200	Hey, the Core system's not bad, but I know a lot of people complain that they can't save
873200	880240	their game, so now that that's going to be coming with a memory unit, that might be something
880240	884720	to actually look into if you're not into the whole live downloading thing.
884720	888920	Well, speaking of systems coming out in new shapes and sizes and all different types of
888920	893740	colors, the PSP Slim is going to be coming out in a variety of different colors over
893740	895200	there in Europe.
895200	901660	On September 5th, Simpsons Yellow and Spider-Man Black and Red will be some new designs that
901660	906400	are coming out for the PSP Slim over there in Europe, where, of course, when you talk
906400	911400	about colors, that's C-O-L-O-U-R-S, ha ha ha.
911400	912400	Just kidding.
912400	913400	By the way...
913400	914560	I bet you can't spell maneuver.
914560	919480	As a reminder, over here stateside, you get some Star Wars themed colors, but you don't
919480	922960	get the Simpsons or Spider-Man ones.
922960	925280	So there you have it.
925280	929880	Alright, well, moving on, Dark Soccer likes to surf the internet up and down and all around
929880	934620	every single week, and she likes to find a website that works for all of you, and it's
934620	938600	her website of the week that she's going to share with you guys right now.
938600	948240	Website of the week is actually suggested to me by Loki, and it's actually pretty cool.
948240	949880	It's Cult of Rapture.
949880	958960	If you go to 2KGames.com slash Cult of Rapture, all one word, it will take you to a Bioshock
958960	962280	page for the fans, I guess.
962280	969880	Talking about the music that's out, has downloads, articles, a forum, goodies for everybody.
969880	970880	It's pretty cool.
970880	971880	It's very pretty.
971880	975200	Yeah, it's actually very, very pretty.
975200	981840	But I do believe that you have to be over 18 to the page, so go see it, I'll be posting
981840	986640	the address into the chat room presently.
986640	987640	Very cool.
987640	988640	Alrighty.
988640	989640	Awesome.
989640	997000	Something else that's pretty awesome, fans of Geometry Wars will be quite happy, because
997000	1003640	with Project Gotham Racing 4, they'll be getting a brand new Geometry Wars game.
1003640	1010440	And no info, though, on, it's supposed to be not too different than Retro Evolved, but
1010440	1015400	it is going to be a little bit different, it's called Geometry War Waves.
1015400	1020160	No real details, though, on what exactly is different, but apparently not that much.
1020160	1024160	Well, I don't know what's going to change in the great amount of time it's going to
1024160	1028560	take for this game to come out, because Spore is apparently finished.
1028560	1033600	The game is not totally finished and ready to go, but apparently the game is complete.
1033600	1037800	This is coming from reports of people who have had a hands-on with Spore at Leipzig.
1037800	1042160	EA is simply going to be spending the next few months listening to feedback from players,
1042160	1047320	assuming the QA testers and beta testers, to tweak and polish Spore for its final release,
1047320	1050200	which is still set for next spring.
1050200	1053560	So certainly you can look around the internet on some different blogs there and find some
1053560	1058240	hands-on reports from Spore, which is definitely a game I am certainly looking forward to.
1058240	1061080	So GS68 in our chat room says, Spore forever?
1061080	1062080	I don't think so.
1062080	1064840	I don't think you can make those jokes anymore, because it does look like this game is actually
1064840	1065840	going to come out.
1065840	1066840	Hooray!
1066840	1067840	So, we'll see.
1067840	1068840	All right.
1068840	1073880	Anyway, it's time for an old favorite segment of ours here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1073880	1077160	It's a segment we like to call Listless.
1077160	1083960	All right.
1083960	1087240	The way Listless works is that we create a list here.
1087240	1091440	We're trying to define the definitive top three of a certain category, and tonight's
1091440	1097600	category is character we would most like to see in the upcoming track and field DS game.
1097600	1102280	Now, the character does not have to be a Konami character, but it helps.
1102280	1103280	Okay?
1103280	1104280	So, here's the deal.
1104280	1105280	Here's how it works.
1105280	1108800	We're going to go around, and myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and Miklotov will all give their
1108800	1109800	top three.
1109800	1112480	So that's going to leave us with a list of 12.
1112480	1118160	Then we will all go around the room and take one unworthy candidate off the list, leaving
1118160	1120120	a list of eight.
1120120	1123480	And we will post that list of eight to the chat room, and you'll vote for your number
1123480	1125480	one and your number two picks.
1125480	1129980	We'll tally them up, and the winning votes will be revealed a little later in the show.
1129980	1131560	That's how Listless works.
1131560	1133200	So who's going to start us off tonight?
1133200	1135200	Loki, you ready to go?
1135200	1136200	Sure.
1136200	1137200	All right.
1137200	1142120	What's your number three pick for character you would most like to see in track and field?
1142120	1147600	I guess it'd be a little weird, but I would like to see... Actually, this is kind of
1147600	1151040	a baby lawn from DDR 5th Mix.
1151040	1153280	Ah, baby lawn from DDR 5th Mix.
1153280	1154280	Why?
1154280	1155280	Just so you can run us a baby or what?
1155280	1156600	Because it's a baby running.
1156600	1157600	It's funny.
1157600	1159600	I don't know.
1159600	1161160	All right.
1161160	1162160	Baby lawn, says Loki.
1162160	1165600	Miklotov, do you have a number three pick?
1165600	1171760	I'll take Robbie the rabbit from Silent Hill, because what's cuter than a bunny with blood
1171760	1175200	on its mouth running around throwing stuff like javelins and things?
1175200	1177520	We're already picking just Konami.
1177520	1180320	Dude, you don't have to pick Konami.
1180320	1187400	I said it doesn't have to be Konami, but it helps, because the real game... Yeah, it
1187400	1188400	could be Nintendo, because it's DS51.
1188400	1190400	Let's leave it to Konami and Nintendo.
1190400	1191400	Oh, God.
1191400	1192400	I have to rethink my list.
1192400	1193400	All right.
1193400	1196160	I'll come up with some ideas.
1196160	1197480	Dark Soccer, your number three pick.
1197480	1201400	Aitsu or Koitsu from Parodius.
1201400	1203320	They're the little stickmen riding paper airplanes.
1203320	1205320	How the crap do you spell that?
1205320	1210440	A-I-T-S-U and then K-O-I-T-S-U.
1210440	1211440	From Parodius.
1211440	1212440	Yes.
1212440	1216400	All right.
1216400	1221840	My number three pick would also come from DDR, and that would be Alice, the little raving
1221840	1226160	character, because I think it would be funny for her to do a bunch of ecstasy and then
1226160	1229160	compete in Olympic events.
1229160	1231440	Her heart might explode right there on the track.
1231440	1235800	So I pick Alice, the raver girl from DDR Fifth Mix, plus a lot of the boys think Alice is
1235800	1238920	hot, so I'm sure you'll enjoy that, and some of the girls.
1238920	1240560	Loki, your number two pick.
1240560	1247400	This is also kind of tying in with Konami stuff, but I'm not sure what you would really
1247400	1248680	call it.
1248680	1255000	The dog from Silent Hill 2, from the dog ending, the Shiba Inu.
1255000	1256000	That's fantastic.
1256000	1257320	I love the dog.
1257320	1259920	So the dog from the dog ending of Silent Hill 2.
1259920	1260920	Good pick.
1260920	1263960	Mikol Tov, your number two pick.
1263960	1272960	I'm going to say Evil Rose, from Rumble Roses, because what little boy doesn't want to watch
1272960	1277800	the girls with the big breasts run around on the track, except for sane ones.
1277800	1278800	All right.
1278800	1282440	So one of the big titty girls from Rumble Roses will hopefully appear on track and field.
1282440	1283440	She can't run.
1283440	1284440	All right.
1284440	1285440	Dark Sakura, your number two pick.
1285440	1288560	My number two pick is going to be Pit.
1288560	1291200	Pit, from now a Nintendo character.
1291200	1292200	Okay, fair enough.
1292200	1294240	If he says we're Nintendo, I said Pit.
1294240	1295240	All right.
1295240	1296240	Pit from Kid Icarus.
1296240	1297240	Why not?
1297240	1298240	That would be fun.
1298240	1299240	Except he can fly.
1299240	1300240	Couldn't that be cheating?
1300240	1301240	So can Aizu and Koizu.
1301240	1302240	All right.
1302240	1303240	Moving on.
1303240	1305040	Number two pick for me.
1305040	1309720	My number two pick I would like to see in the game would be Dracula, from the Castlevania
1309720	1310720	games.
1310720	1311720	You know, why not?
1311720	1313760	And then somebody can come out and say...
1313760	1314760	Not by my hand.
1314760	1317800	I was once again given a gold medal.
1317800	1318800	Die, monster.
1318800	1319800	You don't belong in this world.
1319800	1321120	Except that was the other guy that said that.
1321120	1324000	But I still think it would be cool if Dracula was in the game.
1324000	1326280	So Dracula is my number two pick.
1326280	1328640	Number one pick, Sloki.
1328640	1330640	Oh, man.
1330640	1332960	Oh, let's see.
1332960	1338400	Number one pick, I will say, well, that doesn't really count because that's Hudson.
1338400	1343560	Well, no, that could work because Konami has license over Hudson games now, right?
1343560	1344560	Yeah.
1344560	1345560	You can do Hudson.
1345560	1350680	I don't know if this would be my number one pick, but Bomberman.
1350680	1357360	Okay, because maybe Bomberman could just leave bombs on the track, yes?
1357360	1358360	Sure.
1358360	1359360	That'll work.
1359360	1360360	Yeah, sure.
1360360	1361360	Right.
1361360	1362360	Whatever you say, Rob.
1362360	1363360	All right.
1363360	1365080	Miklotov, what would be your number one pick?
1365080	1372560	The left DDR arrow, because I think that would be pretty awesome.
1372560	1376560	So you just want to be the DDR arrow in the game.
1376560	1377560	Oops.
1377560	1379400	I totally didn't spell arrow right there.
1379400	1380400	Let's try that again.
1380400	1381400	There we go.
1381400	1382400	Much better.
1382400	1386560	So just the floating arrow would be a character with legs.
1386560	1389960	Maybe not with legs, but a sweatband.
1389960	1390960	You are weird.
1390960	1392000	All right.
1392000	1393320	Dark Sakura, your number one pick.
1393320	1395760	My number one pick is the mascot from Guitar Freak.
1395760	1398840	You need to lift the bag over his head.
1398840	1401840	I don't remember his name.
1401840	1404280	I just put Guitar Freak bag over head guy.
1404280	1405280	Okay.
1405280	1406280	Why is that?
1406280	1407280	What?
1407280	1408280	Oh, I had an excellent idea for one, but...
1408280	1409280	It's too late now.
1409280	1410280	Yeah, it's too late.
1410280	1411280	All right.
1411280	1412280	We'll see.
1412280	1413280	Okay.
1413280	1415020	My number one pick.
1415020	1419580	My number one pick did not get a lot of coverage in a lot of the various Konami games that
1419580	1421640	existed out there.
1421640	1429560	In fact, my number one pick was really obscure, because he was only in one game that Konami
1429560	1432120	ever put out, and it was on the PC.
1432120	1433120	But I'll tell you what.
1433120	1436680	If you've been listening to this show for some amount of time, then you know the love
1436680	1441440	that the people of this program have for Mr. Spanky from DDR PC.
1441440	1446900	And that is my number one pick, would be Mr. Spanky, the guy that's dressed up like a dominatrix
1446900	1449040	character from DDR PC.
1449040	1451360	Because then the game would be rated M, and no one would get to play it.
1451360	1454160	So that actually doesn't turn out to be such a good idea.
1454160	1457120	But hey, this is supposed to be a fantasy.
1457120	1460160	My runner up would be the Konami code.
1460160	1461160	Just have the...
1461160	1463760	Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
1463760	1465000	Have the Konami code in it.
1465000	1466000	No, no, no.
1466000	1469360	Oh, I should have said the little ship from Parodius, because then you can have the sound
1469360	1471000	blaster, or Twinbee.
1471000	1472720	You know what also amazes me about this list?
1472720	1475440	Is that not a single damn Metal Gear character on the whole list.
1475440	1477540	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
1477540	1478540	That about Tastra.
1478540	1482360	Change Baghead Guy to Twinbee.
1482360	1483360	Twinbee?
1483360	1484360	Twinbee.
1484360	1485360	All right.
1485360	1487360	I'm going to try it better.
1487360	1488360	All right.
1488360	1489360	All right.
1489360	1490360	Well, she changed it then.
1490360	1491360	Twinbee.
1491360	1492360	Let's see.
1492360	1494280	SSJ100 Matt voted for the goalie from Blade of Steel.
1494280	1495280	That's pretty awesome.
1495280	1496280	All right.
1496280	1497280	Here's the list of stands right now.
1497280	1499440	But remember, we're going around and eliminating off the list here.
1499440	1505700	Baby Lawn, Robby the Rabbit, Aitsu Koitsu, Alice, the dog from the dog inning of Silent
1505700	1514800	Hill 2, Evil Rose, Pit, Dracula, Bomberman, the left DDR arrow, Twinbee, and Mr. Spanky.
1514800	1515800	Why left and not right?
1515800	1516800	Just out of curiosity.
1516800	1520400	Because it's just the first one I thought of.
1520400	1521400	All right.
1521400	1523860	Loki, one of these is not worthy of being on the list.
1523860	1529360	What is not worthy of being on the list?
1529360	1534800	I'm just going to say Aitsu Koitsu because I have no idea what the hell that is.
1534800	1535800	Very obscure.
1535800	1537200	Yeah, that was a little too obscure for my taste.
1537200	1538200	They're awesome.
1538200	1539200	All right.
1539200	1541880	Miklotov, one of these is not worthy of being on the list.
1541880	1545720	What is not worthy of being on the list?
1545720	1550000	Just because it really looks out of place on that list, I'm going to throw out Pit even
1550000	1555240	though I love Kid Icarus a whole lot and yeah, I'm sorry.
1555240	1556240	All right.
1556240	1562020	Dark Sakura, what is not worthy of the list?
1562020	1569200	I'm going to vote for Alice.
1569200	1574200	Alice is not worthy of being on the list and raver kids everywhere are crying.
1574200	1575200	What does that mean, Miklotov?
1575200	1577200	Have you seen Alice from Supernova 2 yet?
1577200	1581200	She's all dressed up like an idiot and weirdo.
1581200	1582200	All right.
1582200	1583200	Well, whatever.
1583200	1584200	Let's see.
1584200	1588600	The one I deem worthy of not being on the list is... Oh, this is hard.
1588600	1592520	I'm also going to take out a DDR character and say Baby Lawn is not worthy of being on
1592520	1593520	the list.
1593520	1594980	So there you go.
1594980	1597800	That leaves our list as... There's a little nudity in that card.
1597800	1601760	All right, that leaves our list as Robbie the Rabbit, the dog from the dog-ending of
1601760	1610080	Silent Hill 2, Evil Rose, Dracula, Bomberman, the left DDR arrow, Twinbee, and Mr. Spanky.
1610080	1611080	All right.
1611080	1614080	So I'm going to post that there in the chat room and if you would, send a private message
1614080	1618000	to Rob Roberts, not Sky tonight because I don't have my normal name.
1618000	1622280	Send a private message with your number one and number two pick.
1622280	1624920	It is important what you designate as one and two.
1624920	1628800	If you do not designate, I will assume your first pick is your number one.
1628800	1632600	So there you have it.
1632600	1634920	Did you find anything else that you thought should have been on the list, Loki, because
1634920	1637400	I saw you searching Wikipedia frantically?
1637400	1642080	I was trying to think whatever... I don't remember what the boss was called in Contra,
1642080	1643080	like the giant heart.
1643080	1646000	I was thinking the giant alien head thing would have been pretty awesome.
1646000	1649640	What about the vomiting baby turtle thing or whatever that was from like...
1649640	1656040	Aw, we should have more time to prepare, a vomiting baby turtle would have been awesome.
1656040	1660720	An unsold copy of, what was it, Bomberman Act Zero.
1660720	1665280	I was actually thinking, because you know, I was thinking really obscure.
1665280	1670440	You know, if we were going Sega, I'd totally say the Oppa Oppa.
1670440	1671440	But we didn't go Sega.
1671440	1672440	No, we didn't.
1672440	1673440	We sure didn't.
1673440	1674440	Because the Oppa Oppa would kill everybody.
1674440	1675440	Right.
1675440	1676480	Because the Oppa Oppa's awesome.
1676480	1680240	We will announce the winners a wee bit later, but for now we've got to get back into some
1680240	1685800	news and then the Skype line, your calls at Orange Lounge Radio username on Skype or our
1685800	1688480	800 number 1877 game OLR.
1688480	1691200	We'll get to those very shortly, but first a little more news.
1691200	1692200	Loki.
1692200	1699360	Yes, and apparently people were not too happy with BioShock's way they've handled widescreen,
1699360	1704260	and apparently there are some fixes though if you want to correct that.
1704260	1711960	There is a hack that you can download for the PC version and it will allow you to, not
1711960	1716720	necessarily resize your screen, but resize the view on there.
1716720	1723080	And you can do all sorts of fun things, including different resolution sizes like 16.9, true
1723080	1724080	16.9.
1724080	1728240	Because apparently the way this game worked before is they would just kind of do like
1728240	1730480	a reverse pan and scan on it.
1730480	1734160	They would cut the top and bottom off on the widescreen.
1734160	1741200	But apparently there's also, I guess there's going to be a fix coming for Xbox 360 over
1741200	1744640	live at some point as well, at least that's a rumor.
1744640	1751720	So if that's really bothering you, you can go ahead and download the patch, which is
1751720	1763360	available it looks like on dl.tocaedit.com slash BioShockDFOV.zip.
1763360	1767000	Loki out of curiosity, what do you think about that whole fallout about how people were really
1767000	1772960	pissed about all the issues the PC was having, not just the widescreen stuff, but the fact
1772960	1776520	that you could only install so many copies on one machine and kind of like how quick
1776520	1779360	they've been to respond to that.
1779360	1783780	The whole widescreen thing was stupid, I think, because I mean personally I don't think anyone
1783780	1788440	noticed it during the demo until someone mentioned, oh hey, by the way, this is like that.
1788440	1790720	They're all, oh my God, that's horrible.
1790720	1795480	I mean it doesn't just detract anything from the game, so big deal.
1795480	1799360	I mean you can fix it on the PC now, so I don't know, it's not a big deal.
1799360	1801360	The cop protection thing kind of sucks.
1801360	1806120	I know a lot of people are like installing on multiple computers, which I guess technically
1806120	1811480	violates some sort of rights or something, I don't know, but there's a fix coming for
1811480	1818160	that as well, so I don't think that's a big worry, but yeah, little bitty things.
1818160	1823200	All right, SSJ100Matt says, though Pan and Scan ruins movies.
1823200	1824200	It does.
1824200	1825880	It absolutely does.
1825880	1826880	I agree, actually.
1826880	1830760	All right, let's open up our Skype line and hear from you guys.
1830760	1833360	If you want to give us a call, the Skype line is now open.
1833360	1839640	Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, or you can always give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR
1839640	1843960	is the number to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
1843960	1848120	And while we're waiting for those to come in, I'll just say that this is your last chance
1848120	1850600	to submit your votes for listless.
1850600	1855040	I think most people in our chat room already voted, but just in case, there's a couple
1855040	1857960	stragglers, we'll take those.
1857960	1860000	Let's go to the phones.
1860000	1863000	Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
1863000	1864000	This is Ravenstaufen.
1864000	1865000	Well, hello.
1865000	1866000	The guy, that guy.
1866000	1867780	Damn, you get through first every time.
1867780	1868780	How is that?
1868780	1869780	All right, well, what's on your mind, Ravenstaufen?
1869780	1872400	I have a fast finger and a new keyboard.
1872400	1874520	I'll leave the fast finger comment as is.
1874520	1875520	Well, what's on your mind?
1875520	1878720	Lame mean finger.
1878720	1884260	My comment tonight is you mentioned that Nintendo surpassed the 360?
1884260	1887400	In terms of worldwide sales, yes.
1887400	1893080	Well, you know, I know this is going to turn into a flame world real fast and real quick,
1893080	1895520	so I'll try to keep the flames to a minimum.
1895520	1899960	But you know, I believe that people that buy in the Wii is not us hardcore gamers.
1899960	1903640	Like we bought it, I bought it, you bought it, Loki bought it, Dark Soccer bought it,
1903640	1905760	but those soccer moms of the world.
1905760	1910200	No, I totally agree with you, but the sale is a sale, right?
1910200	1911200	Sales is a sale.
1911200	1912200	Money is money, right?
1912200	1913800	The bottom line is a dollar.
1913800	1919480	However, I will say this, what I would be curious to see is how many games per system
1919480	1920480	is out there.
1920480	1921480	You know what I mean?
1921480	1924880	Like a 360 owner probably has a lot of games at this point, whereas a Wii owner maybe doesn't
1924880	1926000	have so many games.
1926000	1929320	But I don't know, that may not be true because then again, you look at the games that are
1929320	1931720	out on the Wii, there's not a lot for hardcore gamers.
1931720	1932720	I mean, there's some.
1932720	1936580	You know, you're Super Paper Mario, you're Metroid, but there is a lot of crap out there
1936580	1937580	on the Wii.
1937580	1938580	Like Boogie?
1938580	1941800	Your Happy Feets, well, I haven't played Boogie, but I don't know.
1941800	1945820	But that commercial really wants me, I'm memorized about that commercial of Boogie.
1945820	1950440	It almost wants me to buy it, but my mind goes like, don't buy it, it's junk.
1950440	1952560	Don't buy it, don't fall for it.
1952560	1955040	I've never seen the commercial, but I don't watch TV.
1955040	1957480	What's it like?
1957480	1960120	It's they're doing a disco one, and they're like doing the Wii mode.
1960120	1964080	It has nothing to do with the game, no gameplay footage whatsoever.
1964080	1966120	But the commercials, I think it was great.
1966120	1970240	You know, I'm like, wow, that looks like fun, and then I smack myself going like, shit,
1970240	1971500	it's not fun.
1971500	1975360	But they do show you how to actually play the game in the commercial, because they do
1975360	1980000	have the Wii mode and the nunchuck moving back and forth, and what I assume is how you're
1980000	1982120	supposed to play that piece of crap game.
1982120	1986720	And then I smack myself, and then I set free.
1986720	1988520	Yeah, renting might be a thing to do.
1988520	1993960	Ross Steel UT says, problem is that most people are just buying it as a Wii sports machine,
1993960	1995760	and will never buy anything for it.
1995760	1998280	Well, what about Wii Play, though, because Wii Play's been selling a lot.
1998280	2001040	And how come the PlayStation 2's still selling?
2001040	2003000	Gold Banjo, I think same reason, actually.
2003000	2005600	Gold Banjo says, my little sister sings along during that commercial.
2005600	2009320	I think the PlayStation 2 continues to sell, because they're A, cheap, and B, there's a
2009320	2011400	shitload of games for it.
2011400	2014160	I mean, just massive and massive amounts of games for it.
2014160	2015160	So.
2015160	2016160	All right.
2016160	2017160	One more thing.
2017160	2019520	Of course, one more thing, sir.
2019520	2023560	You know, the new release of Bioshock came out, and I was just wondering, do you think
2023560	2027600	this game's going to be buried like Dead Rising when it came out in the first?
2027600	2032000	Dead Rising's one of those games that everyone loved, played, you know, Loki loved it, I
2032000	2033000	loved it.
2033000	2037120	Is Bioshock going to fall under that, like, we love it, and we leave it for, like, another
2037120	2038120	game?
2038120	2041640	I'm going to take a very controversial stance here, and I'm going to say yes.
2041640	2046320	It will fall off the radar because of lack of multiplayer, because I think people are
2046320	2051920	going to go, like, just kill through the game in the single player mode, and then, you know,
2051920	2055840	while there will be a few that will replay it, and the faithful that will show it to
2055840	2059920	their friends and replay it, I think when Halo 3 comes out, a lot of people are going
2059920	2063560	to go over there, and Halo 3 is going to have the lasting multiplayer.
2063560	2067520	So I, you know, and I realized, you know, I could be wrong, but I think the lack of
2067520	2071520	multiplayer, also very similar to Dead Rising, I think the lack of multiplayer is really
2071520	2072600	going to hurt the game.
2072600	2079640	But at the same time, I think Bioshock will trump Halo 3 on some end-of-year best lists.
2079640	2083200	So I think you may see a small resurgence come the end of the year during award times.
2083200	2088000	Yeah, I'm just saying that because, you know, this game has, you know, everyone loved it.
2088000	2091000	You know, it's like, you know, what's that game I'm trying to think of?
2091000	2092000	Floss Planet.
2092000	2095080	You know, everyone played it at, like, for two weeks, and then the next game came out
2095080	2099000	with Graw, and then everyone went, oh, what's this, and then dropped it like a lead balloon.
2099000	2101760	Well, that's a lot of the Xbox Live Arcade releases, too.
2101760	2106680	I mean, how many people on your friends list do you see playing Street Fighter II anymore?
2106680	2109520	How many people are still playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night?
2109520	2110520	Doom.
2110520	2111520	Doom.
2111520	2113960	My hand is raised because we were playing it recently.
2113960	2116600	Well, okay, so one person on the entire internet is playing it.
2116600	2117600	No, I'm just kidding.
2117600	2119800	I'm not a supporting person on the internet.
2119800	2123080	But if I look at my friends list, I do not see people playing a lot of the old arcade
2123080	2128160	releases except for a few big, big biggies, like Geometry Wars.
2128160	2131280	Pac-Man Championship Edition still comes up.
2131280	2133480	So a couple of those.
2133480	2134480	That is it.
2134480	2135480	Thank you for taking my call.
2135480	2136480	You're welcome.
2136480	2137480	One more comment here really quickly.
2137480	2141400	DJ Kibbles and Bits in chat says, the thing is, a lot of people stopped playing Dead Rising
2141400	2143240	because of that damn save system.
2143240	2146960	Yeah, that was definitely one of my, why I stopped playing.
2146960	2151200	After a while, it just got too annoying to keep replaying it over and over again.
2151200	2153360	Yeah, they screwed up that save system.
2153360	2156640	You had to go pee or take a poop or sleep.
2156640	2159080	That was dumb.
2159080	2162960	Rasteel UT says lots of people play games and don't go on live.
2162960	2166360	That's true, but I'm using the rationalization that you have to go on live to get the game
2166360	2172200	in the first place, unless it was on that arcade unplugged disc, but I truly think that's
2172200	2173440	in the minority.
2173440	2174440	One more comment.
2174440	2175440	Yes.
2175440	2177320	You would think that a mall that's so big would have more bathrooms.
2177320	2178320	No.
2178320	2179320	All right.
2179320	2181920	Ravenstaufen, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, buddy, okay?
2181920	2182920	You too, bye.
2182920	2183920	All right.
2183920	2192520	Again, if you want to give us a call, our number 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on
2192520	2198240	Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and there's lots of calls coming in, but unfortunately Skype
2198240	2202080	is only allowing me to take one call at a time.
2202080	2207040	Oh my gosh, this is a mess.
2207040	2213280	All right, I'm going to have to... Hold on guys, we're going to change the options here
2213280	2217720	in Skype so that only fricking one call can come through at a time.
2217720	2218720	This is annoying.
2218720	2222680	Loki, do you have any last minute stories while I change this real quick here?
2222680	2223680	Yes I do.
2223680	2224680	Thank you.
2224680	2225680	Give us one real quick.
2225680	2231260	Okay, real quick, there's some interesting things coming out about the brand new Brain
2231260	2235400	Age 2 DS, the one that, you know, red and black, whatever.
2235400	2240760	Apparently the LCD screen's a little bit dimmer than the normal DS Lite.
2240760	2245800	Uh oh, that sucks for people that bought it.
2245800	2248240	Let's see, enter interesting things.
2248240	2256600	There was a PSP petition for Resident Evil coming onto the PSP, it got the attention
2256600	2266400	of Capcom, who says if you get over 10,000 signatures that will draw significant attention,
2266400	2273120	and now they're up to 17,000 signatures, so maybe we'll see a PSP version of Resident
2273120	2274120	Evil.
2274120	2277400	Hold on, I fixed Skype, so save the rest for a little later, all righty?
2277400	2278400	Okay.
2278400	2279400	Can you do that?
2279400	2280400	All right.
2280400	2281400	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2281400	2282400	Who's this?
2282400	2283400	GS68.
2283400	2285400	What's on your mind, GS68?
2285400	2292880	Well, I noticed that all of the games on the Virtual Console are, well, console games.
2292880	2298840	I haven't heard anything about Game Boy games being on the Virtual Console or Game Boy Color
2298840	2299840	games.
2299840	2301640	That's an interesting thought.
2301640	2304960	We don't hear, I mean we always hear about all these systems coming to the Virtual Console
2304960	2310840	and now we even talk about CDs, but yet we never have the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance
2310840	2313400	even or Game Boy Color ever talked about.
2313400	2314400	Why is that, you guys?
2314400	2317200	Do you think there's a reason why Nintendo doesn't put these games out on Wii Virtual
2317200	2319560	Console?
2319560	2323680	Because you really don't need to play a black and white version of Mario Brothers.
2323680	2324680	On the big screen TV?
2324680	2326320	Yeah, it just wouldn't look good.
2326320	2331720	I would actually like to see them port crappy Metroid 2 from Game Boy onto the Virtual Console
2331720	2335800	because that game was a pain to play on the original Game Boy.
2335800	2338760	I think actually playing it on TV would make it a worthwhile experience.
2338760	2343840	Or how about they do a Metroid All-Stars where they just redesign the game and upgrade the
2343840	2344840	graphics?
2344840	2345840	Yeah, that would be good too.
2345840	2349240	Oh, and Kid Icarus on Game Boy, even though I'm not sure if it's a good game at all, but
2349240	2350600	I would still like to play that too.
2350600	2355080	There's a lot of games back then that I missed out on because I was too little and now I
2355080	2362640	want to play them, but they're impossible to find unless I emulate them.
2362640	2365200	GS68, what are your thoughts on that?
2365200	2371760	Well, I don't really know a lot of good Game Boy games.
2371760	2375960	Like there are the games that I grew up with and that's about it.
2375960	2378120	Holy crap, I can hear myself.
2378120	2379560	What got you thinking about this?
2379560	2383300	I don't know, just randomly I guess.
2383300	2384400	That's all good.
2384400	2388600	You know what would actually be really cool though would be, even though the DS doesn't
2388600	2393200	play the old Game Boy games, it would be kind of cool if there was that functionality between
2393200	2397440	the DS and the Wii a little later on, which we all know there is some functionality there,
2397440	2400720	where maybe you could download a virtual console game from the Game Boy and play it on your
2400720	2401720	DS.
2401720	2403280	Wouldn't that be kind of neat?
2403280	2407680	But I haven't heard any news about the DS Wii connectivity yet.
2407680	2411560	The only thing I've really heard is Pokemon Battle Revolution, which isn't a whole lot.
2411560	2412560	Oh yeah.
2412560	2413560	That's really it.
2413560	2415280	Well, GSXC, that was a good thought.
2415280	2417200	Anything else you want to comment on tonight?
2417200	2421960	If Mr. Spanky wins the list list, I'll make videos of myself killing patients in trauma
2421960	2422960	center.
2422960	2427200	Alright, so if Mr. Spanky wins list list, you're going to kill patients in trauma centers
2427200	2428200	and put it on the YouTubes.
2428200	2431400	Well, we're going to find out very soon what won.
2431400	2436480	Just out of curiosity, can you describe your hatred of Mr. Spanky to the listeners who
2436480	2438480	may not be familiar with the character?
2438480	2449480	Well, I heard him on, well, I heard his voice on many episodes ago, and, well, I didn't
2449480	2450480	really like it.
2450480	2453520	I'm sorry to hear that, although you know that wasn't the official voice, right?
2453520	2456840	That was just some idiot pretending, right?
2456840	2457840	Yeah.
2457840	2461480	I am noticing there is no article on Mr. Spanky on Wikipedia.
2461480	2465360	I was hoping for some pictures or something, like an article I could refer people to, but
2465360	2466360	there's nothing.
2466360	2467480	Did you spell it with an E?
2467480	2468640	I did it both ways.
2468640	2472080	I did it once with an E and once with no E. How about, yeah, DDR PC?
2472080	2475080	DDR PC, let me see.
2475080	2478400	No, there's no DDR PC article either.
2478400	2482760	There's just a Dance Dance Revolution main article.
2482760	2485440	How is there no Mr. Spanky article on Wikipedia?
2485440	2487160	He's an important part of the culture.
2487160	2489560	Well, he's a DDR character.
2489560	2492600	You don't really deserve to know about Wikipedia articles.
2492600	2493600	I don't get it.
2493600	2494600	Alright.
2494600	2495600	I'm sick of looking.
2495600	2496600	Wait, no I'm not.
2496600	2500400	Yeah, there's no article for the Windows PC version of Dance Dance Revolution.
2500400	2501400	Sadness.
2501400	2502400	Alright.
2502400	2504200	Anyway, I'm done.
2504200	2506040	Anything else you want to share with us, GS68?
2506040	2507840	No, I'm good.
2507840	2510040	Alright, well have a good one GS68.
2510040	2511040	We'll talk to you next time.
2511040	2513040	Thanks, you too.
2513040	2514440	Bye-bye.
2514440	2520320	I'm hoping one of our Wikipedia faithful will somehow create that Mr. Spanky article.
2520320	2521880	That would be all kinds of awesome.
2521880	2522880	Let's go to another call.
2522880	2523880	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2523880	2524880	Who's this?
2524880	2525880	Hey, guys.
2525880	2526880	Hello, Insanist.
2526880	2528520	Hello, Insanist.
2528520	2530800	What is on your mind?
2530800	2535040	I don't know if you guys know, but that Penny Arcade Expo thing went on, and if you can
2535040	2538640	tell, I have absolutely no voice from being at it all weekend.
2538640	2539760	Oh, wow.
2539760	2541920	I think Penny Arcade Expo should happen more often.
2541920	2543240	It kills your voice.
2543240	2545320	Yeah, fuck you too, buddy.
2545320	2546320	Alright.
2546320	2551160	Well, I wanted to go to Penny Arcade Expo really, really badly, but here's the hilarious
2551160	2552160	part.
2552160	2556880	The largest showing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show anywhere in the world was also this weekend
2556880	2560520	in Reno where they have like 4,000 people come out and see the movie, so I wanted to
2560520	2561520	go to that.
2561520	2563160	Penny Arcade Expo was also this weekend.
2563160	2565920	I wanted to go to that, but guess what trumped both of those things?
2565920	2569960	One of my best friends from college got married over the weekend, so I went to the wedding
2569960	2570960	on Saturday.
2570960	2572360	So congratulations, Amanda and Tom.
2572360	2575560	Wave, wave, wave hug, although I know they don't listen to this program, but they got
2575560	2577600	married, so I had to go.
2577600	2579400	Well, how was Penny Arcade Expo?
2579400	2580400	So you were there.
2580400	2581760	You were our man on the street.
2581760	2583480	What's going on?
2583480	2590080	Well, what was really disappointing was Sony really didn't bring much to the show.
2590080	2593600	In fact, it was something outside of Sony's booth that was for the Playstation 3, which
2593600	2597480	I gave the unofficial OLR seal of approval.
2597480	2599680	This game called Eye of Judgment.
2599680	2602320	It's a collectible card game that works with the PS3.
2602320	2603320	Wait a minute.
2603320	2606640	You gave the OLR award to the Eye of Judgment?
2606640	2607640	Yes.
2607640	2609040	Fired!
2609040	2610040	Have you played it?
2610040	2611040	No, I haven't.
2611040	2613800	I saw the tech demo and I was like, why?
2613800	2617000	We did kind of see it at E3, so I'm curious.
2617000	2619200	So you're being completely serious.
2619200	2620200	This game is awesome.
2620200	2624360	Okay, I won't give it the OLR, I'll give it the STFU, I'll leave that for you guys.
2624360	2626360	No, no, that's fine, but I'm just curious.
2626360	2627360	You're absolutely serious.
2627360	2629000	This game rocked.
2629000	2630120	I thoroughly enjoyed it.
2630120	2635880	I'm a huge CCG fan, and I've been, obviously, I'm a huge video games fan, and this was a
2635880	2638360	very good combination of the two.
2638360	2642520	It felt more interactive to me than just putting a piece of cardboard on the table.
2642520	2646720	I could actually see what was going on, and I thought the technology was good and it was
2646720	2652120	something different, which I'm always welcome to seeing.
2652120	2656120	The graphics were great, there weren't any glitches with reading the cards.
2656120	2660640	I had no problem with it, and really, Sony didn't bring much else to the table.
2660640	2661920	Oh, so I get it.
2661920	2666520	So you're giving the award to Eye of Judgment by default, because there were no other games
2666520	2667520	there.
2667520	2668920	There was nothing new from Sony there.
2668920	2669920	I see.
2669920	2670920	It was bad.
2670920	2674200	But was Eye of Judgment the best thing you saw on any system?
2674200	2676200	No.
2676200	2682560	I'll be getting to that, but my Wii award goes to Metroid Prime 3.
2682560	2686360	This game's amazing, and you need to all pick it up next week.
2686360	2687360	Why?
2687360	2691080	One, it has the best Wii remote controls I've ever seen.
2691080	2695640	The looking is fantastic, the shooting is fantastic, the motion controls are very intuitive
2695640	2697420	and a lot of fun.
2697420	2701920	But I didn't like Prime 1 and 2, well, I take that back, I kind of like Prime 2, the multiplayer
2701920	2706340	mode, but I found first person Metroid so hard to play, am I going to suddenly get over
2706340	2707440	it with number 3?
2707440	2708840	Will it bring me back?
2708840	2710260	I think I will.
2710260	2713800	The motion controls really make you feel like a part of the game, and some of the boss battles
2713800	2714800	are amazing.
2714800	2719000	I got to demo the Ridley boss battle.
2719000	2723600	I'm not going to spoil too much, but it was one of the coolest boss battles I've ever
2723600	2724600	fought.
2724600	2725600	Ever.
2725600	2727600	Did you get a rise out of it?
2727600	2728600	Yes, yes I did.
2728600	2729600	I knocked down there.
2729600	2732000	Did it make you feel excited in a special place?
2732000	2733000	Sometimes.
2733000	2736680	Did you have to go back to your hotel room and take care of some business after playing
2736680	2737680	the demo?
2737680	2740940	No, because I had to go run tournaments, unfortunately.
2740940	2741940	I see.
2741940	2745380	Alright, so how about your Xbox 360 award?
2745380	2747000	And overall award.
2747000	2748000	Rock Band.
2748000	2749200	No question.
2749200	2754160	This game is amazing, and yes, I know everybody in the chat room is like, hey, I played this
2754160	2757100	before, it's Guitar Freak Stromania.
2757100	2761360	And you're right, it is Guitar Freak Stromania and Karaoke Revolution, but it's with songs
2761360	2765500	that the mainstream people are going to know, and that's going to sell a lot of copies and
2765500	2768000	make harmonics a lot of money.
2768000	2774640	The interface is great, the controllers are great, the guitars for guitar, excuse me,
2774640	2777600	Rock Band feel like real guitars.
2777600	2783960	The fret buttons are colored on the top of the controller, rather, on the buttons themselves.
2783960	2786240	But it's the same layout as guitar here.
2786240	2789960	Here's my question for you, do you think if Rock Band does well, there'll be a pop band
2789960	2790960	that comes out?
2790960	2795680	Because, you know, I like shitty music, and there's just not a lot, I mean, Rock Band
2795680	2799160	actually has a lot of good music in it, but I like shitty music, so is there any hope
2799160	2801720	for me and my love of pop music?
2801720	2805320	If you would have brought me that question, I would have asked the harmonics guys.
2805320	2806640	Damn you.
2806640	2811180	But with them releasing Guitar Hero 80s, anything can happen.
2811180	2815040	So actually, I honestly wouldn't rule that out if, I mean, a lot of the songs in Guitar
2815040	2822200	Hero 80s weren't that great, but I think Pop Band could very well be a viable idea.
2822200	2826720	Going to comments from the chat room here, Zaku says, excuse me sir, but harmonics fucked
2826720	2828940	up the drums, nuff said.
2828940	2830600	Have you used them?
2830600	2833280	Oh wait, you can't respond in time.
2833280	2837000	No you didn't, they're great, they're very responsive.
2837000	2842960	My only beef is the Xbox button is in the way of the rightmost two drums, and that got
2842960	2844880	annoying a couple of times.
2844880	2848080	Tiger Claw says, Rob, don't give them any ideas, next thing you know there will be a
2848080	2850640	game called Boy Band.
2850640	2853520	Miklotov got all excited over there.
2853520	2855400	I think that's called Sing Star actually.
2855400	2859080	Yeah, it is probably called Sing Star, that would be so much fun.
2859080	2862040	You're not getting Rock Band, we all know you're going to get the High School Musical
2862040	2865080	Sing It game, so just buzz off.
2865080	2870720	I can't officially name this as a winner, but the finals for the Omega-Thon, if anybody's
2870720	2876240	not familiar with that, it packs picks a bunch of people who are pre-registered and plays
2876240	2877400	them at a bunch of video games.
2877400	2883880	It went from Jenga from the beginning to Halo 3 as the final.
2883880	2888680	They showed two new maps called, one was called Narrows, which is a hallway with vehicles
2888680	2891040	and it was a hell of a lot of fun.
2891040	2896400	The other one was called Guardian, which looked very base-like and showed off jump pads and
2896400	2898800	elevators and was really cool.
2898800	2904540	Some new weapons, a flame thrower will be in the game, fire grenades will be in the
2904540	2909500	game, a Spartan laser will be in the game, and this item called the Gravity Hammer, which
2909500	2911480	is the sword on steroids.
2911480	2914120	Huh, wow.
2914120	2915120	How did Halo 3 look?
2915120	2918920	Because a lot of people complained the beta didn't look that much better, it looked really
2918920	2919920	good.
2919920	2920920	Did it?
2920920	2922720	It looked really good.
2922720	2925840	What I was most impressed with is the heads-up display.
2925840	2929720	It got a big overhaul from Halo 2.
2929720	2935480	The shield meter is directly top-center on the screen, so you'll be seeing it at all
2935480	2937840	times.
2937840	2943160	They have your weapons and ammo in the upper right corner and it has icons and the button
2943160	2946200	instead of saying, press this button to pick up this now.
2946200	2952400	They streamlined it a lot and I really, really think this will get rid of the disappointment
2952400	2955040	that, at least in my opinion, was Halo 2.
2955040	2957280	Let's see, Gold Banjo says, yay fire.
2957280	2961000	GS68 though asks, any word on the man cannon?
2961000	2968720	I did not see a man cannon, but there is a plasma cannon that you could, it was mounted
2968720	2971920	but you could yank it out and run after people with it, which is pretty cool.
2971920	2972920	All right.
2972920	2975560	Well, anything else you want to share from Penny Arcade Expo since you were lucky enough
2975560	2976560	to go?
2976560	2977560	Two things.
2977560	2984920	One, the fragdoll stole a flowchart about boobs that I made and two, Wil Wheaton kicked
2984920	2986720	my ass at Guitar Hero.
2986720	2989040	You poor thing.
2989040	2990040	That was pretty cool.
2990040	2991040	He's a good sport about it.
2991040	2992040	Wow.
2992040	2993200	But that's about it.
2993200	2994640	Penny Arcade Expo is great.
2994640	2995880	I wish you guys were there.
2995880	2998480	Wait, how the hell did you end up playing Guitar Hero with Wil Wheaton?
2998480	2999480	Was it just by chance?
2999480	3002760	Well, Matt and he entered the tournament and beforehand he was in there warming up and
3002760	3005720	asked if I could get a game with him because I'm probably not going to get a chance to
3005720	3006720	play and he's like, sure.
3006720	3010600	And we played a Let's Talk More Rock Expert and he kicked my ass.
3010600	3011600	Wow.
3011600	3012600	Huh.
3012600	3013600	Something else.
3013600	3014600	All right.
3014600	3018600	Well, Insanus, thank you so much for the call and a real quick plug for your show if you'd
3018600	3019600	like.
3019600	3025600	STFU every Thursday at seven followed by the Insanus hour if I'm up to it whenever STFU
3025600	3026600	is over.
3026600	3027600	All right.
3027600	3030960	Good to see that there is some weekday programming still happening on the station on Thursdays
3030960	3035680	and occasionally on Tuesdays, not so much on Wednesdays.
3035680	3039680	And if I have any spare swag left over, I will either be giving it to you guys or away
3039680	3040680	to listeners.
3040680	3041680	Hoorah.
3041680	3042680	More on that on Thursday.
3042680	3043680	All right.
3043680	3047320	Well, I was just going to say, speaking of Tuesday, I will be live this week.
3047320	3048320	Hooray.
3048320	3049320	Yay.
3049320	3050320	I have something to do on Tuesday.
3050320	3052320	But I won't be here on next Sunday.
3052320	3055620	But I will not be here on Wednesday because I'm in LA for four days.
3055620	3058840	I won't be here next Sunday because of something very special.
3058840	3059840	And that would be-
3059840	3062520	I have one more request because you haven't done it tomorrow.
3062520	3064920	Well, let Jamie finish your thought and then you can have your turn.
3064920	3065920	Yes, Jamie.
3065920	3066920	Okay.
3066920	3067920	It's the weekend of my second wedding anniversary.
3067920	3068920	Well, congratulations.
3068920	3069920	Yay, Jamie.
3069920	3075440	So I will be making Dan buy me expensive food on Saturday and he's taking me to Weird Al
3075440	3076440	on Sunday.
3076440	3077440	All right.
3077440	3081160	It should be an interesting show Sunday because Labor Day weekend and everything.
3081160	3082160	So we'll see.
3082160	3083160	We'll still be tracking you.
3083160	3085160	I'll be here if we do a drunk show.
3085160	3086160	Hmm.
3086160	3087160	Hmm.
3087160	3091160	Maybe, you know, I don't have any plans for Monday.
3091160	3092160	Hmm.
3092160	3093160	The plot thickens.
3093160	3094160	All right, DMN.
3094160	3096440	What was your one more thought?
3096440	3098320	You haven't hung up on me in a while.
3098320	3099320	You're right.
3099320	3100320	So I should do that now.
3100320	3101320	All right.
3101320	3107240	If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3107240	3109320	We'll take one more call.
3109320	3110320	Yeah.
3110320	3112320	DMN goes by Insanus now.
3112320	3113320	I don't know why.
3113320	3114400	Why did Prince change his name?
3114400	3115400	He just did.
3115400	3118680	No, he did because his name was copyrighted by the label he was on before.
3118680	3120800	Do you always have to know everything?
3120800	3121800	Yes.
3121800	3128760	To DMN slash Insanus slash whatever your name's going to be tomorrow, if you don't sign on
3128760	3132160	to WoW, I'm going to get somebody to kick you out of the guild because you're being
3132160	3133760	too inactive.
3133760	3134760	And I don't like that.
3134760	3135760	Thank you.
3135760	3136760	All right.
3136760	3139220	Well, I'd like to go to another call now.
3139220	3143160	You can use your WoW guild chat some other time, Miklotov, okay?
3143160	3146400	Wait, you can't kick him from the guild because you don't have WoW.
3146400	3148280	You had to cancel WoW.
3148280	3149280	All right.
3149280	3150280	We got to go back to the phones.
3150280	3151280	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
3151280	3152280	Who's this?
3152280	3153280	Hey, it's AZHP.
3153280	3154280	Hello, AZHP.
3154280	3158080	Sorry to make you listen to our bickering.
3158080	3163000	As SSJ100Matt says in the chat, oh no, guild drama.
3163000	3167600	Although I should say, if you want to join the OL Army Guild, which is actually called
3167600	3173080	Order of Valtiel, it's on the Ravencrest server horde side, and it's fun, lots of fun.
3173080	3175520	I don't know why you say it's an OrangeLounge Guild.
3175520	3176880	It's my guild.
3176880	3178520	It's more Silent Hill than anything.
3178520	3182520	Because it's the one I play on, and you play on it, and some of the other people that have
3182520	3184320	been on the show in the past play on it.
3184320	3188520	Plus, if it was not an OLR Guild, we wouldn't have gotten some of our great players, like
3188520	3193280	Eddie is on there, and Aliestor or whatever plays it.
3193280	3196120	Two people.
3196120	3199660	And then a bunch of people will join and level their characters to five, and then we never
3199660	3200800	see them again.
3200800	3204480	So we've had like two or three that have stuck with it, but that's about it.
3204480	3207840	I'm there, but I just don't play that much.
3207840	3210240	Speaking of people who leveled to level five and then quit.
3210240	3213680	No, I will add to eight with my team, and then I started...
3213680	3214680	Oh, sorry, eight.
3214680	3215840	Okay, okay, okay.
3215840	3220840	I will play World of Warcraft on some day.
3220840	3222760	And DMN sent me a private message.
3222760	3225520	Tell me, Glattov, I quit WoW.
3225520	3226920	Then I'm sad.
3226920	3231560	All right, anyway, sorry AZHP has been waiting on the line very patiently, you poor bastard.
3231560	3234040	What's on your mind?
3234040	3238680	Speaking of WoW, after I got off the phone last week with you guys, you said that I might
3238680	3243200	have bought this budget computer for WoW, and no, I'm not a WoW player.
3243200	3244200	Really?
3244200	3248880	Oh, because that's right, you emailed us, and we said something about you had the budget...
3248880	3250920	You said something about buying a budget computer, right?
3250920	3255040	Yeah, well, I Skyped in last week, and I said that I bought a budget computer, and you thought
3255040	3260920	that it was for WoW, and no, I've seen what WoW does to my friends, and I don't want to
3260920	3262840	become a recovering WoW addict.
3262840	3265640	Ironic that we're yelling about WoW the minute you call in.
3265640	3267680	That's why you were snickering to yourself.
3267680	3269560	Is that all you wanted to say?
3269560	3274920	No, well, I didn't catch the mailbag this week.
3274920	3276480	You guys read my email?
3276480	3278800	I don't know, maybe.
3278800	3281680	We read a lot of emails, so I don't know if we...
3281680	3283280	I think I heard your name come up.
3283280	3284520	All right, awesome.
3284520	3285520	Well, yeah.
3285520	3289480	You know, you could always just download part A, and then you'll find out.
3289480	3296080	Well, yeah, I played the Bioshock demo, and I was looking at picking it up, because it's
3296080	3297080	so awesome, right?
3297080	3299240	Oh, yeah, we read this email, yeah.
3299240	3304720	Yeah, and I just read a lot of controversy on the forums, like, oh, if you buy the game,
3304720	3310960	you can only register it on two computers, and after that, your CD won't work anymore
3310960	3313400	on any other computers that you have.
3313400	3317480	That and your computer will be reported to the Motion Picture Association of America.
3317480	3321440	Why they do that, I don't know, but it's just more negative stuff to happen.
3321440	3326360	And little gnomes will come live inside your computer, and if you don't feed them before
3326360	3328600	midnight, then your computer will grow legs and walk away.
3328600	3331960	I mean, the coffee protection on Bioshock is just that bad.
3331960	3337660	Yeah, actually, people have said that rootkits were installed, like the Sony's old rootkits
3337660	3343000	that pretty much just monitored everything on your computer, so I'm thinking of waiting
3343000	3349320	until that stuff gets all settled down, people start throwing lawsuits at 2K and stuff, more
3349320	3350320	lawsuits.
3350320	3354420	Yes, and actually, Big Brother is watching your computer and sending daily reports to
3354420	3357160	Amber who's crying about them right now.
3357160	3358160	Bad joke, sorry.
3358160	3360040	If you get that, you need a life like I do.
3360040	3363400	See, Miklotov's booing me, I know he needs it, all right.
3363400	3366520	Anything else you want to share, ACHP?
3366520	3371440	Probably, but it all got lost in the randomness, so I guess that's about it.
3371440	3375600	That's like the tagline of this show, it all gets lost in the randomness, so there you
3375600	3376600	go.
3376600	3377600	That is pretty excellent.
3377600	3379880	Oh, actually, one more thing.
3379880	3380880	Yes.
3380880	3386200	Yeah, about the Wii outselling the Xbox 360, and you guys are all wondering, oh, it's not
3386200	3390400	the hardcore gamers who's buying all the stuff for it, it's just Wii Sports, Wii Play.
3390400	3391480	Well, it's a mix.
3391480	3392480	It's a mix.
3392480	3393480	Yeah.
3393480	3395360	I mean, keep in mind we were reading some chat comments there, too.
3395360	3396360	I think it's a mix.
3396360	3400040	I think you've got both the hardcore gamers and soccer moms buying it, and that's why
3400040	3405440	it's doing so well, but I think for a lot of hardcore gamers, the magic is dying off,
3405440	3409280	you know, and hopefully, Metroid is going to bring that back, and Super Smash Brothers
3409280	3414840	certainly will bring that back, but, you know, I feel like it's the DS launch all over again,
3414840	3415840	really.
3415840	3416840	It's the DS launch all over again.
3416840	3420540	You had a bunch of great games at the beginning, and then, like, a year of deadness with the
3420540	3423960	occasional gem, and now we're going to get back into overdrive.
3423960	3429120	Yeah, I mean, like, from next week until four months from now, we've got, like, great releases
3429120	3430480	coming every month.
3430480	3434940	You got Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Brothers.
3434940	3436960	You got Battalion Wars.
3436960	3438920	Everything's just, like, coming out one after another.
3438920	3441080	Well, it's about freaking time, right?
3441080	3442080	Yeah, definitely.
3442080	3443080	All right.
3443080	3444080	All right.
3444080	3445080	I haven't touched...
3445080	3446880	I haven't bought a new game for my Wii since Ellipitz.
3446880	3450640	I mean, the last one I bought was Super Paper Mario, and I barely played it.
3450640	3454080	I feel like a dummy for even buying it, because I barely played it, but...
3454080	3455080	Oh, well.
3455080	3456080	All right.
3456080	3457080	Well, AZHP, thanks so much for the call.
3457080	3458640	We've got to go and wrap things up, okay?
3458640	3459640	All right, then.
3459640	3460640	All right.
3460640	3461640	Later, sir.
3461640	3462640	Bye.
3462640	3463640	All right.
3463640	3464640	That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
3464640	3465760	If you didn't get through, so sorry, but try again next week.
3465760	3469840	We had some long calls tonight that kind of took up all our time, so if you're mad we
3469840	3473440	didn't get to your call, just blame Insanus, because his call went on for about nine minutes.
3473440	3474440	All right.
3474440	3475440	Just kidding.
3475440	3479480	Let's get to the listless results, shall we, before we get to the last-minute stories,
3479480	3482160	because you still had some last-minute stories, right, Loki?
3482160	3483160	Yes.
3483160	3485280	Maybe Dark Sakura has a few as well?
3485280	3486280	Yeah, no.
3486280	3487280	All right.
3487280	3488280	Yeah, no.
3488280	3489480	All right.
3489480	3491200	Let's get to tonight's listless results.
3491200	3496240	In third place for the character we would most like to see in the new track and field
3496240	3502480	game, Dracula is the character that people would like to see third most in their DDR
3502480	3503480	game.
3503480	3510320	In second place for a character that we most want to see in track and field, Mr. Spanky
3510320	3516640	comes in second place, and what could possibly top Mr. Spanky for the number one character
3516640	3520720	you most want to see in track and field on the DS?
3520720	3524160	The left DDR arrow is the number one.
3524160	3525160	Yay.
3525160	3528240	So make it happen, Konami.
3528240	3529560	That's the first time I've ever won.
3529560	3530560	I'm so excited.
3530560	3532840	How many listless games have you played with us?
3532840	3534840	Like ten, probably.
3534840	3536960	Well, congratulations.
3536960	3540280	Poor Loki in Dark Sakura got X'd out that round.
3540280	3541280	I'm sorry.
3541280	3542280	Kids?
3542280	3543280	Oh, well.
3543280	3545880	That's okay, because of several times I've won the entire thing by myself.
3545880	3547920	Well, of several times.
3547920	3548920	Shut up.
3548920	3551680	Why are you being mean to me?
3551680	3553280	Because you let me.
3553280	3554520	Heart.
3554520	3556160	Hearts make it better.
3556160	3557720	Don't throw napkins at me.
3557720	3558720	That will just make me meaner.
3558720	3560000	Yes, make it tough.
3560000	3564960	I realized like ten minutes ago that it would have been better to do the right DDR arrow
3564960	3568480	because it's pointing in the direction of like the running on the screen.
3568480	3571480	The left DDR arrow makes even less sense now that I think about it.
3571480	3572760	It makes you run away.
3572760	3574320	But it makes it funnier.
3574320	3580160	Anyway, Loki, last minute stories.
3580160	3587240	So there was some other stuff other than the Eye of Judgment announced for the PlayStation
3587240	3588720	Eye.
3588720	3594120	One of which is the Towers of Topac, which is apparently a game where you roll around
3594120	3597960	this giant ball down this tower using your body.
3597960	3600560	Sounds like a shitload of fun.
3600560	3601560	Hurrah.
3601560	3606880	I will use the Eye of Judgment to roll a giant ball down a hill is what you're saying.
3606880	3607880	Something like that.
3607880	3610400	That sounds like totem ball.
3610400	3611780	I love totem ball.
3611780	3613880	It's not exactly a totem ball.
3613880	3619040	Basically it's a top down view and each of the little platforms that you're on is actually
3619040	3620920	an image of your screen.
3620920	3624560	So you actually are on multiple little platforms there.
3624560	3625560	I don't know.
3625560	3626560	It's weird.
3626560	3630120	Not something I would buy though.
3630120	3631120	Let's see here.
3631120	3639080	Also, Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, which is rumored to be out this year, according to an interview
3639080	3645760	with some people working the Sony booth at Lipsig, that actually I guess with the series
3645760	3654240	creator Kazunori Yamauchi has confirmed himself.
3654240	3659800	He said that yes, it will be a free download on the PSN and we're thinking of charging,
3659800	3660800	but doubt it.
3660800	3662640	For now it's free.
3662640	3666520	So I think it was actually supposed to contain quite a bit of stuff.
3666520	3673440	They were saying, I want to say it was like quite a few cars and about 16 tracks or something
3673440	3674440	like that.
3674440	3676020	I think it was like 50 cars.
3676020	3679000	So that would be pretty sweet if it was free.
3679000	3681520	Then I wouldn't have to buy the actual game.
3681520	3686040	Anyways, let's see.
3686040	3692380	Other than that, there was one other thing I was going to say that they've partially
3692380	3697000	cracked the Xbox 360 kernel.
3697000	3703520	Now that allows you to download or downgrade from any kernel without using a computer key
3703520	3704520	is possible.
3704520	3712680	So what that'll allow you to do is drop your firmware down to a level where you can put
3712680	3714760	homebrew stuff on it.
3714760	3718360	Not fully functional, but getting close.
3718360	3719680	All right.
3719680	3721040	Is that it?
3721040	3722040	That's it.
3722040	3723040	All right.
3723040	3724440	Lots of last minute stories tonight.
3724440	3727200	Well, that's about it for the show tonight.
3727200	3729960	Thank you guys so much for tuning into us and listening to us tonight.
3729960	3731320	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
3731320	3733840	Miklotov, thank you for being here.
3733840	3735840	I didn't have a choice.
3735840	3739040	Are you going to be here next week for our maybe drunk show?
3739040	3741000	I don't think I have a choice.
3741000	3745440	Well, I'm glad you have such enthusiasm with this program.
3745440	3749080	Maybe I'll lift my ban on drinking for myself.
3749080	3750800	That would be fun.
3750800	3754080	I think we might have to do a drunk show after all.
3754080	3755560	So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
3755560	3758080	Miklotov, your final thought.
3758080	3759680	I don't know.
3759680	3762840	Loki, your final thought.
3762840	3769100	My final thought is they had some people, I guess, at Leipzig that were just completely
3769100	3771900	naked except they were painted on.
3771900	3774200	That's what we need to see at E3.
3774200	3775200	Painted chicks.
3775200	3777020	They're topless.
3777020	3782240	My final thought is Mike and Ike's are yummy and I just found one left in the bag.
3782240	3783960	Delicious.
3783960	3785480	Dark Soccer, your final thought.
3785480	3786480	Gross.
3786480	3787480	You don't like Mike and Ike's?
3787480	3792360	They're one of the candies I can't eat because I'm allergic to one of the ingredients.
3792360	3793600	It's like a gelatin something.
3793600	3798680	Same with Starburst and gum makes me nauseous when I smell it.
3798680	3802080	I'm trying to figure out what the name of the ingredient would be.
3802080	3804760	It's something like Jamie Repellent.
3804760	3805760	Jamie Repellent.
3805760	3806760	Oh, look.
3806760	3807760	It's right in there.
3807760	3808760	Jamie Repellent number five.
3808760	3809760	Who knew?
3809760	3810760	All right.
3810760	3813680	Of course, thanks you guys so much for tuning in to and downloading our show or tuning in

3822560	3823880	Tell two people about your show.
3823880	3827520	They don't have to be your friends because we'll take your enemies listening to the show
3827520	3829720	too because we just like to get the word out.
3829720	3833600	We don't get a lot of money to promote our program so we rely on word of mouth.
3833600	3837600	Please leave your reviews on iTunes and get the word out there and all that good stuff.
3837600	3839080	We appreciate it.
