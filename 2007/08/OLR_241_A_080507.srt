1
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:33,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet.

2
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:36,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:43,655
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:46,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, our show is a little bit broken tonight.

5
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:52,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we were off for a week due to a studio move, meaning that the studio we used to record in is no more.

6
00:00:52,798 --> 00:00:53,378
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone.

7
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're actually in a temporary location tonight.

8
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,039
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it Studio Loki.

9
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and it's brought to us by the one and only Techmaster Loki, who's also here on the program tonight.

10
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:03,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

11
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:04,861
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Loki?

12
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:09,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing okay, and I'm still trying to untangle this microphone cord, but that's okay.

13
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,223
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

14
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:17,566
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you notice some things are a little bit different tonight, like our opening was not its usual self and some other things, the sound might be a little bit different than what you're used to.

15
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:19,507
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why, because we're in our temporary home.

16
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,007
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

17
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Xtifer Xtifer

18
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:17,151
[SPEAKER_03]: She should be back next week with us here at Orange Lounge Radio, but I know the listeners and ourselves were all thinking of her and her family this week.

19
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:20,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, let's talk about what's going on with the show.

20
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:28,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that basically we moved, and of course the show taped out of the spare bedroom at the apartment I used to share with Extifer.

21
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:32,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've moved on and Extifer's moved and I've moved into a new house.

22
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:36,757
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cool thing is that we're going to tape out of the garage now, so it's going to be like this huge studio, but here's the problem.

23
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:44,496
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried to call Comcast to get an appointment a week before we moved, just after we taped the last show, and they said they would not come out until August 7th.

24
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:46,458
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were screwed with no internet at the house.

25
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:49,741
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been hell trying to have internet at the house for this week.

26
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:50,762
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been nothing.

27
00:02:50,822 --> 00:02:51,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Stolen Wi-Fi, that's it.

28
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:54,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And we couldn't broadcast a show off of stolen Wi-Fi.

29
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:56,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to move to a temporary home this week.

30
00:02:56,887 --> 00:02:58,469
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we're at Studio Loki tonight.

31
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,070
[SPEAKER_03]: And things are a little crazy.

32
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:02,184
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's okay.

33
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:03,845
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't want to go two weeks of not having a show.

34
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:09,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because we seriously considered it because of everything going on with Jamie and going on at the other studio.

35
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:15,271
[SPEAKER_03]: But we just didn't want to have to go two weeks with no show because that can sometimes be suicide for listeners and everything.

36
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,112
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate those of you guys sticking with us.

37
00:03:17,512 --> 00:03:18,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we are in chat.

38
00:03:18,452 --> 00:03:19,133
[SPEAKER_03]: We have everything up.

39
00:03:19,213 --> 00:03:20,833
[SPEAKER_03]: We should hopefully still have Skype line tonight.

40
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:23,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to join us in the chat room.

41
00:03:24,635 --> 00:03:26,215
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, lots of gaming news tonight.

42
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:32,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's got something really big he wants to talk about in Part B. It's going to be really cool, so we'll talk about that a little later.

43
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:35,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get into How Was Your Gaming Week?

44
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:38,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll start off, How Was Your Gaming Week, Loki?

45
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Extremely busy.

46
00:03:41,398 --> 00:03:43,518
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically how I can describe it.

47
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:49,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played so much crap over the last few days, or actually the last couple weeks, that it's just ridiculous.

48
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's start off with the PSP stuff.

49
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:58,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back and played through a little bit more of WTF and that game is weird.

50
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:01,510
[SPEAKER_02]: The more games I unlock, the weirder the game gets.

51
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:03,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome though.

52
00:04:04,274 --> 00:04:05,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend checking it out.

53
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:06,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably dirt cheap by now.

54
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, another game I played actually just came out in the UK called State Shift.

55
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:14,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a kind of a futuristic racing game.

56
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:20,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess a little bit like Wipeout, but it's, you know, with cars or these futuristic vehicles.

57
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:22,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, didn't care for it too much.

58
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:29,271
[SPEAKER_02]: The cars drive like, you know, giant bricks with rockets on them, and it was impossible to make corners and stuff.

59
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:33,393
[SPEAKER_02]: So, not a game I'd pick up, but then again, I'm not in the UK, so it doesn't matter.

60
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:34,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

61
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:43,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy, I finished it finally, and I'm so glad I'm finished with it because those new dungeons that they added on with the PlayStation 1 release, just crap.

62
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:47,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, oh, we need some dungeons, quick, let's make some.

63
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:50,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and they have no continuity whatsoever, just crap.

64
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:53,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was so pissed off at the game, so that's done.

65
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:57,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 2 I played it for about 5 minutes, turned it off because I didn't want to play it anymore.

66
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,934
[SPEAKER_02]: The battle system is just not good.

67
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:01,275
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

68
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:02,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Final Fantasy 2.

69
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it on the Game Boy Advance a lot.

70
00:05:04,198 --> 00:05:04,759
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't like it?

71
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it.

72
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:11,347
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for me though, I think Final Fantasy 11 takes a lot from Final Fantasy 2.

73
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:20,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Final Fantasy 2.

74
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:22,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's more fun than Final Fantasy 1.

75
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:23,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to play the PSP port.

76
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:25,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, so you have Final Fantasy 2 on PSP?

77
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:26,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

78
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:26,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're not playing it?

79
00:05:27,157 --> 00:05:27,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

80
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:29,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you should let me have it for a little while.

81
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:30,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be fun.

82
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no internet at home.

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Take pity on me.

84
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:32,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

85
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:33,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

86
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:56,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond the PSP, on the 360 I played quite a few things, including some demos I tried the demo for Beautiful Katamari, which a lot of people don't know is actually out there It's not on live, but if you happen to subscribe to the official Xbox magazine There is a demo disc for Beautiful Katamari in the September issue

87
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:57,803
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

88
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:27,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm pretty surprised.

89
00:06:28,376 --> 00:06:29,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing it quite a bit.

90
00:06:30,377 --> 00:06:36,222
[SPEAKER_02]: At first, you're like, well, maybe it should be slightly good because then the townsfolk will help you out with stuff.

91
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:41,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Then eventually, they start pissing you off, and I think that they programmed that game that way on purpose.

92
00:06:42,306 --> 00:06:46,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just go through the towns and basically kill everybody, and I can do that over and over.

93
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got my wenches, and it's awesome.

94
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:53,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, let's see...

95
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:58,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I also, on the PlayStation 3, I got my import copy of Wengen Midnight.

96
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:00,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty cool.

97
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:04,295
[SPEAKER_02]: The game itself, though, graphically, looks like a PlayStation 2 game.

98
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:06,636
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably the only disappointing thing about it.

99
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:10,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you know, I guess it's exactly like the arcade game.

100
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:16,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they were originally building it for PlayStation 2 and just decided to... It came out for PlayStation 2, like, last year.

101
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:22,600
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not... I mean, the graphics, if you were to put it up against, like, you know, Need for Speed or...

102
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember those are basically the main things

103
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:53,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

104
00:07:54,593 --> 00:08:00,255
[SPEAKER_03]: MyGamingWeek, and I'm looking at chatroom at chat.orangelandredo.com JVmon says, Sky must be dying without World of Warcraft.

105
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:04,776
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wasn't until I heard all the news from BlizzCon this week, which we'll get into in a little bit.

106
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:06,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Nextfer's going to give us a report because he was there at BlizzCon.

107
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:11,417
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when I heard all of that, I was like, I have to get my character to 70.

108
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:15,878
[SPEAKER_03]: But before BlizzCon happened, I was doing okay with no World of Warcraft.

109
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:16,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was busy moving.

110
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:18,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, when you have all this...

111
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff you gotta get out of another place, and believe me, I have a lot of crap, okay?

112
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of crap.

113
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:26,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So moving that kind of kept me busy and kept my mind off WoW.

114
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:31,148
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I did finally get everything settled in and I had no internet, that didn't leave a whole lot to play.

115
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:36,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went back to old PlayStation 2 games that I never really finished, and the first one that came to mind was Kingdom Hearts 2.

116
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:41,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I played that game quite a ways in before the first time I played it, and then just kind of stopped.

117
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:45,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just restarting that, and I pretty much caught up to where I was, and...

118
00:08:46,198 --> 00:09:01,322
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Kingdom Hearts 2, yeah, I guess its biggest downfall is that the battle system is kind of a bit of button mashing, and it's nothing that intuitive, but I'll be damned if you don't just kind of immerse yourself in the world, and the way they tie things together is so great, and the voice acting is pretty darn good, except for Aerith, I hate her.

119
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:06,963
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything else, the music and the graphics and the full motions, it's a great game.

120
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:08,504
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my favorite PlayStation 2 games.

121
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:10,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the other game I played.

122
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:11,325
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

123
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:12,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3.

124
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:13,505
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the demo for that.

125
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:13,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the demo?

126
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:14,126
[SPEAKER_02]: How was that?

127
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:26,670
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very short, again, but it kind of reminds me a little bit of God of War, but it's a whole lot of button mashing, it seems like, because it's basically two buttons that you do certain moves with, and you can switch your weapon up a little bit.

128
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,591
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.

129
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:34,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably going to pick it up just because there's not a whole lot coming out for the PlayStation 3, so it's worth my money.

130
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:38,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting comment.

131
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:43,638
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, Kingdom Hearts 3 should use something along the lines of Final Fantasy XII.

132
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:48,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XII did have a pretty awesome battle system, but I don't know if it would work in the Kingdom Hearts universe.

133
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:54,493
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people think that Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be different because I believe the creator has said, Kingdom Hearts 3 is not Kingdom Hearts 3.

134
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:57,395
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something else in the Kingdom Hearts universe.

135
00:09:57,616 --> 00:09:58,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we'll see.

136
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,498
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a ways out before they announce anything.

137
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:06,281
[SPEAKER_03]: RavensDolphin in chat says, Sky got so much stuff, moving a lot of gay porn books takes a lot of space.

138
00:10:07,102 --> 00:10:08,603
[SPEAKER_03]: You would know, RavensDolphin, you would.

139
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:12,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Mikotov, how was your gaming week?

140
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:13,626
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of games did you play this week?

141
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:16,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll start with Sunday.

142
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:17,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at Comic Con.

143
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:20,370
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask you to give us the Comic Con reports since you weren't here last week.

144
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:20,811
[SPEAKER_01]: How was that?

145
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:22,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Boring.

146
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:23,453
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like comics.

147
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:30,579
[SPEAKER_01]: I went for Heroes and Battlestar, and I was happy with both of those.

148
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:41,188
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to play Silent Hill Origins, and I haven't played that since it was the behind-the-shoulder camera, and it's actually looking really good, and it was really fun.

149
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:47,094
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't really scary because it's in a bright room with a lot of people, and you're playing it on a PSP.

150
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,115
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever, it was still cool.

151
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:59,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I played World of Warcraft, and I played Loki's demo of Beautiful Katamari, and that's really it.

152
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:01,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you enjoy Beautiful Katamari?

153
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it was a really fun three minutes.

154
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:06,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Best three minutes you ever spent?

155
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,363
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but it was a fun three minutes.

156
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:10,724
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be the best three minutes you ever spent, game-wise?

157
00:11:10,744 --> 00:11:11,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Next question.

158
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:12,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my, alright.

159
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:13,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Game-wise, game-wise.

160
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question.

161
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:17,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine, jerk.

162
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,248
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so that's it for your gaming week?

163
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:20,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

164
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:21,909
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really do much.

165
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I never do much with WoW.

166
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,912
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all been pretty boring between moving and all this other stuff.

167
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:28,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Having my office closed.

168
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:29,173
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

169
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:30,533
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been moving out of your office.

170
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:31,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

171
00:11:31,214 --> 00:11:31,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Is everything okay?

172
00:11:31,914 --> 00:11:32,534
[SPEAKER_03]: You doing all right?

173
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

174
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:34,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there any last hurrah?

175
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:36,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Did everybody go out for drinks one last time or anything?

176
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:37,757
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually.

177
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:39,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody went out for drinks.

178
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:39,557
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of sad.

179
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:40,178
[SPEAKER_01]: It was weird.

180
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:40,698
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

181
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:43,079
[SPEAKER_01]: We normally drink for no reason.

182
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,860
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a reason and nobody drank.

183
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:52,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I'm okay to say this on the show, though, but as I understand, there's little bits and pieces that you collected for listeners in the future.

184
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:54,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I'll give those to you to give away.

185
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:59,730
[SPEAKER_03]: So more information at a later date on You Can Own a Piece of What Once Was Konami.

186
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw, that's so sad.

187
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:02,972
[SPEAKER_01]: How sad.

188
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:04,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we laughing?

189
00:12:04,713 --> 00:12:05,214
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

190
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how adorable.

191
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:08,896
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is sad because I know we had a lot of fun.

192
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:09,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

193
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:29,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

194
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:44,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

195
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Next.

196
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:48,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, this is the worst radio.

197
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, DarkTitsui has summed it up in chat.

198
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:51,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst radio ever.

199
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, you're the worst radio ever.

200
00:12:53,434 --> 00:12:56,377
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be the last show from Studio Loki because this is what happens to the show.

201
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,499
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow, housekeeping real quick.

202
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,264
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't here last week, so we weren't able to tell you guys that we got nominated in the podcast awards at podcastawards.com.

203
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you guys very much for helping us to get the nominations.

204
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:09,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And the voting is now open.

205
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:14,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you head on over to www.podcastwards.com, you can vote for Orange Launch Radio.

206
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:16,096
[SPEAKER_03]: We're nominated for Best Gaming Podcast.

207
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really cool because lots of independent podcasts are nominated.

208
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,404
[SPEAKER_03]: They upped it from 5 to 10 this year, and there's lots of independent podcasts nominated.

209
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:25,567
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of good shows, including our good buddies at All Games.

210
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:26,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are...

211
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:29,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

212
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:52,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit those confirmation emails.

213
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:53,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do it legitimately.

214
00:13:53,478 --> 00:13:53,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't cheat.

215
00:13:54,238 --> 00:13:55,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It is legitimate.

216
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, it gives us a bad name.

217
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:58,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It is legitimate.

218
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying for the people out there.

219
00:13:59,400 --> 00:13:59,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

220
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Be legit and ethical.

221
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying use a program to do it or anything.

222
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:03,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't.

223
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:09,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, you know, if you have email addresses, you can vote four times.

224
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:11,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, people that...

225
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:18,296
[SPEAKER_03]: People that are listening to gaming podcasts are probably so fucking sick about hearing about podcast awards.

226
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:21,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was just nice to be nominated again.

227
00:14:21,418 --> 00:14:22,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, blah, blah, blah.

228
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,760
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always lovely to be nominated.

229
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,683
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want to win again, so... You know what's better than being nominated again?

230
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:28,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Winning again.

231
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:30,004
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's even better.

232
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:31,746
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just teasing, really.

233
00:14:31,846 --> 00:14:33,867
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it really is great that we got nominated.

234
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:36,609
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that there's a lot of shows that haven't been in there before.

235
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all independent.

236
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I hoard us out to my work again.

237
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:40,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Those people...

238
00:14:40,692 --> 00:14:48,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Those people that do the shows that got nominated, you know, they don't get a lot of, I don't think any of them, I don't think any of them get paid to do their business.

239
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,861
[SPEAKER_02]: ScrewAttack was on there.

240
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:50,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they?

241
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:51,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

242
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:52,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know.

243
00:14:52,304 --> 00:14:55,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're affiliated with, you know, GameTrailers.com.

244
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:55,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

245
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:57,381
[SPEAKER_02]: We need this!

246
00:14:57,401 --> 00:14:57,841
[SPEAKER_02]: We need this!

247
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:19,927
[SPEAKER_03]: HURRAY FOR NOMINATIONS

248
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:42,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Wrath of the Lich King Wrath of the Don King

249
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:10,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though there's going to be no new races, there is going to be a new class, Death Knight.

250
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:12,475
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of fun.

251
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:14,396
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently every race can be a Death Knight.

252
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:15,897
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's going to be lots of Death Knights.

253
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:19,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've already reserved the name Death Cake so you can't have it for Death Knight.

254
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:29,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was just going to say, you know, if you were like, say, Leroy Jenkins and he was a knight, he would be a Death Knight because he's dead in the game because he got killed.

255
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:29,646
[SPEAKER_02]: How funny.

256
00:16:30,486 --> 00:16:39,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, what's not funny though is the fact that you may need Burning Crusade in order to play some aspects of Wrath of the Lich King.

257
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:49,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is not surprising because I think with Burning Crusade it did raise the level cap and obviously you're not going to be able to go to 80 if you don't have Burning Crusade.

258
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:56,743
[SPEAKER_02]: But they haven't really said exactly what will not be available if you don't have Burning Crusade.

259
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:05,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Well also, it should be pointed out, there's some new battlegrounds and it's going to have siege warfare and buildings that you can destroy with your siege weapons, so that's going to be pretty awesome.

260
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:09,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And then supposedly you're going to be able to customize your characters even further than what you can do now.

261
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, new hair, I can't wait.

262
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:12,769
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good because it is kind of limited right now.

263
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,311
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what the best thing so far about the expansion is?

264
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:15,612
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

265
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:17,553
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blue, like crazy.

266
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:18,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot wait.

267
00:17:18,934 --> 00:17:20,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's ice and cold and all that stuff.

268
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:22,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's snowy and I'm so excited.

269
00:17:22,857 --> 00:17:26,780
[SPEAKER_01]: I could talk for hours about it, but I guess that's Christopher's job because he went there.

270
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's talk to Christopher.

271
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:29,862
[SPEAKER_03]: How was BlizzCon, Christopher?

272
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:30,923
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, how did you go?

273
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a birthday thing, right?

274
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:34,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my sister got it for me for my birthday.

275
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:34,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was sweet.

276
00:17:35,307 --> 00:17:36,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And didn't think to invite us.

277
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:36,948
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

278
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:37,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

279
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:38,509
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.

280
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:39,730
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's $100 per ticket.

281
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have bought it.

282
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:41,432
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have bought it.

283
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:42,492
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we were moving.

284
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:43,053
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.

285
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:46,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, tell us about what was it like when he got there?

286
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:47,456
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of stuff did they have going on?

287
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:54,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got there pretty early in the morning on Friday morning because we wanted to get our badges.

288
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:55,163
[SPEAKER_00]: And

289
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:56,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

290
00:18:12,168 --> 00:18:13,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Waited for the doors to open.

291
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:14,109
[SPEAKER_00]: They opened the doors.

292
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:17,991
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walked in, it was really dark.

293
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:23,595
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see the main hall, which is where they announced the expansion.

294
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:25,916
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in bright blue.

295
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:27,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay, blue.

296
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:32,640
[SPEAKER_00]: They had two big screens and a lot of chairs.

297
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:39,364
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was just, you know, and even everybody filled up the chairs and people were standing on the sidelines.

298
00:18:39,404 --> 00:18:41,365
[SPEAKER_00]: People were blocking everybody's view and

299
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:43,124
[SPEAKER_00]: The opening ceremony was pretty good.

300
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:49,589
[SPEAKER_00]: They talked about a lot of stuff, StarCraft II, World of Warcraft, and they showed us the trailer to the expansion, and that was pretty cool.

301
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:50,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody knew StarCraft

302
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:17,466
[SPEAKER_00]: The expansion was going to be called Wrath of the Lich King because in our maps it said there was a specific area that said World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King area.

303
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:21,346
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody was clued in as to what was coming.

304
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:23,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, plus it had been leaked to the internet like two days before.

305
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:29,008
[SPEAKER_03]: While you all were driving down, the whole internet knew thanks to some European thing.

306
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the official Blizzard site in Europe or something leaked it.

307
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they had the whole FAQ that's up now.

308
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:37,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, still some people were skeptical.

309
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:41,214
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought it was going to be Maelstrom, but I don't know.

310
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:44,477
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wrath of the Lich King, we got to play it three times.

311
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:47,799
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, I really liked it.

312
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,201
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the demo like?

313
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:49,801
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do in it?

314
00:19:50,302 --> 00:19:54,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you start out in the Undercity area and you fly on a...

315
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:57,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that is.

316
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:01,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I think your computer just farted.

317
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:11,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, for those people not in the studio, that's the pipes from someone next door they're using and there's air in the pipes.

318
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:13,094
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a cool noise.

319
00:20:13,134 --> 00:20:14,114
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a Silent Hill noise.

320
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:14,774
[SPEAKER_03]: That was freaky.

321
00:20:14,815 --> 00:20:16,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish the folks at home could hear that.

322
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,116
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so expansion.

323
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got to play the expansion.

324
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,905
[SPEAKER_00]: We start out in Undercity, ride a Zeppelin to the new Northrend area.

325
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:28,269
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really know where it is in Northrend, but just that it's in Northrend.

326
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,875
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the Howling Fjord or whatever, is that right?

327
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's correct.

328
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,237
[SPEAKER_00]: I just couldn't remember.

329
00:20:35,377 --> 00:20:39,399
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so many names that you discovered in the expansion we didn't know where we were.

330
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:44,521
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much you go to this grassy type area first.

331
00:20:44,982 --> 00:20:47,763
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a town and you're next to the ocean.

332
00:20:48,223 --> 00:20:50,344
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go up.

333
00:20:51,045 --> 00:20:53,146
[SPEAKER_00]: You ride this lift up to the top.

334
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:57,388
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually in the trailer for Wrath of the Lich King you see the top of the lift.

335
00:20:57,808 --> 00:21:01,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of excited because you're playing a part that's in the trailer.

336
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can go to the right.

337
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:11,674
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of snowy area you can go into, and then there was a lot of burning woodsy areas.

338
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:12,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, too much detail.

339
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they let you play Death Knight?

340
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:22,039
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they don't let you play Death Knight, but they did play that trailer over and over and over and over again.

341
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get to do anything in the demo that you can't really already do in WoW right now?

342
00:21:26,516 --> 00:21:28,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's nothing really new.

343
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:32,486
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do quests, but they weren't really new.

344
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:35,030
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell that they were holding off on that stuff.

345
00:21:35,572 --> 00:21:38,094
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really kind of a way to explore the area.

346
00:21:38,134 --> 00:21:39,815
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a dungeon you can go to.

347
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,397
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lots of nerds could go.

348
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:45,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I played it first before any of you did in my murloc suit.

349
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I would say it was a good start.

350
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:49,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Good effort.

351
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:50,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good effort.

352
00:21:51,164 --> 00:22:03,034
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't like you couldn't go to the other areas that were already there because one of our players is a mage who can portal you and he portaled us to another city and it was kind of cool because we were the only three people there.

353
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:04,475
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it was kind of cool.

354
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:05,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

355
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:06,918
[SPEAKER_03]: How about StarCraft 2?

356
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:07,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get a chance to play that?

357
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:08,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

358
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:15,586
[SPEAKER_00]: StarCraft 2, I've never played StarCraft before, let alone any game like StarCraft, so I was new to the whole genre.

359
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:19,530
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can say that I really liked it.

360
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,092
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed it.

361
00:22:21,893 --> 00:22:24,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good graphics, lots of detail.

362
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:28,480
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

363
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:43,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

364
00:22:58,232 --> 00:22:59,293
[SPEAKER_00]: There were families there.

365
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:05,076
[SPEAKER_00]: There were people that were fat and nasty there.

366
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:07,637
[SPEAKER_00]: There were nerds, just like skinny, scrawny nerds.

367
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,098
[SPEAKER_00]: There were hot people.

368
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:12,400
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people dressed in Blood Elf costumes.

369
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you were saying before that Leroy Jenkins, the guy that does Leroy Jenkins, he was there.

370
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,043
[SPEAKER_03]: He was there.

371
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:21,765
[SPEAKER_03]: You were like wetting your pants over that guy.

372
00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:26,067
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually... Okay, Jay Moore, who is kind of the DJ...

373
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,629
[SPEAKER_00]: of the whole event.

374
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:30,751
[SPEAKER_00]: He did like a last comic standing, right?

375
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

376
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Before he got fired.

377
00:23:34,054 --> 00:23:36,556
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually did a really good job.

378
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:43,862
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some hecklers that kind of derailed the closing ceremony for a little bit, but he pulled it together.

379
00:23:44,062 --> 00:23:45,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was laughing.

380
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:47,525
[SPEAKER_00]: He made even the most skeptical people.

381
00:23:47,585 --> 00:23:49,247
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one girl behind me that was

382
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:52,188
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Dark Knight in chat wants to know, were there Korean players there?

383
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:53,688
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's no Jamie Kennedy, that's for sure.

384
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:31,275
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there were Korean players there, mostly for StarCraft, but there were people that won the costume contests in the Korean Invitational that they did a few months ago, or a month ago or whatever.

385
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:42,077
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually participated in the costume contest this year, and it was a warlock, and they were done very well, but it just so happens there was another warlock that topped them, and she was just incredible.

386
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:45,218
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, oh my god, she looked incredible.

387
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:53,143
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the Leroy Jenkins guy was there, and he did his Leroy Jenkins, and he was just too hot for words.

388
00:24:53,203 --> 00:24:53,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, nerdy.

389
00:24:54,464 --> 00:24:55,365
[SPEAKER_00]: How was Video Games Live?

390
00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:56,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

391
00:24:57,073 --> 00:25:01,815
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft, as you can imagine.

392
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,376
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also... Yeah, that's the one in one.

393
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:03,756
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

394
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:14,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, they did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft, but they also did the new music from StarCraft II, which was sucky because it sounded exactly like Star Wars.

395
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:19,365
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got to hear that, and we got to hear lots of music from Diablo.

396
00:25:20,266 --> 00:25:24,408
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was also a band that played last night called...

397
00:25:25,008 --> 00:25:26,589
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like this horde band.

398
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,870
[SPEAKER_00]: It was totally manufactured by the makers of WoW.

399
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:30,971
[SPEAKER_00]: You could tell because the creator of WoW was in the band.

400
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:33,952
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, they were funny.

401
00:25:33,972 --> 00:25:34,552
[SPEAKER_00]: What were they called?

402
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:34,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Level 70?

403
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:37,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Level 70 Elite Torrin Chieftain.

404
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:39,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they actually dress up like Torrin?

405
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:40,695
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they actually didn't.

406
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:41,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they were Gwar or something?

407
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:42,515
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't.

408
00:25:42,555 --> 00:25:42,855
[SPEAKER_00]: That sucks.

409
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,657
[SPEAKER_00]: But they did, when you went and waited in the line to play Wrath of the Lich King...

410
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:52,179
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a big screen next to them, and they kept playing the video that was game-made.

411
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:58,943
[SPEAKER_00]: They made it in-game video for that, and it was just incredibly ridiculous, but it was funny, I guess.

412
00:26:00,023 --> 00:26:07,607
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have a song called Rogues Do It From Behind, which was just funny, because I'm a rogue, and I do it from behind.

413
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:10,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just threw up in my mouth.

414
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:11,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

415
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:12,414
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going for that.

416
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:16,735
[SPEAKER_01]: If only there was a camera to capture everybody's expressions just then.

417
00:26:17,516 --> 00:26:20,476
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, the whole show was pretty good.

418
00:26:20,516 --> 00:26:21,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I had such a fun time.

419
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:22,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Good deal.

420
00:26:23,037 --> 00:26:25,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to share that you think our listeners ought to know about?

421
00:26:25,658 --> 00:26:27,158
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the funniest thing that happened all show?

422
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:28,279
[SPEAKER_00]: The funniest thing?

423
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:28,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

424
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:30,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God.

425
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:32,980
[SPEAKER_00]: All the nerds asking stupid questions at the panels.

426
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:38,649
[SPEAKER_00]: They would say stuff like, okay, we're not going to answer these questions, and what do the nerds fucking do?

427
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,030
[SPEAKER_00]: They ask those fucking questions.

428
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:40,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us an example.

429
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:41,912
[SPEAKER_00]: The movie panel, you said was one, right?

430
00:26:41,952 --> 00:26:42,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Movie panel, okay.

431
00:26:42,632 --> 00:26:43,493
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big thing.

432
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:45,354
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually doing a movie.

433
00:26:45,414 --> 00:26:54,901
[SPEAKER_00]: The same people who did Batman Begins, Superman Returns, Legendary 300, or whatever.

434
00:26:55,682 --> 00:27:00,065
[SPEAKER_00]: They are doing the movie, and they are really standing by this film.

435
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:01,526
[SPEAKER_00]: There was...

436
00:27:02,307 --> 00:27:14,983
[SPEAKER_00]: There were questions that they wouldn't answer though, and that was, those were, we won't answer questions on which races, which characters will be in the movies, but you can expect to maybe see these, and they listed these characters, right?

437
00:27:15,363 --> 00:27:16,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody cheered.

438
00:27:16,957 --> 00:27:20,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Dark Knight wants to know, he would have asked, and will we be hearing Back Me Wool?

439
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:43,103
[SPEAKER_03]: In the movie, anywhere.

440
00:27:43,363 --> 00:27:43,823
[SPEAKER_00]: We should.

441
00:27:44,624 --> 00:27:46,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Dip in the archives if you don't get that joke.

442
00:27:46,525 --> 00:27:49,966
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they said that there's going to be a lot of humor carried over from the game.

443
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:55,349
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking forward to carrying some of the humor, but still keep it on a serious level.

444
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:58,531
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't tell them about what the worst part of the movie is so far.

445
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, they're going to tell it from the Alliance perspective.

446
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:01,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Boo!

447
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:02,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Alliance sucks!

448
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:08,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the funny thing about it is that most people there, we got the feeling that most people there were in the horde.

449
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:14,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is funny, because most people that play the game are Alliance, but they're all kids that can't afford to go to BlizzCon.

450
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:19,119
[SPEAKER_00]: SonOfDad is in chat, wants to know, who's directing the film, did they say?

451
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:21,740
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a director, there was somebody that asked that.

452
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,642
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get the script all together first, before they go search for a director.

453
00:28:28,202 --> 00:28:30,323
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, oh, there was a funny story.

454
00:28:30,763 --> 00:28:54,490
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that is with Legendary said that the guy who played Superman last year, he said they won't go into casting details, but they did say that last year he overheard the Legendary people on the phone with the WoW people, and he said, oh my god, can you get me a backstage tour of where they do WoW and all this stuff, and they did, and he went.

455
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:58,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to remember hearing something about that that guy was a WoW player, the guy who was Superman.

456
00:28:58,551 --> 00:28:58,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

457
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:00,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

458
00:29:11,587 --> 00:29:12,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell-A-Dressel

459
00:29:35,243 --> 00:29:35,623
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.

460
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:36,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that, yeah.

461
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just kind of interesting.

462
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's Asian.

463
00:30:04,101 --> 00:30:04,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

464
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:05,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

465
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at chat, another comment here.

466
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:10,744
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkDeadCity wants to know, will the WoW movie be 60 hours long?

467
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:12,745
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

468
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:15,767
[SPEAKER_00]: They said it's going to be between two and two and a half hours long.

469
00:30:15,907 --> 00:30:22,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yes, it will be 60 hours long, but then you can buy an expansion for just $39.95 that will expand it to 70 hours long.

470
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

471
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,592
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of funny because one of the people on the panel made a comment saying,

472
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:29,212
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

473
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:54,557
[SPEAKER_03]: RossDLUT in chat is like pulling up a pillow and blanket because he just doesn't care about WoW.

474
00:30:55,457 --> 00:30:57,680
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't care about whoever that was that you just said.

475
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about WoW either.

476
00:30:59,361 --> 00:30:59,641
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

477
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you doing okay over there, Loki?

478
00:31:01,303 --> 00:31:02,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing fine.

479
00:31:02,084 --> 00:31:02,264
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

480
00:31:02,284 --> 00:31:03,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's get on to some other news.

481
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:05,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys very much for your respective con reports.

482
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:07,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Mikotov, yours was kind of bad.

483
00:31:07,189 --> 00:31:08,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really care about your report.

484
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,471
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even really talk about it.

485
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:10,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you didn't really do anything.

486
00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:10,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,

487
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:13,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I could talk about it more, but I don't want to, because you're a jerk.

488
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:20,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us really, you know, I don't know, maybe if they don't like World of Warcraft, they like Battlestar, but please tell me about how you met the guy that played Tyrell and what you did.

489
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:23,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, spoilers maybe, just so everybody knows.

490
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:31,322
[SPEAKER_01]: So the guy that plays Tyrell, Aaron Douglas, was at Comic-Con, and I went to go get his autograph.

491
00:31:31,782 --> 00:31:35,024
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went up to him, and I was like, can you write something mean about Callie, like...

492
00:31:35,484 --> 00:31:57,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Callie sucks and Callie is his wife on the show and I absolutely hate her and he laughed at me and then he started signing my thing I gave him to sign and he put Shane or to Shane Aaron Douglas chief I can't wait for Callie to die in season 4 episode 5 dot dot dot that was my favorite thing ever and I have something to look forward to

493
00:31:58,044 --> 00:32:03,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd just like to point out that Shane called me long distance right after this happened just to tell me about this experience.

494
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:04,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's important.

495
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:06,356
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the coolest thing ever.

496
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:08,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Tech5 Tech5

497
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:42,711
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be simultaneously launched on the PC, the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and believe it or not, the Mac.

498
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:54,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, originally when they were showing off the Tech 5 demo, or Tech 5, I guess it was a demonstration of it, they were actually showing off bits of Rage, and it's kind of got a little bit of driving in there.

499
00:32:54,435 --> 00:32:59,637
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bit of first-person shooter stuff in there as well, so it's kind of like Motorstorm meets Quake.

500
00:33:00,817 --> 00:33:04,861
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, here's a quote from Todd Hallenscheid, the CEO of ID Software.

501
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:06,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more than just a first-person shooter.

502
00:33:06,822 --> 00:33:09,765
[SPEAKER_03]: We will show vehicles and racetracks, driving and racing elements.

503
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:13,068
[SPEAKER_03]: It is an action-oriented game, but with a lot of adventure elements.

504
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:17,151
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be story-driven, but you can also choose your own route to go through things.

505
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:17,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

506
00:33:19,093 --> 00:33:24,798
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it's better than Quake 4, because Quake 4 held my interest for about three seconds and I was like, eh, not interested.

507
00:33:25,098 --> 00:33:28,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well hopefully this will hold your interest for a little bit longer than that.

508
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:31,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Quake Arena is headed to Xbox Live Arcade.

509
00:33:31,624 --> 00:33:32,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is something we...

510
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:33,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking, is this like the...

511
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:03,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Old school version of Quake, but just adapted for Xbox Live.

512
00:34:03,244 --> 00:34:04,245
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be, I don't know.

513
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it have the original Nine Inch Nails soundtrack and all that?

514
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:08,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

515
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:09,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be sad.

516
00:34:11,573 --> 00:34:13,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I have fond memories of Quake.

517
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:17,516
[SPEAKER_03]: This was back in the day when broadband you could only find in colleges.

518
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:20,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Broadband was not really sold for commercial use.

519
00:34:21,117 --> 00:34:28,720
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends went to college in the Bay Area and I used to call in, dial up to their broadband connection and we would play Quake.

520
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,161
[SPEAKER_03]: About three of them in the dorms and then me on dial up.

521
00:34:31,582 --> 00:34:32,742
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd stay up all night long playing Quake.

522
00:34:32,762 --> 00:34:33,302
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

523
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:36,044
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't do that with Duke Nukem Forever for some reason.

524
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:37,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

525
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:38,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it never came out.

526
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:42,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps this is another game people will stay up all night playing, though.

527
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:42,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

528
00:34:42,806 --> 00:34:44,626
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game called Quake Zero.

529
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:50,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's probably Quake 3 Arena coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

530
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:52,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's different.

531
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:54,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Quake Zero is going to cost zero.

532
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:55,688
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's called Quake Zero.

533
00:34:55,728 --> 00:34:56,368
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free.

534
00:34:56,568 --> 00:35:02,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that, but the port of Quake 3 Arena... Oh, so the Quake Arena game... That would be awesome.

535
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Quake 3 is my favorite.

536
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go.

537
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would be great.

538
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:10,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyway, Quake Zero is going to be a web-based version of Quake 3 multiplayer.

539
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:13,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can just fire up your web browser and play.

540
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:16,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Has the source code been out for Quake 3?

541
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:16,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember.

542
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:19,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it doesn't matter because it's being developed in-house anyway, so they have it.

543
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:24,940
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're going to be putting it out there, and I guess it's going to be ad-supported.

544
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,381
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to have some in-game advertising.

545
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:27,241
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it's really going to be $0.

546
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:29,843
[SPEAKER_03]: but free is good.

547
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:35,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see Quake and I'm playing it and then there's a McDonald's ad or something.

548
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:37,607
[SPEAKER_01]: That would make it totally realistic.

549
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:41,970
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says LOL Quake Zero.

550
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero calories, zero sugar.

551
00:35:44,271 --> 00:35:46,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, you know, from all that sitting.

552
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:48,814
[SPEAKER_03]: More caffeine, exactly.

553
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:55,618
[SPEAKER_03]: NintendoManiac64 said I wonder if Quake Zero will be anything like Phosphor when it runs on Shockwave.

554
00:35:56,518 --> 00:35:59,460
[SPEAKER_03]: RossDLUT says, yeah, ID released the source code ages ago.

555
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I remember reading something about that.

556
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:10,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if only Quake Zero were compatible with the Wii web browser, which I honestly doubt it would be, but we can hope.

557
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:18,468
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that will be compatible, though, they announced Unreal Tournament 3, which is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 later this year.

558
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:21,990
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be supporting keyboard and mouse.

559
00:36:22,623 --> 00:36:24,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

560
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:32,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people really love keyboard and mouse, especially playing PC first-person shooters.

561
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:37,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you can actually do that on the console and kind of have a fair shake at people playing on PC.

562
00:36:37,973 --> 00:36:39,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Or as people playing on PC.

563
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:43,558
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool because that will put that whole debate to rest finally.

564
00:36:43,598 --> 00:36:44,439
[SPEAKER_03]: People can take it out.

565
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:47,322
[SPEAKER_03]: What is better, the controller or the keyboard and mouse?

566
00:36:47,382 --> 00:36:48,483
[SPEAKER_03]: People can finally duke it out.

567
00:36:48,503 --> 00:36:54,308
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, I mean, Unreal Tournament 3 for the PS3 is actually kind of shaping up more like a PC game.

568
00:36:54,328 --> 00:37:00,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously it is a PC game as well, but with the fact that you can download mods for it.

569
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:01,335
[SPEAKER_03]: That is pretty awesome.

570
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to hand it to PlayStation 3 for that.

571
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:04,638
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be sweet.

572
00:37:06,215 --> 00:37:06,796
[SPEAKER_03]: We will see.

573
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,387
[SPEAKER_03]: RavensDolphin in chat says, Bluetooth mouse and keyboard for the win.

574
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:19,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigerclaw said, Unreal Tournament 3 players with keyboard and mouse will pwn the UT3 players with the 6-axis.

575
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:23,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not like the keyboard and mouse are going to vibrate either.

576
00:37:24,338 --> 00:37:25,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you got that.

577
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, some other news coming out of QuakeCon.

578
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this coming out of QuakeCon or is this just about the same time?

579
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:34,802
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the same time.

580
00:37:35,202 --> 00:37:36,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be out of QuakeCon.

581
00:37:36,342 --> 00:37:37,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see here.

582
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:41,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this story is coming from Ain't It Cool News, which is kind of interesting.

583
00:37:41,624 --> 00:37:45,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Roger Avery is working on an adaptation of

584
00:37:45,882 --> 00:37:48,665
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

585
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:04,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

586
00:38:04,488 --> 00:38:04,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

587
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:06,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't he?

588
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but I know he's not doing it again.

589
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:09,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he was tied to it.

590
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:10,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, we talked about that a couple weeks ago.

591
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:12,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm talking about it now, so continue your story.

592
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:23,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see World War... According to Ain't It Cool News, they expect we'll see World War II crazy tongue-in-cheek horror sci-fi action.

593
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you'll get like Hitler in the big mech like you fought in the game.

594
00:38:27,823 --> 00:38:29,484
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be kind of strange.

595
00:38:29,504 --> 00:38:31,325
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds perfect for Uwe Boll, though.

596
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:35,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I forgot to mention that earlier.

597
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:38,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I interviewed Uwe Boll this week.

598
00:38:38,242 --> 00:38:38,903
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

599
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,064
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you not mention this?

600
00:38:40,124 --> 00:38:44,327
[SPEAKER_03]: People turned the show off ten minutes ago with all the WoW talk.

601
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:45,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot.

602
00:38:45,228 --> 00:38:46,189
[SPEAKER_03]: You met Uwe Boll?

603
00:38:46,509 --> 00:38:47,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't meet him.

604
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I interviewed him over the phone, though.

605
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:49,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

606
00:38:49,752 --> 00:38:50,492
[SPEAKER_03]: But not for this show.

607
00:38:50,612 --> 00:38:51,413
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not for this show.

608
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:52,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I interviewed him for my work.

609
00:38:53,074 --> 00:38:53,575
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

610
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:54,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what happened?

611
00:38:54,896 --> 00:38:55,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, here's the thing.

612
00:38:56,097 --> 00:39:00,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to watch his movie BloodRayne 2 Deliverance, and it's horrible.

613
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:04,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Vampire Western Vampire Western Vampire Western

614
00:39:19,855 --> 00:39:25,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, obviously the interview was tame because it was for a magazine, so we had to be positive about the whole thing.

615
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,897
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did ask him about the boxing stuff.

616
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:28,697
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of funny.

617
00:39:30,297 --> 00:39:35,639
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have the whole interview transcribed on the Orange Lounge live journal community.

618
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:38,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to check it out there, you can see everything we talked about.

619
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:40,340
[SPEAKER_02]: We also talked about there's a new...

620
00:39:42,586 --> 00:39:46,055
[SPEAKER_02]: movie he's doing called Tunnel Rats that's being made into a game at the same time.

621
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:47,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of an interesting thing.

622
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:50,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, Postal's coming out this year, so...

623
00:39:51,547 --> 00:39:55,628
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a lot of advertisement at Comic Con for Postal.

624
00:39:55,668 --> 00:39:56,228
[SPEAKER_01]: It was weird.

625
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:46,430
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I don't know But, okay, interesting is a very, like, broad word Because, like, you could know a guy that, like, picks his nose and eats it And you could go, that's really interesting I kind of felt bad for him a little bit Because he's not trying to make awesome movies He's just trying to make genre flicks And he just happens to use video games to kind of supplement that To get more of an audience I don't know

626
00:40:46,963 --> 00:40:48,944
[SPEAKER_02]: He's kind of a low, underachiever, I guess.

627
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:53,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wakes, who gets out of bed in the morning and goes, I want to make a vampire western?

628
00:40:55,528 --> 00:40:56,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Film students?

629
00:40:56,849 --> 00:40:57,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.

630
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:02,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should make Orange Lounge Radio the movie, and it should be a vampire western.

631
00:41:03,272 --> 00:41:07,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the movie itself, I knew it was bad, like, within the first two minutes.

632
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:10,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched the whole movie and fast-forwarded, because I couldn't stand it.

633
00:41:11,357 --> 00:41:16,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, though, I got to hear most of the dialogue, because it was really slow.

634
00:41:17,116 --> 00:41:18,876
[SPEAKER_02]: The only bad thing about it, there was no nudity.

635
00:41:19,357 --> 00:41:20,137
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of sucked.

636
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:27,279
[SPEAKER_02]: But, Zach Ward, the guy that plays the main character in the Postal movie, he played Billy the Kid, the vampire.

637
00:41:27,979 --> 00:41:29,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of liked him in that.

638
00:41:29,879 --> 00:41:32,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he was a good vampire.

639
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:38,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, and here's why he was a good vampire, he would hurt innocent people without a thought.

640
00:41:38,682 --> 00:41:46,044
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, for example, the very end of the movie, she's going to rescue these kids because he's going to bite them all and turn them and, you know...

641
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:48,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, make himself more immortal or something.

642
00:41:49,411 --> 00:41:55,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And she walks in and this trap springs and basically all the kids get hung.

643
00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:57,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

644
00:41:57,896 --> 00:42:02,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she's pushing this counterweight back so that the kids don't die.

645
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:04,040
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately one of the little kids dies.

646
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's stuff like that throughout the whole movie.

647
00:42:07,182 --> 00:42:09,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not afraid to hurt innocent little children in the movie.

648
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:11,064
[SPEAKER_02]: I can respect that.

649
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:11,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

650
00:42:12,305 --> 00:42:12,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

651
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

652
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:16,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Kill children, earn points for Loki.

653
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:26,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I gotta say real quick is that Robert M has the, in our chat room at chatonorangeloungeradio.com, has the first piece of casting news for Orange Lounge Radio, the new vampire western movie.

654
00:42:27,574 --> 00:42:29,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki has been cast to play Tingle.

655
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:30,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

656
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:33,218
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no Tingle in this movie.

657
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,100
[SPEAKER_02]: But where will we get our rupees?

658
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:41,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, moving on to something completely opposite of that.

659
00:42:42,634 --> 00:42:51,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Lego Indiana Jones was announced at Comic Con because there aren't enough Lego franchises yet and they're going to milk that for every penny that they can.

660
00:42:51,763 --> 00:42:53,005
[SPEAKER_03]: But Lego games aren't that bad.

661
00:42:53,545 --> 00:42:54,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I can think of worse games.

662
00:42:54,927 --> 00:42:56,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I can think of far worse games.

663
00:42:56,188 --> 00:42:56,749
[SPEAKER_02]: They aren't that bad.

664
00:42:56,849 --> 00:43:00,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So following Lego Batman this year, you're going to be seeing Lego Indiana Jones next year.

665
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:02,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want Lego Batman, by the way.

666
00:43:04,276 --> 00:43:04,997
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be pretty cool.

667
00:43:06,707 --> 00:43:11,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a pity that Jamie isn't here because she would probably be running circles around this story.

668
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy about this one.

669
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:18,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, there is a Doctor Who video game that could be on its way for Christmas.

670
00:43:19,415 --> 00:43:25,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Top Trumps has revealed they plan for a Doctor Who video game to be released in time for Christmas 2007.

671
00:43:25,098 --> 00:43:29,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It's thought to be available on the PC, PlayStation 2, DS, and mobile games.

672
00:43:30,421 --> 00:43:34,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, an advertisement for the game appears in the new Doctor Who Top Trumps card pack.

673
00:43:34,824 --> 00:43:35,625
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

674
00:43:57,066 --> 00:43:58,887
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good news and bad news.

675
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:01,289
[SPEAKER_03]: The good news is it's a Doctor Who video game.

676
00:44:01,669 --> 00:44:09,873
[SPEAKER_03]: The bad news is it's a Doctor Who video game because video games that are based off of TV shows and stuff usually don't go too well.

677
00:44:10,394 --> 00:44:16,517
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true, but remember they announced that Battlestar game for Xbox Live Arcade a while back?

678
00:44:17,258 --> 00:44:18,798
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out last week, I think.

679
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:19,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it actually come out?

680
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:21,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Battlestar.

681
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I'm thinking Wing Commander.

682
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:23,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

683
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:26,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Battlestar, I know it's on PartnerNet and my friends that work at

684
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:55,138
[SPEAKER_01]: EA have been playing it and they actually said it's a pretty fun game even though like they're hardcore fans and it really is like a typical space shooter with Battlestar just plastered on it nothing really Battlestar related beyond that so you get occasional gems and I hope to goodness that the Heroes game that Ubisoft is doing is going to be good so I mean there's no need to really worry about games that come from TV shows I think

685
00:44:57,354 --> 00:44:59,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's a little bit more encouraging there.

686
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:05,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there is another interesting rumor that's come out recently.

687
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one that has me extremely excited.

688
00:45:08,762 --> 00:45:14,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, EGM has run their rumor mill story from Quarterman.

689
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,646
[SPEAKER_02]: He does this every month.

690
00:45:16,427 --> 00:45:21,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rumor is that apparently they were, I believe, level 5.

691
00:45:23,672 --> 00:45:25,733
[SPEAKER_02]: They developed some RPGs and stuff.

692
00:45:27,006 --> 00:45:28,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, actually, no, they weren't the ones that developed this.

693
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:29,026
[SPEAKER_02]: My mistake.

694
00:45:29,387 --> 00:45:31,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, Bionic Commando.

695
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:34,608
[SPEAKER_02]: It was originally going to be made into a PlayStation Network game.

696
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:40,449
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they decided that they're just going to make it into a full-fledged game instead.

697
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:45,710
[SPEAKER_02]: So, possibly a Bionic Commando game soon.

698
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:52,391
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be all kinds of rad, because that's like an old series that a lot of people would like to see get brought back.

699
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:54,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be very happy about that.

700
00:45:54,692 --> 00:45:55,552
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as they don't, like...

701
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,002
[SPEAKER_03]: turn it into a completely different game.

702
00:45:59,983 --> 00:46:00,543
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

703
00:46:01,144 --> 00:46:03,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, try to keep some of the elements that made the first one fun.

704
00:46:03,786 --> 00:46:06,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I would not want to see Bionic Commando go 3D.

705
00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:07,810
[SPEAKER_03]: That would not be fun for me.

706
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:09,311
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I don't know.

707
00:46:12,874 --> 00:46:20,681
[SPEAKER_02]: It would probably, if they did it, like, if it was as good as the Rygar game, you know, when they updated that, I mean, that wasn't too bad, I think.

708
00:46:21,722 --> 00:46:21,942
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

709
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom, chat.orangelandre.com says, Dear Capcom, Wii version.

710
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:28,228
[SPEAKER_03]: K, thanks.

711
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,031
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be interesting.

712
00:46:31,877 --> 00:46:32,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, we'll see.

713
00:46:54,251 --> 00:46:59,214
[SPEAKER_03]: NASCAR 06, FIFA World Cup 06, all those are shutting down.

714
00:46:59,414 --> 00:47:03,796
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the thought is that most of you will have upgraded to 08 by that point, if not at least 07.

715
00:47:04,577 --> 00:47:06,938
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't upgraded from Madden 06.

716
00:47:07,538 --> 00:47:08,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you own Madden 06?

717
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:11,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you mean you haven't upgraded from Madden 99?

718
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,261
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so not your kind of game, I thought.

719
00:47:13,521 --> 00:47:13,802
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.

720
00:47:13,822 --> 00:47:14,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it achievement points?

721
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:15,783
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

722
00:47:15,803 --> 00:47:16,363
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a whore.

723
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:17,884
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a whore for achievement points.

724
00:47:18,764 --> 00:47:20,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other games that are getting shut down, though.

725
00:47:20,286 --> 00:47:20,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it for free.

726
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:25,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprisingly, November 1st of 07, Burnout Revenge on Xbox and PlayStation 2.

727
00:47:26,431 --> 00:47:33,678
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're shutting off one of the Burnout titles, and the Need for Speed Underground and Most Wanted also getting the plug pulled on them, November 1st of 07.

728
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:44,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Underground's damn old, and Revenge, technically, on... Well, the Xbox is the latest one, but PlayStation, I mean, they had Dominator, so...

729
00:47:45,518 --> 00:47:45,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

730
00:47:46,259 --> 00:47:54,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you're one of the five people that plays these games online still, then you're probably pretty angsty, so we dedicate the FUs of the Week just for you.

731
00:47:54,966 --> 00:48:02,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, usually we would have music here, but since we're in our temper, thank you.

732
00:48:02,192 --> 00:48:04,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that's the music.

733
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:05,194
[SPEAKER_03]: We can find music.

734
00:48:05,355 --> 00:48:06,836
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too late now, we're live, remember?

735
00:48:07,356 --> 00:48:11,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so there we go, there's your music, and it's the FUs of the Week time, so Loki, start us off tonight.

736
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:37,991
[SPEAKER_02]: my FU of the week goes to Genki for just porting the Playstation 2 version of Wengen Midnight to the Playstation 3 I mean, come on, spend a little bit more time hell, that fucking lame-ass game Import Tuner Challenge that came out on the Xbox 360 looked better than this that's sad and maybe some better music in it too because that's kind of sad too

737
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:41,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, music like that!

738
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,941
[SPEAKER_03]: My next FU goes to Shane for not shutting his cell phone off during the recording of the show.

739
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:48,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you're talking about.

740
00:48:48,222 --> 00:48:58,725
[SPEAKER_03]: My other FU goes to Comcast for making me suffer without internet until Tuesday, and also to whichever mystery neighbor I'm stealing Wi-Fi from for not being strong enough.

741
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:07,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I will give it this, like yesterday, the strength of the Wi-Fi was perfect, and I was able to download Torrents of Big Brother to get all caught up on Big Brother 8.

742
00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:07,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

743
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:12,159
[SPEAKER_03]: and Jen Sucks, just for the record.

744
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane, do you have any FUs of the Wii?

745
00:49:16,302 --> 00:49:17,743
[SPEAKER_01]: I could come up with one real quick.

746
00:49:18,063 --> 00:49:30,852
[SPEAKER_01]: FU to Blizzard for not giving me the expansion for free or telling me when it's going to come out because I really want it and it's really all I've been reading about since they announced it.

747
00:49:31,212 --> 00:49:35,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and the internet, that's all we do is just talk about the WoW expansion.

748
00:49:37,537 --> 00:49:37,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

749
00:49:38,657 --> 00:49:39,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back into some news.

750
00:49:40,396 --> 00:49:45,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, another cool game that's going to be heading our way pretty soon.

751
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:50,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Crysis has been announced to be released on November 16th.

752
00:49:50,722 --> 00:49:52,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And that game looks damn good.

753
00:49:53,204 --> 00:49:54,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really want to build a PC for it.

754
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:56,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a little more about this game.

755
00:49:57,006 --> 00:49:57,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know much about it.

756
00:49:58,047 --> 00:50:01,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Crysis is the next game in the series of, I guess, Far Cry.

757
00:50:02,029 --> 00:50:03,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though there is Far Cry 2.

758
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:03,890
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, I've heard of this.

759
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:08,293
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just... I mean, the original Far Cry game was pretty good looking.

760
00:50:08,793 --> 00:50:09,974
[SPEAKER_02]: This one now is just...

761
00:50:10,816 --> 00:50:11,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

762
00:50:32,685 --> 00:50:36,967
[SPEAKER_01]: BoxArt right there looks like it's crazy, like 2,000 years in the future.

763
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:38,648
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the future, I'm assuming.

764
00:50:39,189 --> 00:50:43,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it's still on a tropical island type thing.

765
00:50:43,351 --> 00:50:55,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Aliens have either crash-landed in one section of the map, and so you have this whole section that's kind of zero-G and frozen, so it's interesting stuff there.

766
00:50:55,978 --> 00:50:59,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, the whole suit that you have is like a nano-suit that you can upgrade to,

767
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:06,985
[SPEAKER_02]: You can switch it to speed, so all your powers and your speed, and you can move around really fast, or armor, or stealth, and stuff like that.

768
00:51:07,926 --> 00:51:08,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool looking.

769
00:51:08,826 --> 00:51:09,787
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be interesting.

770
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:17,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is also interesting, and that is SingStar is continuing to do a lot of business and coming out with new games.

771
00:51:17,472 --> 00:51:18,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess this is mostly in Europe, though.

772
00:51:18,973 --> 00:51:21,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not heard of SingStar really taking off in this country.

773
00:51:21,174 --> 00:51:22,675
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one coming out this month, actually.

774
00:51:22,695 --> 00:51:23,376
[SPEAKER_02]: My gosh.

775
00:51:23,436 --> 00:51:25,537
[SPEAKER_02]: SingStar amped in the U.S.

776
00:51:25,797 --> 00:51:27,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they are doing really well there.

777
00:51:27,878 --> 00:51:30,759
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is coming out in the U.S.

778
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:31,400
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.

779
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,001
[SPEAKER_03]: This is SingStar Anthems.

780
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:37,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually, I gotta hand it to them.

781
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:39,304
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually a pretty kick-ass song list.

782
00:51:39,364 --> 00:51:44,026
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like your power ballads and your anthems, this is a pretty kick-ass song list.

783
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:46,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Anastasia, Left Outside Alone.

784
00:51:47,047 --> 00:51:47,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually like that song.

785
00:51:48,028 --> 00:51:48,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably no one else has heard of it.

786
00:51:49,068 --> 00:51:50,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Avril Lavigne, I'm With You.

787
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:52,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Cyndi Lauper, Time After Time.

788
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,851
[SPEAKER_03]: You DDR fans, the original version of Ordinary World by Duran Duran is in this.

789
00:51:57,271 --> 00:51:58,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Alone by Heart.

790
00:51:58,651 --> 00:51:59,792
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a hell of a power ballad.

791
00:52:00,172 --> 00:52:01,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Two songs by Mr. Mister.

792
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,152
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

793
00:52:03,432 --> 00:52:04,253
[SPEAKER_03]: You get broken wings.

794
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:07,133
[SPEAKER_03]: And Queen, the show must go on.

795
00:52:07,213 --> 00:52:09,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock Set, a couple Rock Set songs in there.

796
00:52:09,234 --> 00:52:09,874
[SPEAKER_01]: What are Rock Set songs?

797
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:11,114
[SPEAKER_01]: It must have been Love, of course.

798
00:52:11,134 --> 00:52:12,335
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's the other one?

799
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:12,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to Your Heart.

800
00:52:13,515 --> 00:52:13,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

801
00:52:13,995 --> 00:52:15,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted Joyride.

802
00:52:15,655 --> 00:52:16,135
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

803
00:52:16,155 --> 00:52:16,956
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a power ballad.

804
00:52:17,136 --> 00:52:18,116
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the ultimate.

805
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:20,937
[SPEAKER_03]: The ultimate power ballad, Meatloaf.

806
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:23,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd do anything for love, but I wouldn't do that.

807
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:24,799
[SPEAKER_03]: That is all kinds of awesome.

808
00:52:24,819 --> 00:52:30,582
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do agree with what Joystick said when they reported on this, and that would be, this game is shit without journey.

809
00:52:30,963 --> 00:52:33,144
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you have a ballads game and have no journey?

810
00:52:34,045 --> 00:52:35,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my Don't Stop Believin'?

811
00:52:35,306 --> 00:52:36,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that on the Sony label?

812
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it on the Sony label?

813
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:40,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's all they get are songs from the label.

814
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:40,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not, then.

815
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised Open Arms isn't on there.

816
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:42,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I know!

817
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:47,393
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you pay whatever it takes to get Open Arms in this game?

818
00:52:47,813 --> 00:52:48,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Don't Stop Believin'?

819
00:52:48,974 --> 00:52:51,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony can't afford to buy things right now.

820
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:53,396
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all poor with the PS3 stuff.

821
00:52:53,416 --> 00:52:53,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, whatever.

822
00:52:54,857 --> 00:52:57,779
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they want this game to take off, they will invest the money in it.

823
00:52:57,859 --> 00:52:59,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious to see what Chad says about this.

824
00:53:00,781 --> 00:53:00,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

825
00:53:02,754 --> 00:53:05,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, they're still commenting on Crysis.

826
00:53:05,797 --> 00:53:10,502
[SPEAKER_03]: RossDLUT says, ooh, Crysis, a generic first-person shooter game with an extra graphical effort.

827
00:53:12,003 --> 00:53:13,285
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that generic.

828
00:53:13,345 --> 00:53:14,486
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty awesome.

829
00:53:15,247 --> 00:53:15,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

830
00:53:16,388 --> 00:53:18,590
[SPEAKER_03]: SonOfDad says, karaoke in the U.S.

831
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,951
[SPEAKER_03]: only belongs in bars.

832
00:53:20,987 --> 00:53:22,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but what if you have a bar at home?

833
00:53:22,368 --> 00:53:23,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you have a bunch of liquor at home.

834
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,029
[SPEAKER_03]: That's acceptable, right?

835
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:29,971
[SPEAKER_01]: That's false, because a lot of people I know love playing the karaoke games at parties and stuff.

836
00:53:30,011 --> 00:53:30,851
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fun to do.

837
00:53:31,272 --> 00:53:33,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert M. suggests Foreigner, Poison.

838
00:53:34,513 --> 00:53:36,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Son of Dad also says he wants the final countdown.

839
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:38,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

840
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:41,713
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be awesome.

841
00:53:42,033 --> 00:53:46,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got 2DX4thStyle finally, and I love that song so much.

842
00:53:46,454 --> 00:53:48,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that part of the Konami liquidation?

843
00:53:48,355 --> 00:53:48,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

844
00:53:48,675 --> 00:53:48,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Sale?

845
00:53:49,796 --> 00:53:51,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand new 2DX4thStyle.

846
00:53:51,636 --> 00:53:53,457
[SPEAKER_01]: The five-finger sale at Konami.

847
00:53:53,637 --> 00:53:55,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, it was free.

848
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,091
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I found something the other day, actually.

849
00:53:59,151 --> 00:53:59,471
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

850
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it today.

851
00:54:01,152 --> 00:54:04,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a DDR Club append.

852
00:54:04,933 --> 00:54:06,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know where the hell that came from.

853
00:54:06,434 --> 00:54:07,194
[SPEAKER_03]: How random.

854
00:54:07,734 --> 00:54:08,574
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be mine.

855
00:54:08,715 --> 00:54:10,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have both those games.

856
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:10,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

857
00:54:10,855 --> 00:54:13,536
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably have it from when we used to live together years ago.

858
00:54:13,636 --> 00:54:14,937
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think Jamie gave it to me.

859
00:54:15,891 --> 00:54:17,091
[SPEAKER_03]: She gave you a Club of Pen?

860
00:54:17,131 --> 00:54:18,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those things are actually worth kind of money.

861
00:54:18,932 --> 00:54:19,572
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I doubt it.

862
00:54:19,712 --> 00:54:22,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the DDR games nobody fucking played.

863
00:54:22,413 --> 00:54:23,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Who played Club of Pen?

864
00:54:23,273 --> 00:54:23,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

865
00:54:23,413 --> 00:54:28,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't play it anyways because I don't have second mix, so it's completely useless to me.

866
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:30,455
[SPEAKER_02]: It did have a lot of crap on it, though.

867
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:33,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about release dates, shall we?

868
00:54:33,195 --> 00:54:35,976
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll travel to Europe first, even though Jamie's not here tonight.

869
00:54:35,996 --> 00:54:38,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got her back, and it's really not a long list this week.

870
00:54:39,617 --> 00:54:43,898
[SPEAKER_03]: On August 10th, over in Europe, you guys are getting Pac-Man Rally on the PSP.

871
00:54:44,818 --> 00:54:45,879
[SPEAKER_03]: The Game Named After Loki

872
00:55:05,578 --> 00:55:08,759
[SPEAKER_01]: You're ruining all the future release date list.

873
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie's going to be so angry.

874
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:18,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel bad because there's only one freaking release this week, so I'm trying to give them something to look forward to because I don't think Europe is filled with Pac-Man Rally fans.

875
00:55:18,202 --> 00:55:21,563
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was, this is a huge release for them.

876
00:55:21,643 --> 00:55:28,905
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm wrong, Europe folks, please send us an email, mailbag at orangeonline3.com and please tell us how much you love Pac-Man Rally and how you're going to be camping outside.

877
00:55:29,185 --> 00:55:31,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us your pictures from camping outside game.

878
00:55:31,426 --> 00:55:32,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go camping.

879
00:55:32,486 --> 00:55:34,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you want to hear something?

880
00:55:34,787 --> 00:55:38,129
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to hear something about the stupid rally games that they have in Europe?

881
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:42,152
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep getting fucking some, was it SVG or something?

882
00:55:42,332 --> 00:55:48,575
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these smaller distributors out there keeps publishing this European crap that comes over here.

883
00:55:48,615 --> 00:55:51,837
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, they have Crazy Frog Racer.

884
00:55:52,117 --> 00:55:55,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, ooh, we really need a game based off that annoying piece of shit.

885
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's this Kokoto Racer thing, which is like some little devil looking thing.

886
00:56:01,164 --> 00:56:01,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

887
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:03,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many kart racing games in Europe.

888
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:12,233
[SPEAKER_02]: However, though, in the U.S., there's not a whole lot coming out this week, but there is a lot more than in the U.K.

889
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:18,238
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, on PSP, we've got Crazy Taxi Fair Wars, also Tomb Raider Anniversary.

890
00:56:18,338 --> 00:56:19,179
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be coming out.

891
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:27,425
[SPEAKER_02]: On the DS, you've got Mega Man, Star Force Pegasus, and Star Force Leo.

892
00:56:27,966 --> 00:56:30,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're buying through GameStop, Star Force Dragon.

893
00:56:33,092 --> 00:56:39,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we've got Glory Days 2, which is supposed to be a pretty good kind of a side-scroller strategy game.

894
00:56:40,674 --> 00:56:43,695
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Wii, Boogie is going to be coming out.

895
00:56:43,795 --> 00:56:48,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a singing and karaoke game, or dancing and karaoke game.

896
00:56:49,916 --> 00:56:57,037
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3, nothing, although I do believe that Splinter Cell Double Agent I thought was coming out this week.

897
00:56:57,757 --> 00:56:58,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

898
00:56:58,678 --> 00:56:59,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

899
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:02,781
[SPEAKER_02]: on PC.

900
00:57:04,502 --> 00:57:06,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, no Tycoon game this week.

901
00:57:07,584 --> 00:57:08,244
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a first.

902
00:57:08,484 --> 00:57:08,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.

903
00:57:08,924 --> 00:57:13,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was really hoping... Pac-Man Rally Tycoon is coming out on the PC.

904
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:13,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure.

905
00:57:13,646 --> 00:57:16,648
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's Attack on Pearl Harbor, so that's kind of cool.

906
00:57:17,748 --> 00:57:18,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh...

907
00:57:19,629 --> 00:57:19,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

908
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:21,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Start of Ender 3.

909
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:22,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo.

910
00:57:23,851 --> 00:57:25,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, coming out in Japan.

911
00:57:25,392 --> 00:57:30,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan's also kind of having a bit of a slow week when it comes to game releases, but they do have one big one that a lot of folks are looking forward to.

912
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:35,896
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PlayStation 2, Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System is coming out this week.

913
00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:37,657
[SPEAKER_03]: The dumbest name for a game.

914
00:57:38,057 --> 00:57:40,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically the International Zodiac Job System.

915
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:41,719
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the international version.

916
00:57:41,919 --> 00:57:45,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the international version that doesn't go anywhere but Japan.

917
00:57:47,362 --> 00:57:49,023
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get released anywhere else.

918
00:57:49,283 --> 00:57:51,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but there'll be people importing it.

919
00:57:52,165 --> 00:57:53,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's just the voiceovers.

920
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:55,228
[SPEAKER_01]: You can select English options.

921
00:57:55,268 --> 00:57:56,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the text is English.

922
00:57:56,529 --> 00:57:59,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, because that'd be awesome if it was in English because then you can import it.

923
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:03,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, most of the other international versions is what people did.

924
00:58:04,155 --> 00:58:08,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix, just for chains of memories on PS2.

925
00:58:08,398 --> 00:58:09,919
[SPEAKER_01]: But the text wasn't English, I thought.

926
00:58:09,939 --> 00:58:10,980
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was just the voices.

927
00:58:11,881 --> 00:58:17,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure, to be honest, because I already have Final Fantasy XII and I could care less about new systems.

928
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:20,128
[SPEAKER_01]: But you get to do new international Zodiac jobs.

929
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:20,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Yippee.

930
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:22,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever that means.

931
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:28,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it meant that you're supposed to cater your characters to more like one classic class.

932
00:58:28,094 --> 00:58:31,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Like one of them is more like a red mage and the other one is more like a black mage.

933
00:58:31,417 --> 00:58:33,179
[SPEAKER_01]: They had new classes too or something.

934
00:58:33,379 --> 00:58:35,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny languages because it wasn't English.

935
00:58:36,621 --> 00:58:40,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming out, which we should note, on the DS, the DS has a little bit more releases.

936
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:42,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there's another Yu-Gi-Oh!

937
00:58:42,446 --> 00:58:43,586
[SPEAKER_03]: game coming out, Yu-Gi-Oh!

938
00:58:43,606 --> 00:58:45,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Dual Monsters GX.

939
00:58:45,548 --> 00:58:56,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And also coming out, we should say, on Nintendo's DS from Nintendo, Donkey Kong Jungle Climber, or the King of Swing, is coming out in Japan as well.

940
00:58:56,856 --> 00:58:59,398
[SPEAKER_02]: King of Swing 2, basically.

941
00:58:59,798 --> 00:59:00,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And looking at SP...

942
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:06,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, there's a professional Atlas travel guide.

943
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:09,607
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the most fun game ever.

944
00:59:09,888 --> 00:59:11,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to look up where Rome is at.

945
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:14,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild Arms XF or Wild Arms Crossfire.

946
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,194
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also look forward to that.

947
00:59:15,474 --> 00:59:16,956
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as cool as Dust Cap 2.

948
00:59:17,557 --> 00:59:17,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

949
00:59:18,077 --> 00:59:19,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as cool as Dust Cap 2.

950
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:20,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

951
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:20,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's it.

952
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,963
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the release dates I'm going to care to name this week.

953
00:59:23,757 --> 00:59:35,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one upcoming release that we're going to get some more information about at Tokyo Game Show this year is Metal Gear Solid 4, where it's rumored that the game will actually have a release date announced.

954
00:59:37,023 --> 00:59:39,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, we're probably guessing March right now.

955
00:59:40,565 --> 00:59:45,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we just had a story about naming a date where they're going to name a release date.

956
00:59:46,407 --> 00:59:46,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it!

957
00:59:46,947 --> 00:59:47,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it again!

958
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:53,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we said no more of these stories about naming a date where they're going to have a date.

959
00:59:53,922 --> 00:59:54,922
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so stupid.

960
00:59:55,543 --> 00:59:55,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

961
00:59:56,003 --> 00:59:57,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do people get excited about this?

962
00:59:57,504 --> 00:59:58,084
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's okay.

963
00:59:58,504 --> 00:59:58,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Fired!

964
01:00:00,386 --> 01:00:01,406
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we can't fire Loki.

965
01:00:01,886 --> 01:00:03,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Or else where else would we record this week?

966
01:00:03,848 --> 01:00:04,768
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd be screwed.

967
01:00:04,908 --> 01:00:05,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

968
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:06,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

969
01:00:07,088 --> 01:00:09,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other things to note really quickly.

970
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:11,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Some releases coming out in Europe.

971
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:16,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Paper Mario is finally coming out in Europe on September 14th, speaking of dates.

972
01:00:17,397 --> 01:00:18,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you believe it?

973
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out for £35 in Europe.

974
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:20,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh...

975
01:00:25,529 --> 01:00:26,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Pac-Man Rally Pac-Man Rally

976
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:45,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for Paper Mario.

977
01:00:46,496 --> 01:00:46,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

978
01:00:46,896 --> 01:00:49,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I guess you can get 35 pounds that way.

979
01:00:49,221 --> 01:00:55,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what is much more important that is on the Nintendo DS on September 14th over in Europe is...

980
01:00:57,044 --> 01:01:01,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Freshly picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland is finally coming out.

981
01:01:01,486 --> 01:01:02,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, will you be importing it?

982
01:01:02,787 --> 01:01:14,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the great news is the DS is region free, even though there's no plans to release this game in the US yet, you can actually import this game still for probably about, I think I saw it listed somewhere for about 45 bucks if you want to get Tingle.

983
01:01:14,773 --> 01:01:15,673
[SPEAKER_03]: A waste of $45?

984
01:01:16,233 --> 01:01:16,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

985
01:01:16,674 --> 01:01:17,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Why won't you buy this game, Matt?

986
01:01:17,894 --> 01:01:18,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the hate for Tingle?

987
01:01:19,015 --> 01:01:20,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't like Tingle.

988
01:01:20,315 --> 01:01:21,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Tingle's a stupid character.

989
01:01:22,316 --> 01:01:23,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like him in Wind Waker.

990
01:01:24,417 --> 01:01:25,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hell would I like him...

991
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:29,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that he has his own game.

992
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:30,833
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if the game is any good.

993
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,054
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard anything about it.

994
01:01:32,074 --> 01:01:34,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he's going to be in fucking Smash Bros.

995
01:01:34,396 --> 01:01:34,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl.

996
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:36,578
[SPEAKER_01]: As a playable character?

997
01:01:37,018 --> 01:01:38,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never hear the fucking end of it.

998
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Tingle's in fucking Smash Bros.

999
01:01:42,682 --> 01:01:43,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.

1000
01:01:43,323 --> 01:01:44,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he'll be in it.

1001
01:01:44,864 --> 01:01:46,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he'll be in it.

1002
01:01:46,445 --> 01:01:48,447
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because I did his voice once.

1003
01:01:50,068 --> 01:01:52,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And ever since then, it's just never ending.

1004
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:53,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Never ending.

1005
01:01:54,264 --> 01:02:23,833
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be really weird to have him in it though because they're using all the Zelda things oh, do Tingle's voice, that'd be awesome they're using the Zelda things from Twilight Princess and even though I didn't beat the game I never saw Tingle there, so yeah, but he was in Wind Waker and I think he was in one of the Nintendo 64 ones he was in that crappy one, Majora's Mask but they've already covered Wind Waker and all that stuff, I thought but if they're giving him his own game they also fucking took Balloon Fight and made his own version of that, come on

1006
01:02:26,129 --> 01:02:27,871
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quirky and weird in Japanese.

1007
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate the Japanese.

1008
01:02:29,973 --> 01:02:33,676
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 is in chat and says, Tingle as the Super Smash Bros.

1009
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:35,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Brawl character, will Loki get shot?

1010
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:40,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderdog Harold has a suggestion.

1011
01:02:40,983 --> 01:02:45,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki should just say he likes Tingle and then no one would bring up Tingle ever again.

1012
01:02:46,488 --> 01:02:48,329
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Tingle though, that's the thing.

1013
01:02:49,731 --> 01:02:50,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1014
01:02:50,396 --> 01:02:52,998
[SPEAKER_03]: And Shane is going to read tonight's mailbag.

1015
01:03:18,499 --> 01:03:19,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally!

1016
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:21,103
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be interesting to say the least.

1017
01:03:21,123 --> 01:03:23,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch out, because I might make fun of you.

1018
01:03:23,307 --> 01:03:27,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we'll be back in just a moment with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
