00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet. Welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And yes, our show is a little bit broken tonight. I mean we were off for a week due to a studio move.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Meaning that the studio we used to record in is no more. It's gone.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And we're actually in a temporary location tonight. We call it Studio Loki.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And it's brought to us by the one and only Tech Master Loki who is also here on the program tonight.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes it is.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How are you doing Loki?

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm doing okay and I'm still trying to untangle this microphone cord, but that's okay.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's right. So if you notice some things are a little bit different tonight, like our opening was not its usual self.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And you know some other things, the sound might be a little bit different than what you're used to.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is why, because we're in our temporary home. I'll get more into that in just a moment.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But I also want to introduce our other guests tonight. Say hello to Miklotov.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Wouldn't I be the first guest tonight? Because you said the other guest and you just introduced Loki.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
One of our other guests. I'm sorry. I'm totally out of it tonight.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Obviously. Hello.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
All right. And also say hello. Gosh, you're mean tonight. And say hello to another guest.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Extifer.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But it's fitting though, right? I mean, Shane's always mean.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm always mean.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All right. And I'm sure you guys are probably asking what happened to Dark Zagrow? Where is she?

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh my God. What happened to her? Oh my God.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Actually, she's had some family issues this week. She had a death in the family, unfortunately.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So she's tending to those issues tonight. So obviously our thoughts are with her.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So yet another reason why our show is in chaos tonight is that, you know, Jamie had to pull out at the last second, which we can obviously understand.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But she should be back next week with us here at Orange Lawn Radio.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But I know the listeners and ourselves. We're all thinking her and her family this week.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Meanwhile, let's talk about what's going on with the show is that basically we moved.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And of course, the show taped out of the spare bedroom at the apartment I used to share with Extifer.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, we've moved on and Extifer's moved and I've moved into a new house.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And the cool thing is, is that we're going to tape out of the garage now. So it's going to be like this huge studio.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But here's the problem. We tried to call Comcast to get an appointment like a week before we moved.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Like just after we taped the last show and they said they would not come out until like August 7th.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So we were screwed with no internet. It has been hell trying to have internet at the house for this week.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There's been like nothing. Stolen Wi-Fi. That's it. And we couldn't broadcast a show off of stolen Wi-Fi.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So we had to move to a temporary home this week. So that's why we're at Studio Loki tonight.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And things are a little crazy.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But that's OK. We didn't want to go two weeks of not having a show.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I mean, because we seriously considered it because of everything going on with Jamie and going on at the other studio.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But we just didn't want to have to go two weeks with no show because that can sometimes be suicide for listeners and everything.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We really appreciate those of you guys sticking with us.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Of course, we are in chat. We have everything up. We should hopefully still have Skype line tonight.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to join us in the chat room.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And of course, lots of gaming news tonight.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Loki's got something really big he wants to talk about in Part B. It's going to be really cool.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So we'll talk about that a little later.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And all right. Let's get into how was your gaming week.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So we'll start off. How was your gaming week, Loki?

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Extremely busy. That's basically how I can describe it.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I played so much crap over the last few days, or actually the last couple of weeks, that it's just ridiculous.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, let's start off with the PSP stuff.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I went back and played through a little bit more of WTF.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And that game is weird. The more games I unlock, the weirder the game gets.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And it's awesome, though. I recommend checking it out. It's probably dirt cheap by now.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Another game I played actually just came out in the UK called State Shift.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's kind of a futuristic racing game.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I guess a little bit like Wipeout, but it's with cars or these futuristic vehicles.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Didn't care for it too much. The cars drive like giant bricks with rockets on them.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And it was impossible to make corners and stuff.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So not a game I would pick up, but then again, I'm not in the UK, so it doesn't matter.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Final Fantasy, I finished it finally, and I'm so glad I'm finished with it,

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
because those new dungeons that they added on with the PlayStation 1 release, it's just crap.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's just like, oh, we need some dungeons, quick, let's make some.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I mean, and they have no continuity whatsoever, just crap.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And I was so pissed off at the game, so that's done.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Final Fantasy II, I played it for about five minutes, turned it off, because I didn't want to play it anymore.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The battle system is just not good.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What? I love Final Fantasy II. I played it on the Game Boy Advance a lot. You don't like it?

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't like it.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But you know, for me though, I think Final Fantasy XI takes a lot from Final Fantasy II,

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
like in regards to the whole job systems and stuff, the way you kind of level your characters.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Maybe I'll try it again, but yeah.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I love Final Fantasy II. I think it's more fun than Final Fantasy I.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't wait to play the PSP port.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Wait, so you have Final Fantasy II on PSP, and you're not playing it?

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think you should let me have it for a little while.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Might be fun. I have no internet at home. Take pity on me.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Maybe.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Alright.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Anyways, so beyond the PSP, on the 360, I played quite a few things, including some demos.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I tried the demo for Beautiful Katamari, which a lot of people don't know is actually out there.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's not on live, but if you happen to subscribe to the official Xbox magazine,

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
there is a demo disc for Beautiful Katamari in the September issue.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It is extremely short. It's only three minutes long, but goddamn do I want that game.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's beautiful.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
How beautiful Katamari.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The other thing, let's see, I played Darkness.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That one looks okay. It looks like a pretty good game.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The demo kind of sucked, though.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't know. Not what I'm going to buy, but I'd probably rent it.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I did buy Overlord, and that game I played the demo of, and I thought,

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
oh, I'm probably going to get pretty bored of this really quick.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Actually, I'm pretty surprised.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I've been playing it quite a bit, and at first you're like,

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
well, maybe it should be slightly good because then the townsfolk will help you out with stuff.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Then eventually they start pissing you off, and I think that they programmed that game that way on purpose.

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So I just go through the towns and basically kill everybody, and I can do that over and over.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I've got my wenches, and it's awesome.

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And then, let's see, I also, on the PlayStation 3, I got my import copy of Wengen Midnight.

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And that's pretty cool.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The game itself, though, graphically looks like a PlayStation 2 game.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's probably the only disappointing thing about it.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Otherwise, I guess it's exactly like the arcade game.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Do you think they were originally building it for PlayStation 2 and just decided to...

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It came out for PlayStation 2 last year, but it's not...

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I mean, the graphics, if you were to put it up against Knee for Speed or Juiced or something like that,

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
it would horribly fail.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's just, I don't know.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It kind of went a little lazy there, but otherwise, it's an okay game.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Worth checking out a little bit more.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Unfortunately, the whole story mode in the game is all Japanese, so I don't really understand any of it.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But I figure it's just racing, so it can't be that hard.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
God, I know there was some other stuff I played, but I can't remember.

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Those are basically the main things.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
All right, moving on.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
MyGamingWeek, and I'm looking at chatroom at chat.orangelandrater.com.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Jvmon says, Skye must be dying without World of Warcraft.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You know, I wasn't until I heard all the news from BlizzCon this week, which we'll get into in a little bit.

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Nexfer is going to give us a report because he was there at BlizzCon.

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And then when I heard all of that, I was like, I have to give my character to 70.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But before BlizzCon happened, I was doing okay with no World of Warcraft, because I was busy moving.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Like, you know, when you have all this stuff, you've got to get out of another place.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And believe me, I have a lot of crap, okay? I have a lot of crap.

129
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So moving that kind of kept me busy and kept my mind off, wow.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But when I did finally get everything settled in and I had no internet, that didn't leave a whole lot to play.

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So I went back to old PlayStation 2 games that I never really finished,

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and the first one that came to mind was Kingdom Hearts 2,

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
because I played that game quite a ways in before the first time I played it, and then just kind of stopped.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So I'm just restarting that, and I pretty much caught up to where I was.

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And, you know, Kingdom Hearts 2, yeah, I guess its biggest downfall is that the battle system is kind of a bit of button mashing,

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and it's nothing that intuitive.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But I'll be damned if you don't just kind of immerse yourself in the world,

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and the way they tie things together is so great.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And the voice acting is pretty darn good, except for Aerith, I hate her.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And everything else, the music and the graphics and the full motions, it's a great game.

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
One of my favorite PlayStation 2 games.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I remember the other game I played, Heavenly Sword on PlayStation 3, I played the demo for that.

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh, the demo, how was that?

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It was very short, again, but it kind of reminds me a little bit of God of War,

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
but it's a whole lot of button mashing, it seems like, because it's basically two buttons that you do certain moves with,

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and you can switch your weapon up a little bit.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But, I don't know, I'm probably going to pick it up, just because there's not a whole lot coming out for the PlayStation 3,

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
so, you know, it's worth my money.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Interesting comment, Dark Tetsuya says, Kingdom Hearts 3 should use something along the lines of Final Fantasy 12.

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Final Fantasy 12 did have a pretty awesome battle system, but I don't know if it would work in the Kingdom Hearts universe.

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But a lot of people think that Kingdom Hearts 3 is going to be different, because I believe the creator has said,

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Kingdom Hearts 3 is not Kingdom Hearts 3, it's something else in the Kingdom Hearts universe.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So, we'll see, it's still a ways out before they announce anything.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Raven's Dolphin in chat says, Sky got so much stuff, moving a lot of gay porn books takes a lot of space.

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You would know, Raven's Dolphin, you would.

156
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Mikotov, how was your gaming week? What kind of games did you play this week?

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Well, I'll start with Sunday, I was at Comic Con, so...

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I was going to ask you to give us the Comic Con reports, since you weren't here last week. How was that?

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Boring. I don't like comics.

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why did you go to Comic Con?

161
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I went for Heroes and Battlestar, and I was happy with both of those.

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But I got to play Silent Hill Origins, and I haven't played that since it was the behind the shoulder camera.

163
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And it's actually looking really good, and it was really fun.

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It wasn't really scary, because it's in a bright room with a lot of people, and you're playing it on a PSP.

165
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But whatever, it was still cool.

166
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Other than that, I played World of Warcraft.

167
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And I played Loki's demo of Beautiful Katamari, and that's really it.

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Did you enjoy Beautiful Katamari?

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yes, it was a really fun three minutes.

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Best three minutes you ever spent?

171
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No, but it was a fun three minutes.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What would be the best three minutes you ever spent?

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Next question.

174
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh my, alright. Game-wise, game-wise.

175
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Next question.

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Fine. Jerk. Alright, so that's it for your gaming week?

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I think so, I didn't really do much.

178
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I never do much with WoW.

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You've all been pretty boring between, you know, moving and all this other stuff.

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hiding my office clothes.

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You've been moving out of your office.

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah.

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Is everything okay? You doing alright?

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah.

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Was there any last hurrah? Did everybody go out for drinks one last time or anything?

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, actually. Nobody went out for drinks. It was weird.

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Alright.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We normally drink for no reason. This was a reason and nobody drank.

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I hope I'm okay to say this on the show, though, but as I understand,

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
there's little bits and pieces that you collected for listeners in the future.

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, and I'll give those to you to give away.

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So, more information at a later date on you can own a piece of what once was Konami.

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Aw, it's so sad.

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
How sad.

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Alright.

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Why are we laughing?

197
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's the seven legged lamb I'm looking at. Look how adorable.

199
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's actually really, it really is sad because I know we had a lot of friends that worked there like yourself, so it sucks.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, it's just me.

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It'd be better if it was a chicken because, you know.

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
They had to kill it because it couldn't be.

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What in the hell are you guys looking at?

204
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is the worst.

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Seven legged lamb.

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is the worst radio ever. You're showing pictures of a seven legged lamb in studio.

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Because it can't poop.

208
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Alright.

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What?

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
They had to kill it because it couldn't poop.

211
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Seven legs and no ass.

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And it was a hermaphrodite.

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Why are you reading Perez Hilton during this show?

214
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know.

215
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That has nothing to do with gaming.

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Last time I saw a zombie reindeer, one that had frozen and rotted away and it looked like a zombie reindeer.

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Wow.

218
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Next.

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Oh my gosh, this is the worst radio.

220
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes, Dark Tetsuya summed it up in chat.

221
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Worst radio ever.

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Thank you very much.

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Whenever you're the worst radio ever.

224
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This will be the last show from Studio Loki because this is what happens to the show.

225
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Alright, anyhow.

226
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Housekeeping real quick.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We weren't here last week so we weren't able to tell you guys that we got nominated in the podcast awards at podcastawards.com.

228
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So thank you guys very much for helping us to get the nominations.

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And the voting is now open.

230
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So if you head on over to www.podcastawards.com, you can vote for Orange Lawn Radio.

231
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We're nominated for best gaming podcast.

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And it's really cool because like lots of independent podcasts are nominated.

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
They upped it from 5 to 10 this year and there's like lots of independent podcasts nominated.

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Like a lot of good shows, including our good buddies at All Games.

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah.

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And they are whoring now that they're trying to get people to vote every day.

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes, you can vote every day and I know that even though they've kind of made it seem like that there is some sort of prevention against automated voting and stuff.

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You can vote once per day, once per e-mail.

239
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So just make sure that you're checking your e-mail to hit those confirmation e-mails.

240
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Just do it legitimately.

241
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Don't cheat.

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It is legitimate.

243
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No, I was just going to say it gives us a bad name.

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It is legitimate.

245
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No, I'm saying for the people out there.

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I know.

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Be legit and ethical.

248
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm not saying use a program to do it or anything.

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't.

250
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Please don't.

251
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm just saying, you know, if you have e-mail addresses you can vote four times.

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Seriously, people that are listening to gaming podcasts are probably so fucking sick about hearing about podcast awards.

253
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So, you know.

254
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, it was just nice to be nominated again.

255
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah, blah, blah, blah.

256
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's always lovely to be nominated.

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But we want to win again, so.

258
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You know what's better than being nominated again?

259
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Winning again.

260
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's what's even better.

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
No, I'm just teasing, really.

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
No, it really is great that we got nominated and the fact that there's like a lot of shows that haven't been in there before and it's all independent.

263
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I hoard us out to my work again.

264
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Those people, those people that do the shows that got nominated, you know, they don't get a lot of, I don't think any of them, I don't think any of them get paid to do their business.

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Screw Attack was on there.

266
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Do they?

267
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't know.

268
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't even know.

269
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, they're affiliated with, you know, game trailers.

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But hey, at least One Up wasn't on there.

271
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You know, at least like IGN wasn't on there.

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Picking fights today with the corporate cast.

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, technically they're video casts.

274
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know if that's true.

275
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I mean, they get paid to do what they do.

276
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So they are, and they have built-in ads and magazines and stuff.

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So all the casts that got nominated, you know, they don't get that same built-in advertising.

278
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
We need this.

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah, we need this.

280
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So do they.

281
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So hooray for nominations.

282
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Okay, we need to change the topic.

283
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Moving on, let's talk about some gaming news.

284
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We'll start it off with a little bit of news from BlizzCon.

285
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Of course, that's the big weekend news.

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And we're going to go over to Xtavor for a full report, but first, if you haven't already heard,

287
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
here's some of the news that came out of BlizzCon.

288
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Wrath of the Lich King, or Lich King.

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Wrath of the Lich King.

290
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It looks like Lich King.

291
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The Lush King.

292
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I like that.

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
How about Wrath of the Lich King?

294
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Have you ever played WoW Drunk?

295
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
How about Wrath of the Lush King?

296
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I've played Final Fantasy Drunk, but not WoW.

297
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I think I've played WoW Drunk.

298
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You've played WoW Drunk.

299
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah, because I sang on Ventrilo.

300
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Wrath of the Dawn King.

301
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So if you're a Mieglatov, it's Wrath of the Lush King, is the new WoW expansion.

302
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And even though there's going to be no new races, there is going to be a new class, Death Knight.

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So that's kind of fun.

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And apparently every race can be a Death Knight, so there's going to be lots of Death Knights.

305
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And I've already reserved the name Death Cake, so you can't have it, for Death Knight.

306
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Well, I was just going to say, you know, if you were like, say, Leroy Jenkins and he was a knight,

307
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
he would be a Death Knight, because he's dead in the game, because he got killed.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Anyways, what's not funny though, is the fact that you may need Burning Crusade,

309
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
in order to play some aspects of Wrath of the Lich King.

310
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Which is not surprising, because I think with Burning Crusade it did raise the level cap,

311
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
and obviously you're not going to be able to go to 80 if you don't have Burning Crusade.

312
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But, they haven't really said exactly what will not be available if you don't have Burning Crusade.

313
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Well also, it should be pointed out, there's some new battlegrounds,

314
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and it's going to have siege warfare and buildings that you can destroy with your siege weapons,

315
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
so that's going to be pretty awesome.

316
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And then supposedly you're going to be able to customize your characters even further than what you can do now.

317
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yes, new hair, I can't wait.

318
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's good, because it is kind of limited right now.

319
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You know what the best thing so far about the expansion is?

320
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What?

321
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's blue, like crazy. I cannot wait.

322
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Because it's ice and cold and all that stuff.

323
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes, it's snowy, and I'm so excited. I could talk for hours about it,

324
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
but I guess it's Christopher's job because he went there.

325
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Well, let's talk to Christopher. How was BlizzCon, Xtavor?

326
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
First of all, how did you go? It was a birthday thing, right?

327
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah, my sister got it for me for my birthday.

328
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Oh, that was sweet, and didn't think to invite us. That's alright.

329
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I know.

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But it's $100 per ticket.

331
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
We would have bought it. We would have bought it now. We were moving. It's all good.

332
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, tell us about, what was it like when he got there? What kind of stuff did they have going on?

333
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, we got there pretty early in the morning on Friday morning because we wanted to get our badges,

334
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
and found out that there wasn't no lines for badges because they had booths everywhere to get your badge.

335
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
A lot of people had been there since 4 o'clock in the morning anyway,

336
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
so we just went up, got our badges, got our swag bags, and waited for the doors to open.

337
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
They opened the doors. When you walked in, it was really dark.

338
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You could see the main hall, which is where they announced the expansion, and it was in bright blue.

339
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yay, blue!

340
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
They had two big screens and a lot of chairs.

341
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Everybody filled up the chairs and people were standing on the sidelines.

342
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
People were blocking everybody's view.

343
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The people that worked there weren't that great at directing everybody.

344
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
People kept on trying to sit down in the middle of the aisles.

345
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
They would sit there for 10 minutes before the people that worked there would tell them to get up.

346
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Anyways, the opening ceremony was pretty good.

347
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
They talked about a lot of stuff, Starcraft 2, World of Warcraft, and they showed us the trailer to the expansion.

348
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That was pretty cool.

349
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I think everybody knew that the expansion was going to be called Wrath of the Lich King,

350
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
because in our maps, there was a specific area that said World of Warcraft, Wrath of the Lich King area.

351
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Everybody was clued in as to what was coming.

352
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Plus, it had been leaked to the internet two days before.

353
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
While you all were driving down, the whole internet knew thanks to some European thing.

354
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I guess the official Blizzard site in Europe leaked it.

355
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So we all know it was Wrath of the Lich King.

356
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah, still some people were skeptical. They thought it was going to be Maelstrom.

357
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But, I don't know.

358
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The Wrath of the Lich King, we got to play it three times.

359
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I personally really liked it.

360
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What was the demo like? What did you do in it?

361
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Well, you start out in the Undercity area and you fly on a...

362
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Whatever that is.

363
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I think your computer just farted.

364
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Okay, for those people not in the studio, that's the pipes from someone next door.

365
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
They're using it and there's air in the pipes.

366
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That was a cool noise.

367
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That was a Silent Hill noise.

368
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That was freaky.

369
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I wish the folks at home could hear that.

370
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Alright, so expansion.

371
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah, we got to play the expansion.

372
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
We start out in Undercity, ride a zeppelin to the new Northrend area.

373
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You don't really know where it is in Northrend, but just that it's in Northrend.

374
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And it's the Howling Fjord or whatever?

375
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes, that's correct.

376
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I just couldn't remember.

377
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There were so many names that you discovered in the expansion.

378
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
We didn't know where we were.

379
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And pretty much you go to this grassy type area first.

380
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
There's a town and you're next to the ocean.

381
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And you can go up, you ride this lift up to the top.

382
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And there's actually in the trailer for Wrath of the Lich King, you see the top of the lift.

383
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So you're kind of excited because you're playing a part that's in the trailer.

384
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Then you can go to the right.

385
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
There's a lot of snowy area you can go into.

386
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And then there was a lot of burning woodsy areas.

387
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay, too much detail.

388
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Did they let you play Death Knight?

389
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Did they let you?

390
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
No, they don't let you play Death Knight.

391
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But they did play that trailer over and over and over and over again.

392
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Did you get to do anything in the demo that you can't really already do in WoW right now?

393
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's, yeah.

394
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's nothing really new.

395
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You can do quests, but they weren't really new.

396
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You could tell that they were holding off on that stuff.

397
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It was just really kind of a way to explore the area.

398
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There was a dungeon you can go to.

399
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And so lots of nerds could go.

400
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You know, I played it first before any of you did in my Murloc suit.

401
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Really, I would say it was a good start.

402
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Good start because you could...

403
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Good effort.

404
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, good effort.

405
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And it wasn't like you couldn't go to the other areas that were already there.

406
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Because one of our players is a mage who can portal you.

407
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And he portaled us to another city.

408
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And it was kind of cool because we were the only three people there.

409
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So yeah, it was kind of cool.

410
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Cool.

411
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
How about StarCraft II?

412
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Did you get a chance to play that?

413
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah.

414
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
StarCraft II.

415
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I've never played StarCraft before, let alone any game like StarCraft.

416
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So I was new to the whole genre.

417
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But I can say that I really liked it.

418
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I really enjoyed it.

419
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Very good graphics.

420
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Very good.

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Lots of detail.

422
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Very hard, I can imagine.

423
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I was on easy mode and it was hard.

424
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It was difficult.

425
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But you were just a noob, that's why.

426
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

427
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But I mean, yeah.

428
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's right.

429
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But it was pretty cool.

430
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And there was...

431
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The whole area was just...

432
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It was just people everywhere.

433
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
There were stores.

434
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
There were lots of stinky people.

435
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Lots of stinky con people.

436
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Actually, there were people from all walks of life.

437
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
There were families there.

438
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Full families.

439
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
There were all fucking alliances.

440
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But that's besides the point.

441
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There were families there.

442
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
There were people that were fat and nasty there.

443
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
There were nerds.

444
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Just skinny, scrawny nerds.

445
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
There were hot people.

446
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I mean, people dressed in blood elf costumes.

447
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah, you were saying before that Leroy Jenkins,

448
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
the guy that does Leroy Jenkins,

449
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
was there because...

450
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He was there.

451
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
You were like...

452
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
He was fucking hot.

453
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
...wetting your pants over that guy.

454
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah.

455
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He actually...

456
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Okay, Jay Moore, who was the DJ of the whole event...

457
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
He did a last comic standing, right?

458
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

459
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Before he got fired.

460
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
He actually...

461
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
He did a really good job.

462
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
There were some hecklers that derailed the closing ceremony for a little bit.

463
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But he pulled it together.

464
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Everybody was laughing.

465
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
He made even the most skeptical people.

466
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
There was one girl behind me that was ragging on him the whole time,

467
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and then she started laughing by the end of the show.

468
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So he was actually pretty good.

469
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I actually enjoyed him.

470
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Had he ever played World of Warcraft or was it just a paycheck?

471
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I think it was just a paycheck, but he did know some things.

472
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But yeah, there were...

473
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There was probably stuff that they told him in the boardroom or whatever

474
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
before he walked out.

475
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But...

476
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
DJ Dark Knight in chat wants to know,

477
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
were there Korean players there?

478
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But he's no Jamie Kennedy, that's for sure.

479
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Actually, there were Korean players there.

480
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Mostly for StarCraft, but there were people that won

481
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
the costume contests in the Korean Invitational that they did a few months ago,

482
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
or a month ago or whatever.

483
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
They actually participated in the costume contest this year,

484
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and it was a warlock and they were done very well,

485
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
but it just so happens there was another warlock that topped them.

486
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And she was just incredible.

487
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
She was like, oh my god, she looked incredible.

488
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But yeah, the Leroy Jenkins guy was there,

489
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and he did his Leroy Jenkins, and he was just too hot for words.

490
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Wow, nerdy.

491
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
How was video games live?

492
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Awesome.

493
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
They did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft, as you can imagine,

494
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
but they also...

495
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Yeah, that's the one who won, I'm sorry.

496
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Anyways, they did a bunch of stuff from World of Warcraft,

497
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
but they also did the new music from StarCraft II,

498
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
which was sucky because it sounded exactly like Star Wars.

499
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But we got to hear that, and we got to hear lots of music from Diablo,

500
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and there was also a band that played last night.

501
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
They were like this horde band.

502
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It was totally manufactured by the makers of WoW,

503
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
you could tell because the creator of WoW was in the band.

504
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
But nevertheless, they were funny.

505
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
What were they called? Level 70?

506
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Level 70 Elite, Tauren Chieftain.

507
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Did they actually dress up like Tauren?

508
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
No, they actually didn't.

509
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Like they were Gwar or something?

510
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
They didn't, but they did.

511
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
When you went and waited in the line to play Wrath of the Lich King,

512
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
there was a big screen next to them,

513
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and they kept playing the video that was game made.

514
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
They made it in the in-game video for that,

515
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
and it was just incredibly ridiculous, but it was funny, I guess.

516
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But they have a song called Rogues Do It From Behind,

517
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
which was just funny because I'm a rogue,

518
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and I do it from behind.

519
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I think I just threw up in my mouth, thank you.

520
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I was going for that.

521
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
If only there was a camera to capture everybody's expressions just then.

522
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So yeah, the whole show was pretty good.

523
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I had such a fun time.

524
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Good deal. Anything else you want to share

525
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
that you think our listeners ought to know about?

526
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What was the funniest thing that happened all show?

527
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
The funniest thing?

528
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah.

529
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh God, all the nerds asking stupid questions at the panels.

530
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
They would say stuff like,

531
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
okay, we're not going to answer these questions,

532
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and what do the nerds fucking do?

533
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Give us an example.

534
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The movie panel, you said which one, right?

535
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Movie panel, okay, that was a big thing.

536
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
They're actually doing a movie,

537
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
the same people who did Batman Returns,

538
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
or Batman Begins, Superman Returns, legendary 300 or whatever.

539
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
They are doing the movie, and they are really standing by this film.

540
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
There were questions that they wouldn't answer, though,

541
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
and those were,

542
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
we won't answer questions on which races, which characters will be in the movies,

543
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
but you can expect to maybe see these,

544
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and they listed these characters, right?

545
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Everybody cheered.

546
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Okay, then the question answer comes,

547
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
what do the fucking gamers ask?

548
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
What races and characters are going to be in the game?

549
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Can you please tell us?

550
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Okay, didn't you fucking hear?

551
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You're wasting our time when other people can be asking,

552
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
like, actually informative questions, you know?

553
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So it was kind of, you know, annoying,

554
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
but Dark Knight wants to know, he would have asked,

555
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and will we be hearing back me wool in the movie anywhere?

556
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
We should.

557
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Get in the archives if you don't get that joke.

558
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
In fact, they said that there's going to be a lot of humor carried over from the game,

559
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
so they're looking forward to carrying some of the humor,

560
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
but still keep it on a serious level.

561
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You didn't tell them about what the worst part of the movie is so far.

562
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Oh, well, they're going to tell it from the Alliance perspective.

563
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Boo, Alliance sucks.

564
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah, and the funny thing about it is that most people there,

565
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
we got the feeling that most people there were in the Horde,

566
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
which is funny because most people that play the game are Alliance,

567
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
but they're all kids that can't afford to go to BlizzCon.

568
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Son of Dad is in chat, wants to know who's directing the film, did they say?

569
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
They don't have a director. There was somebody that asked that.

570
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
They want to get the script all together first before they go search for a director,

571
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and he said, oh, there was a funny story.

572
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The guy that is with Legendary said that the guy who played Superman last year,

573
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
he said they won't go into casting details,

574
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
but they did say that last year he overheard the Legendary people on the phone with the WoW people,

575
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and he said, oh, my God, can you get me a backstage tour of where they do WoW and all this stuff,

576
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and they did, and he went.

577
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I seem to remember hearing something about that that guy was a WoW player,

578
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
the guy who was Superman. Funny.

579
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Oh, he'd make a pretty blood elf.

580
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yeah, he would.

581
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh, they did give kind of a, not a spoiler, but they gave us an idea of where they're going with the film.

582
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
The very end of the panel, they showed a picture, which is an artist's rendition of what might go on,

583
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and they showed, what is it, the tree, the big tree?

584
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Oh, tell the blah, blah, blah.

585
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Yeah, the night elf tree. I can't remember. I'm not Alliance.

586
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Whatever. Fuck it. But it was a really pretty picture, and everybody went crazy.

587
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
So, telladristle. That's what it is.

588
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Something like that, yeah.

589
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah, but it was really fun.

590
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And I recommend, I think that the best part, well, one of the best parts for me besides the expansion

591
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
was the fact that I actually did like StarCraft II. I think people should give it a try if you haven't.

592
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I also miss the boat on StarCraft I, but what's crazy is that my boyfriend loves StarCraft.

593
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It's like the only video game he plays is StarCraft, and he is all excited about StarCraft II.

594
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So, it's just kind of interesting.

595
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Because he's Asian.

596
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Shut up. Let's see, looking at chat, another comment here.

597
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Darktitsui wants to know, will the WoW movie be 60 hours long?

598
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
That would be awesome.

599
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
They said it's going to be between two and two and a half hours long.

600
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Well, yes, it will be 60 hours long, but then you can buy an expansion for just $39.95 that will expand it to 70 hours long.

601
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah, it was kind of funny because one of the people on the panel made a comment,

602
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
well, this first one will be blah, blah, blah.

603
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And everybody was like, oh, my God, sequel.

604
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Somebody, some stupid dumbass asked a question about a sequel.

605
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
They're like, okay, you guys, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

606
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Let's make sure we knock this one out of the park first and then go on for sequel.

607
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
All right, we're going to have to have a whole sequel to the show to cover all the BlizzCon news.

608
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
We've got to get on to some other news.

609
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
RosteelUT in chat is pulling up a pillow and blanket because he just doesn't care about WoW.

610
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
We don't care about whoever that was that you just said.

611
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I don't care about WoW either.

612
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
All right, are you doing okay over there, Loki?

613
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm doing fine.

614
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
All right, well, let's get on to some other news.

615
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Thank you guys very much for your respective con reports.

616
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Actually, Mikotov, yours was kind of bad.

617
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I didn't really care about your report.

618
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Whatever, I didn't even really talk about it.

619
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yeah, you didn't really do anything.

620
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Well, I could talk about it more, but I don't want to because it's true.

621
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Tell us really, I don't know, maybe if they don't like World of Warcraft, they like Battlestar,

622
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
but please tell me about how you met the guy that played Tyrrell and what you did.

623
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Okay, spoilers maybe, just so everybody knows.

624
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
The guy that plays Tyrrell, Aaron Douglas, was at Comic Con, and I went to go get his autograph.

625
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I went up to him, and I was like,

626
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
can you write something mean about Callie?

627
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Callie sucks, and Callie is his wife on the show, and I absolutely hate her.

628
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
He laughed at me, and then he started signing my thing I gave him to sign.

629
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
He put, to Shane, Aaron Douglas, chief.

630
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I can't wait for Callie to die in season four, episode five, dot, dot, dot.

631
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
That was my favorite thing ever, and now I have something to look forward to.

632
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'd just like to point out that Shane called me long distance, like right after this happened,

633
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
just to tell me about this experience.

634
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Because it's important.

635
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
It was like the coolest thing ever because I hate her a lot.

636
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
He's known to give away spoilers and stuff like that, so that could really be a real spoiler.

637
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Well, there was one other convention going on that, unfortunately,

638
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
OLR did not have any representation at, but certainly there's a lot of news coming from QuakeCon,

639
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
and John Carmack at QuakeCon announced a brand new franchise for ID Software.

640
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
That would be Rage.

641
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Rage is going to be like an action-adventure game,

642
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and it's from a brand new engine that ID Software is doing called Tech Five.

643
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It's going to be simultaneously launched on the PC, the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360,

644
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and believe it or not, the Mac.

645
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah, originally when they were showing off the Tech Five demo, or Tech Five,

646
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I guess it was a demonstration of it, they were actually showing off bits of Rage,

647
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
and it's kind of got a little bit of driving in there.

648
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
There's a bit of first-person shooter stuff in there as well,

649
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
so it's kind of like Motorstorm meets Quake.

650
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
In fact, here's a quote from Todd Hallensheet, the CEO of ID Software.

651
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It's more than just a first-person shooter.

652
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
We will show vehicles and racetracks, driving and racing elements.

653
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It is an action-oriented game, but with a lot of adventure elements.

654
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It will be story-driven, but you can also choose your own route to go through things.

655
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
As long as it's better than Quake 4,

656
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
because Quake 4 held my interest for about three seconds,

657
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and I was like, eh, not interested.

658
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yeah, well hopefully this will hold your interest for a little bit longer than that.

659
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Quake Arena is headed to Xbox Live Arcade.

660
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Now this is something we kind of knew a little bit of before

661
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
when the ESRB kind of leaked that out,

662
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
but apparently they had some really good success

663
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
with the Doom franchise on Xbox Live Arcade,

664
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
so now they're hoping to repeat that with Quake.

665
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And I'm assuming it is going to be kind of like Unreal Tournament type of thing,

666
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
but with Quake, so awesome.

667
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
When I first read about this, though, I was thinking,

668
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
is this like the old-school version of Quake, but just adapted for Xbox Live?

669
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It might be, I don't know.

670
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Is that like the original Nine Inch Nails soundtrack and all that?

671
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't think so.

672
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Oh, I'll be sad.

673
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I have fond memories of Quake.

674
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
This was back in the day when broadband you could only find in colleges, right?

675
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Broadband was not really sold for commercial use,

676
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
and my friends went to college in the Bay Area,

677
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
and I used to call in dial-up to their broadband connection,

678
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and we would play Quake.

679
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
About three of them in the dorms and then me on dial-up,

680
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
we'd stay up all night long playing Quake. It was awesome.

681
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You couldn't do that with Duke Nukem Forever for some reason.

682
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I don't know.

683
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Because it never came out.

684
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Perhaps this is another game people will stay up all night playing, though.

685
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I don't know. It's a game called Quake Zero.

686
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm going to take a wild guess and see that it's probably Quake 3 Arena

687
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
coming to Xbox Live Arcade since...

688
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Actually, it's different.

689
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Quake Zero is going to cost zero.

690
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That's why it's called Quake Zero. It's free.

691
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I understand that, but the port of Quake 3 Arena...

692
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh, so the Quake Arena game...

693
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Well, that would be awesome. Quake 3 is my favorite.

694
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Well, there you go.

695
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Oh, that would be great.

696
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Well, anyway, Quake Zero is going to be a web-based version of Quake 3 multiplayer,

697
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
so you can just fire up your web browser and play.

698
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Because, I don't know, has the source code been out for Quake 3?

699
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I can't remember.

700
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It doesn't matter because it's being developed in-house anyway, so they have it.

701
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But they're going to be putting it out there,

702
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and I guess it's going to be ad-supported.

703
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It's going to have some in-game advertising.

704
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That's how it's really going to be zero dollars.

705
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But free is good.

706
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Man, I would love to see Quake, and I'm playing it,

707
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
and then there's a McDonald's ad or something.

708
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That would make it totally realistic.

709
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Dark Tetsuya says,

710
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
LOL Quake Zero. Zero calories, zero sugar.

711
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I guess, you know, from all that sitting...

712
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
More caffeine.

713
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
More caffeine, exactly.

714
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Nintendo Maniac 64 said,

715
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I wonder if Quake Zero will be anything like Phosphor when it runs on Shockwave.

716
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
RosteelUT says,

717
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yeah, ID released the source code ages ago.

718
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I thought I remembered reading something about that.

719
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Now if only Quake Zero were compatible with the Wii web browser.

720
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Which I honestly doubt it would be.

721
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
But we can hope.

722
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
One thing that will be compatible though,

723
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
they announced Unreal Tournament 3,

724
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
which is going to be coming out on PlayStation 3 later this year.

725
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It's going to be supporting keyboard and mouse.

726
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So that's kind of cool.

727
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I know a lot of people really love keyboard and mouse,

728
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
especially playing PC first person shooters.

729
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So now you can actually do that on the console

730
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
and kind of have a fair shake at people playing on PC.

731
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Or as the people playing on PC.

732
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
That's kind of cool because that will put that whole debate to rest finally.

733
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
People can take it out.

734
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
What is better, the controller or the keyboard and mouse?

735
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
People can finally duke it out.

736
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Unreal Tournament 3 for the PS3 is actually kind of shaping up more like a PC game.

737
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I mean, obviously it is a PC game as well.

738
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But with the fact that you can download mods for it.

739
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That is pretty awesome.

740
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I got to hand it to PlayStation 3 for that.

741
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
It's going to be sweet.

742
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
We will see.

743
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Bravens Dolphin in chat says,

744
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Bluetooth mouse and keyboard for the win.

745
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Tiger Claw said,

746
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Unreal Tournament 3 players with keyboard and mouse

747
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
will pwn the UT3 players with the 6 axis.

748
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Well it's not like the keyboard and mouse are going to vibrate either.

749
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So you got that.

750
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Also some other news coming out of QuakeCon.

751
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Is this coming out of QuakeCon or is this just about the same time?

752
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It's about the same time.

753
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It might be out of QuakeCon.

754
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
We will see here.

755
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Actually this story is coming from Ain't It Cool News.

756
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Which is kind of interesting.

757
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Roger Avery is working on an adaptation of Castle Wolfenstein.

758
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Fuck yeah.

759
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Apparently it's actually returned to Castle Wolfenstein.

760
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And apparently the producer of Silent Hill,

761
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Samuel Hadida already has the rights to it.

762
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And he gave the property over to Roger Avery to write and direct.

763
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And if I'm not mistaken, Roger Avery did the script for Silent Hill, right?

764
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I think so.

765
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I think so.

766
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Didn't he?

767
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I don't know, but I know he's not doing it again.

768
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I know he was tied to it.

769
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh yeah, we talked about that a couple weeks ago.

770
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Well I'm talking about it now, so continue your story.

771
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
We'll see.

772
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
According to Ain't It Cool News,

773
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
they expect we'll see World War 2 crazy tongue-in-cheek horror sci-fi action.

774
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I wonder if you'll get Hitler in the big mech like you fought in the game.

775
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
That would be kind of strange.

776
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It sounds horrific for Uwe Boll, though.

777
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Oh.

778
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I forgot to mention that earlier.

779
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I interviewed Uwe Boll this week.

780
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
What the hell?

781
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
How did you not mention this to me?

782
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
People turned the show off ten minutes ago.

783
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Sorry.

784
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
With all the loud talk.

785
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I forgot.

786
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You met Uwe Boll?

787
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I didn't meet him.

788
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I interviewed him over the phone, though.

789
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Oh, okay.

790
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But not for this show.

791
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I interviewed him for my work.

792
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
What the hell?

793
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Alright, well what happened?

794
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Did you find anything else?

795
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Okay, well here's the thing.

796
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I had to watch his movie, BloodRayne 2 Deliverance,

797
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and it's horrible, as you would expect,

798
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
but it was a vampire western,

799
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and so we got to interview him about that,

800
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and I asked him a few things.

801
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
A vampire western?

802
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
It's a vampire western, yes it is.

803
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That could be cool, though.

804
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It could be cool, but it's not.

805
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
No.

806
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So, now obviously the interview was tame

807
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
because, you know, it was for a magazine,

808
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
so we had to be positive about the whole thing,

809
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
but we did ask him about the boxing stuff.

810
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That was kind of funny.

811
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I actually have the whole interview transcribed

812
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
on the Orange Lounge live journal community,

813
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
so if you want to check it out there,

814
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
you can see everything we talked about.

815
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
We also talked about there's a new movie he's doing

816
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
called Tunnel Rats that's being made into a game

817
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
at the same time,

818
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
so that's kind of an interesting thing,

819
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
and then of course Postal's coming out this year.

820
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
They had a lot of advertisement at Comic Con for Postal.

821
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It was weird.

822
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
As crazy and bad as his movies are,

823
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I really want to see Postal.

824
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I think this is reverse psychology.

825
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I think this is brilliant marketing

826
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
where somehow they're getting the word out there

827
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
that the movie is brilliant.

828
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Like, there were preview screenings already, right?

829
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah, and people are saying it's pretty funny.

830
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
The whole thing is going to be offensive,

831
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
so that's all that matters.

832
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So we got to talk to him.

833
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
He's a very interesting guy, but I don't know.

834
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Okay, interesting is a very broad word

835
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
because you could know a guy that picks his nose

836
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
and eats it and you could go,

837
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
that's really interesting.

838
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I kind of felt bad for him a little bit

839
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
because he's not trying to make awesome movies.

840
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
He's just trying to make genre flicks

841
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and he just happens to use video games

842
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
to kind of supplement that to get more of an audience.

843
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I don't know.

844
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
He's kind of an underachiever, I guess.

845
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Who gets out of bed in the morning and goes,

846
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I want to make a vampire westerner?

847
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Film students?

848
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I guess so.

849
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I think we should make Orange Lawns Radio the movie

850
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
and it should be a vampire western.

851
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Okay, the movie itself I knew was bad

852
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
like within the first two minutes.

853
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I watched the whole movie and fast-forward

854
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
because I couldn't stand it.

855
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Luckily though, I got to hear most of the dialogue

856
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
because it was really slow.

857
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
The only bad thing about it, there was no nudity.

858
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
That kind of sucked.

859
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But, Zach Ward, the guy that plays the main character

860
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
in the Postal movie, he played Billy the Kid, the vampire.

861
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I kind of liked him in that.

862
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I thought he was a good vampire

863
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
and here's why he was a good vampire.

864
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
He would hurt innocent people without a thought.

865
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
For example, the very end of the movie,

866
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
she's going to rescue these kids

867
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
because he's going to bite them all and turn them

868
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and make them more immortal or something.

869
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
She walks in and this trap springs

870
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and basically all the kids get hung.

871
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Awesome!

872
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
She's pushing this counterweight back

873
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
so the kids don't die, but unfortunately

874
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
one of the little kids dies.

875
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
That's so good.

876
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
There's stuff like that throughout the whole movie.

877
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And they're not afraid to hurt innocent little children

878
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
in the movie.

879
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I can respect that.

880
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So, I don't know.

881
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Wow.

882
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Anyways.

883
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Kill children, earn points for Loki.

884
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Actually, I got to say real quick

885
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
is that Robert M. in our chatroom

886
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
at chatonorangelandradio.com

887
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
has the first piece of casting news

888
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
for Orange Lounge Radio, the new vampire western movie.

889
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Loki has been cast to play Tingle.

890
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Amazing.

891
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
There is no Tingle in this movie.

892
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
But where will we get our rupees?

893
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Anyways, moving on to something completely opposite of that.

894
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Lego Indiana Jones was announced at Comic Con

895
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
because there aren't enough Lego franchises yet

896
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
and they're going to milk that for every penny that they can.

897
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Lego games aren't that bad.

898
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
They aren't that bad.

899
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I can think of worse games.

900
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I can think of far worse games.

901
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
They aren't that bad.

902
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So, following Lego Batman this year

903
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
you're going to be seeing Lego Indiana Jones next year.

904
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And I want Lego Batman, by the way.

905
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
That'll be pretty cool.

906
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Well, it's a pity that Jamie isn't here

907
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
because she would probably be running circles around this story.

908
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm very happy about this one.

909
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Apparently, there is a Doctor Who video game

910
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
that could be on its way for Christmas.

911
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Top Trumps has revealed a plan for a Doctor Who video game

912
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
to be released in time for Christmas 2007.

913
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's thought to be available on the PC, PlayStation 2, DS, and mobile games.

914
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Apparently, an advertisement for the game appears

915
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
in the new Doctor Who Top Trumps card pack.

916
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
But now, I want to say that I saw a follow-up story to this

917
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
that said this actually may not be true.

918
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
That there was a retraction to this story that came out a little later.

919
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So, it could be a little bit iffy, but

920
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I mean, Doctor Who seems perfect for a video game.

921
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I mean, I don't remember where I read this.

922
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It was one of the blog sites, so I apologize for not giving you credit.

923
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But, they put it brilliantly.

924
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
They said, this is good news and bad news.

925
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
The good news is it's a Doctor Who video game.

926
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
The bad news is it's a Doctor Who video game

927
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
because video games that are based off of TV shows and stuff

928
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
usually don't go too well.

929
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
That's true, but remember they announced that Battle Star game

930
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
for Xbox Live Arcade a while back?

931
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It came out last week, I think.

932
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Did it actually come out?

933
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Oh, Battle Star. I'm sorry. I'm thinking Wing Commander.

934
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh, no. Battle Star. I know it's on PartnerNet

935
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
and my friends that work at EA have been playing it

936
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
and they actually said it's a pretty fun game, even though

937
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,000
they're hardcore fans and it really is a typical space shooter

938
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
with Battle Star just plastered on it.

939
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Nothing really Battle Star related beyond that.

940
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So, you get occasional gems and I hope to goodness that

941
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
the Heroes game that Ubisoft is doing is going to be good.

942
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:57,000
There's no need to really worry about games that come from TV shows, I think.

943
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I guess that's a little bit more encouraging there.

944
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Well, there is another interesting rumor that's come out recently

945
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
and this is one that has me extremely excited.

946
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Apparently, EGM has run their rumor mill story from Quarterman.

947
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
He does this every month.

948
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And the rumor is that apparently they were, I believe, level 5.

949
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
They developed some RPGs and stuff.

950
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Oh, actually, no. They weren't the ones that developed this. My mistake.

951
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Anyways, Bionic Commando.

952
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It was originally going to be made into a PlayStation Network game.

953
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
However, they decided that they're just going to make it into a full-fledged game instead.

954
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So, possibly a Bionic Commando game soon.

955
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That would be all kinds of rad because that's like an old series

956
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
that a lot of people would like to see get brought back.

957
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Hell yeah.

958
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I'd be very happy about that.

959
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
As long as they don't turn it into a completely different game.

960
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
You know what I mean?

961
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Try to keep some of the elements that made the first one fun.

962
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I would not want to see Bionic Commando go 3D.

963
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
That would not be fun for me.

964
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
But, I don't know.

965
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
If they did it like if it was as good as the Rygar game,

966
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
when they updated that, that wasn't too bad, I think.

967
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But...

968
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Dark Tetsuya in our chat room, chat.orangelandradar.com says,

969
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Dear Capcom Wii version. K, thanks.

970
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
That could be interesting.

971
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I don't know. We'll see.

972
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Well, there's some games that you will no longer be playing

973
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
if you're a fan of EA online games because they're pulling the online support

974
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
for lots and lots of EA games as of September 1st, 2007.

975
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Nothing very recent.

976
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
The majority of the list comes from all the sports games released in 2006,

977
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
such as Madden NFL 06, NASCAR 06, FIFA World Cup 06.

978
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
All those are shutting down.

979
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And I guess the thought is that most of you will have upgraded to 08 by that point,

980
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
if not at least 07.

981
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
But I haven't upgraded from Madden 06.

982
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Why do you own Madden 06?

983
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Don't you mean you have an upgrade from Madden 99?

984
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
That is so not your kind of game, I thought.

985
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
It's not.

986
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Is it achievement points?

987
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
No.

988
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
You're a whore.

989
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You're a whore for achievement points.

990
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Some other games have been getting shut down, though.

991
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Surprisingly, November 1st of 07, Burnout Revenge on Xbox and Playstation 2.

992
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
So they're shutting off one of the Burnout titles

993
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
and the Need for Speed Underground and Most Wanted

994
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
also getting the plug pulled on them November 1st of 07.

995
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Well, Underground's damn old and Revenge technically on,

996
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
well, the Xbox is the latest one.

997
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But Playstation, I mean, they had Dominator, so...

998
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Oh, well.

999
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Well, if you're one of the five people that plays these games online still,

1000
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
then you're probably pretty angsty.

1001
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So we dedicate the FUs of the Week just for you.

1002
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Now, usually we would have music here, but since we're in our temper...

1003
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun...

1004
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Hey, that's the music.

1005
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
We can find music.

1006
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That's too late now.

1007
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
We're live, remember?

1008
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Alright, so there we go.

1009
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
There's your music.

1010
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And it's the FUs of the Week time.

1011
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So, Loki, start us off tonight.

1012
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,000
My FU of the Week goes to Genki for just porting the Playstation 2 version

1013
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
of Wangen Midnight to the Playstation 3.

1014
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I mean, come on.

1015
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Spend a little bit more time.

1016
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Hell, that fucking lame-ass game import tuner challenge that came out

1017
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
on the Xbox 360 looked better than this.

1018
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
That's sad.

1019
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And, you know, maybe some better music in it, too,

1020
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
because that's kind of sad, too.

1021
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yeah, music like that.

1022
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
My next FU goes to Shane for not shutting his cell phone off

1023
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
during the recording of the show.

1024
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1025
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
My other FU goes to Comcast for making me suffer without internet

1026
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
until Tuesday, and also to whichever mystery neighbor

1027
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I'm stealing Wi-Fi from for not being strong enough.

1028
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Although, I will give it this, like yesterday,

1029
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
the strength of the Wi-Fi was perfect, and I was able to download

1030
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
torrents of Big Brother to get all caught up on Big Brother 8.

1031
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So, and Jen sucks, just for the record.

1032
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Shane, do you have any FUs of the Wii?

1033
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I can come up with one real quick.

1034
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
FU to Blizzard for not giving me the expansion for free,

1035
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
or telling me when it's going to come out, because I really want it,

1036
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
and it's really all I've been reading about since they announced it.

1037
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Like, me and the internet, that's all we do,

1038
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
is just talk about the WoW expansion.

1039
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Alright, let's get back into some news.

1040
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Anyways, another cool game that's going to be heading our way pretty soon.

1041
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Crysis has been announced to be released on November 16th,

1042
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
and that game looks damn good, and I really want to build a PC for it.

1043
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Tell us a little more about this game, I don't know much about it.

1044
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Crysis is the next game in the series of, I guess, Far Cry,

1045
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
even though there is Far Cry 2.

1046
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Oh, that's right, I've heard of this.

1047
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
But it's just, I mean, the original Far Cry game was pretty good looking.

1048
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
This one now is just phenomenal, the amount of detail that's in the game,

1049
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
just the amount of physics, I mean, you can blow up everything in the game,

1050
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
you know, everything has real world looks good,

1051
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
the draw distance is enormous, just, it's amazing.

1052
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
So, it also is going to be a resource hog, I'm guessing.

1053
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Is it, like, in the future compared to Far Cry?

1054
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Because, I mean, I don't know much about Far Cry,

1055
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
but, like, box art right there looks like it's crazy,

1056
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
like, 2000 years in the future.

1057
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It's in the future, I'm assuming.

1058
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Basically, it's still on, like, a tropical island type thing.

1059
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Aliens have kind of either crash landed in one section of the map,

1060
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and so, you know, you have this whole section that's kind of 0G and, like, frozen.

1061
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So, it's interesting stuff there,

1062
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
plus the whole suit that you have is, like, a nano suit that you can upgrade.

1063
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Like, you can switch it to, like, speed, so all your powers are in your speed,

1064
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
and you can move around really fast, or armor, or stealth, and stuff like that.

1065
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So, really cool looking.

1066
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
That could be interesting.

1067
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Well, this is also interesting, and that is SingStar is continuing

1068
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
to do a lot of business and coming out with new games.

1069
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I guess this is mostly in Europe, though.

1070
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I have not heard of SingStar really taking off in this country.

1071
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
There's another one coming out this month, actually.

1072
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
My gosh.

1073
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
SingStar amped in the US.

1074
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Maybe they are doing really well there,

1075
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and I think this is coming out in the US as well.

1076
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
This is SingStar Anthems,

1077
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
and it's actually, I got to hand it to them.

1078
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
This is actually a pretty kick-ass song list.

1079
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
If you like your power ballads and your anthems,

1080
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
this is a pretty kick-ass song list.

1081
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Anastasia, Left Outside Alone.

1082
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I actually like that song.

1083
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Probably no one else has heard of it.

1084
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Avril Lavigne, I'm With You.

1085
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Cindy Lauper, Time After Time.

1086
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
You DDR fans, the original version of Ordinary World by Duran Duran is in this.

1087
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Alone by Heart.

1088
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
That's a hell of a power ballad.

1089
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Two songs by Mr. Mister.

1090
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
That's awesome.

1091
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You get broken wings.

1092
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And Queen, The Show Must Go On,

1093
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Roxette, a couple Roxette songs in there.

1094
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
What Roxette songs?

1095
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
It must have been Love, of course.

1096
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But what's the other one?

1097
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Listen to Your Heart.

1098
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Oh.

1099
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I wanted Joyride.

1100
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I don't care.

1101
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
That's not a power ballad.

1102
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And then the ultimate, the ultimate power ballad, Meat Loaf.

1103
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I'd Do Anything For Love, but I wouldn't do that.

1104
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
That is all kinds of awesome.

1105
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I do agree with what Joystiq said when they reported on this.

1106
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And that would be, this game is shit without Journey.

1107
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
How can you have a ballads game and have no Journey?

1108
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Where's my Don't Stop Believin'?

1109
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Is that on the Sony Open Arms?

1110
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Is it on the Sony label?

1111
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Because that's all they get are songs from the label.

1112
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Probably not then.

1113
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Surprise, Open Arms isn't on there.

1114
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I know.

1115
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
How can you have, pay whatever it takes to get Open Arms in this game.

1116
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Or Don't Stop Believin'.

1117
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Sony can't afford to buy things right now.

1118
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
They're all poor with the PS3 stuff.

1119
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Oh, whatever.

1120
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
But if they want this game to take off, they will invest the money in it.

1121
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I'm curious to see what Chad says about this.

1122
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Oh, no, they're still commenting on Crysis.

1123
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
RawsteelUT says, ooh Crysis, a generic first person shooter game with an extra graphical effort.

1124
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It's not that generic.

1125
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It looks pretty awesome.

1126
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Whatever.

1127
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Son of Dad says karaoke in the US only belongs in bars.

1128
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Yeah, but what if you have a bar at home?

1129
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Like you have a bunch of liquor at home.

1130
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
That's acceptable, right?

1131
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
You know, that's false because a lot of people I know love playing the karaoke games at parties and stuff.

1132
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's really fun to do.

1133
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Robert M. suggests Foreigner, Poison.

1134
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Son of Dad also says he wants the final countdown.

1135
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Yes.

1136
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
That would be awesome.

1137
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I just got 2DX 4th Style finally and I love that song so much.

1138
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Is that part of the economy liquidation sale?

1139
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Yes.

1140
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Brand new 2DX 4th Style.

1141
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
The 5 figure sale economy.

1142
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Whatever.

1143
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It was free.

1144
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
You know, I found something the other day actually.

1145
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
What?

1146
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I found it today.

1147
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I have a DDR club append.

1148
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I don't even know where the hell that came from.

1149
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
How random.

1150
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It might be mine.

1151
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I used to have both those games.

1152
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Maybe.

1153
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
You probably have it from when we used to live together years ago.

1154
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
No, I think Jamie gave it to me.

1155
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
She gave you a club append?

1156
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I think those things are actually worth kind of money.

1157
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
No, I doubt it.

1158
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Those are the DDR games nobody fucking played.

1159
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Who played club append?

1160
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I did.

1161
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I didn't play it anyways because I don't have second mix so it's completely useless to me.

1162
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It did have a lot of crap on it though.

1163
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Let's talk about release dates, shall we?

1164
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And we'll travel to Europe first even though Jamie's not here tonight.

1165
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I've got her back and it's really not a long list this week.

1166
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,000
On August 10th over in Europe you guys are getting Pac-Man Rally on the PSP.

1167
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Congratulations.

1168
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
That's really it.

1169
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
That's everything that's on the list that we've got.

1170
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
They get a crappy game for a crappy system.

1171
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Wow.

1172
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Good job.

1173
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
You want to wait for some busier weeks.

1174
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Get to the 31st when you guys are getting Boogie and Guild Wars, Eyes of the North,

1175
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and Medal of Honor.

1176
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Or the 24th when you guys are getting mad at NFL.

1177
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And the game named after Loki.

1178
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You're ruining all the future release dates.

1179
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Sorry.

1180
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Jamie's going to be so angry.

1181
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I feel bad because there's only one freaking release this week.

1182
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
So I'm trying to give him something to look forward to.

1183
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I don't think Europe is filled with Pac-Man Rally fans.

1184
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I mean, if I'm wrong.

1185
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It was.

1186
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It's a huge release for them.

1187
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
If I'm wrong, Europe folks, please send us an email.

1188
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Mailbag at orangeontree.com and please tell us how much you love Pac-Man Rally and how

1189
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
you're going to be camping outside.

1190
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Send us your pictures from camping outside games.

1191
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I want to go camp for Pac-Man Rally.

1192
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You want to hear something?

1193
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I'm lining up.

1194
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
You want to hear something about the stupid rally games that they have in Europe?

1195
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,000
We keep getting fucking some, was it SVG or something, one of these smaller distributors

1196
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
out there keeps publishing this European crap that comes over here.

1197
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
For example, they have Crazy Frog Racer because ooh, we really need a game based off that

1198
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
annoying piece of shit.

1199
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Then there's this Cocoto Racer thing which is like some little devil looking thing.

1200
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I don't know.

1201
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Too many kart racing games in Europe.

1202
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,000
However, though, in the U.S. there's not a whole lot coming out of this week, but there

1203
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
is a lot more than in the U.K.

1204
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
For example, on PSP we've got Crazy Taxi Fair War, also Tomb Raider Anniversary, that's

1205
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
going to be coming out.

1206
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:28,000
On the DS you've got Mega Man, Star Force Pegasus, and Star Force Leo, and if you're

1207
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
buying through GameStop, Star Force Dragon.

1208
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Also, we've got Glory Days 2, which is supposed to be a pretty good kind of a side scroller

1209
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
or strategy game.

1210
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
On the Wii, Boogie is going to be coming out.

1211
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:50,000
It's kind of a scene in karaoke game, or dancing in karaoke game.

1212
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,000
PlayStation 3, nothing, although I do believe that Splinter Cell Double Agent I thought

1213
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
was coming out this week.

1214
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I don't know.

1215
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:07,000
And then on PC, aww, no Tycoon game this week.

1216
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
That's a first.

1217
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Damn.

1218
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You know, I was really hoping.

1219
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Pac-Man Rally Tycoon is coming out on the PC, go figure.

1220
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
No, there's Attack on Pearl Harbor, so that's kind of cool.

1221
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And, I don't know.

1222
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Star Defender 3, woohoo.

1223
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Alright, well coming out in Japan, Japan's also kind of having a bit of a slow week when

1224
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
it comes to game releases, but they do have one big one that a lot of folks are looking

1225
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
forward to.

1226
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,000
On the PlayStation 2, Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System is coming out this week.

1227
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
The dumbest name for a game.

1228
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It's basically the International Zodiac Job System.

1229
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
It's the international version.

1230
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Yeah, the international version that doesn't go anywhere but Japan.

1231
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
It doesn't get released anywhere else.

1232
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I know, but there will be people importing it.

1233
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
There are, I believe it's just the voiceovers, you can select English options.

1234
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I don't think the text is English.

1235
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Oh, because that would be awesome if it was in English because then you could import it.

1236
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Well, most of the other international versions is what people did.

1237
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Like Kingdom Hearts II Final Men just for chains of memories on PS2.

1238
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
But the text wasn't English, I thought.

1239
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I thought it was just the voices.

1240
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I'm not sure, to be honest, because I already have Final Fantasy XII and I could care less

1241
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
about new systems.

1242
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But you get to do new International Zodiac Jobs.

1243
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Yippee.

1244
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Whatever that means.

1245
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I think it meant that you're supposed to cater your characters to more like one classic class.

1246
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Like one of them is more like a red mage and the other one is more like a black mage.

1247
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
They had new classes too or something, funny languages because it wasn't English.

1248
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Also coming out, which we should note, on the DS, the DS has a little bit more releases.

1249
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Of course, there's another Yu-Gi-Oh! game coming out, Yu-Gi-Oh!

1250
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Dual Monsters GX.

1251
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And also coming out, we should say, on Nintendo's DS from Nintendo,

1252
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Donkey Kong Jungle Climber or the King of Swing is coming out in Japan as well.

1253
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
King of Swing 2, basically.

1254
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And Looking at SP.

1255
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Hey, there's a Professional Atlas Travel Guide.

1256
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
That would be the most fun game ever.

1257
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I want to look up where Rome is at.

1258
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Wild Arms XF or Wild Arms Crossfire.

1259
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
You can also look forward to that.

1260
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It's not as cool as Dust Cap 2.

1261
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I know.

1262
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Not as cool as Dust Cap 2.

1263
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Definitely.

1264
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Well, that's it.

1265
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
That's all the release dates I'm going to care to name this week.

1266
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Well, one upcoming release that we're going to get some more information about at Tokyo

1267
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Game Show this year is Metal Gear Solid 4, where it's rumored that the game will actually

1268
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
have a release date announced.

1269
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Although, we're probably guessing March right now.

1270
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So, we just had a story about naming a date where they're going to name a release date.

1271
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Damn it!

1272
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I did it again!

1273
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I thought we said no more of these stories about naming a date where they're going to

1274
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
have a date.

1275
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
This is so stupid.

1276
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I'm sorry, why do people get excited about this?

1277
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
No, it's okay.

1278
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Fired!

1279
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
No, we can't fire Loki.

1280
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Or else, where else would we record this week?

1281
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
We'd be screwed.

1282
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Yeah.

1283
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Alright.

1284
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Some other things to note really quickly.

1285
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Some releases coming out in Europe.

1286
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Super Paper Mario is finally coming out in Europe on September 14th, speaking of dates.

1287
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Can you believe it?

1288
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
It's coming out for 35 pounds in Europe.

1289
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Wow, that's probably how much weight you gained waiting for this game to come out, I guess.

1290
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I don't know.

1291
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Why would you just be sitting there or something?

1292
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Wouldn't you be active?

1293
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
You're camped outside the store, remember?

1294
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Not for Paper Mario, for Pac-Man Rally thing or whatever it was called.

1295
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,000
While you're enjoying Pac-Man Rally, wait for Paper Mario.

1296
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
I guess, okay.

1297
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I guess you can get 35 pounds that way.

1298
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Now, what is much more important that is on the Nintendo DS on September 14th over in

1299
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Europe is freshly picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland is finally coming out.

1300
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Loki, will you be importing it?

1301
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Because the great news is the DS is region-free.

1302
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Even though there's no plans to release this game in the US yet, you can actually import

1303
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
this game still for probably about, I think I saw it listed somewhere for about 45 bucks

1304
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
if you want to get Tingle.

1305
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
A waste of 45 dollars.

1306
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Why not?

1307
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Why won't you buy this game, Matt?

1308
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Why the hate for Tingle?

1309
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Because I don't like Tingle.

1310
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I think Tingle's a stupid character.

1311
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I didn't like him in Wind Waker.

1312
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Why the hell would I like him now?

1313
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Now that he has his own game?

1314
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I wonder if the game is any good.

1315
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I haven't heard anything about it.

1316
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
I don't bet he's going to be in fucking Smash Brothers Brawl.

1317
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
As a playable character?

1318
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
And then I'll never hear the fucking end of it.

1319
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Tingle's in fucking Smash Brothers.

1320
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Check it out.

1321
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I don't think he'll be in it.

1322
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I don't remember how that got started, associating Loki with Tingle.

1323
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
It's because I did his voice once.

1324
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And ever since then, it's just never-ending.

1325
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It would be really weird to have him in it, though, because they're using all the Zelda

1326
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
things.

1327
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Oh!

1328
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Do Tingle's voice.

1329
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
That'd be awesome.

1330
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
They're using the Zelda things from Twilight Princess, and even though I didn't beat the

1331
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
game, I never saw Tingle there.

1332
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Yeah, but he was in Wind Waker, and I think he was in one of the Nintendo 64 ones.

1333
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
He was in a crappy one, Majora's Mask.

1334
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
But they've already covered Wind Waker and all that stuff, I thought, in the last game.

1335
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,000
But if they're giving him his own game, they also fucking took Balloon Fight, and made

1336
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
his own version of that.

1337
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Come on.

1338
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I'm just not-

1339
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It's quirky and weird in Japanese.

1340
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I hate the Japanese.

1341
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
GS68 is in chat and says, Tingle, as the Super Smash Brothers Brawl character, will Loki

1342
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
get shot?

1343
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Wonder Dog Harold has a suggestion, Loki should just say he likes Tingle, and then no one

1344
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
would bring up Tingle ever again.

1345
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I don't like Tingle, though, that's the thing.

1346
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I think he's a stupid character.

1347
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
All right, it's done.

1348
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
We're beating a dead horse here, seriously.

1349
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Okay, let's go on and go to break.

1350
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
We're gonna go to break, and when we come back from break, we're gonna get into some

1351
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
more information on Part B, including some news about the Xbox 360.

1352
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Sounds pretty exciting.

1353
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Yeah, the ultra-secret announcement for next week, or this week, I should say.

1354
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Okay, we'll get into that very soon, as well as talking about some game delays, that's

1355
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
always fun.

1356
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And Shane is gonna read tonight's mailbag.

1357
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Totally.

1358
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
That should be interesting, to say the least.

1359
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Watch out, because I might make fun of you.

1360
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:39,000
All right, so we'll be back in just a moment with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
