Tonight, August 19th, 2007, the Wii and the 360 are the same price in one country, Guitar Hero 3 gets a little poison, and is a Wii Mode coming to the PlayStation 2?
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-host, DarkSakura.
Hi.
How are you doing, Miss Jamie Summers?
I'm here.
You're here?
You're alive and well?
Yes, quite.
All is good in the hood?
And not hungover.
Yes.
I got to watch DarkSakura get drunk last night.
I'll drink everybody.
and No Hangover.
No Hangover.
Amazing.
Do you remember what you drank?
Can you run down real quick?
Yes, I can.
I had a shot of cold sake.
I had 28 ounces of Kirin beer.
I had six martinis, two of them being palm tinis, one key lime pie and Adam and Eve because it was very tasty.
It was apple.
I had...
A guavatini, I had, what was that?
Oh God, I can't remember the first one.
The chocolate martini.
And then I had a shot of Glenlivet scotch.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hello!
Who did not join us last night.
No, I did not.
Alright, that's alright.
You weren't invited, because it was a bachelorette party, so straight men don't get to go to bachelorette parties, unfortunately.
Rob went to mine.
But he's not a straight man.
Yeah, exactly.
I know, I was saying you went to mine.
I invited you.
By the way, my boyfriend got very, very drunk last night, and Jamie definitely outdrank him.
I'm like next to nothing.
Anyway...
Nobody cares.
They want to hear the video game chat.
Loki, what did you do last night?
Maybe it was something gaming related.
No.
Instead, I went and saw the movie Superbad, and it was awesome.
Was it good?
I don't know.
I loved it.
I haven't seen, like, I think I saw, like, three-fourths of The 40-Year-Old Virgin.
I just never finished it, and then I didn't see that knocked up.
I wouldn't even compare it to it.
It's not even anything like that.
It's more like...
American Pie, but less retarded.
If you've ever seen Knocked Up... We should put that on the poster.
It's American Pie, but less retarded.
Well, if you've seen Knocked Up, it kind of has that same vibe to it.
I mean, there's a lot of crude jokes and stuff like that, but it's still very... You don't go into it like... There's no real gross-out moments or anything like that.
It's just kind of...
You can relate to it, I guess.
This is like freshman year type American Pie?
Jaded says no, we don't want to hear the video game chat.
We want to hear the drunken people chat.
Well, I don't know.
Some of our podcast subscribers might disagree with you, so we will get to game chat very soon.
But, you know, I mean, you can read about the news pretty much anywhere on the Internet, but we like to put our personal touch on things and hear from you guys.
That's why we always invite you guys to chat.orangelongeradio.com.
RossDLUT says, crude jokes does not equal good comedy.
And Sephiroth1215 says, Superbad was okay.
I was laughing the whole time.
There you go.
And especially, you know, there's a whole... I don't want to ruin it, but there's a part where you find out that one of the characters had a really bad habit when he was growing up, and it had to do with doodling things, and...
That part, it's super funny when they show it, and after the credits, there's more of that stuff, and it's hilarious.
Okay, I'll take your word for it.
Now, okay, so to bring things back to video games, and we transition to How Was Your Gaming Week, could there be a super bad video game?
Because, you know, as movies do very good, sometimes they get turned into video games.
I hope not.
There's a Napoleon Dynamite game coming out.
I was just thinking, I was like, you know, speaking of things that jumped the shark, I'm really surprised there's not a Napoleon Dynamite game.
No, there is.
Really?
DS and PSP, it looks stupid.
Horrible.
Sweet.
It's like, I mean, it's not even coming out remotely.
It's not like an anniversary of that movie or anything like that.
It's just, oh, by the way, we decided, you know, let's make a movie for this or a game for this that's, you know, years after the movie.
If there's one thing... Gosh.
If there's one thing I really hate, it is video games based on shitty movies that shouldn't be turned into video games.
They should do Xanadu, the game.
Now, that might be okay, actually.
It has to be all animated by Don Bluth.
Because sometimes when movies are so bad, they're kind of good.
Like, Showgirls, the game, I'd buy that.
There's a Betty Boop game coming out in fucking October.
It's like, come on!
Seriously, you missed the boat a long time ago with that.
Aren't we past the 1930s, Hive?
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
I beat the first area, the first town.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, I'll give you that.
I don't know.
I still have a soft spot for four, but I think that's just because that was my first one.
Yes, and you spoonied Bard.
But anyway.
But, but, but, but, but, but, but.
I touched it today.
What?
Final Fantasy VI?
No.
What?
Super Metroid.
Ah.
I picked up my Super Nintendo today and was going to pack it up and bring it over here, and then Dan informed me, oh, we're lending that to Adam.
Thank God you got it as a second guess, because the third guess wasn't much better for me.
Hey!
For the record, I do own Kirby's Avalanche.
So there.
All right.
And I was just saying, Super Metroid comes out on Virtual Console next week, but you were like, shh.
No.
That was exactly the noise you made when I said it was coming out on Virtual Console.
You were like, shh.
No.
We're playing the real one.
Even though the emulation on Wii is pretty good.
We're playing the real one.
We're going to play the real one.
Jamie and I failed.
Either that, or I have to see if my HoriPad will work.
We failed to have our Super Metroid night, but we are going to have it soon.
We've...
Go to your local flea market and pay $5
I'm just going to chat and reading some stuff here.
Son of Dad is talking about movie-based games.
Remember the Nacho Libre game?
No.
Yes, unfortunately I did.
Thankfully I don't.
I don't think I played that.
That was on the DS.
Well, there's, like, what other crap's coming up?
Arctic Tail, which, for those who may not know, Arctic Tail is going to be a brand new movie, kind of like March of the Penguins, except with polar bears and, like, seals.
Or what was the other one they had?
Happy Feet.
Happy Feet sucked.
Yeah.
The movie was okay, but at least Happy Feet was not a documentary, though.
It was, you know, there was singing and dancing in there, so you can kind of, you know, turn that into a pretty good game, I guess.
TigerClaw says, Sky, what about the Alvin and Chipmunk games?
It's going to be kind of like Guitar Hero.
Yeah, but Alvin and Chipmunk, so that's another movie tie-in game for, you know, it's going to be crap.
Here's the thing, like, the new Alvin and the Chipmunks makes me want to throw up in my mouth, okay?
Like, when I saw the poster and everything, it looks like crap.
and I just never liked the original to begin with, to be honest.
That's not one thing from my childhood I fondly remember.
I think they were kind of stupid.
Jason Lee is such a sellout now.
Seriously, what the fuck happened since the VSQ days?
I liked My Name is Earl.
Okay, I don't like that show, but credit to that at least, that's a little different.
But come on, I mean, seriously, the Alvin Chipmunk shit, I mean... Alright, now we're getting back into movie podcasting.
Let's get back to the games.
Was there anything else you wanted to share?
My name is Earl of the TV show, and the only reason I saw that is because you were there, they were watching it at my Fourth of July party.
The only game that I think this year that's going to be any good that's tied in with sort of a movie, and it's not even really based on a movie, The Simpsons game.
is going to be fucking awesome.
That is it.
I prefer playing the actual game on the actual, that's just how I've always been.
But there is a good point to emulation.
Translated Japanese RPGs.
Seiken Densetsu 3.
The quintessential translated game you must play.
Where they went and translated the graphics in the game.
Or Final Fantasy V before Square brought it over here.
That was the other biggie.
I had a very, very well translated, or even, I had a translated Panorama Cotton once.
Hmm.
And the Ninja Pass!
All right, anything else you want to share for your gaming week?
No.
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
I tried to play as much as possible.
I played Casserone a little bit, the demo for that, and it's pretty interesting, actually.
I could kind of get into it, you know, because I know Nelly's been hooked on Catan, and I had to literally drag the 360 to a different room.
So that I could actually play some games on it.
So that was pretty cool.
And then, of course, the one demo everyone's been playing this week would be Bioshock.
And I tried that, and it's awesome.
So awesome that I decided to pre-order my game after I played it.
And then, let's see here.
Also played some more Beautiful Katamari.
All three minutes of it.
And then...
I played Overlord some more, and that's actually been pretty fun.
I was pretty surprised.
I thought I'd get tired of the game pretty quick and kind of hesitated to purchase it originally, but I'm actually very satisfied with the game.
It's pretty fun, and it's really the game itself.
You try to be good in it, and I think it's harder to be good in the game than evil, but after a while, the NPCs just really piss you off, and you just go and decide to kill everybody, and that's the way you should do it, I think.
Other than that, I played me and my Katamari on the PSP and tried to remind myself why I hated it on the PSP in the first place, and that would be the controls.
They suck balls without having a second analog stick on there.
And then, of course, Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, because for some reason we're a glutton for punishment with that game.
It's
I don't know how this is fucking possible, but the game actually glitches in new ways.
It just progressively evolves into a worse game.
And I don't know why.
It's just weird.
It's like a guy's own conscience or something.
It just fucking gets worse, and I don't know how.
But it does.
And yet we'll still play it until they release another fucking Grand Theft Auto game that has multiplayer.
I think that's all I played.
Oh, I played Track and Field.
Hated it.
You didn't like it?
No, didn't care for it.
For me, it's dumb fun.
I mean, it's totally a brainless type of game, Track and Field.
I still haven't bought the full retail one, but I've played the old school one on the computer.
I know it was in the arcade at one time.
Yeah, it was.
I remember playing an arcade one a long time ago.
They should remake it into the arcade with a DDR pad type thing.
I think that would be a little bit more...
put it in like sports bars or something Konami has both yeah uh my gaming week um you know not a lot of new stuff to try out this week you know obviously there's Madden but sports games are typically not my cup of tea so I passed on that um so just kind of playing the old stuff World of Warcraft, Boom Boom Rocket oh yeah I played that too what Boom Boom Rocket or World of Warcraft how'd that go for you you were here oh yeah that's right der anyway um let's see what else I play um
Echo the Dolphin, I downloaded and tried out on Xbox Live, and I have to admit, I thought the game was overrated when I first played it.
Many years ago, I think it's overrated now.
I'm not a fan of the Echo series.
I never understood why people love that so much.
You're breaking my heart.
They need Calibri.
I'm sorry.
I didn't like Calibri either.
I played Hexic 2 just to see maybe if the sequel was any better than the first one because I didn't really care for the first one too much.
The first one's kind of fun.
I found the second one to be easier, actually.
It was weird.
Really?
That's a good thing because the first one is really hard.
Yeah, I was able to create a lot of, I don't remember what they are, but basically create some sort of ring thing and it turns into something else.
I don't know.
Yeah, you can probably play a lot of that game.
I don't like that it's not free, though.
That's the only thing.
There's actually something I do need to mention that someone reminded me in the chat room.
We did have an instance of the M word in my house as I left.
What, Madden?
The M word.
Oh, fuck.
DarkSakura.com
Let's see.
Now, DarkSakura, your heart is going to break a little more based on chat comments here.
Gold Banjo says, Echo the Dolphin isn't even worth an emulation download.
Yeah, your mom!
Sephiroth1215 says, I didn't like Echo, but I really liked the Tides of Time.
Tides of Time was great.
RawSteelUT says, Echo would be good if it weren't harder than real-life nuclear warfare.
It wasn't that hard.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I mean, that's the only thing I can think that make that game any better.
Alright, so I instead played demos.
And here's the thing, like, Bioshock, okay?
Like, I was not getting excited about Bioshock at all.
I'm just like, oh hooray, it's another first person shooter, looks all sci-fi, doesn't really look like a game I want to get into.
In fact, I even went and I posted on my Twitter, because I have a lot of gaming people that I know on Twitter,
and other independent podcast people, among other things.
And I actually made a post on Twitter that said something about like, so what's the big deal?
Oh, here it is.
So what's so awesome about Bioshock?
I'm not knocking it.
I'm just curious because usually I don't get too excited for first-person shooters.
and then GamerAndy replied to me and said, frankly, it's the immersive environment jam-packed with atmosphere and the story.
Irrational makes good games.
And then I'm reading all these reviews like, what, it has like a 99 on Metacritic?
I'm like, okay, I gotta see what's so frippin' fabulous about this game, right?
So I downloaded the demo.
Oh my god, it really is that good.
Like, if the demo is any sign of what the game is gonna be...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Looked at the fire and the water and I stood there and stared at it for like 30 seconds.
My other friend that played it too, he's just like looking at it like, damn, that looks really good.
The graphics in this game are hands down like, you know, and I really don't like reviewing a game based on the demo.
So let me say that up front.
But I think especially in this day and age, you can use a demo as a pretty good sign of what's to come for the game.
I don't think I've seen a better looking game, period.
I mean, the game looks like phenomenal.
It's amazing.
And it was scary.
I don't know though if I'll end up actually buying the full retail version just because I'm so horrible at first person shooters.
I am so bad at them.
I am too, but you know what?
I wouldn't be able to play it.
I purchased it.
I had to get the limited edition so I can get the big daddy for my desk at work.
Bioshock Bioshock
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So the game looks, I mean, it really, I mean, usually there's a part of me that wants to go, oh, it can't be that good.
It can't be that good.
Why is everybody praising this game?
It really, like, you really have to try it, like, seriously.
Anyway, going to chat room here.
Darvoid says, Bioshock demo is fun.
ChainsawJuggling says it's the best game ever.
I can't wait till Tuesday.
Sounds like they're going to have a hit on their hands there.
So, Joshi16 says, damn, I want my Bioshock.
Interesting.
Thanks for watching!
in pretty HD graphics.
And you're right.
The sad thing is, I think there's a part of me that doesn't care either.
I'll probably end up buying the damn game, despite all the drama that happened on this program because of that game.
I don't know.
It is still somewhat addicting, and I'm looking forward to multiplayer.
But I still kind of look at it with shifty eyes going, did you have to reuse the same frickin' song on the title screen?
and kind of the same gag over and over.
I don't know.
I'd like to see something a little bit different, but I'm hoping some of the new modes will make me feel a little bit better about things.
So that was that.
Otherwise, it was a three-minute demo.
I can't really tell a lot off of that.
Darvoid says, it better not be $60 Katamari.
No, it's like, I think, $30 or $40.
It's like cheap.
That's good.
NintendoManiac64 says, so Sky, is Bioshock the Ocarina of Time of first-person shooters?
Again, I don't want to base my entire opinion of a game off a demo.
Um, but it damn well could be based off of the early reviews.
Oh, Green Time wasn't that great of a game anyways, and I still don't know what everyone's, I still don't know what the hell everyone's big deal is with that game.
Yeah, in the Zelda universe, the Super Nintendo Link to the Past will always be the best one to make.
Oh, yeah.
Always be the best one.
Always.
Always, Jamie, always.
You sound like a Maxi Pet commercial, Rob.
I hate you.
You don't.
Housekeeping.
Let's do some housekeeping tonight.
Okay, the only housekeeping we really have tonight is going to affect the live listeners.
We just found out literally five minutes before we went live tonight.
We found out five minutes before we went live.
Live 365 is shutting down at 8 p.m.
tonight.
So that's going to screw some of you live listeners out of some of the perks of listening live, and we apologize.
Like the bonus segment we do in between and the afterbirth just because of the maintenance.
We're going to try and cram all the show in before 8 p.m.,
We're going to rearrange Skype line a little bit too and do it in the beginning of Part B tonight and not at the end of Part B as we usually do.
And we're going to cut out a few segments as well like the mailbag just because we got one email this whole week.
So we're going to roll it over to next week.
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
We'd love to hear from you, your comments on the story.
Do you think Bioshock is all that?
I want to hear from people that played the Bioshock demo and didn't like it.
Like, please speak up, because I always love to hear devil's advocate perspectives.
So, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
And the language of the week I want to email in is Italian, even though I can't read Italian for shit.
Be quiet.
I can still read French.
Alright, so sorry you guys about the downtime tonight.
There's nothing we can really do about it.
We're going to try and finish the show before 8, but we'll see.
And I wanted to mention, though, podcast awards, they're over, you know,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and we've always said if we can't win it ourselves it's best another independent podcast win it and another one did so there you go good job and they've had a lot of like success this year too and a lot of drama with the whole like what that lawsuit or no not one lawsuit subpoena the subpoena against them and everything try to get the Circuit City ad foreign members it's been a fun year
to be a CagCast listener.
So, good job for those guys.
You know, they're actually up for two awards.
I'd like to see them win the other one they were nominated for, but they don't find out about the other one until the actual awards ceremony.
Well, if any of them are listening, let me just tell you this much, and I think I can speak for Jamie on this.
The award show is kind of lame.
Yes, it is.
It could have gotten better.
They do have good nibbly food.
And I was about...
I would have to say by a distance of a foot and a half, I level with Adam Curry's butt.
I'm not joking.
And I couldn't really appreciate it properly because, you know, he doesn't really have a nice butt and I had the flu.
Alright, please can we get into game chat now?
Because I do not want to turn this into the Adam Curry's butt podcast.
But I will turn it into the Bioshock podcast because I'll be damned if the internet isn't abuzz about the game this week.
So I got a quick story on Bioshock.
Thanks for watching!
before people can buy them.
And apparently some Toys R Us has just made a big boo-boo and sold the game.
All the more reason not to ship them early.
So tons of people are getting this game early.
It's not just Toys R Us, but people I know that do other podcasts that for some reason get free games sent to them, even though we've never... No, I take that back.
We got a couple.
But we didn't get this one.
There's only one company that loves us.
Lots of Bioshock.
Lots of Bioshock copies floating around out there.
And of course, tens million more come Tuesday.
So there you go.
DJ Dark Knight says, huge fine.
I don't know, what do you think, Loki?
Do you think Toys R Us would get a fine over this?
I don't think so.
What they'll do is, I don't think it's Toys R Us, you know, store, like it's not chain wide, it's just, I think it was one or two stores in Jersey that were doing it.
A couple sloppy managers.
And it's just, you know, it's some idiot, and what they'll do is they'll try to track it down based on the receipts and stuff, and, you know, someone will get in trouble there, and that's about it.
You know, as long as it's not, you know, corporate wide or something, they're
It's not going to be a huge deal.
They may just get their next game or whatever shipped to them.
They won't get it before street date.
A little slap on the wrist.
Naughty, naughty.
No cookie.
Yeah, because there's Target and shit.
Target and Walmart are horrible.
Toys R Us is usually the biggest offender when it comes to breaking street date.
Funny you guys say that.
Son of Dad says, for once, it's not Target breaking massive street dates.
Joshi16 says, I would laugh if OLR got a free Madden.
Hey, you know what?
Please, send me one, because... I would laugh if we did too, because EA's pretty... Why not give it a fair shot, and give the game a fair shot?
I'm not going to hold a grudge against it just because it's a sports game.
It deserves a fair shot just like any other game.
Hey, I'm not saying it's a horrible game either.
I'm just saying I don't care for sports games.
Any sports games.
Alright, anyway, moving on.
So, if you don't have your hands on Bioshock yet, you still can get your hands on the art book, which is free to download from Irrational Games.
And, um...
BioShock Breaking the Mold Artbooks are great
Now, speaking, though, of computer-y stuff, you know, they were saying, well, at least IGN PC reviewed PC Bioshock as much better than the Xbox 360 version, saying that it handled better, the interface was better by using the mouse and the keyboard, which, if you're playing a first-person shooter, hi, duh.
Well, now, wait a minute.
Except, except, except.
I think, you know, it's personal preferences, I think.
Yeah, here's the classic debate, keyboard and mouse versus analog sticks.
I mean...
Depending on how the game was supposed to be played, the functionality of the game itself... Like, okay, what would you rather play Doom on?
PC or...
Okay, I read their review on Bioshock, and their thing was, they're saying, you know, for example, switching your special abilities using the right mouse button instead of the left bumper on the 360.
To be honest, I don't have trouble hitting the left bumper on the 360.
It's not hard.
I just don't get it.
It's just nitpicking shit, is what it is.
And they're also saying the hacking's a little bit easier because you can use the mouse instead of having to use the analog stick.
I mean, mine...
minor shit.
That's all it is.
Well, they were also pointing out, though, that you could run it at 1920x1200.
Well, I'm sure you can do it.
If you've got a PC, hi.
If you have an Uber computer that's fast enough.
I bet if I tried to run it at that resolution, it wouldn't be smooth.
That's the other problem.
I mean, but that's, you know, PC gaming in general.
You usually have to have, like, the most top-end system to play most of the newer games.
Not all.
Like, you know, games like World of Warcraft can run on pretty old machines, but, you know.
But it's meant to be available to a high audience.
I'd try it out on PC I don't know though I'm so used to those type of games now with the analogs I don't know but yeah like Quake 3 I couldn't not play that on a PC like you know there's just some games you really get used to
and if we want to go the other way around, Final Fantasy XI.
Well, yeah, we did have that issue, didn't we?
Yeah, Final Fantasy XI was made for a console.
It was made for the PlayStation 2, ported to the PC.
I can't fucking play that game with a controller for shit.
I have to have the keyboard to play that game.
But I had absolutely no problem playing it with a controller.
I started off with that crappy little Gravis pad I got for $10 from Dan's GameStop back in the day.
And I was doing all my macros and crap with my trigger buttons.
You know what?
Your wiring is backwards, I think.
What?
The games you're supposed to play with a controller, you like to play with keyboard and mouse.
The games you're supposed to play with keyboard and mouse, you like with controller.
You're backwards.
No, I'm not.
That's what it is.
Yes, you are.
That, and you know, it's kind of hard to play Doom without a keyboard because of, you know, IDDQD and IDBFG and all that.
All right.
Uh, let's see, looking at, uh, chat room for comments, uh, chat.orangelandradio.com Sephiroth1215 says, uh, FPS games are usually done in the USA, and US companies love to have the best graphics possible, and that's not possible on Wii.
Let's start a little debate there about, I'm sure Metroid Prime 3 is coming into the mix as well now, because that game's out, what, next week as well?
Or no, two weeks?
Two weeks.
Yeah.
Uh, let's see.
What else is there here?
Um...
I guess Dark Tetsuya maybe talked about that.
I wish they'd make Red Steel 2, even though they have so much room for improvement.
Lots of room for improvement.
Let's see.
Yeah, RawSteelUT says it probably costs three times as much to get a system that'll run Bioshock.
XBOX LIVE ARCADE
Every month following the launch.
So, kind of not surprising when you consider that Microsoft's been trying to bridge the gap between the console and the PC.
But, I don't know.
I don't know if I'd buy a lot of these for PC.
But my question is, if I bought it on live, would I get to download it for free on the PC?
I think I should.
Maybe you should, too.
Of course, I'm cheap.
The other thing, too, I'm wondering, is it's going to be a little bit of a harder sell to sell some of these PopCab games that are free online.
on the PC.
Yeah, but even PopCap charges extra money for a downloadable version with more features.
That's where they make their money.
Because whenever you play one of those games online, they're always saying, download the trial version of the Uber version of this game with more levels and more colors.
Woo!
And all that.
I think what's also interesting about the whole thing is that the 150 megabyte size limit still applies, even to the PC games.
That's kind of interesting to me.
I don't know.
Well... I don't know.
Anyways...
Maybe, well, actually the 150 meg limit, maybe that does tie into something that they're going to be able to be transferred back and forth or something.
I don't know.
I would hope so.
Maybe later on or something.
Um, okay.
So, and this is not a big surprise, but apparently the news got out that, um, Xbox or Microsoft, I should say, is allowing certain MMOs to require, um, hard drive space, um,
and require the use of the Xbox 360 hard drive.
Duh, I mean, Final Fantasy XI, hello, I mean.
But apparently what they're saying is that each title will create a master storage file, one file per title per console or something like that.
And apparently on the box it will say, you know, such and such storage is required.
Even though XI didn't say that, did it?
Well, I guess it had to have said it somewhere.
It must have because you had to install it to your hard drive, so.
I don't know.
I'm not surprised that MMOs require this.
I'm just surprised that normal games haven't gotten this yet.
I still think that that is coming, whether they're saying it or not.
The most shocking thing about that story to me, I was like, there's MMOs in development for the 360?
Awesome.
Wasn't there that Marvel MMO or something that was coming out to them?
That would be awesome.
I'll play that.
I don't remember that.
I'm like, what MMOs are in development for 360?
I'm just totally spacing it.
I know I've heard of something, but I can't remember.
Like, what is in development for 360 that's an MMO?
Well, I don't know.
People... Do they still play Phantasy Star Universe?
Oh my god, World of Warcraft.
It must be true.
World of Warcraft is coming to 360.
Oh, shut up!
World of Warcraft is never coming to 360.
Leave it on the damn PC.
Ragnarok 2.
Now that would be sweet.
I have to have a Korean social security number, apparently.
Sucks.
Well, no, there's ways of getting around it, but I've been trying to play the Ragnarok 2 demo.
You're going to have to kidnap a Korean child.
There's other ways to do that.
I don't want a Korean child.
Oh, DJ Dark Knight has a good point.
A fancy star universe is also another MMO on the 360.
That's what I just said.
In fact, the add-on comes out this fall for it, if people are still playing that game.
Guess who quit?
DarkTetsuya says find at
Did you hear about the baby this week?
That's not in Korea.
No, that was China.
That's China.
Get your countries right.
Get your Asia right, Dark Tetsuya.
Shame.
God, really?
That was still kind of funny.
A little funny.
Even if it was wrong, it was funny.
I know.
You know what?
Read the news, people.
Go on Yahoo.
Instead of reading about celebrities and Paris Hilton's stupid ass, read World News.
But what if I like to read about celebrities?
It's like...
Perez Hilton is like in my day.
Like I always visit, okay, you gotta visit Kotaku and Destructoid and Joystick and Perez Hilton.
That's basically how I, you know.
Okay.
Surf the net every day.
I go to Yahoo News and then I go to CNN.com and then I read my live journal.
No one cares about a browsing habit.
Let's go to the next story.
And then I go to PornoTube.
Well, while Steel UT apparently needs an explanation, some people in China wanted to name their child at...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
My Chemical Romance is going to be in Guitar Hero 3.
They're doing a three-pack.
I'm sorry, not Guitar Hero 3, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360.
They are doing a three-song pack for Xbox Live Marketplace that will have teenagers' famous last words, and this is how I disappear.
It is 500 points, a.k.a.
$6.25.
And I believe it's actually up now.
They're master tracks, by the way, from the band.
And I believe we have a little clip of those songs.
So, cause, like, well, you know, cause, because, like, I have no idea who my, well, I know who they are, but I don't really listen to these type of bands.
They did one song that I like.
I don't.
That was Cemetery Drive.
Like, I knew none of these songs.
Play something, Rob.
Alright, let's do it.
Say, now, I'm straight as a star.
Don't leave no shit out of me.
Make you care less, that's wrong.
Hmm, the chatroom is all going, no, no, don't play that, why did you do that, why?
And Sephiroth1215, though, says, Hey, I hate emo, but the Black Parade is very good.
I don't know.
I thought the songs were kind of melodic.
They seem to fit in Guitar Hero 2.
I mean, I don't get into the whole emo versus punk versus whatever else.
I don't know.
At least you got some new fucking tracks to download for Guitar Hero 2 that are not Guitar Hero 1.
Amen.
There you go.
Can't we all agree that that's a good thing, even if you don't like the particular band they picked?
There you go.
Good job.
All right, well, speaking of Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 3 is going to be getting Slash.
You already knew about that, but they're also going to be having Bret Michaels, if you can believe it.
Bret Michaels is going to be using his face and his image in the game, just like Slash.
And then, of course, in the game, you've got to get some Poison songs, Talk Dirty to Me by Poison, and go that far from the Bret Michaels band.
So pretty cool.
You can look forward to those songs in Guitar Hero 3.
Unfortunately, we do not have clips of those songs because I was too lazy to prearrange that before the show.
Well, way to go, Rob.
My bad.
Anyways, if you happen to be living in Australia, you'll be happy to know that the 360 Core has now been price dropped to compete with the Wii.
It is now the same price as the Wii.
And, of course, coinciding with that, the 20 gig system has also been dropped down to...
$579.95 Australian.
So that's pretty awesome as well.
I don't know.
Dropping the core system down to where the Wii is, not good enough I still think.
Well, I don't know.
I think it's interesting precedent.
I wonder if that's going to happen over here eventually where the 360 will get cut back enough where it can compete with the Wii like that.
I think it's also a matter of the markets themselves that want to make it competitive for the market it's in.
Or is it just that Nintendo kind of likes to screw the people that aren't in Japan or the U.S.
by charging more for their systems?
Because, you know, doesn't the DS and the Wii cost way more?
I guess most systems cost way more in Europe and Australia, Canada.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
But it still creates an interesting choice when they are the same price in that currency, the Wii and the 360.
It's kind of a different competition than it is here in that regard.
But at the same time, if you want to argue it, I guess, that you would need to still buy a memory card in order to be able to save your games and stuff versus the Wii, which has built-in memory, although it is extremely limited.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
for anyone who has been keeping up with Sega there was a rumor going around that they were doing a Viking game called Vikings Battle of Asgard and GameStop has actually stopped listing the PS3 and Xbox 360 version of that on their forthcoming games and um
It was to be released in February 2008, but Sega's not saying anything about it.
I mean, they could say something when it comes up to the convention coming up, but other than that, they're... Nuh-uh.
Huh.
No hairy Vikings!
No fjords!
Wasn't there an old-school PC game called Vikings or something like that?
Or what was... I think it was something else.
Like the Lost Vikings or something?
Yeah, the Lost Vikings.
Is that what it was?
I think they also had a version of Super Nintendo, didn't they?
They're porting it, yeah.
Is Crazy Frog Racer already out on PC or something?
It's in the UK.
Oh my lord.
Crazy Frog is like one of those franchises that really needs to go away.
Well, anyway, look, folks, it's Graffiti is the company that's working on it, and the CEO of Graffiti, Kenneth Hurley, actually said this at a recent announcement.
Quote, we are excited to jump in on the Xbox 360 and introduce our title to the millions of gamers around the world playing on the console.
But maybe no one wants to play your damn game.
Everything about that?
Oh god, the soundtrack alone is going to make me want to put a gun to my head.
I don't get that Crazy Frog thing at all.
Have you heard the Crazy Frog songs, Jamie?
I don't know.
Please have a clip.
I will get a clip.
I will load a clip right now.
While you do the next story.
Do the next story and I will get a clip.
Alright, well, you may be waiting for Beautiful Katamari to come out in October, but
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So you can actually play as one of the cousins in the demo as well Yay, that's kind of neat Yeah, we actually have a clip of one of the new songs from Beautiful Katamari right here
You know, if my Xbox... That was Crazy Frog, by the way.
If my Xbox started making those type of noises, three Red Rings of Death wouldn't be enough.
For what I would do to it.
Well, you know, let's cleanse the palette a little bit away from retarded frog.
Okay.
Smacky the frog.
Anyway.
For people who are still playing Lost Planets, guess what?
The maps are all free.
You can just go get them.
I like free.
Um...
They're free.
What else is there to say?
Free stuff.
Go get it.
Yay, free.
I like that whole concept, though, of releasing map packs in advance for money for the hardcore people and then free for the rest of us.
Apparently, according to this, you can trade in your game and rebuy it for $10 at Toys R Us.
What?
Look at what this says.
It says you can rebuy it at Toys R Us for $9.99.
Why the fuck would you trade in your game and then re-buy it for $10?
It's a profit-making thing, I think.
I think they're saying you can sell it back for more and then buy it for cheap.
It's a money-making scheme.
Whatever.
I think that's with Madden.
What it is is the game is like $20 right now.
Joshi16 says Crazy Frog Frogger would be good.
Kill him.
They actually have Crazy Frog Racing coming out on PlayStation 2 in two weeks, actually.
Kill me now.
Maybe it'll coincide with the Xbox 360 game.
I mean, have you ever heard shittier music in your life?
I mean, really?
Like, does this make you want to go and, like, willingly listen to Britney Spears?
It makes me want to go on a car trip with you.
Hey, I've heard some of the stuff you play in your car.
I disagree with some of it.
Let's change the subject.
Our chat room's in pain, and I'm sure many of you are too.
So let's talk about release dates.
That's always a happy subject that will wake us back up and get us all happy again.
Shari Takoran
which looks to be some type of game where I don't know it looks like it's another it's by Compile Heart and this you know of course anime looking chick is offering up these little octopus looking cute things I don't really know how else to describe it it's a puzzle game though Tentacle Rape?
Suku Suku in Fuku 2
Motosukusuku is coming out.
Shut up, that's what it's called.
Okay, are there girls in like Suku Suku uniforms there?
Now, I like, check out this screenshot from PureXCure, Loki.
It looks like she wants a Suku Suku in the Ufuku.
She's showing a little bit of skirt there, hiking up a little bit.
Okay.
Okay.
Fuck PurexCure, I don't care about that.
I want to see what this Suku Suku thing is here.
It's a quiz game, though!
Quiz and variety.
I guess it's these cute little chibi bunny things.
Some are dressed as a knight, and some are dressed as little farms guys.
I guess that's Suku and that's Fuku, I don't know.
They're more descriptive terms, because Motto is more...
also coming out on the Nintendo DS Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fates and I'm sure a lot of you guys like your Crystal Chronicles so there you go, you have that to look forward to and that's probably the biggest game this week that and Suku Suku awesome anyways, let's see
in the U.S.
Um, there's some pretty good stuff to look forward to this week.
Uh, just a little game called Bioshock on, um, PlayStation 2, or, not PlayStation 2, 360 and PC.
I meant PC for some reason I was looking at a PlayStation 2 game.
OMG, Bioshock's coming to PlayStation 3 after all.
OMG, OMG.
Oh my god, no.
It is not coming to PlayStation 2.
PlayStation 2 would melt down if they had to play that game.
Um,
On PlayStation 2, though, you can look forward to two wonderful games, including Metropolis Mania 2 and Brunswick Bowling.
Awesome.
Hooray.
On PS3 and PSP, you're going to be getting Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, the delayed edition.
Then, let's see, also...
Let's see here, on PC and 360 as well, another good RPG, Two Worlds, coming out on both platforms, as well as the Two Worlds Collector's Edition.
And let's see, on PSP, a couple more games, Jeanne d'Arc and Dragon Ears Aria is also making its way up.
On the Wii, a whole bunch of nothing And of course on the DS, Brain Age 2, more brain training in minutes a day Another game that you'll play for one whole day and then stop playing And this one was really interesting, The Settlers is coming out on DS as well Which isn't that Settlers of Catan, I think?
The Settlers?
Sounds familiar
I don't know.
I'll have to look at that.
And then Operation Vietnam.
So you too can have the flashbacks that everybody is jealous of.
All right.
Real quick before we get to the Europe dates, I just want to say in chat, Darvoid says that Sukufuku translates to summer uniform, despite what you were thinking, sicko.
That does look like a summer uniform.
Summer is not too.
Well, whatever.
Let's just move on.
Anyway.
On the 21st, we have Dragoneer's Aria on PSP.
On the 24th, we have Anno 1701 for the DS.
Blue Dragon on Xbox 360.
Glory Days 2, Brotherhood of Men on DS.
We have Loki on PC.
A bunch of Madden.
Fuck Madden.
MotoGP07 Sucks It's the husband No, I detest American football It's stupid Play rugby Is Loki coming to Mac?
No, it's PC That's right, Loki does not come to Mac I knew that was coming Can I continue?
Yes, you may Thank you, sir On the 24th we have Pac-Man Rally
24th also is Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 for PS3 and PSP.
And 24th is Bioshock.
No, Bioshock.
Are you going to hate that too?
No.
If they did a PS2 version, you'd think it'd be like BioFizz.
BioZap.
Alright.
I hope Mr. Bubbles gets a spin-off game.
That's all I hope for.
He should have his own Saturday morning cartoon show.
Mr. Bubbles Happy Hour!
There should be a fighting game, Mr. Bubbles vs. Pyramid Head.
Pyramid Head would win.
That would be hardcore.
Pyramid Head.
They need to do, like, scary games of the fighter.
In a fight, though, between Mr. Bubbles, or, you know, the Big Daddy and Pyramid Head.
Mr. Bubbles, Pyramid Head, and the Liquor.
I'm sorry, I would say, though, I think that, you know, seeing the demo, how fast those, you know, big daddies move, and Pyramid Head's just dragging that shit along.
I mean, he's kind of slow.
Yeah, but the only way you can kill Pyramid Head is for him to kill himself.
P-Hitty P-Hitty P-Hitty
It's P. Hetty.
Well, it was OLR versus AGI, right?
So it would be, like, you, me, and Loki are all playable characters, and Scott, Mary Young, and Jessica are all playable characters.
Then maybe, like, Bobby B for good measure, and we could put one of our people, like, Travis Donovan or DMN or somebody can be a playable character.
And then P. Hetty.
It's just random.
It just shows up.
Random boss.
He'd be, like, Noob Saibot.
He'd be Smoke.
All right, uh...
Moving on.
Chat room is very random here.
GS68 says, I want DarkSakura the game, which would more or less be Burnout OLR Edition.
You don't know how right you are.
You just totally see her driving down the freeway.
Let's see what else is there.
Joshi16 says, Bioshock on the Atari 2600.
That would be interesting.
Wipeout HD
It was already formally announced.
We know the game is coming.
It was already said that it was coming at E3 2007, and it's supposed to be released before the end of the year.
Wipeout HD, of course, will have high def.
It's Wipeout for the PlayStation 3.
What else do you need to know?
Why can't they just release a demo on the PlayStation Network since there's hardly any demos on there in the first place?
because people are really critical of demos and stuff and they probably want to make sure that, you know, because even though I said earlier I wasn't going to base my full opinion of a game off a demo, there's a lot of people that will.
And I'm not perfect either.
I've done it before.
So there you go.
Another interesting thing, apparently calling all cars is going to be transferable to the PSP.
At least that's the rumor.
Yeah.
And this is coming from a European magazine, PSP, the official guidebook.
And no word on if that's even true or not, but it would be interesting.
I don't know.
Maybe sell some more copies on PSP that way.
I don't know.
Is anyone interested in this game?
I know I looked at it and I was like, eh.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I've been ignoring it.
Alrighty then.
I mean, like, is it supposed to be exciting?
Um, well, the game itself, you know, basically is kind of a cops and robbers type thing.
It's all done, you know, cartoony, cel-shaded and stuff.
Yeah, wasn't that, wasn't actually that an old show?
No.
Oh, that was Car 54, Where Are You?
Yeah.
I think there was a show called Calling All Cars, but I think it has nothing to do with this, actually.
Oh.
I, I, I, I've,
I like the fact that it's transferable.
That's kind of a neat feature.
I mean, that's something that Xbox Live is never going to be able to really deliver because there is no portable Microsoft system yet.
But that's kind of neat.
I know.
Wait.
Well, for anybody else, though, who's interested in anything Sony has going on, there are going to be... They've actually got some dates released from 3 Speech for UK.
First coming out is Warhawk on the 28th of August on PSN, and 21st September release for Blu-ray.
And also...
It's going to cost £19.99 at €29.
It will be, let's see, there will be extra video content, a manual, and a Bluetooth headset if you pay the £39.99 to get it on the Blu-ray hard copy.
Heavenly Sword is going to be rumored as the 14th of September with Folklore and Lair on 12th and 26th October, of course, respective.
And that's nothing really yet said about SingStar for PS3.
Will you guys be getting Lair at your house, Jamie?
Because I really want to see that game.
We could get it.
I mean, we can rent whatever we want to.
Oh, that's cool.
Because I'm kind of, you know, I still haven't bought a PlayStation 3, but there are certain games I really would like to see that, you know, may change my opinion on PlayStation 3 and finally get one, and that's one of them.
I can't remember if I have Lair on order or not.
I think I'm getting, I know I'm getting Heavenly Sword.
Oh, yeah, that too.
And then Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of Destruction.
I think by Christmas I'll have finally caved and buy a PlayStation 3.
I think.
We'll see.
Longer you wait, the better a deal you're going to get.
That's true.
So I'm trying to hold out.
Well, also the fact that I just don't have a lot of money right now.
And just remember, all the good games you're looking forward to aren't coming out until next spring at least.
True.
True.
Anyways, I'll hold up.
Well, moving on, let's talk about free, because if I can't buy new consoles, then I'm going to get free stuff, because I like free stuff.
One thing that's now free is ArcLord.
If you are an MMO fan, hopefully you've heard of this game, but if you haven't, Codemasters Online Gaming has made its online RPG, ArcLord.
Completely free to play.
There's an all-new expansion also available for download.
The director of marketing at COG noted, quote, Since its release, Arc Lord has grown consistently, and we are excited to throw open the doors to players across North America and Europe looking to play a premium, 100% free MMORPG.
There's got to be a catch.
What's the catch?
There must be a catch.
I don't know what it is.
No one's playing it.
Is there ads or something?
It says, I'm looking at the official website here.
Zero Fees, download the free game now.
I might check it out just for shits and giggles.
I thought that was... Someone said that that was Overlord based off that game, and I don't think so, but... Possibly.
The name sounds familiar.
Yeah, it does have a very similarish name.
RossDLUT says, next week, ArcLord closes down.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Well, speaking of enjoying it while it lasts, yes, you may...
Be familiar with a wonderful spin-off into the porno world called World of Warcraft.
Well, guess what?
They've decided to move off of World of Warcraft and move into the ever-expanding realm of first-person shooters.
Yes, they have just created FPS porn.
Operation Sex, Cock and Load.
That is the actual fucking name of this thing.
It is a gaming-themed porn series, um,
That is, of course, based off of games like Counter-Strike, Ghost Recon, and Rainbow Six and involves a lot of people running around shooting fake guns and yelling stuff and sex.
Damn it.
That's the best combination ever.
That's a list list in the making we need to do next week.
Random things you should have in a porn game.
No, what video game should be turned into porn?
Oh.
Like Biocock.
Could be maybe an FPS that comes out in the future.
Cocking Mama.
Cocking Mama?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Mama will fix it, naughty boy.
Okay, I didn't say that.
Attention, Internet, DarkSakura would like to see CockingMama.
No!
Not me.
I was just thinking of names.
Looking at comments in the chat room, NintendoManiac64 says, FPS, First Person Sex?
No, it's not First Person Sex, because...
That's POV sex, by the way.
That's a whole different genre.
Just stop.
Just stop.
This is actually first person where they've got the gun and everything and they're firing the gun and they're reloading it just like you would see in a first person shooter game, except they stop and have sex every now and then.
They stop and reload.
Because when you're in the middle of terrorist warfare, you have to stop and have sex.
They have to reload.
This is so mature tonight.
Rosteel UT sticks his head in a meat grinder.
Yay!
Good job!
You got the guy who's always ragging on us, put his head in the meat grinder.
No, I'm just kidding.
ACHP said, Cocking Mama Cock Off.
Joshi16 says, Train your cock in minutes a day.
RastielUT says, Cooking Mama Bobbit.
Footy Mama Footy in Toronto says, Ninten Cats in itself is a sex game.
Ninten Pussy.
We are so mature.
and Tingle the RPG.
This show has sunk to the level of dick and fart jokes.
Congratulations, everybody.
Good job.
Hey, you ever remember X-Man and Custer's Revenge?
Of course I remember Custer's Revenge.
I haven't played X-Man, but I've heard you talk about it.
Got it.
Good times.
All right, let's take a break.
That sounds like a good idea, Ron.
Yeah, this show's getting a little crazy.
So we're going to take a quick break.
We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
