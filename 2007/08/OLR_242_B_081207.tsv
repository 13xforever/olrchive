0	4760	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream
4760	5760	twice weekly.
5760	12240	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links
12240	15480	to websites with listings of past episodes.
15480	19960	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19960	24920	And welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 242, this part
24920	27520	B on August 12th, 2007.
27520	30960	Of course, we do tape live on Sunday nights at www.orangeloungeradio.com, and we have
30960	34240	a chat room full of folks who are chatting about what we were talking about during the
34240	37700	bonus segment, which is for the live-only folks, where we're talking about possibly
37700	42080	creating a fighting game that would be like Capcom versus SNK, except it would be Orange
42080	46140	Lounge Radio versus All Games Interactive, and I think the results there would be hilarious.
46140	50460	So we'll have to talk more about that, maybe make a thread in the forums and see if All
50460	54680	Games would want to get some of their talented artists and game designers in on it, too.
54680	56760	Just do it in one of those, like, create-your-own-fighting-game programs.
56760	57760	I think it would be hilarious.
57760	59520	A lot of people would enjoy that.
59520	64160	All right, and meanwhile, let's get back into the gaming news and talk about the real console
64160	67560	gaming news out there, and I believe Loki's going to start us off this segment.
67560	72960	Yes, apparently there's a rumor going around that Sony's going to acquire Rockstar Games,
72960	80000	and I guess this would be good for Sony, since, you know, they need more first-party games,
80000	86080	and definitely having the Grand Theft Auto franchise to themselves would be pretty good.
86080	90240	Although, I don't know, apparently various sources of the press and, I guess, development
90240	96080	team are saying that Sony is looking to take Rockstar under their wings, and I know that
96080	104360	they have, was it LA Nor coming out for the PlayStation 3 exclusively in the spring, so
104360	105360	I don't know.
105360	109160	They're saying also, I guess, there's going to be another exclusive game afterwards, but
109160	116000	I can't help but think there, you know, maybe some exclusive games for Sony, but I doubt
116000	119680	that they're actually going to be bought up by Sony, because, I mean, they're making money
119680	125200	hand over fist, so they'd be so stupid they cut out the Xbox 360.
125200	128400	Doesn't it seem like this story is somewhat like jumping to conclusions?
128400	132520	Like that's the feeling I got when I read it, is that, oh, well, Rockstar's been working
132520	138300	a lot with Sony, and now they're doing this exclusive thing for Sony, so therefore Sony's
138300	139640	going to be buying Rockstar.
139640	145180	I don't think, I mean, think about it, I mean, why would they say, I mean, I guess if they're
145180	149920	part of Sony, it doesn't matter that they're not selling as many units, but they're not
149920	155600	exactly suffering or struggling financially, I think, I mean, granted, you know, Grand
155600	161480	Theft Auto 4 being delayed is not helpful, or all the lawsuits, but shit, when that game
161480	167340	comes out, they're not going to be struggling financially, so, some healthy skepticism courtesy
167340	168660	of the chat room as well.
168660	172080	Frisbee says, not going to happen without a big fight.
172080	176320	Ross Steel UT says, Microsoft just paid them 50 million, it's not going to happen.
176320	177320	Yeah.
177320	178320	Perfect example.
178320	179320	There you go.
179320	184600	Well, one thing that can happen right now on your PSP is a brand new application called
184600	186640	PSPTube.
186640	192300	This is from a Japanese PSP homebrew developer, Sophia Cat, and basically what this does is
192300	196880	it will let you watch YouTube videos on your PSP.
196880	201480	Now, you don't have to convert the files or do whatever, you just basically play the videos
201480	203340	directly from YouTube.
203340	204560	Kind of cool there.
204560	209000	Of course, you do have to go through some hoops and stuff to make it happen.
209000	215280	If you want to check it out, you can visit the Sophia Cat site there and look at more
215280	219800	information, but basically you have to make a developer ID and put it in this file and
219800	222560	then it's kind of a bunch of crap you have to do.
222560	225920	But they're going to, they also just released another new version of it that's supposed
225920	231280	to have a favorites folder and stuff like that, that you can download videos and stuff
231280	232280	from there.
232280	236480	So, unlike, you know, sure you could do this probably through the web browser as well,
236480	239900	but this is actually streaming videos straight off YouTube.
239900	244760	This isn't just viewing them off of a web page or anything, so I guess it's a little
244760	245760	bit better.
245760	247600	SSJ100Matt has a good thought here.
247600	254080	How long until PSPOrnotube, or PSPUporn, or PSPXTube, I mean it's just a matter of
254080	255080	time, right?
255080	256080	I hope.
256080	257640	Because that's what people really want to do on their PSP.
257640	262720	And they get the XXXBox thing coming out.
262720	264000	Boo.
264000	265240	I wanted another cookie, Rob.
265240	269560	The brand new bad joke mistress of Orange Launch Radio, Dark Soccer.
269560	270560	No, no, no.
270560	272740	I was emulating Junami.
272740	280240	I did buy that, I bought it in a 160 gig external hard drive, four videos on either the 360
280240	281240	or PS3.
281240	285040	All right, I will go get Jamie a cookie while she reads the next story.
285040	286760	There's one cookie left.
286760	292880	Well, for anybody who actually gives a crap about this game, and also since it's a UK
292880	302080	release that I'm referring to, it was slipped during a press conference that, well, Activision
302080	307800	UK is only confirming winter, however Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare has been given the
307800	315160	date of November 9th for Europe on PS3, PC, and XBox 360.
315160	318240	So you can have fun shooting down people if you want to.
318240	319240	Enjoy.
319240	322840	And I think that's about the same time as the one in the US is coming out, so it's not
322840	326280	a huge surprise that they're releasing around that same time.
326280	329360	Obviously, extremely awesome game.
329360	337480	I mean, the video that they've been showing so far, very early, but very fucking awesome.
337480	339080	Such a kind of game.
339080	340720	I think so.
340720	344640	The other thing that's kind of interesting, there's a whole PlayStation starter pack that
344640	347680	was going on in the UK.
347680	352940	Apparently it was one where they were actually offering the 60 gig system with Resistance
352940	357120	and Motorstorm and two controllers for a set amount.
357120	363560	Now the problem is that there's conflicting sources saying that the starter pack might
363560	370040	actually be in jeopardy, that they might be done with it in August 31st.
370040	376920	So much like the limited price point drop for the 60 gig system, and that makes sense
376920	382320	if it has a 60 gig system in there, and if they're phasing out the 60 gig, then yeah,
382320	383920	of course it's going to be in jeopardy.
383920	388280	So if you want one, better buy it now.
388280	394440	Alright, well of course PAL is the international format, or the format overseas in the Europe
394440	399280	region for video games and for television signals, and speaking of things that have
399280	405220	been going on overseas as far as video games go, Manhunt 2 of course, lots and lots and
405220	409320	lots of stories hitting the internet when the British Board of Film Classification effectively
409320	411360	banned Manhunt 2.
411360	414800	Something to be considered this week is that Rockstar Games is currently appealing the
414800	422480	decision, and there was actually an associate at game specialist law firm Osborne Clark
422480	426600	said something about how it may be a while before this decision has the possibility to
426600	427600	be overturned.
427600	432480	Quote, last time this happened with Carmageddon, the appeal worked so that's a positive precedent.
432480	436360	Rockstar has taken a while to build its case, so they've obviously been taking stock of
436360	437720	what the BBFC have said.
437720	441320	They'll have to work together to agree on making the right cuts.
441320	448680	So it is possible that the BBFC could reconsider, but we won't find out for quite a long time.
448680	452140	Also something to think about is that quote, if the BBC feels that the violence running
452140	455320	throughout the game is too much, it's not like a film where you can just cut out certain
455320	459800	scenes as of course a lot of people said when the story first hit the internet, when the
459800	461880	game was first banned.
461880	462880	No I'm really disappointed.
462880	468480	I can understand why they would want to censor it and stuff so that it can be released on
468480	473080	all the consoles, but I really wish they would kind of open the console format so that you
473080	480600	can have, you know, what would be the equivalent of an NC-17 game, you know, where it's the
480600	485360	uncut version where you can kill the strippers, fuck them, and then kill them again.
485360	487200	You know, just something like that.
487200	488200	I wish all this talk would just...
488200	491360	Can that be the other way around?
491360	494680	I just wish all this talk would go away and I wish they could just release the damn thing
494680	498980	with an adults only rating and that everybody didn't have a collective thumb up their butt
498980	503320	about how, you know, having adults only games on their platforms are going to corrupt children
503320	506920	across America, you know.
506920	512200	Sony needs to go and say, hey, we'll accept adult only games, go ahead and bring it out
512200	516360	on the Playstation 2 and PS3 exclusively.
516360	517360	There you go.
517360	519440	A little bit of an edge for them.
519440	521320	Alright, well, we shall see what happens.
521320	525360	I'm sure this won't be the last time you hear about Manhunt 2, like it or not.
525360	527960	Well, this is actually pretty cool.
527960	537560	A business called Omega Sector opened in Birmingham, of course, in Europe.
537560	538560	Not the Birmingham in Alabama?
538560	539560	No.
539560	540560	But I've been there.
540560	541560	Okay.
541560	542560	I've been there lots of times.
542560	543560	It's not fun.
543560	545200	Sorry, people in Alabama.
545200	551880	But this is a place that has 400 custom built PCs.
551880	558640	It's 22,000 square feet, two floors, it has an internet cafe, movies, a room for Xbox
558640	567560	360 gaming, sponsored by Squeenix, THQ, Activision, and they've all got their own little places
567560	568560	to play at.
568560	576880	You can play Final Fantasy XI, Call of Duty, Shadow of Chernobyl, Stalker, and it's just
576880	584400	a big, massive gaming spot, and so it's open for business.
584400	589360	Someday when I become rich, I will open something like that and call it the Orange Lounge, but
589360	590360	that's pretty cool, though.
590360	596760	Well, there's two mobile Omega Sectors that will come and do parties and concerts and
596760	600760	things like that, but this is kind of cool.
600760	606160	You pay five pounds to get in, and then you can go around.
606160	609400	There's promo stuff everywhere.
609400	613320	You can basically not just go into play.
613320	619560	You've got stuff for actually interacting with people, so that's kind of cool.
619560	623140	We need one next door.
623140	624140	In the backyard.
624140	625840	Yes, in the backyard.
625840	629000	Now I do have that shed I'm not really using for anything else, so let's install one of
629000	630000	these in there.
630000	635400	Even though there's no air conditioning in there, we'd probably melt.
635400	642920	You know, there's some interesting news coming out about a violent game law in California
642920	648120	that would have restricted anyone from, under the age of 18, from buying or renting violent
648120	650440	video games.
650440	654640	I didn't even know that was in the works, which is interesting.
654640	656720	Well, I'm sure we talked about it previously on the show.
656720	657720	I know we did.
657720	661600	Well, there's been so many states, you know, I just can't keep track of them.
661600	662600	True.
662600	673400	Anyways, so the bill signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger back in 2005, it's been overturned,
673400	677840	so that's interesting because of course it was unconstitutional, yada, yada, yada, pretty
677840	682040	much the same thing that every single state so far has found out.
682040	683760	You know, it was a while ago when this happened.
683760	687480	I think this was back when we were doing the to-go show, we were doing the separate shows,
687480	688480	when this first went through.
688480	691060	I think that's why you forgot about it, because I remember that guy, Leland Yee, they were
691060	695960	parading him amongst all the game blogs and some of the shows on TV and how he wrote this
695960	700360	bill and everything, and to his credit, even if we may not agree with his law personally,
700360	705040	he was at least willing to chat with the game sites and the blogs and stuff.
705040	709320	Yeah, and the thing and problem is it said violent video games, and of course, you know,
709320	710320	what is violent?
710320	711920	You know, that's the problem.
711920	717600	It wasn't like adult-only games or mature-rated games cannot be sold to these people.
717600	718600	That's right.
718600	722820	You know, if they had done something like that, then that would have been a little different.
722820	723820	I don't know.
723820	727360	I think it's stupid that they're having laws for that since they don't have laws for that
727360	731680	for movies or music or anything like that.
731680	732980	So what happens now?
732980	733980	Is it gone forever?
733980	734980	Is it going to go away?
734980	735980	No, of course not.
735980	736980	Never hear about it again?
736980	741520	Of course not, because you know, when it was been deemed unconstitutional, Governor Schwarzenegger
741520	746760	says, well, it will be back, you know, pun intended, of course.
746760	753460	And he says he isn't done protecting the bill's targeted youth.
753460	758360	Thank you, Schwarzenegger, for saving our kids with censorship.
758360	760400	Thank you very much.
760400	761400	Especially since...
761400	765340	Yeah, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Schwarzenegger like, you know, not only star
765340	769640	in but give some money to the Terminator 3 project, which was an R-rated movie that I'm
769640	772620	sure many kids snuck into, I mean, hello?
772620	777160	Or Terminator 2, or Total Recall, I mean, the chick had three boobs, I mean, what kid
777160	779720	is not going to, you know, try to sneak into a movie like that?
779720	780720	I mean, come on.
780720	782240	Where a chick has three boobs?
782240	783240	Exactly.
783240	790060	All right, well, anyhow, you know, news of these laws not going away and just the fact
790060	793080	that here we go again makes us very angsty.
793080	795260	So of course you know what that means.
795260	798720	It's time to make our own violence here on the program with our segment called The F-You's
798720	799720	of the Week.
799720	812540	Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?
812540	819000	My F-You of the Week goes towards people who don't know when to shut up.
819000	824320	People who have to get the last word, who must always be right.
824320	834160	People who don't understand when it's better to let things lie than to prolong a bad situation.
834160	838320	F-You to that.
838320	844800	Loki, all right, my F-You goes to this chair that I'm sitting in because it's horribly
844800	846920	uncomfortable.
846920	852560	It's hard, the back of it's like super stiff, like I feel like my spine is being readjusted.
852560	855000	Not good.
855000	857400	And then also F-You to my computer for resetting.
857400	861640	I reinstalled Windows with Service Pack 2 now.
861640	866540	Not only is my internet slower thanks to that, but I did kind of try to fix that.
866540	868000	It's still resetting randomly.
868000	870200	I just think the motherboard's crapping out.
870200	872680	It's kind of old, so.
872680	875760	Need to build a new computer.
875760	877600	That's it.
877600	880800	My F-You of the Week goes to Comcast for reasons previously mentioned.
880800	884080	I mean, just the fact that they completely were fucking up our order made us wait so
884080	888460	long to get the freaking internet here, and then we were sitting around the whole day
888460	893720	and offered practically no compensation for it, so they suck big floppy donkey dick, so
893720	894720	that's it.
894720	898120	Wow, that was short F-Yous tonight.
898120	901360	I'm quite impressed.
901360	905920	Going from something F-You to something that makes me very, very happy is news on Spore.
905920	909900	Of course, I'm very excited about Spore, and a lot of us have thought, ah, Spore is pretty
909900	913560	much going away for a little while because the damn game's not supposed to come out till,
913560	916280	what, like 2009 now at this point?
916280	923240	Well, Spore didn't show up at E3, but Spore will be showing up at the Leipzig Convention
923240	924840	in Germany.
924840	928480	It's going to be actually playable behind closed doors.
928480	932240	Now, of course, I wonder if that means, okay, is it like last year's E3 where it's going
932240	938200	to be playable by somebody else, or will select lucky few people actually get to play it?
938200	944160	Supposedly Spore is still on track for a 2008 release, but I think most people would agree
944160	947080	they will release it when it's damn good and ready, and they're going to take their sweet
947080	948960	ass time to make sure it's right.
948960	949960	So let's hope so.
949960	955000	Let's hope it's right, but keep your eye on your favorite game blogs from August 23rd
955000	958880	to 26th when the Leipzig Games Convention's going on, because that's when you're likely
958880	959960	to see some news on this.
959960	962760	You see really what's happening, though, is the game is done.
962760	967400	Right now they're just working on emptying Scrooge McDuck's vault so they can stick all
967400	971840	the money in there that they're going to make on this game.
971840	972840	That's what they're doing.
972840	975920	Are they going to go swimming in it?
975920	977320	And they will go swimming in it.
977320	978320	What?
978320	980500	They're going to make tons of money off this thing.
980500	981500	That's what it is.
981500	982960	Stop fucking making playable demos.
982960	986960	I mean, that's all they're working on is goddamn playable demos for these stupid events.
986960	988760	Just finish the fucking game.
988760	991560	They're just trying to tease you.
991560	993560	Then you'll make the money to go in the vault.
993560	994560	They want you teased.
994560	995760	Then you'll be able to swim in it.
995760	999560	I just think it's very random that you brought up Scrooge McDuck's vault.
999560	1001400	I think that that's appropriate.
1001400	1007900	By the way, dear Capcom, Capcom, yeah, where the fuck is DuckTales 3?
1007900	1009080	Why didn't we ever get that?
1009080	1010960	Maybe because DuckTales is off the air?
1010960	1011960	Who cares?
1011960	1012960	Who cares?
1012960	1013960	No, no, no, no.
1013960	1016320	It's all about the DuckTales moon level.
1016320	1017320	I know, for real.
1017320	1018320	The best music ever.
1018320	1023080	DuckTales, what kid that grew up in the 80s doesn't remember the DuckTales video game?
1023080	1026760	DuckTales 2, who cares that it didn't sell at all because it was released towards the
1026760	1028520	end of the NES lifespan.
1028520	1031440	Every kid upgraded to a Super Nintendo at that point.
1031440	1033920	So where is DuckTales 3?
1033920	1035480	Couldn't it be done on the DS?
1035480	1036480	What?
1036480	1039680	Did Capcom release the license or something?
1039680	1041800	It's not on the air anymore.
1041800	1043480	They're hanging out with Duke Nukem.
1043480	1044580	Who cares?
1044580	1045580	Look at Kingdom Hearts.
1045580	1048200	Scrooge McDuck's in Kingdom Hearts and so is Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
1048200	1051160	But that's also got a lot of the more modern.
1051160	1055480	The Tron is in Kingdom Hearts 2, which makes me happy.
1055480	1058960	But you remember, though, those characters were not only on DuckTales.
1058960	1063120	They actually existed in other cartoon shorts before DuckTales.
1063120	1065840	Okay, I don't really give a shit who makes the DuckTales game.
1065840	1068160	I just want one and I want it to not suck.
1068160	1069160	Make it yourself.
1069160	1074280	They can maybe do a DuckTales level in Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a Darkwing Duck level.
1074280	1075280	Yeah, Darkwing Duck.
1075280	1077560	Supposedly, Kingdom Hearts 3 is not Kingdom Hearts 3.
1077560	1079160	Okay, Kingdom Hearts 3.5.
1079160	1082400	Kingdom Hearts 2 is another game, you know?
1082400	1083400	Like they do.
1083400	1084400	2-2 or something.
1084400	1087520	I don't know.
1087520	1088520	That's what Ross Tilly UT says.
1088520	1091440	Kingdom Hearts has shit from the 50s in it.
1091440	1096640	Even earlier than that, they have the Timeless River or whatever that level is called.
1096640	1097640	That level is awesome.
1097640	1098640	That's the Steamboat Willie level.
1098640	1103200	But you know, that's like classic Disney.
1103200	1107400	It's not like, they don't have a tailspin level.
1107400	1110200	Ballora's not wearing it.
1110200	1112560	That's because tailspin is rip-off of the Jungle Book.
1112560	1116800	You do get one Gummy Bears reference, which is pretty awesome, because you have the Gummy
1116800	1117800	Ship, right?
1117800	1119880	Oh, that's not really the Gummy Bears, though.
1119880	1123520	But that's what I like to think in my own mind, is that it's a Gummy Bears reference.
1123520	1126720	The thing has absolutely nothing to do with Gummy Bears.
1126720	1127720	Shut up!
1127720	1132400	But we've got our poo level, and I hate the poo levels because they're not all that fun.
1132400	1139040	Where's my level based on Swiss Family Robinson?
1139040	1140680	Where's the Herbie Love Bug level?
1140680	1144840	They need to have Bruce Campbell in that one, too, because Bruce Campbell is in a Herbie
1144840	1145840	movie.
1145840	1146840	Or what was the dog?
1146840	1148040	Not Old Yeller, but the other one.
1148040	1149440	Shaggy the Dog or whatever it was?
1149440	1150440	A Shaggy Dog.
1150440	1151440	A Shaggy Dog.
1151440	1152440	That's it.
1152440	1154080	That darn cat below there.
1154080	1155800	What about the Witch Mountain movies?
1155800	1157200	All right.
1157200	1158200	I love those.
1158200	1159200	Now we're getting random.
1159200	1160360	Let's please go to another story.
1160360	1167360	Speaking of random, actually not really, there are new Wii Virtual Console stuff rated out
1167360	1168360	now.
1168360	1171880	Thank you, ESRB, you bastards.
1171880	1173840	Thank you, you bastards.
1173840	1175160	I love that.
1175160	1177320	Well, what games are they?
1177320	1178320	We have...
1178320	1179320	Faithful News Reporter.
1179320	1183160	Landstalker, The Treasures of King Knoll.
1183160	1184260	I never played that.
1184260	1186000	I've never even fucking heard of that game.
1186000	1188080	Shinobi 3, Return of the Ninja Master.
1188080	1189080	I'm sorry.
1189080	1190960	Shadow Dancer was better.
1190960	1195120	Shadow Dancer was the best Shinobi game ever.
1195120	1196120	And...
1196120	1197120	And...
1197120	1198120	Ghoulsy Ghosts.
1198120	1199120	Yay!
1199120	1202920	Wow, they're really getting obscure on some of these Genesis and TurboGrafx titles that
1202920	1203920	are coming out.
1203920	1207280	And yet, we still don't have Guardian Legend, speaking of obscure.
1207280	1212680	Why don't you have Metal Gear on Virtual Console?
1212680	1215680	Where are some of the other old Konami classics, besides just Grapple?
1215680	1221920	You know, there's a good point that they make here that just because it's rated doesn't
1221920	1223680	mean it's going to come out.
1223680	1230200	So, who knows, like, what the fuck, Landstalker, whatever.
1230200	1234320	You know, they should let me pick games for the Virtual Console, because I'd put Panorama
1234320	1238160	Cotton all up in there.
1238160	1240480	Rasteel UT makes fun of what Jamie said.
1240480	1241800	Thank you, you bastards.
1241800	1246600	Rasteel UT says, I'm very gracious, you retarded spastic fags.
1246600	1253880	You know, it's like, if I were to pick games for their Virtual Console, I would be just
1253880	1258380	like, well, how about we pick the one where you fix the fucking internet thing and make
1258380	1264200	it so it's actually, you know, games playable over, you know, Wi-Fi and shit like that.
1264200	1266840	Stop working on Virtual Console games and fix my goddamn Wii internet.
1266840	1269280	Hit an Excitebike and have the save mode work.
1269280	1271280	Son of Dad has a damn good point.
1271280	1272920	Where the fuck is Michael Jackson's Moonwalker?
1272920	1273920	Dude, I know!
1273920	1274920	That game was great.
1274920	1278400	I mean, besides all that, you know, child molestation he ran for other countries bullshit.
1278400	1279400	I mean, come on!
1279400	1280400	It was a great game.
1280400	1282600	You know what game that we need on Virtual Console?
1282600	1283600	The Goonies.
1283600	1284600	Not the Goonies 2.
1284600	1286200	No, we need Goonies 2 as well.
1286200	1289400	Well, we need that eventually, but we need the first one that came out.
1289400	1290400	I'm saying, where's all the Konami?
1290400	1291400	There was a first one?
1291400	1292400	Yes, there was.
1292400	1294320	Yeah, there was, but only in Japan, I think.
1294320	1299600	And it had an arcade release that was one of those timed Nintendo crappy games that,
1299600	1303600	you know, they had the Super Mario Brothers one where all your enemies are beetle bugs.
1303600	1308080	All right, let's get past that quintessential games we want on Virtual Console stuff.
1308080	1309440	Get back into some news.
1309440	1315080	All right, well, it's very unfortunate that this super awesome game is only exclusive
1315080	1320000	at Walmart, but Chibi-Robo DS, people thought that it might have been scrapped at first,
1320000	1321000	but guess what?
1321000	1325320	Walmart's going to have the exclusive rights to this super awesome game.
1325320	1327040	No, really, it really, really sucks.
1327040	1329360	It is a horrible game, played at E3.
1329360	1332400	Well, the GameCube one was kind of shitty too.
1332400	1338800	Well, let me put it this way, the DS captures the essence of the GameCube game perfectly.
1338800	1344620	So yay, Chibi-Robo Park Patrol will launch October 2nd at Walmart, so you know what?
1344620	1348640	And Walmart is releasing it in a limited edition baby shit green case.
1348640	1349640	Who knew?
1349640	1354480	Oh wait, that's not the case, that's actually baby shit.
1354480	1360440	Well, I don't know if you could get this at Walmart, but I certainly would like to be
1360440	1362200	able to get this.
1362200	1368760	DreamKitty.com is offering these very cute little overlays for your Nintendo DS.
1368760	1371800	They're Hello Kitty overlays, that's right.
1371800	1377160	You could take your pink DS light and make it pinker with new Hello Kitty overlays you
1377160	1381980	can get, and it looks like bling a little bit, like they have gemstones on it, but that's
1381980	1386280	a little pattern there, Hello Kitty thing on the front, and then little kitty designs.
1386280	1390200	Actually there's really not any kitties inside, it's all like flowers and gems and all sorts
1390200	1391200	of other girly shit.
1391200	1394640	I'm surprised they're not selling this at the Sanrio store.
1394640	1400520	$16.49 plus shipping if you would like to buy this at DreamKitty.com, and I know I want
1400520	1402560	it, so we'll see.
1402560	1404440	I'm seriously considering buying it, how cool would that be?
1404440	1409880	And as the article says, go for it, you'll sure be the envy of every ten year old girl
1409880	1410880	on the block.
1410880	1411880	I know.
1411880	1416080	Well hold on, when people come into the house and they see my Hello Kitty toaster and my
1416080	1419000	Hello Kitty coffee maker, it always gets a comment.
1419000	1423000	Oh my god, you bought that?
1423000	1427920	No, mostly it's been, oh my gosh, my daughter would love that.
1427920	1431960	Alright, anyway.
1431960	1436560	Let's open up the mailbag and get a little serious here on Orange Lounge Radio, and open
1436560	1440520	up ye old mailbag and see what you guys, listeners, have to say.
1440520	1444360	Go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place you can always send those emails to, and Dark
1444360	1448000	Soccer is going to dive on in and pull out some of her favorite emails.
1448000	1455640	So here she goes.
1455640	1461600	The first of three emails that I'm going to read, it says, Hey, OLR guys, not sure if
1461600	1464960	this question has been covered before, but if it has, sorry about that, okay, we forgive
1464960	1465960	you.
1465960	1466960	Next email.
1466960	1471200	Sites such as BimaniStyle.com and its message board cater to Bimani players mainly in the
1471200	1472920	U.S. with an English language.
1472920	1476760	GameFacts.com is another major site with a large message board that deals with all sorts
1476760	1477760	of video games.
1477760	1483920	It is another site with a user base predominantly from the U.S. that speaks English.
1483920	1490320	Using those two sites as an example and excluding 2chan from the answer, what is one Bimani
1490320	1495520	site from Japan and one major video game and general site from Japan that caters to players
1495520	1499780	from the Japanese region with a fully functional message board and a user base from the same
1499780	1500780	region?
1500780	1505680	I ask this because we don't hear much from these sites and they don't get much recognition
1505680	1510160	for being a major thriving site outside of Japan.
1510160	1512520	Thanks, Snaps.
1512520	1518800	Well first of all, I think that I'm the only person in this room that really reads much
1518800	1524480	Japanese and that's maybe 30 kanji if I'm lucky, so we typically don't go to those sites
1524480	1529960	given that we can't reliably read them and that Nifty Global Gate doesn't always translate
1529960	1530960	quite right.
1530960	1534120	Yeah, unfortunately I don't have a lot to give you there for the same reason, like I
1534120	1537960	don't speak Japanese so going to those sites doesn't do me a lot of good, but I can give
1537960	1538960	you this.
1538960	1539960	Erin in Japan.
1539960	1542680	There is a site, well actually outside of that I can give you one site that's all in
1542680	1547360	Japanese as far as the what is a good Bimani site with boards to look at and that would
1547360	1554680	be a website called Mia's Another Leaf and that site is m-i-e-y-a dot cool dot n-e dot
1554680	1558560	j-p and I first discovered this site because they actually have us linked on it and so
1558560	1562280	it came up in the referrer's log and so I checked out the site and they run a fully
1562280	1566560	functional news blog and I'm pretty extensive on the Bimani coverage there and of course
1566560	1570880	they have some DDR characters, Alice and Emmy in their logo, so you know they've been around
1570880	1572160	a long time.
1572160	1577600	The site brags that they've been up since 2001, March 6th of 2001 they've been running
1577600	1580680	so there you go, that's the site you can definitely check out.
1580680	1582880	Again that's Mia's Another Leaf.
1582880	1587280	As far as the more general gaming site, I don't know unfortunately I couldn't tell you.
1587280	1590080	Next time you send us an email tell us the site you want us to plug and we'll check it
1590080	1591080	out.
1591080	1594080	General gaming site, I would say probably Famitsu dot com.
1594080	1596560	Yeah there is Famitsu.
1596560	1601080	I'm sure they have forums that go along with it.
1601080	1603320	Alright next email then.
1603320	1609720	Next email dun dun dun is um, there's a sigh.
1609720	1611240	Hello all at Orange Lounge Radio.
1611240	1614360	You know what Jamie, I officially share your annoyance of children.
1614360	1618200	Their greedy, sticky fingered, badgering brats who have left in control of parents who don't
1618200	1621840	know what the hell they're doing can become Satan incarnate.
1621840	1622840	Wow.
1622840	1627320	My cousin is a perfect example, complete lack of discipline for that kid.
1627320	1631560	Also I was at the arcade today for some good old fashioned DDR Max 2 and with my luck there
1631560	1633880	was a party with a bunch of munchkins running around.
1633880	1636880	While I played this little girl kept asking me for money.
1636880	1639160	Now come on.
1639160	1643320	I was told never to ask strangers for money when I was a kid and I never did.
1643320	1646120	But yeah her mother wasn't even around either.
1646120	1650000	Then another kid came up and started jumping on the arrows behind me while I was selecting
1650000	1651000	a song.
1651000	1653960	I went to move back onto the map and began to play the song and he almost runs into me.
1653960	1657320	Thank God his mother finally showed up or that kid would have lost a foot had I stepped
1657320	1658320	on it.
1658320	1660680	Ever had this experience at your local arcade with children?
1660680	1661680	Yeah it sucks.
1661680	1664320	Whatever you do Jamie, just don't reproduce.
1664320	1667840	You and your husband will live happy lives.
1667840	1668840	Sincerely Osifer.
1668840	1669840	P.S.
1669840	1672720	I'm not sure if I spelled your name correctly, feel free to connect me.
1672720	1674800	And Rob, spaz your anger.
1674800	1676440	You spelled my name correctly by the way.
1676440	1677440	Thank you.
1677440	1682520	Well Osifer we'd all like to thank you for the email here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1682520	1685440	And so would all the screaming children.
1685440	1686440	I don't know.
1686440	1689080	I mean you know kids are kids.
1689080	1694520	I think kids when being parented actively aren't so bad.
1694520	1698000	But unfortunately at a lot of these types of places like the arcade and Chuck E. Cheese
1698000	1700760	these are places where the parents go to get a break.
1700760	1702860	And they just let their kids run around like crazy.
1702860	1705040	You did it too when you were a kid.
1705040	1706040	So I didn't.
1706040	1707040	Really?
1707040	1708800	I never ran around like crazy.
1708800	1709800	Never ever?
1709800	1710800	In just my backyard.
1710800	1712000	Not in public.
1712000	1715280	I had an all-girl bicycle gang.
1715280	1718720	Wait you were a member of a bike gang?
1718720	1724880	No it was four of us and we would ride the streets like we were on patrol.
1724880	1730240	Only I had like the best bike of everybody so nobody could keep up with me.
1730240	1734440	I'm fascinated by the fact that you were in a bike gang when you were a little girl.
1734440	1736960	That's amazing.
1736960	1740680	But I wasn't a problem child like that.
1740680	1744200	Because keep in mind if you grow up in the south your parents don't give a shit about
1744200	1746040	all this PC bullshit.
1746040	1747840	They're just going to discipline you.
1747840	1752140	You have all that stuff that Bill Engvall said about going out to the tree and picking
1752140	1753520	your own switch.
1753520	1755480	I did that.
1755480	1758760	That is cruel and unusual punishment.
1758760	1760560	Wowzers.
1760560	1762520	Yeah I had a birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese.
1762520	1765740	We all ran around like crazy while our parents sat around and gossiped.
1765740	1766740	That's how it worked.
1766740	1770240	I think there's a difference between actually going to an arcade and going to a place where
1770240	1773200	you're expected to be overrun by a bajillion children.
1773200	1779160	At least with an arcade you expect to have people monitoring their children.
1779160	1781000	Well look at what's happening in arcades.
1781000	1782400	They're all turning into birthday palaces.
1782400	1789480	Well at my arcade when I worked at one we would ask, we would not let any child under
1789480	1794640	a particular age be without an adult accompanying them.
1794640	1799720	Even if it was the adult with their little group we wouldn't let them just run amuck.
1799720	1800720	No small children.
1800720	1801720	Wow.
1801720	1805880	But you know, I like Namco.
1805880	1807480	So shall I go on?
1807480	1808760	You shall.
1808760	1809760	Maybe I won't.
1809760	1810760	I will.
1810760	1811760	This is from Misty.
1811760	1812760	Aww.
1812760	1813760	Hi Misty.
1813760	1815480	I thought closing on Sundays.
1815480	1818840	I can't be the only one able to close this night, no.
1818840	1821480	I can't be the only one able to close this night of the week.
1821480	1822480	I miss you guys.
1822480	1823480	Heart Misty.
1823480	1824480	Aww.
1824480	1825960	That was a sharp but sweet email.
1825960	1827960	Well I miss you too.
1827960	1829400	Is that it?
1829400	1830400	That's it.
1830400	1831400	We need more emails.
1831400	1835040	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you would like to send us some emails.
1835040	1836440	Give us some more stuff to read next week.
1836440	1841280	Well before I forget I did want to say that there's no pump up the volume this week either.
1841280	1843980	Last week there was a funeral.
1843980	1846440	This week I have a class.
1846440	1847440	So no pump.
1847440	1848440	Sorry.
1848440	1849440	Alright.
1849440	1850440	We will have some weeknight shows.
1850440	1852120	Slowly returning probably after the summer.
1852120	1857480	I know Travis is finally back on Saturdays and I want to say that DMN said he's doing
1857480	1862380	his thing on Thursdays and whatever so there's lots of stuff coming up as far as the weeknight
1862380	1865360	shows go and then Wednesday night should be back pretty soon as well after all this summer
1865360	1867480	craziness has ended.
1867480	1869720	So let's get back into some game news.
1869720	1870720	Loki keep us up.
1870720	1871720	Summer craziness.
1871720	1872720	Anyways.
1872720	1879440	Now so I was going to say there's some interesting things.
1879440	1885400	Not a huge surprise with the day and age that we're living in but airport security is beginning
1885400	1890840	to inspect game consoles and you know don't worry they're not going to break them open
1890840	1895720	to make sure that's the game console but they will x-ray them for you and they probably
1895720	1900280	will I don't think they're going to forbid you from bringing them on the plane but just
1900280	1903300	so you know it will be x-rayed.
1903300	1905520	I mean is anyone surprised?
1905520	1910240	I bring DS's on the plane and you just have to put them on the x-ray belt like anything
1910240	1911240	else so.
1911240	1912240	Exactly.
1912240	1916440	It doesn't seem like anything new to me but I guess maybe the big fat consoles they're
1916440	1920940	doing now like if you put them in your luggage maybe they're like my wife and go why are
1920940	1927760	you bringing that around it's not a portable console what the fuck because you're a hardcore
1927760	1933000	nerd I don't know yes well one thing you could bring around with you if you own an iPhone
1933000	1941520	is NES games that's right there's new NES emulator for the iPhone and it doesn't run
1941520	1946880	so great but it's kind of cool that it's actually in production it actually produces a little
1946880	1951000	tiny Nintendo style controller on the bottom of your iPhone screen and then you play the
1951000	1958080	game in the main iPhone display it's pretty I guess simple to get up and running but unfortunately
1958080	1962600	it's slow there's no sound the controls are not that great for right now but hey it's
1962600	1966640	a start and it shows that it can be done now the first thing you got to do is of course
1966640	1970400	you have to you know kind of hack your iPhone because you know the way you get some of the
1970400	1978880	other stuff on there but it's possible it's very possible anything is possible of course
1978880	1984520	I don't have an iPhone so I couldn't tell you I got to see melody's iPhone oh yeah how's
1984520	1988720	she liking that she likes it okay I actually thought it was going to be fairly prohibitive
1988720	1993760	you know and in the service plan but apparently if you're already like I'm with singular right
1993760	1997060	now apparently if you're already with them then it's actually just an upgrade to your
1997060	2002400	plan and not like their whole new expensive you know gouge you in the you know eyeball
2002400	2006480	price well that's cool I heard stories about someone being charged three thousand dollars
2006480	2011880	for browsing the internet on their iPhone oh my lord no um they have like some unlimited
2011880	2016000	servicing but I don't know I still don't want one I want you know a phone that I can text
2016000	2020960	with that's it yeah the iPhone's a bit much for me I mean I own a phone that doesn't shut
2020960	2025940	off every you know randomly I understand why people are all getting into it but it's just
2025940	2032960	not for me just not for me you know I have a laptop I'm happy with it anyway there is
2032960	2040360	a little bit of information coming out of the South Park camp for anyone who is picking
2040360	2048200	up the season 10 DVD bundle you get a 14-day trial of World of Warcraft which is kind of
2048200	2052600	funny because season 10 had the Warcraft episode in it huh yeah but also Blizzard helped them
2052600	2059280	with it which I thought was funny wow but what I don't know I finally saw the episode
2059280	2068600	it was funny I would think that most people man bathroom I would think that most I would
2068600	2073880	think that most people who watch South Park have probably already given World of Warcraft
2073880	2079680	to try once in their life at least I just thought that I haven't you know you know who
2079680	2083080	I finally got to play World of Warcraft this week by the way I heard you're finally back
2083080	2087600	like I saw your post in the forums well yeah if anyone would actually add my noob character
2087600	2090800	to the guild and tell me what you're gonna be on tell me when you're gonna be on next
2090800	2094920	and I'll I'll send you money and get you in the guild okay and you know who you can play
2094920	2100360	with now who's also a noob William the boyfriend is on he started playing World of Warcraft
2100360	2104180	because he was such a Starcraft fan like he still plays Starcraft now it's like the one
2104180	2108880	game he really does play and is really into and you know we kind of said well if you like
2108880	2111480	that game why aren't you playing like World of Warcraft or some of the other blizzard
2111480	2115680	titles so he tried it out and he loved it so now he sucked into it World of Warcraft
2115680	2122300	when there's absolutely nothing else to do so I play about once a month but when I play
2122300	2125940	I play for a while yeah stay far away while you still can because once you get sucked
2125940	2130980	in it's it's it's bad I won't get sucked in well even when I played Final Fantasy 11
2130980	2137080	I didn't get sucked in that's because you hated it but I was really good with a controller
2137080	2141800	hey I could do all that macro crap with a controller that's cool hey you should have
2141800	2145560	been playing on 360 you saw you saw me do that too I know and I remember commenting
2145560	2148960	like wow how do you do all that shit with a controller of course the game was designed
2148960	2152520	for the PlayStation 2 so it's supposed to be played with a controller but I I would
2152520	2157280	never be able to do it I I actually had a hard time figure out the macros on my function
2157280	2160640	key so I just like screw it I use my controller and then I got so pissed off I couldn't play
2160640	2170200	World of Warcraft with the controller I was like damn it all right anyway yes this only
2170200	2180680	could come from Second Life but apparently there is a virtual sex program called I guess
2180680	2186940	made by a company called Eros LLC and it makes realistic genitalia and creates sexual moves
2186940	2194800	for Second Life citizens and apparently this one guy who created it found out that his
2194800	2201560	works have been resold by someone else who has been claiming that he made it but so now
2201560	2215680	he is going to be suing them actually it's interesting the whole sex in Second Life but
2215680	2219880	somebody should sue everybody involved for bringing sex to Second Life I mean really
2219880	2225200	because that's all some people think about and where the hell is that three feel game
2225200	2231320	that we saw e3 two years ago hello random three feel was great it was funny because
2231320	2235760	they're no no no no don't do that they had to get their translator because I wasn't supposed
2235760	2242320	to click the button SSJ 100 matt says because we can make girly count SSJ 100 man our charm
2242320	2250400	says because people can't get First Life sex that's fine I guess well on to a little bit
2250400	2255080	more serious note and something not often talked about would be the good side of gaming
2255080	2259200	you know we hear about all these laws and all these you know sex-crazed pervs ruining
2259200	2264520	games well there's some good news about the good of gaming that's going on and it's actually
2264520	2271600	thanks to Wii Sports the Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute at Minneapolis's Abbott Northwestern
2271600	2277480	Hospital actually aids patients who suffered from strokes by letting them play Wii Sports
2277480	2283660	that's right it's kind of a little bit of their rehab program kind of interesting coordination
2283660	2288320	there's actually an article that was ran in a local paper called the Star Tribune that
2288320	2292920	talks about the we have a program and even has a picture of a guy they're playing Wii
2292920	2299240	Sports so kind of cool there and let's see you a quote here from one of the patients
2299240	2304320	quote I'm not a video game player this is the only one I've ever played because of the
2304320	2308140	interaction of the game I get the physical sensation of playing tennis it really works
2308140	2314840	it can fool me into thinking that I'm doing what's happening on the screen kind of cool
2314840	2320520	so that's cool that's why we play games to so we won't get strokes I mean I don't I play
2320520	2327400	games because they're fun I don't well but it's both simulation games anyway well I'm
2327400	2331840	glad to see the games being used for good and reporting on you know some of the good
2331840	2337100	stuff about games so there you go of course I don't know I if these patients are like
2337100	2343040	me they're gonna get bored of Wii Sports in a day or so but maybe I'm just jaded I think
2343040	2350040	it's more fun if you've got people there with you true at any rate though for those who
2350040	2356500	were are into simulations speaking of that type of thing well not really it's rock band
2356500	2368400	I mean hey a price point is released of $199 and if you have an Xbox 360 guess what no
2368400	2378240	wireless screwed who cares wireless is kind of overrated wires are long wires can be extended
2378240	2383760	wrap up the wires stop being so lazy it's wireless really that big a deal maybe I guess
2383760	2388720	I don't think so especially if you've got the drum hooked up with the wires and a microphone
2388720	2392400	hooked up with the wires and you're gonna have a tripping hazard all right I'll give
2392400	2396240	you that the only issue that this game is going to have with that is not everyone's
2396240	2402400	going to have a USB port hub and what you're going to try to play for players you like
2402400	2410440	were the other USB port so you know that's the only issue that this will have but the
2410440	2415600	reason why I think they're not doing wireless is because you know to license the wireless
2415600	2421320	you know technology patent or whatever from Microsoft Microsoft just give them a buy on
2421320	2426800	it for this it caught well look at guitar hero I mean their guitars are ten dollars
2426800	2434440	more for the wireless so I don't know not a big deal though but it is pretty cool if
2434440	2439520	you don't want to get the $199 bundle though with it you can actually buy the game by itself
2439520	2444740	and then all the guitars and stuff will be sold separately at a certain retailers out
2444740	2448400	there because you can use a guitar here controller on it right yeah I think so so if I already
2448400	2451520	have guitar hero two then I'm pretty much and I'm not really interested in the drums
2451520	2455920	honestly I just want to play online with friends and I can use a guitar and I'll do the vocals
2455920	2462620	oh I'm getting the set same I know it's stupid because I hate guitar hero you won't play
2462620	2467320	it past a day I give it a day that you're gonna play it and that's it I'm getting I'm
2467320	2474680	of course gonna get the set now you might give it two days no we still play guitar hero
2474680	2478360	at my house you you damn time you and Dan will have fun with that because Dan likes
2478360	2482280	to play guitar right he brings his buddies over yeah and of course that's when I go hide
2482280	2485960	because you know they all get extra manly around each other well that's the thing I
2485960	2489320	just I won't buy the game because I'll just go over to Loki's house to play it or your
2489320	2493260	house come to my house well if all we still need to play Super Metroid Rob oh we sure
2493260	2499360	do let's do that um soon Wednesday no yeah Wednesday maybe Wednesday I don't think though
2499360	2503080	the show will be back this week we'll do it live on air yeah that'll be the Wednesday
2503080	2506640	show from Metroid Rob and Jamie play Super Metroid on air that actually might be kind
2506640	2511560	of a fun show we should actually make that like a regular show like Rob and Jamie play
2511560	2517960	something on air and today we have the Atari 5200 we're playing kicks but because it's
2517960	2522760	the Atari 5200 none of the controllers work yeah we could run it through the camera thing
2522760	2525640	I'll have to show you later like we put a camera on the TV and do it that way let's
2525640	2533200	do that I think we can show OMG OMG all right anyhow sorry we're gonna open up the Skype
2533200	2537000	line very soon but we got one more story for you guys before we do that and of course when
2537000	2541240	the Skype line is open you can give us a call to talk to us our username on Skype is orange
2541240	2548280	lounge radio or you can actually call us on the real phone 1-877-GAME-OLR anyway so Circuit
2548280	2555120	City isn't too happy with CheapAssGamer because of course as you'll remember one of their
2555120	2564760	forum posters by the name of Speedy1961 had leaked the ads from Circuit City to the website
2564760	2571320	and of course that revealed the price drop information for the Playstation 3 and none
2571320	2577560	were too happy about that so they've actually subpoenaed CheapAssGamer to try to find out
2577560	2585800	who the real identity of Speedy1961 is but of course CheapAssGamer is going to be fighting
2585800	2592400	this because they want to protect the rights of their posters so it should be interesting
2592400	2601880	RasteelUT says looks like an employee is going to get his ass fired I don't know if it's
2601880	2605800	an employee of any one of those because I think they also had Best Buy and other types
2605800	2610480	of ads leaked as well Rob D says we got to fight for our right to
2610480	2618760	ad scan well I mean what do you guys think do you think they have the right to be putting
2618760	2621960	out the subpoena out there or do you think maybe if they wanted to protect the information
2621960	2625520	they shouldn't have kind of leaked it in the first place both I think well I don't know
2625520	2631660	if they have I mean granted it's you know stuff that's not supposed to be out there
2631660	2635800	so they have the right to protect that but at the same time you know they should be more
2635800	2640880	careful with you know information getting leaked maybe have more of these people signing
2640880	2647880	you know non-disclosure agreements and stuff like that I don't know if there's any if they
2647880	2652880	are smart there should be some sort of policy you know regarding this if it is an employee
2652880	2658600	that's you know doing that and they should be able to take proper action based on that
2658600	2663240	policy if they don't have a policy in place for that then well you know you kind of setting
2663240	2667760	yourself up for trouble all right well you guys can call right now and give us your opinion
2667760	2672400	because the skype line is open again our username on skype is orange lounge radio or our 800
2672400	2679180	number is 1-877-GAME-OLR skype line is open and we're taking calls so we'll go ahead and
2679180	2687880	go to the first call at least we're going to try to go to the first call here I hate

2764440	2769880	wrong because it's mountain dew imagine pepsi and citrus cherry kind of had sex with each
2769880	2779080	other and you get this kind of bastardation well I thought it was like live wire and code

2872980	2874980	Alright, you're welcome. Have a good one buddy. Thanks for calling.
2874980	2876980	YouTube. Bye.
2876980	2879980	Alright, let's go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2879980	2886980	Again, if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
2889980	2893980	And unfortunately only one call can come through at a time or everything kind of gets screwed up here.
2893980	2895980	So we're going to another call.
2897980	2900980	Man, I can't handle this. This Skype needs to be changed.
2900980	2902980	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
2902980	2904980	Um...
2906980	2907980	Hello?
2907980	2908980	Yeah.
2908980	2910980	Hi, hello. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
2910980	2915980	Nah, it's Legend of Zaku. Just seeing, you know, since I was trying to get through it and everything.
2915980	2917980	That's alright. What's on your mind buddy?
2917980	2921980	Uh, nothing. Just trying to struggle through disappointments over the weekend.
2921980	2925980	In particular, Supernova 2, which has been crapping out in Jersey Gardens.
2925980	2930980	I've heard that there's another location test for DDR Supernova 2. What's the deal?
2930980	2936980	It was the same place where they had the second Supernova location.
2936980	2939980	You know, they had another Supernova location test last year.
2939980	2948980	Anyways, what I've been able to gather from all the folks around my area that actually went to the location test on Thursday.
2948980	2960980	There were brand new Paranoias discovered. In particular, Paranoia Hades. Just started shaping up to become a really good 9-footer.
2960980	2966980	I'm trying to dig up the information right now. We have crossovers in the form of Bloody Tears.
2966980	2972980	You know, that Castlevania song from Distorted actually now making its appearance in DDR.
2972980	2982980	I'm trying to see what else. I know it was a whole bunch of videos, but I'll post it right now in the chat.
2982980	2990980	Wait, so you actually got to play the test. You went out to Jersey to play the test. Hello?
2990980	2998980	Not really. Because, you know, it was working up until Thursday and then Friday was just crapping out ever since.
2998980	3003980	Saturday it managed to get up, but then it started crashing after just scrolling through songs.
3003980	3006980	When I showed up today, it was still back to Supernova.
3006980	3011980	I see. A band that says if you just type Supernova 2 into YouTube, you can get a bunch of stuff.
3011980	3016980	It is a test machine, Zaku. It's not going to work perfectly, right?
3016980	3022980	Right. I assume they had a bad upgrade kit for all intents and purposes.
3022980	3027980	They're probably going to straighten those issues out. It could be hardware related.
3027980	3034980	Let me try to keep this constructive. Zaku, what would be the one thing you would want to see Konami do with Supernova 2?
3034980	3040980	Well, I know they probably won't be able to do this. Memory card slots, which is damn near impossible at this point.
3040980	3048980	EMUs would be nice. Just follow through on it. Make it offline in addition to online versions.
3048980	3058980	Just so they could get more arcades to adopt it for those that don't have the money or don't have the means of actually getting an internet connection.
3058980	3062980	All right. Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Zaku?
3062980	3070980	That's pretty much it. Hopefully, if that thing gets back up, try to get some more info.
3070980	3085980	But as far as it goes, there are brand new 10-footers showing up, especially from the videos. Especially in the only course boss rush.
3085980	3089980	So it certainly gives something to keep people busy, huh?
3089980	3097980	So far, it's been positive. We're just trying to get through the issues that are holding the test room happier further.
3097980	3102980	All right. Well, Zaku, we're going to let you go so we can take more calls. Thank you very much for your call. We appreciate it.
3102980	3109980	How's it going? Again, if you want to call us, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
3109980	3111980	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
3111980	3112980	GS68.
3112980	3114980	Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?
3114980	3116980	Finally got to play Maximum Tune 3.
3116980	3118980	Oh, what'd you think?
3118980	3128980	Pretty awesome. Especially like the new Ghost Battle mode where you raise someone's ghost and then after that your ghost gets created.
3128980	3131980	And then after that the machine creates a ghost of your driving.
3131980	3137980	Now, out of curiosity, did you play this on the PlayStation or did you play this on the arcade?
3137980	3139980	I'm talking about the arcade one.
3139980	3145980	I think the PlayStation 3 one is based off an older game or something. But you played the PlayStation 3 one. What'd you think?
3145980	3150980	I didn't get it, but again, I can't read Japanese, but I didn't get any sense of what the hell was going on.
3150980	3156980	I mean, obviously there was racing, but I had no idea what the hell was going on. I mean, that's the downside about importing Japanese games.
3156980	3159980	You don't speak the language. I mean, duh, you're not going to understand the game.
3159980	3168980	The one thing I noticed, I thought the music in the thing I was listening to sucked. I didn't think the music was that great.
3168980	3171980	You mean the one in Maximum Tune 3?
3171980	3174980	Yeah, how is the music in Maximum Tune 3 GS68 in the arcades?
3174980	3177980	That's some pretty good stuff.
3177980	3184980	Does it sound like Yuzo Koshiro did it again? Is it the same stuff from Maximum Tune 2?
3184980	3186980	Yeah, I've already got a few favorites.
3186980	3190980	Oh, cool. Well, then that's a good sign. I don't know what the hell's wrong with the PlayStation 1 then.
3190980	3195980	Maybe you just haven't played far enough into it or we're just not understanding what the hell we're doing. I don't know.
3195980	3196980	But it didn't look like that much fun.
3196980	3198980	I'm thinking about reselling on eBay.
3198980	3205980	We'll see. Well, certainly I will check out the arcade one if they get in an arcade near us. Maybe I'll change my mind.
3205980	3208980	Or hopefully the PlayStation 1 will come out here eventually. So we'll see.
3208980	3215980	Is it really popular? I mean, are there long lines to play it? Because the racing games seem to still draw crowds at the arcades.
3215980	3223980	Well, I've played it both at Cityville Golf and Mepitas Golf, and there's about four or five people waiting on each machine.
3223980	3228980	Wow. For this day and age, that's still a long wait. That's a popular game.
3228980	3233980	Anything else you want to share with our listeners? GS68.
3233980	3234980	No.
3234980	3239980	I will definitely check out Maximum Tune 3 when I get a chance and let you know. Like the arcade version.
3239980	3242980	I'm not going to base it off a Japanese game I can't understand.
3242980	3243980	All right.
3243980	3244980	All right. Take care, buddy.
3244980	3245980	You too.
3245980	3246980	All right. Bye-bye.
3246980	3254980	All right. We've got enough time for about one more call here. If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our user name on Skype is Orangelaunchradio.
3254980	3256980	But we have another call. Let's go to it.
3256980	3261980	Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio. Who's this?
3261980	3265980	Hi, you are on Orangelaunchradio. Is somebody there? Can you hear me? Hello?
3265980	3267980	It's a celebrity. It's Airman.
3267980	3270980	Hello, this is Chris Alp, where you can pre-order Madden OA and Halo 3. How can I help you?
3270980	3272980	Hi. Oh, there you are.
3272980	3278980	Hi, GameStop, where we can pre-order. I want to pre-order Halo 6. Will you take that for me?
3278980	3280980	No, it's actually the Rob D. How's it going, guys?
3280980	3282980	Oh, good. How about you, Rob D?
3282980	3297980	Not too shabby. I was actually curious. With this Halo Mountain Dew, which I actually did go out and purchase during the break, by the way, because someone described it as a cross between Code Red and regular Mountain Dew, and I love Code Red, but that's a different story altogether.
3297980	3298980	Is it good?
3298980	3307980	I actually like it. It's kind of like a Pepsi or Mountain Dew version of, I guess, Sprite, Tropical Remix, if you remember that from a few years ago.
3307980	3310980	Yeah, where the hell are you all getting this at? Like 7-Eleven?
3310980	3313980	What was that? I got it from the local market, actually.
3313980	3315980	Oh, huh. I'll have to look for it while I'm out next.
3315980	3320980	Wait, am I really going to buy a drink just because there's some remote game thing in it? You know what, no.
3320980	3322980	I won't buy it because it's not sugar-free.
3322980	3324980	I'm not going to buy it. Fuck this drink. I don't care what it tastes like.
3324980	3327980	Hey, you bought the blue Pepsi, okay? Come on, you'll buy anything.
3327980	3330980	That's true. That Pepsi Blue was some nasty, nasty shit.
3330980	3332980	But, Rob, we remember Crystal Pepsi.
3332980	3336980	Oh, Crystal Pepsi was lovely. All right, anyway, sorry, Rob D., your thoughts?
3336980	3343980	But I was curious, what licensing agreement between games and some other product would you like to see?
3343980	3353980	I mean, I think that Nintendo's missing a huge thing with not doing, say, a Mario pasta thing, like, hey, it's a Mario Mastachioli.
3353980	3357980	You know, I thought that they had a Mario pasta at one time. I swear to God.
3357980	3360980	Didn't they have the Nintendo Breakfast Entertainment System?
3360980	3361980	No, bring back the cereal.
3361980	3365980	They did have Mario pasta. I remember they had that because there was, like, a little Yoshi shape.
3365980	3369980	It was like Nintendo mac and cheese or something.
3369980	3377980	And to tell Dark Tetsuya Hello Kitty 2DX, it was the Hello Kitty Dreamcast and the Hello Kitty PlayStation 2.
3377980	3380980	Gosh, what video game tie-ins would you like to see?
3380980	3386980	I want to see Burger Time 2 with the Foreman Grill.
3386980	3390980	How about, like, Night Trap 90s? Digital Pictures would still be around if that existed.
3390980	3393980	You could have, like, PS2 FMV games. Oh.
3393980	3396980	Night Trap 90s? What?
3396980	3399980	Yeah, but Dana Plato's not with us anymore to model them.
3399980	3403980	I do like the Halo 3 Underoos. That's pretty awesome.
3403980	3405980	From the grave.
3405980	3406980	Exactly.
3406980	3408980	That's all kinds of weird.
3408980	3411980	They're all about the necrophilia tonight.
3411980	3414980	This is random.
3414980	3417980	Let's see. I'm opening up to the chat room to see what the chat room thinks.
3417980	3422980	Son of Dad says, Nintendo Wii Sports Bowling Shoes.
3422980	3428980	GS68 says, Halo Racing Game with Warthogs, Ghosts, and Pontiac Grand Amps.
3428980	3429980	A reference to something in the last game.
3429980	3431980	We need your mom, the game.
3431980	3435980	Jvmon says, Mario Spaghetti from Chef Boyardee.
3435980	3438980	How about Chef Mario?
3441980	3443980	Give me that.
3443980	3445980	I don't know.
3445980	3448980	Yeah, I'm drawing a blank.
3448980	3452980	I'll have to think about that one. Maybe that's a future list list in our future. I don't know.
3452980	3453980	There you go.
3453980	3454980	I have one more question for you guys.
3454980	3456980	Of course. What's up? One more thing.
3456980	3458980	Nah, not going there.
3458980	3464980	Have you guys heard the news about how 3D Realms supposedly wants to port Duke Nukem 3D over to Xbox Live Arcade?
3464980	3467980	Stop ruining my last minute stories, dammit!
3467980	3470980	The callers are ruining your last minute stories tonight.
3470980	3475980	No, that's great. Yes, I did read that story, even if Loki was going to read it later.
3475980	3480980	This is totally good radio, but I was going to show you. See, they did have it at one time.
3480980	3483980	Here's a commercial for Super Mario Bros. Craft and Macaroni and Cheese.
3489980	3491980	I want that.
3491980	3494980	How come my mom didn't buy me that when I was a kid?
3494980	3498980	I actually remember that because they had tips for Super Mario Land 2 on the back.
3498980	3500980	That's how I found out about the space world.
3500980	3503980	You know what I fucking hate, though, is the macaroni and cheese that's made out of the powder.
3503980	3505980	That shit is so nasty.
3505980	3507980	The bunny ones are good.
3507980	3513980	I like that if I'm going to make mac and cheese, I have to use that more creamy cheese sauce because the powder is nasty.
3513980	3515980	Anyway, sorry. That was horrible radio.
3515980	3518980	And I even forgot what your second question was.
3518980	3521980	I didn't actually get to it yet. I was wondering if you had read the story.
3521980	3525980	I was wondering what other old PC games would you like to see ported to Xbox Live Arcade?
3525980	3532980	I've been clamoring for X-Wing for a long time. I would love multiplayer X-Wing on Xbox Live Arcade.
3532980	3534980	But is there anything else?
3534980	3539980	Okay, we've got Loom. Put Loom on the list. We got it. Check. Understood. Yes, ma'am.
3539980	3541980	Loom was great.
3541980	3543980	Really?
3543980	3545980	Loom, mac and cheese.
3545980	3552980	No, I went and bought a copy of Loom like a year ago on eBay just because I wanted it badly and I can't play it.
3552980	3557980	There's your branding. A Loom branded Loom. Wouldn't that be wonderful?
3557980	3559980	What's this made out of, Rob?
3559980	3561980	I don't know. Glass.
3561980	3564980	Let's see. The ferret's in a box where it belongs.
3564980	3566980	No!
3566980	3571980	What other old, besides Civilization, just because that's my favorite PC game of all time.
3571980	3573980	Descent. Completely redone.
3573980	3576980	Descent. That would be kind of cool.
3576980	3579980	Like, I'm trying to think of games that would make good multiplayer games.
3579980	3580980	Descent.
3580980	3582980	I remember that from my younger days.
3582980	3584980	Modem Wars. Redneck Rampage.
3584980	3585980	Yeah!
3585980	3587980	Carmageddon.
3587980	3590980	I went Jess Jackrabbit or Commander Keen. Anyone else play those?
3590980	3591980	What? Commander Keen?
3591980	3592980	Commander Keen, yeah.
3592980	3593980	Or Jess Jackrabbit?
3593980	3595980	I think Jess Jackrabbit.
3595980	3597980	Was Jill of the Jungle? Hell yeah.
3597980	3600980	Or ZZT while we're at it, although I don't think that would really work.
3600980	3601980	ZZT.
3601980	3602980	That wouldn't work on Xbox 360, I don't think.
3602980	3603980	We need Gemstone!
3603980	3604980	ZZT for the win.
3604980	3606980	How's that for your MMO?
3606980	3608980	You actually played ZZT? It's been years since I played that game.
3608980	3612980	We need, like, the old text-based MMOs.
3612980	3614980	Yes, I went Zork on Xbox Live Arcade.
3614980	3620980	You saw the page that's a 404 error that's Zork, right?
3620980	3622980	Yeah, I've seen that. That's great.
3622980	3625980	Enter room. You can't enter room.
3625980	3629980	Did you ever play the Crimson Room game?
3629980	3630980	Mm-mm.
3630980	3632980	It was, um, it's a Flash game.
3632980	3634980	They need those type of games on Xbox Live Arcade.
3634980	3637980	How about Oregon Trail on Xbox Live Arcade?
3637980	3639980	There's number munchers for that.
3639980	3640980	That'd be pretty rad.
3640980	3644980	We were talking about Oregon Trail, Rob.
3644980	3647980	At, um, at Pina Gogo. Not Pina Gogo, that's the old one.
3647980	3648980	At California Extreme.
3648980	3649980	Yeah?
3649980	3653980	It was me and Julie and Dan and Mel and Melody at the Ben and Jerry's.
3653980	3656980	Talking about Oregon Trail and all those.
3656980	3659980	And, um, we were talking about our favorite old games.
3659980	3661980	Reliving Diphtheria over and over again.
3661980	3664980	I was like, dude, Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?
3664980	3667980	There you go. There's another great Xbox Live potential. I don't know.
3667980	3669980	Where in Time, specifically.
3669980	3671980	Now we're just naming random shit.
3671980	3674980	No, I'm not. I'm serious. I want that game again.
3674980	3676980	I was good at it, too.
3676980	3678980	Well, Rob D., let me ask you. Oh, thank you.
3678980	3680980	Shadow Charlie in chat says Heretic. Yes, we need that game.
3680980	3682980	Monkeys Island. No, we just need Hexen.
3682980	3685980	Rob D., what would you want?
3685980	3689980	X-Wing and X-Wing Commander Keen and, well, actually, just X-Wing and Jazz Jack
3689980	3691980	would be the two that I could think of.
3691980	3693980	Just because those had multiplayer in there already
3693980	3696980	that would translate perfectly to Xbox Live or Cade.
3696980	3697980	How about One Must Fall?
3697980	3699980	Phantasmagoria.
3699980	3700980	Can you do?
3700980	3702980	No, seriously, Phantasmagoria.
3702980	3705980	Phantasmagoria was huge. It was like seven CDs, wasn't it?
3705980	3707980	It could fit.
3707980	3708980	It's old now.
3708980	3713980	Well, Rob D., thank you for the conversation about good PC gaming retro goodness.
3713980	3715980	We've got to let you go and wrap up the show.
3715980	3716980	No problem. See you guys later.
3716980	3718980	All right, take care, buddy. Bye-bye.
3718980	3720980	All right, well, that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.
3720980	3722980	Thanks so much to those that called in
3722980	3724980	and sorry to those that didn't get through,
3724980	3727980	but if we took any more calls, then Loki's last-minute stories might get spoiled.
3727980	3731980	So, Loki, if you have any last-minute stories, please, now's the time.
3731980	3733980	Anyways, let's see.
3733980	3738980	Duke Nuke with 3D is waiting for the Microsoft's Xbox Live arcade go-ahead,
3738980	3741980	so I'm going to remove that.
3741980	3746980	Okay, and BioShock on the marketplace. Bye-bye.
3746980	3748980	Let's see here. Oh, yeah.
3748980	3756980	There is apparently a TIFF exploit now in the PlayStation 3 firmware, 1.81,
3756980	3763980	and they've gotten apparently a backup of a PlayStation 1 game to run on it.
3763980	3764980	Yay.
3764980	3765980	What game?
3765980	3766980	I don't know.
3766980	3770980	And then also a Hello World little demo thing.
3770980	3772980	Sorry, it was Crash Bandicoot Crash Party.
3772980	3777980	Therefore, this thing has no usefulness whatsoever
3777980	3778980	because nobody wants to play that fucking game.
3778980	3779980	It was Pandemonium.
3779980	3780980	Pandemonium.
3780980	3782980	It was Devil Ties. Enjoy.
3782980	3788980	And then I'm going to say this heavily erring on the rumor aspect,
3788980	3792980	but apparently some random GameStop employee said,
3792980	3799980	Hey, there's going to be an Xbox 360 Ultimate with an HDMI port and HD DVD drive
3799980	3801980	because if he's saying it, oh, it's got to be true.
3801980	3802980	It must be true.
3802980	3805980	Why is that even being reported on the site anywhere?
3805980	3809980	Because this one website likes to report complete rumor stories like that.
3809980	3813980	Then again, we ran the Sega list, but only because somebody submitted it.
3813980	3814980	And because I wanted it to be true.
3814980	3819980	Yeah, we just wanted it to be true.
3819980	3823980	All right, anyhow, I have one other last minute story here
3823980	3825980	coming out of Anderson, South Carolina.
3825980	3828980	Thanks, TigerClaw, for sending me the link because I think this is all kinds of funny.
3828980	3830980	This actually happened at a Toys R Us.
3830980	3833980	There was a 13-year-old PlayStation hater at the store.
3833980	3836980	Unfortunately, we don't know his name because of those laws that protect children.
3836980	3840980	But what he did, he used a permanent black marker to write,
3840980	3847980	PS3 sucks on 23 plastic security cases used to protect Sony PlayStation games from being stolen.
3847980	3849980	Of course, the Toys R Us employees caught him.
3849980	3851980	He was held until police arrived.
3851980	3856980	His parents were not able to be reached, so he was taken to child services.
3856980	3860980	When he was asked why he did it by the police, he said, quote,
3860980	3863980	I have an Xbox and I hate PlayStation.
3863980	3868980	I found the marker lying on the shelf and I guess I was bored. Sorry.
3868980	3870980	That's fantastic.
3870980	3871980	I guess I was bored.
3871980	3874980	I find it even better they couldn't find the stupid parents.
3874980	3876980	He was completely unsupervised.
3876980	3878980	Well, they were off doing crack, of course.
3878980	3879980	And poorly raised.
3879980	3881980	They were off, you know, doing crack.
3881980	3885980	They should be spayed and neutered.
3885980	3888980	Remember, spay and neuter your humans.
3888980	3892980	Did you check the Olive Garden?
3892980	3893980	All right.
3893980	3894980	That's it.
3894980	3898980	Do you have anything, Loki?
3898980	3904980	No, but I wanted to see some of the stuff for Supernova 2.
3904980	3908980	I guess I'll have to get the PlayStation 2 game.
3908980	3910980	Key word is get.
3910980	3914980	DJ Kipples and Bits says, I guess he didn't have enough games to play on his 360.
3914980	3916980	Damn the summer game drought.
3916980	3920980	No, no, you're heaven mistaken with the PlayStation 3.
3920980	3921980	Or the Wii.
3921980	3922980	Christ.
3922980	3923980	Well, there's plenty of games on the Wii.
3923980	3925980	It's just none of them are any good.
3925980	3928980	By the way, and I don't know how this story did not make tonight's show roll,
3928980	3931980	but I swear to God I saw a story on it somewhere.
3931980	3935980	Dark Soccer, they have officially announced they're making a Cooking Mama 2.
3935980	3936980	Squeeze.
3936980	3937980	Oh, that's right, because I didn't care.
3937980	3941980	That's why I wasn't on the show roll, because I was like, oh, Cooking Mama 2.
3941980	3942980	Don't care.
3942980	3945980	I still need to borrow yours, Rob, on the Wii.
3945980	3946980	I ain't playing it.
3946980	3949980	Yeah, Cooking Mama 2 in early 2008.
3949980	3953980	505 Games has entered into agreement with Cooking Mama Limited
3953980	3958980	to deliver Cooking Mama 2 for the DS and the Wii across Europe in early 2008.
3958980	3960980	So I imagine it's just a matter of time.
3960980	3964980	I want it to be like a story-based game where, like,
3964980	3967980	you know, Cooking Mama's relative accidentally murders somebody
3967980	3972980	and they have to dispose of the body in, you know, creative culinary ways.
3972980	3974980	I think that would be pretty cool.
3974980	3977980	Mama will fix it.
3977980	3981980	You know, Cooking Mama, I don't know.
3981980	3983980	Cooking Mama Massacre.
3983980	3984980	Mafia.
3984980	3985980	Cooking Mama Vice City.
3985980	3987980	Cooking Mama Mafia Story.
3987980	3991980	No, it's Murdering Mama.
3991980	3992980	Mama Fix Everything.
3992980	3994980	Cooking Mama Soylent Green.
3994980	3997980	It's people.
3997980	3998980	No.
3998980	3999980	All right.
3999980	4001980	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought
4001980	4003980	because we're about to wrap up the show.
4003980	4004980	So final thoughts.
4004980	4005980	Loki, your final thought.
4005980	4010980	My final thought is game publishers are coming out in a few weeks
4010980	4012980	and that makes me happy.
4012980	4016980	And my final thought is I still hate macaroni and cheese
4016980	4017980	with the powdered cheese.
4017980	4018980	I love the powdered cheese.
4018980	4020980	Cheese should not be in powder form.
4020980	4022980	That's disgusting.
4022980	4027980	Dark Soccer, your final thought.
4027980	4029980	That was it?
4029980	4030980	Freaking cookies.
4030980	4031980	Cookies are great.
4031980	4032980	You know, I have more cookie dough.
4032980	4033980	I should make more cookies.
4033980	4034980	Let's just eat the cookie dough, Rob.
4034980	4035980	No, that's disgusting.
4035980	4036980	No, it's not.
4036980	4037980	It's great.
4037980	4038980	You can get sick because of the raw eggs.
4038980	4039980	You know what?
4039980	4040980	What?
4040980	4042980	That's really an old wives' tale
4042980	4044980	because I used to work at a cookie place
4044980	4048980	and I used to take home the cookie dough.
4048980	4053980	Just because you didn't get sick does not mean you can't get sick.
4053980	4054980	I know.
4054980	4056980	I have special not getting sick from cookie dough powder.
4056980	4060980	Special butter and sugar mix that protects you from the salmonella.
4060980	4062980	It lines your stomach.
4062980	4065980	Leave it to me to be the first person to die from eating cookie dough.
4065980	4066980	All right.
4066980	4069980	We're going to wrap it up, you guys, and call it a week.
4069980	4072980	Thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into our podcast
