487	19085	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
19870	27176	And welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 242, this part B, on August 12th, 2007.
27536	30479	Of course, we do tape live on Sunday nights at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
30759	36103	And we have a chat room full of folks who are chatting about what we were talking about during the bonus segment, which is for the live-only folks.
36604	43970	We were talking about possibly creating a fighting game that would be like Capcom versus SNK, except it would be Orange Lounge Radio versus All Games Interactive.
44270	46272	And I think the results there would be hilarious, so...
47572	54134	We'll have to talk more about that, maybe make a thread in the forums and see if all games would want to get some of their talented artists and game designers in on it too.
54534	56915	Just do it in one of those create-your-own-fighting-game programs.
56935	57895	I think it would be hilarious.
58315	60056	A lot of people would enjoy that.
60076	65338	Meanwhile, let's get back into the gaming news and talk about the real console gaming news out there.
65558	67258	I believe Loki's going to start us off this segment.
67578	72340	Yes, apparently there's a rumor going around that Sony is going to acquire Rockstar Games.
72560	72860	Yes.
73959	84262	I guess this would be good for Sony since they need more first party games and definitely having the Grand Theft Auto franchise to themselves would be pretty good.
86083	87143	Although, I don't know.
87704	103409	Apparently various sources of the press and I guess development team are saying that Sony is looking to take Rockstar under their wings and I know that they have LA Knorr coming out for the Playstation 3 exclusively in the spring so
104562	105003	I don't know.
105123	120821	They're saying also, I guess, there's going to be another exclusive game afterwards, but I can't help but think there may be some exclusive games for Sony, but I doubt that they're actually going to be bought up by Sony, because they're making money hand over fist, so...
122540	124701	They'd be so stupid to cut out the Xbox 360.
124941	128263	Doesn't it seem like this story is somewhat like jumping to conclusions?
128323	139409	Like that's the feeling I got when I read it is that, oh, well, Rockstar has been working a lot with Sony, and now they're doing this exclusive thing for Sony, so therefore Sony's going to be buying Rockstar.
140450	141730	I don't think – I mean, think about it.
141770	148654	I mean, why would they say – I mean, I guess if they're part of Sony, it doesn't matter that they're not selling as many units, but –
149585	154008	They're not exactly suffering or struggling financially, I think.
154028	164275	I mean, granted, Grand Theft Auto 4 being delayed is not helpful or all the lawsuits, but shit, when that game comes out, they're not going to be struggling financially.
164415	168518	Some healthy skepticism courtesy of the chat room as well.
168598	171380	Frisbee says, not going to happen without a big fight.
172060	175102	Ross Steel UT says, Microsoft just paid them $50 million.
175142	175963	It's not going to happen.
176623	178305	Yeah, perfect example.
178465	178885	There you go.
179451	179791	PSP Tube
203072	203513	DarkSakura.com
214830	215730	Look at more information.
215750	222034	But basically, you have to make a developer ID and put it in this file, and then it's kind of a bunch of crap you have to do.
222354	231779	But they also just released another new version of it that's supposed to have a favorites folder and stuff like that that you can download videos and stuff from there.
232299	236521	And unlike, sure, you could do this probably through the web browser as well, but...
237302	239784	This is actually streaming videos straight off YouTube.
239804	242905	This isn't just viewing them off of a web page or anything.
243526	245127	So I guess it's a little bit better.
245687	247428	SSJ100Matt has a good thought here.
247528	252951	How long until PSP OrnoTube or PSP YouPorn or PSP XTube?
253211	254332	It's just a matter of time, right?
254352	255453	I hope.
255473	257874	Because that's what people really want to do on their PSP.
257934	259475	And they get the XXXbox.
260576	260796	Boo!
261716	261857	Boo!
264062	265063	I wanted a cookie, Rob.
265183	269666	The brand new bad joke mistress of Orange Lounge Radio, DarkSakura.
269746	270286	No, no, no.
270406	272327	I was emulating Junami.
272808	273428	I did buy that.
273828	280693	I bought an 160 gig external hard drive for videos on either the 360 or PS3.
280733	284956	Alright, I will go get Jamie a cookie while she reads the next story.
284976	285976	There's one cookie left.
287057	291780	Well, for anybody who actually gives a crap about this game, and also since it's a
292341	294322	A UK release that I'm referring to.
295503	303767	It was slipped during a press conference that, well, Activision UK is only confirming winter.
304548	314533	However, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare has been given the date of November 9th for Europe on PS3, PC, and Xbox 360.
315073	317795	So you can have fun shooting down people if you want to.
318135	318455	Enjoy.
319119	325304	And I think that's about the same time as the one in the US is coming out, so it's not a huge surprise that they're releasing around that same time.
326465	329107	Obviously, extremely awesome game.
329648	335973	I mean, the video that they've been showing so far, very early, but very fucking awesome.
337354	338115	That's your kind of game.
339175	339596	I think so.
340677	347002	The other thing that's kind of interesting, there's a whole PlayStation Starter Pack that was going on in the UK recently,
347628	375796	apparently it was one where they were actually offering the 60 gig system with resistance and motor storm and two controllers for a set amount now the problem is that there's conflicting sources saying that the starter pack might actually be in jeopardy that they might be done with it in August 31st so much like you know the limited price point drop for the 60 gig system and that is
376206	376626	Manhunt 2 Manhunt 2
404344	407049	Rockstar Games is currently appealing the decision.
416426	427334	and there was actually an associate at game specialist law firm Osborne Clark said something about how it may be a while before this decision has the possibility to be overturned.
428194	432157	Last time this happened with Carmageddon, the appeal worked so that's a positive precedent.
432557	437521	Rockstar has taken a while to build its case so they've obviously been taking stock of what the BBFC have said.
437881	440763	They'll have to work together to agree on making the right cuts.
441263	447327	So it is possible that the BBFC could reconsider, but we won't find out for quite a long time.
448508	461257	Also, something to think about is that, quote, if the BBC feels that the violence running throughout the game is too much, it's not like a film where you can just cut out certain scenes, as of course a lot of people said when the story first hit the internet, when the game was first banned.
461857	462958	No, I'm really disappointed.
462978	467201	I can understand why they would want to censor it and stuff so that it can be released and
468280	469361	I wish all this talk would just...
490760	504209	I just wish all this talk would go away and I wish they could just release the damn thing with an adults-only rating and everybody didn't have a collective thumb up their butt about how having adults-only games on their platforms are going to corrupt children across America.
504229	510913	Sony needs to go and say, hey, we'll accept adult-only games.
511373	516116	Go ahead and bring it out on the PlayStation 2 and PS3 exclusively.
516276	516716	There you go.
516736	519198	A little bit of an edge for them.
519525	521287	All right, well, we shall see what happens.
521327	524650	I'm sure this won't be the last time you hear about Manhunt 2, like it or not.
525490	528373	Well, this is actually pretty cool.
528733	535439	A business called Omega Sector opened in Birmingham, of course, in Europe.
537461	538602	Not the Birmingham in Alabama.
539002	540123	No, but I've been there.
540624	541704	I've been there lots of times.
541865	542525	It's not fun.
543166	544447	Sorry, people in Alabama.
546104	551065	But this is a place that has 400 custom-built PCs.
551785	568309	It's 22,000 square feet, two floors, it has an internet cafe, movies, a room for Xbox 360 gaming, sponsored by Squeenix, THQ, Activision, and they've all got their own little places to play at.
568389	575231	You can play Final Fantasy XI, Call of Duty, Shadow of Chernobyl, Stalker, and...
576559	579160	It's just a big, massive gaming spot.
580000	583601	And so it's open for business.
584261	588143	Someday when I become rich, I will open something like that and call it the Orange Lounge.
588223	590143	But that's pretty cool, though.
590283	597485	Well, there's two mobile Omega sectors that will come and do parties and concerts and things like that.
598726	600206	But this is kind of cool.
600286	602307	You pay five pounds to get in.
603317	605919	And then you can go around.
605959	607900	There's promo stuff everywhere.
609361	613163	You could basically not just go into play.
613203	616004	You've got stuff for actually interacting with people.
616285	617085	So that's kind of cool.
619526	622988	We need one next door.
623129	623629	In the backyard.
624509	625550	Yes, in the backyard.
625710	628031	You know, I do have that shed I'm not really using for anything else.
628091	629512	So let's install one of these in there.
630833	632374	Even though there's no air conditioning in there.
633206	634026	We'd probably melt.
635347	648850	You know, there's some interesting news coming out about a violent game law in California that would have restricted anyone under the age of 18 from buying or renting violent video games.
650510	654671	I didn't even know that was in the works, which is interesting.
654691	656592	Well, I'm sure we talked about it previously on the show.
656772	657232	I know we did.
657652	660693	Well, there's been so many states, you know, I just can't keep track of them.
661173	661413	True.
661913	661973	Uh,
662532	671503	Anyway, so the bill signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger back in 2005, it's been overturned.
673366	676069	So that's interesting because, of course, it was unconstitutional.
677028	677808	Yada, yada, yada.
677848	681629	Pretty much the same thing that every single state so far has found out.
681989	683789	You know, it was a while ago when this happened.
683809	685930	I think this was back when we were doing the To Go show.
685970	688190	We were doing the separate shows when this first went through.
688210	689271	I think that's why you forgot about it.
689291	696492	Because I remember that guy, Leland Yee, they were parading him amongst all the game blogs and some of the shows on TV and how he wrote this bill and everything.
696512	704754	And to his credit, even if we may not agree with his law personally, he was at least willing to chat with the game sites and the blogs and stuff.
704774	704854	Yeah.
705474	708315	Well, the thing and problem is it's in violent video games.
708355	710536	And, of course, what is violent?
711237	711897	That's the problem.
711937	717679	It wasn't like adult-only games or mature-rated games cannot be sold to these people.
717719	718460	That's right.
718480	720861	If they had done something like that, then that would have been a little different.
722902	723242	I don't know.
723262	730265	I think it's stupid that they're having laws for that since they don't have laws for that for movies or music or anything like that.
730285	730685	Yeah.
731610	732891	So what happens now?
732951	733812	Is it gone forever?
733892	734492	Is it going to go away?
734652	735113	No, of course not.
735153	736113	Never hear about it again?
736254	743539	Of course not, because when it was deemed unconstitutional, Governor Schwarzenegger says, well, it will be back.
744800	745821	Pun intended, of course.
746641	752226	And he says he isn't done protecting the bill's targeted youth.
753226	757229	Thank you, Schwarzenegger, for saving our kids with censorship.
758130	759211	Thank you very much.
760100	771066	Especially since, um... Yeah, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Schwarzenegger, like, you know, not only star in, but give some money to the Terminator 3 project, which was an R-rated movie that I'm sure many kids snuck into?
771246	772287	I mean, hello.
772607	779691	Or Terminator 2, or Total Recall, I mean, the chick had three boobs, I mean, what kid is not gonna, you know, try to sneak into a movie like that?
779751	780392	I mean, come on.
780612	781592	Where a chick has three boobs?
781612	782053	Exactly.
782093	782673	Exactly.
783846	792928	Alright, well, anyhow, you know, news of these laws not going away and just the fact that here we go again makes us very angsty.
793028	794708	So, of course, you know what that means.
795208	799169	It's time to make our own violence here on the program with our segment called the FUs of the Week.
809811	811191	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
812518	817079	My FU of the week goes towards people who don't know when to shut up.
818739	822740	People who have to get the last word, who must always be right.
824060	833122	People who don't understand when it's better to let things lie than to prolong a bad situation.
836023	836543	FU to that.
840049	842251	Loki, alright, my F.E.
842271	845814	goes to this chair that I'm sitting in because it's horribly uncomfortable.
846855	852119	It's hard, the back of it's like super stiff, like I feel like my spine is being readjusted.
853300	853781	Not good.
854942	855622	And then also F.E.
855642	857064	to my computer for resetting.
857464	861427	I reinstalled Windows with Service Pack 2 now.
861567	865631	Not only is my internet slower thanks to that, but I did kind of try to fix that.
866467	867828	It's still resetting randomly.
868108	869889	I just think the motherboard's crapping out.
870089	871830	It's kind of old.
872590	873931	Need to build a new computer.
875592	875972	That's it.
877593	880795	My review of the week goes to Comcast for reasons previously mentioned.
880875	885797	I mean, just the fact that they completely were fucking up our order made us wait so long to get the freaking internet here.
885857	891320	And then, you know, just we were sitting around the whole day and offered practically no compensation for it.
891380	893461	So they suck big floppy donkey dick.
893662	894322	So that's it.
896618	897379	Thank you for watching!
915854	923801	Well, Spore didn't show up at E3, but Spore will be showing up at the Leipzig Convention in Germany.
924721	928384	It's going to be actually playable behind closed doors.
928725	933608	Now, of course, I wonder if that means, okay, is it like last year's E3 where it's going to be playable by somebody else?
934189	937592	Or will select lucky few people actually get to play it?
938152	940374	Supposedly, Spore is still on track for a 2008 release, but...
942392	948435	I think most people would agree they will release it when it's damn good and ready and they're going to take their sweet ass time to make sure it's right.
948895	949635	So let's hope so.
950116	950796	Let's hope it's right.
950836	959780	But keep your eye on your favorite game blogs from August 23rd to 26th when the Leipzig Games Convention is going on because that's when you're likely to see some news on this.
959920	962501	You see really what's happening though is the game is done.
962641	970745	Right now they're just working on emptying Scrooge McDuck's vault so they can stick all the money in there that they're going to make on this game.
971650	972410	That's what they're doing.
972570	973751	Are they gonna go swimming in it?
975812	976812	And they will go swimming in it.
977212	977492	What?
978413	980293	They're gonna make tons of money off this thing.
980313	980874	That's what it is.
981074	983215	Stop fucking making playable demos.
983315	986576	I mean, that's all they're working on is goddamn playable demos for these stupid events.
986796	988197	Just finish the fucking game.
990097	991418	They're just trying to tease you.
991458	993479	Then you'll make the money to go in the vault.
993519	994619	They want you teased.
994999	995740	Then you'll be able to swim in it.
995800	998921	I just think it's very random that you brought up Scrooge McDuck's vault.
999642	1001204	I think that that's appropriate.
1001344	1006950	By the way, dear Capcom, Capcom, yeah, where the fuck is DuckTales 3?
1007851	1008933	Why didn't we ever get that?
1009213	1010655	Maybe because DuckTales is off the air?
1013089	1013629	Who cares?
1013890	1015871	It's all about the DuckTales moon level.
1016431	1016872	I know for real.
1016892	1018112	The best music ever.
1018393	1019053	DuckTales.
1019613	1022756	What kid that grew up in the 80s doesn't remember the DuckTales video game?
1023076	1023576	DuckTales 2.
1024036	1027959	Who cares that it didn't sell at all because it was released towards the end of the NES lifespan.
1027999	1031061	Like every kid had upgraded to a Super Nintendo at that point.
1031381	1032362	So where is DuckTales 3?
1033783	1034904	Couldn't it be done on the DS?
1036785	1037285	What?
1037405	1039287	Did Capcom lose the license or something?
1039607	1041148	It's not on the air anymore!
1041721	1043121	They're hanging out with Duke Nukem.
1043442	1044182	Who cares?
1044502	1045402	Look at Kingdom Hearts.
1045462	1047883	Scrooge McDuck's in Kingdom Hearts and so is Huey, Dewey, and Louie.
1047903	1055365	But that's also got a lot of the more modern... Even Tron is in Kingdom Hearts 2, which makes me happy.
1055385	1058826	But you remember, though, those characters were not only on DuckTales.
1058906	1063407	They actually existed in other cartoon shorts before DuckTales.
1063668	1065808	I don't really give a shit who makes the DuckTales game.
1065908	1067509	I just want one and I want it to not suck.
1068049	1068549	Make it yourself.
1068922	1071785	They can maybe do a DuckTales level in Kingdom Hearts 3.
1072225	1074027	Maybe a Darkwing Duck level.
1074047	1077171	Supposedly, Kingdom Hearts 3 is not Kingdom Hearts 3.
1077651	1079093	Kingdom Hearts 3.5.
1079213	1081695	Kingdom Hearts 2, another game, you know.
1082356	1084078	Like they do 2-2 or something.
1084098	1085880	I don't know.
1086080	1086140	Ugh.
1087746	1090328	Rosteel UT says Kingdom Hearts has shit from the 50s in it.
1090548	1092290	Or even earlier than that.
1092330	1094071	They have the Steamboat Willie level.
1094091	1096553	Yeah, they have the Timeless River or whatever that level is called.
1096573	1097333	That level is awesome.
1097353	1098834	The Steamboat Willie level.
1099255	1103077	But that's like classic Disney.
1103738	1107060	It's not like they don't have a tailspin level.
1108321	1109202	Baloo is not wearing...
1110017	1112638	That's because Tailspin is rip off of the Jungle Book.
1112678	1115739	You do get one Gummy Bears reference, which is pretty awesome.
1116479	1117540	With a gummy ship, right?
1117760	1119580	That's not really the Gummy Bears, though.
1119801	1122001	But that's what I like to think in my own mind.
1122502	1123682	It's a Gummy Bears reference.
1123702	1126543	The thing has absolutely nothing to do with Gummy Bears.
1126723	1127323	Shut up!
1128624	1129764	But we've got our poo level.
1129964	1131805	And I hate the poo levels because they're not all that fun.
1132253	1137738	Where's my, you know, level based on Swiss Family Robinson or 2000 Leagues Under the Sea?
1137758	1138798	Remember the Treehouse is gone.
1138918	1140540	Where's the Herbie Lovebug level?
1141360	1144983	Dude, they need to have Bruce Campbell in that one, too, because Bruce Campbell is in a Herbie movie.
1145404	1146365	Or what was the dog?
1146685	1147926	Not Old Yeller, but the other one.
1147986	1149327	Shaggy the Dog or whatever it was?
1149347	1149507	No.
1149527	1150188	The Shaggy Dog?
1150228	1151269	The Shaggy Dog, that's it.
1151489	1153370	That darn cat blood.
1153871	1155432	Or what about the Witch Mountain movies?
1156989	1157789	I love those.
1157889	1158649	Now we're getting random.
1158769	1160230	Let's please go to another story.
1160310	1167571	Speaking of random, actually not really, there are new Wii Virtual Console stuff rated out now.
1168432	1170272	Thank you, ESRB, you bastards.
1171652	1173353	Thank you, you bastards.
1174053	1174853	I love that.
1175453	1178774	Well, what games are they, oh faithful news reporter?
1178794	1182455	We have Landstalker, The Treasures of King Noel.
1183255	1184055	I never played that.
1184395	1185876	I've never even fucking heard of that game.
1186097	1188018	Shinobi 3, Return of the Ninja Master.
1188078	1189840	I'm sorry, Shadow Dancer was better.
1191101	1193283	Shadow Dancer is the best Shinobi game ever.
1193303	1193743	And?
1194984	1195865	And Ghouls and Ghosts.
1196405	1197366	Okay, well that's alright.
1199268	1203512	Wow, they're really getting obscure on some of these Genesis and TurboGrafx titles that are coming out.
1204573	1207055	And yet we still don't have Guardian Lession, speaking of obscure.
1207075	1207295	I know!
1208018	1211720	Why don't you have, like, Metal Gear on Virtual Console?
1212600	1215401	Where are some of the other old Konami classics besides Dyskrabius?
1215421	1223024	Well, you know, there's a good point that they make here that just because it's rated doesn't mean it's going to come out.
1224785	1226025	So, who knows?
1226085	1228646	Like, what the fuck, Landstalker, whatever.
1230187	1232888	You know, they should let me pick games for the Virtual Console.
1233228	1235389	Because I'd put Panorama Cotton all up in there.
1235409	1237490	I would too.
1238140	1240302	Ross Steel UT makes fun of what Jamie said.
1240342	1241182	Thank you, you bastards.
1241803	1245546	Ross Steel UT says, I'm very gracious, you retarded spastic fags.
1248968	1259757	You know, it's like, if I were to pick games for their virtual console, I would be just like, well, how about we pick the one where you fix the fucking internet thing and make it so it's actually, you know...
1260680	1262622	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1282558	1283899	The Goonies, not The Goonies 2.
1284699	1286019	No, we need Goonies 2 as well.
1286319	1289340	Well, we need that eventually, but we need the first one that came out.
1289500	1291121	I'm saying, where's all the Konami stuff?
1291321	1292101	Yes, there was.
1292301	1294062	Yeah, there was, but only in Japan, I think.
1294182	1301444	And it had an arcade release that was one of those timed Nintendo crappy games that, you know, like they had the Super Mario Bros.
1301524	1303585	one where all your enemies are beetle bugs.
1303685	1307967	All right, let's get past that quintessential games we want on virtual console stuff.
1307987	1308847	Get back into some news.
1309648	1320495	All right, well, it's very unfortunate that this super awesome game is only exclusive at Walmart, but Chibi-Robo DS, people thought that it might have been scrapped at first, but guess what?
1320596	1325119	Walmart's going to have the exclusive rights to this super awesome game.
1325699	1327180	No, really, it really, really sucks.
1327340	1328861	It was a horrible game, played at E3.
1329001	1332303	Well, the GameCube one was kind of shitty, too.
1332624	1334385	Well, let me put it this way, the DS...
1334884	1337325	Captures the essence of the GameCube game perfectly.
1338746	1343327	So yay, Chibi-Robo Park Patrol will launch October 2nd at Walmart.
1343367	1344188	So you know what?
1344488	1348129	And Walmart is releasing it in a limited edition baby shit green case.
1348589	1348929	Who knew?
1350250	1351610	Oh wait, that's not the case.
1351690	1352931	That's actually baby shit.
1357263	1368088	DreamKitty.com is offering these very cute little overlays for your Nintendo DS.
1368608	1370609	They're Hello Kitty overlays!
1370709	1371330	That's right.
1371710	1376792	You could take your pink DS Lite and make it pinker with new Hello Kitty overlays.
1377252	1378173	And it looks like...
1378733	1382656	It looks like bling a little bit, like they have gemstones on it, but that's the little pattern.
1382676	1385838	They have a little kitty thing on the front, and then little kitty designs.
1386058	1388140	Actually, there's really not any kitties inside.
1388200	1391062	It's all like flowers and gems and all sorts of other girly shit.
1391662	1395265	I'm surprised they're not selling this at the Sanrio store.
1395605	1398567	$16.49 plus shipping if you would like to buy this at DreamKitty.com.
1399168	1402030	And I know I want it, so we'll see.
1402555	1403916	I'm seriously considering buying it.
1403936	1404496	How cool would that be?
1404516	1406657	And as the article says, go for it.
1407278	1410319	You'll sure be the envy of every 10-year-old girl on the block.
1410719	1411060	I know.
1411300	1412500	There you go, Rob.
1412520	1413081	Well, hold on.
1413181	1418803	When people come into the house and they see my Hello Kitty toaster and my Hello Kitty coffee maker, it always gets a comment.
1419724	1420404	Wow, he's crazy.
1420504	1421485	Oh, my God, you bought that?
1423586	1426327	No, mostly it's been, oh, my gosh, my daughter would love that.
1429549	1430009	All right, anyway.
1431795	1435857	Let's open up the mailbag and get a little serious here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1436258	1439680	And open up ye olde mailbag and see what you guys, listeners, have to say.
1440020	1443762	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place you can always send those emails to.
1444122	1447745	And DarkSakura is going to dive on in and pull out some of her favorite emails.
1447945	1448885	So here she goes.
1455589	1458111	The first of three emails that I'm going to read.
1459915	1464118	Hey, OLR guys, not sure if this question has been covered before, but if it has, sorry about that.
1464258	1465118	Okay, we forgive you.
1465238	1465819	Next email.
1466939	1471462	Sites such as BinMoneyStyle.com and its message board cater to BinMoney players mainly in the U.S.
1471502	1472443	with an English language.
1472823	1477385	GameFacts.com is another major site with a large message board that deals with all sorts of video games.
1478546	1481848	It is another site with a user base dominantly from the U.S.
1481868	1482669	that speaks English.
1483769	1488552	Using those two sites as an example and excluding 2chan from the answer.
1489278	1500366	What is one Bimani site from Japan and one major video game and general site from Japan that caters to players from the Japanese region with a fully functional message board and a user base from the same region?
1500986	1509533	I ask this because we don't hear much from these sites and they don't get much recognition for being a major thriving site outside of Japan.
1510333	1511354	Thanks, Snaps.
1512435	1513836	Well, first of all, I don't
1516147	1521530	I think that I'm the only person in this room that really reads much Japanese and that's maybe 30 kanji if I'm lucky.
1522331	1526313	So we typically don't go to those sites given that we can't reliably read them.
1526838	1530419	and that nifty Global Gate doesn't always translate quite right.
1530759	1533920	Yeah, unfortunately, I don't have a lot to give you there for the same reason.
1533940	1537080	Like, I don't speak Japanese, so going to those sites doesn't do me a lot of good.
1537160	1538381	But I can give you this.
1538401	1539141	It's Aaron in Japan.
1539401	1540201	There is a site.
1540221	1546662	Well, actually, outside of that, I can give you one site that's all in Japanese as far as the what is a good Bimani site with boards to look at.
1546962	1549823	And that would be a website called Mia's Another Leaf.
1550203	1576162	and that site is mieya.cool.ne.jp and I first discovered this site because they actually have us linked on it and so it came up in the referrer's log and so I checked out the site and they run a fully functional news blog and I'm pretty extensive on the Bomani coverage there and of course they have some DDR characters Alice and Emmy in their logo so you know they've been around a long time the site brags that they've been up since 2001 March 6th of 2001 they've been running so there you go
1579144	1580525	That's a site you can definitely check out.
1580565	1581805	Again, that's Mia's Another Leaf.
1582886	1585827	As far as the more general gaming site, I don't know.
1585867	1586787	Unfortunately, I couldn't tell you.
1587127	1590409	Next time you send us an email, tell us the site you want us to plug, and we'll check it out.
1590449	1593790	General gaming site, I would say probably Famitsu.com.
1593810	1596251	Yeah, there is Famitsu.
1596631	1598332	I'm sure they have forums that go along with it.
1601073	1602013	Alright, next email then.
1602974	1604054	Next email is...
1607725	1608666	There's a sigh.
1608686	1608746	Wow.
1608766	1610588	My cousin is a perfect example.
1610609	1611930	Complete lack of discipline for that kid.
1627142	1630604	Also, I was at the arcade today for some good old-fashioned DDR Max 2.
1631004	1633906	With my luck, there was a party with a bunch of munchkins running around.
1634366	1636487	While I played, this little girl kept asking me for money.
1636847	1637768	Now come on!
1639229	1643191	I was told never to ask strangers for money when I was a kid, and I never did.
1643571	1645492	But yeah, her mother wasn't even around either.
1646052	1647133	Then another kid came up.
1647435	1650477	They started jumping on the arrows behind me while I was selecting a song.
1650897	1653879	I went to move back onto the mat and began to play the song and he almost runs into me.
1653939	1657621	Thank God his mother finally showed up or that kid would have lost a foot had I stepped on it.
1658322	1660463	Ever had this experience at your local arcade with children?
1660483	1661303	Yeah, it sucks.
1661363	1663405	Whatever you do, Jamie, just don't reproduce.
1664165	1667087	You and your husband will live happy lives.
1667787	1668868	Sincerely, Osfer.
1668948	1669368	P.S.
1669689	1671510	I'm not sure if I spelled your name correctly.
1671530	1672450	Feel free to connect me.
1672630	1673971	And Rob spaz your anger.
1674752	1676333	You spelled my name correctly, by the way.
1676593	1676933	Thank you.
1677216	1680237	Well, Ossifer, we'd all like to thank you for the email here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1682478	1683658	And so would all the screaming children.
1685819	1686199	I don't know.
1686319	1687820	I mean, you know, kids are kids.
1689501	1693762	I think kids, when being parented actively, aren't so bad.
1694382	1699844	But unfortunately, at a lot of these types of places, like the Arcade and Chuck E. Cheese, these are places where the parents go to get a break.
1700705	1702385	And they just let their kids run around like crazy.
1702806	1704086	You did it too when you were a kid.
1704986	1705447	No, I didn't.
1705467	1706187	Really?
1706207	1706427	Really?
1706926	1707987	I never ran around crazy.
1708627	1709128	Never ever?
1709508	1710389	In just my backyard.
1710789	1711390	Not in public.
1712130	1714513	I had an all-girl bicycle gang.
1716734	1718396	Wait, you were a member of a bike gang?
1719557	1723640	No, it was four of us and we would ride the streets like we were on patrol.
1724801	1729005	Only I had the best bike of everybody so nobody could keep up with me.
1730326	1733489	I'm fascinated by the fact that you were in a bike gang when you were a little girl.
1735922	1736542	That's amazing.
1736883	1740785	But I wasn't a problem child like that.
1741225	1745507	Keep in mind, if you grow up in the South, your parents don't give a shit about all this PC bullshit.
1745927	1747008	They're just going to discipline you.
1748789	1754311	All that stuff that Bill Ingvall said about going out to the tree and picking your own switch, I did that.
1755292	1757573	That is cruel and unusual punishment.
1758874	1759314	Wowzers.
1760495	1762456	Yeah, I had a birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese.
1762496	1765037	We all ran around like crazy while our parents sat around and gossiped.
1765444	1766204	Well, that's how it worked.
1766805	1773128	I think there's a difference between actually going to an arcade and going to a place where you're expected to be overrun by a bajillion children.
1773148	1778310	At least with an arcade, you expect to have people monitoring their children.
1779071	1780891	Well, look at what's happening in arcades.
1780911	1782532	They're all turning into birthday palaces.
1782552	1790236	Well, at my arcade, when I worked at one, we would not let any child under a particular age
1790626	1792388	This is from Misty.
1812772	1812932	Aw.
1813353	1813733	Hi, Misty.
1814073	1815094	Fuck closing on Sundays.
1815534	1818156	I can't be the only one able to close this night.
1818496	1818616	No.
1819016	1821478	I can't be the only one able to close this night of the week.
1821558	1822278	I miss you guys.
1822438	1822999	Heart, Misty.
1824400	1824520	Aw.
1824600	1825581	That was a short but sweet email.
1826561	1826841	Aw.
1826881	1827742	I miss you, too.
1828422	1828803	Is that it?
1829183	1829763	That's it.
1830163	1830944	We need more emails.
1830984	1833946	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you would like to send us some emails.
1834967	1836347	Give us some more stuff to read next week.
1836408	1839970	Well, before I forget, I did want to say that there's no Pump Up the Volume this week, either.
1840578	1842258	because last week there was a funeral.
1843839	1847120	This week I have a class, so no pump.
1847300	1847540	Sorry.
1847740	1848840	All right.
1848880	1852101	We will have some weeknight shows slowly returning probably after the summer.
1852121	1859402	I know Travis is finally back on Saturdays, and I want to say that DMN said he's doing his thing on Thursdays and whatever.
1859482	1866404	So there's lots of stuff coming up as far as the weeknight shows go, and then Wednesday night should be back pretty soon as well after all this summer craziness has ended.
1867426	1868987	So let's get back into some game news.
1869487	1869868	Loki.
1870488	1871749	Summer craziness.
1872249	1874591	Anyways.
1876172	1878893	I was going to say, there's some interesting things.
1879294	1887239	Not a huge surprise with the day and age that we're living in, but Airport Security is beginning to inspect game consoles.
1888099	1894263	Don't worry, they're not going to break them open to make sure that it's a game console, but they will x-ray them for you.
1895131	1901797	and they probably will, um, I don't think they're going to forbid you from bringing them on the plane, but just so you know, it will be x-rayed.
1903338	1904779	I mean, is anyone surprised?
1905119	1910824	Well, I bring DSs on the plane and they're, you just have to put them on the x-ray belt like anything else, so.
1911144	1912646	Exactly, so, I don't know.
1912706	1918671	Doesn't seem like anything new to me, but I guess maybe the big fat consoles they're doing now, like if you put them in your luggage.
1919171	1922514	Maybe they're like my wife and go, why are you bringing that around?
1923351	1924574	It's on a portable console?
1924594	1925195	What the fuck?
1926137	1928101	Because you're a hardcore nerd?
1928362	1928682	I don't know.
1928983	1929484	Yes.
1929724	1934274	Well, one thing you could bring around with you if you own an iPhone is NES games.
1935858	1938580	New NES Emulator for the iPhone
1959252	1960232	There's no sound.
1960312	1962033	The controls are not that great for right now.
1962093	1964974	But, hey, it's a start, and it shows that it can be done.
1965314	1971195	Now, the first thing you've got to do is, of course, you have to kind of hack your iPhone because of the way you get some of the other stuff on there.
1971575	1972996	But it's possible.
1974156	1974876	It's very possible.
1975616	1976577	Anything is possible.
1978717	1981198	Of course, I don't have an iPhone, so I couldn't tell you for sure.
1981218	1983038	I got to see Melody's iPhone.
1983959	1984259	Oh, yeah?
1984459	1985119	How's she liking that?
1985424	1988627	I heard stories about someone being charged $3,000 for browsing the internet on their iPhone.
1988847	1989128	Oh my lord.
2010126	2013168	No, they have some unlimited service thing, but I don't know.
2013188	2013889	I still don't want one.
2014029	2016231	I want a phone that I can text with.
2016551	2016851	That's it.
2017231	2018913	Yeah, the iPhone's a bit much for me.
2019353	2022856	I want a phone that doesn't shut off randomly.
2023456	2026358	I understand why people are all getting into it, but it's just not for me.
2026579	2027039	Just not for me.
2027559	2027960	You know what?
2028120	2028940	I have a laptop.
2029020	2029641	I'm happy with it.
2031050	2036473	Anyway, there is a little bit of information coming out of the South Park camp.
2037454	2046159	For anyone who is picking up the Season 10 DVD bundle, you get a 14-day trial of World of Warcraft.
2047740	2050862	Which is kind of funny because Season 10 had the Warcraft episode in it, huh?
2051303	2055045	Yeah, but also Blizzard helped them with it, which I thought was funny.
2055939	2056859	Wow.
2058240	2059320	I finally saw the episode.
2059340	2059840	It was funny.
2060320	2075504	I would think that most people who watch South Park have probably already given World of Warcraft a try once in their life, at least.
2076665	2077505	I just thought that was funny.
2077745	2078245	I haven't.
2079362	2081664	You know who I finally got to play World of Warcraft this week?
2081685	2083246	By the way, I heard you're finally back.
2083286	2084347	I saw your post in the forums.
2084647	2089672	Well, yeah, if anyone would actually add my noob character to the guild and give me money.
2089852	2092715	Tell me when you're going to be on next, and I'll send you money and get you in the guild.
2093155	2093476	Okay.
2093896	2095978	And you know who you can play with now who's also a noob?
2097509	2099090	William, the boyfriend, is on.
2099190	2101911	He started playing World of Warcraft because he was such a StarCraft fan.
2102391	2103612	He still plays StarCraft now.
2103632	2106273	It's like the one game he really does play and is really into.
2106833	2111875	And we kind of said, well, if you like that game, why aren't you playing World of Warcraft or some of the other Blizzard titles?
2112195	2113536	So he tried it out and he loved it.
2113696	2114876	So now he's sucked into it too.
2114896	2117858	I play World of Warcraft when there's absolutely nothing else to do.
2119178	2120359	So I play about once a month.
2121819	2122980	But when I play, I play for a while.
2123792	2127296	Stay far away while you still can, because once you get sucked in, it's bad.
2127396	2128297	I won't get sucked in.
2129398	2131901	Even when I played Final Fantasy XI, I didn't get sucked in.
2132522	2133363	That's because you hated it.
2134264	2136327	But I was really good with a controller.
2137170	2140472	Hey, I could do all that macro crap with a controller.
2140672	2141092	That's cool.
2141132	2143113	Hey, you should have been playing on 360 at some point.
2143153	2144474	You saw me do that, too.
2144554	2147335	I know, and I remember commenting, like, wow, how do you do all that shit with a controller?
2147355	2153258	Of course, the game was designed for the PlayStation 2, so it's supposed to be played with a controller, but I would never be able to do it.
2153759	2159081	I actually had a hard time figuring out the macros on my function key, so I was just like, screw it, I'll use my controller.
2159421	2161843	And then I got so pissed off I couldn't play World of Warcraft with a controller.
2161863	2163924	I was like, damn it!
2165284	2165525	Alright.
2166045	2166265	Anyway.
2168337	2188423	Yes, this only could come from Second Life, but apparently there is a virtual sex program made by a company called Eros LLC, and it makes realistic genitalia and creates sexual moves for Second Life citizens.
2189603	2195665	And apparently this one guy who created it found out that his works have been
2196711	2206696	I don't know, it's interesting, the whole sex in Second Life Somebody should sue everybody involved for bringing sex to Second Life, I mean really
2221306	2226347	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2249059	2255165	Well, on to a little bit more serious note and something not often talked about would be the good side of gaming.
2255185	2259630	You know, we hear about all these laws and all these, you know, sex-crazed pervs ruining games.
2259910	2263514	Well, there's some good news about the good of gaming that's going on.
2264014	2272223	And it's actually thanks to Wii Sports, the Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute at Minneapolis' Abbott Northwestern Hospital.
2272783	2277506	actually aids patients who suffered from strokes by letting them play Wii Sports.
2277526	2277846	That's right.
2277886	2280908	It's kind of a little bit of their rehab program.
2281568	2282389	Kind of interesting.
2282489	2283449	Hand-eye coordination.
2283689	2293475	There's actually an article that was ran in a local paper called the Star Tribune that talks about the rehab program and even has a picture of a guy there playing Wii Sports.
2294015	2295236	So kind of cool there.
2296374	2301397	and let's see, a quote here from one of the patients, quote, I'm not a video game player.
2301677	2303158	This is the only one I've ever played.
2303778	2307140	Because of the interaction of the game, I get the physical sensation of playing tennis.
2307460	2308180	It really works.
2308300	2311182	It can fool me into thinking that I'm doing what's happening on the screen.
2312703	2313143	Kind of cool.
2314804	2315264	So that's cool.
2315284	2316544	That's why we play games.
2318385	2319446	So we won't get strokes?
2319586	2321467	I mean, I play games because they're fun.
2321947	2325269	Well, simulation games anyway.
2327130	2332695	Well, I'm glad to see games being used for good and reporting on some of the good stuff about games.
2332855	2333315	So there you go.
2334356	2335197	Of course, I don't know.
2335918	2340041	If these patients are like me, they're going to get bored of Wii Sports in a day or so.
2340562	2341843	But maybe I'm just jaded.
2342824	2344705	I think it's more fun if you've got people there with you.
2345066	2345286	True.
2346907	2354394	At any rate, though, for those who are into simulations, speaking of that type of thing,
2355011	2355571	Well, not really.
2355611	2356352	It's Rock Band.
2356612	2357153	I mean, hey.
2358874	2361756	A price point is released of $199.
2362036	2367360	And if you have an Xbox 360, guess what?
2368361	2369162	No wireless.
2370323	2370963	Screwed.
2372685	2373305	Who cares?
2373405	2374806	Wireless is kind of overrated.
2375327	2376107	Wires are long.
2376287	2377308	Wires can be extended.
2378329	2379110	Wrap up the wires.
2379170	2380070	Stop being so lazy.
2380651	2382132	Is wireless really that big a deal?
2383353	2383833	I guess.
2383853	2384834	Some people think so.
2385148	2391713	Well, especially if you've got the drum hooked up with the wires and the microphone hooked up with the wires, then you're going to have a tripping hazard.
2391913	2392673	All right, I'll give you that.
2392714	2399258	The only issue that this game is going to have with that is not everyone's going to have a USB port hub.
2399578	2405643	And if you're going to try to play four players, you're going to be like, where's the other USB port?
2406243	2409806	So, you know, that's the only issue that this will have.
2410287	2419814	But the reason why I think they're not doing wireless is because, you know, to license the wireless, you know, technology patent or whatever from Microsoft or whatever.
2419834	2423617	Microsoft should just give them a buy on it for this game.
2423657	2424678	Well, look at Guitar Hero.
2424698	2431002	I mean, their guitars are $10 more for the wireless, so... I don't know.
2431983	2432583	Not a big deal, though.
2432884	2433264	But, um...
2433735	2435516	Guitar Hero 2 Guitar Hero 3 Guitar Hero 4 Guitar Hero 5
2458887	2461569	I know it's stupid because I hate Guitar Hero.
2462069	2463731	You won't play it past a day.
2464411	2466213	I give it a day that you're going to play it and that's it.
2466553	2468375	I'm getting... I'm of course going to get the set.
2468915	2470416	Now you might give it two days.
2471337	2472018	No, I...
2473567	2476608	We still play Guitar Hero at my house all the damn time.
2476648	2479008	You and Dan will have fun with that because Dan likes to play guitar, right?
2479028	2480189	And he brings his buddies over.
2480789	2485190	And of course, that's when I go hide because they all get extra manly around each other.
2485370	2485930	Well, that's the thing.
2486490	2488991	I won't buy the game because I'll just go over to Loki's house to play it.
2489131	2489591	Or your house.
2489631	2490571	Come to my house.
2490872	2492712	We still need to play Super Metroid, Rob.
2492812	2493512	Oh, we sure do.
2493872	2494813	Let's do that.
2495413	2495653	Soon.
2496173	2496513	Wednesday.
2497116	2497797	and DarkSakura.
2510620	2512883	Rob and Jamie play something on air.
2513544	2515226	Today we have the Atari 5200.
2515946	2517048	We're playing Kix.
2517428	2520191	But because it's the Atari 5200, none of the controllers work.
2520332	2520672	The end.
2520752	2522794	We could run it through the camera thing.
2522814	2523655	I'll have to show you later.
2523916	2525378	We could put a camera on the TV and do it that way.
2525498	2526078	Let's do that.
2526499	2527160	We'll think about it.
2527220	2527860	I think we can do that.
2527880	2528321	New show.
2528461	2529022	Oh, my God.
2529462	2529743	OMG.
2530768	2531028	All right.
2531428	2531909	Anyhow, sorry.
2531929	2536312	We're going to open up the Skype line very soon, but we've got one more story for you guys before we do that.
2536432	2539113	And, of course, when the Skype line is open, you can give us a call to talk to us.
2539754	2546178	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, or you can actually call us on the real phone, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2547058	2557905	Anyway, so Circuit City isn't too happy with CheapAssGamer because, of course, as you'll remember, there were some – one of their forum posters by the name of Speedy1961 –
2559761	2563863	had leaked the ads from Circuit City to the website.
2564623	2572406	And of course that revealed the price drop information for the PlayStation 3 and none were too happy about that.
2572546	2580929	So they've actually subpoenaed CheapAssGamer to try to find out who the real identity of Speedy1961 is.
2583811	2587212	But of course CheapAssGamer is going to be fighting this because they want to protect
2587660	2589542	The rights of their posters.
2590363	2596748	So it should be interesting.
2597469	2607518	I don't know if it's an employee of any one of those because I think they also had Best Buy and other types of ads leaked as well.
2607858	2608378	Boy oh boy.
2615672	2617433	Yeah, well, I mean, what do you guys think?
2617453	2619694	Do you think they have the right to be putting out the subpoena out there?
2619714	2623675	Or do you think maybe if they wanted to protect the information, they shouldn't have kind of leaked it in the first place?
2624096	2624876	Both, I think.
2624916	2626016	Well, I don't know if they have.
2626036	2631599	I mean, granted, it's, you know, stuff that's not supposed to be out there.
2631879	2633800	So they have the right to protect that.
2634160	2638502	But at the same time, you know, they should be more careful with, you know, information getting leaked.
2638642	2643404	Maybe have more of these people signing, you know, nondisclosure agreements and stuff like that.
2645236	2645556	I don't know.
2646957	2659080	If they are smart, there should be some sort of policy regarding this if it is an employee that's doing that and they should be able to take proper action based on that policy.
2659180	2664342	If they don't have a policy in place for that, then well, you're kind of setting yourself up for trouble.
2665017	2669339	Alright, well you guys can call right now and give us your opinion because the Skype line is open.
2669399	2680084	Again, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio or our 800 number is 1-877-GAME-OLR Skype line is open and we're taking calls so we'll go ahead and go to the first call.
2684045	2685926	At least we're going to try to go to the first call here.
2687447	2688967	I hate this new Skype version.
2689028	2689808	I hate it so much.
2690848	2691949	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2691969	2692309	Who's this?
2693089	2694890	Raven Stolfen, how are you tonight?
2694970	2696551	Hi, fine, thank you, Raven Stolfen.
2696571	2697092	What's on your mind?
2698053	2699273	Two things on my mind.
2699454	2702295	The Bioshock demo is up on Xbox Live.
2702536	2704997	Oh, I heard somebody say that in the chat room during the show.
2705017	2706979	I was saving it for the last minute story, but yeah.
2707159	2708080	All right, well, that's all right.
2708780	2710081	Have you looked at it yet?
2711602	2712262	Have you looked at it yet?
2713243	2714044	I'm downloading it.
2714144	2718107	It's like at a crawl because it's like, you know, everyone's like, OMG.
2718407	2720048	Yeah, probably everybody's trying to get it right now.
2721792	2728614	All right, well, thank you for the heads up so we can get even more people on there to download it and slow down the network even more.
2729174	2729854	Brilliant idea.
2731634	2732215	I'm just teasing.
2732935	2737336	I'm sorry for ruining Loki's thunder, but I have a drink review for you.
2737576	2737856	Okay.
2739236	2741617	The new Game Fuel, the new Game Fuel thing.
2741697	2743758	I actually got my hands and drank some of it.
2743918	2745818	I have never even heard of Game Fuel.
2745918	2747899	It's that Mountain Dew thing for Halo 3.
2748279	2748799	Oh, God.
2748839	2749519	All right, how is it?
2750995	2752216	Do you like Citrus Cherry?
2753456	2753977	I'm not sure.
2753997	2754937	I like Cherry 7-Up.
2755217	2757358	I like Citrus and I like Cherry, so I don't know why I wouldn't.
2758078	2759399	Then you're probably going to like this.
2759559	2760499	It's like this.
2760599	2763321	It's kind of like, imagine Pepsi.
2763661	2765622	I know that sounds a little wrong because it's Mountain Dew.
2765662	2772545	Imagine Pepsi and Citrus Cherry kind of had sex with each other and you get this kind of bastardation.
2772725	2775106	Well, Mountain Dew is a lovely image to have in my mind.
2776557	2779880	I thought it was like Livewire and Code Red mixed together.
2780000	2780841	Oh no, oh no.
2780921	2783703	I thought it was going to be that way too, but it's not.
2784524	2784824	Oh no.
2785745	2789068	Does it make you any better at Halo?
2791531	2793933	Is there anything else you want to share with the callers tonight, RavensDolphin?
2794938	2796159	One more thing, as usual.
2796599	2798180	Do you think we're going to get tired?
2798200	2803064	It seems like right now we have the kiltrocity of Halo 3 things coming out.
2803104	2803885	We have this drink.
2803945	2807027	We have Burger King getting in the act.
2807427	2808248	What else are we going to see?
2808268	2811230	Are we going to see Halo 3 underwear?
2811250	2812951	Are we going to see Halo 3 clocks?
2813051	2814052	What the hell are we going to see?
2814568	2815589	Halo 3 underwear.
2815649	2816609	I might check that out.
2816649	2817590	That might be kind of fun.
2818431	2818731	You know what?
2818751	2820072	You're probably just going to see everything.
2820752	2823134	I don't know about underwear, but probably everything else.
2823815	2825376	I want Halo 3 underoos.
2825456	2826917	Halloween costumes.
2828178	2829018	I don't know about that.
2829038	2830599	I want Master Chief underoos.
2832721	2833802	She'll wear them around the house.
2834442	2835583	Let me end on one thing and say I hate them.
2835603	2839406	I've seen them in Charlie's Angels where she was dancing in her underoos.
2840982	2844945	No, I don't... Probably some of the other stuff you mentioned, though, is certainly a possibility.
2845326	2853152	Clocks, watches, figurines, books, other collectibles, you name it, it'll be there.
2854013	2855634	Now the chatroom's just going crazy.
2856475	2858476	Son of Dad says Halo 3 condoms.
2859177	2861759	TigerClaw says Halo 3 the cereal box.
2862239	2866142	Oh, Bandit says Halo underwear for those who need extra man cannon support.
2866262	2866723	There you go.
2866743	2869025	Uh...
2870126	2871347	Let me end with this note.
2871507	2872728	I hate the MacBook Pro.
2872768	2873129	Thank you.
2873369	2873589	All right.
2873609	2874089	You're welcome.
2874149	2874850	Have a good one, buddy.
2874870	2875471	Thanks for calling.
2875511	2875751	You too.
2875951	2876111	Bye.
2876271	2876491	Bye.
2877272	2877512	All right.
2877552	2880435	Let's go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2880455	2887581	Again, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
2890783	2894366	And unfortunately, only one call can come through at a time or everything kind of gets screwed up here.
2894486	2896188	So we're going to another call.
2898820	2899761	Man, I can't handle this.
2899821	2901143	This Skype needs to be changed.
2901163	2902224	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2902244	2902605	Who's this?
2904367	2908011	Um... Uh... Hello?
2908111	2908452	Yeah.
2908712	2909513	Hi, hello.
2909573	2910754	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2910794	2911135	Who's this?
2912036	2913217	Nah, it's Legend of Zaku.
2913237	2915660	Just seeing, you know, since I was trying to get through it and everything.
2916001	2916341	That's alright.
2916361	2916902	What's on your mind, buddy?
2918476	2922019	Nothing, just trying to struggle through disappointments over the weekend.
2922460	2926083	In particular, Supernova 2, which has been crapping out in Jersey Gardens.
2926684	2930327	I've heard that there's another location test for DDR Supernova 2.
2930628	2931388	What's the deal?
2931508	2937214	It was the same place where they had the second Supernova location.
2937695	2939877	They had another Supernova location test last year.
2940497	2940878	Anyways...
2941559	2963176	What I've been able to gather from all the folks around my area that actually went to the location test on Thursday Seems that they had, you know, there was brand new paranoias discovered You know, a particular paranoia, Hades Just started to shape up to, you know, become a really good 9-footer Uh-huh Um, trying to dig up the information right now, uh
2963914	2972856	We have crossovers in the form of Bloody Tears, you know, that Castlevania song from Distorted actually now making its appearance in DDR.
2972876	2976176	I'm trying to see what else.
2977016	2983417	Okay, I know it's a whole bunch of videos, but I'll post a clip right now of the track from Ramadi Style.
2983757	2984078	Okay.
2985418	2987138	Wait, so you actually got to play the test?
2987158	2988498	You went out to Jersey to play the test?
2990379	2990639	Hello?
2991019	2991599	Not really.
2991839	2992699	Oh, okay.
2993274	2999276	Because, you know, it was working up until Thursday, and then Friday it was just crapping out ever since.
2999656	3004698	Saturday it managed to get up, but then it started crashing after just scrolling through songs.
3004758	3007499	And then when I showed up today, it was still back to Supernova.
3007939	3008399	Ah, I see.
3009100	3012301	Bandit says if you just type Supernova 2 into YouTube, you can get a bunch of stuff.
3012681	3014221	All right, so you're just mad.
3014241	3015882	Well, I mean, it is a test machine, Zaku.
3015902	3017122	It's not going to work perfectly, right?
3017202	3017363	Right.
3018043	3019703	I assume they had a bad upgrade kit.
3021946	3023688	for all intents and purposes.
3023728	3025670	They're probably going to straighten those issues out.
3026371	3028993	It could be hardware related.
3029294	3030635	Let me try to keep this constructive.
3031055	3034919	Zaku, what would be the one thing you would want to see Konami do with Supernova 2?
3036181	3036381	Well,
3037020	3038601	I know they probably won't be able to do this.
3038641	3041523	Memory card slots, which is damn near impossible at this point.
3042204	3043184	EMUs would be nice.
3043544	3044825	Just follow through on it.
3045586	3059395	Make it offline in addition to online versions just so that you get more arcades to adopt it for those that don't have the money or don't have the means of actually getting an internet connection.
3060516	3062357	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Zaku?
3063391	3082305	um that's pretty much um that's pretty much it hopefully you know if that thing gets back up try to get some more more info but as far as it goes there are you know there are brand new there are brand new 10 footers showing up especially you know from the videos you know the new
3083476	3085898	especially in the only course Boss Rush.
3086258	3089881	So it certainly gives something to keep people busy.
3090701	3092262	So far it's been positive.
3092322	3096906	We're just trying to get through the issues that are holding the test room.
3097686	3098447	I'm happy to go further.
3098767	3099067	All right.
3099487	3101289	Well, Zach, we're going to let you go so we can take more calls.
3101329	3102390	But thank you very much for your call.
3102470	3103050	We appreciate it.
3103430	3103871	Have a good one.
3104311	3109935	Again, if you want to call us, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3109975	3110896	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3110916	3111236	Who's this?
3112560	3113300	GS68.
3113460	3114361	Hi, GS68.
3114381	3115001	What's on your mind, buddy?
3115821	3117602	I finally get to play Maximum Tune 3.
3118322	3119122	Oh, what'd you think?
3120603	3121203	Pretty awesome.
3121503	3129605	Especially like the new ghost battle mode where you basically raise someone's ghost and then after that your ghost gets created.
3129785	3132546	And then after that it creates a ghost of your driving.
3133046	3137928	Now, out of curiosity, did you play this on the PlayStation or did you play this on the arcade?
3138819	3139959	I'm talking about the arcade one.
3140399	3143460	I think the PlayStation 3 one is based off an older game or something.
3143660	3146321	But you played the PlayStation 3 one, would you think?
3147221	3151242	I didn't get it, but again, I can't read Japanese, but I didn't get any sense of what the hell was going on.
3152862	3155303	I mean, obviously there was racing, but I had no idea what the hell was going on.
3155323	3157443	I mean, that's the downside about importing Japanese games.
3157463	3158304	You don't speak the language.
3158764	3160264	I mean, duh, you're not going to understand the game.
3161141	3162122	Maximum Toon 3?
3162162	3163062	That's some pretty good stuff.
3163082	3164483	Yeah, I've already got a few favorites.
3187856	3188236	Oh, cool.
3188457	3189517	Well, then that's a good sign.
3189558	3191339	I don't know what the hell's wrong with the PlayStation 1.
3191739	3195342	Maybe you just haven't played far enough into it, or we're just not understanding what the hell we're doing.
3195402	3195783	I don't know.
3196163	3197504	But it didn't look like that much fun.
3198005	3199466	I'm thinking about reselling on eBay.
3199766	3200227	We'll see.
3201888	3206292	Well, certainly I will check out the arcade one if they get in an arcade near us, and maybe I'll change my mind.
3206592	3208373	Or hopefully the PlayStation 1 will come out here eventually.
3209134	3209554	So we'll see.
3211456	3212417	Is it really popular?
3212437	3213738	Are there long lines to play it?
3213758	3216160	Because the racing games seem to still draw crowds at the arcades.
3217674	3224356	Well, I played it both at San Diego Golf Club and Mojito's Golf Club, and there's about four or five people waiting on each machine.
3224876	3225157	Wow.
3225317	3228318	See, for this day and age, that's still a long wait.
3228378	3229978	That's a popular game, you know?
3231419	3234460	All right, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners, GS68?
3234540	3234740	No.
3235340	3240362	All right, well, I will definitely check out Maximum 2 and 3 when I get a chance and let you know, like the arcade version.
3240382	3242683	I'm not going to base it off a Japanese game I can't understand.
3243523	3243743	All right.
3244163	3244883	All right, take care, buddy.
3245524	3245824	You too.
3245984	3246484	All right, bye-bye.
3247622	3249703	We've got enough time for about one more call here.
3249723	3255505	If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3255545	3256625	But we have another call.
3256665	3257165	Let's go to it.
3257225	3258166	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3258186	3258546	Who's this?
3262067	3263668	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
3263728	3264268	Is somebody there?
3264308	3264728	Can you hear me?
3264768	3265008	Hello?
3265028	3265128	Hello?
3266249	3266930	It's a celebrity.
3266970	3267690	It's Airman.
3267790	3270252	Hello, this is GameStop where you can pre-order Madden 08 and Halo 3.
3270452	3270952	How can I help you?
3271353	3271933	Oh, there you are.
3272894	3274895	Hi, GameStop, where we can pre-order.
3274955	3276516	I want to pre-order Halo 6.
3277657	3278458	Will you take that for me?
3279859	3281320	No, it's actually the Rob D. How's it going, guys?
3281480	3281760	Good.
3281820	3282681	How about you, Rob D.?
3283861	3284462	Not too shabby.
3285663	3286543	I was actually curious.
3286623	3295890	With this Halo Mountain Dew, which I actually did go out and purchase during the break, by the way, because someone described it as a cross between Code Red and regular Mountain Dew, and I love Code Red, but
3296770	3297832	That's a different story altogether.
3298253	3298613	Is it good?
3298714	3299214	I'm curious.
3300316	3301077	I actually like it.
3301117	3308349	It's kind of like a Pepsi or Mountain Dew version of, I guess, Sprite Tropical Remix, if you remember that from a few years ago.
3308449	3310032	Yeah, where the hell are you all getting this at?
3310192	3310532	Like 7-Eleven?
3312230	3312830	DarkSakura.com
3338326	3344554	But I was curious, what licensing agreement between games and some other product would you like to see?
3345094	3348839	I mean, I think that Nintendo's missing a huge thing with, you know...
3349897	3354260	Not doing, say, a Mario Pasta thing, like, Hey, it's a Mario Mastacholi!
3354520	3357502	You know, I thought that they had a Mario Pasta at one time.
3357703	3361325	I swear to God, I know they had... They had the Nintendo Breakfast Entertainment System.
3361345	3362226	Bring back the cereal!
3362246	3363426	They did have Mario Pasta.
3363626	3370311	I remember they had that, because there was like a little Yoshi-shaped... It was like a Nintendo mac and cheese or something.
3370331	3377236	And to tell Dark Tetsuya, Hello Kitty 2DX has the Hello Kitty Dreamcast and the Hello Kitty PlayStation 2.
3378712	3381594	Gosh, what video game tie-ins would you like to see?
3381634	3384096	I want to see BurgerTime 2 with the Foreman Grill.
3385478	3389040	How about like Night Trap 90s?
3389080	3391182	Digital Pictures would still be around if that existed.
3391582	3393204	You could have like PS2 FMV games.
3394225	3395546	Night Trap 90s?
3395886	3396266	What?
3397527	3400290	Yeah, but Dana Plato's not with us anymore to model them.
3400970	3402912	I do like the Halo 3 Underoos.
3402932	3404833	She still can't model them.
3404973	3405834	From the grave.
3406174	3406715	Exactly.
3407856	3408076	That's...
3408661	3409221	All kinds of weird.
3409241	3411542	You've been all about the necrophilia tonight.
3412682	3413382	It's just random.
3415383	3415743	Let's see.
3416123	3418164	I'm opening up to the chat room to see what the chat room thinks.
3418424	3421805	Son of Dad says, Nintendo Wii Sports Bowling Shoes.
3423125	3427847	GS68 says, Halo Racing Game with Warthogs, Ghosts, and Pontiac Grand Ams.
3429667	3431308	We need your mom the game.
3432148	3434729	JVmon says, Mario Spaghetti from Chef Boyardee.
3436449	3437530	How about Chef Mario?
3437910	3438270	Come on.
3442943	3443463	Give me that.
3444984	3445484	I don't know.
3447204	3449025	Yeah, I'm drawing a blank.
3449045	3450006	I'll have to think about that one.
3450026	3451866	Maybe that's a future list list in our future.
3451906	3452247	I don't know.
3453287	3453667	There you go.
3454187	3455548	I do have one more question for you guys.
3455628	3456288	Of course, what's up?
3456408	3456968	One more thing.
3457849	3459169	Nah, not that going there.
3459710	3465592	Have you guys heard the news about how 3D Realms supposedly wants to port Duke Nukem 3D over to Xbox Live Arcade?
3465892	3467873	Stop ruining my last minute stories, dammit!
3469130	3471231	The callers are ruining your last minute stories tonight.
3471571	3471851	All right.
3471891	3472391	No, that's great.
3472831	3476393	Yes, I did read that story, even if Loki was going to read it later.
3476513	3479154	This is totally good radio, but I was going to show you.
3479214	3480875	See, they did have it at one time.
3481135	3484176	Here's a commercial for Super Mario Brothers Kraft and Macaroni Cheese.
3490438	3491099	I want that.
3492539	3494360	How come my mom didn't buy me that when I was a kid?
3495908	3498950	I actually remember that because they had tips for Super Mario Land 2 on the back.
3499210	3500631	That's how I found out about the space world.
3500932	3504454	You know what I fucking hate, though, is the macaroni and cheese that's made out of the powder.
3504514	3505615	That shit is so nasty.
3505775	3506716	The bunny ones are good.
3508277	3514121	If I'm going to make mac and cheese, I have to use that more creamy cheese sauce because the powder is nasty.
3514540	3515820	Anyway, sorry, that was horrible radio.
3517061	3518721	And I even forgot what your second question was.
3519621	3520941	Well, I didn't actually get to it yet.
3520961	3522142	I was wondering if you had read the story.
3522262	3527303	I was wondering what other old PC games would you like to see ported to Xbox Live Arcade?
3527863	3528063	Loom.
3528103	3530604	I've been clamoring for X-Wing for a long time.
3530984	3533684	I would love multiplayer X-Wing on Xbox Live Arcade.
3533984	3535205	But is there anything else?
3536205	3537285	Okay, we've got Loom.
3537465	3538405	Put Loom on the list.
3538465	3538965	We got it.
3539005	3539345	Check.
3539646	3540166	Understood.
3540186	3540726	Yes, ma'am.
3540766	3541666	Loom was great.
3542336	3542677	Really?
3545439	3546320	Loom, Mac and Cheese.
3546821	3553047	I went and bought a copy of Loom like a year ago on eBay just because I wanted it badly and I can't play it.
3553107	3554048	There's your branding.
3554208	3555850	A Loom branded Loom.
3556871	3557772	Wouldn't that be wonderful?
3558273	3559694	What's this made out of, Rob?
3560074	3560415	I don't know.
3560735	3561115	Glass.
3562537	3563037	Let's see.
3563118	3565200	The ferret's in a box where it belongs.
3568024	3572647	What other old... Well, besides Civilization, just because that's my favorite PC game of all time.
3572807	3573668	Completely redone.
3574608	3575409	Descent.
3575889	3576710	That would be kind of cool.
3577030	3579192	I'm trying to think of games that would make good multiplayer games.
3580092	3582034	I remember that from my younger days.
3582354	3583074	Modem Wars.
3583375	3584495	Redneck Rampage.
3584996	3586076	Yeah!
3586237	3587117	Carmageddon.
3587517	3588498	How about J.S.
3588518	3589659	Jackrabbit or Commander Keen?
3590139	3590860	Anyone else play those?
3591600	3591740	What?
3591780	3592321	Commander Keen?
3592361	3593081	Commander Keen, yeah.
3593101	3593422	Or J.S.
3593462	3593882	Jackrabbit?
3594438	3595739	I think that's Jackrabbit.
3595759	3596739	Was Jill of the Jungle?
3596799	3597199	Hell yeah.
3598179	3601081	Oh, ZZT while we're at it, although I don't think that would really work.
3601361	3603021	That wouldn't work on Xbox 360, I don't think.
3603041	3604282	We need Gemstone!
3604502	3605462	Z-Rabbits for the win.
3606082	3607483	How's that for your MMO?
3607563	3609244	It's been years since I've played that game.
3609524	3613025	We need, like, the old text-based MMOs.
3613505	3615466	Yes, I want Zork on Xbox Live Arcade.
3617524	3618585	Multiplayer Zork.
3618825	3621647	You saw the page that's a 404 error that's Zork.
3622047	3622688	Yeah, I've seen that.
3623048	3623548	It's great.
3623808	3624389	Enter room.
3624729	3625570	You can't enter room.
3627211	3629632	Did you ever play the Crimson Room game?
3631093	3632534	It's a Flash game.
3633535	3635596	They need those type of games on Xbox Live Arcade.
3635636	3637738	How about Oregon Trail on Xbox Live Arcade?
3638418	3639639	There's number munchers.
3639679	3640860	That'd be pretty rad.
3641020	3643842	We were talking about Oregon Trail, Rob.
3645393	3649156	at, um, at Pentagogo, not Pentagogo, that's the old one, um, at California Extreme.
3649176	3649496	Yeah.
3649817	3660285	It was me and Julie and Dan and Mel and Melody at the Ben and Jerry's talking about Oregon Trail and all those, and, um, and we were talking about, uh, our favorite old games.
3660305	3662666	Reliving Diphtheria over and over again.
3662786	3665248	I was like, dude, where in time is Carmen Sandiego?
3665569	3668611	There you go, there's another great Xbox Live potential, I don't know.
3668671	3670953	Where in, no, where in time, specifically.
3670993	3672314	Now we're just naming random shit.
3672494	3673995	No, I'm not, I'm serious.
3674175	3675036	I want that game again.
3675632	3676693	I was good at it, too.
3677033	3678434	Well, Rob D., let me ask you.
3678494	3679014	Oh, thank you.
3679074	3680615	ShadowCharlie in chat says Heretic.
3680655	3681576	Yes, we need that game.
3681596	3683177	No, we just need Hexen.
3683577	3684738	Rob D., what would you want?
3686339	3688260	X-Wing and X-Wing Commander Keen.
3688601	3689942	Well, actually, just X-Wing and JSJ.
3689982	3691182	That would be the two that I could think of.
3691583	3696506	Just because those had multiplayer in there already, that would translate perfectly to Xbox Live Arcade.
3696766	3697867	How about One Must Fall?
3698207	3699188	Phantasmagoria.
3700108	3700449	Can you do?
3700889	3702150	No, seriously, Phantasmagoria.
3702310	3703130	I'll be pretty right.
3703170	3704251	Phantasmagoria was huge.
3704271	3705492	It was like seven CDs, wasn't it?
3706289	3706889	It gets it.
3708150	3708751	It's old now.
3709131	3715595	Well, Rob D., thank you for the conversation about good PC gaming retro goodness, but we've got to let you go and wrap up the show.
3716455	3716775	No problem.
3716795	3717276	See you guys later.
3717336	3717536	All right.
3717556	3717996	Take care, buddy.
3718736	3719037	Bye-bye.
3719837	3720097	All right.
3720117	3721778	Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.
3721798	3728642	Thanks so much to those that called in, and sorry to those that didn't get through, but if we took any more calls, then Loki's last-minute stories might get spoiled.
3728982	3731624	So, Loki, if you have any last-minute stories, please, now's the time.
3732407	3733768	Anyways, let's see.
3733888	3740991	Duke Nukem 3D is waiting for the Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade Go Ahead, so I'm going to remove that.
3742211	3744392	Okay, and Bioshock on the marketplace.
3744593	3745273	Bye-bye.
3747774	3748194	Let's see here.
3748334	3749215	Oh, yeah.
3749735	3756218	There is apparently a TIFF exploit now in the PlayStation 3 firmware, 1.81, and they've gotten...
3759719	3763641	and apparently a backup of a PlayStation 1 game to run on it.
3764862	3765142	Yay.
3765382	3765883	What game?
3766223	3766563	I don't know.
3767564	3770865	And then also a Hello World little demo thing.
3771006	3773247	Sorry, it was Crash Bandicoot Crash Party.
3773307	3779450	Therefore, this thing has no usefulness whatsoever because nobody wants to play that fucking game.
3780451	3781171	Pandemonium.
3781572	3782312	It was Devil Dice.
3782432	3782912	Enjoy.
3783133	3785394	And then I'm going to say this.
3786560	3787462	XBOX 360 ULTIMATE
3797148	3799849	with an HDMI port and HD DVD drive.
3799989	3802370	Because if he's seeing it, oh, it's got to be true.
3802550	3803410	It must be true.
3803450	3805811	Why is that even being reported on the site anywhere?
3806611	3810512	Because this one website likes to report complete rumor stories like that.
3810632	3813893	Then again, we ran the Sega list, but only because somebody submitted it.
3814314	3815794	And because I wanted it to be true.
3815814	3817214	Yeah, we just wanted it to be true.
3820556	3821276	All right, anyhow...
3822802	3826404	I have one other last minute story here coming out of Anderson, South Carolina.
3826444	3829405	Thanks, Tiger Claw, for sending me the link because I think this is all kinds of funny.
3829905	3831426	This actually happened at a Toys R Us.
3831446	3834207	There was a 13-year-old PlayStation hater at the store.
3834528	3837029	Unfortunately, we don't know his name because of those laws that protect children.
3837389	3847854	But what he did, he used a permanent black marker to write PS3 sucks on 23 plastic security cases used to protect Sony PlayStation games from being stolen.
3848654	3850255	Of course, the Toys R Us employees caught him.
3850315	3851856	He was held until police arrived.
3852577	3856719	His parents were not able to be reached, so he was taken to child services.
3857700	3863723	When he was asked why he did it by the police, he said, quote, I have an Xbox and I hate PlayStation.
3864084	3866905	I found the marker lying on the shelf and I guess I was bored.
3867165	3867566	Sorry.
3869687	3870828	That's fantastic.
3871348	3872088	I guess I was bored.
3872108	3874490	I find it even better they couldn't find the stupid parents.
3875051	3877173	It was completely unsupervised and poorly raised.
3877193	3879634	Well, they were off doing crack, of course.
3880455	3882637	They were off, you know, doing crack.
3882737	3885459	They should be spayed and neutered.
3886840	3888621	Remember, spay and neuter your humans.
3888761	3890042	Did you check the Olive Garden?
3892884	3894705	Alright, that's it.
3894786	3895766	Do you have anything, Loki?
3899209	3903012	No, but I wanted to see some of the stuff for Supernova 2.
3904481	3906842	I guess I'll have to get the PlayStation 2 game.
3909284	3910164	Key word is get.
3910825	3915007	DJ Kipples and Bits says, I guess he didn't have enough games to play on his 360.
3915447	3916708	Damn the summer game drought.
3916908	3920470	No, no, you have it mistaken with the PlayStation 3.
3921250	3921891	Or the Wii.
3922291	3922771	Christ.
3923151	3924352	Well, he's playing games on the Wii.
3924412	3925533	It's just none of them are any good.
3926153	3931496	By the way, and I don't know how this story did not make tonight's show roll, but I swear to God I saw a story on it somewhere where...
3932003	3934625	DarkSakura, they have officially announced they're making a Cooking Mama 2.
3936006	3936546	Squee!
3936786	3937947	Oh, that's right, because I didn't care.
3938007	3942870	That's why I wasn't on the show roll, because I was like, oh, Cooking Mama 2, don't care.
3943090	3944711	I still need to borrow yours, Rob, on the Wii.
3946052	3946692	I ain't playing it.
3947192	3949574	Yeah, Cooking Mama 2 in early 2008.
3950794	3953216	505 Games has entered into agreement with Cooking Mama Limited.
3953945	3958287	to deliver Cookie Mama 2 for the DS and the Wii across Europe in early 2008.
3958547	3960828	So I imagine it's just a matter of time.
3960868	3972793	I want it to be like a story-based game where Cookie Mama's relative accidentally murders somebody and they have to dispose of the body in creative culinary ways.
3973313	3974693	I think that would be pretty cool.
3975293	3976434	Mama will fix it.
3978315	3979195	Cookie Mama.
3981236	3981536	I don't know.
3982660	3983700	Cooking Mama Massacre.
3983740	3984441	Mafia.
3984501	3985601	Cooking Mama Vice City.
3986241	3988062	Cooking Mama Mafia Story.
3988142	3989222	It's Murdering Mama.
3992103	3993363	Mama Fix Everything.
3993443	3994783	Cooking Mama Soylent Green.
3995784	3997384	It's people!
3997864	3998404	No!
3998804	3999104	All right.
4000025	4003866	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought because we're about to wrap up the show.
4003946	4004846	So final thoughts.
4004906	4005726	Loki, your final thought.
4006787	4012068	My final thought is game publishers are coming out in a few weeks and that makes me happy.
4013519	4018406	and my final thought is I still hate macaroni and cheese with the powdered cheese.
4018546	4019587	I love the powdered cheese!
4019607	4021189	Cheese should not be in powder form.
4021249	4021950	That's disgusting.
4023132	4024153	DarkSakura, your final thought.
4028459	4028960	That was it?
4029821	4030602	Freaking cookies.
4031334	4032134	Cookies are great.
4032174	4033235	You know, I have more cookie dough.
4033395	4034015	I should make more cookies.
4034035	4035115	Let's just eat the cookie dough, Rob.
4035375	4036436	No, that's disgusting.
4036496	4036936	No, it's not.
4036996	4037416	It's great.
4037436	4039137	You can get sick because of the raw eggs.
4039537	4040157	You know what?
4040317	4040757	What?
4040817	4042258	That's really an old wives' tale.
4042718	4047420	Because I used to work at a cookie place, and I used to take home the cookie dough.
4049280	4053782	Just because you didn't get sick does not mean you can't get sick.
4054625	4057108	I have special not getting sick from cookie dough power.
4057188	4061273	It's that special butter and sugar mix that protects you from the salmonella.
4061453	4062735	It lines your stomach.
4062875	4065718	Leave it to me to be the first person to die from eating cookie dough.
4066620	4066860	All right.
4067943	4070445	We're going to wrap it up, you guys, and call it a week.
