00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:19,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:29,264
[SPEAKER_11]: And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August 19th, 2007, for part B of episode number 243 of our podcast.

4
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:30,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we've been doing this a little while.

5
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:36,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, on our show, if you're brand new to our program, we like to discuss the latest in video games and gaming culture.

6
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:40,011
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, we're three gamers that all met playing DDR at an arcade and

7
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:44,828
[SPEAKER_11]: We've known each other for about five years doing this program and just kind of like to give our share.

8
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:46,629
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, it's all about what you guys have to say as well.

9
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,131
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can always interact with our program through the chat room or through our Skype line or our voicemail or mailbag.

10
00:00:53,171 --> 00:01:00,914
[SPEAKER_11]: You can always send us emails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com because if we can do a show, if any old idiots like us can do a show, then you guys should be able to be a part of it as well.

11
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:03,015
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyhow, let's get back into the gaming news.

12
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:06,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Started off with some talk about Mario Kart coming out on the Wii.

13
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:09,337
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some brand new details about Mario Kart on the Wii.

14
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:31,007
[SPEAKER_11]: apparently a couple of screenshots, new screenshots actually hit the internet this week and so it gives some more details about what's going on of course the tracks appear to be bigger and better as you would expect on a new console you can do jumps, little jumps again, the jump button is back 12 player racing online, shortcuts within the tracks as well mid-air stunts apparently can be done in the game as well

15
00:01:31,445 --> 00:01:38,994
[SPEAKER_11]: and tracks being carried over from Mario Kart Double Dash, which is cool because some of the classic tracks, of course, have awesome design in them.

16
00:01:39,394 --> 00:01:46,443
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to see the old school Rainbow Road come back one more time because I wasn't as big of a fan of the new school Rainbow Roads as the old one.

17
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:49,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Mario Kart 64, I think, was probably one of the best.

18
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:51,622
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Mario Kart 64.

19
00:01:51,783 --> 00:01:55,064
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of the few Nintendo 64 games I really, really adore.

20
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:58,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, by the way, I forgot to say in Part A during my gaming week, I played F-Zero 64.

21
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:00,806
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't care for it.

22
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, Jamie, you said you loved that one.

23
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:03,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't really care for it.

24
00:02:03,827 --> 00:02:12,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I do see, though, now where a lot of GX, the GameCube one, came from, because it totally feels like an earlier version of F-Zero GX.

25
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:20,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought Mario Kart 64 was a way better racer on the Nintendo 64 than F-Zero, sadly.

26
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:22,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Which makes me sad, because I love my F-Zero.

27
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:24,106
[SPEAKER_11]: But, oh well.

28
00:02:24,488 --> 00:02:24,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

29
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:30,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, some interesting news in the homebrew scene on the Wii.

30
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:38,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, if you have a mod-chipped Wii, they have just enabled it to be able to play DVDs, as if you really need to do that.

31
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:49,537
[SPEAKER_09]: But, in case you're interested, what you can do is actually using a, I guess, clone CD, like some special boot CD that you create.

32
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:52,699
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll boot it with your Wii that's got...

33
00:02:53,719 --> 00:03:01,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's a mod that's programmed in Wyo Assembly 1.8, and I guess they use this program called Wii Boss.

34
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:06,643
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what you do is you just mount the disc and pop in the DVD.

35
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:13,145
[SPEAKER_09]: So you get to play it using the Wii Remote, of course, as the remote for it.

36
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:15,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it's kind of gimmicky, kind of cool.

37
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:21,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully something that they can implement later on, since it looks like the Wii is fully capable, of course, playing DVD movies.

38
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:27,858
[SPEAKER_05]: There has to be some sort of functionality already built in that they're going to release something for later.

39
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Seems so weird how Nintendo does that.

40
00:03:30,899 --> 00:03:33,419
[SPEAKER_11]: They love to do these time release things on their consoles.

41
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:35,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, DS, surprise, it goes online.

42
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Surprise, it has voice chat.

43
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Surprise.

44
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,541
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just interesting.

45
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:40,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo has some very interesting strategies sometimes.

46
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:46,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think that as a company, they're very far-seeing.

47
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:46,823
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

48
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:48,583
[SPEAKER_05]: They look at the big picture, the...

49
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:52,996
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a vision and stick to it.

50
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:57,118
[SPEAKER_09]: There was speculation on this article by Gizmodo.

51
00:03:57,638 --> 00:03:58,539
[SPEAKER_09]: They were saying that

52
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:22,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly later on, since the whole issue was DVD licensing fees, I guess the license, the technology to play back DVD video, obviously they didn't want to increase the cost of the Wii, so what you could possibly do later on is get a DVD channel for your Wii downloaded off of WiiWare, and then you pay the money for the licensing fee up front, there you go, pop that in and you can play DVDs.

53
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:26,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, AZHP brings up an interesting point in our chat room.

54
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:31,835
[SPEAKER_11]: There can't be anything already in the Wii that can play DVDs because they need to buy the licensing to include that software.

55
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:35,817
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not legal for them to add in DVD compatibility and time release it.

56
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:37,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

57
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:43,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Son of Dad said the Dreamcast was going to have DVD playback, but it never happened.

58
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:49,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I still don't think that there's any problem because really the DVD, the audio and video...

59
00:04:50,837 --> 00:05:02,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, that's just a particular file, and if the Wii is already set up to read those types of files, then having specific DVD playability in the Wii is not the issue.

60
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,928
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not made with that intent.

61
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:06,590
[SPEAKER_05]: It would just be able to read those files already.

62
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:10,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs the software, I think.

63
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:16,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Ross Deal UT says, what a thinly veiled attempt to justify pirate mod chips, since, hey, it plays DVDs.

64
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:18,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and by the way, you can play copied games.

65
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting thought.

66
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:37,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo's always, well, this whole thing that surprised me about modding the Wii and about their import policy with it is that they never, I guess, really cared that much in the past, given that in every other system except the GameCube, it was all physical lockout.

67
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:42,933
[SPEAKER_05]: At least with the TurboGrafx, it was a difference in the pin sets on the HuCards.

68
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:46,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was no real good converter.

69
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the one that was supposed to be the best.

70
00:05:48,937 --> 00:05:49,437
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't work.

71
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:54,701
[SPEAKER_05]: So, except for the CD games, there was no country coding, but there were still new CD games.

72
00:05:55,261 --> 00:06:03,525
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I don't see exactly why they're as all up in arms on this when, you know, Sony's like, hey, you can play them, here.

73
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:06,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know.

74
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:14,419
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of an old debate at this point for me, but, you know, I think everything should be region-free.

75
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:23,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand the intent to region-lock things, especially, I mean, I can understand because of the DVD licensing, you have to region-lock things, but with the Wii, if you don't have DVD playback, you don't need to region-lock things.

76
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,645
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think you have to region-lock everything with DVDs and stuff.

77
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:28,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, look at the... Unless it's porn.

78
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:33,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the PlayStation 3, granted, it's Blu-ray, but, you know, that's region-free.

79
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,229
[SPEAKER_09]: The PSP's region-free.

80
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,410
[SPEAKER_09]: DS is region-free.

81
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:38,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Game Boy Advance region free.

82
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:41,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't see what the point is.

83
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:48,634
[SPEAKER_09]: If anything, you're going to be selling more copies of games because people are going to buy, like, say, Owen Dunn and then buy Elite Beat Agents.

84
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:50,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you sold an extra copy in Japan.

85
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares if they paid money to have it shipped over here?

86
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:54,137
[SPEAKER_09]: That's their money.

87
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:56,999
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, but you sold an extra copy because of that.

88
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that really a bad thing?

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to get a Ninja Pass, but that's another story.

90
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Jaded says, Nintendo is a toy company.

91
00:07:04,463 --> 00:07:06,284
[SPEAKER_11]: They produce toys, not DVD players.

92
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:36,742
[SPEAKER_11]: GS68 says because if you buy the Japanese version of a game that has a North American version it could cause problems with your region's market interesting alright well if you want to chat with us join our chatroom chat.orangeloungeradio.com and give us your two cents well for anybody who is still keeping up with anything about the virtual console in the way I do have the update for the UK

93
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:43,048
[SPEAKER_05]: As you were saying previously, Wave Race 64 is out for 1,000 points.

94
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:47,070
[SPEAKER_05]: It translated to 7 pounds, 10 euro.

95
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:50,692
[SPEAKER_05]: And, well, it's Wave Race, which I didn't really care for.

96
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,674
[SPEAKER_05]: You also have Crater Maze from the TurboGrafx-16.

97
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:56,495
[SPEAKER_05]: 600 Wii points, 420 pounds, 6 euro.

98
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:57,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's it.

99
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:04,642
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

100
00:08:21,144 --> 00:08:24,485
[SPEAKER_11]: and some weird games coming out for the PlayStation 2 very soon.

101
00:08:25,265 --> 00:08:31,567
[SPEAKER_11]: A brand new accessory is coming out for the PlayStation 2 and Into Games is supposed to be revealing this at the Games Convention in Leipzig.

102
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:34,927
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a Wiimote, basically, for the PlayStation 2.

103
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:35,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I probably shouldn't call it that.

104
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:38,768
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a motion-sensing pad for the PlayStation 2.

105
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:45,130
[SPEAKER_11]: The games that are going to be coming out for it, Real Play Tennis, Real Play Pool, Real Play Golf...

106
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,211
[SPEAKER_11]: RealPlay Racing, RealPlay Bowling, and RealPlay Puzzle Spear.

107
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:50,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm, I've heard of some of these games before.

108
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:58,713
[SPEAKER_11]: The little sensing pad is supposed to emulate tennis rackets, pool cues, golf clubs, and steering wheels, amongst others.

109
00:08:59,353 --> 00:08:59,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

110
00:09:01,193 --> 00:09:03,254
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard a voice of disagreement over there, Loki.

111
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:03,794
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think?

112
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:05,334
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gimmicky shit.

113
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:05,934
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it is.

114
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:10,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen the pictures of them, and it's not what you think.

115
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:13,456
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a game pad, per se.

116
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:14,556
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like the Wii Remote.

117
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,590
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

118
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:48,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, on the other hand, I can't help but feel like I've played these games before, and when games start feeling unoriginal, I don't know about you guys, but I get a little bit angsty.

119
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:49,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys get a little bit angsty?

120
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:50,523
[SPEAKER_00]: All the time.

121
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:53,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that means it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

122
00:09:55,747 --> 00:10:05,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, why don't you start us off?

123
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:06,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

124
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:12,661
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to headaches that develop into nosebleeds.

125
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:16,466
[SPEAKER_11]: That's no fun.

126
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:17,367
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.

127
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:18,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?

128
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And also an F you to nosebleeds while I'm busy drinking.

129
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:24,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

130
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:24,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

131
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:31,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, F you to pompous little jerks that think they can drive their truck around like it's a fucking race car.

132
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:36,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, actually this was funny, we saw this last night while we were at the movie theater.

133
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:41,412
[SPEAKER_09]: This dumbass blowing through tons of stop signs in the parking lot, driving like 50 miles an hour.

134
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:46,414
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, usually it's like, where the fuck are the cops when you need them?

135
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,215
[SPEAKER_09]: There just happened to be a cop right when you needed him.

136
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Pulled the bastard over, it was awesome.

137
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,156
[SPEAKER_09]: I laughed my ass off.

138
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:54,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

139
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:55,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Justice is served.

140
00:10:57,605 --> 00:11:02,267
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU goes to this weird cavity thing I have in my mouth.

141
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:11,472
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like a tooth cavity, but I think like one of my crowns is coming off or something, and now there's like a cavity, and it sucks because it hurts, and now I have to go to the dentist, and I hate going to the dentist.

142
00:11:11,892 --> 00:11:14,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I... Oh, God, the dentist makes you feel so stupid.

143
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:16,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know about you guys, but I hate my dentist.

144
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:18,315
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've hated every single one.

145
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:20,677
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's only been like one dentist I've ever gone to I ever liked.

146
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:21,477
[SPEAKER_05]: You should go to my dentist.

147
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:22,177
[SPEAKER_05]: He's very great.

148
00:11:22,337 --> 00:11:23,438
[SPEAKER_11]: He probably doesn't take my insurance.

149
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:26,907
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to my dentist insurance, not letting me go to very many dentists.

150
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:27,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I always fall asleep.

151
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:29,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

152
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Just F you to the dentist in general.

153
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:32,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Not my favorite thing to do.

154
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:34,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Wah.

155
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, just kind of following up with the story here.

156
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:39,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is really bad radio, but this is what they are.

157
00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:44,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the controllers for the real thing.

158
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:47,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God, those look like those crappy attachments that they came out with for the Wii.

159
00:11:47,738 --> 00:11:49,539
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

160
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Except they're not.

161
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:53,381
[SPEAKER_09]: They just have little sensors and shit on them, so...

162
00:11:54,622 --> 00:12:05,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's not a whole lot to get excited about, but hey, I mean, if you're into that kind of stuff and you don't want to go out and buy an actual Wii system and you want to be able to bowl at home and stuff, great, buy the game.

163
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:06,932
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only like 30 bucks anyway, so.

164
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:14,999
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not really a Wiimote coming to the PlayStation 2, but it's these, you know, Wii-like technologies coming to the PlayStation 2.

165
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Something like that, yeah.

166
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:16,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

167
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

168
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:36,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what's also interesting, this kind of leaked out during an online demo for, I believe it was for another game, during Unreal Tournament 3, they had accidentally paused the game or something, and a gamer card screen popped up that's going to be tied in with home.

169
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:45,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently, you know, the PlayStation Network will be getting a similar type of thing with their home service, and...

170
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:52,930
[SPEAKER_09]: My guess is going to be very similar to what Xbox has right now with their live service.

171
00:12:52,950 --> 00:13:04,952
[SPEAKER_09]: What's interesting, though, is Gamer Card might sound familiar, seeing as there's that whole My Gamer Card thing as part of Xbox.

172
00:13:05,212 --> 00:13:07,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

173
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:08,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

174
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:13,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, if it's not broken, why fix it?

175
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:15,594
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the most original idea, but...

176
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:18,229
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good that they're getting something else, I guess.

177
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:21,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Joshi16 says, Sony innovating again.

178
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Brilliant.

179
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:23,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Innovation.

180
00:13:24,132 --> 00:13:25,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's the key word.

181
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:25,573
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

182
00:13:25,593 --> 00:13:28,975
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you guys want to comment on this, we're actually going to open our Skype line a little bit early tonight.

183
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:32,897
[SPEAKER_11]: If you weren't listening to Part A, unfortunately, the live stream is getting shut off at 8 p.m.

184
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:34,498
[SPEAKER_11]: or so we're being told for some maintenance.

185
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:43,703
[SPEAKER_11]: So to make sure that our live listeners get a chance to interact with us tonight before the plug is pulled on the live stream and we have to finish the show with no live interaction, we want to open up our Skype line.

186
00:13:43,743 --> 00:13:44,203
[SPEAKER_11]: So please...

187
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Head on over and give us a call.

188
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:49,066
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-866-GAME-OLR.

189
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:51,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, is it 1-866 or 1-877?

190
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:51,907
877.

191
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,189
[SPEAKER_11]: God damn it.

192
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,149
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

193
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:57,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it right, Rob.

194
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:00,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I know it after this amount of time.

195
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,371
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

196
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:07,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

197
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:08,173
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

198
00:14:08,293 --> 00:14:11,774
[SPEAKER_11]: So just waiting for a call to come in and we'll take it.

199
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:13,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Bioshock Bioshock

200
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:44,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I want to ask you that the minigame, the hacking minigame, are you good at that game?

201
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:48,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, you said you didn't do it, didn't you?

202
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:51,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't able to complete it, but I only tried it one time.

203
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:51,940
[SPEAKER_11]: It reminded me.

204
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,461
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Pipe Dream.

205
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,622
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it was, Pipe Dream.

206
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:58,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Or that game on PopCap Games with the little Chinese fireworks.

207
00:14:58,404 --> 00:15:00,485
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember the name of that game, but it reminded me of both those games.

208
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:01,526
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, it's real easy.

209
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:03,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's my trick in the whole thing.

210
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:05,969
[SPEAKER_09]: You just flip over all the tiles if you can.

211
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:07,290
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my trick.

212
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:07,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

213
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:08,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Connect them.

214
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there, like, why wouldn't you want to flip over all the tiles?

215
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:13,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there, like, a downside to flipping them over?

216
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:14,103
[SPEAKER_02]: You pay money.

217
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:14,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that I found out.

218
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:15,304
[SPEAKER_11]: You pay money?

219
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, it's either hack it or pay money.

220
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:19,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

221
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:20,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, no.

222
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:22,591
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're flipping over the tiles, you don't pay money.

223
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:23,532
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just... No, no, no.

224
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:26,394
[SPEAKER_02]: If you lose, then your health goes bad.

225
00:15:27,015 --> 00:15:31,138
[SPEAKER_09]: You can pay money to just have it automatically hack, or you can do the tile thing.

226
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:33,440
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, I don't understand why you wouldn't flip over all the tiles.

227
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:35,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just some...

228
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:38,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people I talk to go like, the game's hard.

229
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,039
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really hard.

230
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,100
[SPEAKER_02]: You're supposed to flip over every tile and try to figure out shit.

231
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:46,862
[SPEAKER_11]: That seems to kind of defeat the purpose if you just go in there and flip over every tile.

232
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:50,604
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some other tiles that are in the actual game.

233
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:53,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if there's a downside to flipping over tiles.

234
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:58,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that's one of the differences where the demo and the real game are a little different.

235
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:00,367
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll have to ask someone I know that already owns the game.

236
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,468
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you want to say about the hacking, RavensDolphin?

237
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:08,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, yesterday I showed how I can be very good at the hacking.

238
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:10,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed everyone that I can get it done quite quickly.

239
00:16:11,185 --> 00:16:12,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And they went like, oh, it's very hard.

240
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:13,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I went like, it's not hard.

241
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:15,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And I showed them that it's not hard.

242
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And what did they do?

243
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:19,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Were they calling you names because you just flipped over every tile?

244
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:20,647
[SPEAKER_11]: That was your trick, or what?

245
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,767
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they just went like, I can never get through the hacking.

246
00:16:24,407 --> 00:16:26,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the little mini-game, I'm like, I'm going to show you how to get through it.

247
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:30,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I believe in the full version of the game you're supposed to be able to hack the vending machines.

248
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:31,969
[SPEAKER_11]: There's other stuff you can hack, too.

249
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:34,505
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other things that hack in the game.

250
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:35,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait for it though.

251
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, are you excited about Bioshock?

252
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:41,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the thing about, there's an interesting story about this game for me.

253
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:44,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember pre-ordering it at all.

254
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:48,356
[SPEAKER_02]: EB says I have a pre-order for it, so someone must like me.

255
00:16:49,056 --> 00:16:51,178
[SPEAKER_02]: You think somebody went in there and put a pre-order down for you?

256
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:52,819
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

257
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,722
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't remember for the life of me why I have a pre-order for it.

258
00:16:57,703 --> 00:16:59,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well one more thing Raven's Dolphin.

259
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:01,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was one more thing.

260
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:04,120
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about Bioshock.

261
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:09,084
[SPEAKER_02]: When you first saw Rapture, was your jaw on the floor like, that can't be right?

262
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:13,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Like when you first go down into the city?

263
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:13,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

264
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:17,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.

265
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:55,507
[SPEAKER_11]: and 2K to some extent did this with their last game, Prey, which I actually talked about on this program a lot and it was actually a first person shooter I really liked was Prey because it was set up for dummies like me who could never die in Prey.

266
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:56,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I loved it.

267
00:17:57,228 --> 00:18:01,291
[SPEAKER_11]: For the hardcore FPS fan, they hated it, but it was also set up very much like a movie.

268
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:05,793
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know, Bioshock pulls it off in a different way that's much more engrossing than even Prey.

269
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:07,394
[SPEAKER_02]: One last thing.

270
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:08,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

271
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:08,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Next gen flushing.

272
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed flushing the toilet and see it actually going down.

273
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:13,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Which way did it spin?

274
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:15,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Which way did it flash?

275
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:20,913
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good question, because it is the bottom of the ocean.

276
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:23,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Because this city is supposed to exist at the bottom of the ocean.

277
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:25,434
[SPEAKER_11]: So the question is, does it spin a different way?

278
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:26,834
[SPEAKER_05]: What part of the world was it in?

279
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:27,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

280
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:32,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that now we have next-gen flushing, and this is next generation.

281
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Flushing and water.

282
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:36,076
[SPEAKER_11]: You could flush the toilet in Duke Nukem 3D.

283
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:38,577
[SPEAKER_05]: You could flush the toilets in Final Fantasy VI.

284
00:18:38,957 --> 00:18:40,117
[SPEAKER_02]: But not like this.

285
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:42,157
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just go up to it and just flush it.

286
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:45,138
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go in the bathroom in the palace...

287
00:18:45,845 --> 00:18:47,946
[SPEAKER_05]: You can kneel on the toilet.

288
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:49,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's the problem.

289
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:51,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And you move off of it and it flushes.

290
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:52,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

291
00:18:52,528 --> 00:18:54,009
[SPEAKER_11]: So do all the boys sit when they pee?

292
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,630
[SPEAKER_05]: It's everybody kneels on the toilet.

293
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,492
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can also flush them in Animal Crossing, too, if you sit on them like a chair.

294
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:01,472
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are very bored.

295
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:11,737
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to say, that certainly lets you know that the creators of the game have gotten it down to every last freaking detail when the toilet flushes and everything.

296
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:17,630
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that you can run around and eat all the food and smoke all the cigarettes, and apparently you can also play the guitars in the game.

297
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy Shonen in chat says, LOL, the ideal of next gen, flushing toilets.

298
00:19:22,614 --> 00:19:25,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Gold Banjo says, OMG, how far technology has taken us.

299
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:26,637
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exciting.

300
00:19:26,937 --> 00:19:27,217
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

301
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:28,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm feeling very confident about people's gaming.

302
00:19:28,859 --> 00:19:30,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad DarkSakura is feeling my thing.

303
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just shocked as well, just flushing that toilet.

304
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:33,943
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, this is it.

305
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:34,944
[SPEAKER_02]: This is next gen.

306
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:35,264
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

307
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to let you go.

308
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:37,126
[SPEAKER_05]: This gives me hope for the future.

309
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:40,108
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can go get your copy of Bioshock and flush all the toilets, okay?

310
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,020
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, bye.

311
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:20,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they... Actually, they've been doing a lot of restructuring because they have really bad money management because of the whole hot coffee incident.

312
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:21,983
[SPEAKER_08]: They poured millions of dollars down that.

313
00:20:22,323 --> 00:20:23,683
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually way down.

314
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:30,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and especially the fact that they don't really have anything new coming out this year now also kind of has to hurt them a little bit.

315
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:31,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, definitely.

316
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:33,327
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

317
00:20:34,808 --> 00:20:36,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that all you wanted to comment on, or is there other stuff tonight?

318
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:38,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, um...

319
00:20:39,693 --> 00:20:44,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I didn't really get into the feed until after Part B, and Part B wasn't that long.

320
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:51,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I know, because we have to make sure we get the Skype in before 8 o'clock tonight, but our podcast will still have everything in it, all the stories and everything.

321
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what games have you been playing this week?

322
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:56,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing a lot of Half-Life 2, actually.

323
00:20:57,163 --> 00:20:57,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah?

324
00:20:58,784 --> 00:21:02,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I just got a new computer, and I got this headset just so I could Skype in and call you guys.

325
00:21:02,707 --> 00:21:03,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome!

326
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:04,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool, thank you.

327
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,474
[SPEAKER_11]: So wait, you brought a brand new computer?

328
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:10,118
[SPEAKER_11]: So is it like a top of the line, or is it like a Costco computer, or what?

329
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:12,419
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of a budget computer.

330
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,160
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a Dell, $600.

331
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:19,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, eh, I want something that plays games, but I don't want something that will kill my wallet.

332
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,187
[SPEAKER_11]: So you probably won't be playing Bioshock on it.

333
00:21:22,568 --> 00:21:23,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, man, I wish I could.

334
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:24,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have a 360?

335
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:29,414
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just have a Wii for now.

336
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:31,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not getting into the next gen until...

337
00:21:32,345 --> 00:21:35,207
[SPEAKER_08]: They fixed the stability issues on the Xbox 360.

338
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:40,011
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, actually, Ross Steele kind of brings up a follow-up point in the chatroom.

339
00:21:40,051 --> 00:21:46,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Ross Steele, UT, says as far as Take-Two, because 2K is a part of that, and says they almost have nothing other than GTA.

340
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Bioshock might be their first post-GTA hit.

341
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:51,860
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe they do have a game this year that's going to bring in the money.

342
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,300
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was 2K that was doing Bioshock.

343
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,621
[SPEAKER_11]: It is 2K that's doing Bioshock, but don't they all roll up in Take-Two?

344
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:01,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Take-Two owns 2K and they also own Rockstar.

345
00:22:01,762 --> 00:22:03,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so it's just different subsidiaries of Take-Two.

346
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I see.

347
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:06,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

348
00:22:08,064 --> 00:22:14,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to, like, every time a great game comes out for the Xbox 360, I'm like, man, I wish I had an Xbox 360.

349
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:20,469
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I hear stories of like, oh man, my Xbox 360 broke just before this game came out.

350
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:21,349
[SPEAKER_08]: What am I going to do?

351
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:21,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like,

352
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:24,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to get that anymore.

353
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, at least they have the warranty thing, so it's a little better now.

354
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:29,104
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

355
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:30,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

356
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:32,646
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's about it.

357
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:33,187
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

358
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:35,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you so much for calling, and have a good week, okay?

359
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:36,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you too.

360
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,190
[SPEAKER_11]: Have fun with the new computer.

361
00:22:38,011 --> 00:22:38,431
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

362
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:38,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

363
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:39,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye-bye.

364
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if he'll be playing World of Warcraft on that computer because there's a lot of people who go out and get those budget computers to play World of Warcraft.

365
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:45,422
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

366
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:47,102
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take a couple more calls.

367
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:50,984
[SPEAKER_11]: If you'd like to give us a call, again, the number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

368
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:53,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

369
00:22:53,845 --> 00:22:55,845
[SPEAKER_11]: But don't call now because we have another call on the line right now.

370
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:56,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

371
00:22:56,726 --> 00:22:57,426
[SPEAKER_11]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

372
00:22:57,446 --> 00:22:57,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

373
00:22:58,746 --> 00:22:59,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guys.

374
00:22:59,086 --> 00:22:59,327
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up?

375
00:22:59,367 --> 00:22:59,967
[SPEAKER_07]: It's FootyMonster.

376
00:23:00,127 --> 00:23:00,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, FootyMonster.

377
00:23:00,987 --> 00:23:01,487
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

378
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:02,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing much.

379
00:23:02,968 --> 00:23:06,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually wanted to share with you guys something that I learned during the past day.

380
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:11,087
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hannah Montana game for the DS actually seems to be really good.

381
00:23:11,787 --> 00:23:12,287
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this?

382
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:15,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Hannah Montana, you know, that Disney show?

383
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:15,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, wait, wait.

384
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Hannah Montana for the DS is good?

385
00:23:20,151 --> 00:23:20,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

386
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Another one that's a platformer that's out already, but the one that's going to come out soon.

387
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:26,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, how do you know this?

388
00:23:27,094 --> 00:23:30,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I checked the video that was posted on DS Fanboy on Friday.

389
00:23:31,837 --> 00:23:39,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically the game is like jam sessions for the DS where you have the guitar, you can strum it and play chords and stuff.

390
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,202
[SPEAKER_07]: But take this to the next level where you can not only strum but also pick individual strings.

391
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:49,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Also you get a full drum kit in which you can actually play everything on the drum.

392
00:23:50,474 --> 00:23:54,637
[SPEAKER_07]: A bass guitar, and also you have connectivity with other DSs, and you can play on Wi-Fi.

393
00:23:54,677 --> 00:23:55,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Each person takes an instrument.

394
00:23:55,718 --> 00:23:56,999
[SPEAKER_07]: You can all jam together, actually.

395
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:58,940
[SPEAKER_11]: The chat room is all surprised that you're serious.

396
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:00,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm serious.

397
00:24:00,761 --> 00:24:01,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm completely serious.

398
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:08,007
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like Rock Band meets Jam Sessions with a really bad IP sticking on the front.

399
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:08,507
[SPEAKER_11]: I see.

400
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:12,650
[SPEAKER_11]: So Hannah Montana is a music game that looks to be really good, basically.

401
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:12,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

402
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,071
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a music game.

403
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:17,374
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not good because I don't get to punch her in the face or anything.

404
00:24:17,394 --> 00:24:18,675
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not what makes it good, right?

405
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:20,036
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a good game.

406
00:24:20,557 --> 00:24:20,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

407
00:24:21,838 --> 00:24:22,859
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems to be a good game.

408
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:31,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I actually called to Bobby Blackpool's show before and he said that he thinks that he heard that they might re-release

409
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:36,639
[SPEAKER_07]: without the IP, like the Hannah Montana IP slapped into it, like developers.

410
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,059
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be hilarious if they did that.

411
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:46,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you guys think of any other games that were like that, that were actually pretty good games that just had a crappy brand on it?

412
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:48,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to think if there's anything else.

413
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, surely there was something else in gaming history.

414
00:24:50,603 --> 00:24:52,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe the chat room can think of something.

415
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:58,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, was there a great concept for a game or a great game that just got totally screwed by the IP that was attached to it?

416
00:24:58,446 --> 00:24:59,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool Spot?

417
00:25:00,738 --> 00:25:01,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Spot, the video game?

418
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:02,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Cool Spot.

419
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, like all the way back in the NES days?

420
00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:05,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Super NES.

421
00:25:06,324 --> 00:25:07,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I don't remember that one.

422
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:10,668
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember the old board game one that was kind of like Othello.

423
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no, this is with the Spot from 7-Up.

424
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:14,633
[SPEAKER_09]: 7-Up, yeah.

425
00:25:15,193 --> 00:25:16,154
[SPEAKER_11]: So he had a game on the NES.

426
00:25:16,174 --> 00:25:16,915
[SPEAKER_05]: There were the Noid games.

427
00:25:16,955 --> 00:25:17,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, as a platformer.

428
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:18,577
[SPEAKER_11]: The Noid games?

429
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't he good?

430
00:25:19,658 --> 00:25:21,560
[SPEAKER_11]: They were actually kind of... They were...

431
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,192
[SPEAKER_05]: A good waste of time.

432
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:23,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh!

433
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:24,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Vector Man.

434
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:24,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Sneak King.

435
00:25:25,115 --> 00:25:25,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

436
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:26,799
[SPEAKER_11]: We did have one recently.

437
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,981
[SPEAKER_11]: But actually, I don't know.

438
00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:29,644
[SPEAKER_11]: The Burger King IP kind of made it, actually.

439
00:25:29,684 --> 00:25:29,965
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

440
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:31,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't say that was a bad IP.

441
00:25:31,828 --> 00:25:32,289
[SPEAKER_11]: But, huh.

442
00:25:33,174 --> 00:25:38,117
[SPEAKER_11]: And now I'm just curious about if High School Musical 2, the game, is going to be coming out any soon.

443
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:39,037
[SPEAKER_11]: I still have Shane's CD.

444
00:25:39,177 --> 00:25:42,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, High School Musical, the game, just came out in DS last week.

445
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:48,062
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's coming out, the karaoke game's coming out on PlayStation 2 and Wii in November.

446
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:53,185
[SPEAKER_05]: All I have to do is go to Disneyland and then run away from them while they chase me.

447
00:25:53,505 --> 00:25:55,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Footy Monster, I'm just shocked.

448
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:58,028
[SPEAKER_11]: A very unlikely recommendation for Hannah Montana.

449
00:25:58,068 --> 00:25:58,628
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

450
00:25:58,688 --> 00:26:01,410
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess this will truly put people to the test.

451
00:26:02,674 --> 00:26:03,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Is a good game.

452
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Is a good game a good game a good game no matter what?

453
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:15,523
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you remember though, they do have that special Disney like Xbox Live type service that's starting with the Hannah Montana 2 game too.

454
00:26:17,064 --> 00:26:20,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I just posted the link to the story and the video in chat.

455
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:21,987
[SPEAKER_07]: So just check it out for yourselves.

456
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:26,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean really, it's like I can tell you Hannah Montana seems to be a good game and you're probably going to laugh at me.

457
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,273
[SPEAKER_07]: But once you see that, actually look at people's reactions in the chat room.

458
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:33,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe that he's right.

459
00:26:33,322 --> 00:26:34,462
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks to be pretty cool.

460
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:37,944
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact that you can actually jam like it was Rock Band.

461
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:42,787
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like people said it's jam sessions for the DS mixed with Rock Band with a crap IP.

462
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:45,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Then how the fuck did Hannah Montana get her name on this?

463
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:46,049
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I want to know.

464
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:47,550
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at this right now.

465
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,672
[SPEAKER_11]: So wait, I'm going to play this little video here just because I can.

466
00:26:52,113 --> 00:26:53,633
[SPEAKER_11]: This is coming from DSFanboy.

467
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,454
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my cameraman.

468
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,221
[SPEAKER_11]: So where's this video?

469
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's going to stream a lot here.

470
00:26:58,862 --> 00:26:59,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me take a little bit.

471
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:02,183
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not going to be good.

472
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,184
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a kind of slow video.

473
00:27:04,224 --> 00:27:07,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why the person doesn't really show the game screen that much.

474
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:09,127
[SPEAKER_07]: They show the guy talking.

475
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:09,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know.

476
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:11,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to see the dude talking.

477
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:13,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to see the screen.

478
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:16,851
[SPEAKER_07]: But they show the screen a couple of times and you can get the feel of the game.

479
00:27:17,151 --> 00:27:24,075
[SPEAKER_07]: You can record up to two minutes, even if you're playing Wi-Fi, so you can actually record two minutes of something.

480
00:27:24,674 --> 00:27:28,278
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're recording with your buddies, and that kind of thing.

481
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:34,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So it seems to be pretty feature complete, which is kind of impressive.

482
00:27:34,924 --> 00:27:37,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Son of Dad says, the license kills this game.

483
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:39,368
[SPEAKER_11]: No hardcore gamer will buy this.

484
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:41,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I will buy it.

485
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:44,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you dare to defy.

486
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:47,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the best part, though.

487
00:27:47,356 --> 00:27:47,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, go ahead.

488
00:27:49,895 --> 00:27:56,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, if it's a game like this where, you know, it's not going to be that popular, it means it'll just be in a bargain bin pretty quick, and then you can pick it up.

489
00:27:57,981 --> 00:28:02,705
[SPEAKER_11]: But it might be popular because of the fact that, oh, he's like strumming the little guitar with the DS thing.

490
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:03,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

491
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:05,427
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of... Very interesting.

492
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:07,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk about gaming gems in the strangest places.

493
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:09,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, wow, there's like little drums, too.

494
00:28:18,547 --> 00:28:19,408
[SPEAKER_11]: That is something else.

495
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:21,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I might have to check that out.

496
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:27,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Real quickly before we let you go, I know you also co-host a podcast about strictly role-playing games, right?

497
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:28,980
[SPEAKER_07]: That is correct.

498
00:28:29,381 --> 00:28:30,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I allowed to plug it?

499
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:31,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you may plug it.

500
00:28:33,326 --> 00:28:34,788
[SPEAKER_07]: It's The Ultimate Quest.

501
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:36,590
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find it on ultimatequest.net.

502
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:41,397
[SPEAKER_07]: The next show is probably going to be released in the next few days, so yeah, there you go.

503
00:28:41,718 --> 00:28:45,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what I want to ask you about Ultimate Quest, I know Blue Dragon is coming out very soon.

504
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you excited about this?

505
00:28:46,581 --> 00:28:48,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's been getting some mixed reception from people.

506
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:52,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I would be excited about it if it wasn't for two reasons.

507
00:28:52,905 --> 00:29:02,851
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, one of the other co-hosts on the show, Jack Ransom, Shadowslayer, better known, he actually played the demo and also did Xenocore, and they both agreed that it's...

508
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:04,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Really nice looking.

509
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:08,841
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that the 360 doesn't really have in excess, which is like a traditional RPG.

510
00:29:09,341 --> 00:29:11,822
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's it.

511
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:18,865
[SPEAKER_07]: So that the whole thing that they look really like little kids will put off any hardcore 360 game.

512
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:22,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything that doesn't have a 360, so whatever.

513
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:23,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we'll see.

514
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:25,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyway, we've had John for a long time, so we've got to let you go.

515
00:29:26,268 --> 00:29:28,769
[SPEAKER_11]: But thanks so much for the call and for the tip on Hannah Montana.

516
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:29,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Who would have known?

517
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:30,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no worries.

518
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:31,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to spread the Montana love.

519
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:32,187
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

520
00:29:33,248 --> 00:29:33,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care.

521
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:34,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good flight.

522
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:36,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand you have a 14-hour flight tomorrow, so have a good flight.

523
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:36,991
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

524
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:37,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks a lot, man.

525
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:37,711
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

526
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:38,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

527
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:39,273
[SPEAKER_07]: See you.

528
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:39,773
[SPEAKER_11]: See you.

529
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:43,216
[SPEAKER_11]: He's breaking up a little bit there at the end, too, so it's probably for the best.

530
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:45,158
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll take one more call.

531
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:45,838
[SPEAKER_11]: One more call.

532
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:46,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

533
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:49,281
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody else decides to call in.

534
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:51,303
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number.

535
00:29:51,743 --> 00:29:54,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

536
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:55,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Waiting for it.

537
00:29:55,786 --> 00:29:56,326
[SPEAKER_11]: One more call.

538
00:29:56,486 --> 00:29:57,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Give it a second because of the buffer.

539
00:29:57,727 --> 00:29:59,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to see what else is going on in chat here.

540
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:01,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

541
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:05,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Joshi16 says he's pimping Montana out on the streets.

542
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:10,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Footy is back in chat saying that game will rock everybody's socks.

543
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:12,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

544
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:13,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks interesting, though.

545
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:17,126
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got some good screenshots on IGN or something.

546
00:30:17,826 --> 00:30:23,347
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's got a little too much sparkles and pink for my taste, but I don't know.

547
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:28,568
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that idea, though, that maybe the developers will release the game without the Hannah Montana IP, like it's a different game.

548
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:33,330
[SPEAKER_11]: HitStun says, you could say the GBA Astro Boy was brought down a little by its license.

549
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,930
[SPEAKER_11]: The original Astro Boy is hard to watch.

550
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Talking about IPs.

551
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,871
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, unfortunately, there's no other calls coming on the Skype line for right now.

552
00:30:40,567 --> 00:31:01,498
[SPEAKER_11]: and so we're going to go back to the news and just so you know the live listeners Live 365 may dump the show at any time unfortunately it will be inevitable we'll just have to keep going but we're going to keep recording tonight's show and of course you'll be able to hear the full thing and anything you might miss because of the Live 365 dump tonight you can certainly hear it on our podcast which you can download of course at

553
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:06,986
[SPEAKER_11]: We would have done the mailbag segment right now, but unfortunately we didn't get a whole lot of emails.

554
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:10,249
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you do want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelandradio.com.

555
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,412
[SPEAKER_11]: If you wanted to maybe call in tonight and get the chance to, you could always send us an email.

556
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,394
[SPEAKER_11]: And DarkSakura always reads through the emails.

557
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:17,114
[SPEAKER_05]: But not this week.

558
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:17,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

559
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:20,977
[SPEAKER_11]: And let us know what you think about Hannah Montana, the game.

560
00:31:21,257 --> 00:31:28,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially because I know there's a lot of music gaming fans that listen to this program because of our history that we did obviously a lot with music games in the past.

561
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:30,365
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a very interesting...

562
00:31:31,385 --> 00:31:36,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I think a lot of people have said in the past, you know, DDR is starting to look more and more like a game for little girls.

563
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:41,027
[SPEAKER_11]: This doesn't help the music gaming genre break out of that stereotype.

564
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:51,909
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, let's get back into some gaming news and talk about... We were talking a lot before we went to Skype about how Sony is kind of getting all these ideas from other places.

565
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:55,330
[SPEAKER_11]: At least it seems like, it feels like, and this story certainly doesn't help.

566
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,890
[SPEAKER_11]: You remember Africa and...

567
00:31:58,945 --> 00:32:01,206
[SPEAKER_11]: The game we saw at E3, what, a couple years ago?

568
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:04,347
[SPEAKER_11]: That, like, everybody looked at it going, what the fuck is that?

569
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:06,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we still don't know what the fuck that is.

570
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:07,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it Jamba Safari?

571
00:32:07,548 --> 00:32:08,908
[SPEAKER_11]: If so, that's fucking rad.

572
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:11,169
[SPEAKER_11]: A harpoon, me and Gazelle.

573
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:14,950
[SPEAKER_11]: But apparently the developer said you do not get to attack the animals in Africa.

574
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, they have said nothing about the game.

575
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,791
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are rumors.

576
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:22,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I must stress rumors because I think this sounds like a load of crap.

577
00:32:23,392 --> 00:32:25,713
[SPEAKER_11]: But the rumor is going out saying...

578
00:32:26,763 --> 00:32:37,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony is supposedly going to be releasing a Wii Fit type touchpad to go with Africa to make the Safari experience complete.

579
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:41,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Now my question is, how in the fuck does that work?

580
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:46,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you stand on it and then it just like shakes?

581
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:47,540
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Rhinoceros' approach?

582
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,561
[SPEAKER_11]: That makes no sense to me whatsoever.

583
00:32:50,182 --> 00:32:52,704
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I think this was totally pulled out of somebody's butt.

584
00:32:53,803 --> 00:32:58,527
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing, too, that's also suggesting that Africa is going to be out in, like, January.

585
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:03,431
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't think so, since we haven't heard anything about it.

586
00:33:04,132 --> 00:33:05,673
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's Africa.

587
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:08,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, could they delay it to maybe add something in?

588
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:09,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, who knows?

589
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:12,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it wouldn't be out before the Wii Fit, then, now would it?

590
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:12,719
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

591
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this kind of was an interesting story, but I do take it with a huge grain of salt.

592
00:33:18,484 --> 00:33:18,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

593
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:19,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Um.

594
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:42,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Something else that's interesting, part of EA's plan to totally dominate everything that exists in the world, they are now partnering up with Hasbro to release games based on their favorite properties, including Monopoly, Risk, and Scrabble, as well as toys including GI Joe, Tonka, Nerf, and Littlest Pet Shop.

595
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:45,025
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still doing Littlest Pet Shop?

596
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:47,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even realize there was a Littlest Pet Shop.

597
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:48,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

598
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:51,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay?

599
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:54,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, Nerf would be kind of neat.

600
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:56,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a first person shooter Nerf game.

601
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:58,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they actually have had that before.

602
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:00,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd put that in the category of good for them.

603
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if this means Monopoly on Xbox Live Arcade.

604
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:08,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what we really need.

605
00:34:08,572 --> 00:34:09,192
[SPEAKER_09]: That and Scrabble.

606
00:34:09,472 --> 00:34:14,614
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because then people will never stop playing because a Monopoly game on average takes about six hours.

607
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:16,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

608
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:20,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least you can't have someone cheat as the banker.

609
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:41,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of online games though, Park Associates, who is big for running those studies on online activities, said that there are 34% of adult users on the internet playing games as compared to 29% on YouTube and 19% on MySpace and Facebook.

610
00:34:44,714 --> 00:34:52,139
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have shown a 79% growth in online gaming over the year and only 46% in social networking.

611
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,681
[SPEAKER_05]: So we likes our games.

612
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:55,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep them going.

613
00:34:58,124 --> 00:35:03,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, though, I've noticed a lot of online games have that social aspect already combined with it.

614
00:35:04,248 --> 00:35:06,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'll tell you half the reason I used to play Ragnarok Online.

615
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:10,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally believe that casual games are as big as sometimes the hardcore gamers forget to admit.

616
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:40,083
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, because again, I use the example of walking around in the workplace and looking at little cubicles and so many people playing those freaking, you know, PopCap games like Collapse and what have you, you know, like it's an incredible business.

617
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:42,003
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not supposed to be doing that at work.

618
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:42,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they do.

619
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:44,324
[SPEAKER_11]: They can do it on their breaks.

620
00:35:45,164 --> 00:35:45,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Wink, wink.

621
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:47,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Not on our breaks at my work.

622
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:48,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's too bad.

623
00:35:48,285 --> 00:35:49,365
[SPEAKER_05]: We get stabbed in the head.

624
00:35:49,705 --> 00:35:49,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

625
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:51,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really.

626
00:35:51,486 --> 00:35:51,966
[SPEAKER_11]: That sucks.

627
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:52,886
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an HR issue.

628
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:59,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyway, this might be a future HR issue if you're caught playing this game at work.

629
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:01,101
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Super Chick Sisters!

630
00:36:01,795 --> 00:36:03,256
[SPEAKER_11]: You might have heard of this game this week.

631
00:36:03,336 --> 00:36:04,297
[SPEAKER_11]: It's from PETA.

632
00:36:04,617 --> 00:36:11,923
[SPEAKER_11]: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released this game called Super Chick Sisters as part of their website, KentuckyFriedCruelty.com.

633
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:14,225
[SPEAKER_11]: I played the game, and you know what?

634
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:16,386
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got to tell you, it's not bad.

635
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:19,149
[SPEAKER_11]: For a little homebrew cook-up title, it's not bad.

636
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:20,490
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's very tongue-in-cheek.

637
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,672
[SPEAKER_11]: It's obvious that the people who made the game know a little something about video games.

638
00:36:23,972 --> 00:36:25,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, like, okay, basically here it is.

639
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:30,818
[SPEAKER_11]: The premise of the video game, it's kind of like a Mario Brothers rip-off, but instead of Mario Brothers, you have a little chicken.

640
00:36:31,238 --> 00:36:31,758
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

641
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:58,386
[SPEAKER_11]: and Mario and Luigi are suffering from a case of Wii-itis.

642
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:00,929
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been playing too much Nintendo Wii, so their hands are broken.

643
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:06,375
[SPEAKER_11]: So they can't go rescue, so they have to rely on Chick and Nugget.

644
00:37:07,276 --> 00:37:08,998
[SPEAKER_11]: So you go through these Mario-type levels.

645
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:12,802
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of collecting coins, you collect these little birds, and then they give you little facts.

646
00:37:13,362 --> 00:37:14,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you play it?

647
00:37:14,704 --> 00:37:14,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish.

648
00:37:16,045 --> 00:37:16,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I did play it.

649
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:20,069
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wish more of my, like, Mario Brothers games would have that.

650
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:24,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, did you know that they chop the beaks off of chickens and don't even do anything?

651
00:37:25,554 --> 00:37:28,677
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, and did you realize that they boil them alive?

652
00:37:28,897 --> 00:37:30,258
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so horrible.

653
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:34,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you know that they put chickens in the incinerator and boil them?

654
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:36,604
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I was just like, this is amazing.

655
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:41,609
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm kind of, like, parking news, KFC tortures chickens.

656
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:47,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of me wants to invite PETA on this show, even though they are such a controversial organization.

657
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:49,960
[SPEAKER_11]: But part of me goes like, why did you do this?

658
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, why did you make a game out of this?

659
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:54,801
[SPEAKER_09]: You do realize there are copyright laws out there?

660
00:37:54,861 --> 00:38:01,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's like, they weren't at all like trying to say, oh, yeah, it's Larry and, you know.

661
00:38:02,586 --> 00:38:04,287
[SPEAKER_09]: and Barry or something.

662
00:38:05,007 --> 00:38:09,690
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Mario and Luigi and they have Toad in there and they use the Wii and they're not afraid about that.

663
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:14,132
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, at one point Mario gets beat up for being cruel to turtles.

664
00:38:15,052 --> 00:38:18,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, you played to level 3 to get that message, I know.

665
00:38:19,455 --> 00:38:25,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, level 3 was Mario gets beat up by the people for ethical treatment of turtles or something like that.

666
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:32,101
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's very tongue-in-cheek but it's funny and it's, you know, whether you agree or disagree with PETA

667
00:38:33,004 --> 00:38:36,125
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of an interesting way to get their message across.

668
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,987
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing I would want to ask PETA, and I swear I'm going to send them an email this week and try to get them on the show.

669
00:38:40,587 --> 00:38:47,089
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to know, why did they choose to make a game out of this to get their message?

670
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:53,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it because they want to get to that stereotype World of Warcraft player who's doing an all-night raid with a bucket of wings in his lap?

671
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:55,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they trying to get those guys to think twice?

672
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:56,873
[SPEAKER_09]: That game made me hungry.

673
00:38:58,173 --> 00:39:01,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a $5 gift certificate to KFC.

674
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:02,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking about...

675
00:39:03,072 --> 00:39:05,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Using me to get me some chicken.

676
00:39:05,196 --> 00:39:05,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

677
00:39:06,058 --> 00:39:09,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Even if you read all about the torturous ways of... This is kind of funny.

678
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:11,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of digging this game.

679
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:12,751
[SPEAKER_11]: It's interesting, isn't it?

680
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:13,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm big already.

681
00:39:13,913 --> 00:39:14,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so...

682
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:18,727
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkTetsuyu in chat says, Nintendo will sue.

683
00:39:19,267 --> 00:39:22,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Frisbee says, this makes me want KFC even more.

684
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:28,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Joshi16 says, but if it's for a good cause, they don't have to care about laws and restrictions.

685
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:30,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Just look at gross anti-smoking commercials.

686
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:33,796
[SPEAKER_11]: But my question is, you know, PIPEDA is a very controversial organization.

687
00:39:33,816 --> 00:39:34,456
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of

688
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:41,897
[SPEAKER_09]: And they may not want, yeah, they may not want their, especially, I don't think they gave, obviously they did not give them permission, you know, for this stuff.

689
00:39:42,038 --> 00:39:46,098
[SPEAKER_11]: It's sort of like, what's the business, is it Walmart that doesn't allow anybody out front of their store?

690
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:46,678
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's Target.

691
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:49,519
[SPEAKER_11]: Target does not allow anybody out front of their store, no matter who they are.

692
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it could be Girl Scouts or anything, they do not allow anybody out front of their store.

693
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,500
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just to be consistent policy.

694
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,341
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they don't want their name tied to any, you know, Republican, Democrat initiative or whatever it is.

695
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,082
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I think it's Target.

696
00:40:02,122 --> 00:40:03,782
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but...

697
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:06,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I sure as hell know it's not Walmart.

698
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:13,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe Nintendo wants to be like that where they don't want to be tied to any organization and I somehow doubt they were asked about this.

699
00:40:14,262 --> 00:40:19,726
[SPEAKER_11]: WonderDogHerald says PETA, as usual, likes to appeal to children for their tactics.

700
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:22,108
[SPEAKER_05]: People eating tasty animals.

701
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:24,850
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys keep saying stuff like that.

702
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,011
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to want to come on the show.

703
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:28,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I like chicken.

704
00:40:30,454 --> 00:40:32,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get the whole pipe level.

705
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:35,096
[SPEAKER_09]: That frustrated me and I turned it off.

706
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:37,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, level 3 was... I stopped at level 3 too.

707
00:40:37,637 --> 00:40:39,017
[SPEAKER_09]: It was too hard to figure out.

708
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:39,777
[SPEAKER_09]: A little over the top.

709
00:40:40,497 --> 00:40:41,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone needs some better level design.

710
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, for a homebrew game, which essentially it is, it's not bad.

711
00:40:44,899 --> 00:40:46,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's obvious a lot of effort went into this.

712
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,761
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't... That's what surprised me most about it is that it wasn't cheaply put together.

713
00:40:51,505 --> 00:40:52,986
[SPEAKER_11]: The Colonel with the Spider-Robot

714
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:21,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, Ubisoft is now talking about a brand new top secret game that they have in development that's going to be focusing on user-generated content.

715
00:41:21,388 --> 00:41:25,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess you could kind of compare it to LittleBigPlanet or something of that sort.

716
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:37,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, it will allow gamers to support their creations across platforms, sending out pie-in-the-sky meters, or apparently, according to Joyce, it's sending their pie-in-the-sky meters off the charts, but...

717
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:39,342
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

718
00:41:39,562 --> 00:41:39,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

719
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:47,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot more companies are going to start taking this stance and allowing more user created content instead of banning that.

720
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:50,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at Forza 2 with the whole creating cars.

721
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:53,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo 3 with the new videos that they're uploading.

722
00:41:53,747 --> 00:41:56,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, even before that with Burnout.

723
00:41:56,468 --> 00:42:00,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Revenge where you can upload your gameplay footage and stuff.

724
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:02,530
[SPEAKER_09]: SingStar where you're going to be able to do the same thing.

725
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that we're probably going to see more of.

726
00:42:09,637 --> 00:42:09,937
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

727
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:17,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, DarkSakura likes to surf the Internet up and down every single week and choose a website of her liking to share with all of you.

728
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:20,005
[SPEAKER_11]: And we call it her website of the week.

729
00:42:20,025 --> 00:42:22,767
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm curious what DarkSakura has picked out for the kids this week.

730
00:42:23,148 --> 00:42:24,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's play the music and see.

731
00:42:32,015 --> 00:42:35,218
[SPEAKER_05]: The website of the week is PETAKillsAnimals.com.

732
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,120
[SPEAKER_05]: What, Rob?

733
00:42:38,954 --> 00:42:41,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh boy, there went our chances of getting PETA on the show.

734
00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:53,040
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically... Actually, their most recent news were about the recent PETA trial in North Carolina for animal cruelty.

735
00:42:53,500 --> 00:43:02,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they had to submit the numbers of the amount of animals that they had actually killed involved in their research.

736
00:43:03,404 --> 00:43:04,605
[SPEAKER_05]: They have, on their...

737
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:08,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I remembered some of this from being on Penn & Teller's Bullshit recently.

738
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:10,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Great show, by the way.

739
00:43:12,243 --> 00:43:19,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Where one of the charges on their inventories was for a walk-in freezer that cost $9,370.

740
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:25,863
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Vegetables?

741
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:44,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no.

742
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:46,623
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of frozen peas.

743
00:43:46,663 --> 00:43:52,245
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was just quite a bit on here about exactly what they spelled.

744
00:43:52,485 --> 00:43:58,348
[SPEAKER_05]: The head of PETA is actually on, you know how they say, oh, well, don't use this medication because it was tested on animals?

745
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:09,434
[SPEAKER_05]: The head of PETA is actually on insulin that was, the research was done on animal testing and derived from animal products.

746
00:44:11,017 --> 00:44:12,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought it was very interesting.

747
00:44:13,339 --> 00:44:15,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much a company run by hypocrites, but well.

748
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:22,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess we always have to have a counterpoint to every point made on the show, so there you have it.

749
00:44:23,567 --> 00:44:27,891
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anyhow, let's talk a little bit about Squeenix.

750
00:44:28,652 --> 00:44:37,479
[SPEAKER_11]: We love Square Enix, and they are opening their brand new store online on August 20th, and they even have a time, 6 p.m.

751
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:38,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Pacific time.

752
00:44:38,456 --> 00:44:46,863
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be a brand new online shop opening up and it's supposed to have Square Enix collectibles, model kits, and clothing accessories.

753
00:44:47,463 --> 00:44:51,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wonder if that means buttons or if you'll be able to buy full cosplay on the website.

754
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:52,387
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be pretty awesome.

755
00:44:53,628 --> 00:44:58,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably some of those Final Fantasy XII action figures like the Balthier one, which I have.

756
00:44:58,111 --> 00:45:01,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Balthier is very awesome in Final Fantasy XII.

757
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:05,406
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're a Square Enix fan, I'm sure you're going to be hitting up their website on August 20, 2007.

758
00:45:06,006 --> 00:45:16,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, I don't recall exactly where the website is located, but I'm sure if you go to Square Enix's website at squareenix.com, there'll be a link right there when the store opens.

759
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:17,520
[SPEAKER_11]: So be on the lookout for it.

760
00:45:18,702 --> 00:45:20,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if in case you're wondering...

761
00:45:22,507 --> 00:45:25,929
[SPEAKER_09]: What those large hard drives are for on the PlayStation 3?

762
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:27,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, wonder no more.

763
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:34,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, they are going to be releasing a digital tuner for recording TV.

764
00:45:35,634 --> 00:45:40,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's supposed to be unveiled at LibZig here pretty soon.

765
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:47,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So this has been confirmed by 3Speech, their semi-official blog for Sony.

766
00:45:50,342 --> 00:45:50,742
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

767
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:51,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

768
00:45:52,358 --> 00:46:00,542
[SPEAKER_05]: In other news, they are talking about the chip manufacturers that are behind the Wii shortage.

769
00:46:01,363 --> 00:46:08,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo wants to up production from what I'm understanding, but they are not able to get the chips they need still.

770
00:46:09,107 --> 00:46:16,971
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones who are making the components are saying that if it keeps up like that, they're not going to be able to keep up with the demand.

771
00:46:19,473 --> 00:46:20,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not surprised.

772
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,461
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

773
00:46:23,921 --> 00:46:29,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, talking about electronic arts for a minute, going on over to Macintosh Gaming.

774
00:46:31,086 --> 00:46:35,510
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Mac sometimes gets a bad rap because they don't really have a lot of games on it.

775
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:40,253
[SPEAKER_11]: But you might have heard early in the year, EA is supposed to be, you know, kind of helping out a little bit more.

776
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:44,596
[SPEAKER_11]: And EA has actually shipped four games for the Macintosh.

777
00:46:45,197 --> 00:46:53,002
[SPEAKER_11]: They've shipped Battlefield 2142, Need for Speed Carbon, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars.

778
00:46:53,322 --> 00:46:58,206
[SPEAKER_11]: So for those of you saying there are no games available on the Mac, well, there's four pretty big titles right there, especially Command & Conquer 3.

779
00:46:58,246 --> 00:46:59,627
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people love their Command & Conquer games.

780
00:46:59,867 --> 00:47:00,527
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you have it.

781
00:47:00,547 --> 00:47:07,390
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, I got a message earlier this week online asking if I played Command & Conquer, if I wanted to play, and I said, no, you'd have to ask Loki, because I don't really play that.

782
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have Command & Conquer 3, so there you have it.

783
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:10,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to play it, though.

784
00:47:11,631 --> 00:47:13,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, let's see.

785
00:47:14,512 --> 00:47:22,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, there's been some interesting stuff going on in the whole EA Wikipedia article there.

786
00:47:22,595 --> 00:47:29,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, some EA staffers have been changing a little bit of history on there, removing key facts.

787
00:47:29,755 --> 00:47:30,836
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

788
00:47:57,248 --> 00:48:10,139
[SPEAKER_09]: EA did come out and say they sometimes update websites with info about company, games, and employees.

789
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:16,385
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, EA has sent a correction to Yahoo Finance when they had misspelled the name of an EA executive.

790
00:48:16,874 --> 00:48:23,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Many companies routinely post updates on websites like Wikipedia to ensure accuracy of their own corporate information.

791
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:33,827
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I think deleting information that is negative about your company's past is not exactly, I don't know, following that.

792
00:48:34,228 --> 00:48:35,949
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically just... Poor ethics.

793
00:48:36,189 --> 00:48:38,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's hiding the bad spots.

794
00:48:39,552 --> 00:48:43,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, Wikipedia doesn't allow you to edit an article that's up about yourself, right?

795
00:48:43,695 --> 00:48:46,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, in fact, that is a major violation...

796
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:46,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

797
00:48:47,702 --> 00:48:49,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, for instance, I don't touch the OLR article.

798
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:54,701
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there is an Orange Lounge Radio article on Wikipedia how it survived this long against their, you know...

799
00:48:55,123 --> 00:48:57,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Notability Rules, I have no idea, but hey, it's there.

800
00:48:57,884 --> 00:49:02,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably because, I guess, since we were lucky enough to have the news articles, then there's been other sources about us, but whatever.

801
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:08,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never touched the article, although I'm always fascinated reading the updates and the work that other people have put into it.

802
00:49:08,906 --> 00:49:13,247
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just won't touch it because I'm like, well, that's kind of weird.

803
00:49:13,267 --> 00:49:17,267
[SPEAKER_11]: There's things I want to go fix in it, like some of the shows that aren't on anymore.

804
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,488
[SPEAKER_05]: I've fixed grammatical errors.

805
00:49:18,928 --> 00:49:19,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you?

806
00:49:19,508 --> 00:49:19,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I have.

807
00:49:20,048 --> 00:49:20,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I guess that's different.

808
00:49:20,988 --> 00:49:24,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Grammatical errors is one thing, but I don't touch it because, I don't know, it's weird.

809
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:28,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Some folks in chat are saying, you're welcome, you're welcome.

810
00:49:29,522 --> 00:49:33,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Joshi16 says, Wikipedia is becoming corporate propaganda machine.

811
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:34,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

812
00:49:35,504 --> 00:50:04,727
[SPEAKER_11]: interesting perspective you know that's not the only Wikipedia thing I read about this week I heard that the was it the ESA supposedly was going on to Wikipedia and had edited some articles on like Abandonware and stuff too and they were deleting things like there's some IPs traced back I want to say I read something about that I think I remember that too yeah so kind of interesting all this Wikipedia information that's come out this week I think ours needs a bit of an update I was just looking at it yeah it probably needs a small update but I don't want to do it myself so maybe a kind listener will go in there and clean it up we'll see

813
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:10,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, let's see.

814
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:16,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, I had a little bit of news in regards to stuff coming out on the Virtual Console and the PSP.

815
00:50:17,203 --> 00:50:17,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

816
00:50:18,743 --> 00:50:22,264
[SPEAKER_05]: There is actually a Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest.

817
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:25,545
[SPEAKER_05]: It has actually been rated for a Wii release.

818
00:50:26,246 --> 00:50:31,587
[SPEAKER_05]: And LucasArts is bringing out Indiana Jones to the PSP, tentatively titled as Indiana Jones 2008.

819
00:50:31,627 --> 00:50:32,247
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not Lego.

820
00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:39,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I wonder if it's based on the old Indiana Jones arcade game.

821
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,950
[SPEAKER_09]: That game was pretty awesome.

822
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:44,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they did have, was it that Indiana Jones game that was being worked on by LucasArts?

823
00:50:44,892 --> 00:50:47,932
[SPEAKER_09]: The one that was supposed to be all, you know... That was the Indiana Jones 2008.

824
00:50:48,093 --> 00:50:51,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but still, this could be something like that.

825
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:55,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe tying in with the new Indiana Jones movie.

826
00:50:56,195 --> 00:50:56,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

827
00:50:56,455 --> 00:50:57,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

828
00:50:57,696 --> 00:50:59,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Harrison Ford is too old.

829
00:51:00,236 --> 00:51:01,037
[SPEAKER_09]: He's never too old.

830
00:51:01,217 --> 00:51:02,157
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll make him a robot.

831
00:51:02,317 --> 00:51:05,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess if Bruce Willis can do it, Harrison Ford can.

832
00:51:08,018 --> 00:51:09,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Dementium, The War Dementium

833
00:51:34,902 --> 00:51:40,465
[SPEAKER_11]: and I guess it's actually based off an independent title by Renegade Kid.

834
00:51:41,585 --> 00:51:51,590
[SPEAKER_11]: And Dementium is a mature rated game and it looks like it's going to be kind of like that type Silent Hill horror type game.

835
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually thinking of the Call of Cthulhu game.

836
00:51:55,552 --> 00:52:02,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, remember they have that one was a Touch the Dead a while back that was also a mature rated title that was more of a shooter, but...

837
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:07,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I think around the same site, Insecticides was coming out on the DS as well, so that one was pretty cool.

838
00:52:07,642 --> 00:52:12,443
[SPEAKER_09]: That was that adventure game that was kind of film noir, but with insects.

839
00:52:12,943 --> 00:52:16,885
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't see a lot of survival horror on the DS, so kind of interesting.

840
00:52:17,005 --> 00:52:17,485
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks good.

841
00:52:19,105 --> 00:52:25,748
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't seen too much on this game, but I'm always interested in more survival horror games, because they always succeed in scaring the pants off of me.

842
00:52:26,328 --> 00:52:27,048
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there you have it.

843
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:28,505
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

844
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:50,677
[SPEAKER_11]: until we get booted.

845
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:52,718
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if any more calls will come in, but we'll see.

846
00:52:53,078 --> 00:52:53,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

847
00:52:53,998 --> 00:52:55,079
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got some last-minute stories.

848
00:52:55,439 --> 00:53:05,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Ninja Gaiden 2 is going to be debuting on the Xbox 360, and with PlayStation 3 coming later on, it's supposed to debut at Tokyo Game Show.

849
00:53:05,404 --> 00:53:08,145
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the rumor coming from GameSpot Korea.

850
00:53:08,906 --> 00:53:10,887
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'll be interesting to check that out.

851
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:13,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see here.

852
00:53:14,621 --> 00:53:18,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo 3, of course, nearing completion, almost gold right now.

853
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:24,451
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's been some interesting details on this new Bungie Pro program that's going to be happening.

854
00:53:24,971 --> 00:53:35,341
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically what Bungie Pro is, is it's going to be a... Anyone that has a copy of Halo 3 and a gold subscription will be allocated six slots...

855
00:53:35,888 --> 00:53:36,808
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

856
00:53:57,742 --> 00:53:58,322
[SPEAKER_09]: DecaSporta Volleyball

857
00:54:23,956 --> 00:54:25,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see what else here.

858
00:54:25,556 --> 00:54:33,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Halo the movie has been apparently reconfirmed that it's coming and is apparently already filming in New Zealand.

859
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:34,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Bullshit.

860
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:36,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.

861
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:38,880
[SPEAKER_09]: This is coming from XboxFamily.com.

862
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,581
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't believe it, but we'll see.

863
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:45,242
[SPEAKER_09]: That it?

864
00:54:45,402 --> 00:54:46,122
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one other thing.

865
00:54:46,162 --> 00:54:47,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard some interesting stuff this week.

866
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:50,863
[SPEAKER_09]: A game I did not realize was coming out this fall.

867
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:53,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, was it...

868
00:54:55,103 --> 00:54:58,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Kingdom of Fire, Circle of Doom is supposed to be coming out in early December.

869
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:01,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that was coming out in 2008.

870
00:55:02,337 --> 00:55:04,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of upcoming games, what have you heard about Two Worlds?

871
00:55:05,114 --> 00:55:05,294
[SPEAKER_09]: RAD RAD

872
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:34,915
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, the day and night cycles are supposed to be pretty cool.

873
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:38,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And, I don't know, it's kind of like Oblivion, but it's all third person.

874
00:55:39,217 --> 00:55:42,619
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't really know much beyond that.

875
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:46,461
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks cool, but I think, unfortunately, it's coming out the same week as Bioshock.

876
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:47,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it would have been.

877
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:48,521
[SPEAKER_09]: It speaks to a different audience.

878
00:55:48,561 --> 00:55:52,823
[SPEAKER_09]: It originally was supposed to come out last week, which would have been perfect, because it's Madden and that.

879
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:56,385
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that would have been a pretty good game to pick up if you're not into Madden.

880
00:55:57,162 --> 00:55:58,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Star Parodia Star Soldier Star Parodia

881
00:56:22,605 --> 00:56:23,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioshock PC Demo

882
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:35,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

883
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe I'll get Bioshock for the PC over the 360.

884
00:57:02,972 --> 00:57:03,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

885
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:05,314
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, I want achievement points because I'm an achievement player.

886
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:06,736
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's going to run that well on PC.

887
00:57:07,076 --> 00:57:08,337
[SPEAKER_11]: At least not on our PCs.

888
00:57:08,357 --> 00:57:09,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not on my PC.

889
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:09,718
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

890
00:57:10,579 --> 00:57:12,581
[SPEAKER_11]: One other thing to speak about here.

891
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:17,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo Power has apparently given Metroid Prime 3 a 10 out of 10.

892
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:19,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow!

893
00:57:19,306 --> 00:57:19,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

894
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:22,809
[SPEAKER_09]: A Nintendo run magazine giving their game a 10 out of 10?

895
00:57:22,869 --> 00:57:24,471
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so surprising.

896
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:28,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Now hold on because something that the story notes is that

897
00:57:28,502 --> 00:57:37,805
[SPEAKER_11]: You may or may not remember, but Ocarina of Time only got a 9.5 from Nintendo Power, so the fact they gave this a 10 out of 10 does make your eyebrow race a little bit.

898
00:57:37,825 --> 00:57:40,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow, okay, so a 9.5, because that's really different than a 10.

899
00:57:42,686 --> 00:57:46,468
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost perfect, but Metroid, that's perfect.

900
00:57:46,848 --> 00:57:51,189
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, really, do you think they would have to sell more of Ocarina of Time?

901
00:57:51,209 --> 00:57:56,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think that game sells itself, whereas Metroid Prime, you know, maybe it needs a little help to be...

902
00:57:57,678 --> 00:57:58,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Selling some of those units.

903
00:58:23,802 --> 00:58:27,464
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of folks are giving Bioshock, of course, very high scores.

904
00:58:27,484 --> 00:58:32,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Joshi16 in chat is pointing out that Bioshock got a 10 out of 10 from the original Xbox magazine.

905
00:58:32,787 --> 00:58:33,767
[SPEAKER_11]: But is that really a shock?

906
00:58:34,688 --> 00:58:34,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it?

907
00:58:35,248 --> 00:58:35,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

908
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:40,310
[SPEAKER_11]: NintendoManiac64 says Ocarina of Time's negative .5 was from Navi.

909
00:58:41,211 --> 00:58:41,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen!

910
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:42,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen!

911
00:58:43,632 --> 00:58:44,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Listen, goddammit, listen!

912
00:58:46,373 --> 00:58:46,653
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

913
00:58:47,294 --> 00:58:49,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that pretty much does it for all the stories tonight.

914
00:58:50,355 --> 00:58:51,736
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really think we have anything else.

915
00:58:52,998 --> 00:58:55,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I opened up the Skype line and told the chat they could call in.

916
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:57,340
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give one more shout if you guys want to get through.

917
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,262
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877, because I guess they're still live and still going.

918
00:59:02,282 --> 00:59:06,064
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

919
00:59:07,765 --> 00:59:08,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Call!

920
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:09,365
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

921
00:59:10,306 --> 00:59:12,107
[SPEAKER_11]: If not... Ah, there we go.

922
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:13,167
[SPEAKER_11]: We're getting some calls now.

923
00:59:14,027 --> 00:59:14,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Just takes a little bit.

924
00:59:15,348 --> 00:59:16,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

925
00:59:16,268 --> 00:59:16,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

926
00:59:17,689 --> 00:59:18,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend of Saku.

927
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:20,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, see, because you missed the first wave.

928
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:21,751
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind, Saku?

929
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:24,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I just came back from 8 on the break.

930
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:26,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a little 2DX tournament today.

931
00:59:28,033 --> 00:59:30,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Managed to beat some chumps and, you know, distorted.

932
00:59:30,755 --> 00:59:33,056
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Champions of the Coast wasn't so bad this weekend.

933
00:59:34,077 --> 00:59:36,799
[SPEAKER_11]: You were always going to some tournament on the East Coast, it seems like.

934
00:59:37,779 --> 00:59:39,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it was my first 2DX tournament.

935
00:59:39,761 --> 00:59:41,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, well, how was the 2DX tournament set up?

936
00:59:42,022 --> 00:59:42,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it fun?

937
00:59:43,483 --> 00:59:44,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was pretty good.

938
00:59:44,544 --> 00:59:45,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there weren't, you know...

939
00:59:46,431 --> 00:59:46,871
[SPEAKER_03]: B-Mania 2DX Player

940
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:08,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, man.

941
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,421
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.

942
01:00:11,022 --> 01:00:15,566
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's anything that would make that whole weekend is just seeing a 2DX freestyle.

943
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:17,527
[SPEAKER_11]: A 2DX freestyle?

944
01:00:18,288 --> 01:00:18,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

945
01:00:18,788 --> 01:00:19,429
[SPEAKER_03]: How did that work?

946
01:00:19,469 --> 01:00:26,614
[SPEAKER_03]: The break is the only place where you can freestyle any of their music or dancing machines.

947
01:00:27,475 --> 01:00:28,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, who did that and what did they do?

948
01:00:30,057 --> 01:00:35,901
[SPEAKER_03]: They did Tangerine Stream, some sort of homoerotic stuff.

949
01:00:36,061 --> 01:00:36,962
[SPEAKER_03]: No offense, but that's

950
01:00:37,725 --> 01:00:38,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

951
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:14,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I'm just thinking about a 360, but since, you know, the failure rate's too high, I don't know if Bioshock or anything like, you know, Halo 3 Gears of War would just be, would just outweigh all the risk in just buying a 360 in the first place.

952
01:01:14,774 --> 01:01:21,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, you're the second caller tonight to tell us that the failure rate issues are making you contemplate the 360.

953
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:21,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude.

954
01:01:21,899 --> 01:01:22,880
[SPEAKER_03]: That's making me nervous.

955
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,901
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

956
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:26,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And God forbid a PS3.

957
01:01:27,023 --> 01:01:28,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know I don't want to pick the latter.

958
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:31,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really have that much of a choice right now.

959
01:01:34,262 --> 01:01:44,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Has a person who personally owns multiple Xbox 360 systems and has never had one crap out for heat issues... I don't know what the hell people are talking about.

960
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:45,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously...

961
01:01:46,923 --> 01:01:54,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, maybe you may have the unlikely situation where your system craps out.

962
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:54,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Who gives a shit?

963
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:57,795
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a fucking three-year warranty on the heat-related issues.

964
01:01:58,195 --> 01:01:59,717
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets replaced within a couple weeks.

965
01:02:00,138 --> 01:02:00,918
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the issue.

966
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:07,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get why Sony can make a PS3 that craps out at a blue moon and 360s is like what?

967
01:02:18,303 --> 01:02:19,584
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

968
01:02:43,684 --> 01:02:46,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to play out the horror stories of having to go through 8, 10 consoles.

969
01:03:07,025 --> 01:03:07,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to get it right.

970
01:03:07,806 --> 01:03:11,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just retarded to just have to go through multiple consoles.

971
01:03:12,013 --> 01:03:12,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

972
01:03:12,553 --> 01:03:13,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up for a minute.

973
01:03:14,076 --> 01:03:15,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Not you, Zach, but Loki.

974
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:21,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I did have an Xbox 360 that did crap out on me after four days, and I was so fucking pissed when it happened.

975
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:22,849
[SPEAKER_11]: You remember on this program, I was...

976
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:26,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you fucking buy 360 because they'll fucking die on you, blah, blah, blah.

977
01:03:27,032 --> 01:03:29,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I was so pissed when it happened, but I'm over it.

978
01:03:29,534 --> 01:03:30,855
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they were quick.

979
01:03:31,115 --> 01:03:32,957
[SPEAKER_11]: They got the job done.

980
01:03:33,317 --> 01:03:34,738
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it didn't take two or three weeks.

981
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:35,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I had it back in a week.

982
01:03:35,398 --> 01:03:35,959
[SPEAKER_03]: They paid for shipping?

983
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:37,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they paid for everything.

984
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they pay for shipping?

985
01:03:40,135 --> 01:03:41,955
[SPEAKER_03]: They sent me a box.

986
01:03:42,255 --> 01:03:44,596
[SPEAKER_11]: They sent me a coffin to send it back in.

987
01:03:44,796 --> 01:03:46,076
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard they don't do that anymore.

988
01:03:46,477 --> 01:03:47,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they still do.

989
01:03:47,297 --> 01:03:47,817
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.

990
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:50,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I have to incur charges.

991
01:03:50,198 --> 01:03:52,038
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to incur any charges.

992
01:03:52,058 --> 01:03:54,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you're talking about like they're going to have to replace the system eight times.

993
01:03:54,979 --> 01:03:58,220
[SPEAKER_09]: If that were the case, they wouldn't be selling millions of fucking consoles.

994
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,401
[SPEAKER_03]: This wouldn't be like a hot selling item.

995
01:04:01,301 --> 01:04:03,602
[SPEAKER_03]: You already have that happening to certain people.

996
01:04:03,802 --> 01:04:05,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what the problem is.

997
01:04:05,443 --> 01:04:11,407
[SPEAKER_09]: You hear fucking idiots on the goddamn internet that bitch like fucking little babies about their fucking console breaking.

998
01:04:11,667 --> 01:04:14,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's like, oh my god, all of them are breaking all at once.

999
01:04:15,269 --> 01:04:16,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give me that bullshit.

1000
01:04:16,209 --> 01:04:17,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a migraine now.

1001
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:18,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1002
01:04:19,331 --> 01:04:20,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, hold on.

1003
01:04:21,252 --> 01:04:26,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's my other thought though, is that what about that the new Xbox 360s have like the new chips in them or whatever?

1004
01:04:27,105 --> 01:04:29,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's yet to be seen.

1005
01:04:29,206 --> 01:04:41,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if those break out less, you know, like, you know, once in a blue moon or very, very rare, then I'll hop on it, you know, at the drop of a hat.

1006
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what.

1007
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:43,231
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you what.

1008
01:04:46,032 --> 01:04:48,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you what, fine, you can go ahead and skip buying a 360.

1009
01:04:49,074 --> 01:04:50,214
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll enjoy playing Bioshock.

1010
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:53,136
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go ahead and wait for the next big game to come out for the PlayStation 3.

1011
01:04:53,276 --> 01:04:54,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it'll be next year sometime.

1012
01:04:54,777 --> 01:04:57,879
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say he could get it on PC, but he has a Mac, right?

1013
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:03,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm building a new PC anyway, so that's going to be happening in a few days once I start ordering the parts.

1014
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:06,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already set aside a good $1,500, $1,600 for.

1015
01:05:08,932 --> 01:05:16,436
[SPEAKER_03]: The PC can hold me for now, and then hopefully by Christmas, once we know whether the new heatsinks will actually make a difference, then I'll think about it.

1016
01:05:16,456 --> 01:05:19,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the PC might hold you, but will it give it the reach around?

1017
01:05:20,518 --> 01:05:20,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

1018
01:05:20,638 --> 01:05:20,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1019
01:05:21,219 --> 01:05:23,200
[SPEAKER_00]: La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

1020
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:31,844
[SPEAKER_11]: And on that note, look, Zaku, I appreciate the Springer-fied call this show got, but we appreciate the perspective.

1021
01:05:32,164 --> 01:05:32,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1022
01:05:32,364 --> 01:05:33,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Zaku.

1023
01:05:33,565 --> 01:05:33,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Time's up.

1024
01:05:34,383 --> 01:05:34,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care though.

1025
01:05:34,946 --> 01:05:35,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1026
01:05:37,651 --> 01:05:38,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I can have new cars?

1027
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:44,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, people talking about fucking heat sinks and issues with a couple of... This is more than just Zaku, though.

1028
01:05:44,992 --> 01:05:51,233
[SPEAKER_11]: This is your pent-up anger at all the internet blogs and people across the entire internet that have made people like Zaku.

1029
01:05:51,253 --> 01:05:53,154
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what the fuck they want.

1030
01:05:53,194 --> 01:05:56,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they've already made revisions to fix this problem.

1031
01:05:56,514 --> 01:05:58,295
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a three-year fucking warranty on it.

1032
01:05:58,615 --> 01:05:59,995
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell more do you want?

1033
01:06:00,115 --> 01:06:04,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if your Sony PlayStation 3 craps out on you, good luck getting it fixed.

1034
01:06:04,716 --> 01:06:04,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1035
01:06:05,433 --> 01:06:08,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it could, like, do my dishes, I don't know, it'd be pretty awesome.

1036
01:06:08,075 --> 01:06:10,516
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it's just, it's stupid, it really is.

1037
01:06:10,576 --> 01:06:12,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, another call, one more call, then this is it.

1038
01:06:13,138 --> 01:06:14,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1039
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, it's Paradox Vincent.

1040
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:19,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Paradox Vincent, what's on your mind?

1041
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:24,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, long time no see, chat.

1042
01:06:25,446 --> 01:06:30,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Not much, just calling in after a while, haven't been able to really listen to the show live, but...

1043
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:34,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally got to sit down and talk to you guys again.

1044
01:06:35,182 --> 01:06:35,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what's up?

1045
01:06:35,822 --> 01:06:37,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Was there a story tonight you wanted to comment on?

1046
01:06:40,144 --> 01:06:44,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I did play the Kentucky Fried Cruelty Chicken game.

1047
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:46,105
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty good.

1048
01:06:46,485 --> 01:06:53,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely better than a lot of charity organizations putting up web games on there.

1049
01:06:53,868 --> 01:06:55,008
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun and stuff.

1050
01:06:55,852 --> 01:07:02,894
[SPEAKER_11]: It was certainly better than most politically-oriented games, and even better than a lot of homebrew, which... Oh, I can't believe... I'm so sorry, ParadoxVincent.

1051
01:07:02,914 --> 01:07:04,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got to go on a tangent for a minute.

1052
01:07:04,074 --> 01:07:04,595
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, it's fine.

1053
01:07:04,615 --> 01:07:11,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you hear about the homebrew that was on the DS that was like, avoid the gay mob, or whatever it is?

1054
01:07:12,297 --> 01:07:12,877
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1055
01:07:13,257 --> 01:07:19,799
[SPEAKER_11]: You control the little character, and then if you get hit by the mob, it goes, oh, you got hit by a gay person, game over.

1056
01:07:19,859 --> 01:07:20,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's huge.

1057
01:07:20,399 --> 01:07:22,940
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been hitting all these websites.

1058
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,222
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's like, oh my gosh, homophobia in the homebrew scene.

1059
01:07:26,603 --> 01:07:30,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and I just kind of read it going, you know, well, there's idiots everywhere.

1060
01:07:30,145 --> 01:07:37,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And the unfortunate thing is, is that when you give this guy attention, unfortunately, more people are going to seek this game out and play it.

1061
01:07:37,651 --> 01:07:45,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just people who like, you know, gay guys who want to play it and laugh at it for being stupid, which, you know, I admit I was tempted to do, but I didn't.

1062
01:07:45,316 --> 01:07:51,561
[SPEAKER_11]: But then you're also going to have people that inadvertently read about this through sites like, you know, MTV or whatever, that report on it going, you know,

1063
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I do kind of, you know, I do hate gays.

1064
01:07:54,895 --> 01:08:00,258
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to play this game and I want to find this guy who made this game and help him make a better game, you know, and just, I don't know.

1065
01:08:00,598 --> 01:08:03,800
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we should give these kinds of things any attention whatsoever.

1066
01:08:04,641 --> 01:08:08,443
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe I shouldn't have said anything about it at all, but I just thought the whole thing was very interesting.

1067
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:10,084
[SPEAKER_11]: And the homebrew was really bad.

1068
01:08:10,385 --> 01:08:11,105
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really bad.

1069
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:12,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, sorry, Paradox.

1070
01:08:12,406 --> 01:08:13,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Really bad homebrew?

1071
01:08:13,126 --> 01:08:14,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's really bad.

1072
01:08:14,587 --> 01:08:16,608
[SPEAKER_11]: So, okay, back to the PETA game.

1073
01:08:16,668 --> 01:08:18,470
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think was their motivations for making it?

1074
01:08:20,411 --> 01:08:20,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1075
01:08:21,676 --> 01:08:34,160
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's either what you said in trying to kind of target the video game playing audience and tell them, hey, you know, Kentucky Fried Chicken is bad.

1076
01:08:34,801 --> 01:08:46,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Or really, they could have just been seeking out a new media to get their message out and then they noticed that, you know, web games are pretty popular.

1077
01:08:46,965 --> 01:08:47,105
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1078
01:08:48,857 --> 01:08:49,858
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1079
01:09:17,364 --> 01:09:23,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Why, why did they, I mean, if they chose to do this to do, to connect with a gaming audience, it kind of worked, didn't it?

1080
01:09:23,889 --> 01:09:31,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, like, you know, all the major gaming blogs reported on it, and I probably would have never heard of this game had it not been posted, you know, like all these different blogs are on the internet.

1081
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:35,317
[SPEAKER_11]: So, in a way, it kind of worked, and it kind of did get their message out there, huh?

1082
01:09:35,457 --> 01:09:35,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

1083
01:09:36,698 --> 01:09:37,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Real quick, sorry.

1084
01:09:38,726 --> 01:09:41,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It got the attention because it's on all these game blogs.

1085
01:09:41,929 --> 01:09:44,671
[SPEAKER_09]: You know they're going to get a cease and desist for this.

1086
01:09:45,131 --> 01:09:47,132
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be even more attention for them.

1087
01:09:47,532 --> 01:09:48,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they will.

1088
01:09:48,553 --> 01:09:49,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they will.

1089
01:09:49,634 --> 01:09:50,214
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll see.

1090
01:09:51,935 --> 01:09:52,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't know.

1091
01:09:53,276 --> 01:09:54,637
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1092
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Paradox Vincent?

1093
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, two things, and I'll try to get them done real quick.

1094
01:10:00,601 --> 01:10:03,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick Guitar Hero 80s review.

1095
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:04,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Great song list.

1096
01:10:05,004 --> 01:10:07,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I love almost every song in there.

1097
01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:15,965
[SPEAKER_06]: and it gave me a couple new favorite songs, but they're just really kind of not great charts.

1098
01:10:16,765 --> 01:10:29,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially the Turning Japanese chart was really boring, but I guess it's Activision's first real take at a music game, to my understanding, and hopefully they'll be getting better by the time Guitar Hero 3 comes out.

1099
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is Harmonix's third game

1100
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:38,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero was, so they already knew what they were doing a lot.

1101
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:57,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I don't know if anybody's heard, but there is a 2DX gold machine in Arizona right now as of probably about a month and a half ago, and it's at Mesa Golf Land, Sunsplash, and the one-player turntable right now, though, is broke or stolen or something, as I know.

1102
01:10:57,559 --> 01:10:58,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have never guessed.

1103
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:00,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1104
01:11:00,929 --> 01:11:03,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Mesa Golf Land is just like Roseville Golf Land.

1105
01:11:03,512 --> 01:11:07,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's huge, and it has, like, the water park, if I remember right, and everything, so.

1106
01:11:08,096 --> 01:11:08,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1107
01:11:08,616 --> 01:11:08,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1108
01:11:10,098 --> 01:11:12,560
[SPEAKER_06]: And they might be getting a poppin' music machine.

1109
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,160
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be cool.

1110
01:11:13,221 --> 01:11:13,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Poppin' music's awesome.

1111
01:11:13,961 --> 01:11:15,142
[SPEAKER_06]: They just said might.

1112
01:11:16,303 --> 01:11:17,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping they will, though.

1113
01:11:17,424 --> 01:11:18,345
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that's really all.

1114
01:11:18,385 --> 01:11:19,466
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1115
01:11:19,786 --> 01:11:21,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thanks so much for the call.

1116
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:22,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate it, Paradox Vincent.

1117
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:23,330
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a great week, okay?

1118
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:24,531
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1119
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:25,071
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, too.

1120
01:11:25,091 --> 01:11:25,452
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1121
01:11:25,492 --> 01:11:25,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Later.

1122
01:11:26,673 --> 01:11:27,013
[SPEAKER_11]: See you later.

1123
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:30,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Have lots of fun playing the 2DX Gold Machine, that's for sure.

1124
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:34,611
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's funny, though, is I think the PD game worked in reverse for me, because I forgot about, you know, KFC.

1125
01:11:34,651 --> 01:11:38,032
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they kind of fell off my radar as far as food options.

1126
01:11:38,072 --> 01:11:40,673
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, you know, hey, KFC sounds kind of good right now.

1127
01:11:40,693 --> 01:11:42,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I was sort of thinking about getting fried chicken on the way home.

1128
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:43,414
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys.

1129
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:46,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a southern girl.

1130
01:11:46,114 --> 01:11:47,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up on fried chicken and grits.

1131
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:50,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's one thing I do love about KFC.

1132
01:11:50,312 --> 01:11:51,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Biscuits.

1133
01:11:51,953 --> 01:11:52,873
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no.

1134
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:54,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of them have A&Ws attached to them.

1135
01:11:54,534 --> 01:11:54,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Biscuits.

1136
01:11:55,034 --> 01:11:57,895
[SPEAKER_11]: An A&W root beer is the bomb when it comes out of the tap.

1137
01:11:58,195 --> 01:11:58,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Biscuits.

1138
01:11:59,036 --> 01:11:59,856
[SPEAKER_09]: There was one time.

1139
01:11:59,876 --> 01:12:00,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Biscuits and honey.

1140
01:12:00,756 --> 01:12:01,497
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, biscuits.

1141
01:12:01,537 --> 01:12:01,897
[SPEAKER_11]: We get it.

1142
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,678
[SPEAKER_09]: There was one time I passed it up, and I really wanted to do it.

1143
01:12:04,898 --> 01:12:08,339
[SPEAKER_09]: They were selling root beer in gallon jugs, like the milk jugs.

1144
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:08,960
[SPEAKER_05]: They were.

1145
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that.

1146
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,201
