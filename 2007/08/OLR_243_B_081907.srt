Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,660
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,940
19th, 2007, for part B of episode number 243 of our podcast.

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,500
Yes, we've been doing this a little while.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,380
Of course on our show, if you're brand new to our program, we like to discuss the latest

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,780
in video games and gaming culture and, you know, we're three gamers that all met playing

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,760
DDR at an arcade and we've known each other for about five years doing this program and

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,760
just kind of like to give our share.

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,340
And of course it's all about what you guys have to say as well and you can always interact

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,400
with our program through the chat room or through our Skype line or, you know, our voicemail

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
or mailbag.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,260
You can always send us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com because if we can do

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,220
a show, if any old idiots like us can do a show, then you guys should be able to be a

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,440
part of it as well.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,260
So anyhow, let's get back into the gaming news.

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,300
Started off with some talk about Mario Kart coming out on the Wii.

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,460
There's some brand new details about Mario Kart on the Wii.

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,220
Apparently a couple of screenshots, new screenshots actually hit the internet this week and so

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,780
it gives some more details about what's going on.

24
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,300
Of course the tracks appear to be bigger and better as you would expect on a new console.

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,000
You can do jumps, little jumps again.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,260
The jump button is back.

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,940
Twelve player racing online, shortcuts within the tracks as well, mid-air stunts apparently

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,020
can be done in the game as well, and tracks being carried over from Mario Kart Double

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,440
Dash which is cool because some of the classic tracks of course have awesome design in them.

30
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,100
So I'd like to see the old school Rainbow Road come back one more time because I wasn't

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,540
as big of a fan of the new school Rainbow Road since the old one.

32
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,620
Mario Kart 64 I think was probably one of the best.

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,620
I love Mario Kart 64.

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,780
That's one of the few Nintendo 64 games I really, really adore which by the way I forgot

35
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,020
to say in part A during my gaming week, I played F-Zero 64.

36
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,020
I didn't care for it.

37
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,860
I know Jamie you said you loved that one.

38
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,860
I didn't really care for it.

39
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,900
I do see though now where a lot of like GX, the GameCube one came from because it totally

40
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,720
feels like an earlier version of F-Zero GX but I thought Mario Kart 64 was a way better

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,180
racer on the Nintendo 64 than F-Zero sadly.

42
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,620
Which makes me sad because I love my F-Zero but oh well.

43
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,180
Anyhow, anyways some interesting news in the homebrew scene on the Wii.

44
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,700
Apparently if you have a mod chipped Wii, they have just enabled it to be able to play

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,540
DVDs as if you really need to do that but in case you're interested, what you can do

46
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,860
is actually using a I guess clone CD like some special boot CD that you create.

47
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:57,940
You'll boot it with your Wii that's got, I guess it's a mod that's programmed in YO Assembly

48
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,940
1.8 and I guess they use this program called Wii Boss and then what you do is you just

49
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,820
mount the disc and pop in the DVD.

50
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:13,420
So you get to play it using the Wii Remote of course as the remote for it.

51
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,220
I don't know, it's kind of gimmicky, kind of cool.

52
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,140
Definitely something that they can implement later on since it looks like the Wii is fully

53
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,540
capable of course playing DVD movies.

54
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,020
There has to be some sort of functionality already built in that they're going to release

55
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,100
something for later.

56
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,960
Seems so weird how Nintendo does that.

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,460
They love to do these time release things on their consoles.

58
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,740
Like you know DS, surprise it goes online, surprise it has voice chat, surprise.

59
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,740
It's just interesting.

60
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,900
Nintendo has some very interesting strategies sometimes.

61
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,260
Well I think that as a company they're very far seen.

62
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,020
They look at the big picture, they have a vision and stick to it.

63
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:59,740
Well there was speculation on this article by Gizmodo, they were saying that possibly

64
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,740
later on since the whole issue was DVD licensing fees, I guess the license, the technology

65
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:11,060
to play back DVD video, obviously they didn't want to increase the cost of the Wii so which

66
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,940
you could possibly do later on is get a DVD channel for your Wii downloaded off of Wiiware

67
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,620
and then you pay the money for the licensing fee up front, there you go, pop that in and

68
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,620
you can play DVDs.

69
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,620
Well AZHP brings up an interesting point in our chat room.

70
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,900
There can't be anything already in the Wii that can play DVDs because they need to buy

71
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,340
the licensing to include that software.

72
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,140
It's not legal for them to add in DVD compatibility and time release it.

73
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,940
Interesting.

74
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,460
The son and dad said the Dreamcast was going to have DVD playback but it never happened.

75
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:51,020
I still don't think there's any problem because really the DVD, the audio and video, really

76
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,380
that's just a particular file and if the Wii is already set up to read those types of files

77
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,380
then having specific DVD playability in the Wii is not the issue.

78
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,100
It was not made with that intent.

79
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,940
It would just be able to read those files already.

80
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,220
It needs the software, I think.

81
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,060
RossDielUT says what a thinly veiled attempt to justify pirate mod chips since hey it plays

82
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,060
DVDs.

83
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,340
Oh and by the way you can play copied games.

84
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Interesting thought.

85
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,980
Nintendo's always, well this whole thing that surprised me about modding the Wii and about

86
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,620
their import policy with it is that they never I guess really cared that much in the past

87
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,620
given that in every other system except the GameCube it was all a physical lockout.

88
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,940
At least with the TurboGrafx it was a difference in the pin sets on the HuCards.

89
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,800
There was no real good converter.

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,940
I have the one that was supposed to be the best.

91
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,940
It doesn't work.

92
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,540
Except with the CD games there was no country coding but there were still new CD games but

93
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,580
I don't see exactly why they're as all up in arms on this when Sony's like hey you

94
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,780
can play them here.

95
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:13,580
It's kind of an old debate at this point for me but you know I think everything should

96
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,580
be region free.

97
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,600
I don't understand the intent to region lock things especially I mean I can understand

98
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,840
because the DVD licensing you have to region lock things but with the Wii if you don't

99
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,820
have DVD playback you don't need to region lock things.

100
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,020
I don't think you have to region lock everything with DVDs and stuff.

101
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,020
Look at the...

102
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,020
Unless it's porn.

103
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:35,660
PlayStation 3, granted it's Blu-ray but that's region free, the PSP is region free, DS is

104
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,020
region free, Game Boy Advance is region free.

105
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,420
I don't see what the point is.

106
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,660
If anything you're going to be selling more copies of games because people are going to

107
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,300
buy like say Oh and Done and then buy Elite Beat Agents.

108
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,300
Hey you sold an extra copy in Japan.

109
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,640
Who cares if they paid money to have it shipped over here.

110
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,200
That's their money.

111
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,340
But you sold an extra copy because of that.

112
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,060
Is that really a bad thing?

113
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,300
And then we're going to get a Ninja Pass but that's another story.

114
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,460
Jay that says Nintendo is a toy company.

115
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,180
They produce toys not DVD players.

116
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,680
GS68 says because if you buy the Japanese version of a game that has a North American

117
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,420
version it could cause problems with your region's market.

118
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,420
Interesting.

119
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:24,340
All right well if you want to chat with us join our chat room chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com

120
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,340
and give us your two cents.

121
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:34,540
Well for anybody who is you know still keeping up with anything about the Virtual Console

122
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,060
and the Wii I do have the update for the UK.

123
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,820
As you were saying previously Wave Race 64 is out for a thousand points.

124
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,540
It translated to seven pounds, ten euro.

125
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,660
And well it's Wave Race which I didn't really care for.

126
00:07:52,660 --> 00:08:01,780
We also have Crater Maze from the Turbo Graphics 16, 600 Wii points, 420 pounds, six euro.

127
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,200
And I think that's it.

128
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,900
Some new additions for you folks that like to play the Virtual Console in the UK and

129
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,020
of course we know here in America we get Super Metroid on Monday.

130
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,020
Not sure what else we get with that.

131
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,460
Crater Maze is a weird game.

132
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,080
There's a lot of weird Turbo Graphics games available on the Wii now and Genesis games

133
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,240
as well.

134
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,860
And some weird games coming out for the Playstation 2 very soon.

135
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,620
A brand new accessory is coming out for the Playstation 2 and In2Games is supposed to be

136
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,500
revealing this at the games convention in Leipzig.

137
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,940
It's a Wiimote basically for the Playstation 2.

138
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,140
I probably shouldn't call it that.

139
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,600
It's a motion sensing pad for the Playstation 2.

140
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,180
The games that are going to be coming out for it, Real Play Tennis, Real Play Pool,

141
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,180
Real Play Golf, Real Play Racing, Real Play Bowling, and Real Play Puzzle Spear.

142
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,540
Hmm, I've heard of some of these games before.

143
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,800
The little sensing pad is supposed to emulate tennis rackets, pool cues, golf clubs and

144
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,500
steering wheels amongst others.

145
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,900
Hmm.

146
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,340
I heard a voice of disagreement over there, Loki.

147
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,620
What do you think?

148
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
It's gimmicky shit.

149
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,260
That's what it is.

150
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,120
I've seen the pictures of them and it's not what you think.

151
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,580
It's not a game pad per se.

152
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,000
It's not like the Wii Remote.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,100
It actually is something that looks like a tennis racket.

154
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,420
Something that looks like a golf club.

155
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Something that looks like a bowling ball.

156
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,860
And it just has motion sensors in those.

157
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:30,300
So think, if you will, there was a golf game that came out called, I want to say, Real

158
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,660
Motion Golf or something like that on Playstation 2 and Xbox a while back.

159
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,220
And I don't know.

160
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,980
It's gimmicky shit.

161
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,060
Well, on the other hand, I can't help but feel like I've played these games before.

162
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,340
And when games start feeling unoriginal, I don't know about you guys, but I get a little

163
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,340
bit angsty.

164
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,340
Do you guys get a little bit angsty?

165
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,340
All the time.

166
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,180
That means it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

167
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:09,220
Jamie, why don't you start us off?

168
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:16,060
FU to headaches that develop into nosebleeds.

169
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,060
That's no fun.

170
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,060
No, it's not.

171
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,180
Is that it?

172
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,220
And also an FU to nosebleeds while I'm busy drinking.

173
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,220
Loki.

174
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,740
FU to pompous little jerks that think they can drive their truck around like it's a fucking

175
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,940
race car.

176
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,940
Actually this is funny.

177
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,700
We saw this last night when we were at the movie theater, this dumb ass blowing through

178
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,720
tons of stop signs in the parking lot, driving like 50 miles an hour.

179
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,020
And you know, usually it's like, where the fuck are the cops when you need them?

180
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,340
There just happened to be a cop right when you needed him.

181
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,980
Pulled the bastard over.

182
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,020
It was awesome.

183
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,460
I laughed my ass off.

184
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,460
Good times.

185
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,620
Justice is served.

186
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,380
My FU goes to this weird cavity thing I have in my mouth.

187
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,020
It's not like a tooth cavity, but I think like one of my crowns is coming off or something

188
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,740
and now it's like a cavity and it sucks because it hurts and now I have to go to the dentist

189
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,820
and I hate going to the dentist because I, oh God, the dentist makes you feel so stupid.

190
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,100
I don't know about you guys, but I hate my dentist.

191
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,580
So I hate every single one.

192
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,900
I think it's only been like one dentist I've ever gone to that I ever liked.

193
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,900
He should go to my dentist.

194
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
He's very great.

195
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,900
He probably doesn't take my insurance.

196
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,740
FU to my dentist insurance, not letting me go to very many dentists, but I always fall

197
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,740
asleep.

198
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,740
Let's see.

199
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,740
Just FU to the dentist in general.

200
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,460
Not my favorite thing to do.

201
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,460
Okay.

202
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,460
Just kind of following up with the story here.

203
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,060
I know this is really bad radio, but this is what they are.

204
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:47,700
Those are the controllers for those crappy attachments that they came out with for the

205
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
Wii.

206
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
That's the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

207
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
Except they're not.

208
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,260
They just have like little sensors and shit on them.

209
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,500
So yeah, it's not a whole lot to get excited about, but hey, I mean if you're into that

210
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,460
kind of stuff and you don't want to go out and buy an actual Wii system and you want

211
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,900
to be able to bowl at home and stuff, great.

212
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,900
Buy the game.

213
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,480
It's only like 30 bucks anyway.

214
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,080
So it's not really a Wiimote coming to the PlayStation 2, but it's these Wii-like technologies

215
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,660
coming to the PlayStation 2.

216
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,460
Something like that, yeah.

217
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:25,940
Now what's also interesting, this kind of leaked out during an online demo for, I believe

218
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:31,420
it was for another game, during Unreal Tournament 3, they had accidentally paused the game or

219
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:37,060
something and a gamer card screen popped up that's going to be tied in with home.

220
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,400
And apparently, you know, the PlayStation Network will be getting a similar type of

221
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:51,480
thing with their home service and my guess is going to be very similar to what Xbox has

222
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,220
right now with their live service.

223
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,100
What's interesting though is, you know, gamer card might sound familiar seeing as there's

224
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:09,300
that whole my gamer card thing as part of Xbox, so, I don't know, great.

225
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,860
Well, I mean, if it's not broken, why fix it?

226
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,220
It's not the most original idea, but it's good that they're getting something else,

227
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
I guess.

228
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,060
Joe, she's 16, says, Sony innovating again.

229
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,060
Brilliant.

230
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
Innovation.

231
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,060
Yeah, that's the key word.

232
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,060
All right.

233
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,860
Well, if you guys want to comment on this, we're actually going to open our Skype line

234
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,020
a little bit early tonight.

235
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,900
If you weren't listening to part A, unfortunately, the live stream is getting shut off at 8 p.m.

236
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,940
or so we're being told for some maintenance.

237
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,140
So to make sure that our live listeners get a chance to interact with us tonight before

238
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,580
the plug is pulled on the live stream and we have to finish the show with no live interaction,

239
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,760
we want to open up our Skype line.

240
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:56,340
So please head on over and give us a call, 1-866-GAME-OLR, I'm sorry, it's 1-866 or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

241
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,340
Get it right, Rob.

242
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:04,860
Go ahead after this amount of time, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio

243
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,380
on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

244
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,460
So just waiting for a call to come in and we'll take it.

245
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,380
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

246
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,380
Who's this?

247
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,380
Ravenstaufen.

248
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,380
How are you tonight, Sky?

249
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,380
Hi.

250
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,380
Fine.

251
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,380
What's up, Ravenstaufen?

252
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,380
What's on your mind?

253
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,380
Bioshock is on my mind.

254
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,900
God, you've got the quickest dialing finger in the world.

255
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,400
You're always the first one to get through.

256
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
It's amazing.

257
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
I do.

258
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,460
I know how to work Skype.

259
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,940
I think it's the new version of Skype or something because it shuts everyone else out once one

260
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,500
person's coming through.

261
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,180
I wish I could go back to the old version.

262
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,900
Anyway, what's on your mind?

263
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Bioshock.

264
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:44,540
Yeah, but I want to ask you that the mini-game, the hacking mini-game, are you good at that

265
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,540
game?

266
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,620
Rob, you said you didn't do it, didn't you?

267
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,980
I wasn't able to complete it, but I only tried it one time.

268
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
It's Pipe Dream.

269
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,260
I think that's what it was, Pipe Dream, or that game on PopCap Games with the little

270
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,260
Chinese fireworks.

271
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,580
I don't remember the name of that game, but it reminded me of both those games.

272
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,700
Yeah, it's real easy.

273
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,420
Here's my trick in the whole thing.

274
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,220
You just flip over all the tiles if you can.

275
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,620
Dude, that's my trick.

276
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,980
Yeah, connect them.

277
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,660
Why wouldn't you want to flip over all the tiles?

278
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
I don't know.

279
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
Is there a downside to flipping over?

280
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,660
You pay money.

281
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,660
Not that I found out.

282
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,660
You pay money?

283
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,780
Yeah, you know, it's either hacking or pay money.

284
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,780
Oh.

285
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
Oh, well, no.

286
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,100
When you're flipping over the tiles, you don't pay money.

287
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
No, no, no.

288
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,060
If you lose, then your health goes bad.

289
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,500
You can pay money to just have it automatically hack, or you can do the tile thing, but yeah,

290
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,100
I don't understand why you wouldn't flip over all the tiles.

291
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,260
Yeah, because some people I talk to go like, the game's hard.

292
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,260
This is really hard.

293
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,980
You're supposed to flip over every tile and try to figure out shit.

294
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,020
That seems to kind of defeat the purpose if you just go in there and flip over every tile.

295
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,700
There are some other tiles, though, that are in the actual game.

296
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,020
I'm not sure why, if there's a downside to flipping over tiles.

297
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,260
Maybe that's one of the differences where the demo and the real game are a little different.

298
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,460
I'll have to ask someone I know that already owns the game.

299
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,980
Well, what did you want to say about the hacking, Raven's Dolphin?

300
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,220
Well, you know, yesterday I showed how I can be very good at the hacking.

301
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,260
I showed everyone that I can get it done quite quickly, and they went like, oh, it's very

302
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,260
hard.

303
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,820
I went like, it's not hard, and I showed them that it's not hard.

304
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,380
And what did they do, were they calling you names because you just flipped over every

305
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,380
tile?

306
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,380
That was your trick, or what?

307
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,260
No, they just went like, I can never get through the hacking, like the little mini-game.

308
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,020
I'm like, I'm going to show you how to get through it.

309
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,980
Well, I believe in the full version of the game you're supposed to be able to hack the

310
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
vending machines.

311
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,540
There's other stuff you can hack, too.

312
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,740
Yeah, there's other things that hack in the game.

313
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,740
Can't wait for it, though.

314
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,340
Yeah, are you excited about Bioshock?

315
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,780
Yeah, but the thing about, there's an interesting story about this game for me.

316
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,540
I can't remember pre-ordering it at all.

317
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,100
And EB says I have a pre-order for it, so someone must like me.

318
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,140
You think somebody went in there and put a pre-order down for you?

319
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,140
I don't know.

320
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,020
I just can't remember for the life of me why I have a pre-order for it.

321
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,940
All right, well, one more thing, Rayman's Dolphin?

322
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,300
Yeah, there was one more thing.

323
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,980
When you, this is about Bioshock, when you first saw Rapture, would your jaw on the floor,

324
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,180
like that can't be right?

325
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,660
Like when you first go down into the city of, the city?

326
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,820
Yeah, when you see the crab and then you see the beautiful city, did your jaw just go,

327
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,980
oh my god?

328
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
Kind of.

329
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,260
I was already, like, just in that very first scene where you're in the ocean with all the

330
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,180
fire everywhere, kind of like how Loki said at the beginning of the show, like some people

331
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,540
just turn around and look at the fire for them.

332
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,700
It'll make a good movie.

333
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,740
That was more, that's what I was thinking, is that, like, it's totally set up like a

334
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
movie.

335
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,980
That's what gets, that is what has a lot of people really sucked into this game, is they've

336
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,500
really pulled it off, making it just like a movie, and 2K to some extent did this with

337
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,380
their last game, Prey, which I actually talked about on this program a lot, and it was actually

338
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,980
a first person shooter I really liked, was Prey, because it was set up for dummies like

339
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,980
me.

340
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,980
You could never die in Prey.

341
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,260
I loved it.

342
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,020
For the hardcore FPS fan, they hated it, but it was also set up very much like a movie,

343
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,960
but I don't know, Bioshock pulls it off in a different way that's much more engrossing

344
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,860
than even Prey.

345
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,860
One last thing.

346
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
Of course.

347
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,860
Next gen flushing.

348
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,980
I enjoyed flushing the toilet and see it actually going down.

349
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,140
Which way did it spin?

350
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,140
Which way did it flush?

351
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,140
Dr. Clockwise.

352
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,140
Oh.

353
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,820
That's a good question, because it is the bottom of the ocean, so the question, because

354
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,780
this city is supposed to exist at the bottom of the ocean, so the question is, does it

355
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,780
spin a different way?

356
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,780
But what part of the world was it in?

357
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,780
I don't know.

358
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,820
I complained, I said that, you know, now we have next gen flushing, and this is next generation.

359
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
Flushing and water.

360
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,260
You could flush the toilet in Duke Nukem 3D.

361
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,620
You could flush the toilets in Final Fantasy VI.

362
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,340
But not like this.

363
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,780
You can't just go up to it and just flush it.

364
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,940
If you go in the bathroom in the palace, you can kneel on the toilet.

365
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,780
I guess that's the problem.

366
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,140
And you move off of it and it flushes.

367
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,140
Really?

368
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,060
So do all the boys sit when they pee?

369
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,940
It's everybody kneels on the toilet.

370
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,380
But you can also flush them in Animal Crossing too if you sit on them like a child.

371
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,820
You guys are very bored.

372
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,420
You know, I have to say, that certainly lets you know that the creators of the game have

373
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,740
gotten it down to every last freaking detail when the toilet flushes and everything.

374
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,500
The fact that you can run around and eat all the food and smoke all the cigarettes, and

375
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,860
apparently you can also play the guitars in the game.

376
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,660
Holy Shonen in chat says, LOL, the ideal of next gen flushing toilets.

377
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,260
Gold Banjo says, OMG, how far technology has taken us.

378
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,460
It's exciting.

379
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,620
I'm feeling very confident about future gaming.

380
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,200
I was just shocked as well.

381
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Just flushing that toilet.

382
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Like, this is it.

383
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
This is next gen.

384
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
All right.

385
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,060
Well, we're going to let you go for the future so you can go get your copy of Bioshock and

386
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,060
flush all the toilets.

387
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,060
Okay.

388
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060
All right.

389
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,060
Bye.

390
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,060
Have a good one.

391
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,060
Bye.

392
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,060
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,060
Next gen has not started until I can take a splicer and give them a swirly in the toilet.

394
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,060
New call.

395
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,060
Hi.

396
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,060
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

397
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,060
Who's this?

398
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,060
Hi.

399
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,500
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

400
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Who's this?

401
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
Hi.

402
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,500
It's ADHP.

403
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Hello.

404
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
There you are.

405
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
What's on your mind, buddy?

406
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:06,340
Oh, well, I remember last show when you guys said that you didn't think Take-Two or Rockstar

407
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,340
was doing that badly because they're the makers of Grand Theft Auto.

408
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
Yeah.

409
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,340
Yeah.

410
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,820
Actually, they've been doing a lot of restructuring because they have really bad money management

411
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,300
because of the whole hot coffee incident.

412
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,440
They poured millions of dollars down that.

413
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,940
They're actually way down.

414
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,900
Yeah, and especially the fact that they don't really have anything new coming out this year

415
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,780
now also kind of has to hurt them a little bit.

416
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,540
Yeah, definitely.

417
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,820
So yeah.

418
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,340
Is that all you want to comment on or is there other stuff tonight?

419
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,980
Well, I don't know.

420
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:44,860
I didn't really get into the feed until after part B and part B wasn't that long.

421
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,860
Oh, all right.

422
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,420
Well, I know because we have to make sure we get the Skype in before eight o'clock tonight,

423
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,220
but our podcast will still have everything in it, all the stories and everything.

424
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,060
Well, what games have you been playing this week?

425
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,460
I've been playing a lot of Half-Life 2, actually.

426
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
Yeah.

427
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,740
Because I just got a new computer and I got this headset just so I could Skype in and

428
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,740
call you guys.

429
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,740
Awesome.

430
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,740
Cool.

431
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Thank you.

432
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,740
Yeah.

433
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,940
So wait, you brought a brand new computer, so is it like a top of the line or is it like

434
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,420
a Costco computer or what?

435
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,500
It's kind of a budget computer.

436
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,260
It's like a Dell 600 bucks.

437
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,380
I was like, eh, I want something that plays games, but I don't want something that will

438
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
kill my wallet.

439
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,780
So you probably won't be playing Bioshock on it.

440
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,980
Ah, man, I wish I could.

441
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,340
Do you have a 360?

442
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,420
No, I just have a Wii for now.

443
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:35,980
I'm not getting into the next gen until they fix the stability issues on the Xbox 360.

444
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,020
You know, actually, Ross Steele kind of brings up a follow-up point in the chat room.

445
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,540
Ross Steele, UT, says, as far as take two, because 2K is a part of that, and says they

446
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,460
almost have nothing other than GTA, Bioshock might be their first post-GTA hit.

447
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,700
So maybe they do have a game this year that's going to bring in the money.

448
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,300
I thought it was 2K that was doing Bioshock.

449
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,260
It is 2K that's doing Bioshock, but don't they all roll up in take two?

450
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,780
Take two owns 2K, and they also own Rockstar.

451
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,660
Yeah, so it's just different subsidiaries of take two.

452
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,660
I see.

453
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
Interesting.

454
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,540
Yeah, I just wanted to, like, every time a great game comes out for the Xbox 360, I'm

455
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,020
like, man, I wish I had an Xbox 360.

456
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,640
And then I get, you know, hear stories of like, oh man, my Xbox 360 broke just before

457
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
this game came out.

458
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
What am I going to do?

459
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,340
And I'm like, I don't want to get that anymore.

460
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,580
Well, at least they have the warranty thing, so it's, you know, a little better now.

461
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,180
All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

462
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,700
No, that's about it.

463
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,700
All right.

464
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,260
Well, thank you so much for calling, and have a good week, okay?

465
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,260
Yeah, you too.

466
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Thanks.

467
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,260
Have fun with the new computer.

468
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,260
All right, bye.

469
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
Bye-bye.

470
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,420
I wonder if he'll be playing World of Warcraft on that computer, because there's a lot of

471
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,180
people who go out and get those budget computers to play World of Warcraft.

472
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,180
We'll see.

473
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
We'll take a couple more calls.

474
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,100
If you'd like to give us a call again, the number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

475
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,900
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

476
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,140
But don't call now, because we have another call on the line right now.

477
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

478
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,420
Hey, guys, what's up?

479
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
It's Footy Monster.

480
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
Hello, Footy Monster.

481
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
What's on your mind?

482
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
Nothing much.

483
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,220
I actually want to share with you guys something that I learned during the past day, which

484
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,900
is the Hannah Montana game for the DS actually seems to be really good.

485
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,900
What is this?

486
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,380
Hannah Montana, you know, that Disney show?

487
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,620
Wait, wait, wait.

488
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,220
Hannah Montana for the DS is good?

489
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,220
Yes.

490
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,220
This is newsworthy.

491
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,780
It's a platform that's out already, but the one is going to come out soon.

492
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,340
Now, how do you know this?

493
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:32,860
Because I checked the video that was posted on DS Fanboy on Friday, and basically the

494
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:38,220
game is like jam sessions for the DS, where you have the guitar, you can strum it and

495
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,900
play chords and stuff, but takes you to the next level where you can not only strum, but

496
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:48,100
also pick individual strings, and also you get a full drum kit in which you can actually

497
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,940
play like everything on the drum, and a bass guitar, and also you have connectivity with

498
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,740
other DSs, and you can play on Wi-Fi.

499
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,220
Each person takes an instrument, you can jam together, actually.

500
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,620
The chat room is all surprised that you're serious.

501
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,980
I'm serious, completely serious.

502
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:08,100
It looks like Rock Band meets jam sessions with a really bad IP sticking on the front.

503
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
I see.

504
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,460
So Hannah Montana is a music game that looks to be really good, basically.

505
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,460
Yeah, yeah.

506
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,460
It's a music game, yeah.

507
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,540
So it's not good because I don't get to punch her in the face or anything.

508
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,540
That's not what makes it good, right?

509
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
Yeah, nothing helps.

510
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,540
It's actually a good game.

511
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,540
Wow.

512
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,180
It seems to be a good game.

513
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:29,780
I actually called to Bobby Blackpool's show before, and he said that he thinks, or that

514
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:35,220
he heard, that they might re-release without the IP, like the Hannah Montana IP slapping

515
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,140
to it, like the developers.

516
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,500
That would be hilarious if they did that.

517
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,140
Can you guys think of any other games that were like that, that were actually pretty

518
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,260
good games that just had a crappy brand on it?

519
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,540
I'm trying to think if there's anything else.

520
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,820
I'm like, surely there was something else in gaming history.

521
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,820
Maybe the chat room can think of something like, was there a great concept for a game

522
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,580
or a great game that just got totally screwed by the IP that was attached to it?

523
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,580
Cool Spot.

524
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,820
Oh, Spot, the video game?

525
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,820
Yeah, Cool Spot.

526
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,220
Oh, like all the way back in the NES days?

527
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,220
Super NES.

528
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,860
Oh, I don't remember that one.

529
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,660
I remember the old board game one that was kind of like Othello.

530
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,260
Well, no, this is with the Spot from 7-Up.

531
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,060
There were the Noid games.

532
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,060
The Noid games?

533
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,060
Was any good?

534
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
You annoyed yourself.

535
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,460
They were a good waste of time.

536
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,460
Oh!

537
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
Vectorman.

538
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,460
Sneak King.

539
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
Hello.

540
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,460
We did have one recently.

541
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,460
But actually, I don't know.

542
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,460
The Burger King IP kind of made it, actually.

543
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,460
I don't know.

544
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,460
I wouldn't say that was a bad IP.

545
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,460
But, huh.

546
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,580
And now I'm just curious about if High School Musical 2, the game, is going to be coming

547
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,580
out any soon.

548
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,580
I still have Shane's CD.

549
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,940
Well, High School Musical, the game, just came out in DS last week, and it's coming

550
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,220
out, the karaoke games coming out on Playstation 2 and Wii in November.

551
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,580
All I have to do is go to Disneyland and then run away from them while they chase me.

552
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,500
So Footy Monster, I'm just shocked.

553
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,660
A very unlikely recommendation for Hannah Montana, but you know what?

554
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,740
I guess this will truly put people to the test.

555
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,140
Is a good game a good game a good game no matter what?

556
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,300
And if you remember, though, they do have that special Disney, like Xbox Live-type service

557
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,900
that's starting with the Hannah Montana 2 game, too.

558
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,980
I just posted the link to the story and the video in chat, so just check it out for yourselves.

559
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,380
I mean, really, it's like I can tell you Hannah Montana seems to be a good game and

560
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,340
you're probably going to laugh at me, but once you see that, I actually look at people's

561
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,380
reaction in the chat room before and it's like, I can't believe that he's right.

562
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,180
It looks to be pretty cool.

563
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,820
The fact that you can actually jam, like, if it was Rock Band, it's like people said

564
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,060
it's jam sessions for the DS mixed with Rock Band with a crap IP.

565
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,380
And how the fuck did Hannah Montana get her name on this?

566
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,380
That's what I want to know.

567
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,740
I'm looking at this right now, so wait, I'm going to play this little video here just

568
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
because I can.

569
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,100
And this is coming from DS Fanboy.

570
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
So where's this video?

571
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,900
Oh, it's going to stream a lot here.

572
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,060
Let me take a little bit.

573
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,780
It's not going to be good.

574
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,460
It's kind of stupid, like, I don't know why the person doesn't really show the game screen

575
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
that much.

576
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,460
They show the guy talking.

577
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,460
Yeah, I know.

578
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,900
I just want to see the screen, but they show the screen a couple of times and you can get

579
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,180
the feel of the game.

580
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:22,460
You can record up to two minutes, even if you're playing Wi-Fi, so you can actually

581
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:28,020
record two minutes of something if you're recording with your buddies and that kind

582
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,020
of thing.

583
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:35,020
So it seems to be pretty feature complete, which is kind of impressive.

584
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,740
Son of Dad says the license kills this game.

585
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,500
No hardcore gamer will buy this.

586
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,100
I will buy it.

587
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
You dare to defy.

588
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
What son of Dad?

589
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,460
Well, here's the best part, though.

590
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:54,180
If it's a game like this where it's not going to be that popular, it means it'll just be

591
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,060
in a bargain bin pretty quick and then you can pick it up.

592
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,780
But it might be popular because of the fact that, oh, he's like strumming the little guitar

593
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,780
with the DS thing.

594
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,660
You have actual strings and you can either pick the whole thing or just each string in

595
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,060
itself and use the feedback-selected ports.

596
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,060
Very interesting.

597
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,220
Talk about gaming gems in the strangest places.

598
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,660
I mean, wow, there's little drums, too.

599
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,660
That is something else.

600
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,420
I might have to check that out.

601
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,340
Real quickly before we let you go, I know you also co-host a podcast about strictly

602
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,480
role-playing games, right?

603
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
That is correct.

604
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,980
Am I allowed to plug it?

605
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,980
Yes, you may plug it.

606
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,500
All right, The Ultimate Quest, you can find it on UltimateQuest.net and the next show

607
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,740
is probably going to be released in the next few days, so yeah, there you go.

608
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,460
Well, what I want to ask you about Ultimate Quest, I know Blue Dragon is coming out very

609
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
soon.

610
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
Are you excited about this?

611
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,620
Because it's been getting some mixed reception from people.

612
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,140
I would be excited about it if it wasn't for two reasons.

613
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:58,420
First off, one of the other co-hosts on the show, Jack Ransom, Shadow Slayer, better known,

614
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:04,580
he actually played the demo and also did Xenocore, and they both agree that it's really nice

615
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,420
looking, it's something that 360 doesn't really have any access, which is like a traditional

616
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:13,660
RPG, but that's it.

617
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:18,140
So that the whole thing that they look really like little kids will put off any hardcore

618
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,260
360 game and things that don't have a 360, so whatever.

619
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,260
All right, we'll see.

620
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,540
All right, anyway, we've had John for a long time, so we got to let you go, but thanks

621
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,660
so much for the call and for the tip on Hannah Montana, who would have known?

622
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,660
Yeah, no worries.

623
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,380
I got to spread the Montana love with this whole thing.

624
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,380
Take care.

625
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,380
Have a good flight.

626
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,380
I understand you have a 14-hour flight tomorrow, so have a good flight.

627
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,380
All right.

628
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
Thanks a lot, man.

629
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,380
All right.

630
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,380
Bye-bye.

631
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,380
See you.

632
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,380
See you.

633
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,380
See you.

634
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,380
He's breaking up a little bit there at the end, too, so it's probably for the best.

635
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,380
We'll take one more call.

636
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,380
One more call.

637
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,380
Why not?

638
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,900
If anybody else decides to call in, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number, or our username on Skype

639
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,260
is OrangeLoungeRadio.

640
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
Waiting for it.

641
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,700
Oh, give it a second because of the buffer.

642
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,140
I'm trying to see what else is going on in chat here.

643
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,140
Let's see.

644
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:07,620
Joshi16 says he's pimping Montana out on the streets.

645
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,780
Footy is back in chat saying that game will rock everybody's socks.

646
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Looks interesting, though.

647
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:20,100
They've got some good screenshots on IGN or something, and it's got a little too much

648
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,460
sparkles and pink for my taste, but I don't know.

649
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,260
I like that idea, though, that maybe the developers will release the game without the Hannah Montana

650
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,180
IP, like it's a different game.

651
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,380
Hitstun says you could say the GBA Astro Boy was brought down a little by its license.

652
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,380
The original Astro Boy is hard to watch.

653
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,700
I'm talking about IPs.

654
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,580
All right, well, unfortunately, there's no other calls coming on the Skype line for right

655
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,020
now, so we're going to go back to the news, and just so you know, the live listeners,

656
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,580
Live 365 may dump the show at any time.

657
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,980
Unfortunately, it will be inevitable.

658
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,380
We'll just have to keep going, but we're going to keep recording tonight's show, and

659
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,420
of course, you'll be able to hear the full thing and anything you might miss because

660
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,140
of the Live 365 dump tonight, you can certainly hear it on our podcast, which you can download,

661
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,420
of course, at orangelandtraded.com.

662
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,260
We would have done the mailbag segment right now, but unfortunately, we didn't get a whole

663
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:10,680
lot of emails, but if you do want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelandtraded.com.

664
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,900
If you wanted to maybe call in tonight and get the chance to, you could always send us

665
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,340
an email, and Dark Soccer always reads through the emails.

666
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,740
But not this week.

667
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,080
Yes, and let us know what you think about Hannah Montana, the game, especially because

668
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,160
I know there's a lot of music gaming fans that listen to this program because of our

669
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,840
history that we did, obviously, a lot with music games in the past.

670
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,300
This is a very interesting, I think a lot of people have said in the past, DDR is starting

671
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,880
to look more and more like a game for little girls.

672
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,180
This doesn't help the music gaming genre break out of that stereotype.

673
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:46,780
Alright, well let's get back into some gaming news and talk about, we were talking a lot

674
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:51,380
before we went to Skype about how Sony is kind of getting all these ideas from other

675
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,380
places.

676
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,740
At least it seems like, it feels like, and this story certainly doesn't help.

677
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,740
You remember Afrika?

678
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,740
Afrika!

679
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,740
Afrika!

680
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,740
Afrika!

681
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,460
The game we saw at E3, what, a couple of years ago, that everybody looked at it going, what

682
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,460
the fuck is that?

683
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,380
Well, we still don't know what the fuck that is.

684
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,540
Is it Jamba Safari?

685
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,820
If so, that's fucking rad.

686
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,380
I'm gonna harpoon me and Gazelle.

687
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,700
But apparently the developer said you do not get to attack the animals in Afrika.

688
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,700
Aww.

689
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,940
Otherwise they have said nothing about the game, but there are rumors, again I must stress

690
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:26,220
rumors because I think this sounds like a load of crap, but the rumor is going out saying

691
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:34,980
that Sony is supposedly going to be releasing a Wii Fit type touch pad to go with Afrika

692
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,820
to make the Safari experience complete.

693
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,900
Now my question is, how in the fuck does that work?

694
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,260
Do you stand on it and then it just like shakes?

695
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,260
It's rhinoceros approach?

696
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,340
That makes no sense to me whatsoever.

697
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,860
That's why I think this was totally pulled out of somebody's butt.

698
00:32:53,860 --> 00:33:00,900
The other thing too that's also suggesting that Afrika is going to be out in like January.

699
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,340
So I don't think so, since we haven't heard anything about it.

700
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,020
And it's Afrika, I mean.

701
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,540
Well, could they delay it to maybe add something in?

702
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,540
I mean, who knows?

703
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,500
Well, it wouldn't be out before the Wii Fit then, now would it?

704
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
Alright.

705
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,940
Just kind of always an interesting story, but I do take it with a huge grain of salt.

706
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,940
Yeah.

707
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,060
Something else that's interesting, part of EA's plan to totally dominate everything that

708
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:33,060
exists in the world, they are now partnering up with Hasbro to release games based on their

709
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:39,340
favorite properties, including Monopoly, Risk, and Scrabble, as well as toys including G.I.

710
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,580
Joe, Tonka, Nerf, and Littlest Pet Shop.

711
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,100
They're still doing Littlest Pet Shop?

712
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,260
I didn't even realize there was a Littlest Pet Shop.

713
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,260
Yay?

714
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:56,340
I don't know, Nerf would be kind of neat, like a first person shooter or Nerf game.

715
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,420
I think they actually have had that before.

716
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,220
I'd put that in a category of good for them.

717
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,700
I wonder if this means Monopoly on Xbox Live Arcade, because that's what we really need.

718
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,700
Not in Scrabble.

719
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,820
No, because then people will never stop playing, because a Monopoly game on average takes about

720
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,820
six hours.

721
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,820
Awesome.

722
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,100
Well, at least you can't have someone cheat as the banker.

723
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,100
True.

724
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:29,700
Speaking of online games, though, Park Associates, who is big for running those studies on online

725
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:38,580
activities, said that there are 34% of adult users on the internet playing games, as compared

726
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:44,780
to 29% on YouTube, and 19% on MySpace and Facebook.

727
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:51,620
So they have shown a 79% growth in online gaming over the year, and only 46% in social

728
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,480
networking.

729
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,140
So we likes our games.

730
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
Keep them going.

731
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:02,960
On top of that, though, I've noticed a lot of online games have that social aspect already

732
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
combined with it.

733
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,660
I'll tell you, half the reason I used to play Ragnarok online was on an internet game, but

734
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:14,700
half the reason I used to play that or some of the web-based ones, like I did Gaia for

735
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:19,500
a little bit, was just to chat with people.

736
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,380
I totally believe that casual games are as big as sometimes the hardcore gamers forget

737
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,680
to admit, because again, I use the example of walking around in the workplace and looking

738
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:37,020
at little cubicles, and so many people playing those freaking PopCap games, like Collapse

739
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,140
and what have you.

740
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,380
It's an incredible business.

741
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,140
They're not supposed to be doing that at work.

742
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,380
Well, they do.

743
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,780
They can do it on their breaks.

744
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,140
Wink, wink.

745
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,340
Not on our breaks at my work.

746
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,340
Aw, that's too bad.

747
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
We get stabbed in the head.

748
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
Really?

749
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
Yeah, really.

750
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,340
That sucks.

751
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
It's an HR issue.

752
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
All right.

753
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,420
Anyway, well, this might be a future HR issue if you're caught playing this game at work.

754
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,840
It's Super Chick Sisters.

755
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,420
You might have heard of this game this week.

756
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,820
It's from PETA.

757
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,540
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released this game called Super Chick Sisters

758
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,260
as part of their website, KentuckyFriedCruelty.com.

759
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,180
I played the game, and you know what?

760
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,620
I got to tell you, it's not bad.

761
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,540
For a little homebrew cook-up title, it's not bad, and it's very tongue-in-cheek.

762
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,980
It's obvious that the people who made the game know a little something about video games,

763
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,500
because basically, here it is.

764
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,780
The premise of the video game, it's kind of like a Mario Brothers rip-off, but instead

765
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:34,540
of Mario Brothers, you have a little chicken named Nugget.

766
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,540
Which made me laugh.

767
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,420
And then I think Chickadee, I think was the other one.

768
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,420
No, Chick and Nugget.

769
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
Was it?

770
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
I don't know.

771
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,420
Well, whatever.

772
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,460
So you have these two things, and I guess Mario and Luigi could not rescue Pamela Anderson,

773
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:52,040
who's dressed as Princess Toadstool or whatever.

774
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,440
She has been kidnapped by the evil Colonel, and Mario and Luigi are suffering from a case

775
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,380
of Wii-itis, they've been playing too much Nintendo Wii, so their hands are broken.

776
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:07,300
So they can't go rescue, so they have to rely on Chick and Nugget.

777
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,420
So you go through these Mario-type levels, instead of collecting coins, you collect these

778
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,580
little birds, and then they give you little facts about like, did you play it?

779
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:21,060
I did play it, and I wish more of my Mario Brothers games would have that, hey, did you

780
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:26,180
know that they chop the piece off of chickens and don't even do anything?

781
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,140
And did you realize that they boil them alive?

782
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,140
That's so horrible.

783
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:34,420
Did you know that they put chickens in the incinerator and boil them?

784
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,780
I mean, I was just like, this is amazing.

785
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,900
I mean, I'm kind of like- Parking news, KFC tortures chickens.

786
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,780
Part of me wants to invite PETA on this show, even though they are such a controversial

787
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:50,460
organization, but part of me goes like, why did you do this?

788
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,020
Why did you make a game out of this?

789
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,860
You do realize there are copyright laws out there?

790
00:37:54,860 --> 00:38:03,140
I mean, there's like, they weren't at all trying to say, oh yeah, it's Larry and Barry

791
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:07,900
or something, but it's Mario and Luigi, and they have Toad in there, and they use the

792
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,740
Wii, and they're not afraid about that.

793
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:14,300
In fact, at one point, Mario gets beat up for being cruel to turtles.

794
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:19,140
Oh my god, you played the level three to get that message, I know.

795
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,780
Yeah, level three was Mario gets beat up by the people for ethical treatment of turtles,

796
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,780
or something like that.

797
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:30,740
I mean, it's very tongue-in-cheek, but it's funny, and it's, you know, whether you agree

798
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:36,220
or disagree with PETA, it's kind of an interesting way to get their message across, because my

799
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,940
thing, and the thing I would want to ask PETA, and I swear I'm going to send him an email

800
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:45,020
this week and try to get him on the show, I want to know is, why did they choose to

801
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,320
make a game out of this to get their message?

802
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,100
Is it because they want to get to that stereotype World of Warcraft player who's doing an all-night

803
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,860
raid with a bucket of wings in his lap?

804
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,860
I mean, are they trying to get those guys to think twice?

805
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,860
The game made me hungry.

806
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,860
What is...

807
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:04,660
I've got a $5 gift certificate to KFC, and I'm thinking about using me to get me some

808
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,660
chicken to stop.

809
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,660
Oh, stop.

810
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,020
Even if you read all about the torturous ways of hate.

811
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,340
This is kind of funny.

812
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,100
I'm kind of digging this game.

813
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
It's interesting, isn't it?

814
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,100
I dig already.

815
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:19,340
All right, so, yeah, DarkTetsuya in chat says, Nintendo will sue.

816
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:22,460
Frisbee says, this makes me want KFC even more.

817
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:28,300
Joshi16 says, but if it's for a good cause, they don't have to care about laws and restrictions.

818
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,540
Just look at gross anti-smoking commercials.

819
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,940
But my question is, you know, PETA is a very controversial organization.

820
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,100
There's a lot of anti-PETA sentiment out there.

821
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,300
They may not want their...

822
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,740
Especially, I don't think they gave...

823
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,140
Obviously, they did not give them permission for this stuff.

824
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,520
It's sort of like, what's the business...

825
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,140
Is it Walmart that doesn't allow anybody out front of their store?

826
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,140
No, it's Target.

827
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,460
Target does not allow anybody out front of their store, no matter who they are.

828
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,900
I mean, it could be Girl Scouts or anything.

829
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,140
They do not allow anybody out front of their store.

830
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,460
It's just to be consistent policy.

831
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:59,340
You know, they don't want their name tied to any, you know, Republican, Democrat initiative

832
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,980
or whatever it is.

833
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,380
So I think it's Target.

834
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,620
I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but, you know...

835
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,460
I sure as hell know it's not Walmart.

836
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,260
Maybe Nintendo wants to be like that where they don't want to be tied to any organization,

837
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,700
and I somehow doubt they were asked about this.

838
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:20,080
So, WonderDogHerald says, PETA, as usual, likes to appeal to children for their tactics.

839
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,940
People eating tasty animals.

840
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,940
Alright.

841
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,940
Anyways.

842
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,100
If you guys keep saying stuff like that, they're not going to want to come on the show.

843
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,100
I gotta...

844
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,100
I like chicken!

845
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,100
I want to get peed on the show.

846
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,100
Freshly decapitated.

847
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,140
I didn't get the whole pipe level.

848
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,260
That frustrated me, and I turned it off.

849
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,260
Yeah, level 3 was...

850
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,620
I stopped at level 3, too.

851
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,020
It was too hard to figure out.

852
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,020
A little over the top.

853
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,900
Someone needs some better level design.

854
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,820
Again, for a homebrew game, which essentially is, it's not bad.

855
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,820
I mean, it's obvious a lot of effort went into this.

856
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,620
It wasn't... that's what surprised me most about it, is that it wasn't cheaply put together.

857
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,620
That was what I think makes this newsworthy.

858
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,360
It wasn't some dumb, crappy little Flash game.

859
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,220
They actually put a little effort into this, and that's what made it...

860
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:04,440
The kernel, the spider robot, and someone put in a news article that the kernel wears

861
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,820
a Bowser mask at the end of the game as the spider robot.

862
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,820
So I didn't get that far, but I don't know.

863
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,820
Interesting.

864
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:19,100
Ubisoft is now talking about a brand new top secret game that they have in development.

865
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,380
That's going to be focusing on user-generated content.

866
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,340
I guess you could kind of compare it to LittleBigPlanet or something of that sort.

867
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:30,460
Anyways, it will allow gamers to support their creations across platforms, sending out pie

868
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:35,580
in the sky meters, or it was apparently according to Joyce, it gets sending their pie in the

869
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,380
sky meters off the charts.

870
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,500
But I don't know, great, I think a lot more companies are going to start kind of taking

871
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,460
this stance and allowing more user-created content instead of banning that.

872
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:53,540
I mean, look at Forza 2 with the whole creating cars, Halo 3 with the new videos that they're

873
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,540
uploading.

874
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,540
Hell, even before that with Burnout.

875
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,380
Revenge where you can upload your gameplay footage and stuff.

876
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,180
Sing Star where you're going to be able to do the same thing.

877
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:07,460
So something that we're probably going to see more of.

878
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:14,820
All right, well, Dark Soccer likes to surf the internet up and down every single week

879
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:18,220
and choose a website of her liking to share with all of you.

880
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,680
And we call it her website of the week, and I'm curious what Dark Soccer has picked out

881
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,220
for the kids this week.

882
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:32,020
Let's play the music and see.

883
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:37,780
The website of the week is PETAKillsAnimals.com.

884
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,780
What Rob?

885
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,500
Oh boy, there went our chances of getting PETA on the show.

886
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,500
All right.

887
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:50,820
It's basically, actually their most recent news were about the recent PETA trial in North

888
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,100
Carolina for animal cruelty.

889
00:42:53,100 --> 00:43:01,260
Basically they had to submit the numbers of the amount of animals that they had actually

890
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,420
killed involved in their research.

891
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:08,180
They have on their, I actually, I remember some of this from being on Penn & Tiller's

892
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,180
Bullshit recently.

893
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,380
It was a great show by the way.

894
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:25,020
Where one of the charges on their inventories was for a walk-in freezer that cost $9,370.

895
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,480
So now I'm going to bring up that show because they actually went and did the size of one

896
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,480
of them.

897
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,220
So we're talking about for a walk-in freezer that would cost that much, it would be twice

898
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:39,620
the size of the room that we're in right now, a bedroom, seeing how much meat you would

899
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,180
store in a walk-in freezer.

900
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,940
What about vegetables?

901
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,940
Well, no.

902
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,940
Vegetables need refrigeration.

903
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,820
That's a lot of frozen peas.

904
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:52,520
But there was, there's just quite a bit on here about, you know, exactly what they spelled.

905
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,240
The head of PETA is actually on, you know how they say, oh, well don't use this medication

906
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,020
because it was tested on animals?

907
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:07,580
The head of PETA is actually on insulin that was, the research was done on animal testing

908
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,180
and derived from animal products.

909
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,620
I just thought it was very interesting.

910
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:18,460
There's pretty much a company run by hypocrites, but it will.

911
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,660
Well I guess we always have to have a counterpoint, every point made on the show, so there you

912
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,660
have it.

913
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:28,680
All right, anyhow, let's talk a little bit about Squeenix.

914
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,780
We love Squeenix and they are opening their brand new store online on August 20th and

915
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,100
they even have a time, 6 p.m. Pacific time.

916
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,140
There's going to be a brand new online shop opening up and it's supposed to have Squeenix

917
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:48,860
collectibles, model kits, and clothing accessories, and I wonder if that means buttons or if you'll

918
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,900
be able to buy a full cosplay on the website, that would be pretty awesome.

919
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,040
Probably some of those Final Fantasy XII action figures like the Balthier one which I have

920
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,780
in, because Balthier is very awesome in Final Fantasy XII.

921
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,060
So if you're a Squeenix fan, I'm sure you're going to be hitting up their website on August

922
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,540
20th, 2007.

923
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,420
Unfortunately I don't recall exactly where the website is located, but I'm sure if you

924
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:15,640
go to Squeenix's website at Squeenix.com, there'll be a link right there when the store

925
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
opens.

926
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,780
So be on the lookout for it.

927
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:26,000
Well if in case you're wondering what those large hard drives are for on the PlayStation

928
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,740
3, well wonder no more.

929
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:36,540
Actually they are going to be releasing a digital tuner for recording TV and it's supposed

930
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,760
to be unveiled at Lipzig here pretty soon.

931
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:48,420
So this has been confirmed by 3Speech, their semi-official blog for Sony.

932
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:59,780
All right, well in other news, they are talking about the chip manufacturers that are behind

933
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,860
the Wii shortage.

934
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,580
Nintendo wants to up production from what I'm understanding, but they are not able to

935
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:10,300
get the chips they need still.

936
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,900
The ones who are making the components are saying that if it keeps up like that, they're

937
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,540
not going to be able to keep up with the demand.

938
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,180
Hmm, I'm not surprised.

939
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:31,140
All right, well talking about Electronic Arts for a minute, going on over to Macintosh gaming,

940
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,540
you know Mac sometimes gets a bad rap because they don't really have a lot of games on it,

941
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:39,620
but you might have heard early in the year EA is supposed to be kind of helping out a

942
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,980
little bit more.

943
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,220
And EA has actually shipped four games for the Macintosh.

944
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:50,060
They've shipped Battlefield 2142, Need for Speed Carbon, Harry Potter and the Order of

945
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,360
the Phoenix, and Command and Conquer 3, Tiberium Wars.

946
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,200
So for those of you saying there are no games available on the Mac, well there's four pretty

947
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,860
big titles right there, especially Command and Conquer 3, a lot of people love their

948
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,940
Command and Conquer.

949
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,940
So there you have it.

950
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,320
In fact, I got a message earlier this week online asking if I played Command and Conquer

951
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,980
and if I wanted to play and I said no, you'd have to ask the Loki because I don't really

952
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,980
play that.

953
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,980
No, no, Command and Conquer 3.

954
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,980
So there you have it.

955
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:10,980
I didn't play it though.

956
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,980
Anyways, let's see.

957
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:22,220
I was going to say there's been some interesting stuff going on in the whole EA Wikipedia article

958
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,220
there.

959
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:28,700
Apparently some EA staffers have been changing a little bit of history on there, removing

960
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:34,940
key facts about their company, some stuff that they may not be too proud of, and it's

961
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,940
been pretty interesting.

962
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:44,380
They've actually traced back the IP address used to make those changes back to EA.

963
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:54,340
And I guess they've been responsible for one-third of the changes made on there of the 1351 changes.

964
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,660
Those are from EA.

965
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:00,940
And of course, many of those though have been reversed by the Wikipedia community.

966
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:08,180
EA did come out and say they've actually, they sometimes update websites with info about

967
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,220
company games and employees.

968
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,780
For example, EA has sent a correction to Yahoo Finance when they had misspelled the name

969
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,000
of an EA executive.

970
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,420
Many companies routinely post updates on websites like Wikipedia to ensure accuracy of their

971
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,220
own corporate information.

972
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:30,380
However, I think deleting information that is negative about your company's past is not

973
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:34,300
exactly following that.

974
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,300
It's basically just...

975
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,300
That's poor ethics.

976
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,620
Yeah, it's hiding the bad spots.

977
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,460
Like Wikipedia doesn't allow you to edit an article that's up about yourself, right?

978
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,780
Yeah, in fact that is a major violation.

979
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,720
Like for instance, I don't touch the OLR article.

980
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,140
There is an Orange Orange Radio article on Wikipedia, how it survived this long against

981
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,140
their notability rules, I have no idea, but hey, it's there.

982
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,900
Probably because I guess since we were lucky enough to have the news articles, then there's

983
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,060
been other sources about us, but whatever.

984
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:06,700
I've never touched the article, although I'm always fascinated reading the updates and

985
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,020
the work that other people have put into it.

986
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:13,180
But I just won't touch it because I'm like, well that's kind of weird.

987
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:17,100
Like there's things I want to go fix in it, like some of the shows that aren't on anymore.

988
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,020
I fixed grammatical errors.

989
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,020
Did you?

990
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,020
I guess I have.

991
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,020
I guess that's different.

992
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,740
Grammatical errors is one thing, but I don't touch it because, I don't know, it's weird.

993
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,700
Some folks in chat are saying, you're welcome.

994
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,700
You're welcome.

995
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,340
Joshi16 says, Wikipedia is becoming corporate propaganda machine.

996
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,340
Interesting.

997
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,780
Interesting perspective.

998
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,420
You know, that's not the only Wikipedia thing I read about this week.

999
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,660
I heard that the, was it the ESA supposedly was going onto Wikipedia and had edited some

1000
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,500
articles on like abandonware and stuff too, and they were deleting things.

1001
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,140
Like there's some IPs traced back.

1002
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,900
I want to say I read something about that somewhere.

1003
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,780
I think I remember that too, yeah.

1004
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,700
So kind of interesting, all this Wikipedia information that's come out this week.

1005
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,700
I think ours needs a bit of an update.

1006
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,700
I was just looking at it.

1007
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,780
Yeah, it probably needs a small update, but I don't want to do it myself.

1008
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,460
So maybe a kind listener will go in there and clean it up.

1009
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,460
We'll see.

1010
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,820
Anyways, let's see.

1011
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:15,520
Well, actually, I had a little bit of news in regards to stuff coming out on the Virtual

1012
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,860
Console and the PSP.

1013
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,580
There is actually a Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.

1014
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,300
It has actually been rated for a Wii release.

1015
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,300
And LucasArts is bringing out Indiana Jones to the PSP, tentatively titled as Indiana

1016
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,220
Jones 2008, but it's not Lego.

1017
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:39,580
Dude, I wonder if it's based on the old Indiana Jones arcade game.

1018
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:40,580
That game was pretty awesome.

1019
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,580
That would be rad.

1020
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,900
Well, they did have, was it that Indiana Jones game that was being worked on by LucasArts,

1021
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,660
the one that was supposed to be all, you know.

1022
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,900
That was the Indiana Jones 2008.

1023
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,460
Yeah, but still this could be something like that, or maybe tying in with the new Indiana

1024
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,460
Jones movie.

1025
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,460
Maybe.

1026
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,460
I don't know.

1027
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,300
Harrison Ford is too old.

1028
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,300
He's never too old.

1029
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,300
They'll make him a robot.

1030
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,700
Well, I guess if Bruce Willis can do it, Harrison Ford can.

1031
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:11,860
Alright, well, one more story for you guys before we get into some last minute stories

1032
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:12,860
tonight.

1033
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:18,100
Dementium, The War, is a brand new game coming out for the DS, and I think what kind of sets

1034
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:22,480
this apart from most other games is it's kind of like, I guess you could call it like Silent

1035
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:30,980
Hilly, scary, bloody, gross, rated mature for the DS, and it's coming out on Halloween.

1036
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:37,140
October 31st is the release date for this game, Dementium, and it's, I guess it's actually

1037
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:45,500
based off an independent title by Renegade Kid, and Dementium is a mature rated game,

1038
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:50,900
and it looks like it's going to be kind of like, you know, that type Silent Hill horror

1039
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,900
type game.

1040
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,620
I was actually thinking of the Call of Cthulhu game.

1041
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:59,420
Well, remember they have that one with a touch to the dead a while back that was also a mature

1042
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:04,500
rated title that was more of a shooter, but I think around the same side, Insecticides

1043
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,580
was supposed to be coming out on the DS as well, so that one was pretty cool.

1044
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:12,940
That was that adventure game that was kind of film noir, but with insects.

1045
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:17,020
We don't see a lot of survival horror on the DS nonetheless, so kind of interesting.

1046
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,020
It looks good.

1047
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:23,220
I haven't seen too much on this game, but I'm always interested in more survival horror

1048
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,380
games, because they always succeed in scaring the pants off of me.

1049
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,120
So there you have it.

1050
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,260
Let's go around and see if there's any last minute stories here in studio.

1051
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,940
We would have done the Skype line right now, but of course since we're afraid, I guess

1052
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,220
the live listeners are still connected.

1053
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:39,700
It's 805, and the maintenance was supposed to happen at 8 o'clock, but we're still on

1054
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,700
air, so.

1055
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,700
Breaking news.

1056
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,700
We're still here.

1057
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,700
I guess so.

1058
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,300
We're going to try and keep going until they turn off the lights on us, so let's go around

1059
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,060
and get any last minute stories, then we'll open up the Skype line a little longer until

1060
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,060
we get booted.

1061
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,420
I don't know if any more calls will come in, but we'll see.

1062
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,420
Okay.

1063
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,420
I've got some last minute stories.

1064
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:02,620
Ninja Gaiden 2 is going to be debuting on the Xbox 360, and with PlayStation 3 coming

1065
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,600
later on, it's supposed to debut at Tokyo Game Show.

1066
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:12,360
That is the rumor coming from GameSpot Korea, so it'll be interesting to check that out.

1067
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:19,540
Let's see here, Halo 3 of course nearing completion, almost gold right now, and there's been some

1068
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:25,060
interesting details on this new Bungie Pro program that's going to be happening, and

1069
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:32,420
basically what Bungie Pro is, is it's going to be a, anyone that has a copy of Halo 3

1070
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:38,020
and a gold subscription will be allocated six slots, or 25 megabytes of space to upload

1071
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,040
gameplay videos and whatnot.

1072
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:47,480
Now if you decide to purchase Bungie Pro, what you'll get is 250 megabytes across 24

1073
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,820
slots and it'll be worth 750 points, which is going to be good for one year, so that's

1074
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:53,820
kind of interesting.

1075
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:59,180
If you're really into your gameplay shots, then that might be something to look forward

1076
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,180
to.

1077
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:05,420
Another thing, according to V Jump, there's a scan of some new Hudson Soft games called

1078
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:10,820
Deca Sporta, and it looks kind of like Wii Sports a little bit, they've got, it looks

1079
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:19,940
like Go Kart Racing, they actually have Archery, and it looks like Tennis of course, and Basketball,

1080
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:24,100
so that's kind of cool, oh and Volleyball.

1081
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:30,860
Let's see what else here, Halo the movie has been apparently reconfirmed that it's coming

1082
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,060
and is apparently already filming in New Zealand.

1083
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:40,980
Bullshit, yeah that's what I'm thinking too, this is coming from XboxFamily.com, so I don't

1084
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,540
believe it, but we'll see, that it?

1085
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,700
There's one other thing, I heard some interesting stuff this week, a game I did not realize

1086
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:57,540
was coming out this fall, apparently, was it Kingdom of Fire, Circle of Doom is supposed

1087
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:02,300
to be coming out in early December, I thought that was coming out in 2008.

1088
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,860
Speaking of upcoming games, what have you heard about Two Worlds, anything?

1089
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:11,180
It's just like Oblivion, but with online multiplayer as well, you can play quests online with people

1090
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:12,180
to co-op.

1091
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,040
I've been curious about that game, very curious, and of course it's coming out the same week

1092
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,300
as Bioshock, so it's going to be a tough week, but I actually was very curious about that

1093
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,060
game, thinking about picking it up, but I wish there was a demo online or something

1094
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,060
like that.

1095
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:26,780
Well let me go this way, apparently it's supposed to be pretty cool, and they've gone to great

1096
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:32,280
details in it, in fact they've actually motion captured bunnies that are in the game, rad!

1097
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,260
And the day and night cycles are supposed to be pretty cool, and I don't know, it's

1098
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:42,340
kind of like Oblivion, but it's all third person, and I don't really know much beyond

1099
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,340
that.

1100
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:47,540
It looks cool, but I think unfortunately it's coming out the same week as Bioshock.

1101
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,580
It would have been a different audience.

1102
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,740
It originally was supposed to come out last week, which would have been perfect, because

1103
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:55,740
it's Madden and that, and that would have been a pretty good game to pick up if you're

1104
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,740
not into Madden.

1105
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:59,500
Well, but a lot of people aren't into first person shooters either, like I said at the

1106
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:04,300
top of the show, I may think Bioshock is amazing, but I still kind of am first person shooters.

1107
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,340
Maybe you can buy Bioshock, I'll buy Two Worlds and we can trade off later, that would be

1108
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,340
fun.

1109
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,340
I'll see.

1110
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,340
Alright.

1111
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,580
Jamie, do you have any last minute stories tonight?

1112
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,540
I'm actually looking at old games right now.

1113
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,960
Looking at old school stuff?

1114
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,960
Star Parodia.

1115
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,740
Any particular reason?

1116
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:20,860
Because someone mentioned Star Soldier, and I was like no no no no no no, you need to

1117
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,860
play Star Parodia.

1118
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:26,700
Only game where you can play as a flying PC Engine, the Vic Viper, or Bomberman in the

1119
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,700
same game.

1120
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,300
Alright, well I have some very quick last minute news for you guys.

1121
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:36,140
Footy Monster was sending me a link, apparently the Bioshock PC demo is coming out tomorrow

1122
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:39,940
at 7 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, that would be 4 o'clock Pacific.

1123
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:46,380
So the Bioshock PC demo is coming out, this is according to a post from the 2K Games forum,

1124
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:48,500
so it is probably legit.

1125
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,460
You can of course download it at most of the usual suspect sites, but something to think

1126
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,180
about, you probably want to make sure you have the latest drivers for your video card

1127
00:56:55,180 --> 00:57:00,580
before you download that big old game, otherwise you might be sorry.

1128
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,360
Maybe I'll get Bioshock for the PC over the 360, who knows, but then again I want achievement

1129
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,360
points because of achievement points.

1130
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,580
I don't think it's going to run that well on PC, at least not on our PC.

1131
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,620
Probably not on my PC, that's true.

1132
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:16,260
One other thing to speak about here, Nintendo Power has apparently given Metroid Prime 3

1133
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,140
a 10 out of 10.

1134
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:19,660
Wow, really?

1135
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:23,420
A Nintendo Run magazine giving their game a 10 out of 10?

1136
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,420
That's so surprising.

1137
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:30,180
Hold on, because something that the story notes is that you may or may not remember,

1138
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,040
but Ocarina of Time only got a 9.5 from Nintendo Power, so the fact they gave this a 10 out

1139
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,140
of 10 does make your eyebrow raise a little bit.

1140
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:42,780
Oh wow, okay, so a 9.5, because that's really different than a 10.

1141
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:47,380
It's almost perfect, but Metroid, that's perfect.

1142
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:51,140
Really do you think they would have to sell more of Ocarina of Time?

1143
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:57,900
I think that game sells itself, whereas Metroid Prime maybe needs a little help to be selling

1144
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,220
some of those units.

1145
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,220
Yeah, I know.

1146
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:05,460
I don't know if it's especially newsworthy because it is a Nintendo magazine, but I will

1147
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:10,220
be very impressed if it starts getting more perfect reviews from other places.

1148
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,940
Even the official Xbox magazine sometimes rags on some of the releases.

1149
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,100
I want to say I read some review.

1150
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:20,100
I think they gave Track and Field a 3 on the Xbox Live Arcade, which I don't know.

1151
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:25,420
For some people it might have been too high of a score, and a lot of folks are giving

1152
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:27,460
Bioshock, of course, very high scores.

1153
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:32,260
Joshi16 in chat is pointing out that Bioshock got a 10 out of 10 from the original Xbox

1154
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,700
magazine, but is that really a shock?

1155
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,700
Is it?

1156
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,700
Who knows?

1157
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:40,860
Nintendo Maniac 64 says Ocarina of Time's negative 0.5 was from Navi.

1158
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:46,380
Listen, listen, listen, goddammit, listen!

1159
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:50,060
All right, well, that pretty much does it for all the stories tonight.

1160
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,900
I don't really think we have anything else.

1161
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,260
I opened up the Skype line and told the chat they could call in.

1162
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:59,220
I'll give one more shout if you guys want to get through 1-877, because I guess they're

1163
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:07,020
still live and still going, 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1164
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,980
Call!

1165
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:10,320
We'll see.

1166
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,320
If not...

1167
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,320
Ah, there we go.

1168
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,140
We're getting some calls now.

1169
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,140
Just takes a little bit.

1170
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,740
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1171
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:18,740
Legend of Zaku.

1172
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,740
Oh, see, because you missed the first wave.

1173
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,100
What's on your mind, Zaku?

1174
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,220
Nah, I just came back from 8 on the break.

1175
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,220
How was that?

1176
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:30,260
Just had a little 2DX tournament today, managed to be some chumps and, you know, distorted.

1177
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:34,220
But yeah, Champions of the Coast wasn't so bad this weekend.

1178
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:37,060
You're always going to some tournament on the East Coast, it seems like.

1179
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,660
Actually, it's my first 2DX tournament.

1180
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,060
Wow, well, how was the 2DX tournament set up?

1181
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,060
Was it fun?

1182
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,500
Yeah, it was pretty good.

1183
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:49,020
I mean, there were, you know, we didn't have to qualify since there were not, you know,

1184
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:53,700
not that many people to actually, I mean, there was a lot of people, but not enough

1185
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:59,100
to actually warrant one, so it was just random seating, but yeah, it was just having to go

1186
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:04,100
through people and just playing on, you know, from particular sides.

1187
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,160
I didn't know you were much of a BeatMania 2DX player.

1188
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:13,620
Of course, man, but yeah, I've also, but if there's anything that would make that whole

1189
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,060
weekend is just seeing a 2DX freestyle.

1190
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:18,060
A 2DX freestyle?

1191
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,060
Yes.

1192
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,060
How did that work?

1193
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:26,180
The break is the only place we can freestyle any machine, any of their music or dancing

1194
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,180
machines.

1195
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,060
Well, who did that and what did they do?

1196
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:36,740
They did Tangerine Streams, some sort of, you know, homoerotic stuff, no offense, but

1197
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:42,140
there were two guys just like, you know, one with the long hair, just petting them while

1198
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:47,220
they were hitting the keys, you know, petting his hair and pressing it up.

1199
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,220
Interesting.

1200
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,220
Yeah, that's what I think.

1201
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:53,820
Okay, I'm going to challenge you this week.

1202
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:57,220
Tell me something in your gaming week that has nothing to do with music games.

1203
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,300
What other kinds of games do you play?

1204
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,300
I don't know.

1205
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:05,580
I'm just thinking about a 360, but since, you know, the failure rate's too high, I don't

1206
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:11,700
know if Bioshock or anything like, you know, Halo 3 Gears of War would just be, would just

1207
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,100
outweigh all the risks in just buying a 360 in the first place.

1208
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:19,980
Dude, you're the second caller tonight to tell us that the failure rate issues are making

1209
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,020
you contemplate the 360.

1210
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,020
That's making me nervous.

1211
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,020
It's interesting.

1212
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:30,620
And God forbid a PS3, and I know I don't want to pick the latter, so I don't really have

1213
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:34,340
that much of a choice right now.

1214
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:40,860
As a person who personally owns multiple Xbox 360 systems and has never had one crap out

1215
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:45,020
for heat issues, I don't know what the hell people are talking about.

1216
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:52,580
I mean seriously, okay, maybe your system, okay, maybe you may have, you know, the unlikely

1217
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:54,300
situation where your system craps out.

1218
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,300
Who gives a shit?

1219
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,300
You have a fucking three year warranty on the heat related issues.

1220
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,300
It gets replaced within a couple weeks.

1221
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,060
That's the issue.

1222
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,860
They're making me wait two, three weeks just to get, just to get a new one.

1223
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,860
Boo fucking who?

1224
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,860
That's what I have to fucking say about that.

1225
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:15,980
I don't, I don't get why Sony can make a PS3 that craps out, you know, at a blue moon,

1226
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:22,700
and 360s is like what, like four in ten consoles, like what, one in four consoles are breaking

1227
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:23,700
out?

1228
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,700
Come on.

1229
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,400
How do we know that their console won't crap out?

1230
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,140
There hasn't been enough games to play on it that have fucking actually done anything.

1231
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:34,140
I mean the reason why the systems crap out for the 360, I think a lot of people are putting

1232
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:38,220
these in their entertainment cabinets and they're just doing stupid shit with them.

1233
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:42,100
And okay, let's say for example that there is something wrong with, you know, the heat

1234
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,780
sink on the chip.

1235
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,700
All the new consoles now have the upgraded heat sinks on them.

1236
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:52,340
If you happen to get an older one by some magical, you know, mistake, they will fix

1237
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:56,500
it within a couple weeks and that will be the end of your problems altogether.

1238
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,820
Why waiting two weeks for something is a big deal.

1239
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,820
Okay, okay.

1240
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:03,000
But I don't want to be, I don't want to have those horror, I don't want to be, play out

1241
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,780
the horror stories of having to go through eight, ten consoles just to get it right.

1242
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:11,580
I mean it's just, it's just, it's retarded to just have to go through multiple consoles.

1243
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,140
You're not, hold on, shut up for a minute.

1244
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:16,060
I died, not used that good, but look.

1245
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:20,960
I did have an Xbox 360 that did crap out on me after four days and I was so fucking pissed

1246
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,960
when it happened.

1247
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,140
You remember on this program I was blah, blah, blah, don't you fucking buy a 360 because

1248
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,820
they'll fucking die on you, blah, blah, blah.

1249
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:29,440
I was so pissed when it happened, but I'm over it.

1250
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,220
I mean they were quick, they got, they got the job done.

1251
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,780
I mean it didn't take two or three weeks.

1252
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:35,780
I had it back that week.

1253
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,780
Did they pay for shipping?

1254
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,780
Did they pay for everything?

1255
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:44,020
Did they pay for shipping, you know, they sent me a box, they sent me a coffin to send

1256
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,020
it back in.

1257
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,420
I heard they don't do that anymore.

1258
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,420
I think they still do.

1259
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:50,300
That's the thing, then I have to incur charges when I should be.

1260
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,620
You're not going to incur any charges, then you're talking about like they're going to

1261
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,020
have to replace the system eight times.

1262
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:58,540
If that were the case, they wouldn't be selling millions of fucking consoles.

1263
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:01,380
This wouldn't be like a hot selling item.

1264
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,940
You already have that happening to certain people.

1265
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:08,140
Here's what the problem is, you hear fucking idiots on the god damn internet that bitch

1266
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:12,700
like fucking little babies about their fucking console breaking, and everyone's like, oh

1267
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,460
my god, all of them are breaking all at once.

1268
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,460
Don't give me that bullshit.

1269
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:17,460
I have a migraine now.

1270
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:18,460
All right.

1271
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:19,460
Okay.

1272
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:20,460
Hold on.

1273
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:25,340
Here's my other thought, though, is that what about that the new Xbox 360s have like the

1274
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,340
new chips in them or whatever?

1275
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,180
That's yet to be seen.

1276
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:35,380
I mean, if those are if those break out less, you know, like, you know, once in a blue moon

1277
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:40,780
or they're very, very rare, then I'll hop on it, you know, you know, at the top of the

1278
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:41,780
hat.

1279
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:42,780
I'll tell you what.

1280
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,780
I'll tell you what.

1281
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,980
Drew Nami in chat says, Loki, you need to fag your anger.

1282
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:46,980
I'll tell you what.

1283
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:47,980
Fine.

1284
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:48,980
You can go ahead and skip buying a 360.

1285
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:49,980
I'll enjoy playing Bioshock.

1286
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,700
You can go ahead and wait for the next big game to come out for the PlayStation.

1287
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,700
Oh, I'm sure I'll be next year sometime.

1288
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:57,980
I would say he could get it on PC, but he has a Mac, right?

1289
01:04:57,980 --> 01:05:02,740
I'm building a new PC anyway, so that's going to be happening a few days once I start ordering

1290
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:03,740
the parts.

1291
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:10,300
I've already set aside a good 15, 1600 for so it's come the PC can hold me for now.

1292
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:14,980
And then hopefully by Christmas, once we know whether the new heat sinks will actually make

1293
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:18,660
a difference, then I'll think about, well, the PC might hold you, but will it give it

1294
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:19,660
the reach around?

1295
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:20,660
Oh, no.

1296
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:23,580
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

1297
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:30,500
And on that note, look, Zaku, I appreciate the springer-fied call that this show got,

1298
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,020
but we appreciate the perspective.

1299
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,020
Yes.

1300
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,020
Sorry, Zaku.

1301
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,020
Time's up.

1302
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,020
Take care though.

1303
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:37,020
All right.

1304
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,020
Bye.

1305
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,020
Bye.

1306
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,020
I can have new calls?

1307
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:41,020
Seriously.

1308
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,020
Seriously.

1309
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,020
People talking about fucking heat sinks and issues with it.

1310
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:45,100
This is more than just Zaku though.

1311
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:49,340
This is your pent up anger at all the internet blogs and people across the entire internet

1312
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,580
that have made people like Zaku.

1313
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,180
I don't know what the fuck they want.

1314
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:56,540
I mean, they've already decided, they've already made revisions to fix this problem.

1315
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:58,740
They have a three-year fucking warranty on it.

1316
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:00,080
What the hell more do you want?

1317
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:05,620
I mean, if you're Sony PlayStation 3 craps out on you, good luck in it fixed.

1318
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,620
Maybe you could like do my dishes.

1319
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:07,620
I don't know.

1320
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,620
It'd be pretty awesome.

1321
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:09,620
I don't know.

1322
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,620
It's just, it's stupid.

1323
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:11,620
It really is.

1324
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:12,620
All right.

1325
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:13,620
Another call.

1326
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,620
One more call, then this is it.

1327
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,620
Hi.

1328
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:16,620
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1329
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:17,620
Who's this?

1330
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,620
Hello.

1331
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:19,620
It's Paradox Vincent.

1332
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,620
Hello, Paradox Vincent.

1333
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:21,620
What's on your mind?

1334
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:22,620
Hey.

1335
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,620
How are you?

1336
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:24,620
I'm good.

1337
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:25,620
How are you?

1338
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:26,620
Not bad.

1339
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:27,620
Not much.

1340
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:28,620
Just calling in after a while.

1341
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:32,740
I haven't been able to really listen to the show live, but finally got sat down and sit

1342
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:34,980
down and talk to you guys again.

1343
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,980
Yeah.

1344
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:36,980
Well, what's up?

1345
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:39,820
Was there a story tonight you wanted to comment on?

1346
01:06:39,820 --> 01:06:47,220
I did play the Kentucky Fried Cruelty Chicken Game, and it was pretty good.

1347
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:53,700
It's definitely better than a lot of charity organizations putting up web games on there.

1348
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,900
It was fun and stuff.

1349
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,660
It was certainly better than most politically oriented games, and even better than a lot

1350
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,740
of Homebrew, which, oh, I can't believe.

1351
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,940
I'm so sorry, Paradox Vincent.

1352
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,740
I've got to go on a tangent for a minute.

1353
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:10,980
Did you hear about the Homebrew that was on the DS that was like, avoid the gay mob or

1354
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:13,340
whatever it is?

1355
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:17,500
You control the little character, and then if you get hit by the mob, it goes, oh, you

1356
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,340
got hit by a gay person.

1357
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:20,340
Game over.

1358
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,340
It's huge.

1359
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:26,060
It's been hitting all these websites because it's like, oh my gosh, homophobia in the Homebrew

1360
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:27,260
scene.

1361
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:30,820
I just kind of read it going, well, there's idiots everywhere.

1362
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:35,540
The unfortunate thing is that when you give this guy attention, unfortunately, more people

1363
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:37,840
are going to seek this game out and play it.

1364
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:42,700
Not just people who like gay guys who want to play it and laugh at it for being stupid,

1365
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,380
which I admit I was tempted to do, but I didn't.

1366
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:48,500
But then you're also going to have people that inadvertently read about this through

1367
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:54,860
sites like MTV or whatever that report on it going, yeah, I do hate gays.

1368
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:58,580
I want to play this game, and I want to find this guy who made this game and help him make

1369
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,820
a better game.

1370
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:00,820
I don't know.

1371
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:04,680
I don't think we should give these kinds of things any attention whatsoever.

1372
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,460
So maybe I shouldn't have said anything about it at all, but I just thought the whole thing

1373
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:10,440
was very interesting, and the Homebrew was really bad.

1374
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,440
It's really bad.

1375
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,940
Anyway, sorry, Paradox.

1376
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,940
Really bad, Homebrew.

1377
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:14,940
Yes, really bad.

1378
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,740
So, okay, back to the PETA game.

1379
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:21,740
What do you think was their motivations for making it?

1380
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:29,020
You know, it's either what you said in trying to kind of target the video game playing audience

1381
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:38,740
and tell them, hey, Kentucky Fried Chicken is bad, or they could have just been seeking

1382
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:45,700
out a new media to get their message out, and then they noticed that web games are pretty

1383
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,700
popular.

1384
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:52,360
So then they just chose that route, which, I mean, there are certain things that I like

1385
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:58,940
to convey more through music and film that it's not necessarily targeting a specific

1386
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:07,940
audience but just kind of getting things views out there, so it could have just been that.

1387
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:19,460
What I'm also curious about, because it kind of got me thinking about it, is that if they

1388
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:24,100
chose to do this to connect with a gaming audience, it kind of worked, didn't it?

1389
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:28,280
Because all the major gaming blogs reported on it, and I probably would have never heard

1390
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,960
of this game had it not been posted, like all these different blogs are on the internet.

1391
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:35,580
So in a way, it kind of worked, and it kind of did get their message out there, huh?

1392
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,580
Here's the thing.

1393
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:42,020
It got the attention because it's on all these game blogs.

1394
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:45,300
You know they're going to get a cease and desist for this.

1395
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,140
That's going to be even more attention for them.

1396
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,140
Do you think?

1397
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,140
I don't think they will.

1398
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,140
I think they will.

1399
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:51,860
All right, we'll see.

1400
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:52,860
I wouldn't know.

1401
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:53,860
All right.

1402
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:57,780
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Paradox Vincent?

1403
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:01,740
Yes, two things, and I'll try to get them done real quick.

1404
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,140
Quick guitar hero, 80s review.

1405
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,140
Great song list.

1406
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:11,820
I love almost every song in there, and they gave me a couple new favorite songs, but they're

1407
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:19,660
just really kind of not great charts, especially the turning Japanese chart was really boring,

1408
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:25,740
but I guess it's Activision's first real take at a music game, to my understanding, and

1409
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:30,020
hopefully they'll be getting better by the time Guitar Hero 3 comes out.

1410
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:37,620
This is Harmonic's third game, Guitar Hero was, so they already knew what they were doing

1411
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:38,620
a lot.

1412
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:45,300
Also, I don't know if anybody's heard, but there is a 2DEX gold machine in Arizona right

1413
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:51,820
now as of probably about a month and a half ago, and it's at Mesa Golf Land, Sun Splash,

1414
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:57,340
and the one-player turntable right now, though, is broke or stolen or something as I know

1415
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:58,340
it.

1416
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:03,140
That I would have never have guessed, because Mesa Golf Land is just like Roseville Golf

1417
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,140
Land.

1418
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:10,180
It's huge and it has the water park, if I remember right, and everything.

1419
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:16,220
And they might be getting a popin' music machine, but they just said mics.

1420
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:19,020
I'm hoping they will, though, so that's really all.

1421
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:21,460
All right, well, thanks so much for the call.

1422
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:22,460
Appreciate it, Paradox Vincent.

1423
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,460
You have a great week, okay?

1424
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,460
All right, you guys too.

1425
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:25,460
All right, later.

1426
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:26,460
See ya.

1427
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:29,860
Have lots of fun playing the 2DEX gold machine, that's for sure.

1428
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:32,820
You know what's funny, though, is I think the PD game worked in reverse for me, because

1429
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:38,060
I forgot about, you know, KFC, you know, they kind of fell off my radar as far as food options.

1430
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:40,540
I'm like, you know, hey, KFC sounds kind of good right now.

1431
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,780
I was sort of thinking about getting fried chicken on the way home.

1432
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:43,780
You guys.

1433
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,780
I'm a southern girl.

1434
01:11:44,780 --> 01:11:48,300
I grew up on fried chicken and grits.

1435
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,700
Here's one thing I do love about KFC, is that most of them-

1436
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:52,700
Biscuits.

1437
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:53,700
No, no, no, no.

1438
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,700
Most of them have A&Ws attached to them.

1439
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:55,700
Biscuits.

1440
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,660
A&W root beer is the bomb when it comes out of the tap.

1441
01:11:58,660 --> 01:11:59,660
Biscuits.

1442
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:00,660
There was one time- Biscuits and honey.

1443
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:01,660
All right, biscuits.

1444
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:02,660
We get it.

1445
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,940
There was one time I passed it up and I really wanted to do it.

1446
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:07,900
They were selling root beer in gallon jugs, like the mojo.

1447
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:08,900
They were.

1448
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:09,900
I was like, whoa.

1449
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:10,900
I remember that.

1450
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:11,900
That's good shit.

1451
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:12,900
They were big things.

1452
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,260
They were root beer right out of the tap.

1453
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:15,260
Wow.

1454
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,660
And Julie and I got three of them and drank them in a night.

1455
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:18,660
It was fantastic.

1456
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,220
It was diet reaper.

1457
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,540
Quick comments from the recent phone call there.

1458
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:23,540
We're still live.

1459
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,540
It's been 25 minutes since the maintenance was supposed to start.

1460
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:26,540
We're still live.

1461
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,540
Hey, hey.

1462
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:28,540
God damn life.

1463
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:29,540
You thought I'm screwing us all up.

1464
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:30,540
Oh, well.

1465
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,140
Have you had any sort of retraction notices or anything?

1466
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:33,140
I don't know.

1467
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,140
I'm not even going to bother with it.

1468
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,140
No, they were smart.

1469
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:38,300
They would just say that they're taking the service offline for a while to protest the

1470
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:43,980
whole law going in place, even though they were doing maintenance.

1471
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,980
Don't even get me started.

1472
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,620
You know, I don't see anything about it.

1473
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:48,620
Let me see.

1474
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:50,140
I'm going to check this over.

1475
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:52,780
Meanwhile, raw steel UT says, Rob, it didn't work.

1476
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:54,140
We're still going to eat KFC.

1477
01:12:54,140 --> 01:13:00,420
I don't know, but if a couple people changed their mind, maybe some people would tell you

1478
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,420
it was worth it.

1479
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:05,260
And I showed it to another friend of mine, and another friend of mine played it and said,

1480
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:08,020
oh, wow, you know, I don't want KFC anymore.

1481
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:11,420
The only thing I'm pissed off about KFC is they got rid of their chicken livers.

1482
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:15,780
I used to love those things, and they used to have, I think, some sweet and sour sauce,

1483
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:17,580
and I think they got rid of that stuff too.

1484
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:20,620
I love their sweet and sour sauce.

1485
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:24,500
Josie 16 says, I'm going to order fried chicken right now to protest.

1486
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,300
I used to get their chicken livers all the time.

1487
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,300
They came in a big bucket.

1488
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,300
You get gravy with it.

1489
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,460
Oh, my God, that was so good.

1490
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:33,460
You need to have the chicken livers at Roscoe's, though.

1491
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:34,700
All right.

1492
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,020
That's going to do it for tonight's show.

1493
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:38,620
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

1494
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,620
Loki, we'll start off with you tonight.

1495
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,740
Your final thought.

1496
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:46,580
I get some Bioshock next week, and that makes me happy.

1497
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:51,540
My final thought is ow, tooth, hurt, hate, dentist, cry.

1498
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,140
Darsarha, your final thought.

1499
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:55,180
I think I want some chicken liver right now.

1500
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,180
All right.

1501
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:58,900
Thank you, guys, for tuning in and listening to us tonight.

1502
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:02,780
Thank you to all the live listeners, and sorry the maintenance didn't happen to what was

1503
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:04,340
supposed to happen.

1504
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,340
Very interesting.

1505
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:12,580
No, I'm surprised that PETA hasn't shut down our peep jousting tournaments that we do once

1506
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:16,500
in a while because, you know, marshmallow chickens, they're still chickens.

1507
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,500
All right.

1508
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,780
Well, that's it, guys.

1509
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:22,220
Thank you so much, especially to you podcast folks, also thank you for downloading us and

1510
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:26,500
supporting our show, and thank you for all the positive reviews that some of you left

1511
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,500
on iTunes.

1512
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,340
We always really appreciate stuff like that.

1513
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,740
And thank you for supporting the show, you know, and if you love Orange Lounge Radio,

1514
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:32,740
we do it for free.

1515
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,340
We don't put ads in the show.

1516
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:38,580
Tell two people you know about Orange Lounge Radio, and that's how we spread the word.

1517
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,580
Take a step up.

1518
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,580
Three people.

1519
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:44,380
Independent radio needs your support in order to survive because we don't have any major

1520
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,540
magazines we can run ads in or anything like that.

1521
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,540
So that's it.

1522
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,660
I'll get off my high horse now and sign off.

1523
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:51,020
Goodbye, Loki.

1524
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,020
Goodbye, Dark Sakura.

1525
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,020
Goodbye, me.

1526
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,020
