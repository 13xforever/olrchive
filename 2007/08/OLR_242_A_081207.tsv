14364	19307	Tonight, August 12, 2007, is the Xbox 360 Core on its way out?
19688	25491	New details on Super Mario Galaxy, and is it really possible to now play NES games on your iPhone?
32725	37207	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37227	42350	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42770	48533	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be here with you all night long as will my lovely co-host DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
48793	49293	Hi.
49653	51995	And how are you doing, Jamie?
52335	53195	Full of burrito.
53595	54696	Mmm, yummy burrito.
54816	55837	Shrimpy burritos.
56017	56537	Just shrimp?
56797	57858	No red meat tonight?
58278	60559	No, I'm not going to be eating red meat anymore.
61021	63041	Are you going on one of those funky diet things?
63361	68522	Well, out of necessity, every so often I get to where I can't actually eat it very safely.
68822	71103	Oh, because I was going to say you can't have diet without dye.
72103	72703	I don't diet.
72983	74143	I have lifestyle adjustments.
74803	75123	I see.
76124	77264	That's a clever little workaround.
77724	80284	All right, also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
80504	83805	So would a funky diet be like pizza and disco or something?
83825	85385	I mean, would that be a funky diet?
85405	87346	Would that be eating dirty food?
87446	89766	Why, is that what your life is like right now, disco and pizza?
89786	89826	No.
91089	92650	Yes, everything's all disco and pizza.
93431	94712	Whatever happened to discos?
96154	97995	You know, my mom still calls clubs discos.
98616	99497	The discotheque.
101018	102580	I'm doing okay.
102600	103080	I had pizza.
103440	103901	You had pizza?
104101	104321	Yes.
104581	105062	Was it good pizza?
105566	106066	TheFunkyDiet.com
126776	131339	Just because we don't have the air conditioning yet out there and it's too hot.
131439	132819	So we're in the little studio.
133140	137322	But the good news is we're back on the normal computers and the normal network setup and all that good stuff.
138062	142945	So the sound of the show should be pretty much what you guys are used to, at least I hope.
143205	147707	Save some minor echo and probably things you probably can't even really hear on your iPods.
148128	149288	So we're happy to be back.
149668	151169	And also we're happy to have you back, Jamie.
151409	155512	And I know a lot of folks were thinking about you last week, so I hope everything was okay.
156012	156132	Okay.
156934	157975	It was interesting.
157995	159777	Alright, well, we'll leave it at that.
159937	161318	Let's talk about games instead.
161478	165521	And talk about your interesting experience at California Extreme you just got back from yesterday.
165842	167944	Yes, at, you know, two in the morning.
168824	169425	Oh my god.
169745	171026	What exactly is California Extreme?
171487	174889	It's a pinball and classic gaming convention of sorts.
174930	180494	They had an auction there, but as far as I know it wasn't actually part of California Extreme.
181155	184678	But I did play a whole crap ton of games and finally beat Space Harrier.
185765	188807	I saw your LJ post about beating Space Harrier, so... I sure did.
189507	190408	It was fantastic.
190868	192549	I forgot that it just says the end.
193970	197552	So, they just get a bunch of random games together and call it an expo?
197912	199033	Yeah, some of them are for sale.
199453	199673	Oh, okay.
199693	200294	Well, that's kind of cool.
200434	203596	They had Big Bang Bar, which was the first thing I went right to.
203716	208419	I ran into... Well, actually, I met up with Mel and Melody.
209699	213382	And the first thing that she and I did was go right up and play...
215459	225510	Big Bang Bar which was one of the last machines Capcom made but they only had about 16 prototypes and now there's production models of them.
225931	232858	Well, I should say reproduction models but the one that we played was a legitimate prototype and
234244	236486	Then it was just mostly wandering around.
236946	237667	She was playing Star Wars.
237687	242230	I got to play Ultra Pin, which was kind of interesting.
242671	245033	It's Ultracade's answer to pinball.
245853	247555	Oh, I think you talked about this on the show once.
247615	250357	Isn't it like they use an LCD but laid flat instead?
250737	251357	How does that work?
251938	253099	It was interesting.
253179	255561	The perspective kind of messed with my head a little bit.
256001	259044	But I played Black Knight 2000 on it, which was pretty cool.
260024	262967	And then I was like, screw this and went to play a real Black Knight 2000.
264585	265907	Black Knight Pinball Pinbot
279537	280318	or Jackbot.
280398	281419	Cry and Sadness.
281439	282419	Do they have Bride of Pinbot?
282439	283440	You have Bride of Pinbot in your house.
283460	283700	I have Bride.
283721	284521	No, they didn't have that.
284681	286563	Bride of Pinbot is so badass, by the way.
286863	289865	I played Vortex, which is one of the mid-80s games.
289946	290946	Oh, I remember Vortex.
291126	294349	And that's a cool one, but I played one of the best tables ever.
294369	295170	It's called Airborne.
295190	296631	It's one of Capcom's.
297492	298092	It's all ramps.
298993	299793	It's all ramps.
299854	301835	It's just a bajillion ramps everywhere.
302275	304617	And it was fun, and they had it on like a bajillion buy-ins.
305898	306439	It was crazy.
306679	308981	So did you play anything besides Space Harrier and Pinball?
310287	312888	Um, um, Words.
313068	313629	Yes, I did.
313929	314649	I didn't play Journey.
315149	316030	They got Journey working.
316130	317050	They had Journey?
317510	317751	Yes.
317811	319131	Oh my god, I should have gone.
319191	322133	I was trying to go, but I couldn't because I had other stuff going on.
322313	323313	What else did I play?
323393	325114	Oh, what I would give to play a Journey arcade machine.
325134	325814	I played Mappy.
326955	327175	Huh.
327935	330256	I played, Julie played a bunch of Crystal Castles.
330756	333918	Every time I ran into her, she's either playing Crystal Castles or Pac-Man.
335718	341580	They had a tapper, Rob, that someone had messed with the sprites, and it was all Simpsons characters.
342440	345521	With Moe as the bartender.
345581	346162	That's pretty cool.
347242	353964	I played SVC Chaos, because I had to get my fighting game on.
355224	356225	X-Men vs. Street Fighter
384315	386297	Panic Park
405482	407785	Panic Park is a great game.
407925	413071	I think they have one at Milpitas Golf Land where there's a big one and then there's a small one.
413211	415714	They had an actual Japanese one there, but they had the bad Ingress-y one.
416395	419919	It's a game where one person's on one side and the other person's on another.
419939	421000	You have to play with another person.
421500	423523	You have a big stick and it slides around.
424398	440475	and you are competing with somebody in minigames and it's best however many out of however many and you push them aside or they push you aside using this big stick when you're grabbing hula hoops as they come from the ground or grabbing coins or jumping from thing to thing or avoiding hammers falling on you.
440535	441416	I have never heard of this.
441943	442743	It's fantastic.
443644	446405	And I've actually played with Dan's buddy, Will.
446465	448266	And Will is really strong, okay?
448746	449846	So I had a hard time.
450287	456569	We ended up, he won two matches, I won two matches, and we had a draw of three matches.
456629	458290	So we actually had a perfect draw game.
459184	464127	I got to read some comments from chat because, you know, your comments on old gaming is sparking a lot of discussion in chat.
464147	468189	And, of course, since I haven't introduced them yet, say hello to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
468690	469410	And let's see.
469430	472352	We have GS68 says, I was at Milpitas Golf Land on Thursday.
472372	473673	I don't remember seeing a game like that.
473833	474593	So maybe it wasn't there.
474613	475634	Maybe it was at Sunnyvale or something.
476194	478236	Kevin DDR says, Oh, my God, Panic Park.
478296	478796	Hell, yeah.
479176	480497	So somebody knows what you're talking about there.
481117	482938	Sakura Max says, He's confused.
483259	485800	He's the youngest guy, so he doesn't know about these old-ass games.
486240	487021	Well, it's time to learn.
487776	488036	DarkSakura.com
504605	505325	XBOX LIVE ARCADE
533934	537096	Oh cool, like the little like, what do they call it, Megatouch and that stuff?
537917	540718	Yeah, but they were actually the ones with the controllers and everything on them.
540738	541719	Oh, okay.
541819	551765	And they had an actual Pong, and they had the small child-sized machines, the SNK machines.
552766	553046	Cool.
553887	554927	The Neo Geo ones, sorry.
555748	557169	With like, you know, Puzzle Bobble.
558345	562287	So it sounds like you had a lot of fun, and it sounds like I really missed out getting to see a journey machine.
562307	565908	I did get to find, though, some of my favorite old tables were there, though, like Centaur.
566408	568529	They had a Hyperball, which I refused to ever play again.
569170	570250	Stupid fucking Hyperball.
571771	575532	And they had... I'm sorry, I'm trying to watch my language.
576913	577353	That's all right.
577893	580655	Watch it fly out of your mouth and affect people.
580975	581755	There you go, language.
581775	582335	Have fun.
582355	586037	Did you play any, like, new games this week, or was it all pretty much retro gaming goodness?
586217	586297	Um...
588360	592504	I played the Ultra Pin.
592604	593845	That's technically new.
594285	595666	I played DDR.
596847	597308	I played Max 2.
597688	601892	I played Cowgirl in Flip Flops.
610004	611545	It was actually kind of funny.
611565	613586	I was like, dude, I'm going to fall over.
613666	614147	And I didn't.
614187	614627	It was great.
614687	614887	All right.
614907	618709	Well, next year, the dude with the journey machine needs to come back to California Extreme so I can play it.
619450	620270	Or I'll be sad.
620470	624593	But my World Cup soccer is almost fixed up nice.
626214	628255	Oh, this is what pisses me off.
628295	629175	It's not really an FU.
629215	629676	It's just a...
630918	635881	The one Theater of Magic they had, and the entire place was at the tournament area.
636561	642144	Unless you pay to do the stupid tournament, and you can't play the Theater of Magic, and I'm like, I want to play Theater of Magic!
642344	643285	Theater of Magic's pretty badass.
643305	644646	I did play the Devil Madness, though.
645266	646867	I knocked down the castle, it was great.
647187	652050	Alright, we gotta move on, but it sounds like you got a lot of good gaming in, even if most of it was pinball, not console games.
652590	653250	Pinball's pretty rad.
653891	654791	Loki, how was your gaming week?
655311	655912	It was okay.
656572	659954	Before I get into my gaming week, though, I wanted to talk about, there was this game that I saw
660540	661421	Neo Geo Battle Coliseum
673351	675111	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
699295	700196	from King of Monsters.
700736	701576	That's all kinds of rap.
725863	754889	and then I also tried the Fatal Inertia demo which you know I've been really hyped up about the game ever since they first announced it because it reminded me of like you know kind of like F-Zero GX or something like that you know a combat racing game that was not the case with this this is crap and I thank god I played the demo because I'm not buying the game now it's just it's hard to control and it didn't seem that fast and I don't know I just didn't like the level layout it wasn't pretty enough for me so
756104	756344	Oh well.
756785	768614	And then, let's see, I also played 300 on the PSP because I had just watched the Blu-ray for it, so that game sucked also.
769635	770215	But what do you expect?
770255	770496	Why?
771196	772497	It's just a hack and slash game.
772537	773838	It's like a movie tie-in game.
773858	775279	Well, isn't that what the movie was?
775800	776080	I don't know.
776120	776761	I didn't see the movie.
776781	778282	Yeah, the movie was a lot better than that.
778502	779563	I'm the one guy that didn't see 300.
779603	779903	I don't know.
781573	788959	And then, um, I've been playing, actually, strangely enough, uh, well, Overlord I've been playing, and that game's still really fun.
789799	796464	Um, I've also been playing, uh, this is gonna be really weird, um, Settlers of Catan, actually.
797125	805031	And, uh, because I got hooked on this yesterday, actually, I was playing the actual board game, uh, with my sister and her boyfriend, and...
805856	811858	It's really fun, so I bought the Xbox Live Arcade game, and it's pretty much the same thing, except the AI is completely cheap.
812038	817420	But other than that, the only thing I really wish it had was local multiplayer instead of just over live.
818460	820781	That would be pretty cool, but they didn't.
821341	823282	But this game has passed the wife test, right?
823502	826323	Oh yeah, the wife is probably playing it right now, actually.
826343	826763	That's amazing.
827163	829004	Yeah, she was playing it all afternoon, so...
829830	830090	Crimey River.
830150	830391	Crimey River.
852938	871402	Alright, somebody in chat earlier, and I apologize, I forgot who said it, somebody had said, what's more funny than watching Grand Theft Auto 4 get delayed is watching everything else back out of its way now that it's been delayed, everything else is getting delayed because of that, or, you know, the other games that all kind of moved out of way, like the ripple effect that Grand Theft Auto is having, kind of interesting.
872536	876599	Looking at the chatroom and talking about some quotes there.
877740	879522	What is it the Rob D said that was really funny?
879622	884205	Oh, about the Battle Coliseum game and how I said Mai could fight one of the King of the Monsters.
884506	887868	Sky just wants to see Mai versus a tentacle monster, let's face it.
888409	891911	That quote coming from the Rob D. Let's see.
892031	893773	Apparently the Rob D didn't see 300 either.
894573	895774	So I guess I'm not the only one ever.
896635	897616	Let's see what else is there.
899217	899297	Uh...
901624	903485	RossDLUT impersonates Loki.
903885	905526	Durr, I'm going to play this movie game.
905546	907207	Maybe it'll suck less than all the others.
908707	911428	I suppose saying that all movie games usually suck.
912229	914870	For the most part, they do.
914990	917071	I mean, there's some movie games that are okay.
917231	920332	I remember some of the NES Batman games weren't that bad.
920352	921373	Oh, yeah, that's true.
923028	937459	and I actually liked the Friday the 13th game like it always ends up on like these worst NES games of all times list but that game actually scared me when I was a kid because it was kind of a scary game I don't know anyway but yeah movie games usually not not so much fun let's see
938695	939656	Games I've been playing this week.
939696	940897	Not a lot of new stuff, unfortunately.
940937	942138	I've been on World of Warcraft.
942178	947883	I'm really grinding like hell in World of Warcraft to try and get my character to level 70, so I'll be all ready by the time the next expansion comes out.
949524	954588	And also, the fact is that I know all these console games are coming out very soon, especially when we get into the end of August.
954928	962034	Blue Dragon, Eternal Sonata, Halo, and then Metroid Prime 3 and all these games I'm going to want to be playing are all coming out soon.
962054	965457	So I want to get as much grinding in as I can before I get distracted by the console games.
966137	968579	So most of my week has been spent on the PC playing WoW.
968920	971262	Otherwise, though, I have been playing some other console games.
971922	977146	I was playing Kingdom Hearts 2 more, and I finally surpassed my first save game, so I guess that's kind of cool.
977607	986354	Otherwise, I checked out probably like all the... because I was without internet for a little while, because, you know, if you listened to last week's show, you know Comcast finally didn't come out here until Tuesday.
986674	991338	And by the way, let me say, Comcast said they were going to come here in a window between 12 and 4.
991438	992579	You know what time they finally got here?
992599	993540	7.30, 8 o'clock.
995228	999731	You know what, then I would... Don't you get some money or something off your bill?
999851	1000571	We got a $20 credit.
1000751	1001872	Ooh, whoopee!
1001892	1002573	Whoopee-doo!
1002813	1008256	Whoopee-doo, that's like... Then they installed all this shit we didn't ask for, like all the HBO and Showtime channels.
1008276	1009157	We didn't want that shit.
1009437	1013579	I mean, it was cool for one night, because I got to watch Big Brother After Dark, which is kind of cheesy fun.
1013960	1015441	But yeah, we had to get rid of that.
1015641	1016961	They just totally screwed up the order.
1016981	1019223	I'm actually surprised they remembered to put the HD in there.
1019243	1020464	It's bad.
1020504	1020964	It's bad.
1022205	1027029	So yeah, otherwise my gaming week's been pretty light in that regard, just mostly World of Warcraft.
1027149	1031913	But I will be kicking back into high gear when we get into the end of the month.
1032173	1033454	Oh, the Xbox Live Arcade games.
1033494	1035696	I did catch up on all those ones I missed while I was out.
1036196	1037417	I didn't really care for any of them.
1037858	1039279	I played like four.
1039379	1041440	I didn't like the Spyglass board games.
1041861	1042481	I didn't like...
1043822	1045523	Super, well, Super Contra was okay.
1045603	1047284	I mean, you know, and Track and Field is okay.
1047304	1050426	Surprisingly, I actually think I played Track and Field more than any of the other ones.
1050466	1052508	I was thinking about buying Track and Field.
1052648	1053809	It just looks stupid.
1054049	1057111	Like, it's just back and forth with the analog stick, isn't it?
1057851	1063695	Well, that or you can use the buttons, because the actual arcade machine used buttons, like giant poppin' music style buttons.
1063715	1068398	Or you know what I suggest doing, since I think, aren't the controls completely configurable and stuff like that?
1069369	1070370	DDR pads, man.
1070410	1073432	Get out the DDR pads and bust it out like track and field.
1074153	1074493	Maybe.
1074873	1075194	I don't know.
1076234	1081799	It's not the most thrilling game ever, but for some reason I like those old retro games, so it's fun to me.
1082459	1090045	But I don't know if I'd actually recommend it to a lot of people, because it's certainly not one of the better Konami arcade ports that's on Marketplace.
1090697	1094878	Anyway, let's move on and get into some housekeeping so we can get to tonight's news.
1121311	1121912	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1137964	1165869	and they highlighted us this week as kind of like they were mentioning all the podcasts they had that week and they had themselves because Joystick does their own podcast but they're a little bit irregular but I guess they did two weeks in a row so they were nominating themselves for having done two weeks in a row like saying hooray for us and then they followed up with us and saying well now we have these guys who've been doing it for years and years so that was just kind of funny so we appreciate the plug but it's hilarious that it happened the week that our show was like totally broken and like Jamie wasn't even here and
1166149	1168190	And then we had all the sound issues we had last week.
1168270	1168811	It was nuts.
1168991	1175775	And what the listeners couldn't see last week is I was also trying to read stories while keeping the spaghetti away from my cat.
1175855	1179538	Because I had a plate of spaghetti and she kept trying to attack the plate.
1179778	1181659	The sound was so horrible last week.
1182219	1185862	And then for some reason, there was little packet losses throughout the file.
1185882	1190145	So suddenly you'd be... And then the words would drop out.
1190205	1190625	It was bad.
1191010	1192910	I almost felt like I was gonna burst into flames, you know?
1216798	1220660	You know, we almost had a webcam tonight, but I just didn't get it set up in time.
1220720	1224982	But speaking of Apple, my little Apple webcam and the laptop, so I can have it wherever.
1225002	1227403	But we're going to wait until we move out to the garage to do that, so it'll be fun.
1227623	1229845	You know who else likes that Seller is a Catan?
1230005	1230265	What's that?
1230285	1230625	My cat.
1230945	1235487	She'll sit there in front of the TV and watch the dice move and the cards move and stuff.
1235788	1237528	She's completely fascinated by it.
1237989	1238549	It's awesome.
1239485	1240045	XBOX 360 Core Model
1262342	1267805	I kind of theorize that this might be happening, although I don't think it's anytime soon that it's going to happen.
1268405	1282291	But the theory behind it is, other than the fact that it is showing discontinued in their system, is that they're replacing all of the current premium systems out there with the ones with HDMI, but they're not doing that with the core system.
1282431	1287273	So people are thinking, okay, well, they're going to just sell out the core system and then discontinue it.
1288514	1288774	I don't know.
1290464	1292705	Did Microsoft maybe do something to Target?
1292945	1296386	Because I noticed Target also, aren't they phasing out HD DVDs?
1296586	1298067	I seem to remember that was a previous report.
1298267	1299627	I think it was Target that was doing that.
1299647	1305329	Well, they're phasing them out of their store, but if you've ever gone into Target looking for HD product anyways...
1306054	1310777	Their shelving that they have is like, it's literally maybe 12 movies that they have there.
1310957	1313178	Blu-ray and HD DVD combined.
1313298	1317981	Yeah, I wouldn't exactly consider Target my number one stop for HD DVD purchasing.
1318061	1319301	And it's only in store.
1319321	1320742	I think they have them still on the website.
1320922	1328086	It's a little disheartening, though, to see HD DVDs be phased out when, you know, I spent as much money as I did on the HD player for the 360.
1328486	1329927	It's my bad.
1329947	1330988	It's all numbers.
1331048	1334810	I mean, if their Blu-ray product is selling and their HD is not, then...
1335290	1340553	And then hopefully with season 2 or something they'll do it where you can download the episodes right after they air, that'd be awesome.
1359386	1366249	Well, Target isn't the only place that's phasing out the Xbox 360 Core model, according to some rumors out there right now.
1366729	1369351	And the other store that is phasing them out, Best Buy.
1370411	1379135	Best Buy, as apparently a little screenshot has come out of their system, shown that the status of the Xbox 360 Core hardware in their system was deleted on July 29, 2007.
1381977	1386399	So Microsoft denies that there's any type of Core production being stocked.
1387575	1388836	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1407927	1408287	and DarkSakura.
1425992	1429834	or it actually is something coming from Microsoft saying, hey, we're getting rid of the core model.
1431195	1433276	I don't think that's actually been announced yet.
1433576	1437958	So if that is going to happen, probably won't happen until after Christmas.
1438778	1441039	Wow, lots and lots of comments from chat on this one.
1441740	1444601	DJ Dark Knight says, Sears has never had the core models.
1445307	1445967	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1465030	1469033	Raven's Dolphin says, when Walmart says no more Core 360s, then it's done.
1469813	1471894	RawSteelUT says, of course Microsoft would deny.
1472255	1475537	They probably also deny that the Core only counts for maybe 20% of their sales.
1476377	1479699	Bandit says they should keep the Core for people who want to upgrade their memory later on.
1479759	1481160	It'll be more accessible to everyone.
1481260	1485883	Well, I don't think they were going to announce the HDMI thing either until it leaked out, so, you know...
1486523	1486823	I don't know.
1487084	1497073	If you want to join our chat room and give your comments, if you're listening live here on this Sunday night when we tape live, chat.orangeloungeradio.com By the way, some other chatters following up on the whole Target HD DVD thing.
1497393	1501777	GS191 says this, Target is not getting rid of HD DVD.
1501857	1506701	The Blu-ray camp just inked a deal for their product to be displayed more through the end of the year.
1506842	1510064	Wonder Dog Harold follows that up with a web link that says that's true.
1510225	1511666	So, very interesting.
1515662	1524664	Honestly, myself, being that I've got a Blu-ray player, then... But you don't have an HD DVD player, right?
1524944	1525184	Nope.
1525364	1527985	That's one of the things you don't have in your house, amazingly enough.
1528065	1528485	One of them.
1528705	1529965	Amongst all the other crap you have.
1530025	1531746	You don't have an HD DVD player, though.
1532046	1535226	No, I actually know more people who have Blu-ray players myself.
1535246	1536927	Well, because they're built into the PlayStation 3s.
1536987	1538007	You don't own PlayStation 3s.
1538487	1538807	Really?
1539247	1543788	The new VIOs come built in with Blu-ray players.
1544614	1548875	See, Sony just used... I mean, you know, if HD DVD loses, then it loses.
1548915	1552157	Fine, I went with the wrong format, but... I'm surprised.
1552217	1556398	Sony is really pushing with all their... Because, you know, Sony is not just a gaming company.
1556458	1566501	They are an electronics company and a major one at that, so it's kind of... They've been able to sneak Blu-ray into all these other little places, and it's worked for them, where, for whatever reason, Beta didn't.
1567342	1571123	Well, you know, there is still some hope, though, for people who...
1572759	1579884	I guess it's not specifically HD related, but they are dropping the price of the Xbox 360.
1581705	1588349	It actually said that it was scheduled to happen on August 8th, so the price reduction should already be in place.
1589829	1594052	So we are seeing the Elite model go to $449, the Pro model to $349, and the Core at $279.
1594092	1594192	So
1599656	1605680	And of course the premium had the biggest drop, given that that's the best seller.
1606460	1609182	And that price drop was totally a surprise to me.
1610583	1612424	And everybody out there on the internet.
1612464	1615265	Yes, the entire internet was shocked and awed at that price drop.
1615706	1625972	I'm actually curious though, well I guess I don't think we have any stories on this tonight, so I can say that, I think I want to say I read somewhere that Amazon, you know, the sales of the Xbox 360 went through the roof after the price drop.
1626272	1629454	So I'm just kind of curious if the same thing happened to retail outlets or what happened.
1630929	1633190	Are you surprised they made the move at this time?
1633530	1636792	Because I'm actually kind of a little surprised they didn't wait until a little closer to Christmas.
1637393	1640154	Like I would have expected the price drop a little more October-ish.
1640695	1646658	But maybe then again with Halo 3 coming out when it is, maybe they wanted to do it in advance of Halo 3, which would certainly make sense.
1647819	1648219	So who knows?
1649961	1658426	I was just going to mention there was another story I remember reading, I guess, that the NPD group did a survey with people saying, you know, kind of...
1659056	1662399	Asking them whether they're aware of different features of their console.
1662439	1667344	And I guess there was like almost like 60% of people didn't realize that the PlayStation 3 had a Blu-ray player in it.
1667844	1669786	Or had never used it for like Blu-ray movies.
1670747	1671808	Which I thought that was a little bit funny.
1672889	1673169	Anywho.
1673409	1675331	What I want to know is what are they using it for then?
1675671	1676272	Motorstorm?
1676772	1677473	Is that it?
1678034	1679655	The basketball game that's on it?
1679715	1680095	Is that it?
1680256	1682678	It must be all that wonderful download content that's online.
1682738	1683539	Oh wait, no, that's right.
1683559	1683759	Huh.
1684831	1688673	Um, anyways, other countries are also getting a 360 price drop.
1688713	1691714	In fact, Canadians are seeing a pretty big price drop.
1691754	1698738	They will see a $100, um, of course that's in Canadian money, um, drop on the premium and core systems.
1699238	1700319	So that's pretty awesome.
1700939	1708082	And, um, yeah, so after that price drop, uh, the premium will be running, I guess, approximately $378 US.
1708102	1713925	You know, still, you know, of course with the exchange rates, uh,
1714312	1715252	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1736521	1737522	Thanks for watching!
1756752	1758913	There wasn't really a whole lot else to that firmware update.
1759213	1766616	You know, it's kind of a bummer, too, because, you know, when you turn on your Xbox 360 and you see, ooh, a new firmware update is available, you kind of start to get a little bit excited.
1766636	1770237	Like, ooh, I wonder what new features they've added this week, you know, or what they're adding.
1770277	1772258	Or is this the big seasonal update?
1772278	1775039	Because they do a big one in fall and I think spring.
1775079	1777900	Of course, it's summer, so that wouldn't make sense for my brain to go there.
1777940	1782102	But you can still help but get a little bit excited when the thing comes up and says there's a firmware update.
1782122	1783562	Like, ooh, what cool new feature are they going to add?
1783903	1784883	And then it turns out to be nothing.
1786423	1786663	Oh well.
1786703	1787184	That poo.
1787624	1789625	Oh well, I mean... That big stinky poop.
1789725	1794068	It was unexpected, so it's, you know, can't really beg for a lot with that.
1794588	1811478	For anybody who is actually excited about anything having to do with Halo, well, Halo 3, I should say, or likes having green Xbox 360s, the Halo-themed Xbox 360 will be out in September, priced for $399 with a wireless headset for $59.99.
1811518	1811558	Um...
1818496	1820757	I don't really see anything all that special about it.
1820817	1822538	It says it's Spartan green and gold.
1822618	1828800	Really, it looks to me like it's baby poop green with orange.
1828820	1830581	At least that's what it looks like.
1832762	1836484	As far as your HDMI cables, that comes separately.
1837704	1840005	That's exactly how they should market it, too.
1840025	1842426	You have an HDMI port.
1843527	1845027	Well, they all have the HDMI port now.
1845067	1846008	But no cable.
1846576	1851820	Really, the only thing that you get for the extra $50 is you get a plain charge kit that's also the, I guess, baby poop green.
1852481	1857024	And you get the wonderful baby poop green paint job.
1857965	1859606	It does look like baby poo.
1859666	1860487	It's that type of green.
1860527	1863369	If you do want HDMI cables, those will cost you about $50.
1864230	1870995	And they're going to be sold separately, actually, now that all the 360s, the premiums with the HDMI are coming up.
1872535	1873696	So, yay!
1873837	1877360	You get the... There's no Halo 3 with it, even.
1877621	1878982	Which is kind of, come on.
1879082	1880704	I mean, why didn't they do that?
1880964	1885710	Because you know there's people that are going to go out and buy their Xbox 360 the day that Halo 3 comes out.
1886090	1888873	They're going to finally make that upgrade, because they've been playing Halo 2 this whole time.
1889094	1892457	And in case you forgot, there are also two custom Halo 3...
1894864	1896145	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1921506	1928612	SonOfDad in our chatroom at chat.orangeloungeradio.com calls the new color Split Pea in Halo Chunky Style Xbox 360.
1929832	1930273	Delicious.
1931674	1932354	Mmm, yummy.
1933655	1938379	Well, anyways, speaking of Halo 3, apparently there are a lot of fans out there.
1938399	1939420	You know, who knew?
1941037	1947203	Halo 3 has become the fastest-selling pre-ordered game in history.
1947863	1954028	Apparently, 1 million pre-orders have been taken in North America, a new record, apparently, for those keeping track.
1956150	1965298	Also, this all ties in with their marketing campaign, including 7-Eleven, Burger King, Comcast, Mountain Dew, and Pontiac.
1966903	1970845	Honestly, Pontiac, how the fuck does that relate to Halo?
1971225	1976488	I can understand the 7-Eleven, because you have that Halo Mountain Dew crap and stuff that you can sell that.
1976948	1981750	Alright, and then maybe Burger King, because it's on their cups and shit, and maybe there's some kids' toys or something.
1981970	1983971	But Pontiac, come on.
1984452	1986472	There's nothing to... Seriously.
1986793	1988393	Are you going to hop on the bandwagon?
1988453	1990454	Are you really that hard up in selling your cars?
1990474	1991555	Maybe they're going to make tanks.
1995322	1996263	I think that's pretty funny.
1996523	1999064	Maybe Pontiac's getting into the war car building business.
2000885	2003667	But really, would you want a war car made by Pontiac?
2005047	2009370	I mean, that's just like, you know, this is my Volkswagen killing machine.
2009430	2011071	I mean, it's crap.
2011451	2015513	No, no, no, because remember, Volkswagen wouldn't lend their likenesses for that kind of thing.
2016353	2020796	I'd buy the Volkswagen one before I'd buy a Ford one, that's for sure.
2020816	2022057	Found on road dead.
2023357	2024618	The fix-off and repair daily.
2025458	2029981	I hope they release like a Covenant car and a Spartan car that you can have the fucking Halo fans.
2030061	2033023	I'm going to fucking kill you in my Spartan car.
2033244	2033864	Yeah, that's right.
2034304	2035685	It's better than your Covenant car.
2036046	2037727	Actually, I'm driving a Pontiac.
2037747	2038487	You're both losers.
2038567	2042350	I'd buy a Pontiac if they put guns in the front of it so I can shoot people who get in my way.
2042570	2043751	I mean, come on.
2044966	2045586	All right, maybe not.
2046147	2050069	But I wanted to say about this, how is Halo 3 tied into the Comcast thing?
2050089	2054771	Because we didn't get a baby shit green cable box.
2054831	2055271	Here's why.
2055291	2060814	They're going to have videos on their Comcast on-demand service, the service that I never use ever.
2061614	2062855	They're going to have that on there.
2063786	2064967	Hooray!
2065107	2066349	Are they even going to bother and do it next game?
2066369	2069532	I guess it justifies them raising the rates on their cable.
2070032	2070673	Oh, thank you!
2070753	2072755	I get Halo exclusive content!
2073376	2074937	And you're raising my rates and they're $5!
2075618	2077100	Thank you, Comcast!
2080683	2081284	Boof.
2082094	2090879	Oh, I could just imagine my roommate's reaction if, you know, because it was bad enough when they only offered him the $20 discount for wasting his whole day and then, like, fucking up his total order.
2090939	2096181	I could just imagine if the thing had been, you know, oh, well, we're really sorry about the inconvenience.
2096201	2098142	Here's some free Halo 3 trailers.
2099263	2099783	Yay.
2100183	2100303	Ah!
2100604	2103025	Joy plus rapture equals no.
2104606	2104846	Wow.
2106303	2106823	Interesting.
2106883	2115849	Yeah, I'm not surprised about the whole pre-order record-breaking thing, because like what you said, the whole 7-Eleven tie-ins, like we talked about last week, how you can pre-order Halo 3 at 7-Eleven now.
2116369	2117030	It's crazy.
2117450	2121913	And then just the fact that, you know, many, many stores whore their pre-orderings now.
2121933	2126996	They've all taken a page from GameStop, and of course GameStop's still king of their game every time somebody comes in.
2127016	2128136	Did you want to reserve Halo 3?
2128597	2129337	Did you want to reserve Halo 3?
2129557	2131258	Oh, I see you're buying Bratz for the DS.
2131298	2132059	Did you want to reserve Halo 3?
2132099	2132179	Yeah.
2133849	2137091	It's like, hey, you want to buy Madden from us?
2137111	2138512	We'll give you a free mini poster.
2140112	2140573	No!
2140973	2141833	I don't like Madden.
2142494	2143014	How about Halo 3?
2143614	2144255	Fuck off!
2145795	2148117	I'm sorry, I've been hearing about nothing but Madden lately.
2148237	2148957	You just bought Halo 3.
2149097	2150358	Do you want to pre-order Halo 3?
2151919	2155901	Every time I call Dan's store, it's like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, reserve Madden.
2156161	2156401	No!
2157941	2161984	I can imagine walking into GameStop, yes, I'm here to reserve Halo 3.
2162784	2163265	Oh, great!
2163565	2165326	Would you like to reserve Halo 4 while you're at it?
2165927	2173452	I mean, if anyone, if they should have partnered up with a car dealership or a car company, it should have been, like, the fucking Hummer.
2173832	2176114	Because at least that's the size of the Warthog, okay?
2176254	2176674	A Humvee.
2177055	2178576	A Humvee, whatever.
2180697	2185581	The other thing I'm kind of curious about with all this is...
2187502	2189635	I know what I wanted to say earlier that I couldn't think of.
2191201	2199744	I think one of the worst trends in retail across the board that I've seen now is fake boxes to try to get you to pre-order the game.
2199764	2205286	You'll be walking down Best Buy and go, oh, I didn't know this game was out, and you reach for it and you grab it, and then it's like, oh, a little sticker.
2205306	2205766	That's the point.
2205866	2206506	Pre-order.
2206606	2209507	I know, and it's a horrible, horrible trick that I always fall for.
2209567	2213149	Last summer, they had Madden 08 already in GameStop.
2213209	2213969	I kid you not.
2213989	2216570	They made up their own box art so you can pre-order Madden 08.
2216870	2219831	This was literally weeks after Madden 07 came out.
2221004	2221605	I mean, come on.
2222125	2222505	Seriously.
2223927	2231474	Tigerclaw says, Sky, I went to GameStop on Saturday and one of the employees, for some bizarre reason, was wearing a cardboard box over his head.
2232195	2234377	Did it say pre-order Halo 3 on the top, maybe?
2234637	2234957	I don't know.
2235598	2240603	And the other thing, do we really need press releases that go out when your game's put out?
2240803	2242484	It's the fastest selling game ever!
2242865	2245227	Until the next game comes out and then it'll sell more.
2245908	2246188	You know...
2246756	2247257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2254269	2256590	Everyone knew Halo 3 was in existence.
2257210	2282081	Alright, anyhow, let's move on off the Halo 3 talk, because there's plenty of other things on the Xbox 360 people are looking forward to, including the next round of Xbox Live Arcade games, and there's a lot of games slated to be coming out over the next couple months, including the much-anticipated Hexic 2, also Echo the Dolphin, War World, Geon Emotions, Puzzle Quest, yay, Space Giraffe,
2282441	2288488	Streets of Rage 2, and of course Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix
2289944	2291585	I'm actually very much looking forward to that game
2320184	2321365	Could be interesting, I know.
2321625	2322806	That's kind of what I thought when I read that.
2322826	2324987	I'm like, so they want you to make more power gems?
2325087	2330851	Okay, okay, Drenami, you don't use Dan unless you think that you're like God's gift to Puzzle Fighter.
2331192	2334254	Or if you want to have a really hilarious Dan versus Dan match.
2334814	2336875	Because he does nothing but drop red blocks.
2337836	2339477	Exactly, that's awesome.
2339917	2342339	Oh, the chat room is daring to correct me.
2342379	2347442	Hitstun says, there's an X dash mode with the new drop patterns, but there's also the original X mode.
2348203	2348583	My bad.
2349804	2350144	and DarkSakura.
2380257	2388839	We have a label of Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 1 on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness to be out in the fall.
2389439	2394721	This one surprised me at all because there's already Penny Arcade content on Xbox Live and has been for a long, long time.
2395101	2399902	Because you can get themes and little clip arts or the little gamer pictures and stuff.
2399962	2400882	I hope it's amazing.
2403803	2407004	If it's anything less than amazing, I'll be like, well, crap.
2407805	2408965	I'll probably download it anyway.
2409025	2420569	But it wouldn't surprise me at all if there ended up being a Penny Arcade game on the marketplace because Microsoft's kind of like that lately is that they're really trying to get into those fan communities and the thing that the internet's all abuzz about.
2420609	2421669	Microsoft wants a part of that.
2421729	2423890	Well, there's nothing actually confirmed yet.
2424630	2426091	All they'd have to do is throw money at them.
2426991	2428551	Money is what moves the world.
2428771	2429532	Exactly.
2430692	2430992	Awesome.
2431471	2432732	Thanks for watching!
2448246	2448686	Cool!
2448766	2450207	I want to get Madden on the Atari.
2450227	2451728	I want it on the Turbo Duo!
2451868	2453670	Have you seen the Simpsons game trailer?
2453870	2454730	It actually has that.
2454750	2462395	It says, coming out for all game systems, and it shows the Coleco, Atari, Intellivision, Jaguar.
2463156	2465037	Dude, they should put it out on those systems.
2465057	2465818	That would be rad.
2465898	2470941	Anyways, so no, it is coming out on most everything, I think, except for the Game Boy Advance.
2472202	2477365	Also, if you're not into Madden, on PlayStation 2, Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3,
2478606	2479727	It's coming out on PlayStation 2.
2480327	2483488	By the way, I brought my copy for you so you can try it out.
2483728	2484068	Hooray!
2485609	2487950	And then, let's see, Metropolis Mania 2.
2488890	2489771	That's also coming out.
2492011	2495273	Let's see, Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1.
2496773	2497994	Yay.
2498674	2500915	On PSP, Dungeons & Dragons Tactics.
2502275	2504036	Ghost Recon... Oh, no, that's next week.
2504156	2504836	Sorry, sorry.
2505837	2505937	Um...
2507461	2513263	Let's see, other than that... Oh, DS!
2513564	2514764	DS, there's some good stuff.
2516025	2518125	Let's see, Luminous Ark, that's supposed to be pretty good.
2518206	2520667	Rune Factory, a fantasy Harvest Moon.
2521487	2523968	How many Harvest Moon games will come out this year?
2524028	2524968	That's a good question.
2525569	2528910	Heroes of Mana, that's supposed to be actually pretty good on the DS.
2530010	2533432	Operation Vietnam, and High School Musical...
2534640	2535241	Making the cut.
2536202	2538065	And yeah, that's pretty much it.
2538385	2539567	It's Madden or nothing.
2541549	2542330	Alright, well I'm out.
2542350	2543512	I thought it was Nerf or nothing.
2545214	2545895	Not anymore.
2546568	2552970	I'm heading over to the Japanese release dates, and I'm here to tell you there's not a goddamn thing worth noting coming out in Japan this week.
2553471	2553771	Nothing.
2554191	2554671	There's nothing.
2555111	2556352	Absolutely nothing coming out over there.
2557232	2560793	However, if you happen to live in Korea, you're getting some of the same things we are.
2560853	2565375	You're also getting Persona 3 on the PlayStation 2, but otherwise, it's a very slow week.
2566015	2566616	Nothing of note.
2566996	2570317	I mean, I guess there's a couple small titles, but nothing worth mentioning, honestly.
2570757	2571337	So, slow week.
2572578	2573898	Well, yeah, it's about the same.
2573918	2575219	I'm over in the UK right now.
2576055	2578518	Premier Manager 08, and Two Worlds.
2580261	2581422	Slow times.
2581643	2582304	That's it.
2582404	2585388	However, lucky people getting Blue Dragon on the 24th.
2585849	2586469	I think we are, too.
2587030	2587311	Yep.
2587871	2589313	So hey, we get something at the same time.
2589874	2591737	And they're getting Blazing Angels later, too.
2592546	2593627	Very cool.
2593867	2595929	And this is just the calm before the storm right here.
2596729	2603694	August is always the slow period, so we're going to start seeing things really pick up very soon here, like Blue Dragon, Metroid Prime 3.
2603855	2607237	Then we get into next month and the Halo, everything.
2607277	2608498	It's going to be a mess.
2608578	2613562	There's a to-be-announced on here for Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System.
2614743	2615804	We need to get a date on that.
2616604	2617665	I thought that already came out.
2617905	2618866	It came out in Japan, yeah.
2618886	2620247	That was last week's releases in Japan.
2621152	2624934	It's sating, pending for the UK, but nothing specific.
2625315	2626655	I wish it would come out over here.
2626675	2630998	Why don't they put out a press release saying that's the crappiest title for a game, or a Final Fantasy game.
2632965	2637488	TheRobD would like to say August ain't slow this year because you're getting a Bioshock and Madden and everything.
2637508	2641450	Yeah, I know, I know, but I'm saying like, you know, that's all towards the end of the month.
2641470	2642470	Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2642530	2644511	I want to play Blue Dragon and Bioshock.
2644551	2646272	Well, not Blue Dragon.
2646312	2647393	I'm talking about the other stuff.
2648113	2649674	Well, just because you guys are anti-Madden.
2649694	2652315	It's still a slow month, even though those games are coming out.
2652455	2653436	I mean, look at it.
2653496	2658739	Okay, so Bioshock, that's coming out next week, in the week of the 21st, and, well...
2662256	2662656	That's it.
2663296	2663617	I see.
2663637	2669339	So basically you're saying the problem with this month is that you just have these few A-list titles kind of tent-pulling us through the month.
2669399	2669719	Pretty much.
2669759	2670480	There's not a lot of other stuff.
2670500	2679263	Bioshock's next week, and then the week after that you've got the Blue Dragon, Metroid Prime 3, Stuntman Ignition, Tiger Woods 08, and stuff like that.
2679563	2682665	But that's pretty much it for the rest of the month.
2682825	2689968	September is crazy, and then beyond that it's just... I don't even want to... I fear November.
2690839	2695861	I'm sorry, Blue Dragon's the only one out of that list that I'm looking forward to.
2696301	2698602	I'm not as looking forward to Metroid Prime 3 as you might think.
2698682	2703223	I was very, very, very disappointed that Nintendo did not decide to go online multiplayer with it.
2703243	2704464	We need a Metroid Metroid.
2706064	2706885	Like old school Metroid?
2706925	2707085	Yes.
2707205	2708485	Well, we get them on virtual console.
2708505	2709205	There's nothing else.
2709225	2709966	Next week, I think.
2710106	2712146	We need an actual new Metroid game.
2712486	2713607	We need Metroid Wii.
2714387	2714807	We'll see.
2715167	2716008	Metroid Metroid.
2716028	2717128	We love Metroid.
2717348	2717928	But that's Metroid Prime 3.
2717968	2718008	No.
2720077	2720357	You want a 2D?
2720377	2722099	You need to be specific.
2722119	2723480	You want a 2D Metroid on the Wii?
2723740	2725662	I want a 2D Metroid on the Wii.
2725902	2734429	Or like, you know how the Sega Ages Fantasy Zone is with the 3D, 2D look?
2736090	2736791	You need something like that.
2736811	2745138	I don't know if you heard, but there's rumors going around saying that Castlevania Aria of Sorrow is going to be shown at Let's Big on the PC.
2746247	2749830	And so if it's on the PC, then it could ideally come to consoles.
2750770	2753212	And that was the Game Boy Advance one, so... Well, we'll see.
2754613	2756335	Let's go ahead and move on and get back into some news.
2757896	2762179	Anywho, so we were talking a little bit earlier about firmware updates for the 360.
2762980	2770965	Well, the Wii couldn't be left out, so they decided to update to version 3, which you get some spiffy shit with that.
2771426	2771506	Um...
2772682	2779006	Now, nothing major like the Check Me Out channel or anything like that, but you get a wonderful digital clock.
2780327	2780807	Hurrah.
2781547	2785049	And the forecast channel now displays the current condition.
2785930	2787571	Yet it doesn't display the temperature.
2788331	2794515	And the current condition is still, like, I'll boot up my Wii at like 4 o'clock in the evening and it shows a picture of a moon.
2795839	2796700	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2814155	2823099	The message board now has today's accomplishments message as a white message which will allow it to stand out from other messages.
2823599	2826240	I still hate those today's accomplishment things.
2827860	2835243	Address book can now be shifted around using A and B. Calendar no longer shows today's accomplishments.
2836403	2840405	Scrolling messages in the Wii message board now use a different sound.
2841517	2846718	I guess in the Wii Shop channel, they've got some other stuff you can search by category, publisher, genre.
2847838	2850739	But you still can't look at videos within the Wii Shop channel.
2851179	2853499	You have to go onto the internet to see that.
2854179	2864821	And then, of course, you know, there's some settings, I guess, warning added to pre-system update detailing that technically modified consoles may cease to function.
2865281	2866762	So we break your mod chips!
2867482	2867982	That's right.
2868722	2868822	Um...
2869278	2869638	GameCubeGames.com
2893972	2900317	One other thing that should be said is the Wii system update also made the USB keyboards now start working.
2900917	2908602	You can actually plug in a USB keyboard into the back of the Wii and you can use your keyboard for the message board messages.
2908742	2910824	You can use it to type in some things.
2911444	2915447	You can use it when you're writing questions for everybody votes or whatever.
2916047	2918369	You can also do the internet channel.
2918629	2919049	Hooray.
2919430	2922572	However, you can't use it in the shop channel to search.
2923332	2924892	and I don't know what that's about.
2926293	2927613	Can you use it in the internet channel?
2927633	2928593	Because I thought you couldn't.
2929693	2930553	Apparently you can.
2930633	2931434	I'm pretty sure you can.
2931454	2933094	I don't know.
2933134	2933814	I'll have to try it.
2934134	2938335	I bought a USB keyboard for Final Fantasy XI for the 360 and then I stopped playing.
2938675	2940495	So I have one sitting out there that I don't really use.
2940535	2941335	And it glows blue.
2941395	2942015	It's really pretty.
2943056	2945476	I still had one from when I played Blue Burst.
2946476	2946596	Ah.
2947416	2948957	Or I should just say Fantasy Star Online.
2949297	2949497	Right.
2950477	2950597	Hmm.
2952606	2954267	At any rate, there's other stuff.
2956589	2956989	I'm sorry.
2957529	2957869	I'm sorry.
2957889	2958210	You know what?
2958270	2958650	You're right.
2958750	2959290	I screwed up.
2959751	2962993	It's actually you can't use it to do any of that other stuff.
2963013	2965434	You can only use the keyboard for the message board messages.
2966035	2966475	I screwed up.
2966535	2968576	That was a can't on the Internet channel.
2969177	2970377	My bad.
2970718	2972479	Well, that's what I get for not testing it myself.
2973399	2975321	I'm just not kind of interested in that.
2975341	2981044	I'm like, why would I use the Wii to surf the Internet when I have a computer five steps away that can do it?
2981244	2982005	I just don't get it.
2983126	2986067	Some people, I guess, want everything to do everything.
2986307	2989788	I like having one thing that does one thing and another thing that does another thing.
2990768	3005192	Well, anyway, for anyone who has actually been keeping up with Super Mario Galaxy, there has been a few screenshots put in Famitsu showing that there is a desert world and a haunted house.
3005852	3007953	So we get our buddy Boo coming back.
3008373	3010974	A desert world and a haunted house in a Mario game?
3011014	3012294	That's completely new!
3013178	3017641	I don't know.
3017801	3021403	I lost interest in Mario Sunshine about halfway through it.
3023584	3026626	But Super Mario Galaxy will be coming out later this year.
3027727	3033350	And I want it to actually keep my attention.
3035552	3035912	Awesome.
3037424	3039506	Now, some other interesting stuff coming out.
3039586	3053795	There was a patent found online for a motion sensing portable, or at least something for a portable system to sense directional movements on all different axes.
3054055	3059619	Basically, a six-axis built into a Game Boy Advance type thing.
3060239	3065402	So, maybe something in the future to be added to...
3066889	3092482	The DS, new handheld console, who knows If I were to guess, I would say that maybe something to plug into the Game Boy Advance Or actually the DS, the Game Boy Advance slot To use that actually as a controller for different games Because the DS, it can connect to the Wii So might as well add some tilt sensing to it as well
3095454	3097596	God, I hope they're not putting out another portable system.
3098036	3098636	Oh, they will.
3099197	3101298	And they'll call the Game Boy something else.
3101338	3103920	And they'll be like, ha, you get to buy it again, bitch.
3104140	3107503	Part of me kind of hopes that they're doing this so that nobody else will.
3107883	3115248	Like, maybe they're doing one of those, like, what is it, the company that keeps filing the patents on the... Immersion?
3115488	3121252	Yeah, like they're doing one of those type of patents where they're just doing it before anyone else can think of it because of the success of the Wii.
3121372	3121752	I don't know.
3123754	3124334	I just hope not.
3126482	3126822	We'll see.
3128143	3141130	Meanwhile, for the Nintendo consoles, as we mentioned earlier, Metroid and Super Metroid have been confirmed that they are on their way to the virtual console a little later this month, leading up to, of course, the release of Metroid Prime 3.
3142131	3149915	All this can be found in the new Metroid Prime 3 preview channel, which you can download for the Wii, which I tried to do, but it wouldn't work.
3149975	3152756	I got like three download arrows in a row, so I was like, forget it.
3152796	3155438	Did you check out the Metroid Prime 3 preview channel?
3155882	3158423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3186147	3186547	Interesting.
3187067	3190668	Drew Nami says, it's cool, but it's YouTube, basically.
3192149	3198011	Well, you can't get an accurate portrayal of what the game looks like with something like YouTube graphics.
3198171	3205573	I can't wait for someone to modify that channel because I'm sure that whatever it's streaming is probably off the internet and not on your console.
3206093	3215836	So that would be pretty cool to change the DNS in it or something to stream video off of other things so you could actually turn it into not really YouTube, but I don't know.
3216564	3219245	DarkSakura, tell the kids where they should be pointing their web browsers this week.
3247259	3253722	Today's website of the week is really a result of wishful thinking on my part.
3254282	3256863	But it's ferretsunlimited.org.
3257203	3261685	It's basically a shelter for ferrets.
3262026	3263486	They have adoption services.
3263946	3265427	They're actually in Ohio.
3266107	3271210	But the good thing about this site is it also has information about needs.
3271350	3274211	It has links to other shelters, how to shop.
3276298	3280180	How to take care of your ferret and a bunch of links.
3280821	3285783	I'm working on trying to eventually have a ferret baby myself.
3286324	3288525	Even though they're still illegal to own in California, aren't they?
3288545	3290046	Not if somebody brings them from out of state.
3291507	3294929	You're going to smuggle in a ferret in California?
3294949	3296530	I'm going to smuggle in a ferret, hell yeah.
3297025	3298606	You probably wouldn't be the first one to do it, I'm sure.
3298626	3298907	Well, no.
3299267	3309355	And on top of that, there's a few other sites out there on the internet that tell you where in California has a list of vets who will take care of your ferrets and not turn you in.
3310596	3310876	Hmm.
3311957	3312958	So, I think that's pretty cool.
3312978	3318843	Or even better, that they still sell the crap for ferrets at, like, the store, but... Oh, yeah.
3318883	3322085	You know, even though they're not allowed over here.
3322125	3323787	Ferrets are the best pets ever.
3324687	3326829	As much as I love my cat, I really want a ferret.
3328106	3331127	All right, well, what's going to happen when you have a cat and a ferret?
3331367	3332547	Are they going to chase each other around the house?
3332808	3336549	Actually, well, I'd love for Shermie to get chased around the house, that big fat animal.
3337529	3343551	Okay, my cat is intensely obese, and she's lazy, and I can't even chase her around the house.
3343951	3345111	She's like, oh, it's just mom.
3345131	3347012	She'll just step on me, and then I'll be okay.
3348092	3353954	Dar Tetsuya says in chat room, chat.orangemonstrator.com, Rob Roberts reminding you to help control the ferret population.
3353994	3355135	Have your ferret spayed or neutered.
3355415	3355675	Yes.
3356355	3358336	and RossDLUT asks a good question.
3358717	3360858	I actually don't know the answer to it, but I'm assuming you do, DarkSakura.
3360898	3362739	Why the fuck are ferrets illegal in California?
3363760	3366962	That's... Okay, I don't know the entire thing.
3367582	3370784	I actually haven't seen anything legitimate about it.
3371725	3379250	But they're talking about some problem with certain breeds of them being endangered and with having this...
3380249	3382470	Wild Ferret Population from Strays.
3382530	3383771	I was like, that's stupid.
3384151	3384812	I'll tell you why.
3385112	3387053	It's because of Beastmaster.
3387833	3395337	Because they don't want another one of those crappy movies made in California, so... No ferrets, no Beastmaster sequel.
3396138	3396678	You know what?
3397218	3400320	My friend... Before I moved out here, my friend was... At least not another sequel.
3400940	3406123	My friend was going to give me his ferrets, and their names were Koto and Poto.
3407074	3410477	Okay, I'm on Wikipedia, of course, to find the answer to this question.
3410617	3412138	Oh, I'm on ferretnews.org.
3412198	3433855	And in the ferret article, it cites this reference, the Fish and Game Code of California, and what it says, quote, animals of the families Vivuridae, I'm sorry, I'm totally mispronouncing these, and Mustelidae, which I'm assuming the ferrets belong to, in the order Carnivora are restricted because such animals are undesirable and a menace to native wildlife, the agricultural interest of the state...
3435476	3436957	or to the public health or safety.
3466328	3474190	Yeah, but then you're going to get those stupid people that let the ferrets run loose outdoors like a fucking cat and it's going to kill things and screw up the ecosystem.
3474230	3475951	A cat can take a ferret.
3476231	3479171	I didn't know that ferrets shouldn't be outside.
3479632	3481192	I'm totally oblivious to that.
3481392	3484033	And then, you know, they ruin it for everybody.
3485853	3487994	I don't know why we're talking about ferrets on a video game show.
3488154	3489554	That's Orange Lounge.
3489594	3490595	We have ferrets, okay?
3491535	3491915	A ferret.
3491935	3493755	The ferret's in the box somewhere right now.
3494316	3495656	We don't have a ferret in the studio yet.
3496604	3500725	But no, I really, really, really, really want a ferret.
3501045	3506007	So I'm working on trying to get my significant other to agree.
3506307	3508668	Alright, I really, really want to get back into gaming news.
3509648	3513049	Just to answer, son of dad ferrets live anywhere between 10 to 15 years.
3515870	3516270	Alright.
3517511	3518631	Anyways, so...
3519381	3520742	Interesting stuff.
3521242	3523684	Actually, I guess a decent game for the iPod.
3523804	3524484	Hold on, wait a minute.
3524824	3527306	TigerClaw in chat has a great point.
3527966	3529447	There's no ferret video games.
3529987	3530387	Like, ever.
3530507	3531468	Let's fix that!
3531548	3533329	Has there ever been a ferret video game?
3533609	3533729	Ever?
3533849	3534029	No.
3534130	3536651	In existence, has a ferret even been a character in a video game?
3537491	3538052	Beastmaster.
3538172	3539813	I cannot... Besides Beastmaster...
3541005	3545008	I can't think of anything where a... This is a travesty!
3545488	3546729	2DX16, Ferret.
3546829	3547129	No!
3548150	3553053	We need to have a game... Okay, now that's... 2DX Troopers, that's bullshit.
3553093	3556996	Let's put that up on the Orange Lounge Radio Xbox Live Arcade wish list.
3557036	3561098	Okay, we have Laser Cats, the game, and now we have Ferret, the video game.
3561559	3561959	What, Loki?
3563148	3568073	Actually, there has been a ferret video game for the Game Boy Color created by Culture Brain.
3568554	3574640	It's called Ferret Monogatari Watashi no Okini Iri.
3575380	3575881	Big what?
3576201	3579604	Anyways, Ferret Story, My Dear Ferret.
3579745	3585170	It's a Japanese-only video game that's a simulation-style game where you take care of a ferret.
3585869	3588191	At the start of the game, choose one of three different colored ferrets.
3588211	3589632	Colors are randomly chosen.
3589772	3596097	The ferret is kept in the cage a bunch of the time, but you have to keep his water and food topped off and clean its litter box.
3596137	3598819	You can take the ferret out for walks or to play with it.
3599349	3601229	You can also even play minigames.
3601369	3604310	One is a race, one is putting together a picture, and the other is dancing.
3604510	3605430	It's Nintendogs.
3605590	3609451	Yeah, and just like Nintendogs, the game gets fucking boring after playing it for an hour.
3609631	3610931	I'm getting the ferret game.
3611131	3611691	You watch.
3611772	3612132	Hold on.
3612172	3614212	We got a lot of comments in chat here on the ferret game.
3614932	3617733	SSJ100Matt says, There's a ferret-like creature in Pokemon.
3618613	3619273	Not really a ferret.
3619733	3624154	TheRobD says, Was there a ferret in Bible Adventures or in Super 3D Noah's Ark?
3624534	3626314	Probably not because ferrets are unclean.
3626334	3627315	They're not God's animals.
3627915	3628135	So...
3630015	3631176	They weren't allowed on the Ark.
3631716	3632316	Like lice.
3632517	3634237	I don't think Noah took lice on the Ark.
3634257	3634517	That's okay.
3634537	3635398	The lice were in their hair.
3637179	3638979	They didn't have rid back in the day.
3639220	3639920	Exactly.
3640440	3641220	You know what?
3641240	3642261	He's a bastard anyway.
3642361	3643101	I didn't vote for him.
3643141	3644002	I voted for Gary Coleman.
3654902	3656763	I voted for Mary Carey.
3657283	3660764	Bandit says there was a ferret in a video game called Penguin Wars for the Game Boy.
3661824	3663844	Why would a ferret be in a penguin game?
3665165	3666005	I don't know.
3667685	3667965	All right.
3668065	3668706	Sorry, Loki.
3669746	3671606	Please put the show back on track if you can.
3671866	3675127	There's this news website that has a character that they talk about.
3675207	3676507	Well, a video game news site.
3676607	3678088	It's called Toothpick the Ferret.
3678908	3680228	He has a giant cloud sword.
3680528	3682829	Anyways, so yeah.
3683755	3684857	Music Cuts, Parappa the Rapper
3692554	3720370	and it's a game that's basically a musical music visualizer game more background I guess than anything and I guess when the game creates visuals based on the titles of your songs and then asks players to tap the center button in time with each letter of the name and you get points for doing that and build up your combo yada yada yada so if you were interested in buying it it's $4.99 on the iTunes store
3723151	3723992	I might have to check that out.
3742836	3748340	TigerClaw, I hate to go back to the ferret thing, but the chat room just won't shut up about it, which is what I love about having a chat room.
3748840	3753283	HitStun says, Hotaru Fukuba from Garou Mark of the Wolves had a yellow ferret.
3754284	3756966	I found the game online, but it's a Flash game.
3758307	3759127	Let's see what else is there.
3759688	3766892	TigerClaw says, if Nintendo or Sega is listening, they have a potential franchise if they create Sonic the Hedgehog type game starring a ferret.
3767413	3767713	Who knows?
3768464	3769024	Beatmania 2DX
3782762	3788683	Beatmania, now in 2DX, and it's 15th in creation, is now being location tested.
3789004	3791944	It's called DJ Troopers, is the new theme.
3792284	3798186	It's kind of a silly name, but of course, a lot of people thought Red and Happy Sky were dumb names too, so.
3798206	3802467	Happy Sky made sense, at least it was very, you know, English-y.
3802647	3810849	Well, DJ Troopers, I give it a chance, because it's kind of green, like camo colors are kind of green, so that's one color they haven't really done yet, so, I give it a chance.
3811710	3812831	This is the cutest thing ever.
3813712	3819576	Beatmania 2 DX has not really changed a whole lot over the past few games.
3819616	3823278	I mean, little subtle changes here and there, but the game itself hasn't changed a whole lot.
3823318	3829563	Well, it has been location tested, or is going through location tests in Tokyo right now, and some of the songs are sneaking out.
3829583	3834947	There's a new song from Chorus K called Evergreen, a new song from Akira Yamaoka called Shift.
3835667	3837028	It's a techno song, should be fun.
3837728	3840689	Another remix of A is in the game, which should be interesting.
3841489	3844550	New songs, of course, are green colored in the song list.
3845330	3855854	The five keys modifier now uses keys three through seven instead of one through five when playing on the two player side, which is kind of a different type of change there for those that like to play five key mode.
3857254	3859555	And a song called Deep Strikers.
3860117	3867002	has 1,528 notes on Hyper and is a 12 rated song on Double Hyper.
3867082	3868623	That's going to be crazy.
3869163	3870944	They got rid of a bunch of songs, by the way.
3871445	3873006	Bag is finally no longer in 2DX.
3873026	3873126	Yay!
3873146	3874687	So there you go.
3875207	3877769	But also sad, Diamond Jealousy is also gone finally.
3878089	3878249	Boo!
3878269	3878810	That's kind of sad.
3879650	3880171	So there you go.
3880311	3886835	I'm sure we'll be hearing more about this on your favorite music gaming website as the week goes on and more stuff comes out of Location Test.
3887095	3889317	I'm sure YouTubes are coming far behind.
3890063	3894545	Well, I have some happy that I hope would be something that happens.
3895686	3903210	There is actually a hint about there being a downloadable sequel on PSN for Parappa.
3904610	3907152	I would just be so happy to have more Parappa.
3907932	3910193	But right now it's in rumor phase.
3911134	3914996	The creator of Parappa the Rapper just sort of talked about it, not really.
3915016	3916377	He said, oh yeah, let's just do it.
3917437	3919178	Fuck Parappa, I want Umjama Lammy.
3919870	3920750	That would be cool.
3921310	3924131	How come we always hear about Parappa this, Parappa that?
3924391	3930413	Parappa remake, Parappa going to be on the PlayStation Network maybe, but there ain't shit about Umjamalami.
3930433	3931793	We need Umjam or Death Metal.
3933574	3934414	Or what was it?
3934714	3937175	There was Umjamalami and then Rami was her friend, right?
3937275	3937655	Rami.
3937895	3939475	Rami was her opposite.
3939716	3942156	I still think it sucks because I wanted the hell level.
3943397	3944837	Instead they put him on an island.
3946693	3953477	and RustyLUT theorizes maybe it's because Unjamalami sucked, but that would be a lie because Unjamalami was awesome.
3953557	3955338	So I failed to see your logic.
3955378	3955818	I'm sorry.
3956458	3957219	So there you have it.
3958379	3968045	I suppose, though, if the Parappa thing did come out for the PlayStation Network and it sold like crazy, maybe we could convince them to do an Unjamalami song in-game.
3968485	3968705	We'll see.
3969355	3976680	Alright, anyhow, that's going to bring this segment of Orange Lounge Radio to a close, but we will be back with Part B right after a quick break.
3977220	3982204	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
3982644	3986967	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
