0	19760	Is the Xbox 360 Core on its way out?
19760	24640	New details on Super Mario Galaxy, and is it really possible to now play NES games on
24640	26640	your iPhone?
26640	32640	Orange Lounge Radio
32640	36280	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange
36280	37280	Lounge Radio.
37280	41600	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
41600	42760	lifestyle.
42760	47120	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be here with you all night long, as will my lovely co-host,
47120	48880	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
48880	49880	Hi.
49880	51880	And how are you doing, Jamie?
51880	53640	Uh, full of burrito.
53640	54640	Mmm, yummy burrito.
54640	55640	Shrimpy burritos.
55640	57080	Just shrimp?
57080	58080	No red meat tonight?
58080	60680	No, I'm not going to be eating red meat anymore.
60680	63320	Are you going on one of those funky diet things?
63320	65680	Well, out of necessity, I can't.
65680	68400	Every so often, I get to where I can't actually eat it very safely.
68400	69400	Oh.
69400	72040	Because I was going to say, you can't have diet without dye.
72040	73040	I don't diet.
73040	74680	I have lifestyle adjustments.
74680	76240	I see.
76240	77240	That's a clever little work-around.
77240	80600	Alright, also joining us, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
80600	83760	So would a funky diet be like pizza and disco or something?
83760	85600	I mean, would that be a funky diet?
85600	87360	Would that be eating dirty food?
87360	88360	Why?
88360	89360	Is that what your life is like right now?
89360	90360	No.
90360	91360	Disco and pizza?
91360	93480	Yes, everything's all disco and pizza.
93480	96200	Whatever happened to discos?
96200	98640	You know, my mom still calls clubs discos.
98640	99640	The discotheque.
99640	100640	No.
100640	101640	I'm doing okay.
101640	102640	Alright.
102640	103640	Well, I had pizza.
103640	104640	You had pizza?
104640	105640	Yes.
105640	106640	Was it good pizza?
106640	107640	Yes.
107640	108640	So I'm halfway there on the diet.
108640	109640	Alright.
109640	110640	Yeah, fully commit on the funky diet.
110640	115120	Well, I say welcome back because obviously we were off two weeks ago and then last week
115120	119480	was kind of a weird show because we were at Studio Loki, which was a temporary setup.
119480	121500	We are kind of in the new studio now.
121500	124320	We're not out in the garage, which is where we want to be, where we're going to have the
124320	129440	retro gaming setup and the webcam and everything, just because we don't have the air conditioning
129440	131480	yet out there and it's too hot.
131480	135240	So we're in the little studio, but the good news is we're back on the normal computers
135240	140560	and the normal network setup and all that good stuff, so the sound of the show should
140560	143240	be pretty much what you guys are used to, at least I hope.
143240	148160	Save some minor echo and probably things you probably can't even really hear on your iPods.
148160	149720	So we're happy to be back.
149720	151480	And also we're happy to have you back, Jamie.
151480	155360	And I know a lot of folks were thinking about you last week, so I hope everything was okay.
155360	157160	It was interesting.
157160	158160	Alright.
158160	160040	Well, we'll leave it at that.
160040	163880	Let's talk about games instead and talk about your interesting experience at California
163880	164880	Extreme.
164880	165880	You just got back from yesterday.
165880	166880	Yes.
166880	167880	At two in the morning.
167880	168880	Oh my God.
168880	171600	What exactly is California Extreme?
171600	175000	It's a pinball and classic gaming convention of sorts.
175000	179960	They had an auction there, but as far as I know, it wasn't actually part of California
179960	180960	Extreme.
180960	184880	But I did play a whole crap ton of games and finally beat Space Harrier.
184880	187880	I saw your LJ post about beating Space Harrier.
187880	189520	I sure did.
189520	190720	It was fantastic.
190720	194000	I forgot that it just says the end.
194000	197720	So they just get a bunch of random games together and call it an expo?
197720	199240	Yeah, some of them are for sale.
199240	200240	Oh, okay.
200240	201240	Well, that's pretty cool.
201240	205760	Big Bang Bar, which was the first thing I went right to, I ran into, well, actually
205760	213040	I met up with Mel and Melody and the first thing that she and I did was go right up and
213040	220160	play Big Bang Bar, which was one of the last machines Capcom made.
220160	225760	But they only had about 16 prototypes and now there's production models of them.
225760	227920	Well, I should say reproduction models.
227920	236060	But the one that we played was a legitimate prototype and then it was just mostly wandering
236060	237680	around and she was playing Star Wars.
237680	242760	I got to play Ultra Pin, which was kind of interesting.
242760	245080	It's Ultra Cade's answer to pinball.
245080	247720	Oh, I think you talked about this on the show once.
247720	250160	Isn't it like they used an LCD but laid flat instead?
250160	251160	Yeah.
251160	252160	How does that work?
252160	253160	Is it good?
253160	254160	It was interesting.
254160	256120	The perspective kind of messed with my head a little bit.
256120	260160	I played Black Knight 2000 on it, which was pretty cool.
260160	263480	And then I was like, screw this, I went to play a real Black Knight 2000.
263480	265800	I was like, woohoo, Black Knight.
265800	270160	Now, did they bring any developers to this show or is there anybody like, you know, game
270160	271160	famous or whatever?
271160	272160	Or is it just...
272160	275560	I didn't go to any of the panels because I was like, dude, pinball.
275560	276560	So they do have live panels and some things.
276560	279560	They did not have a pinbot, Rob.
279560	280560	Or a jackpot.
280560	281560	Cry and Sadness.
281560	282560	Do they have Bride of...
282560	283560	Well, you have Bride of Pinbot in your house.
283560	284560	I have Bride.
284560	285560	No, they didn't have that.
285560	286760	You're so badass, by the way.
286760	289400	I played Vortex, which is one of the mid-80s.
289400	291400	Oh, I remember Vortex.
291400	292400	That's a cool one.
292400	294400	But I played one of the best tables ever.
294400	295400	It's called Airborne.
295400	297560	It's one of Capcom's.
297560	298560	It's all ramps.
298560	300120	It's all ramps.
300120	304160	It's just a bajillion ramps everywhere and it was fun and they had it on like a bajillion
304160	305160	buy-ins.
305160	306700	It was crazy.
306700	309880	So did you play anything besides Space Harrier and pinball?
309880	310880	Words.
310880	313800	Yes, I did.
313800	315180	I didn't play Journey.
315180	316180	They got Journey working.
316180	317180	They had Journey?
317180	318180	Yes.
318180	319180	Oh my god, I should have gone.
319180	322200	I was trying to go but I couldn't because I had other stuff going on.
322200	323200	What else did I play?
323200	325320	Oh, what I would give to play a Journey arcade machine.
325320	326320	I played Mappy.
326320	327320	Huh.
327320	328320	I played...
328320	330860	Well, Julie played a bunch of Crystal Castles.
330860	335760	Every time I ran into her, she's either playing Crystal Castles or Pac-Man.
335760	341720	They had a Tapper, Rob, that someone had messed with the sprites and it was all Simpsons characters.
341720	342720	Well, that's weird.
342720	345720	And Mo was the bartender.
345720	347440	That's pretty cool.
347440	354960	And they had, I played SVC Chaos because I had to get my fighting game on and I played
354960	358720	some X-Men vs. Street Fighter so I could use the most annoying team ever.
358720	362560	See, Dan and I, when we first got together, we played a whole crap ton of that game on
362560	367280	Saturn and I used to always have this one combo that would just piss him off and annoy
367280	370540	him so much that he would just quit.
370540	373480	And that was Cammy and Gambit.
373480	377760	Note to everybody, if ever you play against my husband, Cammy and Gambit, he will get
377760	378760	mad.
378760	379760	So, anyway.
379760	384160	I played a few other things, though.
384160	387120	I played some Dig Dug.
387120	388680	I had Dig Dug.
388680	389680	That was cool.
389680	390680	They had a sit-down Star Wars.
390680	393880	They had an Empire Strikes Back arcade machine, which was really cool.
393880	395480	They had Discs of Tron.
395480	396480	Rad.
396480	398880	They had Tron.
398880	399960	Not a lot of new stuff, though.
399960	400960	It's all retro stuff.
400960	401960	Oh, yeah.
401960	402960	It's all retro.
402960	403960	I remember there was one year...
403960	404960	Oh!
404960	405960	They had Panic Park.
405960	406960	What the hell is that?
406960	407960	I've never heard of that.
407960	408960	Panic Park is this great game.
408960	412520	I think they have one at Milpitas Golf Land where there's a big one and then there's a
412520	413520	small one.
413520	416520	They had an actual Japanese one there, but they had the bad Engrish-y one.
416520	419920	It's a game where you have these... one person's on one side and the other person's on another.
419920	424920	You have to play with another person and you have a big stick and it slides around.
424920	430340	You are competing with somebody in mini-games and it's best however many out of however
430340	435120	many and you push them aside or they push you aside using this big stick when you're
435120	438680	like grabbing hula hoops as they come from the ground or grabbing coins or jumping from
438680	440440	thing to thing or avoiding hammers falling on you.
440440	442040	I have never heard of this.
442040	443680	It's fantastic.
443680	448800	And I've actually played with Dan's buddy, Will, and Will is really strong, okay?
448800	450320	So I had a hard time.
450320	456520	We ended up... he won two matches, I won two matches, and we had a draw of three matches
456520	459080	so we actually had a perfect draw game.
459080	463120	I gotta read some comments from chat because your comments on old gaming is sparking a
463120	466200	lot of discussion in chat and of course since I haven't introduced them yet, say hello to
466200	471040	our chat room at chat.orangelaunchradio.com and let's see, we have GS68 says, I was at
471040	474520	Milpitas Golf Land on Thursday, I don't remember seeing a game like that so maybe it wasn't
474520	475520	there.
475520	476520	Maybe it was at Sunnyvale or something.
476520	479200	Kevin DDR says, Oh my God, Panic Park, hell yeah.
479200	481160	So somebody knows what you're talking about there.
481160	485680	Sakura Max says, He's confused, he's the youngest guy so he doesn't know about these old ass
485680	486680	games.
486680	487680	Well, it's time to learn.
487680	489040	It's time to step up and learn.
489040	494080	Dude, just, okay, whenever you go to an arcade, all you have to do is just look around and
494080	495080	look for the older stuff.
495080	496080	Oh, they had...
496080	497080	Look for the games that still only cost one token.
497080	498080	They had cocktail machines.
498080	499520	Tons of cocktail tables.
499520	502720	And they were playing music videos and they freaking played Warrant.
502720	505380	It was great.
505380	508840	You know, the other thing I was going to say is that Xbox Live Arcade is slowly getting
508840	510200	a lot of these classic games on it.
510200	512800	I mean, you know that Tron and Distro-Tron are coming out for it.
512800	515480	Dig Dug, which you mentioned, is already on Xbox Live Arcade.
515480	517680	There are a lot of classics that are on there.
517680	520400	Sakura Max asks if GameTap would help them or not.
520400	521400	Probably.
521400	522400	Probably.
522400	525320	I mean, they certainly have a collection of old stuff on there, although I've been called
525320	529080	a GameTap whore too much on this program so I don't want to sound like an advertisement.
529080	533240	They also, though, had some of the little bar top machines.
533240	534580	Oh, cool.
534580	536200	Like the little, like, what do they call it?
536200	537200	Mega Touch and that stuff?
537200	541880	Yeah, but they were actually the ones with the controllers and everything on them.
541880	552000	And they had an actual Pong and they had the small child-sized machines, the SNK machines.
552000	553000	Cool.
553000	558380	The Neo Geo one, sorry, with, like, you know, Puzzle Bobble.
558380	561360	So it sounds like you had a lot of fun and it sounds like I really missed out getting
561360	562360	to see Journey Machine.
562360	565760	I did get to find, though, some of my favorite old tables were there, though, like Centaur.
565760	568720	They had a Hyperball, which I refused to ever play again.
568720	570720	Stupid fucking Hyperball.
570720	576000	And they had, um, I'm sorry, I'm trying to watch my language.
576000	578000	That's all right.
578000	580280	Watch it fly out of your mouth and offend people.
580280	581280	Bye.
581280	582280	There you go, language, have fun.
582280	585680	So did you play any, like, new games this week or was it all pretty much retro gaming
585680	586680	goodness?
586680	590560	Um, I played the Ultra Pin.
590560	592800	All right.
592800	594120	That's technically new.
594120	603880	I played DDR, I played Max 2.
603880	605040	That is kind of old school as well.
605040	606880	I played Cowgirl in flip flops.
606880	607880	All right.
607880	613480	It was fun, it was actually kind of funny, I was like, dude, I am going to fall over
613480	614480	and I didn't.
614480	615480	It was great.
615480	617720	All right, well, next year the dude with the Journey Machine needs to come back to California
617720	620520	Extreme so I can play it, or I'll be sad.
620520	625360	But my World Cup soccer is almost, um, fixed up nice.
625360	626360	Oh!
626360	630920	This is what pisses me off, it's not really an F-you, it's just a, huh?
630920	636680	The one Theater of Magic they had, and the entire place was at the tournament area.
636680	640000	Unless you pay to do the stupid tournament and you can't play the Theater of Magic, I'm
640000	641000	like, uh-huh!
641000	642000	Theater of Magic!
642000	643000	Theater of Magic's a pretty bad-ass revelation.
643000	645000	I did play the Devil's Madness, though.
645000	647040	I knocked down the castle, it was great.
647040	650160	All right, we've got to move on, but it sounds like you've got a lot of good gaming in, even
650160	652120	if most of it was pinball, not console games.
652120	653120	Pinball!
653120	654120	Pinball's pretty rad.
654120	655120	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
655120	656760	Um, it was okay.
656760	659360	Before I get into my gaming week, though, I wanted to talk about, there was this game
659360	661680	that I saw that was coming out later.
661680	667400	Now, you know, I dogged Neo Geo, or not Neo Geo, SNK for Never coming up with new games.
667400	670920	This actually sounds pretty cool, and I think we talked about it a little bit before, Neo
670920	672480	Geo Battle Colosseum.
672480	678840	It's a fighting game that features, like, an ensemble cast of all the past Neo Geo games,
678840	684280	including King of Fighters, Fatal Fury, Mark of the Wolves, Samurai Shodown, Art of Fighting,
684280	691400	Last Blade, King of the Monsters, World Heroes, Athena, Aggressors of Dark Combat, Kizuna,
691400	692960	Tag Battle, and Metal Slug.
692960	695760	Dude, you said Last Blade, and that makes me happy.
695760	700680	Wait, so you could have, like, my fighting one of the monsters from King of Monsters?
700680	706280	And if I remember correctly, this isn't being published every year by SNK, but it is coming
706280	710920	out in October, and I think it's cheap, and it's on PlayStation 2, so that seemed pretty
710920	711920	cool.
711920	713920	Anyways, I just thought that was neat.
713920	717440	Now, actually, the games that I played this week, I played the demo for Stranglehold,
717440	718600	which was actually pretty fun.
718600	722200	It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be, with a lot of running around,
722200	726240	flying through the air, shooting things in slow-mo, so that's pretty cool.
726240	731080	And then I also tried the Fatal Inertia demo, which, you know, I've been really hyped up
731080	736320	about the game ever since they first announced it, because they reminded me of, like, you
736320	741760	know, kind of like F-Zero GX or something like that, you know, a combat racing game.
741760	743160	That was not the case with this.
743160	744820	This is crap.
744820	748200	And I, thank God I played the demo, because I'm not buying the game now.
748200	752440	It's just, it's hard to control, and it didn't seem that fast, and, I don't know, I just
752440	756860	didn't like the level layout, it wasn't pretty enough for me, so, oh well.
756860	764900	And then, let's see, I also played 300 on the PSP, because I had just watched the Blu-ray
764900	769720	for it, so, that game sucks also.
769720	770720	But what do you expect?
770720	771720	Why?
771720	772720	It's just a hack and slash game.
772720	773720	It's like a movie tie-in game.
773720	775800	Well, that's not what the movie was?
775800	776800	I don't know, I didn't see the movie, so.
776800	778440	Yeah, well the movie was a lot better than that, so.
778440	781660	I'm the one guy that didn't see 300.
781660	787760	And then, I've been playing, actually, strangely enough, well, Overlord have been playing,
787760	790640	and that game's still really fun.
790640	797280	I've also been playing, this is going to be really weird, Cellars of Catan, actually.
797280	803160	And because I got hooked on this yesterday, actually, I was playing the actual board game
803160	806720	with my sister and her boyfriend, and it's really fun.
806720	810320	So I bought the Xbox Live Arcade game, and it's pretty much the same thing, except the
810320	815440	AI's completely cheap, but other than that, the only thing I really wish it had was local
815440	818640	multiplayer instead of just over live.
818640	821440	That would be pretty cool, but, you know, they didn't, so.
821440	823400	But this game has passed the wife test, right?
823400	826400	Oh yeah, the wife is probably playing it right now, actually.
826400	827400	That's amazing.
827400	829520	Yeah, she was playing it all afternoon, so.
829520	831440	Does she have her own gamertag?
831440	834720	So like, you could use my Xbox 360 over here and then play your wife.
834720	839440	No, she's still playing, she's playing under my gamertag right now, so.
839440	842840	Yeah, I think that's pretty much all I've been playing, you know, Grand Theft Auto by
842840	848560	City Stories, of course, and still very disappointed about Grand Theft Auto IV not coming out until
848560	849560	next year.
849560	851560	Grand Theft Auto IV still played the PSP version for a long time.
851560	852560	Cry me a river.
852560	853560	Cry me a river.
853560	857840	Alright, somebody in chat earlier, and I apologize, I forgot who said it, somebody had said, what's
857840	861880	more funny than watching Grand Theft Auto IV get delayed is watching everything else
861880	865700	back out of its way now that it's been delayed, everything else is getting delayed because
865700	866700	of that.
866700	869280	There's other games that have all kind of moved out of, like the ripple effect that
869280	870840	Grand Theft Auto is having.
870840	872720	Kind of interesting.
872720	877800	Looking at the chat room and talking about some quotes there.
877800	879520	What is it that Rob D. said that was really funny?
879520	883800	Oh, about the Battle Coliseum game and how I said Mai could fight one of the King of
883800	884800	the Monsters.
884800	888940	Sky just wants to see Mai versus a tentacle monster, let's face it, that quote coming
888940	894960	from the Rob D. Let's see, apparently the Rob D. didn't see 300 either, so I guess I'm
894960	896720	not the only one ever.
896720	901680	Let's see, what else is there?
901680	906200	Ross Deal UT impersonates Loki, duh, I'm going to play this movie game, maybe it'll suck
906200	908680	less than all the others.
908680	912480	I suppose saying that all movie games usually suck.
912480	913480	One thing that's usually a pretty common thing.
913480	917200	For the most part they do, I mean there's some movie games that are okay.
917200	920680	I remember like some of the NES Batman games weren't that bad.
920680	923080	Oh yeah, that's true.
923080	925980	And I actually liked the Friday the 13th game.
925980	930240	It always ends up on these worst NES games of all times list, but that game actually
930240	934120	scared me when I was a kid, because it was kind of a scary game, I don't know, anyway.
934120	937160	But yeah, movie games usually not so much fun.
937160	939760	Let's see, games I've been playing this week.
939760	942880	Not a lot of new stuff unfortunately, I've been on World of Warcraft, I'm really grinding
942880	946200	like hell in World of Warcraft to try and get my character to level 70, so I'll be all
946200	951200	ready by the time the next expansion comes out, and also the fact is that I know all
951200	954160	these console games are coming out very soon, like especially when we get into the end of
954160	959840	August, Blue Dragon, Eternal Sonata, Halo, and then Metro Prime 3 and all these games
959840	963220	I'm going to want to be playing are all coming out soon, so I want to get as much grinding
963220	966220	in as I can before I get distracted by the console games.
966220	970040	So most of my week has been spent on the PC playing WoW, otherwise though I have been
970040	975240	playing some other console games, I was playing Kingdom Hearts 2 more, and I finally surpassed
975240	977920	my first save game, so I guess that's kind of cool.
977920	983040	Otherwise I checked out, because I was without internet for a little while, because if you
983040	986800	listen to last week's show, Comcast finally didn't come out here until Tuesday, and by
986800	990720	the way, let me say, Comcast said they were going to come in here in a window between
990720	993160	12 and 4, you know what time they finally got here?
993160	996200	7.30, 8 o'clock, it's horrible.
996200	999480	Then I would, don't you get some money or something off your bill?
999480	1001480	We got a $20 credit.
1001480	1002480	Whoopee!
1002480	1003480	Whoopee-doo!
1003480	1004480	Whoopee-doo!
1004480	1007880	Then they installed all this shit we didn't ask for, like all the HBO and Showtime shit,
1007880	1009360	and channels, we didn't want that shit.
1009360	1012400	I mean it was cool for one night, because I got to watch Big Brother After Dark, which
1012400	1016500	is kind of cheesy fun, but yeah, we had to get rid of that, like they just totally screwed
1016500	1017500	up the order.
1017500	1022280	I'm actually surprised they remembered to put the HD in there, it's bad.
1022280	1026440	So yeah, otherwise my gaming week has been pretty light in that regard, just mostly World
1026440	1031720	of Warcraft, but I will be kicking back into high gear when we get into the end of the
1031720	1032720	month.
1032720	1035680	Oh, the Xbox Live Arcade games, I did catch up on all those ones I missed while I was
1035680	1036680	out.
1036680	1037880	I didn't care for any of them.
1037880	1042360	Like I just, I played like four, I didn't like the Spyglass board games, I didn't like
1042360	1048080	Super, well Super Contra was okay, I mean, you know, and Track and Field is okay, surprisingly,
1048080	1050400	I actually think I played Track and Field more than any of the other ones.
1050400	1054760	I was thinking about buying Track and Field, it just looks stupid, like it's just back
1054760	1058000	and forth with the analog sick, isn't it?
1058000	1062360	Well that, or you can use the buttons, because the actual arcade machine used buttons, like
1062360	1063640	giant pop and music.
1063640	1067600	Or you know what I suggest doing, since I think, aren't the controls completely configurable
1067600	1069000	and stuff like that?
1069000	1074400	DDR pads, man, get out the DDR pads and bust it out like Track and Field, yeah.
1074400	1075400	Maybe.
1075400	1079040	I don't know, it's not the most thrilling game ever, but for some reason I like those
1079040	1082560	old retro games, so it's fun to me.
1082560	1085520	But I don't know if I'd actually recommend it to a lot of people, because it's certainly
1085520	1089880	not one of the better Konami arcade ports that's on Marketplace.
1089880	1095240	Anyway, let's move on and get into some housekeeping so we can get to tonight's news.
1095240	1098840	First off in the housekeeping tonight, podcast award voting is closed, so you can no longer
1098840	1102960	vote for us, but we appreciate anybody that voted for us, we won't know the results till
1102960	1108440	later and, I don't know, we probably won't win, and it's okay if we don't, you know,
1108440	1109440	whatever.
1109440	1110440	It was nice to be nominated.
1110440	1111440	Exactly.
1111440	1113120	Because especially after last year when we weren't nominated, we were like, did we do
1113120	1114120	something wrong?
1114120	1116120	But it was cool, so.
1116120	1119280	Why don't they call us in the morning?
1119280	1121840	Why don't you call me anymore?
1121840	1125280	But yeah, they nominated like ten shows this year, which is great, but that's a lot of
1125280	1128560	competition, so I wouldn't expect that we win, but if we do, awesome.
1128560	1133200	But moving on, we are featured on Joystiq's podcast rodeo this week, which was kind of
1133200	1138060	hilarious because, you know, we've been doing this show for, you know, years and years,
1138060	1143500	and they highlighted us this week as kind of like, they were mentioning all the podcasts
1143500	1147240	they had that week, and they had themselves, because Joystiq does their own podcast, but
1147240	1150960	they're a little bit irregular, but I guess they did two weeks in a row, so they were
1150960	1154400	nominating themselves for having done two weeks in a row, like saying hooray for us,
1154400	1157520	and then they followed up with us and saying, well, now we have these guys who've been doing
1157520	1158520	it for years and years.
1158520	1159840	So that was just kind of funny.
1159840	1163480	So we appreciate the plug, but it's hilarious that it happened the week that our show was
1163480	1167380	like totally broken, and like Jamie wasn't even here, and then we had all the sound issues
1167380	1168380	we had last week.
1168380	1169380	It was just nuts.
1169380	1173900	And what the listeners couldn't see last week is I was also trying to read stories while
1173900	1178040	keeping the spaghetti away from my cat, because I had a plate of spaghetti, and she kept trying
1178040	1179800	to attack the plate.
1179800	1184560	The sound was so horrible last week, and then for some reason, there was like little packet
1184560	1190200	losses throughout the file, so like suddenly you'd be, and then the words would drop out.
1190200	1191200	It was bad.
1191200	1192600	Because my computer sucks.
1192600	1197440	Luckily, it didn't just reset on us all of a sudden, because it's been doing that lately.
1197440	1200760	I have to replace the motherboard, something's going out on it, so.
1200760	1202840	It was better than nothing at all, though, right?
1202840	1208680	It's an old PC, it needs to be upgraded anyway, so, no, we'll not get an iMac.
1208680	1212480	We went to the Apple store yesterday, oh my God, I felt, I almost felt like I was going
1212480	1216880	to burst into flames, you know.
1216880	1220840	You know, we almost had a webcam tonight, but I just didn't get it set up in time.
1220840	1225160	But you, speaking of Apple, my little Apple webcam and the laptop, so I can have it wherever,
1225160	1227720	but we're going to wait until we move out to the garage to do that, so it'll be fun.
1227720	1230000	You know who else likes that seller is a catan?
1230000	1231000	What's that?
1231000	1235960	She'll sit there in front of the TV and watch the dice move and the cards move and stuff.
1235960	1238040	Just completely fascinated by it.
1238040	1239040	It's awesome.
1239040	1243380	Alright, let's get into some gaming news for tonight, so we can make fun of what's going
1243380	1244600	on in the gaming industry right now.
1244600	1248520	We're not going to make fun, we're going to talk about it in intelligent discussion.
1248520	1249520	Sure.
1249520	1255080	Okay, so there's a rumor going around that Target, among other stores, are going to be
1255080	1258880	discontinuing the Xbox 360 core model.
1258880	1265380	Now, as I mentioned in the last week, I kind of theorized that this might be happening,
1265380	1268560	although I don't think it's any time soon that it's going to happen.
1268560	1272680	But the theory behind it is, other than the fact that it is showing discontinuity in their
1272680	1278720	system, is that they're replacing all of the current premium systems out there with the
1278720	1282480	ones with HDMI, but they're not doing that with the core system.
1282480	1286280	So people are thinking, okay, well they're going to just sell out the core system and
1286280	1288400	then discontinue it.
1288400	1290580	I don't know.
1290580	1293180	Did Microsoft maybe do something to Target?
1293180	1296520	Because I noticed Target, also, aren't they phasing out HD DVDs?
1296520	1298200	Like I seem to remember that was a previous report.
1298200	1299640	I think it was Target that was doing that.
1299640	1303720	Well, they're phasing them out of their store, but if you've ever gone into Target looking
1303720	1310280	for HD product anyways, their shelving that they have is literally maybe 12 movies that
1310280	1311280	they have there.
1311280	1312960	Blu-ray and HD DVD combined.
1312960	1318720	Yeah, I wouldn't exactly consider Target my number one stop for HD DVD purchasing.
1318720	1319720	It's only in store.
1319720	1321000	I think they have them still on the website.
1321000	1326280	It's a little disheartening, though, to see HD DVDs be phased out when I spent as much
1326280	1329320	money as I did on the HD player for the 360.
1329320	1331320	It's all numbers.
1331320	1337240	If their Blu-ray product is selling and their HD is not, then it's better for them to stock
1337240	1340500	more Blu-ray product than HD.
1340500	1344240	Of course, then again, my purchase will be completely justified once Heroes season one
1344240	1346160	comes out on HD DVD, so I don't mind.
1346160	1349280	Because that's when I finally bought the HD DVD player when I heard Heroes was coming
1349280	1350280	out on HD DVD.
1350280	1351280	I was like, oh, gotta have it.
1351280	1352280	So, we'll see.
1352280	1356040	And then, hopefully, with season two or something, they'll do it where you can download the episodes
1356040	1357220	right after they air.
1357220	1359040	That would be awesome.
1359040	1365240	Well, Target isn't the only place that's phasing out the Xbox 360 core model according to some
1365240	1366840	rumors out there right now.
1366840	1370720	And the other store that is phasing them out, Best Buy.
1370720	1374680	Best Buy, as apparently a little screenshot has come out of their system, has shown that
1374680	1382040	the status of the Xbox 360 core hardware in their system was deleted on July 29, 2007.
1382040	1388720	So Microsoft denies that there's any type of core production being stocked.
1388720	1392480	Microsoft says nothing has really changed since the way things were a couple weeks ago,
1392480	1395960	but it's very interesting that now two stores in a row have kind of come out saying they're
1395960	1397240	not going to do these cores anymore.
1397240	1403600	Well, if you remember with the 28 system, and this also could be a numbers thing, before
1403600	1409200	with the 28 system, stores were just not carrying them because people weren't buying them.
1409200	1414040	So now, maybe people aren't really buying the core model anymore and they want to save
1414040	1418780	inventory space or make room on the shelves for more premium systems, more elites and
1418780	1419780	stuff like that.
1419780	1424480	And then eventually, if this catches on widespread, then they'll eventually get rid of the core
1424480	1426000	model altogether.
1426000	1429440	Or it actually is something coming from Microsoft saying, hey, we're getting rid of the core
1429440	1431120	model.
1431120	1436400	I don't think that's actually been announced yet, so if that is going to happen, it probably
1436400	1438360	won't happen until after Christmas.
1438360	1441800	Wow, lots and lots of comments from chat on this one.
1441800	1444680	DJ Dark Knight says Sears has never had the core models.
1444680	1447800	Of course, I don't know a lot of people that do their gaming purchases at Sears, but I
1447800	1450400	suppose somebody must because they're in the gaming business.
1450400	1454920	My thought was always that they should, now that they're dropping the price of the system
1454920	1459760	or something, just include the 64 meg memory unit with it.
1459760	1464000	Then the people can say, okay, well I can buy this system and have something to save
1464000	1465000	on.
1465000	1469800	Raven's Dolphin says, when Walmart says no more cores 360s, then it's done.
1469800	1472280	Ross Steel UT says, of course Microsoft would deny.
1472280	1476400	They probably also denied that the core only counts for maybe 20% of their sales.
1476400	1479400	Bandit says they should keep the core for people who want to upgrade their memory later
1479400	1480400	on.
1480400	1481400	It'll be more accessible to everyone.
1481400	1484560	I don't think they were going to announce the HDMI thing either until it leaked out,
1484560	1487100	so I don't know.
1487100	1489400	If you want to join our chat room and give your comments, if you're listening live here
1489400	1493120	on this Sunday night when we tape live, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
1493120	1498720	By the way, some other chatters following up on the whole Target, HD DVD thing, GS191
1498720	1501880	says this, Target is not getting rid of HD DVD.
1501880	1506220	The Blu-ray camp just inked a deal for their product to be displayed more through the end
1506220	1507220	of the year.
1507220	1512640	I think Harold follows that up with a web link that says that's true, so very interesting.
1512640	1523280	Honestly, myself, being that I've got a Blu-ray player, then...
1523280	1524920	You don't have an HD DVD player, right?
1524920	1525920	Nope.
1525920	1528120	That's one of the things you don't have in your house, amazingly enough.
1528120	1529120	One of them.
1529120	1530120	Amongst all the other crap you have.
1530120	1532080	You don't have an HD DVD player, though.
1532080	1535240	No, I actually know more people who have Blu-ray players myself.
1535240	1537040	Well, because they're built into the PlayStation 3s.
1537040	1538720	You don't own PlayStation 3s.
1538720	1539720	Really?
1539720	1544640	This new Vio actually comes built in with Blu-ray for the players.
1544640	1545960	See, Sony just used...
1545960	1548920	I mean, if HD DVD loses, then it loses.
1548920	1551280	Fine, I went with the wrong format, but...
1551280	1552280	I'm surprised.
1552280	1554360	Sony is really pushing with all their...
1554360	1556480	Because, you know, Sony is not just a gaming company.
1556480	1560980	They are an electronics company and a major one at that, so they've been able to sneak
1560980	1565400	Blu-ray into all these other little places, and it's worked for them, where, for whatever
1565400	1567120	reason, beta didn't.
1567120	1571560	Well, there is still some hope, though, for people who...
1571560	1579280	Well, I guess it's not specifically HD-related, but they are dropping the price of the Xbox
1579280	1581720	360.
1581720	1586960	It actually said that it was scheduled to happen on August 8th, so the price reduction
1586960	1589880	should already be in place.
1589880	1598840	So we are seeing the Elite model go to $449, the Pro model to $349, and the Core at $279.
1598840	1605960	So of course, the premium had the biggest drop, given that that's the best seller.
1605960	1610600	And that price drop was totally a surprise to me.
1610600	1612400	And everybody out there on the internet.
1612400	1615640	Yes, the entire internet was shocked and awed at that price drop.
1615640	1616640	I'm actually curious, though...
1616640	1619880	Well, I guess I don't think we have any stories on this tonight, so I can say that...
1619880	1624200	I think I want to say I read somewhere that Amazon, the sales of the Xbox 360 went through
1624200	1626360	the roof after the price drop.
1626360	1630200	So I'm just kind of curious if the same thing happened at the retail outlets or what happened.
1630200	1633720	Are you surprised they made the move at this time?
1633720	1636480	Because I'm actually kind of a little surprised they didn't wait until a little closer to
1636480	1637480	Christmas.
1637480	1640800	Like, I would have expected the price drop a little more October-ish.
1640800	1644760	But maybe then again with Halo 3 coming out when it is, maybe they wanted to do it in
1644760	1647880	advance of Halo 3, which would certainly make sense.
1647880	1649880	So who knows?
1649880	1653520	I was just going to mention, there was another story I remember reading, I guess, that the
1653520	1661680	NPD group did a survey with people asking them whether they're aware of different features
1661680	1662680	of their console.
1662680	1667060	And I guess almost 60% of people didn't realize that the Playstation 3 had a Blu-ray player
1667060	1672080	in it, or had never used it for Blu-ray movies, which I thought that was a little bit funny.
1672080	1675840	Anywho, what I want to know is what are they using it for then?
1675840	1676840	Motorstorm?
1676840	1679720	Is that the basketball game that's on it?
1679720	1680720	Is that it?
1680720	1682640	It must be all that wonderful download content that's online.
1682640	1683640	Oh wait, no.
1683640	1684640	That's right.
1684640	1688800	Anyways, other countries are also getting a 360 price drop.
1688800	1691800	In fact, Canadians are seeing a pretty big price drop.
1691800	1698560	They will see a $100, of course that's in Canadian money, drop on the premium and core
1698560	1699560	systems.
1699560	1701160	So that's pretty awesome.
1701160	1708720	And yeah, so after that price drop, the premium will be running, I guess, approximately $378
1708720	1709720	US.
1709720	1715200	Still, of course, with the exchange rates, they pay more.
1715200	1717420	But for them, hey, $100 is cheaper.
1717420	1718420	That's pretty awesome.
1718420	1721360	I was going to say, usually with the exchange rates, the Canadians are paying a little bit
1721360	1724720	more for their gaming than we are, but it's certainly not the jump that you see from going
1724720	1726820	overseas to here.
1726820	1728680	So yeah, kind of interesting.
1728680	1733000	Well one thing that you can use your brand new Xbox 360 for if you decided to buy one
1733000	1737040	with the price cut is the firmware update that went out this week.
1737040	1741600	Unfortunately the firmware update wasn't really that exciting, it was just a small little
1741600	1742600	update.
1742600	1746600	And according to Major Nelson's blog, really the only thing that it was doing is preparing
1746600	1752960	the Xbox 360 to use wireless guitar controllers for you Guitar Hero 3 players, and if any
1752960	1756080	eventually come out for Rock Band and all that good stuff.
1756080	1759300	So there really isn't a whole lot else to that firmware update.
1759300	1763040	You know, it's kind of a bummer too because when you turn on your Xbox 360 and you see
1763040	1766600	ooh, a new firmware update is available, you kind of start to get a little bit excited
1766600	1770320	like ooh, I wonder what new features they've added this week, or what they're adding, or
1770320	1775120	is this the big seasonal update because they do a big one in fall and I think spring, of
1775120	1778000	course it's summer, so that wouldn't make sense for my brain to go there.
1778000	1781440	But you can still help but get a little bit excited when the thing comes up and says there's
1781440	1784320	a firmware update, like ooh, what cool new feature are they going to add, and then turns
1784320	1786320	out to be nothing.
1786320	1787320	Oh well.
1787320	1788320	That's poo.
1788320	1789320	Oh well, I mean.
1789320	1790320	That's big stinky poop.
1790320	1794640	It was unexpected so it's, you know, can't really beg for a lot with that.
1794640	1800520	For anybody who is actually excited about anything having to do with Halo, well Halo
1800520	1808480	3 I should say, or likes having green Xbox 360s, the Halo themed Xbox 360 will be out
1808480	1818440	in September, priced for $399 with a wireless headset for $59.99.
1818440	1822640	I don't really see anything all that special about it, it says it's spartan green and gold,
1822640	1830100	really it looks to me like it's baby poop green with orange, at least that's what it
1830100	1832780	looks like, so.
1832780	1837840	As far as your HDMI cables, that comes separately.
1837840	1840560	That's exactly how they should market it too.
1840560	1841560	It's the new baby poop green.
1841560	1842560	You have an HDMI port.
1842560	1845200	Well they all have the HDMI port now.
1845200	1846720	But no cable.
1846720	1850040	Really the only thing that you get for the extra $50 is you get a plain charge kit that's
1850040	1856440	also the, I guess, baby poop green, and you get, you know, the wonderful baby poop green
1856440	1857440	paint job.
1857440	1860520	It does look like baby poop, it's that type of green.
1860520	1865600	If you do want HDMI cables, those will cost you about $50 and they're going to be sold
1865600	1870820	separately actually now that all the 360s with the premiums with the HDMI are coming
1870820	1872600	out.
1872600	1878220	So yay, you get the, and there's no even, there's no Halo 3 with it even, which is kind
1878220	1881140	of come on, I mean, why didn't they do that?
1881140	1884760	Because you know there's people that are going to go out and buy their Xbox 360 the day that
1884760	1886160	Halo 3 comes out.
1886160	1888840	They're going to finally make that upgrade because they've been playing Halo 2 this whole
1888840	1889840	time.
1889840	1897000	Oh my god, there are also two custom Halo 3 controllers there, one for the Covenant,
1897000	1901960	one for Spartans that are done by Todd McFarlane with collectible figurines, those are also
1901960	1907280	coming out, as well as skins, I'm sure, by Mad Catz and other companies, as well as useless
1907280	1912040	shit like an ammo case that holds controllers and crap from other companies.
1912040	1916280	People, I mean, really if you want Halo 3 and you're that big of a Halo nut, then you're
1916280	1919840	going to be a sucker and buy all this shit, and if not, you're not really that big of
1919840	1921560	a fan.
1921560	1927120	Son of Dad in our chatroom at chat.orangelaunchradio.com calls the new color, Split P in Halo chunky
1927120	1933800	style Xbox 360, delicious, mmm, yummy.
1933800	1940960	Well anyways, speaking of Halo 3, apparently there are a lot of fans out there, who knew,
1940960	1948200	and Halo 3 has become the fastest selling pre-ordered game in history.
1948200	1952860	Apparently one million pre-orders have been taken in North America, a new record apparently
1952860	1955400	for those keeping track.
1955400	1961040	And also, you know, this all kind of ties in with their marketing campaign, including
1961040	1966120	7-Eleven, Burger King, Comcast, Mountain Dew, and Pontiac.
1966120	1971040	Honestly, Pontiac, how the fuck does that relate to Halo?
1971040	1975200	I can understand the 7-Eleven, because you know, you have that Halo Mountain Dew crap
1975200	1979000	and stuff that you can sell that, alright, and then maybe Burger King, because it's on
1979000	1984580	their cups and shit, maybe there's some kid's toys or something, but Pontiac, come on, there's
1984580	1985580	nothing to, seriously.
1985580	1988440	Were you going to hop on the bandwagon?
1988440	1990920	Are you really that hard up in selling your cars?
1990920	1993920	Maybe they're going to make tags.
1993920	1996720	I think that's pretty funny.
1996720	1999800	Maybe Pontiac's getting into the war car building business.
1999800	2003760	But really, would you want a war car made by Pontiac?
2003760	2009400	I mean, that's just like, that's just like, you know, this is my Volkswagen killing machine.
2009400	2011040	I mean, it's just, it's crap.
2011040	2016600	No, no, no, because remember Volkswagen wouldn't lend their likenesses for that kind of thing.
2016600	2021000	You know, I'd buy the Volkswagen one before I'd buy a Ford one, that's for sure, found
2021000	2023440	on road debt.
2023440	2025400	And I fix off and repair daily.
2025400	2029240	I hope they release like a Covenant car and a Spartan car, then they can have the fucking
2029240	2030240	Halo fans.
2030240	2034880	I'm going to fucking kill you in my Spartan car, yeah that's right, it's better than your
2034880	2035880	Covenant car.
2035880	2038480	Actually, I'm driving a Pontiac, you're both losers.
2038480	2041960	I'd buy a Pontiac if they put guns in the front of it, so I can shoot people who get
2041960	2042960	in my way.
2042960	2044960	I mean, come on.
2044960	2045960	Alright, maybe not.
2045960	2050760	But I wanted to say about this, how is Halo 3 tied into the Comcast thing, because they're
2050760	2054960	going to have a little... we didn't get a baby shit green cable box.
2054960	2059240	Here's why, they're going to have videos on their Comcast on demand service, the service
2059240	2063440	that I never use, ever, they're going to have that on there.
2063440	2064440	Hooray!
2064440	2066040	Are they even going to bother and do it in HD?
2066040	2070720	I guess this justifies them raising the rates on their cable, you know, oh thank you, I
2070720	2078760	get Halo exclusive content, and you're raising my rates and they're $5, thank you Comcast!
2078760	2085560	Oh, I could have just imagined my roommate's reaction if, you know, because it was bad
2085560	2089560	enough when they only offered him the $20 discount for wasting his whole day, and then
2089560	2094200	like fucking up his total order, I could just imagine if the thing had been, you know, oh
2094200	2099400	well, we're really sorry about the inconvenience, here's some free Halo 3 trailers!
2099400	2100400	Yay!
2100400	2101400	Ah!
2101400	2103960	Joy plus Rapture equals no.
2103960	2104960	Wow.
2104960	2105960	Interesting.
2105960	2111280	Yeah, I'm not surprised about the whole pre-order record-breaking thing, because like what you
2111280	2114480	said, the whole 7-Eleven tie-ins, like we talked about last week, how you can pre-order
2114480	2117520	Halo 3 at 7-Eleven now, it's crazy.
2117520	2121960	And then just the fact that, you know, many, many stores whore their pre-orderings now,
2121960	2125960	they've all taken a page from GameStop, and of course GameStop's still king of their game
2125960	2128320	every time somebody comes in, did you want to reserve Halo 3?
2128320	2129480	Did you want to reserve Halo 3?
2129480	2133920	Oh, I see you're buying Bratz for the DS, did you want to reserve Halo 3?
2133920	2137200	It's like, hey, you want to buy Madden from us?
2137200	2138200	We'll give you a free mini-poster.
2138200	2140880	No!
2140880	2141880	I don't like Madden.
2141880	2142880	How about Halo 3?
2142880	2143880	Now fuck off!
2143880	2148280	I'm sorry, I've been hearing about nothing but Madden lately.
2148280	2151440	You just bought Halo 3, do you want to pre-order Halo 3?
2151440	2157840	Every time I call Dan's store, it's like, blah blah blah blah blah reserve Madden, no!
2157840	2162400	I can imagine walking into GameStop, yes, I'm here to reserve Halo 3.
2162400	2163400	Oh, great!
2163400	2165840	Would you like to reserve Halo 4 while you're at it?
2165840	2171920	I mean, if anyone, if they should have partnered up with a car dealership, or a car company,
2171920	2175880	it should have been like the fucking Hummer, because at least that's the size of the Warthog,
2175880	2176880	okay?
2176880	2177880	Humvee.
2177880	2180720	Humvee, whatever.
2180720	2188140	The other thing I'm kind of curious about with all this is, oh, I know what I wanted
2188140	2191080	to say earlier that I couldn't think of.
2191080	2196240	I think one of the worst trends in retail across the board that I've seen now is fake
2196240	2199840	boxes to try to get you to pre-order the game.
2199840	2203200	You'll be walking down Best Buy and go, oh, I didn't know this game was out, and you reach
2203200	2207160	for it and you grab it, and then it's like, oh, a little sticker, pre-order, I know, and
2207160	2209800	it's a horrible, horrible trick that I always fall for.
2209800	2214560	Last summer, they had Madden 08 already in GameStop, I kid you not, they made up their
2214560	2218840	own box art so you can pre-order Madden 08, and this was literally weeks after Madden
2218840	2224000	07 came out, I mean, come on, seriously.
2224000	2228120	Tiger Claw says, Sky, I went to GameStop on Saturday and one of the employees, for some
2228120	2232280	bizarre reason, was wearing a cardboard box over his head.
2232280	2234400	Did it say pre-order Halo 3 on the top, maybe?
2234400	2235680	I don't know.
2235680	2240380	And the other thing, do we really need press releases that go out when your game's put
2240380	2241380	out?
2241380	2246560	It's the fastest selling game ever until the next game comes out and then it'll sell more.
2246560	2250960	I didn't even realize that there was a specific date when they started taking Halo 3 pre-orders,
2250960	2256680	I thought we'd been booking Halo 3 since, you know, everyone knew Halo 3 was in existence.
2256680	2260640	Alright, anyhow, let's move on off the Halo 3 talk, because there's plenty of other things
2260640	2265980	on the Xbox 360 people are looking forward to, including the next round of Xbox Live
2265980	2271160	Arcade games, and there's a lot of games slated to be coming out over the next couple months,
2271160	2280000	including the much anticipated Hexic 2, also Echo the Dolphin, WarWorld, Geon Emotions,
2280000	2286880	Puzzle Quest, Space Giraffe, Streets of Rage 2, and of course Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo
2286880	2289920	HD Remix.
2289920	2291840	But I'm actually very much looking forward to that game.
2291840	2297160	Apparently they've done some balancing, they've changed a little bit the drops, like you know
2297160	2301720	how, for instance, Chun Li's drop pattern kind of sucked, like you know, because it
2301720	2304760	basically created power gems if you dropped a bunch on your opponent?
2304760	2306360	That's why you always use Donovan.
2306360	2311840	Well now, well they've changed some things so that like Chun Li now drops 120% more blocks,
2311840	2315440	even though it's in the pattern, and they've scaled some other people back to 80% of their
2315440	2318280	blocks, so to try and even out the way people play, so.
2318280	2320300	Yay, more power gems!
2320300	2321760	Could be interesting, I know.
2321760	2324380	That's kind of what I thought when I read that, I'm like, so they want you to make more
2324380	2325380	power gems?
2325380	2330520	Okay, okay, Janami, you don't use Dan unless you think that you're like God's gift to Puzzle
2330520	2331520	Fighter.
2331520	2335040	Or if you want to have a really hilarious Dan vs. Dan match.
2335040	2337680	Because he does nothing but drop red blocks.
2337680	2339480	Exactly, that's awesome.
2339480	2344920	Oh, the chat room is daring to correct me, Hitstun says, there's an X dash mode with
2344920	2348240	the new drop patterns, but there's also the original X mode.
2348240	2349820	My bad.
2349820	2351920	I'm still looking forward to the release, no matter what.
2351920	2353920	It'll be fun.
2353920	2358120	You know, I bet I could take you on Puzzle Fighter, Rob.
2358120	2360920	Well, we shall see in a couple weeks when the game comes out, won't we?
2360920	2361920	Yes, we will.
2361920	2368760	Well, speaking of other things that are coming out, though, well, rumored to come out, EGM
2368760	2377200	reported Penny Arcade is going to be having a game that will be on Xbox Live Arcade.
2377200	2378200	Possibly.
2378200	2379200	Possibly.
2379200	2387360	Um, we have a label of Penny Arcade Adventures Episode 1 on the Rainslick Precipice of Darkness
2387360	2389520	to be out in the fall.
2389520	2393000	This one surprised me at all, because there's already Penny Arcade content on Xbox Live
2393000	2397880	and has been for a long, long time, because you can get, like, themes and little, uh,
2397880	2399800	clip arts, or the little game rickshirts and stuff.
2399800	2401800	I hope it's amazing.
2401800	2407440	I don't, if it's anything less than amazing, I'll be like, well, crap!
2407440	2409080	I'll probably download it anyway.
2409080	2412360	But it wouldn't surprise me at all if there ended up being a Penny Arcade game on the
2412360	2416220	marketplace, because Microsoft's kind of liked that lately, is that they're really trying
2416220	2420360	to get into those, you know, fan communities and the thing that the internet's all abuzz
2420360	2421360	about.
2421360	2422360	Microsoft wants a part of that, so.
2422360	2424680	Well, there's nothing actually confirmed yet, so.
2424680	2427180	All they'd have to do is throw money at them.
2427180	2429440	Money is what moves the world.
2429440	2430440	Exactly.
2430440	2431440	Awesome.
2431440	2436640	Well, anyways, um, we've got some good releases this week, and of course, unless you've been
2436640	2442180	hiding under a rock, um, and even then, you might still know about this, Madden is coming
2442180	2448240	out for everything, including the Coleco, Atari, okay, maybe I made that last part up.
2448240	2449240	Cool!
2449240	2450240	I want to get Madden on the Atari.
2450240	2451240	I want it on the Turbo Duo!
2451240	2452240	That's amazing.
2452240	2453600	Have you seen the Simpsons game trailer?
2453600	2454760	It actually has that.
2454760	2460240	It says, coming out for all game systems, and it shows the Coleco, Atari, you know,
2460240	2463440	like, Intellivision, Jaguar, that's awesome.
2463440	2466160	Dude, they should put it out on those systems, that would be rad.
2466160	2471520	So, no, that, it is coming out on most everything, I think, except for the Game Boy Advance.
2471520	2477480	And then, also, if you're not into Madden, on PlayStation 2, Shin Megami Tensei Persona
2477480	2482840	3 is coming out on PlayStation 2, and by the way, I brought my copy for you so you can
2482840	2484840	try it out.
2484840	2485840	Hooray!
2485840	2492160	And then, let's see, Metropolis Mania 2, that's also coming out.
2492160	2498680	Let's see, Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1, yay.
2498680	2507600	On PSP, Dungeons and Dragons Tactics, Ghost Recon, oh, no, that's next week, sorry, sorry.
2507600	2516120	Let's see, other than that, oh, DS, DS are some good stuff.
2516120	2518280	Let's see, Luminous Ark, that's supposed to be pretty good.
2518280	2521600	Rune Factory, a fantasy Harvest Moon.
2521600	2524200	How many Harvest Moon games will come out this year?
2524200	2525200	That's a good question.
2525200	2530000	Heroes of Mana, that's supposed to be actually pretty good on DS.
2530000	2538040	Operation Vietnam, and High School Musical, Makin' the Cut, and yeah, that's pretty much
2538040	2539040	it.
2539040	2540040	It's Madden or nothin'.
2540040	2549840	Alright, well, I'm heading over to the Japanese release dates, and I'm here to tell you there's
2549840	2555000	not a goddamn thing worth noting coming out in Japan this week, nothing, there's nothing,
2555000	2556920	absolutely nothing coming out over there.
2556920	2560920	However, if you happen to live in Korea, you're getting some of the same things we are.
2560920	2566200	You're also getting Persona 3 on the PlayStation 2, but otherwise, it's a very slow week, nothing
2566200	2567200	of note.
2567200	2570800	I mean, I guess there's a couple small titles, but nothing worth mentioning, honestly, so
2570800	2571800	slow week.
2571800	2576120	Well, yeah, it's about the same, I'm over in the UK right now.
2576120	2580480	Premiere Manager 08, and Two Worlds.
2580480	2581480	Slow times.
2581480	2582480	That's it.
2582480	2585440	However, lucky people are getting Blue Dragon on the 24th.
2585440	2586840	I think we are, too.
2586840	2587840	Yep.
2587840	2591920	So, hey, we get something at the same time, and they're getting Blazing Angels later,
2591920	2592920	too.
2592920	2593920	Very cool.
2593920	2596240	You know, and this is just the calm before the storm right here.
2596240	2600800	This August is always the slow period, so we're gonna start seeing things really pick
2600800	2606080	up very soon here, like, you know, Blue Dragon, Metroid Prime 3, then we get in next month,
2606080	2607320	and then, you know, the Halo, everything.
2607320	2608320	It's gonna be a mess.
2608320	2613920	There's a to-be announced on here for Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System.
2613920	2616080	We need to get a date on that.
2616080	2617920	I thought that already came out.
2617920	2618920	It came out in Japan, yeah.
2618920	2621280	That was last week's releases in Japan.
2621280	2624520	It's sating pending for the UK, but nothing specific.
2624520	2625520	Let me put out a press release.
2625520	2626680	The issue would come out over here.
2626680	2630480	Let me put out a press release saying that's the crappiest title for a game, or a Final
2630480	2633000	Fantasy game.
2633000	2636360	The Rob D. would like to say August ain't slow this year because you're getting a Bioshock,
2636360	2637360	a Madden, everything.
2637360	2641240	Yeah, I know, I know, but I'm saying, like, you know, that's all towards the end of the
2641240	2642240	month.
2642240	2643240	Whoa, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2643240	2644240	I wanna play Blue Dragon and Bioshock.
2644240	2647560	Rob was talking about, well, not Blue Dragon, but I'm talking about the other stuff.
2647560	2648560	No.
2648560	2649560	Well, just because you guys are anti-Madden.
2649560	2652400	It's still a slow month, even though those games are coming out.
2652400	2654560	I mean, look at it, okay.
2654560	2662680	So Bioshock, that's coming out next week, in the week of the 21st, and, well, that's
2662680	2663680	it.
2663680	2664680	I see.
2664680	2666560	So basically you're saying the problem with this month is that you just have, like, these
2666560	2669520	few A-list titles kind of tent-pulling us through the month.
2669520	2670520	Pretty much.
2670520	2671520	There's not a lot of other stuff.
2671520	2675080	Bioshock's next week, and then the week after that, you've got the Blue Dragon, Metrory
2675080	2681600	Prime 3, Stuntman Ignition, Tiger Woods 08, and stuff like that, but that's pretty much
2681600	2682840	it for the rest of the month.
2682840	2688920	September is crazy, and then beyond that, it's just, ugh, I don't even wanna know.
2688920	2689920	I fear November.
2689920	2690920	November's scary.
2690920	2695320	I'm sorry, Blue Dragon's the only one out of that list that I'm having any problem looking
2695320	2696320	forward to.
2696320	2697320	December's getting scary, too.
2697320	2698640	I'm not as looking forward to Metroid Prime 3 as you might think.
2698640	2703120	I was very, very, very disappointed that Nintendo did not decide to go online multiplayer with
2703120	2704120	it.
2704120	2706120	We need a Metroid Metroid.
2706120	2707120	Like old-school Metroid?
2707120	2708120	Yes.
2708120	2709120	Well, we get them on Virtual Console, if nothing else.
2709120	2710120	No.
2710120	2711120	Next week, I think.
2711120	2712520	We need an actual new Metroid game.
2712520	2714480	We need Metroid Wii.
2714480	2715480	We'll see.
2715480	2716480	Metroid Metroid.
2716480	2717480	We love Metroid.
2717480	2718480	But that's what we want.
2718480	2719480	That's Metroid Prime 3.
2719480	2720480	No.
2720480	2721480	No.
2721480	2722480	You want a 2D.
2722480	2723480	You need to be specific.
2723480	2724480	You want a 2D Metroid on the Wii.
2724480	2725480	I want a 2D Metroid on the Wii.
2725480	2726480	Alright.
2726480	2732160	Or, or like a, um, like, you know how, um, the Sega Aegis Fantasy Zone is with the, uh,
2732160	2734160	the, the 3D, 2D look?
2734160	2735160	What?
2735160	2736160	You need something like that.
2736160	2740480	I don't know if you heard, but there's, uh, rumors going around saying that Castlevania
2740480	2746280	Aria of Sorrow's gonna be, uh, shown at Let's Big, um, on the PC.
2746280	2750160	And so, if it's on the PC, then it could ideally come to consoles.
2750160	2751160	Interesting.
2751160	2752960	And that was the Game Boy Advance one, so.
2752960	2754720	We'll see.
2754720	2757160	Let's go ahead and move on and get back into some news.
2757160	2762760	Anyhoo, um, so we were talking a little bit earlier about firmware updates for the 360.
2762760	2767440	Well, the Wii, you know, couldn't be left out, so they decided to update to version
2767440	2771680	3, which you get some spiffy shit with that.
2771680	2777320	Um, now, nothing major like the Check Me Out channel or anything like that, but, uh, you
2777320	2784000	get a wonderful digital clock, hurrah, and, uh, the Forecast channel now displays the
2784000	2789280	current condition, yet it doesn't display the temperature, and the current condition
2789280	2793580	is still, like, I'll boot up my Wii at, like, 4 o'clock in the evening and it, it shows
2793580	2795800	a picture of a moon.
2795800	2798080	I'm like, look outside, you stupid Wii.
2798080	2800760	They're just trying to let you know that the moon's still there, okay?
2800760	2801760	Oh, good.
2801760	2802760	I'm glad to hear it.
2802760	2803760	Moon not destroyed yet.
2803760	2804760	Thank God.
2804760	2805760	Okay.
2805760	2806760	Oh, hooray.
2806760	2812040	This channel can now display two scrolling headlines at a time in the Wii menu.
2812040	2818080	Um, then, uh, let's see, the message board now has, uh, today's accomplishments message
2818080	2822880	as a white message, which will allow you to stand out, or allow it to stand out from other
2822880	2823880	messages.
2823880	2827160	I still hate those today's accomplishments things anyways.
2827160	2832760	Uh, address book can now be shifted around using A and B. There's a calendar that no
2832760	2838600	longer shows today's accomplishments, and scrolling messages in the Wii message board
2838600	2841360	now use a different sound.
2841360	2844640	I guess in the Wii shop channel, they've got some other stuff.
2844640	2849800	You can search by category, publisher, genre, but you still can't look at videos within
2849800	2851260	the Wii shop channel.
2851260	2853520	You have to go onto the internet to see that.
2853520	2858960	Um, and then, uh, of course, you know, there's some settings, I guess, warning added to pre-system
2858960	2865360	update detailing that, uh, technically modified consoles may cease to function.
2865360	2867660	So we break your mod chips!
2867660	2868660	That's right.
2868660	2874880	Um, the other thing that it did allow, um, is the freeloader to stop working.
2874880	2880520	So if you were, uh, thinking about using your freeloader to play other region, uh, GameCube
2880520	2882640	games, you just got served.
2882640	2883960	You got fucked over.
2883960	2889440	I'm surprised to see Nintendo caring so much because they didn't in the past.
2889440	2892680	Maybe they were afraid of future exploits like that, I don't know.
2892680	2893680	Who knows?
2893680	2899160	Uh, one other thing that should be said is the Wii system update also made the USB keyboards
2899160	2900440	now start working.
2900440	2905240	Uh, you can actually plug in a USB keyboard into the back of the Wii, uh, and you can
2905240	2908780	use your keyboard for the message board messages.
2908780	2910880	You can use it to type in some things.
2910880	2915600	Uh, you can use it when you're, um, like writing questions for everybody votes or whatever.
2915600	2918680	Uh, you can also do the internet channel.
2918680	2919680	Hooray.
2919680	2925400	However, you can't use it in the shop channel to search and I don't know what that's about.
2925400	2927800	Uh, can you use it in the internet channel?
2927800	2928800	I thought you couldn't.
2928800	2930600	Uh, apparently you can.
2930600	2931600	I'm pretty sure you can.
2931600	2933840	So, I don't know, I'll have to try it.
2933840	2938760	I bought a USB keyboard for Final Fantasy XI for the 360 and then I stopped playing.
2938760	2940600	So I have one sitting out there that I don't really use.
2940600	2941600	And it glows blue.
2941600	2942600	It's really pretty.
2942600	2943600	So.
2943600	2945600	I still had one from when I played, uh, Blue Burst.
2945600	2946600	Ah.
2946600	2950000	Well, or if I should just say Fantasy Star Online.
2950000	2951000	Right.
2951000	2952000	Hm.
2952000	2955680	At any rate, there's other stuff.
2955680	2956680	Well for anyone...
2956680	2957680	I'm sorry.
2957680	2958680	I'm sorry.
2958680	2959680	I'm sorry.
2959680	2960680	You know what?
2960680	2961680	You're right.
2961680	2962680	I screwed up.
2962680	2963680	It's, it's actually, you can't use it to do any of that other stuff.
2963680	2965940	You can only use the keyboard for the message board messages.
2965940	2966940	I screwed up.
2966940	2969200	That was a can't on the internet channel.
2969200	2970200	My bad.
2970200	2973280	Well that's what I get for not testing it myself.
2973280	2975400	I was, I'm just not kinda interested in that.
2975400	2980240	I'm like, why would I use the Wii to surf the internet when I have a computer five steps
2980240	2981240	away that can do it?
2981240	2983240	I just don't get it.
2983240	2984240	Sorry kids.
2984240	2986200	Some people I guess want everything to do everything.
2986200	2990840	I like having one thing that does one thing and then I think it does another thing.
2990840	2997000	Well anyway, um, for anyone who has actually been keeping up with Super Mario Galaxy, there
2997000	3003840	has been a few screenshots put in Famitsu, um, showing that there is a desert world and
3003840	3008240	a haunted house so we can get our buddy Boo coming back.
3008240	3011200	A desert world and a haunted house in a Mario game?
3011200	3012520	That's completely new.
3012520	3015800	Well, I don't think, was there actually a desert level in Mario Sunshine?
3015800	3018880	In like every single Mario game since Mario Brothers 3.
3018880	3019880	I don't know.
3019880	3023720	I lost interest in Mario Sunshine about halfway through it.
3023720	3031240	But Super Mario Galaxy will be coming out later this year and I want, and I want it
3031240	3034840	to actually keep my attention.
3034840	3036440	Awesome.
3036440	3039720	Now, some other interesting stuff coming out.
3039720	3047000	There was a patent found online for a motion sensing portable or at least something for
3047000	3055000	a portable system to sense directional movements on the all different axis, basically a six
3055000	3060300	axis built into a Game Boy Advance type thing.
3060300	3071160	So um, maybe something in the future to be added to the DS, new handheld console, who
3071160	3072160	knows.
3072160	3077000	If I were to guess, I would say that maybe something to plug into the Game Boy Advance,
3077000	3084400	or actually the DS, the Game Boy Advance slot, to use that actually as a controller for different
3084400	3085960	games.
3085960	3091920	Because you know, the DS, it can connect to the Wii, so might as well add some tilt sensing
3091920	3094000	to it as well.
3094000	3097720	God, I hope they're not putting out another portable system.
3097720	3098720	Oh, they will.
3098720	3102600	And they'll call it the Game Boy something else and they'll be like, hi, you get to buy
3102600	3104400	it again, bitch.
3104400	3108000	Part of me kind of hopes that they're doing this so that nobody else will.
3108000	3113460	Like maybe they're doing one of those, like, what is it, the company that keeps filing
3113460	3115000	the patents on the immersion?
3115000	3118640	Yeah, like they're doing one of those types of patents where they're just doing it before
3118640	3123720	anyone else can think of it because of the success of the Wii, I don't know.
3123720	3126560	I just hope not.
3126560	3127560	We'll see.
3127560	3133280	Meanwhile, for the Nintendo consoles, as we mentioned earlier, Metroid and Super Metroid
3133280	3137240	have been confirmed that they are on their way to the Virtual Console a little later
3137240	3142200	this month, leading up to, of course, the release of Metroid Prime 3.
3142200	3146680	All this can be found in the new Metroid Prime 3 preview channel, which you can download
3146680	3149960	for the Wii, which I tried to do, but it would work.
3149960	3152880	I got like three download arrows in a row, so I was like, forget it.
3152880	3156560	Did you check out the Metroid Prime 3 preview channel, Loki?
3156560	3157960	No.
3157960	3159240	I could care less.
3159240	3164240	I heard that basically it just has some pictures and things, and it has streaming video incorporated
3164240	3165240	into the channel.
3165240	3166240	Awesome!
3166240	3170560	Why don't they do that with anything else, say the Virtual Console games, you bastards?
3170560	3173000	You prove that you can do it, come on, do it.
3173000	3179560	I don't know, I would also just kind of like to see demos, but I know the online storage
3179560	3181680	on the Wii isn't very big, so probably asking for a lot.
3181680	3185560	Stop crippling your damn system, people, seriously.
3185560	3187120	Interesting.
3187120	3191280	Drunami says, it's cool, but it's YouTube, basically.
3191280	3196760	Well, you can't get an accurate portrayal of what the game looks like with something
3196760	3198080	like YouTube graphics.
3198080	3203000	I can't wait for someone to modify that channel, because I'm sure that whatever it's streaming
3203000	3208520	is probably off the internet and not on your console, so that would be pretty cool to change
3208520	3212200	the DNS in it or something, to stream video off of other things, so you could actually
3212200	3219160	turn it into not really YouTube, but I don't know, maybe get Justin TV on there or something.
3219160	3223520	Son of Dad says, I want streaming videos of Super Metroid.
3223520	3228680	Well, maybe somebody will make a streaming video of this next segment, it's something
3228680	3230760	we do every week here on the program.
3230760	3232600	It's Dark Sakura's website of the week.
3232600	3236260	She surfs the internet up and down and all around to find a website that she wants to
3236260	3238080	share with all of you at home.
3238080	3247760	So Dark Sakura, tell the kids where they should be pointing their web browsers this week.
3247760	3257360	Today's website of the week is really a result of wishful thinking on my part, but it's ferretsunlimited.org.
3257360	3261800	It's basically a shelter for ferrets.
3261800	3267560	They have adoption services and they're actually in Ohio, but the good thing about this site
3267560	3276240	is it also has information about needs, it has links to other shelters, how to shop,
3276240	3284320	how to take care of your ferret, and eventually, so I'm working on trying to eventually have
3284320	3286480	a ferret baby myself.
3286480	3288560	Even though they're still illegal to own in California, aren't they?
3288560	3291960	Not if somebody brings them out of state.
3291960	3295000	You're going to smuggle in a ferret in California?
3295000	3297120	You're going to smuggle in a ferret, hell yeah.
3297120	3298920	You probably wouldn't be the first one to do it, I'm sure.
3298920	3299920	Well, no.
3299920	3303520	And on top of that, there's a few other sites out there on the internet that tell you where
3303520	3310200	in California has a list of vets who will take care of your ferrets and not turn you
3310200	3311200	in.
3311200	3312920	So I think that's pretty cool.
3312920	3320440	Or even better, they still sell the crap for ferrets at the store, but even though they're
3320440	3321440	not allowed over here.
3321440	3323440	Ferrets are the best pets ever.
3323440	3329560	As much as I love my cat, I really want a ferret.
3329560	3331120	What's going to happen when you have a cat and a ferret?
3331120	3333000	Are they going to chase you around the house?
3333000	3336960	Actually, I'd love for Shermy to get chased around the house, that big fat animal.
3336960	3343200	Okay, my cat is intensely obese, and she's lazy, and I can't even chase her around the
3343200	3344200	house.
3344200	3348120	She's like, oh, it's just mom, she'll just step on me and then I'll be okay.
3348120	3354720	Rob Roberts, reminding you to help control the ferret population, have your ferret spayed
3354720	3355720	or neutered.
3355720	3356720	Yes.
3356720	3358320	And RossdielUT asks a good question.
3358320	3360960	I actually don't know the answer to it, but I'm assuming you do, DarkSakura.
3360960	3363560	Why the fuck are ferrets illegal in California?
3363560	3367480	That's, okay, I don't know the entire thing.
3367480	3371920	I actually haven't seen anything legitimate about it.
3371920	3377000	But they're talking about some problem with certain breeds of them being endangered and
3377000	3384120	with having this wild ferret population from strays, and I was like, that's stupid.
3384120	3385180	I'll tell you why.
3385180	3388000	It's because of Beastmaster.
3388000	3394160	Because they don't want another one of those crappy movies made in California, so no ferrets,
3394160	3396160	no Beastmaster sequel.
3396160	3397160	You know what?
3397160	3400940	My friend, before I moved out here, my friend- At least not another sequel.
3400940	3407040	My friend was going to give me his ferrets, and their names were Koto and Poto.
3407040	3410520	Okay, I'm on Wikipedia, of course, to find the answer to this question.
3410520	3412260	Oh, I'm on ferretnews.org.
3412260	3417280	And in the ferret article, it cites this reference, the Fish and Game Code of California, and
3417280	3422720	what it says, quote, animals of the families viviridae, I'm sorry, I'm totally mispronouncing
3422720	3427440	these, and mustelidae, which I'm assuming the ferrets belong to, in the order carnivora
3427440	3434280	are restricted, because such animals are undesirable and a menace to native wildlife, the agricultural
3434280	3437600	interests of the state, or to the public health or safety.
3437600	3440160	In other words, they don't want ferrets gone wild on mountain streets.
3440160	3444920	That's exactly, see, that's so stupid, and right now, they're actually still petitioning.
3444920	3457800	And the last news as of March 29th was that, it was on here saying that, they're doing
3457800	3462080	this thing where the government's trying to say that people do not want to have ferrets,
3462080	3465360	when actually the most population of people are like, we don't mind ferrets.
3465360	3469600	Yeah, but then you're going to get those two people that let the ferrets run loose outdoors
3469600	3474480	like a fucking cat, and it's going to kill things, and screw up the ecosystem, and then
3474480	3481480	you're like, I didn't know that ferrets shouldn't be outside, I'm totally oblivious to that.
3481480	3485760	And then, you know, they ruin it for everybody.
3485760	3488200	I don't know why we're talking about ferrets on a video game show.
3488200	3489200	Hey, that's Orange Lounge.
3489200	3491440	Yeah, we have ferrets, okay?
3491440	3492440	A ferret.
3492440	3493440	The ferret's in the box somewhere right now.
3493440	3494440	Ferrets are great.
3494440	3495960	We don't have a ferret in the studio yet.
3495960	3503600	But no, I really, I really, really, really, really want a ferret, so I'm working on trying
3503600	3505920	to get my significant other to agree.
3505920	3509780	All right, I really, really want to get back into gaming news.
3509780	3515880	Just to answer, son of dad ferrets live anywhere between 10 to 15 years.
3515880	3523880	All right, anyways, so interesting stuff, actually I guess a decent game for the iPod.
3523880	3524880	Hold on, wait a minute.
3524880	3528120	Tiger Claw in chat has a great point.
3528120	3530680	There's no ferret video games, like ever.
3530680	3531680	Let's fix that.
3531680	3534800	Has there ever been a ferret video game ever in existence?
3534800	3537680	Has a ferret even been a character in a video game?
3537680	3538680	Beastmaster.
3538680	3540880	I cannot, besides Beastmaster.
3540880	3545320	I can't think of anything where a, this is a travesty.
3545320	3547120	2DX16 ferret.
3547120	3550680	No, we need to have a game, okay, now that's.
3550680	3553200	It said 2DX Troopers, that's bullshit.
3553200	3557280	Let's put that up on the Orange Lounge Radio Xbox Live Arcade wish list, okay?
3557280	3561720	We have Laser Cats, the game, and now we have Ferret, the video game.
3561720	3563440	What, Loki?
3563440	3567840	Actually there has been a ferret video game for the Game Boy Color created by Culture
3567840	3568840	Brain.
3568840	3574440	It's called Ferret Monogatari Watashi no Okini Eri.
3574440	3576520	A big what?
3576520	3579840	Anyways, Ferret Story, my dear ferret.
3579840	3585720	It's a Japanese only video game that's a simulation style game where you take care of a ferret.
3585720	3588400	It says at the start of the game you choose one of three different colored ferrets, colors
3588400	3593060	are randomly chosen, the ferret is kept in the cage a bunch of the time but you have
3593060	3596160	to keep his water and food topped off and clean its litter box.
3596160	3599400	You can take the ferret out for walks or to play with it.
3599400	3603320	You can also even play mini games, one is a race, one is putting together a picture
3603320	3604320	and the other is dancing.
3604320	3605320	It's Nintend Ferret.
3605320	3609440	Yeah, and just like Nintendogs, the game gets fucking boring after playing it for an hour.
3609440	3611880	I'm getting the ferret game, you watch.
3611880	3614680	Hold on, we got a lot of comments in chat here on the ferret game.
3614680	3617800	SSJ100Matt says, there's a ferret-like creature in Pokemon.
3617800	3619760	Eh, not really a ferret.
3619760	3624800	TheRobD says, was there a ferret in Bible Adventures or in Super 3D Noah's Ark?
3624800	3630040	Probably not because ferrets are unclean, they're not God's animals.
3630040	3631800	They weren't allowed on the Ark.
3631800	3634200	Like lice, I don't think Noah took lice on the Ark.
3634200	3636200	That's ok, the lice were in their hair.
3636200	3639920	They didn't have rid back in the day.
3639920	3640920	Exactly.
3640920	3645120	RosteelUT says, putting a ferret in a video game will ensure that Schwarzenegger will
3645120	3648080	never let ferrets in.
3648080	3649920	You know what, he's a bastard anyway.
3649920	3651560	I didn't vote for him.
3651560	3655320	I voted for Gary Coleman.
3655320	3657280	I voted for Mary Carey.
3657280	3660920	Bandit says, there was a ferret in a video game called Penguin Wars for the Game Boy.
3660920	3665000	Why would a ferret be in a penguin game?
3665000	3666000	I don't know.
3666000	3667560	This is too bad.
3667560	3669760	Alright, sorry Loki.
3669760	3672040	Please put the show back on track if you can.
3672040	3676240	There's this news website that has a character that they talk about, well a video game news
3676240	3678440	site that's called Toothpick the Ferret.
3678440	3681160	He has a giant cloud sword.
3681160	3687200	Anyways, so yeah, a game for fifth generation iPods called Musica.
3687200	3695160	It's created by the man behind Parappa the Rapper and it's a game that's basically
3695160	3700580	a music visualizer game.
3700580	3706040	More background I guess than anything and I guess when the game creates visuals based
3706040	3711360	on the titles of your songs then it asks players to tap the center button in time with each
3711360	3713440	letter of the name.
3713440	3716960	And you get points for doing that and build up your combo, yada yada yada.
3716960	3723120	So if you're interested in buying it, it's $4.99 on the iTunes store.
3723120	3724120	I might have to check that out.
3724120	3726240	I've been kind of wanting to check that out.
3726240	3728360	But only if you have a fifth generation iPod.
3728360	3731720	Well I might be able to dig one of those up.
3731720	3735720	I think that this one I've got here is so I'll have to check that out.
3735720	3739120	Of course you won't be playing this because you hate Apple and you don't have an iPod
3739120	3741880	so that's right, not for you.
3741880	3746160	Let's see, Tigerclaw, I hate to go back to the ferret thing but the chat room just won't
3746160	3748920	shut up about it which is what I love about having a chat room.
3748920	3754320	Bright stun says Hotaru Fukuba from Garumarka the wolves had a yellow ferret.
3754320	3758440	I found the game online but it's a flash game.
3758440	3759720	Let's see what else is there.
3759720	3764200	Tigerclaw says if Nintendo or Sega is listening they have a potential franchise if they create
3764200	3767480	Sonic the Hedgehog type game starring a ferret.
3767480	3768640	Who knows.
3768640	3773960	Well one game that probably won't be getting a ferret any time soon is Beatmania 2DX.
3773960	3777900	Of course Loki was just talking about one other type of music game for the iPod.
3777900	3782400	We got to go all the way back and honor one of the first music game series there was in
3782400	3783400	existence.
3783400	3789120	Beatmania now in 2DX in its 15th incuration is now being location tested.
3789120	3791520	It's called DJ Troopers is the new theme.
3791520	3792520	It's so stupid.
3792520	3797000	It's kind of a silly name but of course a lot of people thought Red and Happy Sky were
3797000	3798320	dumb names too.
3798320	3802760	Happy Sky made sense at least it was very you know, Englishy.
3802760	3807120	Well DJ Troopers I give it a chance because it's kind of green like camo colors are kind
3807120	3812000	of green so that's one color they haven't really done yet so I give it a chance.
3812000	3814200	What is the cutest thing ever?
3814200	3819600	Beatmania 2DX has not really changed a whole lot over the past few games.
3819600	3823040	I mean little subtle changes here and there but the game itself hasn't changed a whole
3823040	3824040	lot.
3824040	3827280	Well it has been location tested or is it going through location tests in Tokyo right
3827280	3829720	now and some of the songs are sneaking out.
3829720	3835760	There's a new song from Chorus K called Evergreen, a new song from Akira Yamaoka called Shift.
3835760	3837960	It's a techno song, should be fun.
3837960	3841560	Another remix of A is in the game which should be interesting.
3841560	3845360	New songs of course are green colored in the song list.
3845360	3850560	The five keys modifier now uses keys three through seven instead of one through five
3850560	3854320	when playing on the two player side which is kind of a different type of change there
3854320	3862520	for those that like to play five key mode and a song called Deep Strikers has 1,528
3862520	3869240	notes on Hyper and is a 12 rated song on Double Hyper and that's going to be crazy.
3869240	3871480	They got rid of a bunch of songs by the way.
3871480	3875320	Bag is finally no longer in 2DX.
3875320	3879720	But also Sad Diamond Jealousy is also gone finally.
3879720	3880720	So there you go.
3880720	3884640	I'm sure we'll be hearing more about this on your favorite music gaming website as the
3884640	3887040	week goes on and more stuff comes out of location tests.
3887040	3890160	I'm sure YouTubes are coming far behind.
3890160	3895800	Well I have some happy that I hope would be something that happens.
3895800	3904360	There is actually a hint about there being a downloadable sequel on PSN for Parappa.
3904360	3907480	I would just be so happy to have more Parappa.
3907480	3911120	But right now it's in rumor phase.
3911120	3914640	The creator of Parappa the Rapper just sort of talked about it.
3914640	3915640	Not really.
3915640	3917560	He said, oh yeah, let's just do it.
3917560	3918560	Fuck Parappa.
3918560	3919560	I want Umjama Lammy.
3919560	3921360	Dude, that would be cool.
3921360	3926560	How come we always hear about Parappa this, Parappa that, Parappa remake, Parappa going
3926560	3930440	to be on the PlayStation Network maybe but there ain't shit about Umjama Lammy.
3930440	3933600	We need Umjama Death Metal.
3933600	3937280	Or what was it, there was Umjama Lammy and then Rami was her friend, right?
3937280	3938280	Rami.
3938280	3939280	And Rami was her opposite.
3939280	3940280	Who was the goth chick.
3940280	3941280	Yes.
3941280	3944040	And this is something that sucks because I wanted the hell level but instead they put
3944040	3946800	him on an island.
3946800	3951960	And Rasteel Utis theorizes maybe it's because Umjama Lammy sucked but that would be a lie
3951960	3956520	because Umjama Lammy was awesome so I failed to see your logic, I'm sorry.
3956520	3958280	So there you have it.
3958280	3962080	I suppose though if the Parappa thing did come out for the PlayStation Network and it
3962080	3968520	sold like crazy, maybe we could convince them to do an Umjama Lammy song in game.
3968520	3969520	We'll see.
3969520	3972120	All right, anyhow, that's going to bring this segment of Orange Launch Radio to a close
3972120	3977080	but we will be back with Part B right after a quick break.
3977080	3981760	Orange Launch Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
3981760	3982760	a week.
3982760	4006200	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Launch Radio.
