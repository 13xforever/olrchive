00:15.460 --> 00:19.780
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.780 --> 00:23.660
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August

00:23.660 --> 00:28.940
19th, 2007, for part B of episode number 243 of our podcast.

00:28.940 --> 00:31.500
Yes, we've been doing this a little while.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.380
Of course on our show, if you're brand new to our program, we like to discuss the latest

00:34.380 --> 00:38.780
in video games and gaming culture and, you know, we're three gamers that all met playing

00:38.780 --> 00:43.760
DDR at an arcade and we've known each other for about five years doing this program and

00:43.760 --> 00:44.760
just kind of like to give our share.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.340
And of course it's all about what you guys have to say as well and you can always interact

00:47.340 --> 00:52.400
with our program through the chat room or through our Skype line or, you know, our voicemail

00:52.400 --> 00:53.400
or mailbag.

00:53.400 --> 00:57.260
You can always send us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com because if we can do

00:57.260 --> 01:00.220
a show, if any old idiots like us can do a show, then you guys should be able to be a

01:00.220 --> 01:01.440
part of it as well.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.260
So anyhow, let's get back into the gaming news.

01:03.260 --> 01:06.300
Started off with some talk about Mario Kart coming out on the Wii.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.460
There's some brand new details about Mario Kart on the Wii.

01:10.460 --> 01:14.220
Apparently a couple of screenshots, new screenshots actually hit the internet this week and so

01:14.220 --> 01:16.780
it gives some more details about what's going on.

01:16.780 --> 01:21.300
Of course the tracks appear to be bigger and better as you would expect on a new console.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.000
You can do jumps, little jumps again.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.260
The jump button is back.

01:24.260 --> 01:29.940
Twelve player racing online, shortcuts within the tracks as well, mid-air stunts apparently

01:29.940 --> 01:34.020
can be done in the game as well, and tracks being carried over from Mario Kart Double

01:34.020 --> 01:39.440
Dash which is cool because some of the classic tracks of course have awesome design in them.

01:39.440 --> 01:43.100
So I'd like to see the old school Rainbow Road come back one more time because I wasn't

01:43.100 --> 01:46.540
as big of a fan of the new school Rainbow Road since the old one.

01:46.540 --> 01:50.620
Mario Kart 64 I think was probably one of the best.

01:50.620 --> 01:51.620
I love Mario Kart 64.

01:51.620 --> 01:55.780
That's one of the few Nintendo 64 games I really, really adore which by the way I forgot

01:55.780 --> 02:00.020
to say in part A during my gaming week, I played F-Zero 64.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.020
I didn't care for it.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.860
I know Jamie you said you loved that one.

02:02.860 --> 02:03.860
I didn't really care for it.

02:03.860 --> 02:09.900
I do see though now where a lot of like GX, the GameCube one came from because it totally

02:09.900 --> 02:16.720
feels like an earlier version of F-Zero GX but I thought Mario Kart 64 was a way better

02:16.720 --> 02:21.180
racer on the Nintendo 64 than F-Zero sadly.

02:21.180 --> 02:25.620
Which makes me sad because I love my F-Zero but oh well.

02:25.620 --> 02:31.180
Anyhow, anyways some interesting news in the homebrew scene on the Wii.

02:31.180 --> 02:35.700
Apparently if you have a mod chipped Wii, they have just enabled it to be able to play

02:35.700 --> 02:42.540
DVDs as if you really need to do that but in case you're interested, what you can do

02:42.540 --> 02:49.860
is actually using a I guess clone CD like some special boot CD that you create.

02:49.860 --> 02:57.940
You'll boot it with your Wii that's got, I guess it's a mod that's programmed in YO Assembly

02:57.940 --> 03:03.940
1.8 and I guess they use this program called Wii Boss and then what you do is you just

03:03.940 --> 03:07.820
mount the disc and pop in the DVD.

03:07.820 --> 03:13.420
So you get to play it using the Wii Remote of course as the remote for it.

03:13.420 --> 03:16.220
I don't know, it's kind of gimmicky, kind of cool.

03:16.220 --> 03:20.140
Definitely something that they can implement later on since it looks like the Wii is fully

03:20.140 --> 03:23.540
capable of course playing DVD movies.

03:23.540 --> 03:27.020
There has to be some sort of functionality already built in that they're going to release

03:27.020 --> 03:29.100
something for later.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.960
Seems so weird how Nintendo does that.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.460
They love to do these time release things on their consoles.

03:33.460 --> 03:37.740
Like you know DS, surprise it goes online, surprise it has voice chat, surprise.

03:37.740 --> 03:38.740
It's just interesting.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.900
Nintendo has some very interesting strategies sometimes.

03:41.900 --> 03:47.260
Well I think that as a company they're very far seen.

03:47.260 --> 03:53.020
They look at the big picture, they have a vision and stick to it.

03:53.020 --> 03:59.740
Well there was speculation on this article by Gizmodo, they were saying that possibly

03:59.740 --> 04:04.740
later on since the whole issue was DVD licensing fees, I guess the license, the technology

04:04.740 --> 04:11.060
to play back DVD video, obviously they didn't want to increase the cost of the Wii so which

04:11.060 --> 04:16.940
you could possibly do later on is get a DVD channel for your Wii downloaded off of Wiiware

04:16.940 --> 04:21.620
and then you pay the money for the licensing fee up front, there you go, pop that in and

04:21.620 --> 04:22.620
you can play DVDs.

04:22.620 --> 04:26.620
Well AZHP brings up an interesting point in our chat room.

04:26.620 --> 04:29.900
There can't be anything already in the Wii that can play DVDs because they need to buy

04:29.900 --> 04:32.340
the licensing to include that software.

04:32.340 --> 04:37.140
It's not legal for them to add in DVD compatibility and time release it.

04:37.140 --> 04:38.940
Interesting.

04:38.940 --> 04:44.460
The son and dad said the Dreamcast was going to have DVD playback but it never happened.

04:44.460 --> 04:51.020
I still don't think there's any problem because really the DVD, the audio and video, really

04:51.020 --> 04:55.380
that's just a particular file and if the Wii is already set up to read those types of files

04:55.380 --> 05:02.380
then having specific DVD playability in the Wii is not the issue.

05:02.380 --> 05:04.100
It was not made with that intent.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.940
It would just be able to read those files already.

05:06.940 --> 05:10.220
It needs the software, I think.

05:10.220 --> 05:16.060
RossDielUT says what a thinly veiled attempt to justify pirate mod chips since hey it plays

05:16.060 --> 05:17.060
DVDs.

05:17.060 --> 05:20.340
Oh and by the way you can play copied games.

05:20.340 --> 05:21.340
Interesting thought.

05:21.340 --> 05:26.980
Nintendo's always, well this whole thing that surprised me about modding the Wii and about

05:26.980 --> 05:32.620
their import policy with it is that they never I guess really cared that much in the past

05:32.620 --> 05:38.620
given that in every other system except the GameCube it was all a physical lockout.

05:38.620 --> 05:44.940
At least with the TurboGrafx it was a difference in the pin sets on the HuCards.

05:44.940 --> 05:46.800
There was no real good converter.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.940
I have the one that was supposed to be the best.

05:48.940 --> 05:49.940
It doesn't work.

05:49.940 --> 05:56.540
Except with the CD games there was no country coding but there were still new CD games but

05:56.540 --> 06:02.580
I don't see exactly why they're as all up in arms on this when Sony's like hey you

06:02.580 --> 06:07.780
can play them here.

06:07.780 --> 06:13.580
It's kind of an old debate at this point for me but you know I think everything should

06:13.580 --> 06:14.580
be region free.

06:14.580 --> 06:18.600
I don't understand the intent to region lock things especially I mean I can understand

06:18.600 --> 06:21.840
because the DVD licensing you have to region lock things but with the Wii if you don't

06:21.840 --> 06:23.820
have DVD playback you don't need to region lock things.

06:23.820 --> 06:27.020
I don't think you have to region lock everything with DVDs and stuff.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.020
Look at the...

06:28.020 --> 06:29.020
Unless it's porn.

06:29.020 --> 06:35.660
PlayStation 3, granted it's Blu-ray but that's region free, the PSP is region free, DS is

06:35.660 --> 06:40.020
region free, Game Boy Advance is region free.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.420
I don't see what the point is.

06:41.420 --> 06:45.660
If anything you're going to be selling more copies of games because people are going to

06:45.660 --> 06:49.300
buy like say Oh and Done and then buy Elite Beat Agents.

06:49.300 --> 06:51.300
Hey you sold an extra copy in Japan.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.640
Who cares if they paid money to have it shipped over here.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.200
That's their money.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.340
But you sold an extra copy because of that.

06:57.340 --> 06:59.060
Is that really a bad thing?

06:59.060 --> 07:02.300
And then we're going to get a Ninja Pass but that's another story.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.460
Jay that says Nintendo is a toy company.

07:04.460 --> 07:07.180
They produce toys not DVD players.

07:07.180 --> 07:12.680
GS68 says because if you buy the Japanese version of a game that has a North American

07:12.680 --> 07:16.420
version it could cause problems with your region's market.

07:16.420 --> 07:17.420
Interesting.

07:17.420 --> 07:24.340
All right well if you want to chat with us join our chat room chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com

07:24.340 --> 07:26.340
and give us your two cents.

07:26.340 --> 07:34.540
Well for anybody who is you know still keeping up with anything about the Virtual Console

07:34.540 --> 07:38.060
and the Wii I do have the update for the UK.

07:38.060 --> 07:43.820
As you were saying previously Wave Race 64 is out for a thousand points.

07:43.820 --> 07:48.540
It translated to seven pounds, ten euro.

07:48.540 --> 07:52.660
And well it's Wave Race which I didn't really care for.

07:52.660 --> 08:01.780
We also have Crater Maze from the Turbo Graphics 16, 600 Wii points, 420 pounds, six euro.

08:01.780 --> 08:04.200
And I think that's it.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.900
Some new additions for you folks that like to play the Virtual Console in the UK and

08:07.900 --> 08:11.020
of course we know here in America we get Super Metroid on Monday.

08:11.020 --> 08:12.020
Not sure what else we get with that.

08:12.020 --> 08:14.460
Crater Maze is a weird game.

08:14.460 --> 08:19.080
There's a lot of weird Turbo Graphics games available on the Wii now and Genesis games

08:19.080 --> 08:21.240
as well.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.860
And some weird games coming out for the Playstation 2 very soon.

08:24.860 --> 08:29.620
A brand new accessory is coming out for the Playstation 2 and In2Games is supposed to be

08:29.620 --> 08:32.500
revealing this at the games convention in Leipzig.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.940
It's a Wiimote basically for the Playstation 2.

08:34.940 --> 08:36.140
I probably shouldn't call it that.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.600
It's a motion sensing pad for the Playstation 2.

08:39.600 --> 08:44.180
The games that are going to be coming out for it, Real Play Tennis, Real Play Pool,

08:44.180 --> 08:49.180
Real Play Golf, Real Play Racing, Real Play Bowling, and Real Play Puzzle Spear.

08:49.180 --> 08:52.540
Hmm, I've heard of some of these games before.

08:52.540 --> 08:56.800
The little sensing pad is supposed to emulate tennis rackets, pool cues, golf clubs and

08:56.800 --> 08:59.500
steering wheels amongst others.

08:59.500 --> 09:00.900
Hmm.

09:00.900 --> 09:03.340
I heard a voice of disagreement over there, Loki.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.620
What do you think?

09:04.620 --> 09:05.620
It's gimmicky shit.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.260
That's what it is.

09:07.260 --> 09:11.120
I've seen the pictures of them and it's not what you think.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.580
It's not a game pad per se.

09:13.580 --> 09:15.000
It's not like the Wii Remote.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.100
It actually is something that looks like a tennis racket.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.420
Something that looks like a golf club.

09:19.420 --> 09:20.420
Something that looks like a bowling ball.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.860
And it just has motion sensors in those.

09:22.860 --> 09:30.300
So think, if you will, there was a golf game that came out called, I want to say, Real

09:30.300 --> 09:34.660
Motion Golf or something like that on Playstation 2 and Xbox a while back.

09:34.660 --> 09:37.220
And I don't know.

09:37.220 --> 09:38.980
It's gimmicky shit.

09:38.980 --> 09:44.060
Well, on the other hand, I can't help but feel like I've played these games before.

09:44.060 --> 09:47.340
And when games start feeling unoriginal, I don't know about you guys, but I get a little

09:47.340 --> 09:48.340
bit angsty.

09:48.340 --> 09:50.340
Do you guys get a little bit angsty?

09:50.340 --> 09:51.340
All the time.

09:51.340 --> 09:56.180
That means it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.

09:56.180 --> 10:09.220
Jamie, why don't you start us off?

10:09.220 --> 10:16.060
FU to headaches that develop into nosebleeds.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.060
That's no fun.

10:17.060 --> 10:18.060
No, it's not.

10:18.060 --> 10:20.180
Is that it?

10:20.180 --> 10:24.220
And also an FU to nosebleeds while I'm busy drinking.

10:24.220 --> 10:25.220
Loki.

10:25.220 --> 10:30.740
FU to pompous little jerks that think they can drive their truck around like it's a fucking

10:30.740 --> 10:32.940
race car.

10:32.940 --> 10:33.940
Actually this is funny.

10:33.940 --> 10:37.700
We saw this last night when we were at the movie theater, this dumb ass blowing through

10:37.700 --> 10:42.720
tons of stop signs in the parking lot, driving like 50 miles an hour.

10:42.720 --> 10:47.020
And you know, usually it's like, where the fuck are the cops when you need them?

10:47.020 --> 10:49.340
There just happened to be a cop right when you needed him.

10:49.340 --> 10:50.980
Pulled the bastard over.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.020
It was awesome.

10:52.020 --> 10:54.460
I laughed my ass off.

10:54.460 --> 10:55.460
Good times.

10:55.460 --> 10:57.620
Justice is served.

10:57.620 --> 11:02.380
My FU goes to this weird cavity thing I have in my mouth.

11:02.380 --> 11:06.020
It's not like a tooth cavity, but I think like one of my crowns is coming off or something

11:06.020 --> 11:09.740
and now it's like a cavity and it sucks because it hurts and now I have to go to the dentist

11:09.740 --> 11:14.820
and I hate going to the dentist because I, oh God, the dentist makes you feel so stupid.

11:14.820 --> 11:17.100
I don't know about you guys, but I hate my dentist.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.580
So I hate every single one.

11:18.580 --> 11:20.900
I think it's only been like one dentist I've ever gone to that I ever liked.

11:20.900 --> 11:21.900
He should go to my dentist.

11:21.900 --> 11:22.900
He's very great.

11:22.900 --> 11:23.900
He probably doesn't take my insurance.

11:23.900 --> 11:28.740
FU to my dentist insurance, not letting me go to very many dentists, but I always fall

11:28.740 --> 11:29.740
asleep.

11:29.740 --> 11:30.740
Let's see.

11:30.740 --> 11:31.740
Just FU to the dentist in general.

11:31.740 --> 11:35.460
Not my favorite thing to do.

11:35.460 --> 11:36.460
Okay.

11:36.460 --> 11:37.460
Just kind of following up with the story here.

11:37.460 --> 11:41.060
I know this is really bad radio, but this is what they are.

11:41.060 --> 11:47.700
Those are the controllers for those crappy attachments that they came out with for the

11:47.700 --> 11:48.700
Wii.

11:48.700 --> 11:49.700
That's the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire life.

11:49.700 --> 11:50.700
Except they're not.

11:50.700 --> 11:53.260
They just have like little sensors and shit on them.

11:53.260 --> 11:58.500
So yeah, it's not a whole lot to get excited about, but hey, I mean if you're into that

11:58.500 --> 12:02.460
kind of stuff and you don't want to go out and buy an actual Wii system and you want

12:02.460 --> 12:04.900
to be able to bowl at home and stuff, great.

12:04.900 --> 12:05.900
Buy the game.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.480
It's only like 30 bucks anyway.

12:07.480 --> 12:14.080
So it's not really a Wiimote coming to the PlayStation 2, but it's these Wii-like technologies

12:14.080 --> 12:15.660
coming to the PlayStation 2.

12:15.660 --> 12:19.460
Something like that, yeah.

12:19.460 --> 12:25.940
Now what's also interesting, this kind of leaked out during an online demo for, I believe

12:25.940 --> 12:31.420
it was for another game, during Unreal Tournament 3, they had accidentally paused the game or

12:31.420 --> 12:37.060
something and a gamer card screen popped up that's going to be tied in with home.

12:37.060 --> 12:42.400
And apparently, you know, the PlayStation Network will be getting a similar type of

12:42.400 --> 12:51.480
thing with their home service and my guess is going to be very similar to what Xbox has

12:51.480 --> 12:54.220
right now with their live service.

12:54.220 --> 12:59.100
What's interesting though is, you know, gamer card might sound familiar seeing as there's

12:59.100 --> 13:09.300
that whole my gamer card thing as part of Xbox, so, I don't know, great.

13:09.300 --> 13:13.860
Well, I mean, if it's not broken, why fix it?

13:13.860 --> 13:18.220
It's not the most original idea, but it's good that they're getting something else,

13:18.220 --> 13:19.220
I guess.

13:19.220 --> 13:22.060
Joe, she's 16, says, Sony innovating again.

13:22.060 --> 13:23.060
Brilliant.

13:23.060 --> 13:24.060
Innovation.

13:24.060 --> 13:25.060
Yeah, that's the key word.

13:25.060 --> 13:26.060
All right.

13:26.060 --> 13:27.860
Well, if you guys want to comment on this, we're actually going to open our Skype line

13:27.860 --> 13:29.020
a little bit early tonight.

13:29.020 --> 13:32.900
If you weren't listening to part A, unfortunately, the live stream is getting shut off at 8 p.m.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.940
or so we're being told for some maintenance.

13:34.940 --> 13:38.140
So to make sure that our live listeners get a chance to interact with us tonight before

13:38.140 --> 13:42.580
the plug is pulled on the live stream and we have to finish the show with no live interaction,

13:42.580 --> 13:43.760
we want to open up our Skype line.

13:43.760 --> 13:56.340
So please head on over and give us a call, 1-866-GAME-OLR, I'm sorry, it's 1-866 or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

13:56.340 --> 13:57.340
Get it right, Rob.

13:57.340 --> 14:04.860
Go ahead after this amount of time, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio

14:04.860 --> 14:08.380
on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

14:08.380 --> 14:12.460
So just waiting for a call to come in and we'll take it.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.380
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

14:14.380 --> 14:15.380
Who's this?

14:15.380 --> 14:16.380
Ravenstaufen.

14:16.380 --> 14:17.380
How are you tonight, Sky?

14:17.380 --> 14:18.380
Hi.

14:18.380 --> 14:19.380
Fine.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.380
What's up, Ravenstaufen?

14:20.380 --> 14:21.380
What's on your mind?

14:21.380 --> 14:22.380
Bioshock is on my mind.

14:22.380 --> 14:23.900
God, you've got the quickest dialing finger in the world.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.400
You're always the first one to get through.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.400
It's amazing.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
I do.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.460
I know how to work Skype.

14:28.460 --> 14:31.940
I think it's the new version of Skype or something because it shuts everyone else out once one

14:31.940 --> 14:33.500
person's coming through.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.180
I wish I could go back to the old version.

14:35.180 --> 14:36.900
Anyway, what's on your mind?

14:36.900 --> 14:37.900
Bioshock.

14:37.900 --> 14:44.540
Yeah, but I want to ask you that the mini-game, the hacking mini-game, are you good at that

14:44.540 --> 14:45.540
game?

14:45.540 --> 14:48.620
Rob, you said you didn't do it, didn't you?

14:48.620 --> 14:51.980
I wasn't able to complete it, but I only tried it one time.

14:51.980 --> 14:52.980
It's Pipe Dream.

14:52.980 --> 14:57.260
I think that's what it was, Pipe Dream, or that game on PopCap Games with the little

14:57.260 --> 14:58.260
Chinese fireworks.

14:58.260 --> 15:00.580
I don't remember the name of that game, but it reminded me of both those games.

15:00.580 --> 15:01.700
Yeah, it's real easy.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.420
Here's my trick in the whole thing.

15:03.420 --> 15:06.220
You just flip over all the tiles if you can.

15:06.220 --> 15:07.620
Dude, that's my trick.

15:07.620 --> 15:09.980
Yeah, connect them.

15:09.980 --> 15:11.660
Why wouldn't you want to flip over all the tiles?

15:11.660 --> 15:12.660
I don't know.

15:12.660 --> 15:13.660
Is there a downside to flipping over?

15:13.660 --> 15:14.660
You pay money.

15:14.660 --> 15:15.660
Not that I found out.

15:15.660 --> 15:16.660
You pay money?

15:16.660 --> 15:18.780
Yeah, you know, it's either hacking or pay money.

15:18.780 --> 15:19.780
Oh.

15:19.780 --> 15:20.780
Oh, well, no.

15:20.780 --> 15:23.100
When you're flipping over the tiles, you don't pay money.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.100
No, no, no.

15:24.100 --> 15:27.060
If you lose, then your health goes bad.

15:27.060 --> 15:31.500
You can pay money to just have it automatically hack, or you can do the tile thing, but yeah,

15:31.500 --> 15:34.100
I don't understand why you wouldn't flip over all the tiles.

15:34.100 --> 15:38.260
Yeah, because some people I talk to go like, the game's hard.

15:38.260 --> 15:39.260
This is really hard.

15:39.260 --> 15:43.980
You're supposed to flip over every tile and try to figure out shit.

15:43.980 --> 15:47.020
That seems to kind of defeat the purpose if you just go in there and flip over every tile.

15:47.020 --> 15:50.700
There are some other tiles, though, that are in the actual game.

15:50.700 --> 15:55.020
I'm not sure why, if there's a downside to flipping over tiles.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.260
Maybe that's one of the differences where the demo and the real game are a little different.

15:58.260 --> 16:00.460
I'll have to ask someone I know that already owns the game.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.980
Well, what did you want to say about the hacking, Raven's Dolphin?

16:02.980 --> 16:08.220
Well, you know, yesterday I showed how I can be very good at the hacking.

16:08.220 --> 16:12.260
I showed everyone that I can get it done quite quickly, and they went like, oh, it's very

16:12.260 --> 16:13.260
hard.

16:13.260 --> 16:15.820
I went like, it's not hard, and I showed them that it's not hard.

16:15.820 --> 16:19.380
And what did they do, were they calling you names because you just flipped over every

16:19.380 --> 16:20.380
tile?

16:20.380 --> 16:21.380
That was your trick, or what?

16:21.380 --> 16:25.260
No, they just went like, I can never get through the hacking, like the little mini-game.

16:25.260 --> 16:27.020
I'm like, I'm going to show you how to get through it.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.980
Well, I believe in the full version of the game you're supposed to be able to hack the

16:29.980 --> 16:30.980
vending machines.

16:30.980 --> 16:32.540
There's other stuff you can hack, too.

16:32.540 --> 16:34.740
Yeah, there's other things that hack in the game.

16:34.740 --> 16:35.740
Can't wait for it, though.

16:35.740 --> 16:37.340
Yeah, are you excited about Bioshock?

16:37.340 --> 16:41.780
Yeah, but the thing about, there's an interesting story about this game for me.

16:41.780 --> 16:44.540
I can't remember pre-ordering it at all.

16:44.540 --> 16:49.100
And EB says I have a pre-order for it, so someone must like me.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.140
You think somebody went in there and put a pre-order down for you?

16:52.140 --> 16:53.140
I don't know.

16:53.140 --> 16:57.020
I just can't remember for the life of me why I have a pre-order for it.

16:57.020 --> 16:59.940
All right, well, one more thing, Rayman's Dolphin?

16:59.940 --> 17:02.300
Yeah, there was one more thing.

17:02.300 --> 17:07.980
When you, this is about Bioshock, when you first saw Rapture, would your jaw on the floor,

17:07.980 --> 17:10.180
like that can't be right?

17:10.180 --> 17:14.660
Like when you first go down into the city of, the city?

17:14.660 --> 17:19.820
Yeah, when you see the crab and then you see the beautiful city, did your jaw just go,

17:19.820 --> 17:21.980
oh my god?

17:21.980 --> 17:22.980
Kind of.

17:22.980 --> 17:26.260
I was already, like, just in that very first scene where you're in the ocean with all the

17:26.260 --> 17:29.180
fire everywhere, kind of like how Loki said at the beginning of the show, like some people

17:29.180 --> 17:30.540
just turn around and look at the fire for them.

17:30.540 --> 17:31.700
It'll make a good movie.

17:31.700 --> 17:35.740
That was more, that's what I was thinking, is that, like, it's totally set up like a

17:35.740 --> 17:36.740
movie.

17:36.740 --> 17:40.980
That's what gets, that is what has a lot of people really sucked into this game, is they've

17:40.980 --> 17:45.500
really pulled it off, making it just like a movie, and 2K to some extent did this with

17:45.500 --> 17:49.380
their last game, Prey, which I actually talked about on this program a lot, and it was actually

17:49.380 --> 17:53.980
a first person shooter I really liked, was Prey, because it was set up for dummies like

17:53.980 --> 17:54.980
me.

17:54.980 --> 17:55.980
You could never die in Prey.

17:55.980 --> 17:57.260
I loved it.

17:57.260 --> 18:02.020
For the hardcore FPS fan, they hated it, but it was also set up very much like a movie,

18:02.020 --> 18:04.960
but I don't know, Bioshock pulls it off in a different way that's much more engrossing

18:04.960 --> 18:06.860
than even Prey.

18:06.860 --> 18:07.860
One last thing.

18:07.860 --> 18:08.860
Of course.

18:08.860 --> 18:09.860
Next gen flushing.

18:09.860 --> 18:12.980
I enjoyed flushing the toilet and see it actually going down.

18:12.980 --> 18:15.140
Which way did it spin?

18:15.140 --> 18:16.140
Which way did it flush?

18:16.140 --> 18:17.140
Dr. Clockwise.

18:17.140 --> 18:18.140
Oh.

18:18.140 --> 18:21.820
That's a good question, because it is the bottom of the ocean, so the question, because

18:21.820 --> 18:24.780
this city is supposed to exist at the bottom of the ocean, so the question is, does it

18:24.780 --> 18:25.780
spin a different way?

18:25.780 --> 18:26.780
But what part of the world was it in?

18:26.780 --> 18:27.780
I don't know.

18:27.780 --> 18:32.820
I complained, I said that, you know, now we have next gen flushing, and this is next generation.

18:32.820 --> 18:33.820
Flushing and water.

18:33.820 --> 18:36.260
You could flush the toilet in Duke Nukem 3D.

18:36.260 --> 18:38.620
You could flush the toilets in Final Fantasy VI.

18:38.620 --> 18:40.340
But not like this.

18:40.340 --> 18:42.780
You can't just go up to it and just flush it.

18:42.780 --> 18:47.940
If you go in the bathroom in the palace, you can kneel on the toilet.

18:47.940 --> 18:49.780
I guess that's the problem.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.140
And you move off of it and it flushes.

18:52.140 --> 18:53.140
Really?

18:53.140 --> 18:55.060
So do all the boys sit when they pee?

18:55.060 --> 18:56.940
It's everybody kneels on the toilet.

18:56.940 --> 19:00.380
But you can also flush them in Animal Crossing too if you sit on them like a child.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.820
You guys are very bored.

19:02.820 --> 19:06.420
You know, I have to say, that certainly lets you know that the creators of the game have

19:06.420 --> 19:11.740
gotten it down to every last freaking detail when the toilet flushes and everything.

19:11.740 --> 19:15.500
The fact that you can run around and eat all the food and smoke all the cigarettes, and

19:15.500 --> 19:17.860
apparently you can also play the guitars in the game.

19:17.860 --> 19:22.660
Holy Shonen in chat says, LOL, the ideal of next gen flushing toilets.

19:22.660 --> 19:26.260
Gold Banjo says, OMG, how far technology has taken us.

19:26.260 --> 19:27.460
It's exciting.

19:27.460 --> 19:30.620
I'm feeling very confident about future gaming.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.200
I was just shocked as well.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.200
Just flushing that toilet.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.200
Like, this is it.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.200
This is next gen.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.200
All right.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.060
Well, we're going to let you go for the future so you can go get your copy of Bioshock and

19:39.060 --> 19:40.060
flush all the toilets.

19:40.060 --> 19:41.060
Okay.

19:41.060 --> 19:42.060
All right.

19:42.060 --> 19:43.060
Bye.

19:43.060 --> 19:44.060
Have a good one.

19:44.060 --> 19:45.060
Bye.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.060
I'm sorry.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.060
Next gen has not started until I can take a splicer and give them a swirly in the toilet.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.060
New call.

19:48.060 --> 19:49.060
Hi.

19:49.060 --> 19:50.060
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

19:50.060 --> 19:51.060
Who's this?

19:51.060 --> 19:52.060
Hi.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.500
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.500
Who's this?

19:54.500 --> 19:55.500
Hi.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.500
It's ADHP.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.500
Hello.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.500
There you are.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.500
What's on your mind, buddy?

19:59.500 --> 20:06.340
Oh, well, I remember last show when you guys said that you didn't think Take-Two or Rockstar

20:06.340 --> 20:10.340
was doing that badly because they're the makers of Grand Theft Auto.

20:10.340 --> 20:11.340
Yeah.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.340
Yeah.

20:12.340 --> 20:17.820
Actually, they've been doing a lot of restructuring because they have really bad money management

20:17.820 --> 20:20.300
because of the whole hot coffee incident.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.440
They poured millions of dollars down that.

20:22.440 --> 20:23.940
They're actually way down.

20:23.940 --> 20:27.900
Yeah, and especially the fact that they don't really have anything new coming out this year

20:27.900 --> 20:30.780
now also kind of has to hurt them a little bit.

20:30.780 --> 20:32.540
Yeah, definitely.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.820
So yeah.

20:34.820 --> 20:37.340
Is that all you want to comment on or is there other stuff tonight?

20:37.340 --> 20:39.980
Well, I don't know.

20:39.980 --> 20:44.860
I didn't really get into the feed until after part B and part B wasn't that long.

20:44.860 --> 20:45.860
Oh, all right.

20:45.860 --> 20:49.420
Well, I know because we have to make sure we get the Skype in before eight o'clock tonight,

20:49.420 --> 20:52.220
but our podcast will still have everything in it, all the stories and everything.

20:52.220 --> 20:54.060
Well, what games have you been playing this week?

20:54.060 --> 20:57.460
I've been playing a lot of Half-Life 2, actually.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.460
Yeah.

20:58.460 --> 21:01.740
Because I just got a new computer and I got this headset just so I could Skype in and

21:01.740 --> 21:02.740
call you guys.

21:02.740 --> 21:03.740
Awesome.

21:03.740 --> 21:04.740
Cool.

21:04.740 --> 21:05.740
Thank you.

21:05.740 --> 21:06.740
Yeah.

21:06.740 --> 21:08.940
So wait, you brought a brand new computer, so is it like a top of the line or is it like

21:08.940 --> 21:11.420
a Costco computer or what?

21:11.420 --> 21:12.500
It's kind of a budget computer.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.260
It's like a Dell 600 bucks.

21:14.260 --> 21:18.380
I was like, eh, I want something that plays games, but I don't want something that will

21:18.380 --> 21:19.380
kill my wallet.

21:19.380 --> 21:21.780
So you probably won't be playing Bioshock on it.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.980
Ah, man, I wish I could.

21:23.980 --> 21:26.340
Do you have a 360?

21:26.340 --> 21:29.420
No, I just have a Wii for now.

21:29.420 --> 21:35.980
I'm not getting into the next gen until they fix the stability issues on the Xbox 360.

21:35.980 --> 21:40.020
You know, actually, Ross Steele kind of brings up a follow-up point in the chat room.

21:40.020 --> 21:44.540
Ross Steele, UT, says, as far as take two, because 2K is a part of that, and says they

21:44.540 --> 21:49.460
almost have nothing other than GTA, Bioshock might be their first post-GTA hit.

21:49.460 --> 21:52.700
So maybe they do have a game this year that's going to bring in the money.

21:52.700 --> 21:55.300
I thought it was 2K that was doing Bioshock.

21:55.300 --> 21:59.260
It is 2K that's doing Bioshock, but don't they all roll up in take two?

21:59.260 --> 22:01.780
Take two owns 2K, and they also own Rockstar.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.660
Yeah, so it's just different subsidiaries of take two.

22:04.660 --> 22:05.660
I see.

22:05.660 --> 22:06.660
Interesting.

22:06.660 --> 22:12.540
Yeah, I just wanted to, like, every time a great game comes out for the Xbox 360, I'm

22:12.540 --> 22:15.020
like, man, I wish I had an Xbox 360.

22:15.020 --> 22:19.640
And then I get, you know, hear stories of like, oh man, my Xbox 360 broke just before

22:19.640 --> 22:20.640
this game came out.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.640
What am I going to do?

22:21.640 --> 22:24.340
And I'm like, I don't want to get that anymore.

22:24.340 --> 22:28.580
Well, at least they have the warranty thing, so it's, you know, a little better now.

22:28.580 --> 22:31.180
All right, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

22:31.180 --> 22:32.700
No, that's about it.

22:32.700 --> 22:33.700
All right.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.260
Well, thank you so much for calling, and have a good week, okay?

22:35.260 --> 22:36.260
Yeah, you too.

22:36.260 --> 22:37.260
Thanks.

22:37.260 --> 22:38.260
Have fun with the new computer.

22:38.260 --> 22:39.260
All right, bye.

22:39.260 --> 22:40.260
Bye-bye.

22:40.260 --> 22:42.420
I wonder if he'll be playing World of Warcraft on that computer, because there's a lot of

22:42.420 --> 22:45.180
people who go out and get those budget computers to play World of Warcraft.

22:45.180 --> 22:46.180
We'll see.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.180
We'll take a couple more calls.

22:47.180 --> 22:51.100
If you'd like to give us a call again, the number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.

22:51.100 --> 22:53.900
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

22:53.900 --> 22:56.140
But don't call now, because we have another call on the line right now.

22:56.140 --> 22:58.140
Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

22:58.140 --> 22:59.420
Hey, guys, what's up?

22:59.420 --> 23:00.420
It's Footy Monster.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.420
Hello, Footy Monster.

23:01.420 --> 23:02.420
What's on your mind?

23:02.420 --> 23:03.420
Nothing much.

23:03.420 --> 23:07.220
I actually want to share with you guys something that I learned during the past day, which

23:07.220 --> 23:11.900
is the Hannah Montana game for the DS actually seems to be really good.

23:11.900 --> 23:12.900
What is this?

23:12.900 --> 23:15.380
Hannah Montana, you know, that Disney show?

23:15.380 --> 23:16.620
Wait, wait, wait.

23:16.620 --> 23:19.220
Hannah Montana for the DS is good?

23:19.220 --> 23:20.220
Yes.

23:20.220 --> 23:21.220
This is newsworthy.

23:21.220 --> 23:24.780
It's a platform that's out already, but the one is going to come out soon.

23:24.780 --> 23:27.340
Now, how do you know this?

23:27.340 --> 23:32.860
Because I checked the video that was posted on DS Fanboy on Friday, and basically the

23:32.860 --> 23:38.220
game is like jam sessions for the DS, where you have the guitar, you can strum it and

23:38.220 --> 23:42.900
play chords and stuff, but takes you to the next level where you can not only strum, but

23:42.900 --> 23:48.100
also pick individual strings, and also you get a full drum kit in which you can actually

23:48.100 --> 23:52.940
play like everything on the drum, and a bass guitar, and also you have connectivity with

23:52.940 --> 23:54.740
other DSs, and you can play on Wi-Fi.

23:54.740 --> 23:57.220
Each person takes an instrument, you can jam together, actually.

23:57.220 --> 23:59.620
The chat room is all surprised that you're serious.

23:59.620 --> 24:01.980
I'm serious, completely serious.

24:01.980 --> 24:08.100
It looks like Rock Band meets jam sessions with a really bad IP sticking on the front.

24:08.100 --> 24:09.100
I see.

24:09.100 --> 24:12.460
So Hannah Montana is a music game that looks to be really good, basically.

24:12.460 --> 24:13.460
Yeah, yeah.

24:13.460 --> 24:14.460
It's a music game, yeah.

24:14.460 --> 24:17.540
So it's not good because I don't get to punch her in the face or anything.

24:17.540 --> 24:18.540
That's not what makes it good, right?

24:18.540 --> 24:19.540
Yeah, nothing helps.

24:19.540 --> 24:20.540
It's actually a good game.

24:20.540 --> 24:21.540
Wow.

24:21.540 --> 24:23.180
It seems to be a good game.

24:23.180 --> 24:29.780
I actually called to Bobby Blackpool's show before, and he said that he thinks, or that

24:29.780 --> 24:35.220
he heard, that they might re-release without the IP, like the Hannah Montana IP slapping

24:35.220 --> 24:37.140
to it, like the developers.

24:37.140 --> 24:39.500
That would be hilarious if they did that.

24:39.500 --> 24:43.140
Can you guys think of any other games that were like that, that were actually pretty

24:43.140 --> 24:47.260
good games that just had a crappy brand on it?

24:47.260 --> 24:48.540
I'm trying to think if there's anything else.

24:48.540 --> 24:50.820
I'm like, surely there was something else in gaming history.

24:50.820 --> 24:54.820
Maybe the chat room can think of something like, was there a great concept for a game

24:54.820 --> 24:58.580
or a great game that just got totally screwed by the IP that was attached to it?

24:58.580 --> 24:59.580
Cool Spot.

24:59.580 --> 25:01.820
Oh, Spot, the video game?

25:01.820 --> 25:02.820
Yeah, Cool Spot.

25:02.820 --> 25:05.220
Oh, like all the way back in the NES days?

25:05.220 --> 25:06.220
Super NES.

25:06.220 --> 25:07.860
Oh, I don't remember that one.

25:07.860 --> 25:10.660
I remember the old board game one that was kind of like Othello.

25:10.660 --> 25:15.260
Well, no, this is with the Spot from 7-Up.

25:15.260 --> 25:18.060
There were the Noid games.

25:18.060 --> 25:19.060
The Noid games?

25:19.060 --> 25:20.060
Was any good?

25:20.060 --> 25:21.060
You annoyed yourself.

25:21.060 --> 25:23.460
They were a good waste of time.

25:23.460 --> 25:24.460
Oh!

25:24.460 --> 25:25.460
Vectorman.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.460
Sneak King.

25:26.460 --> 25:27.460
Hello.

25:27.460 --> 25:28.460
We did have one recently.

25:28.460 --> 25:29.460
But actually, I don't know.

25:29.460 --> 25:30.460
The Burger King IP kind of made it, actually.

25:30.460 --> 25:31.460
I don't know.

25:31.460 --> 25:32.460
I wouldn't say that was a bad IP.

25:32.460 --> 25:33.460
But, huh.

25:33.460 --> 25:37.580
And now I'm just curious about if High School Musical 2, the game, is going to be coming

25:37.580 --> 25:38.580
out any soon.

25:38.580 --> 25:39.580
I still have Shane's CD.

25:39.580 --> 25:43.940
Well, High School Musical, the game, just came out in DS last week, and it's coming

25:43.940 --> 25:48.220
out, the karaoke games coming out on Playstation 2 and Wii in November.

25:48.220 --> 25:53.580
All I have to do is go to Disneyland and then run away from them while they chase me.

25:53.580 --> 25:55.500
So Footy Monster, I'm just shocked.

25:55.500 --> 25:58.660
A very unlikely recommendation for Hannah Montana, but you know what?

25:58.660 --> 26:02.740
I guess this will truly put people to the test.

26:02.740 --> 26:07.140
Is a good game a good game a good game no matter what?

26:07.140 --> 26:13.300
And if you remember, though, they do have that special Disney, like Xbox Live-type service

26:13.300 --> 26:16.900
that's starting with the Hannah Montana 2 game, too.

26:16.900 --> 26:21.980
I just posted the link to the story and the video in chat, so just check it out for yourselves.

26:21.980 --> 26:25.380
I mean, really, it's like I can tell you Hannah Montana seems to be a good game and

26:25.380 --> 26:29.340
you're probably going to laugh at me, but once you see that, I actually look at people's

26:29.340 --> 26:33.380
reaction in the chat room before and it's like, I can't believe that he's right.

26:33.380 --> 26:35.180
It looks to be pretty cool.

26:35.180 --> 26:38.820
The fact that you can actually jam, like, if it was Rock Band, it's like people said

26:38.820 --> 26:43.060
it's jam sessions for the DS mixed with Rock Band with a crap IP.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.380
And how the fuck did Hannah Montana get her name on this?

26:45.380 --> 26:46.380
That's what I want to know.

26:46.380 --> 26:50.740
I'm looking at this right now, so wait, I'm going to play this little video here just

26:50.740 --> 26:51.740
because I can.

26:51.740 --> 26:56.100
And this is coming from DS Fanboy.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.100
So where's this video?

26:57.100 --> 26:58.900
Oh, it's going to stream a lot here.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.060
Let me take a little bit.

27:00.060 --> 27:02.780
It's not going to be good.

27:02.780 --> 27:07.460
It's kind of stupid, like, I don't know why the person doesn't really show the game screen

27:07.460 --> 27:08.460
that much.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.460
They show the guy talking.

27:09.460 --> 27:10.460
Yeah, I know.

27:10.460 --> 27:15.900
I just want to see the screen, but they show the screen a couple of times and you can get

27:15.900 --> 27:17.180
the feel of the game.

27:17.180 --> 27:22.460
You can record up to two minutes, even if you're playing Wi-Fi, so you can actually

27:22.460 --> 27:28.020
record two minutes of something if you're recording with your buddies and that kind

27:28.020 --> 27:29.020
of thing.

27:29.020 --> 27:35.020
So it seems to be pretty feature complete, which is kind of impressive.

27:35.020 --> 27:37.740
Son of Dad says the license kills this game.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.500
No hardcore gamer will buy this.

27:40.500 --> 27:43.100
I will buy it.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.100
You dare to defy.

27:44.100 --> 27:45.100
What son of Dad?

27:45.100 --> 27:47.460
Well, here's the best part, though.

27:47.460 --> 27:54.180
If it's a game like this where it's not going to be that popular, it means it'll just be

27:54.180 --> 27:58.060
in a bargain bin pretty quick and then you can pick it up.

27:58.060 --> 28:01.780
But it might be popular because of the fact that, oh, he's like strumming the little guitar

28:01.780 --> 28:03.780
with the DS thing.

28:03.780 --> 28:08.660
You have actual strings and you can either pick the whole thing or just each string in

28:08.660 --> 28:12.060
itself and use the feedback-selected ports.

28:12.060 --> 28:13.060
Very interesting.

28:13.060 --> 28:15.220
Talk about gaming gems in the strangest places.

28:15.220 --> 28:18.660
I mean, wow, there's little drums, too.

28:18.660 --> 28:19.660
That is something else.

28:19.660 --> 28:22.420
I might have to check that out.

28:22.420 --> 28:26.340
Real quickly before we let you go, I know you also co-host a podcast about strictly

28:26.340 --> 28:28.480
role-playing games, right?

28:28.480 --> 28:29.480
That is correct.

28:29.480 --> 28:30.980
Am I allowed to plug it?

28:30.980 --> 28:32.980
Yes, you may plug it.

28:32.980 --> 28:38.500
All right, The Ultimate Quest, you can find it on UltimateQuest.net and the next show

28:38.500 --> 28:41.740
is probably going to be released in the next few days, so yeah, there you go.

28:41.740 --> 28:45.460
Well, what I want to ask you about Ultimate Quest, I know Blue Dragon is coming out very

28:45.460 --> 28:46.460
soon.

28:46.460 --> 28:47.460
Are you excited about this?

28:47.460 --> 28:49.620
Because it's been getting some mixed reception from people.

28:49.620 --> 28:53.140
I would be excited about it if it wasn't for two reasons.

28:53.140 --> 28:58.420
First off, one of the other co-hosts on the show, Jack Ransom, Shadow Slayer, better known,

28:58.420 --> 29:04.580
he actually played the demo and also did Xenocore, and they both agree that it's really nice

29:04.580 --> 29:08.420
looking, it's something that 360 doesn't really have any access, which is like a traditional

29:08.420 --> 29:13.660
RPG, but that's it.

29:13.660 --> 29:18.140
So that the whole thing that they look really like little kids will put off any hardcore

29:18.140 --> 29:22.260
360 game and things that don't have a 360, so whatever.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.260
All right, we'll see.

29:23.260 --> 29:26.540
All right, anyway, we've had John for a long time, so we got to let you go, but thanks

29:26.540 --> 29:29.660
so much for the call and for the tip on Hannah Montana, who would have known?

29:29.660 --> 29:30.660
Yeah, no worries.

29:30.660 --> 29:33.380
I got to spread the Montana love with this whole thing.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.380
Take care.

29:34.380 --> 29:35.380
Have a good flight.

29:35.380 --> 29:36.380
I understand you have a 14-hour flight tomorrow, so have a good flight.

29:36.380 --> 29:37.380
All right.

29:37.380 --> 29:38.380
Thanks a lot, man.

29:38.380 --> 29:39.380
All right.

29:39.380 --> 29:40.380
Bye-bye.

29:40.380 --> 29:41.380
See you.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.380
See you.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.380
See you.

29:43.380 --> 29:44.380
He's breaking up a little bit there at the end, too, so it's probably for the best.

29:44.380 --> 29:45.380
We'll take one more call.

29:45.380 --> 29:46.380
One more call.

29:46.380 --> 29:47.380
Why not?

29:47.380 --> 29:52.900
If anybody else decides to call in, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number, or our username on Skype

29:52.900 --> 29:55.260
is OrangeLoungeRadio.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.260
Waiting for it.

29:56.260 --> 29:57.700
Oh, give it a second because of the buffer.

29:57.700 --> 30:01.140
I'm trying to see what else is going on in chat here.

30:01.140 --> 30:02.140
Let's see.

30:02.140 --> 30:07.620
Joshi16 says he's pimping Montana out on the streets.

30:07.620 --> 30:12.780
Footy is back in chat saying that game will rock everybody's socks.

30:12.780 --> 30:13.780
Looks interesting, though.

30:13.780 --> 30:20.100
They've got some good screenshots on IGN or something, and it's got a little too much

30:20.100 --> 30:23.460
sparkles and pink for my taste, but I don't know.

30:23.460 --> 30:27.260
I like that idea, though, that maybe the developers will release the game without the Hannah Montana

30:27.260 --> 30:29.180
IP, like it's a different game.

30:29.180 --> 30:33.380
Hitstun says you could say the GBA Astro Boy was brought down a little by its license.

30:33.380 --> 30:35.380
The original Astro Boy is hard to watch.

30:35.380 --> 30:36.700
I'm talking about IPs.

30:36.700 --> 30:39.580
All right, well, unfortunately, there's no other calls coming on the Skype line for right

30:39.580 --> 30:45.020
now, so we're going to go back to the news, and just so you know, the live listeners,

30:45.020 --> 30:47.580
Live 365 may dump the show at any time.

30:47.580 --> 30:49.980
Unfortunately, it will be inevitable.

30:49.980 --> 30:53.380
We'll just have to keep going, but we're going to keep recording tonight's show, and

30:53.380 --> 30:56.420
of course, you'll be able to hear the full thing and anything you might miss because

30:56.420 --> 31:01.140
of the Live 365 dump tonight, you can certainly hear it on our podcast, which you can download,

31:01.140 --> 31:03.420
of course, at orangelandtraded.com.

31:03.420 --> 31:06.260
We would have done the mailbag segment right now, but unfortunately, we didn't get a whole

31:06.260 --> 31:10.680
lot of emails, but if you do want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelandtraded.com.

31:10.680 --> 31:13.900
If you wanted to maybe call in tonight and get the chance to, you could always send us

31:13.900 --> 31:16.340
an email, and Dark Soccer always reads through the emails.

31:16.340 --> 31:17.740
But not this week.

31:17.740 --> 31:22.080
Yes, and let us know what you think about Hannah Montana, the game, especially because

31:22.080 --> 31:25.160
I know there's a lot of music gaming fans that listen to this program because of our

31:25.160 --> 31:28.840
history that we did, obviously, a lot with music games in the past.

31:28.840 --> 31:34.300
This is a very interesting, I think a lot of people have said in the past, DDR is starting

31:34.300 --> 31:36.880
to look more and more like a game for little girls.

31:36.880 --> 31:41.180
This doesn't help the music gaming genre break out of that stereotype.

31:41.180 --> 31:46.780
Alright, well let's get back into some gaming news and talk about, we were talking a lot

31:46.780 --> 31:51.380
before we went to Skype about how Sony is kind of getting all these ideas from other

31:51.380 --> 31:52.380
places.

31:52.380 --> 31:55.740
At least it seems like, it feels like, and this story certainly doesn't help.

31:55.740 --> 31:56.740
You remember Afrika?

31:56.740 --> 31:57.740
Afrika!

31:57.740 --> 31:58.740
Afrika!

31:58.740 --> 31:59.740
Afrika!

31:59.740 --> 32:03.460
The game we saw at E3, what, a couple of years ago, that everybody looked at it going, what

32:03.460 --> 32:04.460
the fuck is that?

32:04.460 --> 32:06.380
Well, we still don't know what the fuck that is.

32:06.380 --> 32:07.540
Is it Jamba Safari?

32:07.540 --> 32:08.820
If so, that's fucking rad.

32:08.820 --> 32:11.380
I'm gonna harpoon me and Gazelle.

32:11.380 --> 32:14.700
But apparently the developer said you do not get to attack the animals in Afrika.

32:14.700 --> 32:15.700
Aww.

32:15.700 --> 32:19.940
Otherwise they have said nothing about the game, but there are rumors, again I must stress

32:19.940 --> 32:26.220
rumors because I think this sounds like a load of crap, but the rumor is going out saying

32:26.220 --> 32:34.980
that Sony is supposedly going to be releasing a Wii Fit type touch pad to go with Afrika

32:34.980 --> 32:37.820
to make the Safari experience complete.

32:37.820 --> 32:42.900
Now my question is, how in the fuck does that work?

32:42.900 --> 32:46.260
Do you stand on it and then it just like shakes?

32:46.260 --> 32:47.260
It's rhinoceros approach?

32:47.260 --> 32:50.340
That makes no sense to me whatsoever.

32:50.340 --> 32:53.860
That's why I think this was totally pulled out of somebody's butt.

32:53.860 --> 33:00.900
The other thing too that's also suggesting that Afrika is going to be out in like January.

33:00.900 --> 33:04.340
So I don't think so, since we haven't heard anything about it.

33:04.340 --> 33:06.020
And it's Afrika, I mean.

33:06.020 --> 33:08.540
Well, could they delay it to maybe add something in?

33:08.540 --> 33:09.540
I mean, who knows?

33:09.540 --> 33:12.500
Well, it wouldn't be out before the Wii Fit then, now would it?

33:12.500 --> 33:13.500
Alright.

33:13.500 --> 33:18.940
Just kind of always an interesting story, but I do take it with a huge grain of salt.

33:18.940 --> 33:19.940
Yeah.

33:19.940 --> 33:25.060
Something else that's interesting, part of EA's plan to totally dominate everything that

33:25.060 --> 33:33.060
exists in the world, they are now partnering up with Hasbro to release games based on their

33:33.060 --> 33:39.340
favorite properties, including Monopoly, Risk, and Scrabble, as well as toys including G.I.

33:39.340 --> 33:43.580
Joe, Tonka, Nerf, and Littlest Pet Shop.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.100
They're still doing Littlest Pet Shop?

33:45.100 --> 33:48.260
I didn't even realize there was a Littlest Pet Shop.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.260
Yay?

33:49.260 --> 33:56.340
I don't know, Nerf would be kind of neat, like a first person shooter or Nerf game.

33:56.340 --> 33:58.420
I think they actually have had that before.

33:58.420 --> 34:03.220
I'd put that in a category of good for them.

34:03.220 --> 34:08.700
I wonder if this means Monopoly on Xbox Live Arcade, because that's what we really need.

34:08.700 --> 34:09.700
Not in Scrabble.

34:09.700 --> 34:13.820
No, because then people will never stop playing, because a Monopoly game on average takes about

34:13.820 --> 34:14.820
six hours.

34:14.820 --> 34:15.820
Awesome.

34:15.820 --> 34:21.100
Well, at least you can't have someone cheat as the banker.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.100
True.

34:23.100 --> 34:29.700
Speaking of online games, though, Park Associates, who is big for running those studies on online

34:29.700 --> 34:38.580
activities, said that there are 34% of adult users on the internet playing games, as compared

34:38.580 --> 34:44.780
to 29% on YouTube, and 19% on MySpace and Facebook.

34:44.780 --> 34:51.620
So they have shown a 79% growth in online gaming over the year, and only 46% in social

34:51.620 --> 34:53.480
networking.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.140
So we likes our games.

34:55.140 --> 34:56.140
Keep them going.

34:56.140 --> 35:02.960
On top of that, though, I've noticed a lot of online games have that social aspect already

35:02.960 --> 35:03.960
combined with it.

35:03.960 --> 35:09.660
I'll tell you, half the reason I used to play Ragnarok online was on an internet game, but

35:09.660 --> 35:14.700
half the reason I used to play that or some of the web-based ones, like I did Gaia for

35:14.700 --> 35:19.500
a little bit, was just to chat with people.

35:19.500 --> 35:25.380
I totally believe that casual games are as big as sometimes the hardcore gamers forget

35:25.380 --> 35:30.680
to admit, because again, I use the example of walking around in the workplace and looking

35:30.680 --> 35:37.020
at little cubicles, and so many people playing those freaking PopCap games, like Collapse

35:37.020 --> 35:39.140
and what have you.

35:39.140 --> 35:40.380
It's an incredible business.

35:40.380 --> 35:42.140
They're not supposed to be doing that at work.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.380
Well, they do.

35:43.380 --> 35:44.780
They can do it on their breaks.

35:44.780 --> 35:46.140
Wink, wink.

35:46.140 --> 35:47.340
Not on our breaks at my work.

35:47.340 --> 35:48.340
Aw, that's too bad.

35:48.340 --> 35:50.340
We get stabbed in the head.

35:50.340 --> 35:51.340
Really?

35:51.340 --> 35:52.340
Yeah, really.

35:52.340 --> 35:53.340
That sucks.

35:53.340 --> 35:54.340
It's an HR issue.

35:54.340 --> 35:55.340
All right.

35:55.340 --> 35:59.420
Anyway, well, this might be a future HR issue if you're caught playing this game at work.

35:59.420 --> 36:01.840
It's Super Chick Sisters.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.420
You might have heard of this game this week.

36:03.420 --> 36:04.820
It's from PETA.

36:04.820 --> 36:08.540
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released this game called Super Chick Sisters

36:08.540 --> 36:12.260
as part of their website, KentuckyFriedCruelty.com.

36:12.260 --> 36:14.180
I played the game, and you know what?

36:14.180 --> 36:16.620
I got to tell you, it's not bad.

36:16.620 --> 36:20.540
For a little homebrew cook-up title, it's not bad, and it's very tongue-in-cheek.

36:20.540 --> 36:23.980
It's obvious that the people who made the game know a little something about video games,

36:23.980 --> 36:25.500
because basically, here it is.

36:25.500 --> 36:28.780
The premise of the video game, it's kind of like a Mario Brothers rip-off, but instead

36:28.780 --> 36:34.540
of Mario Brothers, you have a little chicken named Nugget.

36:34.540 --> 36:35.540
Which made me laugh.

36:35.540 --> 36:37.420
And then I think Chickadee, I think was the other one.

36:37.420 --> 36:38.420
No, Chick and Nugget.

36:38.420 --> 36:39.420
Was it?

36:39.420 --> 36:40.420
I don't know.

36:40.420 --> 36:41.420
Well, whatever.

36:41.420 --> 36:45.460
So you have these two things, and I guess Mario and Luigi could not rescue Pamela Anderson,

36:45.460 --> 36:52.040
who's dressed as Princess Toadstool or whatever.

36:52.040 --> 36:57.440
She has been kidnapped by the evil Colonel, and Mario and Luigi are suffering from a case

36:57.440 --> 37:01.380
of Wii-itis, they've been playing too much Nintendo Wii, so their hands are broken.

37:01.380 --> 37:07.300
So they can't go rescue, so they have to rely on Chick and Nugget.

37:07.300 --> 37:10.420
So you go through these Mario-type levels, instead of collecting coins, you collect these

37:10.420 --> 37:15.580
little birds, and then they give you little facts about like, did you play it?

37:15.580 --> 37:21.060
I did play it, and I wish more of my Mario Brothers games would have that, hey, did you

37:21.060 --> 37:26.180
know that they chop the piece off of chickens and don't even do anything?

37:26.180 --> 37:29.140
And did you realize that they boil them alive?

37:29.140 --> 37:30.140
That's so horrible.

37:30.140 --> 37:34.420
Did you know that they put chickens in the incinerator and boil them?

37:34.420 --> 37:36.780
I mean, I was just like, this is amazing.

37:36.780 --> 37:42.900
I mean, I'm kind of like- Parking news, KFC tortures chickens.

37:42.900 --> 37:46.780
Part of me wants to invite PETA on this show, even though they are such a controversial

37:46.780 --> 37:50.460
organization, but part of me goes like, why did you do this?

37:50.460 --> 37:52.020
Why did you make a game out of this?

37:52.020 --> 37:54.860
You do realize there are copyright laws out there?

37:54.860 --> 38:03.140
I mean, there's like, they weren't at all trying to say, oh yeah, it's Larry and Barry

38:03.140 --> 38:07.900
or something, but it's Mario and Luigi, and they have Toad in there, and they use the

38:07.900 --> 38:09.740
Wii, and they're not afraid about that.

38:09.740 --> 38:14.300
In fact, at one point, Mario gets beat up for being cruel to turtles.

38:14.300 --> 38:19.140
Oh my god, you played the level three to get that message, I know.

38:19.140 --> 38:24.780
Yeah, level three was Mario gets beat up by the people for ethical treatment of turtles,

38:24.780 --> 38:25.780
or something like that.

38:25.780 --> 38:30.740
I mean, it's very tongue-in-cheek, but it's funny, and it's, you know, whether you agree

38:30.740 --> 38:36.220
or disagree with PETA, it's kind of an interesting way to get their message across, because my

38:36.220 --> 38:38.940
thing, and the thing I would want to ask PETA, and I swear I'm going to send him an email

38:38.940 --> 38:45.020
this week and try to get him on the show, I want to know is, why did they choose to

38:45.020 --> 38:47.320
make a game out of this to get their message?

38:47.320 --> 38:52.100
Is it because they want to get to that stereotype World of Warcraft player who's doing an all-night

38:52.100 --> 38:53.860
raid with a bucket of wings in his lap?

38:53.860 --> 38:55.860
I mean, are they trying to get those guys to think twice?

38:55.860 --> 38:56.860
The game made me hungry.

38:56.860 --> 38:57.860
What is...

38:57.860 --> 39:04.660
I've got a $5 gift certificate to KFC, and I'm thinking about using me to get me some

39:04.660 --> 39:05.660
chicken to stop.

39:05.660 --> 39:06.660
Oh, stop.

39:06.660 --> 39:09.020
Even if you read all about the torturous ways of hate.

39:09.020 --> 39:10.340
This is kind of funny.

39:10.340 --> 39:12.100
I'm kind of digging this game.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.100
It's interesting, isn't it?

39:13.100 --> 39:14.100
I dig already.

39:14.100 --> 39:19.340
All right, so, yeah, DarkTetsuya in chat says, Nintendo will sue.

39:19.340 --> 39:22.460
Frisbee says, this makes me want KFC even more.

39:22.460 --> 39:28.300
Joshi16 says, but if it's for a good cause, they don't have to care about laws and restrictions.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.540
Just look at gross anti-smoking commercials.

39:30.540 --> 39:33.940
But my question is, you know, PETA is a very controversial organization.

39:33.940 --> 39:36.100
There's a lot of anti-PETA sentiment out there.

39:36.100 --> 39:37.300
They may not want their...

39:37.300 --> 39:38.740
Especially, I don't think they gave...

39:38.740 --> 39:42.140
Obviously, they did not give them permission for this stuff.

39:42.140 --> 39:43.520
It's sort of like, what's the business...

39:43.520 --> 39:46.140
Is it Walmart that doesn't allow anybody out front of their store?

39:46.140 --> 39:47.140
No, it's Target.

39:47.140 --> 39:49.460
Target does not allow anybody out front of their store, no matter who they are.

39:49.460 --> 39:50.900
I mean, it could be Girl Scouts or anything.

39:50.900 --> 39:53.140
They do not allow anybody out front of their store.

39:53.140 --> 39:54.460
It's just to be consistent policy.

39:54.460 --> 39:59.340
You know, they don't want their name tied to any, you know, Republican, Democrat initiative

39:59.340 --> 40:00.980
or whatever it is.

40:00.980 --> 40:02.380
So I think it's Target.

40:02.380 --> 40:04.620
I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but, you know...

40:04.620 --> 40:06.460
I sure as hell know it's not Walmart.

40:06.460 --> 40:10.260
Maybe Nintendo wants to be like that where they don't want to be tied to any organization,

40:10.260 --> 40:13.700
and I somehow doubt they were asked about this.

40:13.700 --> 40:20.080
So, WonderDogHerald says, PETA, as usual, likes to appeal to children for their tactics.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.940
People eating tasty animals.

40:21.940 --> 40:22.940
Alright.

40:22.940 --> 40:23.940
Anyways.

40:23.940 --> 40:26.100
If you guys keep saying stuff like that, they're not going to want to come on the show.

40:26.100 --> 40:27.100
I gotta...

40:27.100 --> 40:28.100
I like chicken!

40:28.100 --> 40:29.100
I want to get peed on the show.

40:29.100 --> 40:30.100
Freshly decapitated.

40:30.100 --> 40:33.140
I didn't get the whole pipe level.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.260
That frustrated me, and I turned it off.

40:35.260 --> 40:36.260
Yeah, level 3 was...

40:36.260 --> 40:37.620
I stopped at level 3, too.

40:37.620 --> 40:39.020
It was too hard to figure out.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.020
A little over the top.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.900
Someone needs some better level design.

40:41.900 --> 40:44.820
Again, for a homebrew game, which essentially is, it's not bad.

40:44.820 --> 40:46.820
I mean, it's obvious a lot of effort went into this.

40:46.820 --> 40:51.620
It wasn't... that's what surprised me most about it, is that it wasn't cheaply put together.

40:51.620 --> 40:53.620
That was what I think makes this newsworthy.

40:53.620 --> 40:56.360
It wasn't some dumb, crappy little Flash game.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.220
They actually put a little effort into this, and that's what made it...

40:58.220 --> 41:04.440
The kernel, the spider robot, and someone put in a news article that the kernel wears

41:04.440 --> 41:07.820
a Bowser mask at the end of the game as the spider robot.

41:07.820 --> 41:11.820
So I didn't get that far, but I don't know.

41:11.820 --> 41:12.820
Interesting.

41:12.820 --> 41:19.100
Ubisoft is now talking about a brand new top secret game that they have in development.

41:19.100 --> 41:21.380
That's going to be focusing on user-generated content.

41:21.380 --> 41:25.340
I guess you could kind of compare it to LittleBigPlanet or something of that sort.

41:25.340 --> 41:30.460
Anyways, it will allow gamers to support their creations across platforms, sending out pie

41:30.460 --> 41:35.580
in the sky meters, or it was apparently according to Joyce, it gets sending their pie in the

41:35.580 --> 41:37.380
sky meters off the charts.

41:37.380 --> 41:42.500
But I don't know, great, I think a lot more companies are going to start kind of taking

41:42.500 --> 41:47.460
this stance and allowing more user-created content instead of banning that.

41:47.460 --> 41:53.540
I mean, look at Forza 2 with the whole creating cars, Halo 3 with the new videos that they're

41:53.540 --> 41:54.540
uploading.

41:54.540 --> 41:56.540
Hell, even before that with Burnout.

41:56.540 --> 42:00.380
Revenge where you can upload your gameplay footage and stuff.

42:00.380 --> 42:03.180
Sing Star where you're going to be able to do the same thing.

42:03.180 --> 42:07.460
So something that we're probably going to see more of.

42:07.460 --> 42:14.820
All right, well, Dark Soccer likes to surf the internet up and down every single week

42:14.820 --> 42:18.220
and choose a website of her liking to share with all of you.

42:18.220 --> 42:21.680
And we call it her website of the week, and I'm curious what Dark Soccer has picked out

42:21.680 --> 42:23.220
for the kids this week.

42:23.220 --> 42:32.020
Let's play the music and see.

42:32.020 --> 42:37.780
The website of the week is PETAKillsAnimals.com.

42:37.780 --> 42:38.780
What Rob?

42:38.780 --> 42:41.500
Oh boy, there went our chances of getting PETA on the show.

42:41.500 --> 42:42.500
All right.

42:42.500 --> 42:50.820
It's basically, actually their most recent news were about the recent PETA trial in North

42:50.820 --> 42:53.100
Carolina for animal cruelty.

42:53.100 --> 43:01.260
Basically they had to submit the numbers of the amount of animals that they had actually

43:01.260 --> 43:03.420
killed involved in their research.

43:03.420 --> 43:08.180
They have on their, I actually, I remember some of this from being on Penn & Tiller's

43:08.180 --> 43:09.180
Bullshit recently.

43:09.180 --> 43:12.380
It was a great show by the way.

43:12.380 --> 43:25.020
Where one of the charges on their inventories was for a walk-in freezer that cost $9,370.

43:25.020 --> 43:29.480
So now I'm going to bring up that show because they actually went and did the size of one

43:29.480 --> 43:30.480
of them.

43:30.480 --> 43:34.220
So we're talking about for a walk-in freezer that would cost that much, it would be twice

43:34.220 --> 43:39.620
the size of the room that we're in right now, a bedroom, seeing how much meat you would

43:39.620 --> 43:41.180
store in a walk-in freezer.

43:41.180 --> 43:42.940
What about vegetables?

43:42.940 --> 43:43.940
Well, no.

43:43.940 --> 43:44.940
Vegetables need refrigeration.

43:44.940 --> 43:46.820
That's a lot of frozen peas.

43:46.820 --> 43:52.520
But there was, there's just quite a bit on here about, you know, exactly what they spelled.

43:52.520 --> 43:57.240
The head of PETA is actually on, you know how they say, oh, well don't use this medication

43:57.240 --> 43:59.020
because it was tested on animals?

43:59.020 --> 44:07.580
The head of PETA is actually on insulin that was, the research was done on animal testing

44:07.580 --> 44:11.180
and derived from animal products.

44:11.180 --> 44:12.620
I just thought it was very interesting.

44:12.620 --> 44:18.460
There's pretty much a company run by hypocrites, but it will.

44:18.460 --> 44:21.660
Well I guess we always have to have a counterpoint, every point made on the show, so there you

44:21.660 --> 44:22.660
have it.

44:22.660 --> 44:28.680
All right, anyhow, let's talk a little bit about Squeenix.

44:28.680 --> 44:35.780
We love Squeenix and they are opening their brand new store online on August 20th and

44:35.780 --> 44:38.100
they even have a time, 6 p.m. Pacific time.

44:38.100 --> 44:42.140
There's going to be a brand new online shop opening up and it's supposed to have Squeenix

44:42.140 --> 44:48.860
collectibles, model kits, and clothing accessories, and I wonder if that means buttons or if you'll

44:48.860 --> 44:53.900
be able to buy a full cosplay on the website, that would be pretty awesome.

44:53.900 --> 44:58.040
Probably some of those Final Fantasy XII action figures like the Balthier one which I have

44:58.040 --> 45:01.780
in, because Balthier is very awesome in Final Fantasy XII.

45:01.780 --> 45:05.060
So if you're a Squeenix fan, I'm sure you're going to be hitting up their website on August

45:05.060 --> 45:06.540
20th, 2007.

45:06.540 --> 45:10.420
Unfortunately I don't recall exactly where the website is located, but I'm sure if you

45:10.420 --> 45:15.640
go to Squeenix's website at Squeenix.com, there'll be a link right there when the store

45:15.640 --> 45:16.640
opens.

45:16.640 --> 45:18.780
So be on the lookout for it.

45:18.780 --> 45:26.000
Well if in case you're wondering what those large hard drives are for on the PlayStation

45:26.000 --> 45:28.740
3, well wonder no more.

45:28.740 --> 45:36.540
Actually they are going to be releasing a digital tuner for recording TV and it's supposed

45:36.540 --> 45:40.760
to be unveiled at Lipzig here pretty soon.

45:40.760 --> 45:48.420
So this has been confirmed by 3Speech, their semi-official blog for Sony.

45:48.420 --> 45:59.780
All right, well in other news, they are talking about the chip manufacturers that are behind

45:59.780 --> 46:01.860
the Wii shortage.

46:01.860 --> 46:06.580
Nintendo wants to up production from what I'm understanding, but they are not able to

46:06.580 --> 46:10.300
get the chips they need still.

46:10.300 --> 46:14.900
The ones who are making the components are saying that if it keeps up like that, they're

46:14.900 --> 46:18.540
not going to be able to keep up with the demand.

46:18.540 --> 46:23.180
Hmm, I'm not surprised.

46:23.180 --> 46:31.140
All right, well talking about Electronic Arts for a minute, going on over to Macintosh gaming,

46:31.140 --> 46:35.540
you know Mac sometimes gets a bad rap because they don't really have a lot of games on it,

46:35.540 --> 46:39.620
but you might have heard early in the year EA is supposed to be kind of helping out a

46:39.620 --> 46:40.980
little bit more.

46:40.980 --> 46:45.220
And EA has actually shipped four games for the Macintosh.

46:45.220 --> 46:50.060
They've shipped Battlefield 2142, Need for Speed Carbon, Harry Potter and the Order of

46:50.060 --> 46:53.360
the Phoenix, and Command and Conquer 3, Tiberium Wars.

46:53.360 --> 46:56.200
So for those of you saying there are no games available on the Mac, well there's four pretty

46:56.200 --> 46:58.860
big titles right there, especially Command and Conquer 3, a lot of people love their

46:58.860 --> 46:59.940
Command and Conquer.

46:59.940 --> 47:00.940
So there you have it.

47:00.940 --> 47:04.320
In fact, I got a message earlier this week online asking if I played Command and Conquer

47:04.320 --> 47:06.980
and if I wanted to play and I said no, you'd have to ask the Loki because I don't really

47:06.980 --> 47:07.980
play that.

47:07.980 --> 47:08.980
No, no, Command and Conquer 3.

47:08.980 --> 47:09.980
So there you have it.

47:09.980 --> 47:10.980
I didn't play it though.

47:10.980 --> 47:11.980
Anyways, let's see.

47:11.980 --> 47:22.220
I was going to say there's been some interesting stuff going on in the whole EA Wikipedia article

47:22.220 --> 47:23.220
there.

47:23.220 --> 47:28.700
Apparently some EA staffers have been changing a little bit of history on there, removing

47:28.700 --> 47:34.940
key facts about their company, some stuff that they may not be too proud of, and it's

47:34.940 --> 47:35.940
been pretty interesting.

47:35.940 --> 47:44.380
They've actually traced back the IP address used to make those changes back to EA.

47:44.380 --> 47:54.340
And I guess they've been responsible for one-third of the changes made on there of the 1351 changes.

47:54.340 --> 47:55.660
Those are from EA.

47:55.660 --> 48:00.940
And of course, many of those though have been reversed by the Wikipedia community.

48:00.940 --> 48:08.180
EA did come out and say they've actually, they sometimes update websites with info about

48:08.180 --> 48:10.220
company games and employees.

48:10.220 --> 48:14.780
For example, EA has sent a correction to Yahoo Finance when they had misspelled the name

48:14.780 --> 48:17.000
of an EA executive.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.420
Many companies routinely post updates on websites like Wikipedia to ensure accuracy of their

48:21.420 --> 48:23.220
own corporate information.

48:23.220 --> 48:30.380
However, I think deleting information that is negative about your company's past is not

48:30.380 --> 48:34.300
exactly following that.

48:34.300 --> 48:35.300
It's basically just...

48:35.300 --> 48:36.300
That's poor ethics.

48:36.300 --> 48:39.620
Yeah, it's hiding the bad spots.

48:39.620 --> 48:43.460
Like Wikipedia doesn't allow you to edit an article that's up about yourself, right?

48:43.460 --> 48:47.780
Yeah, in fact that is a major violation.

48:47.780 --> 48:50.720
Like for instance, I don't touch the OLR article.

48:50.720 --> 48:54.140
There is an Orange Orange Radio article on Wikipedia, how it survived this long against

48:54.140 --> 48:58.140
their notability rules, I have no idea, but hey, it's there.

48:58.140 --> 49:00.900
Probably because I guess since we were lucky enough to have the news articles, then there's

49:00.900 --> 49:03.060
been other sources about us, but whatever.

49:03.060 --> 49:06.700
I've never touched the article, although I'm always fascinated reading the updates and

49:06.700 --> 49:09.020
the work that other people have put into it.

49:09.020 --> 49:13.180
But I just won't touch it because I'm like, well that's kind of weird.

49:13.180 --> 49:17.100
Like there's things I want to go fix in it, like some of the shows that aren't on anymore.

49:17.100 --> 49:19.020
I fixed grammatical errors.

49:19.020 --> 49:20.020
Did you?

49:20.020 --> 49:21.020
I guess I have.

49:21.020 --> 49:22.020
I guess that's different.

49:22.020 --> 49:26.740
Grammatical errors is one thing, but I don't touch it because, I don't know, it's weird.

49:26.740 --> 49:28.700
Some folks in chat are saying, you're welcome.

49:28.700 --> 49:29.700
You're welcome.

49:29.700 --> 49:34.340
Joshi16 says, Wikipedia is becoming corporate propaganda machine.

49:34.340 --> 49:35.340
Interesting.

49:35.340 --> 49:36.780
Interesting perspective.

49:36.780 --> 49:39.420
You know, that's not the only Wikipedia thing I read about this week.

49:39.420 --> 49:44.660
I heard that the, was it the ESA supposedly was going onto Wikipedia and had edited some

49:44.660 --> 49:47.500
articles on like abandonware and stuff too, and they were deleting things.

49:47.500 --> 49:49.140
Like there's some IPs traced back.

49:49.140 --> 49:50.900
I want to say I read something about that somewhere.

49:50.900 --> 49:52.780
I think I remember that too, yeah.

49:52.780 --> 49:56.700
So kind of interesting, all this Wikipedia information that's come out this week.

49:56.700 --> 49:57.700
I think ours needs a bit of an update.

49:57.700 --> 49:58.700
I was just looking at it.

49:58.700 --> 50:01.780
Yeah, it probably needs a small update, but I don't want to do it myself.

50:01.780 --> 50:04.460
So maybe a kind listener will go in there and clean it up.

50:04.460 --> 50:06.460
We'll see.

50:06.460 --> 50:09.820
Anyways, let's see.

50:09.820 --> 50:15.520
Well, actually, I had a little bit of news in regards to stuff coming out on the Virtual

50:15.520 --> 50:18.860
Console and the PSP.

50:18.860 --> 50:23.580
There is actually a Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.

50:23.580 --> 50:26.300
It has actually been rated for a Wii release.

50:26.300 --> 50:31.300
And LucasArts is bringing out Indiana Jones to the PSP, tentatively titled as Indiana

50:31.300 --> 50:35.220
Jones 2008, but it's not Lego.

50:35.220 --> 50:39.580
Dude, I wonder if it's based on the old Indiana Jones arcade game.

50:39.580 --> 50:40.580
That game was pretty awesome.

50:40.580 --> 50:41.580
That would be rad.

50:41.580 --> 50:44.900
Well, they did have, was it that Indiana Jones game that was being worked on by LucasArts,

50:44.900 --> 50:46.660
the one that was supposed to be all, you know.

50:46.660 --> 50:48.900
That was the Indiana Jones 2008.

50:48.900 --> 50:54.460
Yeah, but still this could be something like that, or maybe tying in with the new Indiana

50:54.460 --> 50:55.460
Jones movie.

50:55.460 --> 50:56.460
Maybe.

50:56.460 --> 50:57.460
I don't know.

50:57.460 --> 51:00.300
Harrison Ford is too old.

51:00.300 --> 51:01.300
He's never too old.

51:01.300 --> 51:02.300
They'll make him a robot.

51:02.300 --> 51:06.700
Well, I guess if Bruce Willis can do it, Harrison Ford can.

51:06.700 --> 51:11.860
Alright, well, one more story for you guys before we get into some last minute stories

51:11.860 --> 51:12.860
tonight.

51:12.860 --> 51:18.100
Dementium, The War, is a brand new game coming out for the DS, and I think what kind of sets

51:18.100 --> 51:22.480
this apart from most other games is it's kind of like, I guess you could call it like Silent

51:22.480 --> 51:30.980
Hilly, scary, bloody, gross, rated mature for the DS, and it's coming out on Halloween.

51:30.980 --> 51:37.140
October 31st is the release date for this game, Dementium, and it's, I guess it's actually

51:37.140 --> 51:45.500
based off an independent title by Renegade Kid, and Dementium is a mature rated game,

51:45.500 --> 51:50.900
and it looks like it's going to be kind of like, you know, that type Silent Hill horror

51:50.900 --> 51:51.900
type game.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.620
I was actually thinking of the Call of Cthulhu game.

51:54.620 --> 51:59.420
Well, remember they have that one with a touch to the dead a while back that was also a mature

51:59.420 --> 52:04.500
rated title that was more of a shooter, but I think around the same side, Insecticides

52:04.500 --> 52:07.580
was supposed to be coming out on the DS as well, so that one was pretty cool.

52:07.580 --> 52:12.940
That was that adventure game that was kind of film noir, but with insects.

52:12.940 --> 52:17.020
We don't see a lot of survival horror on the DS nonetheless, so kind of interesting.

52:17.020 --> 52:19.020
It looks good.

52:19.020 --> 52:23.220
I haven't seen too much on this game, but I'm always interested in more survival horror

52:23.220 --> 52:26.380
games, because they always succeed in scaring the pants off of me.

52:26.380 --> 52:28.120
So there you have it.

52:28.120 --> 52:31.260
Let's go around and see if there's any last minute stories here in studio.

52:31.260 --> 52:34.940
We would have done the Skype line right now, but of course since we're afraid, I guess

52:34.940 --> 52:36.220
the live listeners are still connected.

52:36.220 --> 52:39.700
It's 805, and the maintenance was supposed to happen at 8 o'clock, but we're still on

52:39.700 --> 52:40.700
air, so.

52:40.700 --> 52:41.700
Breaking news.

52:41.700 --> 52:42.700
We're still here.

52:42.700 --> 52:43.700
I guess so.

52:43.700 --> 52:46.300
We're going to try and keep going until they turn off the lights on us, so let's go around

52:46.300 --> 52:50.060
and get any last minute stories, then we'll open up the Skype line a little longer until

52:50.060 --> 52:51.060
we get booted.

52:51.060 --> 52:53.420
I don't know if any more calls will come in, but we'll see.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.420
Okay.

52:54.420 --> 52:55.420
I've got some last minute stories.

52:55.420 --> 53:02.620
Ninja Gaiden 2 is going to be debuting on the Xbox 360, and with PlayStation 3 coming

53:02.620 --> 53:05.600
later on, it's supposed to debut at Tokyo Game Show.

53:05.600 --> 53:12.360
That is the rumor coming from GameSpot Korea, so it'll be interesting to check that out.

53:12.360 --> 53:19.540
Let's see here, Halo 3 of course nearing completion, almost gold right now, and there's been some

53:19.540 --> 53:25.060
interesting details on this new Bungie Pro program that's going to be happening, and

53:25.060 --> 53:32.420
basically what Bungie Pro is, is it's going to be a, anyone that has a copy of Halo 3

53:32.420 --> 53:38.020
and a gold subscription will be allocated six slots, or 25 megabytes of space to upload

53:38.020 --> 53:40.040
gameplay videos and whatnot.

53:40.040 --> 53:47.480
Now if you decide to purchase Bungie Pro, what you'll get is 250 megabytes across 24

53:47.480 --> 53:52.820
slots and it'll be worth 750 points, which is going to be good for one year, so that's

53:52.820 --> 53:53.820
kind of interesting.

53:53.820 --> 53:59.180
If you're really into your gameplay shots, then that might be something to look forward

53:59.180 --> 54:00.180
to.

54:00.180 --> 54:05.420
Another thing, according to V Jump, there's a scan of some new Hudson Soft games called

54:05.420 --> 54:10.820
Deca Sporta, and it looks kind of like Wii Sports a little bit, they've got, it looks

54:10.820 --> 54:19.940
like Go Kart Racing, they actually have Archery, and it looks like Tennis of course, and Basketball,

54:19.940 --> 54:24.100
so that's kind of cool, oh and Volleyball.

54:24.100 --> 54:30.860
Let's see what else here, Halo the movie has been apparently reconfirmed that it's coming

54:30.860 --> 54:34.060
and is apparently already filming in New Zealand.

54:34.060 --> 54:40.980
Bullshit, yeah that's what I'm thinking too, this is coming from XboxFamily.com, so I don't

54:40.980 --> 54:45.540
believe it, but we'll see, that it?

54:45.540 --> 54:49.700
There's one other thing, I heard some interesting stuff this week, a game I did not realize

54:49.700 --> 54:57.540
was coming out this fall, apparently, was it Kingdom of Fire, Circle of Doom is supposed

54:57.540 --> 55:02.300
to be coming out in early December, I thought that was coming out in 2008.

55:02.300 --> 55:05.860
Speaking of upcoming games, what have you heard about Two Worlds, anything?

55:05.860 --> 55:11.180
It's just like Oblivion, but with online multiplayer as well, you can play quests online with people

55:11.180 --> 55:12.180
to co-op.

55:12.180 --> 55:15.040
I've been curious about that game, very curious, and of course it's coming out the same week

55:15.040 --> 55:19.300
as Bioshock, so it's going to be a tough week, but I actually was very curious about that

55:19.300 --> 55:22.060
game, thinking about picking it up, but I wish there was a demo online or something

55:22.060 --> 55:23.060
like that.

55:23.060 --> 55:26.780
Well let me go this way, apparently it's supposed to be pretty cool, and they've gone to great

55:26.780 --> 55:32.280
details in it, in fact they've actually motion captured bunnies that are in the game, rad!

55:32.280 --> 55:36.260
And the day and night cycles are supposed to be pretty cool, and I don't know, it's

55:36.260 --> 55:42.340
kind of like Oblivion, but it's all third person, and I don't really know much beyond

55:42.340 --> 55:43.340
that.

55:43.340 --> 55:47.540
It looks cool, but I think unfortunately it's coming out the same week as Bioshock.

55:47.540 --> 55:48.580
It would have been a different audience.

55:48.580 --> 55:51.740
It originally was supposed to come out last week, which would have been perfect, because

55:51.740 --> 55:55.740
it's Madden and that, and that would have been a pretty good game to pick up if you're

55:55.740 --> 55:56.740
not into Madden.

55:56.740 --> 55:59.500
Well, but a lot of people aren't into first person shooters either, like I said at the

55:59.500 --> 56:04.300
top of the show, I may think Bioshock is amazing, but I still kind of am first person shooters.

56:04.300 --> 56:07.340
Maybe you can buy Bioshock, I'll buy Two Worlds and we can trade off later, that would be

56:07.340 --> 56:08.340
fun.

56:08.340 --> 56:09.340
I'll see.

56:09.340 --> 56:10.340
Alright.

56:10.340 --> 56:11.580
Jamie, do you have any last minute stories tonight?

56:11.580 --> 56:13.540
I'm actually looking at old games right now.

56:13.540 --> 56:14.960
Looking at old school stuff?

56:14.960 --> 56:15.960
Star Parodia.

56:15.960 --> 56:17.740
Any particular reason?

56:17.740 --> 56:20.860
Because someone mentioned Star Soldier, and I was like no no no no no no, you need to

56:20.860 --> 56:22.860
play Star Parodia.

56:22.860 --> 56:26.700
Only game where you can play as a flying PC Engine, the Vic Viper, or Bomberman in the

56:26.700 --> 56:27.700
same game.

56:27.700 --> 56:31.300
Alright, well I have some very quick last minute news for you guys.

56:31.300 --> 56:36.140
Footy Monster was sending me a link, apparently the Bioshock PC demo is coming out tomorrow

56:36.140 --> 56:39.940
at 7 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, that would be 4 o'clock Pacific.

56:39.940 --> 56:46.380
So the Bioshock PC demo is coming out, this is according to a post from the 2K Games forum,

56:46.380 --> 56:48.500
so it is probably legit.

56:48.500 --> 56:51.460
You can of course download it at most of the usual suspect sites, but something to think

56:51.460 --> 56:55.180
about, you probably want to make sure you have the latest drivers for your video card

56:55.180 --> 57:00.580
before you download that big old game, otherwise you might be sorry.

57:00.580 --> 57:04.360
Maybe I'll get Bioshock for the PC over the 360, who knows, but then again I want achievement

57:04.360 --> 57:05.360
points because of achievement points.

57:05.360 --> 57:08.580
I don't think it's going to run that well on PC, at least not on our PC.

57:08.580 --> 57:10.620
Probably not on my PC, that's true.

57:10.620 --> 57:16.260
One other thing to speak about here, Nintendo Power has apparently given Metroid Prime 3

57:16.260 --> 57:18.140
a 10 out of 10.

57:18.140 --> 57:19.660
Wow, really?

57:19.660 --> 57:23.420
A Nintendo Run magazine giving their game a 10 out of 10?

57:23.420 --> 57:24.420
That's so surprising.

57:24.420 --> 57:30.180
Hold on, because something that the story notes is that you may or may not remember,

57:30.180 --> 57:35.040
but Ocarina of Time only got a 9.5 from Nintendo Power, so the fact they gave this a 10 out

57:35.040 --> 57:37.140
of 10 does make your eyebrow raise a little bit.

57:37.140 --> 57:42.780
Oh wow, okay, so a 9.5, because that's really different than a 10.

57:42.780 --> 57:47.380
It's almost perfect, but Metroid, that's perfect.

57:47.380 --> 57:51.140
Really do you think they would have to sell more of Ocarina of Time?

57:51.140 --> 57:57.900
I think that game sells itself, whereas Metroid Prime maybe needs a little help to be selling

57:57.900 --> 57:59.220
some of those units.

57:59.220 --> 58:01.220
Yeah, I know.

58:01.220 --> 58:05.460
I don't know if it's especially newsworthy because it is a Nintendo magazine, but I will

58:05.460 --> 58:10.220
be very impressed if it starts getting more perfect reviews from other places.

58:10.220 --> 58:13.940
Even the official Xbox magazine sometimes rags on some of the releases.

58:13.940 --> 58:15.100
I want to say I read some review.

58:15.100 --> 58:20.100
I think they gave Track and Field a 3 on the Xbox Live Arcade, which I don't know.

58:20.100 --> 58:25.420
For some people it might have been too high of a score, and a lot of folks are giving

58:25.420 --> 58:27.460
Bioshock, of course, very high scores.

58:27.460 --> 58:32.260
Joshi16 in chat is pointing out that Bioshock got a 10 out of 10 from the original Xbox

58:32.260 --> 58:34.700
magazine, but is that really a shock?

58:34.700 --> 58:35.700
Is it?

58:35.700 --> 58:36.700
Who knows?

58:36.700 --> 58:40.860
Nintendo Maniac 64 says Ocarina of Time's negative 0.5 was from Navi.

58:40.860 --> 58:46.380
Listen, listen, listen, goddammit, listen!

58:46.380 --> 58:50.060
All right, well, that pretty much does it for all the stories tonight.

58:50.060 --> 58:52.900
I don't really think we have anything else.

58:52.900 --> 58:55.260
I opened up the Skype line and told the chat they could call in.

58:55.260 --> 58:59.220
I'll give one more shout if you guys want to get through 1-877, because I guess they're

58:59.220 --> 59:07.020
still live and still going, 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

59:07.020 --> 59:08.980
Call!

59:08.980 --> 59:10.320
We'll see.

59:10.320 --> 59:11.320
If not...

59:11.320 --> 59:12.320
Ah, there we go.

59:12.320 --> 59:14.140
We're getting some calls now.

59:14.140 --> 59:15.140
Just takes a little bit.

59:15.140 --> 59:17.740
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

59:17.740 --> 59:18.740
Legend of Zaku.

59:18.740 --> 59:20.740
Oh, see, because you missed the first wave.

59:20.740 --> 59:22.100
What's on your mind, Zaku?

59:22.100 --> 59:24.220
Nah, I just came back from 8 on the break.

59:24.220 --> 59:25.220
How was that?

59:25.220 --> 59:30.260
Just had a little 2DX tournament today, managed to be some chumps and, you know, distorted.

59:30.260 --> 59:34.220
But yeah, Champions of the Coast wasn't so bad this weekend.

59:34.220 --> 59:37.060
You're always going to some tournament on the East Coast, it seems like.

59:37.060 --> 59:39.660
Actually, it's my first 2DX tournament.

59:39.660 --> 59:42.060
Wow, well, how was the 2DX tournament set up?

59:42.060 --> 59:43.060
Was it fun?

59:43.060 --> 59:44.500
Yeah, it was pretty good.

59:44.500 --> 59:49.020
I mean, there were, you know, we didn't have to qualify since there were not, you know,

59:49.020 --> 59:53.700
not that many people to actually, I mean, there was a lot of people, but not enough

59:53.700 --> 59:59.100
to actually warrant one, so it was just random seating, but yeah, it was just having to go

59:59.100 --> 01:00:04.100
through people and just playing on, you know, from particular sides.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.160
I didn't know you were much of a BeatMania 2DX player.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:13.620
Of course, man, but yeah, I've also, but if there's anything that would make that whole

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:16.060
weekend is just seeing a 2DX freestyle.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.060
A 2DX freestyle?

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.060
Yes.

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.060
How did that work?

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:26.180
The break is the only place we can freestyle any machine, any of their music or dancing

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.180
machines.

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:30.060
Well, who did that and what did they do?

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:36.740
They did Tangerine Streams, some sort of, you know, homoerotic stuff, no offense, but

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:42.140
there were two guys just like, you know, one with the long hair, just petting them while

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:47.220
they were hitting the keys, you know, petting his hair and pressing it up.

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.220
Interesting.

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.220
Yeah, that's what I think.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:53.820
Okay, I'm going to challenge you this week.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:57.220
Tell me something in your gaming week that has nothing to do with music games.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.300
What other kinds of games do you play?

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.300
I don't know.

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:05.580
I'm just thinking about a 360, but since, you know, the failure rate's too high, I don't

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:11.700
know if Bioshock or anything like, you know, Halo 3 Gears of War would just be, would just

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.100
outweigh all the risks in just buying a 360 in the first place.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:19.980
Dude, you're the second caller tonight to tell us that the failure rate issues are making

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.020
you contemplate the 360.

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:23.020
That's making me nervous.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.020
It's interesting.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:30.620
And God forbid a PS3, and I know I don't want to pick the latter, so I don't really have

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:34.340
that much of a choice right now.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:40.860
As a person who personally owns multiple Xbox 360 systems and has never had one crap out

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:45.020
for heat issues, I don't know what the hell people are talking about.

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:52.580
I mean seriously, okay, maybe your system, okay, maybe you may have, you know, the unlikely

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.300
situation where your system craps out.

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.300
Who gives a shit?

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.300
You have a fucking three year warranty on the heat related issues.

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.300
It gets replaced within a couple weeks.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.060
That's the issue.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.860
They're making me wait two, three weeks just to get, just to get a new one.

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:07.860
Boo fucking who?

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:09.860
That's what I have to fucking say about that.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:15.980
I don't, I don't get why Sony can make a PS3 that craps out, you know, at a blue moon,

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:22.700
and 360s is like what, like four in ten consoles, like what, one in four consoles are breaking

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:23.700
out?

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.700
Come on.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.400
How do we know that their console won't crap out?

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:30.140
There hasn't been enough games to play on it that have fucking actually done anything.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:34.140
I mean the reason why the systems crap out for the 360, I think a lot of people are putting

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:38.220
these in their entertainment cabinets and they're just doing stupid shit with them.

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:42.100
And okay, let's say for example that there is something wrong with, you know, the heat

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.780
sink on the chip.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:46.700
All the new consoles now have the upgraded heat sinks on them.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:52.340
If you happen to get an older one by some magical, you know, mistake, they will fix

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:56.500
it within a couple weeks and that will be the end of your problems altogether.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.820
Why waiting two weeks for something is a big deal.

01:02:58.820 --> 01:02:59.820
Okay, okay.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:03.000
But I don't want to be, I don't want to have those horror, I don't want to be, play out

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.780
the horror stories of having to go through eight, ten consoles just to get it right.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:11.580
I mean it's just, it's just, it's retarded to just have to go through multiple consoles.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.140
You're not, hold on, shut up for a minute.

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:16.060
I died, not used that good, but look.

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:20.960
I did have an Xbox 360 that did crap out on me after four days and I was so fucking pissed

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.960
when it happened.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.140
You remember on this program I was blah, blah, blah, don't you fucking buy a 360 because

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.820
they'll fucking die on you, blah, blah, blah.

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.440
I was so pissed when it happened, but I'm over it.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.220
I mean they were quick, they got, they got the job done.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.780
I mean it didn't take two or three weeks.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:35.780
I had it back that week.

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:36.780
Did they pay for shipping?

01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:37.780
Did they pay for everything?

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:44.020
Did they pay for shipping, you know, they sent me a box, they sent me a coffin to send

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.020
it back in.

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:46.420
I heard they don't do that anymore.

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:47.420
I think they still do.

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:50.300
That's the thing, then I have to incur charges when I should be.

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.620
You're not going to incur any charges, then you're talking about like they're going to

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:55.020
have to replace the system eight times.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.540
If that were the case, they wouldn't be selling millions of fucking consoles.

01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:01.380
This wouldn't be like a hot selling item.

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:03.940
You already have that happening to certain people.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:08.140
Here's what the problem is, you hear fucking idiots on the god damn internet that bitch

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:12.700
like fucking little babies about their fucking console breaking, and everyone's like, oh

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:15.460
my god, all of them are breaking all at once.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.460
Don't give me that bullshit.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.460
I have a migraine now.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.460
All right.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.460
Okay.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.460
Hold on.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:25.340
Here's my other thought, though, is that what about that the new Xbox 360s have like the

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:27.340
new chips in them or whatever?

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.180
That's yet to be seen.

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:35.380
I mean, if those are if those break out less, you know, like, you know, once in a blue moon

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:40.780
or they're very, very rare, then I'll hop on it, you know, you know, at the top of the

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:41.780
hat.

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:42.780
I'll tell you what.

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:43.780
I'll tell you what.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.980
Drew Nami in chat says, Loki, you need to fag your anger.

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:46.980
I'll tell you what.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:47.980
Fine.

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:48.980
You can go ahead and skip buying a 360.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:49.980
I'll enjoy playing Bioshock.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.700
You can go ahead and wait for the next big game to come out for the PlayStation.

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.700
Oh, I'm sure I'll be next year sometime.

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:57.980
I would say he could get it on PC, but he has a Mac, right?

01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:02.740
I'm building a new PC anyway, so that's going to be happening a few days once I start ordering

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:03.740
the parts.

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:10.300
I've already set aside a good 15, 1600 for so it's come the PC can hold me for now.

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:14.980
And then hopefully by Christmas, once we know whether the new heat sinks will actually make

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:18.660
a difference, then I'll think about, well, the PC might hold you, but will it give it

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:19.660
the reach around?

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:20.660
Oh, no.

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:23.580
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:30.500
And on that note, look, Zaku, I appreciate the springer-fied call that this show got,

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.020
but we appreciate the perspective.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.020
Yes.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.020
Sorry, Zaku.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.020
Time's up.

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.020
Take care though.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:37.020
All right.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.020
Bye.

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.020
Bye.

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:40.020
I can have new calls?

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.020
Seriously.

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.020
Seriously.

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:43.020
People talking about fucking heat sinks and issues with it.

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.100
This is more than just Zaku though.

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:49.340
This is your pent up anger at all the internet blogs and people across the entire internet

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.580
that have made people like Zaku.

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.180
I don't know what the fuck they want.

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:56.540
I mean, they've already decided, they've already made revisions to fix this problem.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.740
They have a three-year fucking warranty on it.

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:00.080
What the hell more do you want?

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:05.620
I mean, if you're Sony PlayStation 3 craps out on you, good luck in it fixed.

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:06.620
Maybe you could like do my dishes.

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:07.620
I don't know.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.620
It'd be pretty awesome.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.620
I don't know.

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:10.620
It's just, it's stupid.

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:11.620
It really is.

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.620
All right.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:13.620
Another call.

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:14.620
One more call, then this is it.

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:15.620
Hi.

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:16.620
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:17.620
Who's this?

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:18.620
Hello.

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:19.620
It's Paradox Vincent.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:20.620
Hello, Paradox Vincent.

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:21.620
What's on your mind?

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:22.620
Hey.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:23.620
How are you?

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:24.620
I'm good.

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:25.620
How are you?

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:26.620
Not bad.

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:27.620
Not much.

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.620
Just calling in after a while.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:32.740
I haven't been able to really listen to the show live, but finally got sat down and sit

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.980
down and talk to you guys again.

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:35.980
Yeah.

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:36.980
Well, what's up?

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.820
Was there a story tonight you wanted to comment on?

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:47.220
I did play the Kentucky Fried Cruelty Chicken Game, and it was pretty good.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:53.700
It's definitely better than a lot of charity organizations putting up web games on there.

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:55.900
It was fun and stuff.

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:59.660
It was certainly better than most politically oriented games, and even better than a lot

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.740
of Homebrew, which, oh, I can't believe.

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:02.940
I'm so sorry, Paradox Vincent.

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.740
I've got to go on a tangent for a minute.

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:10.980
Did you hear about the Homebrew that was on the DS that was like, avoid the gay mob or

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.340
whatever it is?

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:17.500
You control the little character, and then if you get hit by the mob, it goes, oh, you

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.340
got hit by a gay person.

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.340
Game over.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.340
It's huge.

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:26.060
It's been hitting all these websites because it's like, oh my gosh, homophobia in the Homebrew

01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.260
scene.

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:30.820
I just kind of read it going, well, there's idiots everywhere.

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:35.540
The unfortunate thing is that when you give this guy attention, unfortunately, more people

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.840
are going to seek this game out and play it.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:42.700
Not just people who like gay guys who want to play it and laugh at it for being stupid,

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:45.380
which I admit I was tempted to do, but I didn't.

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:48.500
But then you're also going to have people that inadvertently read about this through

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:54.860
sites like MTV or whatever that report on it going, yeah, I do hate gays.

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.580
I want to play this game, and I want to find this guy who made this game and help him make

01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.820
a better game.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:00.820
I don't know.

01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:04.680
I don't think we should give these kinds of things any attention whatsoever.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.460
So maybe I shouldn't have said anything about it at all, but I just thought the whole thing

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:10.440
was very interesting, and the Homebrew was really bad.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.440
It's really bad.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.940
Anyway, sorry, Paradox.

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:13.940
Really bad, Homebrew.

01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:14.940
Yes, really bad.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.740
So, okay, back to the PETA game.

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:21.740
What do you think was their motivations for making it?

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:29.020
You know, it's either what you said in trying to kind of target the video game playing audience

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:38.740
and tell them, hey, Kentucky Fried Chicken is bad, or they could have just been seeking

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:45.700
out a new media to get their message out, and then they noticed that web games are pretty

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:46.700
popular.

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:52.360
So then they just chose that route, which, I mean, there are certain things that I like

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:58.940
to convey more through music and film that it's not necessarily targeting a specific

01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:07.940
audience but just kind of getting things views out there, so it could have just been that.

01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:19.460
What I'm also curious about, because it kind of got me thinking about it, is that if they

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:24.100
chose to do this to connect with a gaming audience, it kind of worked, didn't it?

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:28.280
Because all the major gaming blogs reported on it, and I probably would have never heard

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:31.960
of this game had it not been posted, like all these different blogs are on the internet.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.580
So in a way, it kind of worked, and it kind of did get their message out there, huh?

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:36.580
Here's the thing.

01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:42.020
It got the attention because it's on all these game blogs.

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.300
You know they're going to get a cease and desist for this.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.140
That's going to be even more attention for them.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.140
Do you think?

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.140
I don't think they will.

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:50.140
I think they will.

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:51.860
All right, we'll see.

01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:52.860
I wouldn't know.

01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.860
All right.

01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:57.780
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Paradox Vincent?

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:01.740
Yes, two things, and I'll try to get them done real quick.

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:04.140
Quick guitar hero, 80s review.

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:05.140
Great song list.

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:11.820
I love almost every song in there, and they gave me a couple new favorite songs, but they're

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:19.660
just really kind of not great charts, especially the turning Japanese chart was really boring,

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:25.740
but I guess it's Activision's first real take at a music game, to my understanding, and

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:30.020
hopefully they'll be getting better by the time Guitar Hero 3 comes out.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:37.620
This is Harmonic's third game, Guitar Hero was, so they already knew what they were doing

01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:38.620
a lot.

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:45.300
Also, I don't know if anybody's heard, but there is a 2DEX gold machine in Arizona right

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:51.820
now as of probably about a month and a half ago, and it's at Mesa Golf Land, Sun Splash,

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:57.340
and the one-player turntable right now, though, is broke or stolen or something as I know

01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:58.340
it.

01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:03.140
That I would have never have guessed, because Mesa Golf Land is just like Roseville Golf

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.140
Land.

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:10.180
It's huge and it has the water park, if I remember right, and everything.

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:16.220
And they might be getting a popin' music machine, but they just said mics.

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:19.020
I'm hoping they will, though, so that's really all.

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.460
All right, well, thanks so much for the call.

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:22.460
Appreciate it, Paradox Vincent.

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:23.460
You have a great week, okay?

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:24.460
All right, you guys too.

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:25.460
All right, later.

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:26.460
See ya.

01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:29.860
Have lots of fun playing the 2DEX gold machine, that's for sure.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:32.820
You know what's funny, though, is I think the PD game worked in reverse for me, because

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:38.060
I forgot about, you know, KFC, you know, they kind of fell off my radar as far as food options.

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.540
I'm like, you know, hey, KFC sounds kind of good right now.

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.780
I was sort of thinking about getting fried chicken on the way home.

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:43.780
You guys.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.780
I'm a southern girl.

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:48.300
I grew up on fried chicken and grits.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:51.700
Here's one thing I do love about KFC, is that most of them-

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:52.700
Biscuits.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:53.700
No, no, no, no.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:54.700
Most of them have A&Ws attached to them.

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:55.700
Biscuits.

01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:58.660
A&W root beer is the bomb when it comes out of the tap.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:11:59.660
Biscuits.

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:00.660
There was one time- Biscuits and honey.

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:01.660
All right, biscuits.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:02.660
We get it.

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.940
There was one time I passed it up and I really wanted to do it.

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:07.900
They were selling root beer in gallon jugs, like the mojo.

01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:08.900
They were.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:09.900
I was like, whoa.

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.900
I remember that.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:11.900
That's good shit.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:12.900
They were big things.

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:14.260
They were root beer right out of the tap.

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.260
Wow.

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:17.660
And Julie and I got three of them and drank them in a night.

01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:18.660
It was fantastic.

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.220
It was diet reaper.

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.540
Quick comments from the recent phone call there.

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:23.540
We're still live.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.540
It's been 25 minutes since the maintenance was supposed to start.

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:26.540
We're still live.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.540
Hey, hey.

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:28.540
God damn life.

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:29.540
You thought I'm screwing us all up.

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:30.540
Oh, well.

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.140
Have you had any sort of retraction notices or anything?

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:33.140
I don't know.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.140
I'm not even going to bother with it.

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.140
No, they were smart.

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:38.300
They would just say that they're taking the service offline for a while to protest the

01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:43.980
whole law going in place, even though they were doing maintenance.

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:45.980
Don't even get me started.

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:47.620
You know, I don't see anything about it.

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:48.620
Let me see.

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:50.140
I'm going to check this over.

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:52.780
Meanwhile, raw steel UT says, Rob, it didn't work.

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:54.140
We're still going to eat KFC.

01:12:54.140 --> 01:13:00.420
I don't know, but if a couple people changed their mind, maybe some people would tell you

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:01.420
it was worth it.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:05.260
And I showed it to another friend of mine, and another friend of mine played it and said,

01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:08.020
oh, wow, you know, I don't want KFC anymore.

01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:11.420
The only thing I'm pissed off about KFC is they got rid of their chicken livers.

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:15.780
I used to love those things, and they used to have, I think, some sweet and sour sauce,

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.580
and I think they got rid of that stuff too.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:20.620
I love their sweet and sour sauce.

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:24.500
Josie 16 says, I'm going to order fried chicken right now to protest.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.300
I used to get their chicken livers all the time.

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.300
They came in a big bucket.

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.300
You get gravy with it.

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.460
Oh, my God, that was so good.

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:33.460
You need to have the chicken livers at Roscoe's, though.

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:34.700
All right.

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:36.020
That's going to do it for tonight's show.

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:38.620
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:40.620
Loki, we'll start off with you tonight.

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.740
Your final thought.

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:46.580
I get some Bioshock next week, and that makes me happy.

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:51.540
My final thought is ow, tooth, hurt, hate, dentist, cry.

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.140
Darsarha, your final thought.

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:55.180
I think I want some chicken liver right now.

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.180
All right.

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.900
Thank you, guys, for tuning in and listening to us tonight.

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:02.780
Thank you to all the live listeners, and sorry the maintenance didn't happen to what was

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:04.340
supposed to happen.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.340
Very interesting.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:12.580
No, I'm surprised that PETA hasn't shut down our peep jousting tournaments that we do once

01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:16.500
in a while because, you know, marshmallow chickens, they're still chickens.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:17.500
All right.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.780
Well, that's it, guys.

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:22.220
Thank you so much, especially to you podcast folks, also thank you for downloading us and

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:26.500
supporting our show, and thank you for all the positive reviews that some of you left

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:27.500
on iTunes.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.340
We always really appreciate stuff like that.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.740
And thank you for supporting the show, you know, and if you love Orange Lounge Radio,

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:32.740
we do it for free.

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.340
We don't put ads in the show.

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:38.580
Tell two people you know about Orange Lounge Radio, and that's how we spread the word.

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:39.580
Take a step up.

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:40.580
Three people.

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.380
Independent radio needs your support in order to survive because we don't have any major

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.540
magazines we can run ads in or anything like that.

01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:47.540
So that's it.

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:49.660
I'll get off my high horse now and sign off.

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:51.020
Goodbye, Loki.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.020
Goodbye, Dark Sakura.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.020
Goodbye, me.

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:54.020
