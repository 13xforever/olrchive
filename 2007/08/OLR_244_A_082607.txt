New Castlevania games are being made for an unlikely platform, Sony confirms a video recorder for the PlayStation 3, and a much anticipated 360 game gets pushed back to December.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that video game podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts.
Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
My head is numb.
Who doesn't have a microphone on tonight.
I do now.
There you go.
How are you doing?
Hey, I have a head injury, so leave me alone.
I'm sorry to hear.
What happened to your head?
I was getting out of the car and then I was getting back into the car and my foot slipped out from under me.
I see.
On the gravel outside and I hit my head on the top of my Lancer.
Aw, sorry to hear it.
Metal hurts when it hits you in the head.
Yes.
It was like one moment I'm upright, the next moment I actually have my head laying on the seat of the driver's side of my car.
Do you think that the great people up in the sky were trying to tell you something?
I have a concussion, Rob.
Sorry to hear it.
Well, this should make for a riveting tonight's show, so we'll see.
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
Hello.
Hi, Loki.
How are you doing?
Doing good.
Excellent.
All right.
Well, let's get into how we like to start the show off always with a little bit of how is your gaming week.
If you want to join along and participate in the program, though, head on over to our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, and you can participate in tonight's program.
Meanwhile, let's start it off.
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
I played a bunch of Final Fantasy VI in the car and then didn't save it.
That's not good.
On a Game Boy Micro.
I was extra motion sick for the entire time.
It was fantastic.
And then I got like 2 billion on World Cup Soccer the other day.
I was pretty happy.
Pinball?
Yes, pinball.
Pinball fun?
Well, I either just take up space.
I have no choice but to play them.
What's more fun, pinball or Final Fantasy?
Pinball.
I just curious.
Final Fantasy pinball, if that existed.
Dude, that would be beautiful.
They should make a Final Fantasy pinball.
But pinball is instant gratification because it goes banging.
It makes noises.
It's banging.
Dan took the glass off of our Twilight Zone, so I put the camera in and took pictures from inside the machine.
You know what else would be cool with pinball machines?
A laser light show, if they could do that, too.
Tonight's show is very broken.
I'll explain why in a minute.
I'm trying to multitask in a lot of different ways.
Anything else you want to share with your gaming week, DarkSakura?
I don't like concussions.
They should make concussion the game.
How exactly does that work?
You just go around hitting people in the head.
And the worse of a head injury you give them without killing them, the better you score.
Alright, well, let's...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
What happened was... You just want to see what happens when you kill little girls.
What happened was that I was unable to get an achievement, so I need to restart the game, so now I'm doing that again.
I love how you'll go back and play the whole game over just because you missed an achievement.
Oh, hell yeah.
Well, I'm trying to... I don't want to have to play the whole game over again, and I wasn't that far to begin with, so now I'm just going back and doing what I did.
And then, of course, I played...
The Silent Hill Origins demo that magically got leaked out there.
So I played that on the PSP, and I gotta say, man, between what we saw originally at the Konami BBQ to what it is now, completely different game.
I mean, this game looks friggin' awesome.
It's just, I don't know, it looks actually better than some of the PlayStation 2 versions.
So, definitely one to pick up on the PSP.
And let's see, other than that, I actually played a little bit of Saints Row.
We finally got our entire game room up at work.
And we did a five-player Saints Row deathmatch on that.
And it looks sweet, the setup we have.
And hopefully I'll have some pictures soon.
What exactly does your game room at work consist of?
The game room at work consists of five Xbox 360s.
and there's LCD monitors for each one of those and then four of those are tied in to a 37 inch LCD TV that we have mounted to the wall so if you really wanted to you can actually tune in on the TV four different monitors and see what other people are you know their perspective so if someone's watching us play they don't have to look over our shoulders they can actually dial it in and see what other people are doing.
or you can just play it on the TV if you're only doing one person on there or something so other cool things we talked about doing with that is actually like Project Gotham Racing where you could do four people actually racing each other and then the fifth one would be on the big screen and that would be kind of one of the spectator mode options there so that way everyone's racing and you see kind of a racetrack view of the whole game so that would be pretty slick
But it's basically for the event that we've got coming this coming week with our publishers coming out and stuff.
And also, really it's for Grand Theft Auto 4 because we're that obsessed with Grand Theft Auto.
Too bad you got all that set up and now you're going to have to wait until next year though.
That's okay.
We've got Saints Row in the meantime, and we're going to beg the publishers to give us copies, multiple copies of upcoming games that would possibly be something we'd want to play.
All right, well, let me get some comments here from our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
I'm looking at Ross Steel UT says, Not killing any of the Little Sisters is how you get the best ending, too.
And then Undead Zerglings asks, Achievement Whore?
Yes, Loki is an achievement whore.
He will buy games just to get the achievement points out of them.
Not necessarily.
I don't really do that anymore.
I used to, though.
I will play games that are crappy for achievement sometimes.
Out of the last few Xbox Live Arcade releases, how many would you say you bought strictly to get the achievement points out of them?
None of the recent ones, because I've got a little bit smarter on that.
But let's see.
Previous ones that I bought for achievement, Pac-Man, Frogger.
Um, shit, what else did I buy?
Um, I don't know, there's quite a few games that I bought on kind of like an impulse buy.
Luckily now I've gotten it where I don't buy games, you know, straight outright, I will play the demo first.
Except for Catan.
Catan I had to download the full thing, but I knew what that was, you know, before I played it, so.
But, uh, yeah, now I strictly, I play the demos first, and...
Then if I like it, I'll buy it.
SSJ100 Matt in our chat says, so Loki is more of a high-priced whore now.
Exactly.
My gaming week, I didn't play a whole lot of new stuff.
I, unlike most of America, did not run out and buy Bioshock right away because I'm kind of holding out to see if some used copies or a price cut shows up.
Plus, I'm going to be in L.A.
most of next week.
I would say, well, locally, you can buy it at Fry's for $49.99.
Really?
See, that's what I'm holding out for, some deals like that.
I heard Circuit City was doing some type of sale, too.
That's the other thing, too, I was going to say.
I bought the limited edition, and I'm sure everyone read on the Internet that they've had some problems with the...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, I don't know what it is.
Let me check my email.
Finally, they got it for me.
But, you know, to be honest, I opened the thing up, took some superglue to it.
You can't even tell it broke.
So, I don't care.
I don't want the fucking art book.
You can download it for free.
I don't need that thing.
But the other thing about the limited edition, if you are, you know, I don't know if you can still buy them now, but if you were thinking about buying one, let me put it this way.
The remix CD that they have on there with three tracks, they're remixed by Moby.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
But the game's awesome, though, so it doesn't matter.
I just wanted the figurine for my desk.
Didn't give a shit about the extra CD.
Alright, well, let's see.
What did I do for My Gaming Week?
My Gaming Week...
Oh gosh, I didn't do a whole lot of new stuff.
I did play some of the new offerings on Xbox Live Arcade, like Space Giraffe.
Space Giraffe is interesting because it tries to assert itself that it's not Tempest, although it kind of is Tempest to me.
But here's the thing, and I love Tempest.
Tempest 2000 is one of my favorite games of all times.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's gonna benefit you in some way and then just unfortunately the AI just really pisses you off and you're just like, fuck it, I'm gonna kill you all now.
And then you realize, hey, helping them out actually didn't do anything for me so I'm just gonna kill them all.
All right.
That's pretty much it for my game of the week.
I don't have a lot else to share.
So what else do we get into now?
I guess we can move on to some housekeeping.
So housekeeping.
First off, we are going to be incorporating video into the show real soon, and that's why you've heard me kind of messing around a little bit during the pre-show there, and I am somewhat distracted because on the laptop I'm playing with this site we're going to be using to stream our video, Operator11.com.
which if you guys are familiar with All Games, All Games Interactive, it's the website they use and they've been encouraging some of the other shows and networks to start using it.
Although I do want to make clear, we're not turning into a TV show and we're not going to be using video too heavily.
We just want you guys to be able to see us as we broadcast the show if you want.
I don't know why people would want to see that.
We're not going to be using the... You can call us with your webcam and all that stuff?
Play porn?
That, um, hey, playing porn on the webcam, that was something that we did back at the old apartment.
So, a couple studios ago, when we used to play Gal's Panic over the webcam.
Yeah, no, we're not going to be turning into a TV show suddenly.
It's just like a little something extra.
And the funny thing is, I was streaming the first part of the show, but this is how fickle it is and how broken it is.
I was actually streaming the first few moments of the show, and then I accidentally clicked the wrong link, and now it's gone.
Like, I accidentally, like, refreshed the page and screwed everything up.
So I'm going to have to start over again later or something.
I don't know.
So I'm still trying to get used to this program.
So maybe we'll stream Part B. I don't know.
But it's off now.
It was going.
But in the channel, there's some video of me playing Super Metroid earlier, but the audio is all screwed up.
I really don't encourage you to visit it.
It's not worth your time.
We're trying, though.
We've heard a lot of folks, especially the folks that listen to us live on Sunday night, want to see video, so we're trying to add that into the show, but we're not going to go TV all of a sudden.
Why would you want to see video?
I don't know.
We don't do anything.
We don't really do anything.
I don't know what they think this is.
Are they under the impression that there's an actual lounge in here, that we're all kicking back with martinis or something, you know, just shooting the shit?
I mean, we're just sitting in a small room.
I think it has potential maybe later on if we want to shoot video at whatever tournaments we end up at or shows we end up at.
We can put that in the show and interviews we do as well.
And then the video users can see video, but the audio users don't have anything taken away from them.
You know what I mean?
So I just want to see how we can enhance with video.
But that's a long time coming.
We'll see.
If you have ideas, email us, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
And I, of course, will be talking to some of the folks that already use Op11 and see what they think.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Anyways, no, gaming news.
So this week, a little interesting.
We're going to start things off, of course, talking about a very interesting development out of Leipzig.
And that would be the new Track and Field game on the DS.
It's, I guess, the 25th anniversary of Track and Field.
And as you remember last week, I could care less about the Xbox Live Arcade game.
But now there's the new international Track and Field game, which is going to feature...
20 different athletic events.
And I guess there was going to be some unlockable Konami characters to play, including they've got Sparkster from Rocket Knight Adventures and Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2.
Which, to be honest, I think Pyramid Head would win because he'd just butcher everybody else.
But, you know, I wonder if raping people is one of the events in there because... He only rapes monsters.
Pyramid Head being in the game is all kinds of awesome, though, you have to admit.
That's pretty rad.
Anyway, later in the program during Part B, we'll be talking about characters we would like to see in this track and field game in a segment we call Listless.
We'll get into that a little later in the program.
They didn't say anything else about the events or any additional, like, how the game will play?
Is it going to be button mashing again?
That's what I want to know.
Well, I'm assuming since it's on the DS, it's probably going to have something to do with the stylists.
But they didn't really say anything other than there will be four player matches via, they said locally or via Wi-Fi.
I'm assuming, you know, Wi-Fi ad hoc and Wi-Fi info structure.
Downloadable content and online rankings, leaderboards and detailed player profiles.
So that's kind of cool that they're going to do leaderboards and that kind of thing.
And I guess a ticker to include like a news feed.
It says promise to update anyone playing online whenever a world record is broken.
Oh, great.
So playing the new track and field is going to be like watching CNN.
You're going to have to try and watch what's going on in this box.
And you've got the ticker down here.
And then you've got the stock report over here.
Or, I'm sorry, the people that are online over here.
How do they cram all that on a DS screen?
It looks cool.
I'm surprised they didn't do like a Wii version to go along with that, you know.
All right.
Looking at chat here and what's going on there.
Your nickname says, Memo to Konami, use the fucking DDR pad for track and field.
Undead Zergling says, I think Pyramid Head only rapes dolls.
No, he rapes the nurses too.
Escapist says, just what the world needed, more track and field.
NintendoManiac64 said, Pyramid Head's in track and field?
Dude!
And then going back to the webcam chat we had just before the show started there.
Let's see, we had...
Jaded says, I think it would be funny seeing Loki kick everyone's ass during one of his fits about Max.
Kropotkin says, I mean, seeing people's faces stresses what people are thinking and saying.
Dark Knight says, remember Rob did TV before.
That was like 10 years ago.
I wouldn't even count that.
I'm an old man now.
My young, fresh television face is long gone.
All right, let's...
And now it's kind of moldy.
Cover art for the track and field game.
So you can actually check out their DeviantArt page for some of the work they did on it.
And some of those Chibi characters were really cute.
Like Chibi Pyramid Head is still a winner.
I do have to agree with Shane, though.
They used the movie Pea Hittie.
They didn't use the Pea Hittie that you love and adore?
No, not the one with the unwieldy gigantic head.
Sorry to hear it.
Final Fantasy IV Final Fantasy III
DSFanboy.com Have you heard anything about a release in the U.S.
for this, Loki?
No, the next two games come out here.
There's Final Fantasy Tactics The Lion War, Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings, Front Mission DS, and Dragon Quest Monsters Joker.
This will probably be, if anything, in the spring maybe.
We'll see.
Well, that's all I have to say on Final Fantasy IV, but it is one of my favorite Final Fantasy games, so I'm very excited to see what they pull off.
Wake me up when they bring out VI.
Rob, are you spoony?
It's a possibility.
You're a spoony bard.
I'll have you know.
No.
Well, for anyone who's into mobile gaming, there is an offering for the mobile phone.
It's Castlevania Order of Shadows that they're saying is a collaboration with Igarashi.
Tyrone Rodriguez
It's supposed to be released on September 18th, so if you really care, then have fun.
I was looking at some of the pictures of it, and, well, I don't know.
It's a cell phone game.
How great can it be?
I'll tell you what, though.
It has the skull thingies.
There's some pretty powerful stuff on cell phones right now.
Will they be jeweled?
Well, not like that, but not necessarily game-wise, but application-wise.
You know how you can download Gmail and actually run that as an application on your phone?
Your phone has to be kind of made in the past couple years, and it runs Java-based things.
But now they have an Opera Mini browser, and I swear it is so much more powerful and better than the Sprint built-in browser that I have on my phone otherwise.
It's awesome.
Well, this doesn't look too bad.
Yahoo has its own thing now, too.
I'm sure cell phone games are getting better and better, but it's still not my gaming platform of choice, that's for sure.
I know what the graphics remind me of.
What's that?
It reminds me of Rondo of Blood on the TurboGrafx.
That's what it looks like.
Interesting.
All right, well, let's move on to some more stories.
Yes, and speaking of other phone-based games...
and more homebrew stuff of course MAME has been ported over to the iPhone or at least is beginning to be ported over there right now it doesn't really run a lot but some games like Pac-Man and Q-Bert run pretty well and of course some other ones you have to have with frames skipping and lower sound quality but I don't know, looks interesting yet a start of better things to come I'm sure
The iPhone is going to be an interesting platform to program games on because I would think that looks a little bit beefier of a phone at least a pretty large screen on them compared to say a normal phone and then of course with the touch screen and stuff.
Be interesting.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The thing about Apple is that you know next year they're going to come out with a different model that is a little bit better.
Next year?
Let's try Christmas.
We'll see.
I don't know.
RossDLUT says, The iPhone sucks for gaming.
It has no real buttons.
Jaded says, Myspace will redeem the iPhone, LOL.
I think that means sarcasm there.
Again, if you want to join our chat, chat.orangeonsradio.com.
Of course, lots of development going on for cell phone games and also another system that kind of makes people raise their eyebrows when new games are announced for it.
Dreamcast, Wind & Water Puzzle Battles, Puzzle Action Game
All you hardcore Dreamcast fans can check out those games.
I'm still missing... I have a box with my Dreamcast packed in it.
Or two boxes.
I've only found one, and that one has just the AV cords and controllers.
I'm like, where's my Dreamcast?
You know, I think I might have it because I've only got two Dreamcasts around here.
Oh, maybe that's where it is.
Okay.
Maybe when your Dreamcast got put in a box of mine somehow when we lived together like three years ago.
I need it back just so I can play Dreamcast games.
Sure thing.
I don't really use it anymore.
Would you buy new games for a Dreamcast, DarkSakura?
Yes.
Just because?
Yes.
I mean, okay, don't get me wrong.
I want my Dreamcast.
I don't know if I'd buy new games for the Dreamcast, but if I remember correctly, I think the copy protection of Dreamcast games was pretty crappy, so.
Alright, well, I don't think I'll be buying these, but it'll be interesting to see what happens with it.
That's for sure.
Well, back to more...
I think this is really cool.
They're basically saying that in the U.S.
that the sales of games and consoles has gone up by 37% since the time of 2006.
Total sales coming up to $925 million, which I think is actually pretty cool.
But it's not a billion.
So, you know what?
Wake me up when it's a billion.
The total sales are at $7 billion.
All right.
Yeah.
But basically, hardware itself is actually raised by 77.4%.
$380.8 million sold.
And actually, most of it is the Wii.
Wait, and this was over the same period last year is what it is?
Yeah.
Okay, that makes sense.
Because, you know, you have new systems out there.
I mean, the Wii and the PlayStation 3, for whatever it's worth, that just weren't out there at this time last year.
So...
And the PS2 and PSP were outselling the Xbox 360, of course.
Biggest games of the month were NCAA Football 08 on 360, Guitar Hero Encore, Roxy 80s PS2, Wii Play, NCAA Football 08 on PS2, and Mario Party 8 on Wii.
That's amazing that Wii Play still continues to sell so many copies.
But I guess it's just people wanting a free Wiimote, sort of.
Also, I should point out that sales in Japan have also increased quite a bit.
The DS itself went, actually just within a week, sold 153,834 units.
That's pretty cool.
This is the last week, fiscal week, I should say.
For the Wii, it actually made it up to 73,938, thanks to...
Some of the really cool games that are out.
PSP, no real game success.
They've sold 33,715 units.
PS3, 21,231 units.
Numbers, numbers, numbers.
What does it all mean, though?
One of the biggest sellers were Everybody's Golf 5.
Huh.
Which is a game that's not even out here yet, right?
No.
Interesting.
Other, though, games that were giving the PS2 a boost were...
J-League winning 11, 2007.
But the poor Xbox 360, poor baby, only 2,445.
Poor, poor baby.
Wait, 2,000?
Yeah.
Xbox 360s or regular Xboxes?
They don't like Xbox 360.
No, that can't be right.
There's got to be more than that.
Blue Dragon sold more copies than that.
My apologies.
Maybe it's regular Xboxes.
It says Xbox 360.
Or in the last month.
I call shenanigans.
I'm hoping a typo then.
Yeah, it's got to be regular Xboxes or something.
It says Xbox 360.
I think it's crap.
But it says it's based on region.
Anyways, if you want to contribute to those wonderful sales numbers, there's going to be some good stuff coming out this week, especially in the US.
Starting off, if you're a fan of golf, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 will be coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, 360, Wii, and PSP.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Let's see here.
You happen to be looking forward to Dynasty Warriors.
Dynasty Warriors Gundam on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 will be coming out this week.
Other games to note, MotoGP 2007 on the 360, Warhawk on the PlayStation 3, as well as Lair.
Lair is going to be coming out on the 30th, so they kind of bumped it up a week.
and let's see on PC Left Behind Eternal Forces the game has been getting some controversy there as well as the Guild Wars expansion is going to be making its way out Eyes of the North and let's see here also on the Wii we've got Metroid Prime 3 Corruption as well as Brunswick Pro Bowling which is supposed to be also coming out on PlayStation 2
and PSP, I believe.
Okay.
Are any of those games something you guys are picking up?
I definitely will probably pick up Blue Dragon, even though the demo was kind of eh.
and I'll probably pick up Metroid Prime as well.
I'm going to be gone most of the week.
I'm holding off on Blue Dragon because I think I might get a copy anyways.
Some other stuff.
Oh, this one is also interesting.
I forgot to mention it.
On PSP, they've got three games that are pretty cool.
Deadhead Fred, which looked pretty cool.
And then Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes and Monster Hunter Freedom 2 looked actually pretty good.
Are you going to get any of those games, DarkSakura?
and DarkSakura.com.
Jintama, Jinsan, Toishu, Boku no Kabuki, Machiniki
It's an action game, but I don't know.
The screenshots of this game look like it has an awful lot of cinematics for being a little bit of an action game.
Another game coming out on the PlayStation 2 for Marvelous Entertainment, Katai Kyoshi Hitman Reborn Dream Hyper Battle.
Another action game coming out there on the PlayStation 2.
Coming out also on the PlayStation 2, Yoki Haim Den, in limited edition and regular formats, an adventure game.
Coming to you from Idea Factory.
And my favorite title of the week, love it, love it, love it, Nintendo DS will see the release of Love Cat Life.
Will be coming out on the Nintendo DS, and here's the best part.
If you look at the box art, it is a complete and utter ripoff of Nintendogs.
because you have the cute little kitties there on the box art and then it says Love Cat Life written in that same format.
What?
Rob.
What?
Rob.
What?
Rob.
You want?
Rob, give me baby kitties.
I can have Love Cat Life?
I want Love Cat Life.
Love Cat Life needs to come out over here so I can play with the kitties.
Look, the cats sing.
There's a singing competition for the cats.
They sing.
Yes.
And look at the thing.
You play the...
I think you play with them.
This game looks like a complete ripoff of Nintendogs in every way except for this cat.
The doggies don't sing.
That's a good thing.
Then there's, look, there's a cat rolling around in a toy truck, a little toy dump truck.
Let me see, let me see.
That's so cute.
And let's see here.
A cat looking angry at the food that's been placed in front of them.
Oh, sorry.
I will post, since I know this makes for great radio, at least for the live folks, I will copy and paste that into chat so you can take a look at the game.
He sure makes that face all the time.
And now you know why.
I don't like this food.
Wake me up when they have Lolcats the game.
They should totally make Lolcats the game.
Dude, there are so many fucking Animal Sim games coming out this fall.
It's not even funny.
I'm looking at the chat room.
Dive says they should make Ninten Ferrets.
Kropotkin says no ferret games to be found.
Didn't that come up a couple weeks ago on the show?
Wild Pet with a Z Wild Pet with a Z
Dolphins.
Yes, you can have pet dolphins.
Imagine babies.
That's a pet baby sim.
I kid you not.
Wow.
Imagine.
with a Z, by the way, because it's edgy.
There's Puppy Love coming out for the Wii.
I remember that one.
Was it Pets, Dogs, and Cats, and Hamster Life 2 or whatever?
All the sequels to those games from last year.
Okay, one of our frequent guests of Orange Entree is back tonight.
Minklatov's here, fresh from Taco Bell with food.
Thanks for smelling up the crappy food in the room.
What did you want to say about Imagine Babies?
I wonder if it uses that slide sensor that the Nintendo games in Japan use, and you could slide babies around.
It's almost like shaking them.
It'd be so awesome.
Imagine not having babies if you actually buy this game.
I imagine it all the time.
The Imagine Baby series, or the Imagine series, I guess, is games meant for girls.
So they have, I kid you not, they have the babies, they have fashion designer, they have chef...
because, you know, women need to cook.
And then they also had, what was the other one that they had that was hilarious?
Oh, Pet Doctor.
I'm thinking my head hurt even more.
Well, because, I understand now, because women should cook, take care of the animals, and have babies.
That sounds like a perfect lineup to me.
See, now it's a bummer the webcam isn't working right now because DarkSakura is giving me the finger.
Thank you.
Appreciate it.
Yes, the webcam broke.
I hit it with a mallet.
I screwed up.
That's the secret.
I hid it with my evil power.
All right.
So how about the UK, Rob?
How about the UK?
It's awesome.
Like a hot dog.
Coming out on the 28th.
What if I don't like hot dogs?
Then 2FU.
The only type of hot dogs I like are the Costco hot dogs.
What do they got?
The Hebrew International ones?
Those are really good.
Those are the bomb.
Anyway, sorry.
We used to work over there.
You know what?
Let's leave Orange Lounge Radio and create the Hot Dog Podcast.
That would be awesome.
No.
Because they are made of lips and thighs.
Ew.
Anyway.
On the 28th, we have Warhawk on PS3.
Yay.
On the 31st, we have Blazing Angel's secret mission, Boogie.
Dragon Ball Z, Goku, Densetsu, Guild Wars, Eye of the North, Stuntman, Ignition on PS2 and Xbox 360, Tales of the World, Radiant Mythology on PSP, Tamagotchi Party On.
Why are there still Tamagotchi games?
Tamagotchi Party Off, please.
Jeez.
Tamagotchi Party's over.
Go home.
Although, you know what I found when I was cleaning, Rob?
What?
I found my old Digimon.
Did you really?
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
who can't be more than like 19 holding a young baby who looks to be about 4 years old that's a big fucking baby that's more like an 8 month old baby that's a big baby the baby's as big as she is and the baby doesn't even like imagine that popping out of your you know where's that's gonna hurt and guess what Shane you'll be happy to know that you can rock the baby so therefore you can shake the baby
Loki, you need to get us a copy of this game for show research.
I will do that.
Rob wants to raise babies.
That's right.
See, now that we have the Operator 11 stuff, we can have these video shows of us playing Imagine Babies.
It'll be fun.
Super Metroid for the win.
I did Super Metroid as a test show tonight.
That's the one thing that's on stream right now.
It's hot.
Well then, can I finish reading the games?
Oh, sorry.
You distracted me with crap.
Sorry, my bad.
Only one more game on the 31st.
We have Worms Open Warfare 2 on PSP and DS.
Another franchise that, while entertaining, while it was new, needs to have that nail in the coffin.
Or at least a chainsaw through the coffin.
That's it.
All done?
Africa.
You sure?
You done?
You sure you're finished?
My head hurts.
Leave me alone.
Imagine Africa.
Not sucking.
Alright.
Ow.
Anyways.
So, yeah, if you don't want to buy something and you want to kind of play a demo of it, there's a brand new demo for Folklore that's finally made its way out from Japan to both Europe and the U.S.
I've talked about this before.
It's an awesome demo.
You should check it out.
You actually pull the souls of creatures out of their bodies and fight with them.
I didn't like that game, but I didn't understand what the hell was going on when you were playing it.
Now that it's in English, it should be a little bit easier to understand.
And of course, the full game is coming out early October.
Check it out.
It's finally nice to see that there's something to download to the PlayStation 3.
Hooray.
Hooray.
Well, I know one game a lot of you folks on the PlayStation 3 are looking forward to is the game Lair.
And the president of Factor 5, who is creating this game Lair, Julian Egbrecht, gave a very interesting speech at the recent Leipzig conference going on in Germany.
This developer called the ESRB standards and practices a bizarre system and also called Lair's certification process a charade.
And he said that in order to be approved for a teen rating, they had to cut out a lot of the blood originally that was in the game, but burning bodies, screaming burning bodies, that was okay.
Eggbrecht went on to kind of say, hey, the MPAA's equivalent rating for movies, PG-13, permits this much bigger spectrum of violence.
Apparently the ESRB has a taboo against sex in games, especially if you're talking about homosexuals, and is basically trying to get developers to band together against the ESRB.
Quote, push the violence, push the sex, but push it in an artistic way.
Show that games are art.
Interesting little cheer call from the Lair developer.
Maybe he's trying to get people to buy Lair to support his cause.
I don't know.
But Lair looks kind of fun, actually.
More games need more butt sex.
You want more butt sex in games?
Surprise butt sex in games.
I don't know about that.
All right.
So that's all I've got to say on Lair.
Well, I have things to say on other stuff.
Imagine that.
I always have things to say.
Imagine Jamie not having anything to say.
Hey, Rob, you know what?
Shut up.
I'll have you know real quick, there's a ton of funny imagine fake box arts that people have done.
Like imagine a whore in a bed.
What?
Imagine, oh my fucking god, kittens in domestic violence.
Imagine if you don't eat, everyone will love you.
Is imagine whore in a bed the prequel to imagine babies?
I don't know.
No, because the whore just has a bunch of them and she donates them to science.
Whore?
Wait, that didn't pick up my mic.
Imagine abortions.
You could totally use the stylus in creative ways.
How about imagine abstinence?
Imagine the next story right now.
Hey, Rob.
What?
Anyway, so the PSP's on-demand video service is out in Europe in 2008.
Isn't that amazing?
It's called Go.
So you just go.
Hey, Jamie.
Go.
Go.
No.
Imagine going.
Is that going to be like our new in-joke that we're just going to beat into the ground?
It's already been done.
I hate to tell you.
It's over.
Walk away.
So what's the big deal about this?
It's a video download service.
It will have a rich selection of high-quality entertainment, so it says.
Can I watch Lost on it?
It's basically in conjunction with Sky's on-demand video.
So no, you won't be able to watch Lost on it because you're not in the UK.
Yeah, Rob.
You can pretend.
Well, can I travel to the UK and download Lost and then come back over here and watch it?
Only if you live in the UK and can pay for it in the UK and all that.
GS68 in our chat room sums it up really well.
He says, stop imagining.
There you have it.
GS68 also wants to know, can I watch porn on it?
Will there be porn on the on-demand service?
It just says entertainment.
Adult Entertainment.
So maybe it's like the Fapparama channel.
I don't know.
How old are we tonight?
13?
12?
That porn on-demand service that you're looking for is called the web browser.
Oh, okay.
Thank you.
It's supposed to be like sports movies.
Rated E for everyone.
Tunes, that type of stuff.
All right.
Well, hooray for the on-demand video service, I suppose.
It would probably be like Skin and Axe level.
Not very interesting porn.
Well, guess what?
There is something else to kind of go along with the other Go thing.
Go Messenger, because I have to say it that way because there is an exclamation point in the middle of the word there, is a PSP, I mean voice and video chat service that will be available also in Europe.
And apparently...
Go!
Messenger!
Go!
Messenger!
Is that what you're saying, Loki?
Yes.
Alright.
Roboboy430 in chat wins with this comment.
Agents are go!
Get it?
Get it?
It wasn't a PSP joke, I'll give you that.
Rob, I need Vicodin to finish this show.
I might have some.
It's going to also use the PSP's remote play features so you can watch live TV and record TV programs remotely on your PSP over a Wi-Fi connection.
It's going to be first available in the UK, France, Italy, Germany, and Spain with more PAL territories to follow.
Finally, a reason to have such a big hard drive on the PlayStation 3, yes?
Well, in Europe.
I'm still waiting for an excuse over here.
Don't you think that it's inevitable this will come out here, though?
Or do you think they're, like, testing it in Europe?
They're not going to because there's no standardized digital service over here.
Duh.
So until that happens, we'll still be waiting.
Well, couldn't they team up with one service?
Kind of like, didn't Xbox 360 team up with that new AT&T service?
I don't know.
But I would think if they're going to do a digital service, do, like, a satellite service.
DarkSakura's Mailbag Segment
Yep.
Hooray!
So we have a nice mailbag segment for you guys tonight.
Of course, you can always interact with us by sending mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com your emails, and DarkSakura will open up the mailbag and read some of her favorites.
So let's go to it.
Reach in the mailbag and pull something out.
What's there this week, DarkSakura?
Some stuff.
The first of the emails.
Dun, dun, dun.
Hey guys, I really like your idea about picking a game and playing it on air.
Dear OLR, listening to your ideas for games coming from old movies, I feel compelled to suggest that several of these studios get together and
and make a Smash Bros.
or Capcom vs. SNK-styled fighting game which brings the protagonists from these old classics together to beat the ever-loving crap out of each other.
Specifically, I wish to see Ewoks fighting the alien cat from The Cat from Outer Space.
Perhaps also Skeletor.
That is all.
Warrior Bob.
Warrior Bob is great.
He's so much fun to hang out with.
I was going to say, backing up to the last email real quick.
Thanks to our new thingy on Operator 11, that is definitely a possibility.
And that was all done on the laptop, so I can haul that thing over to Jamie's house and we can have ourselves some TurboGrafx playing broadcast.
So we are going to look into doing that in the future.
Yes, Jamie?
Yes.
This must happen.
And it does have the audio.
It's not very good, but it does have the audio.
We could have ways around that.
Yes.
With proper editing.
There are ways.
We have the technology.
We can...
Build it.
Okay, if you build it, they will come.
We'll see.
Also, I want to say about the next email, what would you guys want to see in a game like that?
A Super Smash Bros.
game with movie characters.
Chatroom, that's open to you guys, too.
Just out of curiosity.
It's too bad we already have a topic for tonight's list list.
This would be a good one.
What are you eating?
Ice cream.
That's what I ran out to get.
I want ice cream.
Let's see.
What characters from movies would be good?
How about some of the characters from Kill Bill, of course?
Brokeback Mountain, Mikla Tom?
I don't know if that would work.
Who would fight in Brokeback Mountain?
Would the two guys switch out?
There was already a fight in that movie.
Was there?
Yeah.
A little bit.
Oh, could you use a tire iron as your special weapon?
I got food in my mouth.
Anyway, never mind.
This was a bad idea.
Oh, wait.
We got the chat room.
Thank God.
Kropotkin says, Silent Bob.
DJ Dark Knight says, what about Ricky Bobby?
Blood Man and Chronic.
Black Boy says, Rose McGowan from Planet Terror.
There you go.
David Bowie from Labyrinth.
With a special sidekick, his crotch.
Labyrinth versus Dark Crystal.
This must happen.
All right, next email, please.
David Bowie as the king of all cosmos.
That would work.
Oh, my God.
He does sort of look like that now, too, doesn't he?
He's still hot, though.
Greetings.
First of all, thanks for providing such an entertaining podcast on a weekly basis.
You're welcome.
Give me a dollar.
Hey, I'm the one who asks for a dollar every week.
I listen to it every week.
Okay, give me five dollars.
Rob!
If you're not going to share, don't eat in front of us.
Oh, never mind.
It's caramel, and caramel sucks.
I'd rather have a taco.
It's dulce de leche, just so you know.
Yuck.
Read the email, lady.
That's what we pay you to do.
Shane's making me laugh.
I can't stop.
First of all, okay, I already read all that.
Oh, I listen to it every week and it makes my drive to work that much more tolerable.
Sorry about this week.
I hope we didn't run you off the road.
I want to read the email, Rob.
I have a bunch of them.
I want to interrupt you, Jamie.
I want you to kiss my ass, but not.
It's funny because it's all in the email, this conversation.
No, it is not.
Shane said it was on the email.
It's not.
A little background.
I've been playing video games for over 28 years.
I am now 35 and have a family, which probably is a little different from your main audience.
I also recognize that a lot of the places you guys describe because I'm a Bay Area person as well.
Anywho, I will try to keep this short, famous last words.
And I don't think you quite accomplished that, but oh well.
Regarding the discussion of Red Rings on Xbox 360, I completely understand Loki's frustration in regards to some fans or fanboys.
Commenting regarding the failure rate.
Countless forums and blogs have perpetuated this 33% failure rate as fact when in reality is merely a number drawn from a tired interview in Australia with some anonymous XEB game employees.
Someone's ass.
Yeah.
While I wouldn't care if fanboys or other systems believe this themselves, I am irritated with misinformation spread around and influence potential buyers to not buy one because of false rumors.
Of course, I am in an awkward position actually agreeing with Loki as he tirelessly attacks the Mac.
Just kidding.
I am a Mac fan, though, and even worked for Apple for a time.
Isn't that amazing how many Mac fans we have that stick with this show even though Loki, you know, bashes Apple products when he can?
Just because I don't like them doesn't mean you shouldn't like them.
I'm giving you my opinion and you're like, well, we should all think like you.
Way to be sheep.
Your Mac made me want to die last night.
You know, if you didn't challenge my opinion, then, you know, you would just be sheep.
Why did my Mac make you want to die last night?
Because you actually need to put AIM on that.
Why?
Use Mebo.
I hate Mebo.
I hate you.
I hate you back.
Email.
No, you were mean to me, Rob.
I'm going to leave now.
Bye.
Do you want some ice cream?
Yuck.
Are you trying to make my butt bigger?
What kind of ice cream?
Play online.
My question for all of you is how much do you truly enjoy playing with strangers online?
Oh, I love strangers.
DarkCharger
I don't like to play with strangers online either my mommy told me not to talk to strangers especially on Xbox Live once in a great while I will but I totally use that feedback feature if I have to so okay and which I will not read online as per your request thank you for your PS oh yes I saw that too the PS is freaking rad especially since well my other hobbies ah fair dear yes my other hobbies anyway next email
This is from Robert M. Just two quick thoughts.
One, I almost hope Uwe Boll announces plans to make a movie based on Manhunt and is immediately sued by you-know-who.
That particular clash of personalities would likely end in destruction of the career of one or both, seeing how neither would back down prior to that point.
Secondly, I was wondering if HMMJDS has only songs from the Disney show of the Hannah Montana game.
or stuff from the average non-fan of the show would recognize.
According to IGN, it does allow you to create your own music tracks.
Nothing about song lists, though, or if play-to-the-present music is even an option.
I don't know, but I'll try to find out.
I'd be surprised if it weren't.
And apparently... Is Footy Monster our resident Hannah Montana fan in chat tonight?
I do see he is, so maybe he can answer that.
I don't know.
Nobody loves Hannah Montana more than Footy Monster.
Um...
The next email, hi guys, MiserCrazy, I guess that's how it's pronounced here.
I'm new to your podcast and I think you guys are funny as hell, especially DarkSakura, you crack me up.
Oh, thank you.
I crack lots of people up when I have a mallet.
Anyway, I was wondering if any of you would know if there are any plans for Nintendo on releasing any TurboGrafx-16 CD-ROM or Super CD games on the virtual console, like Splash Lake, Monster Lair, or Dracula X. Oh God, I love you already.
Can you think of any Turbo CD games that you'd like to see on the Virtual Console?
Thanks and keep up the good work.
Um, I'm just going to say knees are crazy.
Since he actually put his name in the email, but.
Um, I would love to see, um, the Valus series on, um, on, uh, um, it was, it wasn't a super, it was just one of the, the, um, this regular Sega CD games.
Um,
I would actually love to see Sapphire.
It was a game that was one of the arcade CDs.
It was actually one of the first polygon-based shooters.
Very, very, very good game.
I am by no means an expert on these old CD-based systems, so I will simply say Night Trap and leave it at that.
That wasn't even on the TurboGrafx.
Well, it should have been.
No, because Night Trap kind of sucked ass.
Okay, it sucked a lot of ass, but it had Dana Plato in it.
I'd love to see Rondo of Blood out there.
I was a little distracted during that previous email because I was trying to talk to FootyMonster in the chat room.
I heard us say his name on the show, but he was too busy looking at porn to hear what the question was.
And FootyMonster did finally, after I clarified with him, he says, It's not known right now what music is in the Hannah Montana game, but I'm guessing it will be from the show.
At least that's what the big hairy guy on the stage said.
The big hairy guy on the show?
In the porn or in the Hannah Montana thing?
Just kidding.
Okay.
More email.
God, there's a bunch of really long ones.
Iken has email.
God, seriously.
Okay, this one says, call me Surtur.
Okay.
Hi, Surtur.
Every Monday morning I wake up and my magical PSP has downloaded the latest OLR podcast.
I can listen to it on the way to work.
I've been playing Jeanne d'Arc.
It is a strategy RPG based on the Joan of Arc story.
Who says the PSP doesn't have great games?
I don't know.
I think I've said that before.
That would be Shane saying that.
Thanks again for the show every week
Rondo of blah, blah, blah.
All right.
And Brooktown.
And Brooktown?
No, no Brooktown.
I'll pass on that.
Cake land.
All right.
Anyway.
Hello, this is Kropotkin from Kropotkin and Hendrix Game Review Show.
That's cool.
Hi.
He's in our chat room tonight.
And that's the show that's sandwiched in between us when we have our rebroadcast on all games.
That's hot.
Yes.
I've been listening to your shows while traveling to and from where picture of my place of work is below.
Okay.
The email that we use is non-HTML, so sorry.
Dope.
and thought I'd drop you a line considering the lack of email you've been getting recently.
That's the one week.
Oh, and yes, that is the... Oh, okay, I'm going to skip on past the location stuff because it says I can't show that.
You know, since this email is coming from a British listener, I think you should read this in an accent.
No.
No, I'm not, because I'm tired and I have a concussion.
I think you should read it within a spot of accents.
I don't care if you have a concussion.
Oh, no.
So yes, my email topic, what do you think is going to... I'm not reading it!
I don't care how you read it, just read the damn email!
Excuse me, Shane, hi!
Then remove him from the studio!
This is horrible radio!
Tell Shane to shush.
Shane, shush.
Email.
Now.
Okay, where was I?
So he gets me an email topic.
What do you think it's going to take to stop the gaming industry focus on the six-week window at the end of the year to sell games?
This year is just chronic for amazing titles being squeezed into this short period of time.
Just to give you an idea of how bad it is this year, take a look at the list.
Super Paper Mario, not out in Europe yet.
Metro Prime... Metro...
Metroid Prime 3, Super Mario Galaxy, Halo 3, PGR 4, Assassin's Creed, Crisis, Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4, Unreal Tournament 3, Ratchet & Clank, Tools of Destruction, World in Conflict, Haze, Heavenly Sword, Medal of Honor, Airborne, Sega Rally, Lost Odyssey, Ace Combat 6, Jericho, Enemy Territory, Quake Wars, Two Worlds.
Do you remember a game called Beyond Good and Evil?
It was a great game that appeared in Autumn of 2003.
I do remember that game, actually.
It was buried by many other less entertaining titles and undeservedly end up in the bargain bin.
Makes one wonder which out of the games will suffer a familiar fate.
So I ask you and the rest of the OLR team, when is the gaming industry going to wake up and realize that the video games can be released year-round and not just near Christmas time?
For what it's worth, my view on it is that when people stop seeing video games as only for children games, will this...
will cease to be holiday-only sale.
Sadly, I don't see that attitude changing anytime soon.
It's development cycles, I think.
If you look at it, of course they want to try to get as many sales in before their fiscal years are up.
That's why you see both Christmas and March as big times for games.
Right now, since I sell games at work, we work on order forms and that kind of thing.
For August, it was three pages long.
For October, it's about...
10 to 11 pages long, and November, I'm guessing, probably around 15 pages long.
So that kind of gives you an idea of how much stuff is coming out, and it just gets lumped into that week wherever the 15th of November falls, and then after that, drops down to nothing.
So it's more of the fault of the soccer moms of America than the gaming industry necessarily, right?
Because of all the holiday craziness?
Yeah.
Hmm.
But I mean, if a good game was released in April, or what's a dead month for gaming?
Like, probably April, May?
Super dead.
Okay, if a good game is released in April, I mean, shouldn't that still translate to good sales for the company year-round, right?
Yeah, I mean, look at, well, this April, there was Super Paper Mario and Guitar Hero 2 on the 360.
And those games sold awesome.
Another example of a slow month, July.
There was NCAA Football 08 and NASCAR.
and Mario Strikers, I guess.
But other than that, there wasn't a whole lot.
There's times now, during the summer, it's like, well, shit, there's nothing I really want to play for a while, whereas in the fall, it's like, crap, there's too much stuff.
I don't know what I want to play.
People aren't going to spend more money towards fall on games.
I think if they just spread out the releases all year long,
Dead Rising came out in August.
Really?
I thought.
No, I don't remember coming out late.
Sometimes you have the Oscar movies trying to push for awards or whatever, but you know, there's a lot of debt.
The same kind of cycle, because when do the consumers buy most of their movies?
During the summer when the kids aren't in school, right?
And then same thing with CDs.
CDs follow a very similar pattern to video games.
All the big CDs come out, what, September, October, November, up to the Christmas season, and then when you get into January, it's a dead month for the CD and music releases.
Of course, I'm not sure how online distribution changes all that, if at all, but...
Dead Rising was August 9th, 2006 Shall I move on to another email?
If you must
Dear OLR crew, after listening live last week, I went and downloaded the podcast and heard all the praise for Bioshock Go Around.
If Rob was so convinced to buy it, even though he wasn't a first-person shooter kind of guy, then by golly, it's something I need to take a look at.
I went and plunked down $200 on a video card the next day and stuck it in my computer, and the first thing I did was go and download the Bioshock demo.
Friggin' amazing.
I need this game right now, although paychecks not being till the end of the month preclude this.
Thanks to Rob for convincing me.
The only complaint I have is the movement is a little sluggish for my taste reminiscent of playing Halo on the PC.
I was looking for that run button everywhere.
on the 360 because of the awkwardness of dual analog input.
I imagine this allows for more precision, but I guess I just like my games at faster paced.
I thought the atmosphere was amazing with the voices and footsteps signaling there was something out there that you can't see.
Chilled me to the bones.
Of course, my friend who's a complete Counter-Strike addict played the demo and said, I can hear them from a mile away and if they didn't make any noise it'd be scarier when they popped out.
I don't think everything jumped out.
There was one section in the game where there were pipes that were breaking that was freezing people.
and so like I was picking up some plasmid or something I turned around there's this guy just standing there I'm like holy shit and killed him but it was a corpse so I think it's a good mix of both that scares me I mean not too much of one or the other I think creepy noises can be very creepy and then you know the the boos and like a scary movie is the same way right a good scary movie has a little mix of both your jump out of your seat moments as well as your builds up are you shaking your head in disagreement Mikotov yes whoa don't stick that right in my mouth um
I would say that the atmospheric scary is way better than the pop out of nowhere scary even though in the Silent Hill PSP demo I did jump a couple times because of the stupid pop out of nowhere sort of scariness but I feel that's a cheap thrill whereas the noises and the atmosphere stuff is way better and you've
I think I would say that the atmosphere adds to the pop-outs.
It makes it even more scary.
I tried to play Bioshock PC, but my video card couldn't handle it.
Cry?
I have to say that I prefer the atmosphere setup.
I really love psychological stuff.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I've seen tragedies that Gross fits in with.
I think that a good horror movie or game is something that you don't really know it's meant to be scary, I think, where you think it's just situational and then when something completely unexpected happens, not the jumping out, but when you hear the noises and then you think, oh, well, it's going to be this thing and it turns out to be something completely different.
I like the twist, especially when it messes with your head.
Battle Royale was funny too.
Huh?
Nothing, I was saying that Battle Royale wasn't scary, it was funny.
I think Silence of the Lambs is a way better movie than something like Saw.
Silence of the Lambs is really good.
But anyway.
Hey OLR, it's me, Solar Wing.
I can't be in the chat tonight as work frowns upon me using their internet for live radio stream and such.
I just wanted to start this off by saying thank you.
OLR saved my sanity and possibly me saying something I'd regret.
I took a short trip out to Alberta to see some family and go back to my past.
Of course, there was the obligatory meeting of the cousins.
To describe them, they are blonde valley girls who by some freak chance of nature have more than one brain cell and can pull high marks out of their pretentious asses.
I brought my DS and my PSP, but I couldn't get the meeting out of my head.
I was going over what I would say in the morning.
Okay, some of the wording is a little bit odd here.
Before I do that, I listened to the podcast I'd previously downloaded.
I brought 21-odd casts and listened to about 8 for a bit, but I was getting more annoyed.
But then I started to listen to your show and I started to calm down.
The humor and pacing was perfect for what I needed, which was to calm the hell down.
I forgot all about the night and simply enjoyed the show.
For that, I'm truly thankful, and the only thing that I can suggest is adding the catchphrase vehicular homicide is wrong even if they are your cousins.
Vehicular Homicide is great, especially if they're your cousins.
I don't understand, because how is this show calming?
Because this show has me more on edge tonight.
I think it's because we're distracting.
I guess.
And if you don't think about the crap that's pissing you off, then maybe you feel better.
Because tonight's show makes me want to do vehicular manslaughter on my cousins.
You're mean to me, Rob.
You're so mean.
Whatever.
Get over it, baby.
Imagine not being a baby.
All right.
Are there more emails?
No, there's just this one.
Oh my god!
How many freaking emails did we get this week?
You do know we like to finish the show in like three hours, right?
I'm reading the rest of this.
Hush.
Alright.
Rub.
No.
To bring this back to video game talk, before I left for my trip, it's tradition I buy a new game, so I've been holding out and getting Phoenix Wright 2, as I've never...
Played the first one.
I would like to play them in order.
I picked it up but didn't open it.
Well, I was out there and had a chance to go around the area and found an EB.
We went in and I found the first Phoenix Wright for less than $50.
It was the lowest bidding off of eBay before I left.
It was actually $34 Canadian with tax.
Alberta only has like 6% tax compared to 15%.
So I picked that up and have almost beaten it.
This game is at least a must-rent if you have a DS.
From there we went to the West Edmonton Mall and I found ourselves in an arcade where for the first time I saw Guitar Freaks in Dromania.
I can now agree that Guitar Hero wasn't original, but did a lot of things right.
Now listening to the last week's show, I have some questions for you.
The Smash Bros.
site has been updating their site daily and I only have to say I can't wait for this game to come out, but do you think they will have
Run on sentences are very, very hard to follow.
Now I know why when I read the email you said I'm like Jamie when I was yelling about their grammar and stuff.
Let me put it this way.
As much as I'd like to see online, I think there's going to be as much online as there is punctuation in this email.
I wish they would go online with it, and I wish maybe that would be a big surprise Nintendo's going to pull out of their butt.
Come, uh, you know, the end of the year.
Maybe it'll be a big E for All announcement since nobody else is going to announce anything at E for All.
I don't know.
But I'm, I'm not holding my breath.
Super paraphrasing powers activate!
Okay, yes.
Okay.
Um, this one's for you and me, Rob.
Since we both played Ragnarok Online, which I think is funny to being referred to, um, a.k.a.
Fisher Price, my first MMORPG.
Okay.
he and his sister quit their crippling RO addiction and they're on the way to the 13 RO, the 13 steps what is a good MMO to play?
she suggested World of Warcraft but she says it looks complicated World of Warcraft's not that complicated try Rose Online Rose Online I don't know that one um
Puzzle Pirates Tetranet
PSU is crap!
Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap.
I suggest if you're going to play one of the Phantasy Star MMOs, go for Blue Burst because it's a lot better and you can actually use a force in that game without having to retardedly crap it.
Dark Knight says, stop hating.
I can hate all I want to.
It's a free country.
That was great.
Shane says to play a better game.
He wants our Wii codes, but we'll have to put them back up.
Anyway.
Jamie is awesome.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
In both the original and evolved versions But you get 60 Atari 2600 classics That's right, 70 games in one Hell yeah That's a lot of games That is a lot of games I want 70 versions of Metal Slug There probably will be someday Give it time One day, one day
Yars Revenge, Night Driver, Canyon Bomber, Crystal Castles
Crystal Castles is great.
Crystal Castles is pretty rad.
But I don't know.
I feel like a lot of these classics, I've already played to death elsewhere.
I don't know.
I don't know if I can get that excited about it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Those weren't the evolved titles.
Those are just some random titles they were saying.
Can I play over the internet or with other people?
You can play with other people Wi-Fi.
And it will also have an online leaderboard.
So, and what else?
Actually, it says, oh yeah, you can just compare scores.
I was going to say, hopefully it has it over the internet, but the evolved titles, I guess.
Asteroids, Asteroids, Deluxe, Battlezone, Centipede, Lunar Lander, Millipede, Missile Command, Super Breakout, Tempest, Warlords, and Pong.
Wow, super evolved Pong.
I can't wait for that.
Hey, they had Tempest in there.
Yeah, Tempest is cool.
I saw you playing Space Giraffe earlier, Miklatov, while we were done, so what did you think?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Liss, Rock Band, Guitar Hero 3
10 new songs were announced this week, including Ruby by the Kaiser Chiefs, Radio Song by Superbuss, and Minus Celsius by the Backyard Babies.
I've not heard of a lot of these bands, but apparently it's some more international flavor, so hooray for diversity.
Wait, wait, wait.
What was the first one that you mentioned?
Kaiser Chiefs.
That's the only one I've heard of from the list.
No, you mentioned... Sorry, it must have been the second one then.
Oh, hell.
Superbuss?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I closed the list.
Don't worry about it.
Superbus, that was it.
That's pretty cool.
Also coming to Rock Band, some songs you might know a little more in-depth stateside, such as The Rolling Stones with Gimme Shelter, The Clash, Should I Stay or Should I Go?
I like that song.
Smashing Pumpkins with Cherub Rock, Nine Inch Nails, The Hand That Feeds, Beastie Boys, Sabotage, and one of my favorites, Radiohead with Creep.
Because I'm a creep, I'm a winner Anyway
I like Cherub Rock in the game I like Smashing Pumpkins Smashing Pumpkins is cool I guess So speaking of Guitar Hero 3 though moving on to other games that are trying to be like other games Guitar Hero 3 is going to have a demo inside the Xbox 360 version of Tony Hawk's Proving Ground It actually will be released in the UK on October 9th and the demo will be included with it before it makes it onto Xbox Live
So, they're saying that what's going to be listed is Laid Down by Priestess, Even Flow by Pearl Jam, The Metal by Tenacious D. I love Tenacious D. Hit Me With Your Best Shot, As Made Famous by Pat Benatar, and a cover of Rock You Like a Hurricane.
What are the Scorpions doing anyway?
Why can't they just use the tracks?
Stinging people?
No.
God.
Well,
That's great news, but here's something even funnier.
In the ongoing battle between Sony and, I guess, PSP hackers over firmware control, you know, who will dominate, I think the hackers may have actually launched the final blow.
PANDORA'S BATTERY
to actually create your own debug battery.
So with that and a combination with a PSP memory stick, you can downgrade, you can unbrick any PSP, no matter the firmware.
So that's pretty awesome.
Nice.
It will downgrade anything to 1.5.
If you have a bricked PSP from failed whatever, it will fix it.
Now how much is this puppy going to cost?
Nothing.
It's free to download.
Okay.
Yeah, you download the program, you run it on your PC.
All you need is a PSP battery to create this debug battery.
You can return the battery back to its normal mode afterwards if you'd like.
The only thing you will need, though, is to create this device, you will need one of the custom firmwares.
But, I mean, if you have a friend that has that, you create this, and then you're good to go on any PSP.
Hooray, Kid Icarus on my PSP again!
and all that stuff, but you know,
Show a little homebrew love.
Little bit.
Little bit.
Anyhow, moving on to a title that was creating a lot of news in recent weeks on the program, Manhunt 2.
A lot of folks thought this game was dead in the water.
It's going away.
No more are we going to see this because you just can't fix the game down from an A.O.
rating.
Well, guess what?
It has been modified down to an M-rated version and Manhunt 2 will be out on the PlayStation 2, PSP, and Wii on Halloween, October 31, 2007.
What a hilarious day to release this game.
A quote from Rockstar founder and president Sam Houser, quote, Manhunt 2 is important to us, and we're glad it can finally be appreciated as a gaming experience.
Manhunt 2 is a powerful piece of interactive storytelling that is a unique video game experience.
We think horror fans will love it.
Nowhere, though, has it been said what exactly they had to change.
I mean, obviously they've scaled down some of the violence, perhaps, but as to specifics, your guess is as good as mine.
They added bunnies.
I hope all they did was submit a different video to the ESRB.
Well, they have to play the game, don't they now?
When I was still at Konami, we still just did videos.
So, who knows?
I hope they don't have to cut anything because I want that game.
What they did is they changed all the blood to sweat.
Or all the blood to fire, remember, because it's okay to burn people alive.
It's just not okay to have them bleed.
But there will be a secret blood code in the game that will restore all the blood from the original demo.
As will unlock a sex minigame as well.
Yes, and you can use your game genie to change the colors of the sweat as well to make the experience that much more realistic.
But sweat is great.
Right.
You know what I always thought was funny?
Because I've got the Samurai Shodown 2 at the Japanese cart for my Neo Geo.
If you switch it from Japanese to English mode, the blood changes color.
I'm not even joking.
You have the big spray of sweat, and then you change it into the big spray of blood.
If I developed video games, I would actually put a code that changes the blood into sweat just to be funny.
Like to make reference to the old school Super Nintendo Mortal Kombat.
That was fantastic.
Okay, anyway.
How about something regarding Eidos?
Okay.
And something that I love, which is Highlander.
Because however many shows are based off of cutting people's heads off, not too many.
Not a lot that I can think of.
Buffy, kind of.
That's staking or cutting their head off.
One and a half.
One and a half, I agree with that.
I love Buffy.
Angel, not so much because he was a whiny bitch.
Anyway.
Okay.
There can be only one.
There can be only one.
It's a third-person action game that will cross 2,000 years from feudal Japan, from Scotland in the old days, Pompeii, New York in the future, and you go all over the place cutting off people's heads.
Sadly, I think this is going to be timed with a new movie that's coming out.
Yeah, they're making another Highlander movie.
I hope the wizard's face isn't in it, because that man is lying.
He almost kills everybody.
Do you understand?
Stop it, Rob.
I am Conor McCloud of the Clan McCloud.
I was born in 1518 in the village of Glenfinnan on the shores of Loch Shield.
Now I am immortal.
Okay, my favorite line in the first one is when he keeps calling Ramirez an overblown haggis.
I am Juan Sanchez Villalobos Ramirez.
Chief Metallurgist to King Charles V of Spain, and I'm at your service.
Why does he sound Scottish if he's Spanish?
It also left a man's decapitated body lying on the floor next to his own severed head.
A head which at this time has no name.
I know his name.
His name is Mr. Heady.
Anyway.
You play Owen McCloud, and you fight 77 other people.
And you have 18 missions so far.
You get to play with zip wires, daggers, free falls, swan dives.
It will be pretty gory, pretty mature.
And also, you can use, you have a choice of three weapons, a katana, claymore, or a, I guess, double?
On the Wii?
On the Wii?
On the Wii?
I can actually slice people's heads.
I said from the beginning, PS3, 360, or PC.
Don't.
But you also get powers.
I don't remember any of them having actual powers.
Alright.
Other than, oh my god, I sense danger.
It's another immortal.
Let's kill him.
Alright, well let's go ahead and take a quick break.
This segment's ran on long enough, that's for sure.
We're going to take a quick break, and when we come back from this break, more of Orange Lounge Radio with our Part B. We're going to talk a little bit about Metroid Prime 3, a little bit about Super Mario Galaxy, the Penny Arcade game for Xbox Live Arcade, and a listless for tonight.
