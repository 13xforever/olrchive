7000	14000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco.
14000	20000	Tonight, August 19th, 2007, the Wii and the 360 are the same price in one country,
20000	27000	Guitar Hero 3 gets a little poisoned, and is a Wiimote coming to the Playstation 2?
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36000	42000	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-host, Dark Sakura.
48000	49000	Hi.
49000	50000	How are you doing, Miss Jamie Summers?
50000	51000	I'm here.
51000	53000	You're here? You're alive and well?
53000	54000	Yes, quite.
54000	55000	All is good in the hood?
55000	56000	And not hungover.
56000	61000	Yes, I got to watch Dark Sakura get drunk last night.
61000	62000	I'll drink everybody.
62000	63000	And no hangover?
63000	64000	No hangover.
64000	65000	Amazing.
65000	67000	Do you remember what you drank? Can you run down real quick?
67000	74000	Yes, I can. I had a shot of cold sake. I had 28 ounces of Kirin beer.
74000	84000	I had six martinis, two of them being pom-tinis, one key lime pie, and Adam and Eve, because it was very tasty, it was apple.
84000	91000	I had a guavatini. I had, what was that? Oh, God, I can't remember the first one. The chocolate martini.
91000	97000	And then I had a shot of Glenlivet scotch.
97000	101000	And then I had some of that amaretto sour and tried a bunch of everybody else's drinks.
101000	102000	So a lot. A lot.
102000	104000	Oh, yeah. I know that's exactly what I had.
104000	107000	Now, just a note to the kiddies out there. Jamie didn't drive.
107000	110000	No, I passed out in the back of the car.
110000	115000	She's over the age of 21. I drove. I didn't really drink anything. So if you're going to drink, you have to drink responsibly.
115000	117000	Lecture, lecture, lecture.
117000	118000	And drink a lot of water when you do.
118000	122000	That's right. All right. Also joining us, say hello to Loki.
122000	123000	Hello.
123000	124000	Who did not join us last night.
124000	125000	No, I did not.
125000	131000	All right. That's all right. You weren't invited because it was a bachelorette party, so straight men don't get to go to bachelorette parties, unfortunately.
131000	132000	Rob went to mine.
132000	135000	But he's a straight man.
135000	136000	Yeah, exactly.
136000	138000	I know. I was saying you went to mine. I invited you.
138000	144000	I was like, by the way, my boyfriend got very, very drunk last night, and yeah, Jamie definitely out drank him.
144000	145000	I'm like next to nothing.
145000	148000	Out drank him. Anyway, nobody cares. They want to hear the video game chat.
148000	151000	Loki, what did you do last night? Maybe it was something gaming related.
151000	158000	Uh, no. Instead, I went and saw the movie Superbad, and it was awesome.
158000	159000	Was it good? I don't know.
159000	160000	I loved it.
160000	165000	I haven't seen, like, I think I saw, like, three-fourths of the 40-year-old virgin. I just never finished it, and then I didn't see that knocked up.
165000	171000	I wouldn't even compare it to it. It's not even anything like that. It's more like American Pie, but less retarded.
171000	173000	If you've ever seen Knocked Up...
173000	175000	You should put that on the poster. It's American Pie, but less retarded.
175000	182000	Well, if you've seen Knocked Up, it kind of has that same vibe to it. I mean, there's a lot of, you know, crude jokes and stuff like that,
182000	189000	but it's still very, you know, you don't go into it like, there's no real gross-out moments or anything like that.
189000	192000	It's just kind of, you can relate to it, I guess.
192000	194000	This is like freshman year type American Pie?
194000	200000	No, this is like, this is like, it's almost, the premise is almost like American Pie. They're trying to get laid.
200000	204000	You know, this is the last party that they're going to be able to go to before, you know, they're in college,
204000	210000	and they're just trying to basically get alcohol for this party and stuff and hook up with these two girls,
210000	215000	because, I don't know, they, I guess they want to be...
215000	216000	Men.
216000	219000	Well-versed by the time they get to college.
219000	221000	That don't happen.
221000	224000	It was a good movie, and there's a lot of funny stuff in there.
224000	225000	So it wasn't like a gross-out comedy?
225000	229000	No, it wasn't a gross-out comedy, and they didn't really have any gross stuff in there.
229000	233000	Like, I didn't think that scene where the guy screwed a pie was that funny.
233000	234000	It was stupid.
234000	237000	That's stupid. No one does that. Nobody does that.
237000	239000	All right, well, let's go to the chat.
239000	243000	Our always present fourth guest is our chat room chat.orangelauntrady.com.
243000	244000	Lots of talk.
244000	247000	Jaded says, no, we don't want to hear the video game chat.
247000	249000	We want to hear the drunken people chat.
249000	252000	Well, I don't know. Some of our podcast subscribers might disagree with you,
252000	254000	so we will get to game chat very soon.
254000	258000	But, you know, I mean, you can read about the news pretty much anywhere on the internet,
258000	262000	but we like to put our personal touch on things and hear from you guys.
262000	265000	That's why we always invite you guys to chat.orangelauntrady.com.
265000	269000	RossdielUT says, crude jokes does not equal good comedy.
269000	273000	And Sephiroth1215 says, super bad was okay. I was laughing the whole time.
273000	274000	There you go.
274000	277000	And especially, you know, there's a whole...
277000	284000	I don't want to ruin it, but there's a part where you find out that one of the characters had a really bad habit
284000	288000	in, like, when he was growing up, and it had to do with doodling things,
288000	293000	and that part, it's super funny when they show it, and then after the credits,
293000	295000	there's more of that stuff, and it's hilarious.
295000	297000	Okay, I'll take your word for it.
297000	301000	Now, okay, so to bring things back to video games and we transition to how was your gaming week,
301000	303000	could there be a super bad video game?
303000	306000	Because, you know, as movies do very good, sometimes they get turned into video games.
306000	310000	There's not. There's a Napoleon Dynamite game coming out.
310000	313000	I was just thinking, I was like, speaking of things that jump the shark,
313000	315000	I'm really surprised there's not a Napoleon Dynamite game.
315000	316000	There is.
316000	317000	Really?
317000	321000	It's DS and PSP, and it looks stupid. Horrible.
321000	323000	Sweet.
323000	326000	It's like, I mean, it's not even coming out remotely.
326000	329000	It's not like an anniversary of that movie or anything like that.
329000	333000	It's just, oh, by the way, we decided, you know, let's make a movie for this,
333000	336000	or a game for this that's, you know, years after the movie.
336000	338000	Oh, if there's one thing.
338000	340000	Gosh.
340000	344000	If there's one thing I really hate, it is video games based on shitty movies that shouldn't be turned into video games.
344000	346000	They should do Xanadu the game.
346000	348000	Now, that might be okay, actually.
348000	350000	But it has to be all animated by Don Bluth.
350000	353000	Because sometimes when movies are so bad, they're kind of good.
353000	355000	Like Showgirls the game, I'd buy that.
355000	359000	There's a Betty Boop game coming out in fucking October.
359000	363000	It's like, come on! Seriously, you missed the boat a long time ago with that.
363000	366000	Aren't we past the 1930s high?
366000	369000	It's like no one watches Betty Boop anymore.
369000	370000	Tell that to Timeless River.
370000	372000	Oh.
372000	373000	Alright.
373000	374000	But that was Disney.
374000	376000	Alright, let's get into a little bit of how was your gaming week.
376000	378000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
378000	381000	It was Final Fantasy-ish.
381000	387000	Because I played Final Fantasy Advance 6 in your car a little, to show it to you.
387000	390000	And I played at the gym.
390000	396000	I beat the first area, the first town, in the gym.
396000	398000	Which means you have like 49 more hours to go.
398000	399000	Shit.
399000	402000	But it's not Pokemans.
402000	404000	No, I love Final Fantasy 6.
404000	406000	I mean, obviously, many people will tell you.
406000	412000	You know, most people would say the best Final Fantasy game ever was either 7 or 6.
412000	414000	Two. Japanese 2 or English 2?
414000	415000	Japanese 2 or 5.
415000	416000	Really?
416000	418000	I like the job systems.
418000	419000	Yeah, I'll give you that.
419000	420000	I don't know.
420000	422000	I still have a soft spot for 4.
422000	424000	But I think that's just because that was my first one.
424000	425000	You spoon-y bard.
425000	426000	Yes, and you spoon-y bard.
426000	427000	But anyway.
427000	428000	But, but, but, but, but, but.
428000	430000	I touched it today.
430000	431000	What?
431000	432000	Final Fantasy 6?
432000	433000	No.
433000	434000	What?
434000	435000	Super Metroid.
435000	438000	I picked up my Super Nintendo today and was going to pack it up and bring it over here.
438000	439000	And then Dan informs me,
439000	440000	Oh, we're lending that to Adam.
440000	444000	Thank God you got it on the second guess, because the third guess wasn't much better
444000	445000	for me.
445000	450000	For the record, I do own Kirby's Avalanche.
450000	452000	So there.
452000	453000	Alright.
453000	457000	And Super, I was just saying, Super Metroid comes out on Virtual Console next week, but
457000	458000	you were like,
458000	459000	No!
459000	461000	That was exactly the noise you made when I said it was coming out on Virtual Console.
461000	462000	You were like,
462000	463000	No, we're playing the real one.
463000	465000	Even though the emulation on Wii is pretty good.
465000	466000	We're playing the real one.
466000	467000	We're going to play the real one.
467000	468000	Jamie and I failed.
468000	470000	Either that or I have to see if my Hori pad will work.
470000	474000	We failed to have our Super Metroid night, but we are going to have it soon.
474000	476000	We've said we're going to have it very soon.
476000	479000	Well, they have those pads you can get that are actually converted.
479000	485000	They're modded real pads that you can plug into, like the classic controller to the Wii,
485000	489000	so you can play these games on the actual pads.
489000	492000	I can just bring my Super Nintendo and play the actual game on the actual system.
492000	495000	For the people who don't have a Super Nintendo.
495000	500000	Go to your local flea market and pay $5.
500000	502000	I'm just going to chat and reading some stuff here.
502000	505000	Son of Dad is talking about movie based games.
505000	507000	Remember the Nacho Libre game?
507000	508000	Yes, unfortunately I do.
508000	509000	Thankfully I don't.
509000	510000	I don't think I played that.
510000	511000	That was on the DS.
511000	514000	What other crap is coming out?
514000	517000	Arctic Tale, which for those who may not know,
517000	521000	Arctic Tale is going to be a brand new movie, kind of like March of the Penguins,
521000	523000	except with polar bears and seals.
523000	525000	Or what was the other one they had?
525000	526000	Happy Feet.
526000	528000	Happy Feet sucked.
528000	530000	The movie was okay, but the game sucked.
530000	532000	But at least Happy Feet was not a documentary, though.
532000	535000	There was singing and dancing in there,
535000	540000	so you can kind of turn that into a pretty good game, I guess.
540000	543000	Tiger Claw says, Sky, what about the Alvin and the Chipmunks games?
543000	545000	It's going to be kind of like Guitar Hero.
545000	548000	Yeah, but Alvin and the Chipmunks, so that's another movie tie-in game.
548000	550000	It's going to be crap.
550000	551000	Here's the thing.
551000	555000	The new Alvin and the Chipmunks makes me want to throw up in my mouth.
555000	558000	When I saw the poster, it looks like crap.
558000	562000	And I just never liked the original to begin with, to be honest.
562000	565000	That's not one thing from my childhood I fondly remember.
565000	566000	Dude, Jason Lee.
566000	567000	I think they were kind of stupid.
567000	568000	Jason Lee is such a sellout now.
568000	572000	I mean, seriously, what the fuck happened since the View Askew days?
572000	574000	I liked My Name is Earl.
574000	578000	Okay, I don't like that show, but credit to that at least.
578000	580000	That's a little different, but come on.
580000	583000	I mean, seriously, Alvin and Chipmunks shit?
583000	586000	I mean, now we're getting back into movie podcasting.
586000	587000	Let's get back to the games.
587000	589000	Was there anything else you wanted to share?
589000	590000	My Name is Earl is a TV show.
590000	592000	And the only reason I saw that is because you were there.
592000	595000	They were watching it at my Fourth of July party.
595000	598000	The only game that I think this year that's going to be any good
598000	600000	that's tied in with sort of a movie,
600000	603000	and it's not even really based on a movie, the Simpsons game,
603000	605000	is going to be fucking awesome.
605000	606000	That is it.
606000	609000	That is the only game I'm buying this year that's tied in with a movie.
609000	612000	Oh, wait, except for the Harry Potter game, which I bought that for Nellie, though.
612000	615000	By the way, do you have to point out what we're discussing in the chatroom right now
615000	619000	as the benefits of emulation?
619000	623000	Because I just said emulation for the lose.
623000	627000	You know, because I prefer playing the actual game on the actual.
627000	628000	That's just how I've always been.
628000	631000	But there is a good point to emulation.
631000	633000	Translated Japanese RPGs.
633000	635000	Seiken Densetsu 3.
635000	637000	The quintessential translated game you must play.
637000	640000	Where they went and translated the graphics in the game.
640000	644000	Or Final Fantasy V before Square brought it over here.
644000	645000	That was the other biggie.
645000	647000	I had a very, very well translated.
647000	651000	Or even I had a translated panorama cotton once.
651000	653000	That is not very good.
653000	655000	The other good thing I think about emulation is that
655000	659000	for most of us that don't have the big bucks to spend on the real thing,
659000	663000	it kind of lets you play the old classic games that time forgot.
663000	666000	Now we have Virtual Console and Game Tap.
666000	667000	Yeah, which is cool.
667000	669000	And I support both of those, as you know if you listen to the show.
669000	670000	And the Ninja Pass.
670000	672000	For any length of my time.
672000	674000	Anything else you want to share for your gaming week?
674000	675000	No.
675000	676000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
676000	678000	I tried to play as much as possible.
678000	680000	I played Casarone a little bit.
680000	681000	The demo for that.
681000	683000	And it's pretty interesting actually.
683000	685000	I could kind of get into it.
685000	688000	Because I know Nelly's been hooked on Catan.
688000	691000	And I had to literally drag the 360 to a different room.
691000	694000	So that I could actually play some games on it.
694000	695000	So that was pretty cool.
695000	699000	And then of course the one demo everyone's been playing this week
699000	700000	would be Bioshock.
700000	702000	And I tried that and it's awesome.
702000	705000	So awesome that I decided to pre-order my game after I played it.
705000	712000	And then, see here, also played some more Beautiful Katamari.
712000	714000	All three minutes of it.
714000	718000	And then, let's see, I played Overlord some more.
718000	720000	And that's actually been pretty fun.
720000	721000	I was pretty surprised.
721000	723000	I thought I'd get tired of the game pretty quick.
723000	727000	And kind of hesitated to purchase it originally.
727000	729000	But I'm actually very satisfied with the game.
729000	730000	It's pretty fun.
730000	734000	And it's really the game itself.
734000	735000	You try to be good in it.
735000	738000	And I think it's harder to be good in the game than evil.
738000	741000	But after a while, the NPCs just really piss you off.
741000	743000	And you just go and decide to kill everybody.
743000	745000	And that's the way you should do it, I think.
745000	750000	Other than that, I played me and my Katamari on the PSP.
750000	754000	And tried to remind myself why I hated it on the PSP in the first place.
754000	756000	And that would be the controls.
756000	761000	They suck balls without having a second analog stick on there.
761000	765000	And then, of course, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.
765000	771000	Because for some reason, we're glutton for punishment with that game.
771000	773000	I don't know how this is fucking possible.
773000	778000	But the game actually glitches in new ways.
778000	782000	It just progressively evolves into a worse game.
782000	783000	And I don't know why.
783000	785000	It's just weird.
785000	789000	It's like a guy's own conscience or something.
789000	791000	It just fucking gets worse.
791000	793000	And I don't know how.
793000	794000	But it does.
794000	799000	And yet, we'll still play it until they release another fucking Grand Theft Auto game that has multiplayer.
799000	803000	I think that's all I played.
803000	807000	Oh, I played track and field. Hated.
807000	808000	Do you like it?
808000	809000	Nah, think carefully.
809000	810000	For me, it's dumb fun.
810000	814000	I mean, it's totally a brainless type of game, track and field.
814000	819000	I still haven't bought the full retail one, but I've played the old school one on the computer.
819000	821000	I know it was in the arcade at one time.
821000	822000	Yeah, it was.
822000	824000	I remember playing an arcade one long time ago.
824000	827000	But they should remake it into the arcade with a DDR pad type thing.
827000	829000	I think that would be a little bit more...
829000	830000	Like sports bars or something.
830000	831000	Konami has both.
831000	833000	Yeah.
833000	835000	My Gaming Week.
835000	837000	Not a lot of new stuff to try out this week.
837000	842000	Obviously, there's Madden, but sports games are typically not my cup of tea, so I passed on that.
842000	844000	So, just kind of playing the old stuff.
844000	845000	World of Warcraft.
845000	846000	Boom Boom Rocket.
846000	847000	Oh yeah, I played that too.
847000	848000	What?
848000	849000	Boom Boom Rocket?
849000	850000	Oh, World of Warcraft.
850000	851000	How'd that go for you?
851000	852000	You were here.
852000	853000	Oh, yeah, that's right.
853000	854000	Dur.
854000	855000	Anyway, let's see.
855000	858000	What else did I play?
858000	862000	Echo the Dolphin I downloaded and tried out on Xbox Live.
862000	866000	And I have to admit, I thought the game was overrated when I first played it many years ago.
866000	867000	I think it's overrated now.
867000	869000	I'm not a fan of the Echo series.
869000	872000	I never understood why people love that so much.
872000	873000	You're breaking my heart.
873000	874000	They need Calibri.
874000	875000	I'm sorry.
875000	876000	I didn't like Calibri either.
876000	881000	I played Hexic 2 just to see if the sequel was any better than the first one, because
881000	882000	I didn't really care for the first one too much.
882000	883000	The first one's kind of fun.
883000	886000	I found the second one to be easier, actually.
886000	887000	It was weird.
887000	888000	Really?
888000	890000	That's a good thing, because the first one is really hard.
890000	895000	Yeah, I was able to create a lot of, I don't remember what they are, but basically create
895000	898000	some sort of ring thing and it turns into something else.
898000	900000	Yeah, you can tell you play a lot of that game.
900000	902000	I don't like that it's not free, though.
902000	904000	That's the only thing.
904000	908000	There's actually something I do need to mention that someone reminded me in the chat room.
908000	911000	We did have an instance of the M-word in my house as I left.
911000	912000	What?
912000	913000	Madden?
913000	915000	The M-word.
915000	917000	Oh my gosh.
917000	918000	Fucking annoying.
918000	919000	All right.
919000	920000	We need a real football game.
920000	925000	Okay, it's not the game that annoys you, I get the feeling, but it's your husband and
925000	928000	all his friends coming over and playing, though, that annoys you.
928000	929000	Guess what?
929000	933000	Later on, think-U-E-A, they decided, guess what, we're going to make two football games
933000	937000	a year, so now they're going to have NFL Tour, which is coming out in January.
937000	938000	Can I finish my game of the week?
938000	939000	Sorry.
939000	940000	Can I finish my game of the week?
940000	942000	That was the sound of the microphone being rammed into my head repeatedly.
942000	943000	Let's see.
943000	948000	Now, Dark Soccer, your heart is going to break a little more based on chat comments here.
948000	952000	Gold Banjo says, Echo the Dolphin isn't even worth an emulation download.
952000	954000	Yeah, your mom.
954000	959000	Sephiroth1215 says, I didn't like Echo, but I really like the Tides of Time.
959000	960000	Tides of Time was great.
960000	965000	RawsteelUT says, Echo would be good if it weren't harder than real-life nuclear warfare.
965000	967000	It wasn't that hard.
967000	970000	Hey, you know what that game really needs instead of being Echo the Dolphin?
970000	974000	They made a knockoff game, I think it's actually by the same people that created Echo, called
974000	975000	Laser Dolphin.
975000	976000	It was basically-
976000	977000	Cool!
977000	979000	It was Echo the Dolphin with a laser on its freaking head.
979000	981000	What the hell was that on Xbox Live?
981000	986000	It's on PC, but they had like, you know, turtles with rockets on them and stuff.
986000	990000	It was basically all the sea creatures with different artillery on them.
990000	993000	I mean, that's the only thing I can think that make that game any better.
993000	996000	Alright, so I instead played demos.
996000	999000	And here's the thing, like, BioShock, okay?
999000	1002000	Like, I was not getting excited about BioShock at all.
1002000	1008000	I'm just like, oh hooray, it's another first-person shooter, looks all sci-fi, doesn't really
1008000	1009000	look like a game I want to get into.
1009000	1014000	In fact, I even went and I posted on my Twitter, and I said, because I have a lot of gaming
1014000	1019000	people that I know on Twitter, other independent podcast people, among other things, and I
1019000	1024000	actually made a post on Twitter that said something about like, so what's the big deal,
1024000	1026000	oh here it is, so what's so awesome about BioShock?
1026000	1030000	I'm not knocking it, I'm just curious because usually I don't get too excited for first-person
1030000	1031000	shooters.
1031000	1036000	And then gamer Andy replied to me and said, frankly, it's the immersive environment jam-packed
1036000	1037000	with atmosphere and the story.
1037000	1038000	Irrational makes good games.
1038000	1042000	And then I'm reading all these reviews, like what, it has like a 99, a Metacritic?
1042000	1046000	I'm like, okay, I've got to see what's so frickin' fabulous about this game, right?
1046000	1050000	So I downloaded the demo, oh my god, it really is that good.
1050000	1055000	Like, if the demo is any sign of what the game is going to be, shit, that was a great
1055000	1056000	game.
1056000	1057000	That was amazing.
1057000	1059500	And here's something, okay, that I thought was very interesting, and I observed this
1059500	1063000	when I was playing, I also observed it when my friend was playing.
1063000	1066500	When you first, you know, you start off, you know, you crash land your plane and stuff
1066500	1071500	and the water effects, and you get out of the water, I literally turned around, looked
1071500	1076240	at the fire in the water, and I stood there and like stared at it for like 30 seconds.
1076240	1079500	My other friend had played it too, he's just like looking at it, I was like, damn, that
1079500	1081200	looks really good.
1081200	1085300	The graphics in this game are hands down like, you know, and I really don't like reviewing
1085300	1090000	a game based on the demo, so let me say that up front, but I think especially in this day
1090000	1094400	and age, you can use a demo as a pretty good sign of what's to come for the game.
1094400	1096600	And I don't think I've seen a better looking game, period.
1096600	1101160	I mean, the game looks like phenomenal, it's amazing, and it was scary.
1101160	1104600	I don't know though if I'll end up actually buying the full retail version just because
1104600	1107340	I'm so horrible at first person shooters.
1107340	1108840	I'm so bad at them.
1108840	1110200	I am too, but you know what?
1110200	1111240	I wouldn't be able to play it.
1111240	1112240	I purchased it.
1112240	1114920	I had to get the limited edition so I can get a little, you know, the big daddy for
1114920	1117020	my desk at work.
1117020	1121120	But I love the fact that, you know, you could like get fire hands and like set people on
1121120	1124280	fire, that was so gratifying, I loved it, so.
1124280	1127880	Bioshock really is that good, like even if you're not a fan of first person shooters,
1127880	1128880	try out the demo.
1128880	1129880	It was scary.
1129880	1130880	It was Silent Hill scary to me too.
1130880	1134120	Well remember, now two favorite parts for me in the demo.
1134120	1139800	The one was the chick with the baby stroller, when you walked up to her and she's all talking
1139800	1143920	about how she turned her baby and stuff into a little sister, and then there was another
1143920	1148680	one where it was the couple, that kind of reminded me of like a cruise ship, older couple
1148680	1150360	or something like that.
1150360	1156960	I mean when you kill the guy whose name is Harold or whatever, the crazy wife comes after
1156960	1157960	you with a gun.
1157960	1161680	It was just kind of cool, that whole immersion.
1161680	1167000	So the game looks, I mean, usually there's a part of me that wants to go, oh it can't
1167000	1168160	be that good.
1168160	1169160	It can't be that good.
1169160	1170440	Why is everybody praising this game?
1170440	1173960	It really, like you really have to try it, like seriously.
1173960	1181200	Anyway, going to chat room here, DarVoid says Bioshock demo is fun, Chainsaw Juggling says
1181200	1183320	it's the best game ever, I can't wait till Tuesday.
1183320	1187120	Sounds like they're going to have a hit on their hands there.
1187120	1194000	Joshi16 says damn, I want my Bioshock, interesting.
1194000	1195480	That was pretty much my gaming week.
1195480	1203480	One other demo I did try and played a little bit was Beautiful Katamari, which to me, it's
1203480	1210360	the same fucking game, same fucking game, I don't care, with half the same fucking music,
1210360	1213600	might I add, in pretty HD graphics.
1213600	1216680	And you're right, the sad thing is I think there's a part of me that doesn't care either,
1216680	1220320	I'll probably end up buying the damn game, despite all the drama that happened on this
1220320	1224900	program because of that game, I don't know, it is still somewhat addicting and I'm looking
1224900	1229440	forward to multiplayer, but I still kind of look at it with shifty eyes going, did you
1229440	1233680	have to reuse the same freaking song on the title screen?
1233680	1237060	And kind of the same gag over and over, I don't know, I'd like to see something a little
1237060	1240440	bit different, but I'm hoping some of the new modes will make me feel a little bit better
1240440	1241440	about things.
1241440	1242440	So, that was that.
1242440	1246760	Otherwise it was a three minute demo, can't really tell a lot off of that.
1246760	1249600	Darvoid says it better not be 60 bucks, Katamari.
1249600	1254040	No, it's like I think 30 or 40, it's like cheap.
1254040	1255040	That's good.
1255040	1259340	Nintendo Maniac 64 says, so Sky, is Bioshock the ochre enough time of first person shooters?
1259340	1264360	I don't, again, I don't want to base my entire opinion of a game off a demo, but it damn
1264360	1266040	well could be based off of the earlier reviews.
1266040	1269760	Oh great, time wasn't that great of a game anyways, and I still don't know what everyone's,
1269760	1273300	I still don't know what the hell everyone's big deal is with that game.
1273300	1277040	In the Zelda universe, the Super Nintendo, Link to the Past will always be the best one
1277040	1278040	to me.
1278040	1279040	Oh yeah.
1279040	1280040	Always be the best one.
1280040	1281040	Definitely.
1281040	1282040	Always.
1282040	1283040	Always, Jamie, always.
1283040	1286740	You sound like a maxi pet commercial, Rob.
1286740	1287740	I hate you.
1287740	1291560	All right, housekeeping, let's do some housekeeping tonight.
1291560	1295200	Okay, the only housekeeping we really have tonight is going to affect the live listeners.
1295200	1299240	We just found out literally five minutes before we went live tonight.
1299240	1303760	We found out five minutes before we went live, live 365 is shutting down at 8 p.m. tonight,
1303760	1307040	so that's going to screw some of you live listeners out of some of the perks of listening
1307040	1311680	live and we apologize, like the bonus segment we do in between and the afterbirth just because
1311680	1312680	of the maintenance.
1312680	1315400	We're going to try and cram all the show in before 8 p.m.
1315400	1318720	We're going to rearrange Skypline a little bit too and do it in the beginning of part
1318720	1322440	B tonight and not at the end of part B as we usually do, and we're going to cut out
1322440	1326640	a few segments as well, like the mailbag, just because we got one email this whole week,
1326640	1328560	so we're going to roll it over to next week.
1328560	1331800	Mailbag at orangehonorsradio.com, we'd love to hear from you, your comments on the story.
1331800	1333440	Do you think Bioshock is all that?
1333440	1337480	I want to hear from people that played the Bioshock demo and didn't like it.
1337480	1342520	Please speak up because I always love to hear devil's advocate perspectives, so mailbag
1342520	1343520	at orangehonorsradio.com.
1343520	1346800	In the language of the week, I want email in as Italian, even though I can't read Italian
1346800	1347800	for shit.
1347800	1350540	Just be quiet.
1350540	1352280	I can still read French.
1352280	1356280	Alright, so sorry you guys about the downtime tonight, there's nothing we can really do
1356280	1357280	about it.
1357280	1359100	We're going to try and finish the show before 8 p.m., but we'll see.
1359100	1365800	And I wanted to mention, though, podcast awards, they're over, you know, we got nominated,
1365800	1367760	didn't win, but that's okay.
1367760	1370440	Congratulations to a cheap-ass gamer cast.
1370440	1371640	Didn't we announce that last week?
1371640	1372640	I don't remember.
1372640	1373960	No, it wasn't over last week.
1373960	1374960	No, it wasn't over last week.
1374960	1376040	Well, thank you for remembering.
1376040	1377640	So congratulations to them.
1377640	1379920	At least it was another independent podcast award.
1379920	1380920	Absolutely.
1380920	1384120	And we've always said, if we can't win it ourselves, it's best another independent podcast
1384120	1385700	win it, and another one did.
1385700	1386700	So there you go.
1386700	1387700	Good job.
1387700	1391920	And they've had a lot of, like, success this year, too, and a lot of drama with the whole,
1391920	1392920	like, what, that lawsuit?
1392920	1394720	Or, no, no, I went on a lawsuit, a subpoena.
1394720	1396840	The subpoena against them and everything?
1396840	1398480	Try to get the Circuit City ad?
1398480	1399480	Foreign members.
1399480	1402400	It's been a fun year to be a CAG cast listener.
1402400	1403400	Yeah.
1403400	1404760	So, good job for those guys.
1404760	1406240	You know, they're actually up for two awards.
1406240	1408960	I'd like to see them win the other one they were nominated for, but they don't find out
1408960	1411840	about the other one until the actual award ceremony.
1411840	1415280	Well, if any of them are listening, let me just tell you this much.
1415280	1417560	And I think I can speak for Jamie on this.
1417560	1420000	The award show is kind of lame.
1420000	1421000	Yes it is.
1421000	1422240	It could have gotten better.
1422240	1424400	They do have good nibbly food.
1424400	1429640	And I was about, I would have to say, by a distance of a foot and a half, I level with
1429640	1434000	Adam Curry's butt.
1434000	1435000	I'm not joking.
1435000	1438600	And I couldn't really appreciate it properly because he doesn't really have a nice butt
1438600	1439600	and I had the flu.
1439600	1443160	Alright, please can we get into game chat now, because I do not want to turn this into
1443160	1445320	the Adam Curry's butt podcast.
1445320	1449760	But I will turn it into the Bioshock podcast because I'll be damned if the internet isn't
1449760	1453240	abuzz about the game this week, so I got a quick story on Bioshock.
1453240	1454960	You probably heard about this.
1454960	1459640	Some lucky sons of bitches got the game early thanks to Toys R Us, because Toys R Us was
1459640	1462760	leaking the game out early, and I think I know how this happened.
1462760	1467040	They usually put those games out in the glass cases and just don't sell them until the day,
1467040	1470600	like usually the regular clerks, like no, don't sell this until such and such day, but
1470600	1473840	they have some type of system where they turn the box around or something, but those games
1473840	1477840	will sit out there in the glass case for like a week and a half before people can buy them,
1477840	1482600	and apparently some Toys R Us has just made a big boo-boo and sold the game.
1482600	1484600	So tons of people are getting this game early.
1484600	1488720	It's not just Toys R Us, but people I know that do other podcasts that for some reason
1488720	1493280	get free games sent to them, even though we've never, no, I take that back, we've got a couple,
1493280	1494640	but we didn't get this one.
1494640	1495640	There's only one company that loves this.
1495640	1496640	Lots of Bioshock.
1496640	1500560	Lots of Bioshock copies floating around out there, and of course, tens of millions more
1500560	1502960	come Tuesday, so there you go.
1502960	1503960	Yeah.
1503960	1506080	DJ Dark Knight says, huge fine.
1506080	1507080	I don't know, what do you think, Logan?
1507080	1508800	Do you think Toys R Us would get a fine over this?
1508800	1509800	I don't think so.
1509800	1516040	What they'll do is, I don't think it's Toys R Us, like it's not chain-wide, it's just
1516040	1519200	I think it was one or two stores in Jersey that were doing it.
1519200	1520720	A couple sloppy managers.
1520720	1523280	And it's just, you know, it's some idiot, and what they'll do is they'll try to track
1523280	1528160	it down based on the receipts and stuff, and someone will get in trouble there, and that's
1528160	1529160	about it.
1529160	1534800	As long as it's not corporate-wide or something, it's not going to be a huge deal.
1534800	1538600	They may just get their next game or whatever shipped to them.
1538600	1540480	They won't get it before street date.
1540480	1544080	A little slap on the wrist, naughty, naughty.
1544080	1545080	No cookie.
1545080	1547920	Yeah, because there's, what, Target and shit.
1547920	1548920	Target and Walmart are horrible.
1548920	1552960	Toys R Us is usually the biggest offender when it comes to breaking street date.
1552960	1553960	Funny you guys say that.
1553960	1557920	Son of Dad says, for once it's not Target breaking massive street dates.
1557920	1561000	Joshi16 says, I would laugh if OLR got a free Madden.
1561000	1564400	Hey, you know what, please, send me one, because...
1564400	1567700	I would laugh if we did too, because EA's pretty...
1567700	1570200	Why not give it a fair shot and give the game a fair shot?
1570200	1572800	I'm not going to hold a grudge against it just because it's a sports game.
1572800	1574160	It deserves a fair shot just like any other game.
1574160	1575720	Hey, I'm not saying it's a horrible game either.
1575720	1578060	I'm just saying I don't care for sports games.
1578060	1579060	Any sports games.
1579060	1580060	Alright, anyway.
1580060	1581060	Moving on.
1581060	1585280	Anyways, so if you don't have your hands on Bioshock yet, you still can get your hands
1585280	1591000	on the art book, which is free to download from Irrational Games.
1591000	1595880	This was something that they were going to try to put into the limited edition pack that
1595880	1603200	was exclusive to EB and GameStop, but they just ran out of time, so instead they've offered
1603200	1608140	it for free to download on their website in PDF form, so check it out.
1608140	1612920	It's Bioshock Breaking the Mold, and it's over 60 pages long.
1612920	1613920	Cool.
1613920	1614920	Art books are great.
1614920	1619720	Now, speaking, though, of computery stuff, you know they were saying, well, at least
1619720	1626620	IGN PC reviewed PC Bioshock as much better than the Xbox 360 version, saying that it
1626620	1630360	handled better, the interface was better by using the mouse and the keyboard.
1630360	1633680	Which if you're playing a first person shooter, hi, duh!
1633680	1635060	Well now, wait a minute.
1635060	1636060	Except, except, except.
1636060	1637060	It's personal preferences, I think.
1637060	1638140	Here's the classic debate.
1638140	1640220	Keyboard and mouse versus analog sticks.
1640220	1642460	I mean, people, it's like...
1642460	1645080	Depending on how the game, though, is supposed to be played, the functionality of the game
1645080	1652080	self? Like, okay, what would you rather play Doom on? PC or?
1652440	1659440	Well, okay, I read their review on Bioshock and their thing was, they're saying, for example,
1659800	1665400	switching your special abilities using the right mouse button instead of the left bumper
1665400	1670780	on the 360. To be honest, I don't have trouble hitting the left bumper on the 360, it's not
1670780	1676600	hard, I just don't get it. It's just nitpicking shit, is what it is. And they're also saying
1676600	1679240	the hacking is a little bit easier because you can use the mouse instead of having to
1679240	1680080	use the analog stick.
1680080	1682400	Well, say it graphically.
1682400	1683640	Minor shit, that's all it is.
1683640	1687840	Well, they were also pointing out, though, that you could run it at a 1920 by 1200.
1687840	1689760	Well, I'm sure you can do it.
1689760	1690880	If you've got a PC, hi.
1690880	1694400	If you have an Uber computer that's fast enough to, I bet if I tried to run it at that resolution
1694400	1698520	it wouldn't be smooth. That's the other problem. I mean, but that's, you know, PC gaming in
1698520	1703140	general. You usually have to have the most top-end system to play most of the newer games.
1703140	1706360	Not all. Like, you know, games like World of Warcraft can run on pretty old machines,
1706360	1707400	but, you know.
1707400	1712680	But it's meant to be available to a high audience. You know, a broad range.
1712680	1717400	I'd try it out on PC. I don't know, though. I'm so used to those types of games now with
1717400	1722360	the analogs, I don't know. But yeah, like Quake 3, I couldn't not play that on a PC.
1722360	1726520	Like, you know, there's just some games you really get used to. And, you know, if we want
1726520	1728640	to go the other way around, Final Fantasy XI, okay?
1728640	1731000	Well, yeah, we did have that issue, didn't we?
1731000	1734280	Yeah, yeah. Final Fantasy XI was made for a console. It was made for the PlayStation
1734280	1739160	2, ported to the PC. I can't fucking play that game with a controller for shit. I have
1739160	1740760	to have the keyboard to play that game.
1740760	1745760	But I had absolutely no problem playing it with a controller. I started off with that
1745760	1751160	crappy little gravis pad I got for ten bucks from Dan's GameStop back in the day. And I
1751160	1755080	was doing all my macros and crap with my trigger buttons.
1755080	1756960	You know what? Your wiring is backwards, I think.
1756960	1759440	What?
1759440	1761960	The games you're supposed to play with a controller you like to play with keyboard and mouse.
1761960	1764400	The games you're supposed to play with keyboard and mouse you like with a controller. You're
1764400	1765400	backwards.
1765400	1766400	No, I'm not.
1766400	1767400	I'll ask you what it is. Yes, you are.
1767400	1768400	All right.
1768400	1770800	That and, you know, it's kind of hard to play Doom without a keyboard because of, you know,
1770800	1774200	IDDQD and IDBFG and all that.
1774200	1780760	All right. Let's see. Looking at chat room for comments. Chat.orangelanatrader.com. Sephiroth1215
1780760	1785960	says, FPS games are usually done in the USA and U.S. companies love to have the best graphics
1785960	1787920	possible and that's not possible on Wii.
1787920	1792400	Let's start a little debate there about I'm sure Metroid Prime 3 is coming into the mix
1792400	1795480	as well now because that game is out, what, next week as well or two weeks?
1795480	1796480	Two weeks.
1796480	1797480	Yeah.
1797480	1805560	Yeah. Let's see. What else is there here? I guess Dark Tetsuya maybe talked about that.
1805560	1810440	I wish they'd make Red Steel 2 even though they have so much room for improvement.
1810440	1813360	Lots of room for improvement.
1813360	1817440	Let's see. Yeah, rostielut says it probably costs three times as much to get a system
1817440	1820320	that will run Bioshock. Well, we'll see.
1820320	1825160	All right. Anyway, I'm talking also about the Xbox Live and the PC, you know, things
1825160	1832640	that are on both. Xbox Live Arcade is going to be on its way to the PC in November. The
1832640	1838700	secret project name was Vega, not, you know, Street Fighter's Vega but Vega the Star.
1838700	1843300	It's going to be launching in early November 10 to 20 games in the service and I believe
1843300	1846900	I saw an early screenshot that had like Galaga as one of the games and of course they want
1846900	1852140	to expand this with two to four new games every month following the launch.
1852140	1855780	So kind of not surprising when you consider the Microsoft's been trying to bridge the
1855780	1860360	gap between the console and the PC but I don't know. I don't know if I'd buy a lot of these
1860360	1864840	for PC but my question is if I bought it on Live, would I get to download it for free
1864840	1868320	on the PC? I think I should.
1868320	1870640	Of course I'm cheap.
1870640	1874060	The other thing too I'm wondering is it's going to be a little bit of a harder sell
1874060	1879680	to sell some of these PopCap games that are free online on the PC.
1879680	1884760	Yeah, but even PopCap like charges, you know, extra money for a downloadable version with
1884760	1888060	more features. That's where they make their money because whenever you play one of those
1888060	1892460	games online, they're always saying download the trial version of the Uber version of this
1892460	1897240	game with more levels and more colors, woo, and all that.
1897240	1900620	I think what's also interesting about the whole thing is that the 150 megabyte size
1900620	1904400	limit still applies even to the PC games. That's kind of interesting to me, I don't
1904400	1905400	know.
1905400	1913360	Well, I don't know. Anyways, maybe, well actually the 150 meg limit maybe that does tie into
1913360	1916440	something that they're going to be able to be transferred back and forth or something.
1916440	1919040	I don't know. I would hope so. Maybe later on or something.
1919040	1927600	Okay, so this is not a big surprise but apparently the news got out that Xbox or Microsoft is
1927600	1936840	just saying is allowing certain MMOs to require hard drive space and require the use of the
1936840	1942920	Xbox 360 hard drive. Duh, I mean Final Fantasy XI, hello, I mean. But apparently what they're
1942920	1948640	saying is that each title will create a master storage file, one file per title per console
1948640	1953760	or something like that. And apparently on the box it will say, you know, such and such
1953760	1955560	storage is required.
1955560	1958520	Even though XI didn't say that, did it? Well I guess it had to have said it somewhere.
1958520	1963160	It must have because you had to install it to your hard drive, so. I don't know, I'm
1963160	1968520	not surprised that MMOs require this. I'm just surprised that normal games haven't gotten
1968520	1972760	this yet. I still think that that is coming, whether they're saying it or not.
1972760	1977240	The most shocking thing about that story to me, I was like, there's MMOs in development
1977240	1982720	for the 360, awesome. Wasn't there that Marvel MMO or something that was coming out to them?
1982720	1986480	That would be awesome, I'll play that. I don't remember that. I'm like, what MMOs are in
1986480	1990760	development for 360? I'm just totally spacing it. I know I've heard of something, but I
1990760	1995760	just, I can't remember. Like what is in development for 360 as an MMO? Well, I don't know. People
1995760	2000080	go play Phantasy Star Universe. Oh my God, World of Warcraft, it must be true. World
2000080	2004000	of Warcraft is coming to 360. Oh, shut up. World of Warcraft is never coming to 360.
2004000	2008920	Leave it on the damn PC. Ragnarok 2. Now that would be sweet. Yeah, I've been trying to
2008920	2014800	get the, I have to have a Korean social security number apparently. Sucks. Well, no, there's
2014800	2018480	ways of getting around it, but I've been trying to play the Ragnarok 2 demo. Wow. You're gonna
2018480	2022920	have to kidnap a Korean child. There's other ways to do that, I don't want a Korean child.
2022920	2027640	Oh, DJ Dark Knight has a good point. Phantasy Star Universe is also another MMO on the 360.
2027640	2034440	That's what I just said. In fact, the add-on comes out this fall for it if people are still
2034440	2039040	playing that game. Guess who quit? Ah, that'd be me. I know. I don't know, so I... There's
2039040	2043520	Julie, she's fully addicted to PSU. There's a part of me that wants to go back to PSU,
2043520	2048000	but not until I hit 70 in WoW. I hit 64 yesterday, so I'm getting close. The part of me that
2048000	2055400	wants to go back to playing PSU has been sporked in the head and buried in a deep pit. PSU
2055400	2060800	wasn't that bad. I had fun with it. I'm glad you did. Thank you, Rob. But there's more
2060800	2068920	fun, better fun. Wait, hold on, I gotta say, Dark Tetsuya says, find at. Did you hear about
2068920	2072520	the baby this week? That's mine in Korea. Oh, that was China. That's China. Get your
2072520	2077400	countries right. Get your Asia right, Dark Tetsuya. God, really. That was still kind
2077400	2083800	of funny. A little funny, even if it was wrong, it was funny. I know. You know what, read
2083800	2090040	the news, people. Go on Yahoo, instead of reading about celebrities in the Paris Hilton
2090040	2094840	stupid ass, read World News. Well, what if I like to read about celebrities? Like, Perez
2094840	2099720	Hilton is like in my day. Like, I always say, okay, you gotta visit Kotaku and Destructoid
2099720	2106080	and Joystiq and Perez Hilton. That's basically how I, you know. Okay. I surf the net every
2106080	2113360	day. I go to Yahoo News, and then I go to CNN.com, and then I read my live journal.
2113360	2116800	No one cares about our browsing habits. Go to the next story. And then I go to Porno
2116800	2120420	too. While SteelUT apparently needs an explanation,
2120420	2124160	some people in China wanted to name their child At, because I think, what, they meet
2124160	2128440	by email or something? And At is pronounced like Achi or something.
2128440	2131560	I stopped caring five minutes ago. Which means love him or something. Why don't
2131560	2138640	they just use the actual, you know, symbols for that. Anyway, so whatever. How about something
2138640	2145080	that should excite some of our more emo people? My Chemical Romance is going to be in Guitar
2145080	2152720	Hero 3. They're doing a three pack, I'm sorry, not Guitar Hero 3, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360.
2152720	2161920	They are doing a three song pack for Xbox Live Marketplace that will have teenagers'
2161920	2169800	famous last words, and this is how I disappear. It is 500 points, AKA $6.25.
2169800	2172480	And I believe it's actually up now. They're master tracks, by the way, from the
2172480	2175800	band. And I believe we have a little clip of those
2175800	2182040	songs. So, cause, like, well, you know, cause, because, like, I have no idea who my, well,
2182040	2184040	I know who they are, but I don't really listen to these type of bands.
2184040	2186040	They did one song that I like. I don't.
2186040	2189480	That was Cemetery Drive. Like, I knew none of these songs.
2189480	2196480	Say something, Rob. Alright, let's do it.
2219480	2230000	The chat room is all, like, going, no, no, don't play that, why did you do that, why?
2230000	2234040	And Sephiroth1215, though, says, hey, I hate emo, but the Black Parade is very good.
2234040	2236720	I don't know, I thought the songs were kind of melodic.
2236720	2242000	They seem to fit in Guitar Hero 2. I mean, I don't get into the whole emo versus
2242000	2246880	punk versus whatever else, I don't know. At least you got some new fucking tracks
2246880	2249680	to download for Guitar Hero 2 that are not Guitar Hero 1.
2249680	2252560	Amen, there you go. Can't we all agree that that's a good thing,
2252560	2254640	even if you don't like the particular band they picked?
2254640	2257480	There you go. Good job.
2257480	2262800	Alright, well, speaking of Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 3 is going to be getting Slash.
2262800	2267320	You already knew about that, but they're also going to be having Bret Michaels, if you can
2267320	2270680	believe it. Bret Michaels is going to be using his face
2270680	2274160	and his image in the game, just like Slash, and then, of course, in the game, you gotta
2274160	2280940	get some Poison songs, Talk Dirty to Me by Poison, and go that far from the Bret Michaels
2280940	2283600	band. So, pretty cool, you can look forward to those
2283600	2286800	songs in Guitar Hero 3. Unfortunately, we do not have clips of those
2286800	2289800	songs because I was too lazy to pre-arrange that before the show.
2289800	2293440	Well, way to go, Rob. My bad.
2293440	2299360	Anyways, if you happen to be living in Australia, you'll be happy to know that the 360 core
2299360	2305880	has now been price-dropped to compete with the Wii, is now the same price as the Wii,
2305880	2315880	and of course, coinciding with that, the 20GB system has also been dropped down to $579.95
2315880	2325920	Australian, so that's pretty awesome as well. Well, I don't know, dropping the core system
2325920	2330360	down to where the Wii is, not good enough, I still think.
2330360	2335880	Well, I don't know, I think it's interesting precedent, I wonder if that's going to happen
2335880	2340360	over here eventually, where the 360 will get cut back enough, where it can compete with
2340360	2343000	the Wii like that, but I don't think it'll happen anytime soon.
2343000	2347920	I think it's also a matter of the markets themselves that want to make it competitive
2347920	2352120	for the market it's in. Or is it just that Nintendo kind of likes
2352120	2356160	to screw the people that aren't in Japan or the U.S. by charging more for their systems,
2356160	2361520	because you know, doesn't the DS and the Wii cost way more? I guess most systems cost way
2361520	2367640	more in Europe and Australia, Canada. Again, the other thing has to do with what
2367640	2371520	the general cost of living is and how it relates to that particular area.
2371520	2375960	I don't think it's actually a very fair comparison to compare American dollars to other currencies,
2375960	2380080	when it depends on exactly how the currency works within the area it's from.
2380080	2385640	I'll give you that. Because as far as I know, it's not spending
2385640	2391820	a whole bunch of money in Europe. But it still creates an interesting choice
2391820	2396720	when they are the same price in that currency, the Wii and the 360, it's kind of a different
2396720	2401680	competition that it is here in that regard. But at the same time, if you want to argue
2401680	2407040	it I guess, that you would need to still buy a memory card in order to be able to save
2407040	2413240	your games and stuff, versus the Wii, which has built-in memory, although it is extremely
2413240	2417360	limited. Yeah, and you can't really download a lot
2417360	2420480	of videos with that. I forgot to mention, I did hear some interesting
2420480	2422200	news actually. Oh really?
2422200	2427400	Well not surprising, but the 64 meg memory unit for the 360 is going away.
2427400	2429240	Really? Yeah.
2429240	2431160	Where'd you get that? From Microsoft.
2431160	2433040	Places? Oh, I see.
2433040	2435280	Okay. Alright, well there you go.
2435280	2439520	Alright, well moving on. Well, for anyone who has been keeping up with
2439520	2446800	Sega, there was a rumor going around that they were doing a viking game called Vikings
2446800	2454320	Battle of Asgard, and GameStop has actually stopped listing the PS3 and Xbox 360 version
2454320	2461960	of that on their forthcoming games, and it was to be released in February 2008, but Sega
2461960	2465960	is not saying anything about it. I mean, they could say something when it comes
2465960	2473160	up to the convention coming up, but other than that, they're nuh-uh.
2473160	2477480	No hairy vikings! No fjords.
2477480	2481320	Wasn't there an old school PC game called Vikings or something like that, or what was
2481320	2484920	something else? I think it was the lost vikings or something?
2484920	2487200	Yeah, the lost vikings. Was that what it was?
2487200	2488680	I don't think this is a remake of that. I think it also had a version of the Super
2488680	2490200	Nintendo, didn't it? I think it did.
2490200	2494480	Yeah. Alright, anyway, completely different note
2494480	2501280	on Xbox Live Arcade. Apparently, they are developing Crazy Frog Racer?
2501280	2505800	They're porting it, yeah. Is Crazy Frog Racer already out on PC or something?
2505800	2507640	It's in the UK. Oh my lord.
2507640	2512880	And it's crap. Crazy Frog is like one of those franchises that really needs to go away.
2512880	2518520	Well anyway, the folks, it's Graffiti is the company that's working on it, and the CEO
2518520	2523680	of Graffiti, Kenneth Hurley, actually said this at a recent announcement, quote, we are
2523680	2528100	excited to jump in on the Xbox 360 and introduce our title to the millions of gamers around
2528100	2531840	the world playing on the console. But maybe no one wants to play your damn game.
2531840	2536200	Everything about that? Oh god, the soundtrack alone is going to make
2536200	2540880	me want to put a gun in my head. I don't get that Crazy Frog thing at all.
2540880	2545400	Have you heard the Crazy Frog songs, Jamie? I don't know.
2545400	2549240	Please have a clip. I will get a clip. I will load a clip right
2549240	2550760	now. Where's the ferret so I can do it it wrong?
2550760	2553680	While you do the next story. Do the next story and I will get a clip.
2553680	2559760	Alright, well, you may be waiting for a beautiful Katamari to come out in October, but in the
2559760	2566320	meantime though, you do have that wonderful demo that's available from Xbox Live.
2566320	2571200	And in case you want to get a little bit more life out of your demo, or just do something
2571200	2578360	really neat, what you need to do is hold the back and start buttons on your controller
2578360	2584480	as the demo is booting up on the main screen. And it will allow you to play as either the
2584480	2590540	Prince or Mag, one of Prince's many cousins. So you can actually play as one of the cousins
2590540	2593800	in the demo as well. Yay, that's kind of neat.
2593800	2597720	Yeah, and we actually have a clip of one of the new songs from Beautiful Katamari right
2597720	2617680	here. You know, if my Xbox, that was Crazy Frog
2617680	2622160	by the way, if my Xbox started making those type of noises, three red rings of death wouldn't
2622160	2627920	be enough for what I would do to it. Well, you know what, let's cleanse the palette
2627920	2635320	a little bit away from Retarded Frog. Smack you the frog. Anyway, for people who are still
2635320	2640440	playing Lost Planets, guess what? The maps are all free. You can just go get them.
2640440	2648440	I like free. They're free.
2648440	2653520	What else is there to say? Free stuff. Go Kat! Yay, free.
2653520	2657760	I like that whole concept though of releasing map packs in advance for money for the hardcore
2657760	2661680	people and then free for the rest of us later. Apparently, according to this, you can trade
2661680	2666240	in your game and rebuy it for 10 bucks at Toys R Us.
2666240	2670620	What? Because what this says, it says you can rebuy
2670620	2673240	it at Toys R Us for $9.99. Wow.
2673240	2677440	Why the fuck would you trade in your game and then rebuy it for 10 bucks?
2677440	2680240	It's a profit-making thing, I think. I think they're saying you can sell it back for more
2680240	2683680	and then buy it for cheap. It's a money-making scheme.
2683680	2687800	Whatever. I think that's with Madden. What it is is
2687800	2692520	the game is like 20 bucks right now. Let's see. Joshi16 says Crazy Frog Frogger
2692520	2696040	would be good. Kill him. They actually have Crazy Frog Racing coming
2696040	2700560	out on PlayStation 2 in two weeks, actually. Kill me now.
2700560	2722640	Maybe it'll coincide with the Xbox 360 game. Have you ever heard shittier music in your
2722640	2726000	life? I mean, really? Doesn't this make you want to go and willingly
2726000	2729560	listen to Britney Spears? It makes me want to go on a car trip with
2729560	2730560	you. Sorry.
2730560	2736960	Off a cliff? Hey, I've heard some of the stuff you play
2736960	2740680	in your car. I disagree with some of it.
2740680	2741680	Rob. What?
2741680	2746640	Heart. No, anyway. Let's change the subject. Our chat room's
2746640	2750560	in pain, and I'm sure many of you are, too. Let's talk about release dates. That's always
2750560	2754920	a happy subject that will wake us back up and get us all happy again.
2754920	2757280	Let's go over to Japan first and look at some release dates.
2757280	2761040	You might remember last week we didn't have a whole lot to report for the Japanese release
2761040	2763360	date. I hate to tell you, this week's looking pretty
2763360	2765720	similar. There is a new title on the Nintendo Wii coming
2765720	2773720	out on the 23rd from Compile, and it's called Sharui Takoran, which looks to be some type
2773720	2781720	of game where, I don't know. It's by Compile Heart, and this anime-looking
2781720	2784920	chick is offering up these little octopus-looking cute things.
2784920	2787760	I don't really know how else to describe it. It's a puzzle game, though.
2787760	2791720	Tentacle rape? Eh? No, no tentacle rape in this puzzle game.
2791720	2794080	No, that's what she's offering up. Tentacle rape, eh?
2794080	2797280	I don't think she's offering tentacle rape, Loki.
2797280	2802600	Also coming out on the PlayStation 2, Peer X Cure Recovery is coming out, and there's
2802600	2808760	also a special set coming out at the same time, and also coming out, Quiz and Variety
2808760	2815080	Suku Suku in Fuku 2. Moto Suku Suku is coming out.
2815080	2820400	That's what it's called. Okay, are there girls in school uniforms there?
2820400	2824760	Now check out this screenshot from Peer X Cure, Loki.
2824760	2835600	It looks like she wants a suku suku in the uku.
2835600	2839520	She's showing a little bit of skirt there, hiking up a little bit.
2839520	2842000	Okay, fuck Peer X Cure. I don't care about that.
2842000	2844840	I want to see what this suku suku thing is here.
2844840	2849480	It's a quiz game, though. Quiz and Variety.
2849480	2853220	I guess it's these cute little chibi bunny things.
2853220	2856080	Some are dressed as a knight, and some are dressed as little farms guys.
2856080	2859240	I guess that's Suku, and that's Fuku. I don't know.
2859240	2863560	Awesome. They're more descriptive terms, because moto
2863560	2867960	still is more. Alright, also coming out on the Nintendo DS.
2867960	2872560	Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fates, and I'm sure a lot of you guys like your Crystal
2872560	2875280	Chronicles, so there you go. You have that to look forward to, and that's
2875280	2879600	probably the biggest game this week. That and suku suku.
2879600	2883160	Awesome. Anyways, let's see.
2883160	2887800	In the US, there's some pretty good stuff to look forward to this week.
2887800	2894320	Just a little game called Bioshock on PlayStation 2, or not PlayStation 2, 360 and PC.
2894320	2897800	I meant PC for some reason I was looking at a PlayStation 2 game.
2897800	2899880	OMG, Bioshock's coming to PlayStation 3 after all.
2899880	2901920	OMG, OMG. OMG, no.
2901920	2905040	It is not coming to PlayStation 2. PlayStation 2 would melt down if they had
2905040	2909320	to play that game. On PlayStation 2, though, you can look forward
2909320	2915320	to two wonderful games, including Metropolis Mania 2 and Brunswick Bowling.
2915320	2921440	Awesome, hooray. On PS3 and PSP, you're going to be getting
2921440	2926880	Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, the delayed edition.
2926880	2933880	Then, let's see, also, let's see here, on PC and 360 as well, another good RPG, Two
2935280	2941280	Worlds coming out on both platforms, as well as the Two Worlds Collector's Edition.
2941280	2948280	And, let's see, on PSP, a couple more games, Jean de Arc and Dragonears Aria is also making
2952560	2955880	its way out. Then, let's see, on the Wii, a whole bunch
2955880	2962880	of nothing, and of course, on the DS, Brain Age 2, more brain training in minutes a day.
2965840	2969880	Another game that you'll play for one whole day and then stop playing.
2969880	2976160	And this one was really interesting, The Settlers is coming out on DS as well, which isn't that
2976160	2980280	Settlers of Catan, I think? The Settlers? Sounds familiar.
2980280	2985640	I don't know, I'll be able to look at that. And then, Operation Vietnam, so you too can
2985640	2988960	have the flashbacks that everybody is jealous of.
2988960	2993240	All right, that's government money out of. Real quick, before you get to the Europe dates,
2993240	2998980	I just want to say in chat, Darvoid says that Suku Fuku translates to summer uniform, despite
2998980	3002200	what you were thinking, sicko. That does look like a summer uniform.
3002200	3008640	Summer is natsu. Well, whatever, let's just move on.
3008640	3015640	On the 21st, we have Dragonears Aria on PSP. On the 24th, we have Anno 1701 for DS, Blue
3016600	3023600	Dragon on Xbox 360, Glory Days 2, Brotherhood of Men on DS, we have Loki on PC, a bunch
3023600	3029600	of Madden, fuck Madden, MotoGP 07. What's your biggest issue with Madden?
3029600	3033520	Sucks. I never said, I never, it's the husband and
3033520	3035960	friends thing. No, I detest American football.
3035960	3037760	All right, moving on. It's stupid.
3037760	3039560	I'm not going to argue. Play rugby!
3039560	3042320	Is Loki coming to Mac? No, it's PC.
3042320	3047480	That's right, and Loki does not come to Mac. I knew that was coming.
3047480	3049680	You're funny tonight. Can I continue?
3049680	3054160	Yes, you may. Thank you, sir. On the 24th, we have Pac-Man
3054160	3058800	Rally. 24th also is Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced
3058800	3063800	Warfighter 2 for PS3 and PSP, and 24th is Bioshock.
3063800	3068360	No, Bioshock. Are you going to hate that, too?
3068360	3075360	No, if they did a PS2 version, you'd think it would be like Bio Fizz, Bio Zap.
3075360	3081280	All right. I hope Mr. Bubbles gets a spinoff game. That's all I hope for.
3081280	3084200	He should have his own Saturday morning cartoonish show.
3084200	3088960	Mr. Bubbles Happy Hour! There should be a fighting game, Mr. Bubbles
3088960	3091640	vs. Pyramid Head. Pyramid Head would win.
3091640	3097760	That would be hardcore. They need to do scary games of the fire.
3097760	3104160	In a fight, though, between Mr. Bubbles, the Big Daddy and Pyramid Head, Mr. Bubbles, Pyramid
3104160	3108960	Head, and the licker from Resident Evil. I'm sorry. I would say, though, I think that,
3108960	3113920	you know, seeing in the demo how fast those, you know, Big Daddies move, and Pyramid Head's
3113920	3116200	just dragging that shit along. I mean, he's kind of slow.
3116200	3121040	Yes, but the only way you can kill Pyramid Head is for him to kill himself.
3121040	3122240	It's true. All right.
3122240	3125680	You have to beat him until he falls on his spike because he gets so tired of chasing
3125680	3128040	your stupid butt around. Seriously, what the hell happened to this
3128040	3129440	show tonight? We're random.
3129440	3132400	All right, anyway. But I do issue a challenge to anyone who's
3132400	3136240	working on our Moogan for us. Put Pyramid Head in there for me, please.
3136240	3143560	And label him P. Hiddy. I forgot about the Moogan thing.
3143560	3147880	It's P. Hiddy. Well, it was O.L.R. vs. A.G.I., right?
3147880	3152200	So it'd be, like, you, me, and Loki are all playable characters, and Scott, Mary Young,
3152200	3155360	and Jessica are all playable characters. Then maybe, like, Bobby B. for good measure,
3155360	3159360	and we could put one of our people, like Travis Donovan or D.M.N. or somebody can be a playable
3159360	3160480	character. And then P. Hiddy.
3160480	3168640	It just shows up. Random boss. He'd be like Noob Saibot.
3168640	3173320	It'd be smoke. All right.
3173320	3175760	Moving on. I'm looking at it.
3175760	3181640	Chat room is very random here. GS68 says, I want Dark Sakura the game, which
3181640	3187640	would more or less be Burnout O.L.R. edition. You don't know how right you are.
3187640	3191080	You just totally see her driving down the freeway. Let's see what else is there.
3191080	3196760	Joshi16 says, Bioshock on the Atari 2600. That'll be interesting.
3196760	3200520	All right. Anyhow, how about Wipeout on the Playstation 3?
3200520	3203780	A lot of folks want to see this game, and you might get to see it a little sooner than
3203780	3206220	later. You might, might, might, might get to see
3206220	3211840	it at Leipzig. A demo for the Sony Playstation Network release
3211840	3218160	of Wipeout HD apparently has been rated by the UK's version, I'm sorry, Germany's version
3218160	3222240	of the ESRB, and supposedly it's going to be at Leipzig Game Convention.
3222240	3224600	It was already formally announced. We know the game is coming.
3224600	3228960	It was already said that it was coming at E3 2007, and it's supposed to be released
3228960	3233920	before the end of the year. Wipeout HD, of course, will have high def.
3233920	3236160	It's Wipeout for the Playstation 3. What else do you need to know?
3236160	3240160	Why can't they just release a demo on the Playstation Network since there's hard landing
3240160	3245480	demos on there in the first place? Because people are really critical of demos
3245480	3248600	and stuff, and they probably want to make sure that, you know, because even though I
3248600	3251820	said earlier I wasn't going to base my full opinion of a game off a demo, there's a lot
3251820	3257080	of people that will, and I'm not perfect either. I've done it before, so.
3257080	3261120	So there you go. Another interesting thing, apparently Calling
3261120	3268400	All Cars is going to be transferable to the PSP, at least that's the rumor.
3268400	3277760	This is coming from a European magazine, PSP, the official guidebook, and no word on if
3277760	3283840	that's even true or not, but it would be interesting. I don't know.
3283840	3291680	Maybe sell some more copies on PSP that way. I don't know, is anyone interested in this
3291680	3293880	game? I know I looked at it and I was like, eh.
3293880	3298800	I have no idea what you're talking about. I've been ignoring it.
3298800	3306800	Alrighty then. I mean, is it supposed to be exciting?
3306800	3310520	Well, the game itself, you know, basically is kind of a cops and robbers type thing.
3310520	3313320	It's all done in, you know, cartoony cel-shaded and stuff.
3313320	3316880	Yeah, wasn't that, wasn't actually that an old show?
3316880	3319400	No. Oh, that was Car 54, Where Are You?
3319400	3320480	Yeah. That was a cool show.
3320480	3324080	I think there was a show called Calling All Cars, but I think it has nothing to do with
3324080	3330200	this, actually. I hear about the game and then it just goes
3330200	3332840	out of my head. I like the fact that it's transferable.
3332840	3336080	That's kind of a neat feature. I mean, that's something that Xbox Live is
3336080	3339640	never going to be able to really deliver because there is no portable Microsoft system yet,
3339640	3341840	but that's kind of neat. Wait.
3341840	3345680	I know, wait. Well, for anybody else, though, who's interested
3345680	3352560	in anything Sony has going on, there are going to be, they've actually got some dates released
3352560	3358000	from 3Speech for UK. First coming out is Warhawk on the 28th of
3358000	3367120	August on PSN and 21st September release for Blu-ray.
3367120	3378120	And also it's going to cost 19.99 pounds at 29 euros.
3378120	3385600	It will be, let's see, there will be extra video content, a manual and a Bluetooth headset
3385600	3391760	if you pay the 39.99 pounds to get it on the Blu-ray hard copy.
3391760	3398160	Heavenly Sword is going to be rumored as the 14th of September with Folklore and Lair on
3398160	3408200	12th and 26th October, of course, respective. And that's nothing really yet said about SingStar
3408200	3411640	for PS3. Will you guys be getting Lair at your house,
3411640	3414340	Jamie? Because I really want to see that game.
3414340	3418000	We could get it. I mean, we can rent whatever we want to.
3418000	3420000	Oh, that's cool. Because I'm kind of, you know, I still haven't
3420000	3423200	bought a PlayStation 3, but there are certain games I really would like to see that, you
3423200	3427240	know, may change my opinion on PlayStation 3 and finally get one, and that's one of them.
3427240	3429480	I can't remember if I have Lair on order or not.
3429480	3432400	I think I'm getting, I know I'm getting Heavenly Sword.
3432400	3436400	Oh yeah, that too. And then Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of
3436400	3438820	Destruction. I think by Christmas I'll have finally caved
3438820	3442680	and buy a PlayStation 3, I think. We'll see.
3442680	3444920	The longer you wait, the better a deal you're going to get.
3444920	3447580	That's true. So I'm trying to hold out, and I, well, also
3447580	3450080	the fact that I just don't have a lot of money right now, so.
3450080	3453840	And just remember, all the good games you're looking forward to aren't coming out until
3453840	3456440	next spring at least. True. True.
3456440	3462320	Anyways, I'll hold up. Well, moving on, let's talk about free, because,
3462320	3466440	you know, if I can't buy new consoles, then I'm going to get free stuff, because I like
3466440	3470680	free stuff. One thing that's now free is Ark Lord.
3470680	3475400	If you are an MMO fan, hopefully you've heard of this game, but if you haven't, Codemasters
3475400	3481440	Online Gaming has made its online RPG, Ark Lord, completely free to play.
3481440	3484680	There's an all-new expansion also available for download.
3484680	3489440	The director of marketing at COG noted, quote, Since its release, Ark Lord has grown consistently
3489440	3493160	and we are excited to throw open the doors to players across North America and Europe
3493160	3499720	looking to play a premium, 100% free MMORPG. There's got to be a catch.
3499720	3502440	What's the catch? There must be a catch.
3502440	3507800	Is there ads or something? It says, I'm looking at the official website
3507800	3513520	here, zero fees, download the free game now. I might check it out just for shits and giggles.
3513520	3517760	I thought that was, someone said that Overlord was based off that game, and I don't think
3517760	3521560	so, but possibly. The name sounds familiar, or similar, I should
3521560	3524040	say. Similarish name.
3524040	3527520	Rasteel UT says, Next week, Ark Lord closes down.
3527520	3534320	Enjoy it while it lasts. Well, speaking of enjoying it while it lasts,
3534320	3542320	you may be familiar with a wonderful spin-off into the porno world called World of Warcraft.
3542320	3547960	Well, guess what? They've decided to move off of World of Warcraft and move into the
3547960	3554560	ever-expanding realm of first person shooters. Yes, they have just created FPS porn.
3554560	3561680	Operation Sex, Cock and Load. That is the actual fucking name of this thing.
3561680	3568600	It is a gaming-themed porn series that is, of course, based off of games like Counter-Strike,
3568600	3573840	Ghost Recon, and Rainbow Six, and involves a lot of people running around shooting fake
3573840	3581400	guns and yelling stuff and sex. That's the best combination ever.
3581400	3585000	That's a list list in the making we need to do next week.
3585000	3588720	Random things you should have in a porn game. No, what video game should be turned into
3588720	3592680	porn? Like Biocock. Could be maybe an FPS that comes
3592680	3594960	out in the future. Cocking Mama.
3594960	3601520	Cocking Mama? What the hell is wrong with you?
3601520	3609480	Mama will fix it, naughty boy. Okay, I didn't say that.
3609480	3613160	Attention internet, DarkSakura would like to see Cocking Mama.
3613160	3620320	No! Not me. I was just thinking of names.
3620320	3626320	Looking at comments in the chat room, NintendoManiac64 says FPS, first person sex.
3626320	3631140	No, it's not first person sex, because that's POV sex, by the way.
3631140	3634680	That's a whole different genre. Just stop.
3634680	3638720	This is actually first person, where they've got the gun and everything, and they're firing
3638720	3642800	the gun and reloading it just like you would see in a first person shooter game, except
3642800	3646960	they stop and have sex every now and then. Because when you're in the middle of terrorist
3646960	3654080	warfare, you have to stop and have sex. They have to reload.
3654080	3660520	This is so mature tonight. RasteelUT sticks his head in a meat grinder.
3660520	3663640	Yay, good job. You've got the guy who's always ragging on
3663640	3668920	us, put his head in the meat grinder. No, I'm just kidding.
3668920	3676080	joshi16 says train your cock in minutes a day. RasteelUT says cooking mama bobbit.
3676080	3684360	Footy in Toronto says Nintendcats in itself is a sex game. Nintendpussy.
3684360	3691820	We are so mature. This show has sunk to the level of dick and
3691820	3694920	fart jokes. Congratulations, everybody.
3694920	3700080	You ever remember X-Man and Custer's Revenge? Of course I remember Custer's Revenge.
3700080	3702600	I haven't played X-Man, but I've heard you talk about it.
3702600	3704600	Got it. Good times.
3704600	3709160	All right, let's take a break. That sounds like a good idea, Rob.
3709160	3711280	This show's getting a little crazy. We're going to take a quick break.
3711280	3714640	We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
