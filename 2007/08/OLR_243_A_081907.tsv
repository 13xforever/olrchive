14085	24512	Tonight, August 19th, 2007, the Wii and the 360 are the same price in one country, Guitar Hero 3 gets a little poison, and is a Wii Mode coming to the PlayStation 2?
32153	36537	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36557	42762	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42802	47986	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to my lovely co-host, DarkSakura.
48366	48887	Hi.
49147	50528	How are you doing, Miss Jamie Summers?
50768	51188	I'm here.
51569	51949	You're here?
52289	53110	You're alive and well?
53450	54131	Yes, quite.
54491	55432	All is good in the hood?
55612	56353	And not hungover.
56613	56793	Yes.
57393	61036	I got to watch DarkSakura get drunk last night.
61056	61697	I'll drink everybody.
62461	63321	and No Hangover.
63561	64042	No Hangover.
64162	64662	Amazing.
65702	66563	Do you remember what you drank?
66663	67463	Can you run down real quick?
67623	68904	Yes, I can.
69404	70965	I had a shot of cold sake.
71125	73886	I had 28 ounces of Kirin beer.
74786	83950	I had six martinis, two of them being palm tinis, one key lime pie and Adam and Eve because it was very tasty.
83990	84410	It was apple.
84930	85351	I had...
86772	89054	A guavatini, I had, what was that?
89155	90356	Oh God, I can't remember the first one.
90516	91317	The chocolate martini.
91878	96744	And then I had a shot of Glenlivet scotch.
98112	100254	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
122873	123253	Hello!
123453	124714	Who did not join us last night.
124794	125375	No, I did not.
125435	126216	Alright, that's alright.
126636	131319	You weren't invited, because it was a bachelorette party, so straight men don't get to go to bachelorette parties, unfortunately.
131619	132440	Rob went to mine.
132500	135162	But he's not a straight man.
135222	135883	Yeah, exactly.
136083	137744	I know, I was saying you went to mine.
137804	138404	I invited you.
138845	144389	By the way, my boyfriend got very, very drunk last night, and Jamie definitely outdrank him.
144429	145410	I'm like next to nothing.
145450	145670	Anyway...
146270	146830	Nobody cares.
146850	148111	They want to hear the video game chat.
148411	149692	Loki, what did you do last night?
149732	150952	Maybe it was something gaming related.
152713	153073	No.
153733	157795	Instead, I went and saw the movie Superbad, and it was awesome.
158476	158936	Was it good?
158956	159396	I don't know.
159536	159936	I loved it.
159996	163438	I haven't seen, like, I think I saw, like, three-fourths of The 40-Year-Old Virgin.
163458	165619	I just never finished it, and then I didn't see that knocked up.
165639	166739	I wouldn't even compare it to it.
166859	167980	It's not even anything like that.
168020	168520	It's more like...
169301	170642	American Pie, but less retarded.
171243	173865	If you've ever seen Knocked Up... We should put that on the poster.
174105	175466	It's American Pie, but less retarded.
175606	178468	Well, if you've seen Knocked Up, it kind of has that same vibe to it.
178508	189417	I mean, there's a lot of crude jokes and stuff like that, but it's still very... You don't go into it like... There's no real gross-out moments or anything like that.
189937	190718	It's just kind of...
191405	192486	You can relate to it, I guess.
192506	194427	This is like freshman year type American Pie?
219932	222514	Jaded says no, we don't want to hear the video game chat.
222534	223535	We want to hear the drunken people chat.
249147	249667	Well, I don't know.
249747	254349	Some of our podcast subscribers might disagree with you, so we will get to game chat very soon.
254429	261592	But, you know, I mean, you can read about the news pretty much anywhere on the Internet, but we like to put our personal touch on things and hear from you guys.
261932	264393	That's why we always invite you guys to chat.orangelongeradio.com.
265193	268654	RossDLUT says, crude jokes does not equal good comedy.
269614	271935	And Sephiroth1215 says, Superbad was okay.
271975	272836	I was laughing the whole time.
273616	273896	There you go.
274588	288375	And especially, you know, there's a whole... I don't want to ruin it, but there's a part where you find out that one of the characters had a really bad habit when he was growing up, and it had to do with doodling things, and...
289042	295424	That part, it's super funny when they show it, and after the credits, there's more of that stuff, and it's hilarious.
295444	296845	Okay, I'll take your word for it.
297105	303067	Now, okay, so to bring things back to video games, and we transition to How Was Your Gaming Week, could there be a super bad video game?
303167	305928	Because, you know, as movies do very good, sometimes they get turned into video games.
305948	306308	I hope not.
307085	309447	There's a Napoleon Dynamite game coming out.
309867	315111	I was just thinking, I was like, you know, speaking of things that jumped the shark, I'm really surprised there's not a Napoleon Dynamite game.
315131	315712	No, there is.
315972	316312	Really?
316873	319474	DS and PSP, it looks stupid.
320195	320755	Horrible.
321136	321716	Sweet.
322777	325799	It's like, I mean, it's not even coming out remotely.
325859	328681	It's not like an anniversary of that movie or anything like that.
328742	335887	It's just, oh, by the way, we decided, you know, let's make a movie for this or a game for this that's, you know, years after the movie.
336748	338389	If there's one thing... Gosh.
339810	344674	If there's one thing I really hate, it is video games based on shitty movies that shouldn't be turned into video games.
344694	346075	They should do Xanadu, the game.
346335	347836	Now, that might be okay, actually.
347936	349537	It has to be all animated by Don Bluth.
349757	353500	Because sometimes when movies are so bad, they're kind of good.
353580	355461	Like, Showgirls, the game, I'd buy that.
355501	358803	There's a Betty Boop game coming out in fucking October.
359003	361265	It's like, come on!
361785	364247	Seriously, you missed the boat a long time ago with that.
364287	365028	Aren't we past the 1930s, Hive?
366578	368019	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
368039	369280	I beat the first area, the first town.
395751	396491	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
418504	419504	Yeah, I'll give you that.
419664	419984	I don't know.
420104	424386	I still have a soft spot for four, but I think that's just because that was my first one.
424586	425746	Yes, and you spoonied Bard.
426006	426246	But anyway.
426266	427846	But, but, but, but, but, but, but.
428447	429387	I touched it today.
430867	431107	What?
431167	431987	Final Fantasy VI?
432187	432348	No.
432588	432788	What?
433068	433688	Super Metroid.
434428	434568	Ah.
434608	440029	I picked up my Super Nintendo today and was going to pack it up and bring it over here, and then Dan informed me, oh, we're lending that to Adam.
440630	444230	Thank God you got it as a second guess, because the third guess wasn't much better for me.
444311	444511	Hey!
447872	449834	For the record, I do own Kirby's Avalanche.
451575	451915	So there.
452856	453156	All right.
453756	457619	And I was just saying, Super Metroid comes out on Virtual Console next week, but you were like, shh.
457939	458300	No.
458320	460661	That was exactly the noise you made when I said it was coming out on Virtual Console.
460701	461162	You were like, shh.
462162	462362	No.
462382	463143	We're playing the real one.
463163	464504	Even though the emulation on Wii is pretty good.
464584	465525	We're playing the real one.
465545	466565	We're going to play the real one.
466826	467646	Jamie and I failed.
467686	470188	Either that, or I have to see if my HoriPad will work.
470608	473650	We failed to have our Super Metroid night, but we are going to have it soon.
474151	474331	We've...
475003	475863	Go to your local flea market and pay $5
500091	502012	I'm just going to chat and reading some stuff here.
502612	504833	Son of Dad is talking about movie-based games.
505133	506754	Remember the Nacho Libre game?
506974	507014	No.
507114	507974	Yes, unfortunately I did.
507994	508794	Thankfully I don't.
509034	510035	I don't think I played that.
510055	510875	That was on the DS.
511195	513916	Well, there's, like, what other crap's coming up?
514096	522860	Arctic Tail, which, for those who may not know, Arctic Tail is going to be a brand new movie, kind of like March of the Penguins, except with polar bears and, like, seals.
522960	525021	Or what was the other one they had?
525561	526061	Happy Feet.
526481	527462	Happy Feet sucked.
527862	528202	Yeah.
529201	532464	The movie was okay, but at least Happy Feet was not a documentary, though.
532664	540430	It was, you know, there was singing and dancing in there, so you can kind of, you know, turn that into a pretty good game, I guess.
540790	543432	TigerClaw says, Sky, what about the Alvin and Chipmunk games?
543492	544973	It's going to be kind of like Guitar Hero.
545553	550297	Yeah, but Alvin and Chipmunk, so that's another movie tie-in game for, you know, it's going to be crap.
550397	555221	Here's the thing, like, the new Alvin and the Chipmunks makes me want to throw up in my mouth, okay?
555301	558103	Like, when I saw the poster and everything, it looks like crap.
558623	562227	and I just never liked the original to begin with, to be honest.
562247	565030	That's not one thing from my childhood I fondly remember.
565050	566452	I think they were kind of stupid.
566492	568735	Jason Lee is such a sellout now.
568795	572378	Seriously, what the fuck happened since the VSQ days?
572539	573500	I liked My Name is Earl.
574359	579621	Okay, I don't like that show, but credit to that at least, that's a little different.
579901	586222	But come on, I mean, seriously, the Alvin Chipmunk shit, I mean... Alright, now we're getting back into movie podcasting.
586262	587603	Let's get back to the games.
588003	588943	Was there anything else you wanted to share?
588963	594805	My name is Earl of the TV show, and the only reason I saw that is because you were there, they were watching it at my Fourth of July party.
595565	602807	The only game that I think this year that's going to be any good that's tied in with sort of a movie, and it's not even really based on a movie, The Simpsons game.
603601	605062	is going to be fucking awesome.
605582	606082	That is it.
624918	628039	I prefer playing the actual game on the actual, that's just how I've always been.
628379	630480	But there is a good point to emulation.
631060	633180	Translated Japanese RPGs.
633540	634801	Seiken Densetsu 3.
635361	637141	The quintessential translated game you must play.
637181	640222	Where they went and translated the graphics in the game.
640682	643923	Or Final Fantasy V before Square brought it over here.
643963	644903	That was the other biggie.
645043	650385	I had a very, very well translated, or even, I had a translated Panorama Cotton once.
650645	650765	Hmm.
651417	652759	And the Ninja Pass!
670957	673998	All right, anything else you want to share for your gaming week?
674118	674298	No.
674518	675878	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
676358	677919	I tried to play as much as possible.
678239	683100	I played Casserone a little bit, the demo for that, and it's pretty interesting, actually.
683700	691162	I could kind of get into it, you know, because I know Nelly's been hooked on Catan, and I had to literally drag the 360 to a different room.
691702	693563	So that I could actually play some games on it.
694243	695223	So that was pretty cool.
695663	700585	And then, of course, the one demo everyone's been playing this week would be Bioshock.
700645	702285	And I tried that, and it's awesome.
702645	705446	So awesome that I decided to pre-order my game after I played it.
706786	708967	And then, let's see here.
709167	712428	Also played some more Beautiful Katamari.
713148	713989	All three minutes of it.
714729	715129	And then...
717437	720258	I played Overlord some more, and that's actually been pretty fun.
720338	721718	I was pretty surprised.
721738	729460	I thought I'd get tired of the game pretty quick and kind of hesitated to purchase it originally, but I'm actually very satisfied with the game.
729520	733761	It's pretty fun, and it's really the game itself.
734281	744624	You try to be good in it, and I think it's harder to be good in the game than evil, but after a while, the NPCs just really piss you off, and you just go and decide to kill everybody, and that's the way you should do it, I think.
746032	755477	Other than that, I played me and my Katamari on the PSP and tried to remind myself why I hated it on the PSP in the first place, and that would be the controls.
755897	758679	They suck balls without having a second analog stick on there.
761200	768684	And then, of course, Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, because for some reason we're a glutton for punishment with that game.
768844	768984	It's
771237	778003	I don't know how this is fucking possible, but the game actually glitches in new ways.
778503	781926	It just progressively evolves into a worse game.
782366	783247	And I don't know why.
783407	784888	It's just weird.
785209	788992	It's like a guy's own conscience or something.
789052	792555	It just fucking gets worse, and I don't know how.
793115	793696	But it does.
794416	798680	And yet we'll still play it until they release another fucking Grand Theft Auto game that has multiplayer.
802060	802961	I think that's all I played.
805282	806403	Oh, I played Track and Field.
806703	807083	Hated it.
807844	808304	You didn't like it?
808544	809364	No, didn't care for it.
809385	810505	For me, it's dumb fun.
810645	813987	I mean, it's totally a brainless type of game, Track and Field.
814488	819471	I still haven't bought the full retail one, but I've played the old school one on the computer.
819511	821492	I know it was in the arcade at one time.
821512	822092	Yeah, it was.
822452	823833	I remember playing an arcade one a long time ago.
823853	826695	They should remake it into the arcade with a DDR pad type thing.
826755	828096	I think that would be a little bit more...
828721	856030	put it in like sports bars or something Konami has both yeah uh my gaming week um you know not a lot of new stuff to try out this week you know obviously there's Madden but sports games are typically not my cup of tea so I passed on that um so just kind of playing the old stuff World of Warcraft, Boom Boom Rocket oh yeah I played that too what Boom Boom Rocket or World of Warcraft how'd that go for you you were here oh yeah that's right der anyway um let's see what else I play um
858224	865767	Echo the Dolphin, I downloaded and tried out on Xbox Live, and I have to admit, I thought the game was overrated when I first played it.
866047	867448	Many years ago, I think it's overrated now.
867488	868728	I'm not a fan of the Echo series.
869869	871929	I never understood why people love that so much.
872189	873210	You're breaking my heart.
873230	873950	They need Calibri.
873970	874370	I'm sorry.
874550	876051	I didn't like Calibri either.
876710	882294	I played Hexic 2 just to see maybe if the sequel was any better than the first one because I didn't really care for the first one too much.
882854	883655	The first one's kind of fun.
883675	885936	I found the second one to be easier, actually.
886057	886737	It was weird.
886877	887137	Really?
887177	889679	That's a good thing because the first one is really hard.
889899	897805	Yeah, I was able to create a lot of, I don't remember what they are, but basically create some sort of ring thing and it turns into something else.
897885	898145	I don't know.
898625	899986	Yeah, you can probably play a lot of that game.
900967	902268	I don't like that it's not free, though.
902970	904532	That's the only thing.
905213	907997	There's actually something I do need to mention that someone reminded me in the chat room.
908438	911282	We did have an instance of the M word in my house as I left.
911963	912584	What, Madden?
914387	914948	The M word.
916270	916510	Oh, fuck.
917293	917893	DarkSakura.com
942786	943187	Let's see.
943767	948030	Now, DarkSakura, your heart is going to break a little more based on chat comments here.
948330	951792	Gold Banjo says, Echo the Dolphin isn't even worth an emulation download.
952313	953333	Yeah, your mom!
954935	958677	Sephiroth1215 says, I didn't like Echo, but I really liked the Tides of Time.
958857	959698	Tides of Time was great.
960438	964821	RawSteelUT says, Echo would be good if it weren't harder than real-life nuclear warfare.
964841	965722	It wasn't that hard.
966718	968199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
990854	993215	I mean, that's the only thing I can think that make that game any better.
993375	996076	Alright, so I instead played demos.
996216	999277	And here's the thing, like, Bioshock, okay?
999377	1002678	Like, I was not getting excited about Bioshock at all.
1002718	1009241	I'm just like, oh hooray, it's another first person shooter, looks all sci-fi, doesn't really look like a game I want to get into.
1009301	1015223	In fact, I even went and I posted on my Twitter, because I have a lot of gaming people that I know on Twitter,
1015843	1018444	and other independent podcast people, among other things.
1018964	1023986	And I actually made a post on Twitter that said something about like, so what's the big deal?
1024206	1024627	Oh, here it is.
1024967	1026667	So what's so awesome about Bioshock?
1026707	1027528	I'm not knocking it.
1027588	1030769	I'm just curious because usually I don't get too excited for first-person shooters.
1031349	1037316	and then GamerAndy replied to me and said, frankly, it's the immersive environment jam-packed with atmosphere and the story.
1037676	1038937	Irrational makes good games.
1039238	1042181	And then I'm reading all these reviews like, what, it has like a 99 on Metacritic?
1042221	1045624	I'm like, okay, I gotta see what's so frippin' fabulous about this game, right?
1046005	1047226	So I downloaded the demo.
1048547	1049929	Oh my god, it really is that good.
1050129	1052772	Like, if the demo is any sign of what the game is gonna be...
1053632	1054693	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1071320	1075463	Looked at the fire and the water and I stood there and stared at it for like 30 seconds.
1076284	1081048	My other friend that played it too, he's just like looking at it like, damn, that looks really good.
1081248	1086672	The graphics in this game are hands down like, you know, and I really don't like reviewing a game based on the demo.
1086732	1088093	So let me say that up front.
1088253	1093858	But I think especially in this day and age, you can use a demo as a pretty good sign of what's to come for the game.
1094799	1096760	I don't think I've seen a better looking game, period.
1096980	1098521	I mean, the game looks like phenomenal.
1098962	1099402	It's amazing.
1099442	1100303	And it was scary.
1101323	1107232	I don't know though if I'll end up actually buying the full retail version just because I'm so horrible at first person shooters.
1107612	1108854	I am so bad at them.
1108954	1110076	I am too, but you know what?
1110116	1111037	I wouldn't be able to play it.
1111277	1112139	I purchased it.
1112219	1115764	I had to get the limited edition so I can get the big daddy for my desk at work.
1116909	1117950	Bioshock Bioshock
1137839	1138600	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1161605	1167790	So the game looks, I mean, it really, I mean, usually there's a part of me that wants to go, oh, it can't be that good.
1168151	1168931	It can't be that good.
1168971	1170152	Why is everybody praising this game?
1170412	1172834	It really, like, you really have to try it, like, seriously.
1173795	1176417	Anyway, going to chat room here.
1177698	1179800	Darvoid says, Bioshock demo is fun.
1180301	1182142	ChainsawJuggling says it's the best game ever.
1182182	1183203	I can't wait till Tuesday.
1183223	1186005	Sounds like they're going to have a hit on their hands there.
1186406	1189328	So, Joshi16 says, damn, I want my Bioshock.
1190149	1190549	Interesting.
1191616	1194017	Thanks for watching!
1211802	1213023	in pretty HD graphics.
1213544	1214084	And you're right.
1214204	1216646	The sad thing is, I think there's a part of me that doesn't care either.
1216727	1221951	I'll probably end up buying the damn game, despite all the drama that happened on this program because of that game.
1222551	1223192	I don't know.
1223412	1225954	It is still somewhat addicting, and I'm looking forward to multiplayer.
1226034	1232380	But I still kind of look at it with shifty eyes going, did you have to reuse the same frickin' song on the title screen?
1233189	1235551	and kind of the same gag over and over.
1235611	1235851	I don't know.
1235871	1240955	I'd like to see something a little bit different, but I'm hoping some of the new modes will make me feel a little bit better about things.
1241535	1242196	So that was that.
1242396	1243477	Otherwise, it was a three-minute demo.
1243577	1244638	I can't really tell a lot off of that.
1246819	1249401	Darvoid says, it better not be $60 Katamari.
1249581	1253024	No, it's like, I think, $30 or $40.
1253084	1253824	It's like cheap.
1253965	1254285	That's good.
1254445	1259769	NintendoManiac64 says, so Sky, is Bioshock the Ocarina of Time of first-person shooters?
1259909	1262531	Again, I don't want to base my entire opinion of a game off a demo.
1263164	1266007	Um, but it damn well could be based off of the early reviews.
1266027	1273013	Oh, Green Time wasn't that great of a game anyways, and I still don't know what everyone's, I still don't know what the hell everyone's big deal is with that game.
1273033	1277117	Yeah, in the Zelda universe, the Super Nintendo Link to the Past will always be the best one to make.
1277137	1277337	Oh, yeah.
1277697	1278558	Always be the best one.
1279839	1280079	Always.
1280940	1281741	Always, Jamie, always.
1282482	1284183	You sound like a Maxi Pet commercial, Rob.
1286825	1287166	I hate you.
1287186	1288027	You don't.
1289332	1290012	Housekeeping.
1290473	1291433	Let's do some housekeeping tonight.
1291473	1294514	Okay, the only housekeeping we really have tonight is going to affect the live listeners.
1295155	1298496	We just found out literally five minutes before we went live tonight.
1299236	1300737	We found out five minutes before we went live.
1300837	1302778	Live 365 is shutting down at 8 p.m.
1302818	1303138	tonight.
1303718	1308140	So that's going to screw some of you live listeners out of some of the perks of listening live, and we apologize.
1308160	1312322	Like the bonus segment we do in between and the afterbirth just because of the maintenance.
1312362	1314363	We're going to try and cram all the show in before 8 p.m.,
1315323	1321350	We're going to rearrange Skype line a little bit too and do it in the beginning of Part B tonight and not at the end of Part B as we usually do.
1321730	1326576	And we're going to cut out a few segments as well like the mailbag just because we got one email this whole week.
1326596	1327817	So we're going to roll it over to next week.
1328178	1329739	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1329759	1331521	We'd love to hear from you, your comments on the story.
1331782	1333303	Do you think Bioshock is all that?
1333644	1336327	I want to hear from people that played the Bioshock demo and didn't like it.
1336707	1341611	Like, please speak up, because I always love to hear devil's advocate perspectives.
1341932	1343233	So, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
1343273	1347256	And the language of the week I want to email in is Italian, even though I can't read Italian for shit.
1348197	1348917	Be quiet.
1350639	1351620	I can still read French.
1352420	1355023	Alright, so sorry you guys about the downtime tonight.
1355363	1356644	There's nothing we can really do about it.
1356664	1358686	We're going to try and finish the show before 8, but we'll see.
1359006	1364811	And I wanted to mention, though, podcast awards, they're over, you know,
1365168	1365809	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1380487	1400079	and we've always said if we can't win it ourselves it's best another independent podcast win it and another one did so there you go good job and they've had a lot of like success this year too and a lot of drama with the whole like what that lawsuit or no not one lawsuit subpoena the subpoena against them and everything try to get the Circuit City ad foreign members it's been a fun year
1400748	1402229	to be a CagCast listener.
1402830	1404011	So, good job for those guys.
1404712	1406193	You know, they're actually up for two awards.
1406293	1411858	I'd like to see them win the other one they were nominated for, but they don't find out about the other one until the actual awards ceremony.
1411878	1417163	Well, if any of them are listening, let me just tell you this much, and I think I can speak for Jamie on this.
1417503	1419185	The award show is kind of lame.
1419906	1420466	Yes, it is.
1421107	1421847	It could have gotten better.
1422208	1423409	They do have good nibbly food.
1424310	1425351	And I was about...
1426574	1430617	I would have to say by a distance of a foot and a half, I level with Adam Curry's butt.
1434019	1434740	I'm not joking.
1435160	1439423	And I couldn't really appreciate it properly because, you know, he doesn't really have a nice butt and I had the flu.
1439603	1441664	Alright, please can we get into game chat now?
1441684	1444666	Because I do not want to turn this into the Adam Curry's butt podcast.
1445267	1451091	But I will turn it into the Bioshock podcast because I'll be damned if the internet isn't abuzz about the game this week.
1451171	1452812	So I got a quick story on Bioshock.
1453152	1453612	Thanks for watching!
1476818	1477738	before people can buy them.
1477778	1480779	And apparently some Toys R Us has just made a big boo-boo and sold the game.
1480799	1482019	All the more reason not to ship them early.
1482539	1484640	So tons of people are getting this game early.
1484660	1492181	It's not just Toys R Us, but people I know that do other podcasts that for some reason get free games sent to them, even though we've never... No, I take that back.
1492201	1492741	We got a couple.
1493141	1494101	But we didn't get this one.
1494521	1495522	There's only one company that loves us.
1495542	1496102	Lots of Bioshock.
1496382	1498462	Lots of Bioshock copies floating around out there.
1498482	1501243	And of course, tens million more come Tuesday.
1501723	1502203	So there you go.
1503720	1505801	DJ Dark Knight says, huge fine.
1506161	1507062	I don't know, what do you think, Loki?
1507082	1508763	Do you think Toys R Us would get a fine over this?
1508823	1509363	I don't think so.
1509823	1519148	What they'll do is, I don't think it's Toys R Us, you know, store, like it's not chain wide, it's just, I think it was one or two stores in Jersey that were doing it.
1519308	1520368	A couple sloppy managers.
1520608	1528672	And it's just, you know, it's some idiot, and what they'll do is they'll try to track it down based on the receipts and stuff, and, you know, someone will get in trouble there, and that's about it.
1528832	1532494	You know, as long as it's not, you know, corporate wide or something, they're
1532974	1534195	It's not going to be a huge deal.
1534755	1537396	They may just get their next game or whatever shipped to them.
1538556	1539957	They won't get it before street date.
1541217	1542338	A little slap on the wrist.
1542638	1543198	Naughty, naughty.
1544058	1544538	No cookie.
1545559	1547480	Yeah, because there's Target and shit.
1547680	1549320	Target and Walmart are horrible.
1549340	1552902	Toys R Us is usually the biggest offender when it comes to breaking street date.
1553182	1553942	Funny you guys say that.
1553982	1557543	Son of Dad says, for once, it's not Target breaking massive street dates.
1557963	1560825	Joshi16 says, I would laugh if OLR got a free Madden.
1561065	1561925	Hey, you know what?
1562679	1570163	Please, send me one, because... I would laugh if we did too, because EA's pretty... Why not give it a fair shot, and give the game a fair shot?
1570203	1572745	I'm not going to hold a grudge against it just because it's a sports game.
1572785	1574145	It deserves a fair shot just like any other game.
1574165	1575706	Hey, I'm not saying it's a horrible game either.
1575746	1577767	I'm just saying I don't care for sports games.
1577987	1578928	Any sports games.
1579288	1580509	Alright, anyway, moving on.
1581289	1589113	So, if you don't have your hands on Bioshock yet, you still can get your hands on the art book, which is free to download from Irrational Games.
1589534	1589994	And, um...
1590918	1592839	BioShock Breaking the Mold Artbooks are great
1615538	1632903	Now, speaking, though, of computer-y stuff, you know, they were saying, well, at least IGN PC reviewed PC Bioshock as much better than the Xbox 360 version, saying that it handled better, the interface was better by using the mouse and the keyboard, which, if you're playing a first-person shooter, hi, duh.
1633583	1634423	Well, now, wait a minute.
1634503	1634944	Except, except, except.
1634964	1636704	I think, you know, it's personal preferences, I think.
1636724	1639805	Yeah, here's the classic debate, keyboard and mouse versus analog sticks.
1639845	1640025	I mean...
1642152	1650069	Depending on how the game was supposed to be played, the functionality of the game itself... Like, okay, what would you rather play Doom on?
1650510	1651592	PC or...
1653413	1666055	Okay, I read their review on Bioshock, and their thing was, they're saying, you know, for example, switching your special abilities using the right mouse button instead of the left bumper on the 360.
1666315	1669616	To be honest, I don't have trouble hitting the left bumper on the 360.
1670356	1671416	It's not hard.
1672496	1673317	I just don't get it.
1673477	1675637	It's just nitpicking shit, is what it is.
1675897	1680098	And they're also saying the hacking's a little bit easier because you can use the mouse instead of having to use the analog stick.
1680298	1680578	I mean, mine...
1682153	1682793	minor shit.
1682873	1683494	That's all it is.
1683934	1687175	Well, they were also pointing out, though, that you could run it at 1920x1200.
1687255	1689777	Well, I'm sure you can do it.
1689817	1690657	If you've got a PC, hi.
1690837	1692678	If you have an Uber computer that's fast enough.
1692758	1695139	I bet if I tried to run it at that resolution, it wouldn't be smooth.
1695639	1696420	That's the other problem.
1696560	1698861	I mean, but that's, you know, PC gaming in general.
1698881	1702922	You usually have to have, like, the most top-end system to play most of the newer games.
1703023	1703423	Not all.
1703583	1706964	Like, you know, games like World of Warcraft can run on pretty old machines, but, you know.
1707825	1710466	But it's meant to be available to a high audience.
1712786	1724325	I'd try it out on PC I don't know though I'm so used to those type of games now with the analogs I don't know but yeah like Quake 3 I couldn't not play that on a PC like you know there's just some games you really get used to
1724947	1728089	and if we want to go the other way around, Final Fantasy XI.
1728149	1730871	Well, yeah, we did have that issue, didn't we?
1731071	1733272	Yeah, Final Fantasy XI was made for a console.
1733292	1735253	It was made for the PlayStation 2, ported to the PC.
1735954	1738676	I can't fucking play that game with a controller for shit.
1738796	1740457	I have to have the keyboard to play that game.
1740617	1743599	But I had absolutely no problem playing it with a controller.
1744519	1749742	I started off with that crappy little Gravis pad I got for $10 from Dan's GameStop back in the day.
1750743	1753745	And I was doing all my macros and crap with my trigger buttons.
1755046	1755386	You know what?
1755426	1756947	Your wiring is backwards, I think.
1757548	1757788	What?
1759409	1761931	The games you're supposed to play with a controller, you like to play with keyboard and mouse.
1761951	1764112	The games you're supposed to play with keyboard and mouse, you like with controller.
1764312	1764812	You're backwards.
1765353	1765553	No, I'm not.
1765573	1766033	That's what it is.
1766213	1766554	Yes, you are.
1767634	1773498	That, and you know, it's kind of hard to play Doom without a keyboard because of, you know, IDDQD and IDBFG and all that.
1774219	1774539	All right.
1775180	1787910	Uh, let's see, looking at, uh, chat room for comments, uh, chat.orangelandradio.com Sephiroth1215 says, uh, FPS games are usually done in the USA, and US companies love to have the best graphics possible, and that's not possible on Wii.
1788190	1794836	Let's start a little debate there about, I'm sure Metroid Prime 3 is coming into the mix as well now, because that game's out, what, next week as well?
1794876	1795536	Or no, two weeks?
1796157	1796437	Two weeks.
1796457	1797198	Yeah.
1797998	1798619	Uh, let's see.
1799860	1800900	What else is there here?
1801321	1801421	Um...
1803140	1805582	I guess Dark Tetsuya maybe talked about that.
1805622	1809086	I wish they'd make Red Steel 2, even though they have so much room for improvement.
1810107	1811848	Lots of room for improvement.
1813210	1813630	Let's see.
1814491	1818435	Yeah, RawSteelUT says it probably costs three times as much to get a system that'll run Bioshock.
1819735	1820155	XBOX LIVE ARCADE
1849326	1851367	Every month following the launch.
1852047	1857229	So, kind of not surprising when you consider that Microsoft's been trying to bridge the gap between the console and the PC.
1857329	1858390	But, I don't know.
1859210	1860871	I don't know if I'd buy a lot of these for PC.
1860891	1865473	But my question is, if I bought it on live, would I get to download it for free on the PC?
1865693	1866313	I think I should.
1868254	1868754	Maybe you should, too.
1868774	1869354	Of course, I'm cheap.
1870595	1877478	The other thing, too, I'm wondering, is it's going to be a little bit of a harder sell to sell some of these PopCab games that are free online.
1878999	1879539	on the PC.
1879720	1885404	Yeah, but even PopCap charges extra money for a downloadable version with more features.
1885444	1886384	That's where they make their money.
1886664	1894630	Because whenever you play one of those games online, they're always saying, download the trial version of the Uber version of this game with more levels and more colors.
1894710	1895250	Woo!
1895671	1896091	And all that.
1897352	1903036	I think what's also interesting about the whole thing is that the 150 megabyte size limit still applies, even to the PC games.
1903236	1904197	That's kind of interesting to me.
1904237	1904537	I don't know.
1904877	1905898	Well... I don't know.
1907459	1907759	Anyways...
1909295	1916398	Maybe, well, actually the 150 meg limit, maybe that does tie into something that they're going to be able to be transferred back and forth or something.
1916418	1916838	I don't know.
1917238	1917738	I would hope so.
1917958	1919079	Maybe later on or something.
1919899	1920699	Um, okay.
1921099	1934104	So, and this is not a big surprise, but apparently the news got out that, um, Xbox or Microsoft, I should say, is allowing certain MMOs to require, um, hard drive space, um,
1935180	1938163	and require the use of the Xbox 360 hard drive.
1938703	1940825	Duh, I mean, Final Fantasy XI, hello, I mean.
1941886	1949452	But apparently what they're saying is that each title will create a master storage file, one file per title per console or something like that.
1950312	1955136	And apparently on the box it will say, you know, such and such storage is required.
1955597	1956938	Even though XI didn't say that, did it?
1957238	1958579	Well, I guess it had to have said it somewhere.
1958699	1960961	It must have because you had to install it to your hard drive, so.
1962757	1963077	I don't know.
1963097	1965058	I'm not surprised that MMOs require this.
1965218	1968960	I'm just surprised that normal games haven't gotten this yet.
1969200	1972662	I still think that that is coming, whether they're saying it or not.
1972822	1977364	The most shocking thing about that story to me, I was like, there's MMOs in development for the 360?
1977404	1977564	Awesome.
1979713	1982594	Wasn't there that Marvel MMO or something that was coming out to them?
1983035	1983795	That would be awesome.
1983835	1984375	I'll play that.
1984455	1985155	I don't remember that.
1985516	1986956	I'm like, what MMOs are in development for 360?
1987276	1989457	I'm just totally spacing it.
1989497	1991778	I know I've heard of something, but I can't remember.
1991838	1994079	Like, what is in development for 360 that's an MMO?
1994280	1995000	Well, I don't know.
1995280	1997601	People... Do they still play Phantasy Star Universe?
1997621	1999022	Oh my god, World of Warcraft.
1999062	1999722	It must be true.
1999802	2000983	World of Warcraft is coming to 360.
2001063	2001323	Oh, shut up!
2001343	2003744	World of Warcraft is never coming to 360.
2003844	2005405	Leave it on the damn PC.
2005465	2006005	Ragnarok 2.
2007435	2008296	Now that would be sweet.
2008816	2011598	I have to have a Korean social security number, apparently.
2013119	2013579	Sucks.
2013999	2017882	Well, no, there's ways of getting around it, but I've been trying to play the Ragnarok 2 demo.
2017902	2019683	You're going to have to kidnap a Korean child.
2020743	2021724	There's other ways to do that.
2021744	2022805	I don't want a Korean child.
2023465	2024706	Oh, DJ Dark Knight has a good point.
2024726	2027248	A fancy star universe is also another MMO on the 360.
2027288	2028368	That's what I just said.
2029029	2035133	In fact, the add-on comes out this fall for it, if people are still playing that game.
2035153	2035833	Guess who quit?
2037253	2038914	DarkTetsuya says find at
2068325	2069565	Did you hear about the baby this week?
2069585	2070365	That's not in Korea.
2070385	2070986	No, that was China.
2071026	2071666	That's China.
2072326	2073266	Get your countries right.
2073286	2074847	Get your Asia right, Dark Tetsuya.
2075107	2075287	Shame.
2075327	2076747	God, really?
2076847	2077787	That was still kind of funny.
2078247	2078747	A little funny.
2078787	2080048	Even if it was wrong, it was funny.
2080288	2080648	I know.
2081268	2081568	You know what?
2083689	2084569	Read the news, people.
2085409	2086269	Go on Yahoo.
2086989	2091711	Instead of reading about celebrities and Paris Hilton's stupid ass, read World News.
2091731	2093351	But what if I like to read about celebrities?
2093371	2093631	It's like...
2094602	2095983	Perez Hilton is like in my day.
2096203	2101185	Like I always visit, okay, you gotta visit Kotaku and Destructoid and Joystick and Perez Hilton.
2101685	2103286	That's basically how I, you know.
2103806	2104146	Okay.
2105367	2106207	Surf the net every day.
2107088	2113271	I go to Yahoo News and then I go to CNN.com and then I read my live journal.
2113351	2114511	No one cares about a browsing habit.
2114531	2115191	Let's go to the next story.
2116012	2116952	And then I go to PornoTube.
2117713	2122795	Well, while Steel UT apparently needs an explanation, some people in China wanted to name their child at...
2123419	2124200	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2143106	2145487	My Chemical Romance is going to be in Guitar Hero 3.
2145587	2148748	They're doing a three-pack.
2148948	2152589	I'm sorry, not Guitar Hero 3, Guitar Hero 2 on Xbox 360.
2152649	2164252	They are doing a three-song pack for Xbox Live Marketplace that will have teenagers' famous last words, and this is how I disappear.
2165332	2168493	It is 500 points, a.k.a.
2168513	2168493	$6.25.
2168533	2170874	And I believe it's actually up now.
2171014	2172514	They're master tracks, by the way, from the band.
2173240	2175942	And I believe we have a little clip of those songs.
2176402	2184108	So, cause, like, well, you know, cause, because, like, I have no idea who my, well, I know who they are, but I don't really listen to these type of bands.
2184128	2185349	They did one song that I like.
2186030	2186290	I don't.
2186310	2187491	That was Cemetery Drive.
2187571	2188752	Like, I knew none of these songs.
2189392	2190233	Play something, Rob.
2190433	2191113	Alright, let's do it.
2193855	2195637	Say, now, I'm straight as a star.
2195737	2197618	Don't leave no shit out of me.
2197658	2198799	Make you care less, that's wrong.
2224361	2228964	Hmm, the chatroom is all going, no, no, don't play that, why did you do that, why?
2230151	2233792	And Sephiroth1215, though, says, Hey, I hate emo, but the Black Parade is very good.
2234133	2234453	I don't know.
2234493	2236674	I thought the songs were kind of melodic.
2236714	2238154	They seem to fit in Guitar Hero 2.
2238654	2244196	I mean, I don't get into the whole emo versus punk versus whatever else.
2244376	2244717	I don't know.
2245037	2249498	At least you got some new fucking tracks to download for Guitar Hero 2 that are not Guitar Hero 1.
2249558	2249978	Amen.
2249998	2250679	There you go.
2250859	2254420	Can't we all agree that that's a good thing, even if you don't like the particular band they picked?
2254660	2255120	There you go.
2256201	2256601	Good job.
2257543	2262824	All right, well, speaking of Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero 3 is going to be getting Slash.
2262844	2267905	You already knew about that, but they're also going to be having Bret Michaels, if you can believe it.
2268885	2272566	Bret Michaels is going to be using his face and his image in the game, just like Slash.
2272946	2281308	And then, of course, in the game, you've got to get some Poison songs, Talk Dirty to Me by Poison, and go that far from the Bret Michaels band.
2281808	2282889	So pretty cool.
2282909	2284489	You can look forward to those songs in Guitar Hero 3.
2285473	2288995	Unfortunately, we do not have clips of those songs because I was too lazy to prearrange that before the show.
2289875	2292377	Well, way to go, Rob.
2292657	2293037	My bad.
2293558	2302502	Anyways, if you happen to be living in Australia, you'll be happy to know that the 360 Core has now been price dropped to compete with the Wii.
2303063	2304584	It is now the same price as the Wii.
2305824	2312448	And, of course, coinciding with that, the 20 gig system has also been dropped down to...
2314063	2318045	$579.95 Australian.
2320245	2321646	So that's pretty awesome as well.
2323947	2324427	I don't know.
2324927	2329229	Dropping the core system down to where the Wii is, not good enough I still think.
2331590	2332450	Well, I don't know.
2333110	2334871	I think it's interesting precedent.
2334911	2341333	I wonder if that's going to happen over here eventually where the 360 will get cut back enough where it can compete with the Wii like that.
2342686	2348948	I think it's also a matter of the markets themselves that want to make it competitive for the market it's in.
2350629	2354370	Or is it just that Nintendo kind of likes to screw the people that aren't in Japan or the U.S.
2354410	2356191	by charging more for their systems?
2356531	2359512	Because, you know, doesn't the DS and the Wii cost way more?
2359992	2363973	I guess most systems cost way more in Europe and Australia, Canada.
2364933	2365953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2388829	2395234	But it still creates an interesting choice when they are the same price in that currency, the Wii and the 360.
2395574	2398957	It's kind of a different competition than it is here in that regard.
2399157	2413768	But at the same time, if you want to argue it, I guess, that you would need to still buy a memory card in order to be able to save your games and stuff versus the Wii, which has built-in memory, although it is extremely limited.
2415473	2416794	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2437850	2458094	for anyone who has been keeping up with Sega there was a rumor going around that they were doing a Viking game called Vikings Battle of Asgard and GameStop has actually stopped listing the PS3 and Xbox 360 version of that on their forthcoming games and um
2459062	2463523	It was to be released in February 2008, but Sega's not saying anything about it.
2463623	2470704	I mean, they could say something when it comes up to the convention coming up, but other than that, they're... Nuh-uh.
2472124	2472344	Huh.
2473125	2474225	No hairy Vikings!
2476645	2477345	No fjords!
2477425	2480866	Wasn't there an old-school PC game called Vikings or something like that?
2480926	2483286	Or what was... I think it was something else.
2483526	2484887	Like the Lost Vikings or something?
2484927	2485787	Yeah, the Lost Vikings.
2485807	2486327	Is that what it was?
2487290	2489632	I think they also had a version of Super Nintendo, didn't they?
2502406	2503566	They're porting it, yeah.
2504006	2505907	Is Crazy Frog Racer already out on PC or something?
2505947	2506667	It's in the UK.
2507067	2508288	Oh my lord.
2508448	2512329	Crazy Frog is like one of those franchises that really needs to go away.
2512709	2523152	Well, anyway, look, folks, it's Graffiti is the company that's working on it, and the CEO of Graffiti, Kenneth Hurley, actually said this at a recent announcement.
2523212	2529373	Quote, we are excited to jump in on the Xbox 360 and introduce our title to the millions of gamers around the world playing on the console.
2529994	2531754	But maybe no one wants to play your damn game.
2532421	2534682	Everything about that?
2534722	2537664	Oh god, the soundtrack alone is going to make me want to put a gun to my head.
2539105	2540685	I don't get that Crazy Frog thing at all.
2540885	2543027	Have you heard the Crazy Frog songs, Jamie?
2544067	2544828	I don't know.
2545408	2546168	Please have a clip.
2546869	2547769	I will get a clip.
2548309	2549530	I will load a clip right now.
2550711	2551571	While you do the next story.
2551591	2552912	Do the next story and I will get a clip.
2553792	2559075	Alright, well, you may be waiting for Beautiful Katamari to come out in October, but
2559605	2560506	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2588922	2597980	So you can actually play as one of the cousins in the demo as well Yay, that's kind of neat Yeah, we actually have a clip of one of the new songs from Beautiful Katamari right here
2615754	2617995	You know, if my Xbox... That was Crazy Frog, by the way.
2618035	2622516	If my Xbox started making those type of noises, three Red Rings of Death wouldn't be enough.
2624217	2624977	For what I would do to it.
2625537	2630419	Well, you know, let's cleanse the palette a little bit away from retarded frog.
2631299	2631579	Okay.
2631599	2632459	Smacky the frog.
2632860	2633140	Anyway.
2634000	2637301	For people who are still playing Lost Planets, guess what?
2637581	2638381	The maps are all free.
2639002	2639762	You can just go get them.
2640562	2641182	I like free.
2642863	2642923	Um...
2646836	2647297	They're free.
2648377	2649498	What else is there to say?
2649678	2650398	Free stuff.
2650578	2651258	Go get it.
2651639	2652399	Yay, free.
2653599	2659522	I like that whole concept, though, of releasing map packs in advance for money for the hardcore people and then free for the rest of us.
2659642	2664444	Apparently, according to this, you can trade in your game and rebuy it for $10 at Toys R Us.
2666125	2666365	What?
2666965	2667926	Look at what this says.
2669387	2671748	It says you can rebuy it at Toys R Us for $9.99.
2673044	2677107	Why the fuck would you trade in your game and then re-buy it for $10?
2677367	2678628	It's a profit-making thing, I think.
2678668	2681210	I think they're saying you can sell it back for more and then buy it for cheap.
2682231	2683311	It's a money-making scheme.
2683712	2684092	Whatever.
2685313	2687034	I think that's with Madden.
2687254	2689196	What it is is the game is like $20 right now.
2690296	2693278	Joshi16 says Crazy Frog Frogger would be good.
2693359	2693719	Kill him.
2694379	2699503	They actually have Crazy Frog Racing coming out on PlayStation 2 in two weeks, actually.
2699923	2700784	Kill me now.
2701511	2703792	Maybe it'll coincide with the Xbox 360 game.
2720760	2722961	I mean, have you ever heard shittier music in your life?
2723101	2723581	I mean, really?
2724001	2727163	Like, does this make you want to go and, like, willingly listen to Britney Spears?
2727683	2729604	It makes me want to go on a car trip with you.
2732182	2737503	Hey, I've heard some of the stuff you play in your car.
2737724	2741305	I disagree with some of it.
2743105	2744665	Let's change the subject.
2746126	2748506	Our chat room's in pain, and I'm sure many of you are too.
2748827	2750187	So let's talk about release dates.
2750227	2753868	That's always a happy subject that will wake us back up and get us all happy again.
2754417	2754817	Shari Takoran
2771895	2788609	which looks to be some type of game where I don't know it looks like it's another it's by Compile Heart and this you know of course anime looking chick is offering up these little octopus looking cute things I don't really know how else to describe it it's a puzzle game though Tentacle Rape?
2789056	2789616	Suku Suku in Fuku 2
2811445	2813627	Motosukusuku is coming out.
2813707	2815969	Shut up, that's what it's called.
2817630	2820172	Okay, are there girls in like Suku Suku uniforms there?
2820353	2824456	Now, I like, check out this screenshot from PureXCure, Loki.
2824756	2827819	It looks like she wants a Suku Suku in the Ufuku.
2833524	2839008	She's showing a little bit of skirt there, hiking up a little bit.
2839629	2839889	Okay.
2839909	2839989	Okay.
2840427	2842008	Fuck PurexCure, I don't care about that.
2842048	2844269	I want to see what this Suku Suku thing is here.
2844749	2845949	It's a quiz game, though!
2847630	2848590	Quiz and variety.
2849611	2852892	I guess it's these cute little chibi bunny things.
2853092	2856094	Some are dressed as a knight, and some are dressed as little farms guys.
2856134	2858174	I guess that's Suku and that's Fuku, I don't know.
2861476	2864217	They're more descriptive terms, because Motto is more...
2865258	2882531	also coming out on the Nintendo DS Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Ring of Fates and I'm sure a lot of you guys like your Crystal Chronicles so there you go, you have that to look forward to and that's probably the biggest game this week that and Suku Suku awesome anyways, let's see
2883135	2884016	in the U.S.
2884396	2886537	Um, there's some pretty good stuff to look forward to this week.
2887018	2894222	Uh, just a little game called Bioshock on, um, PlayStation 2, or, not PlayStation 2, 360 and PC.
2894322	2897424	I meant PC for some reason I was looking at a PlayStation 2 game.
2897484	2899766	OMG, Bioshock's coming to PlayStation 3 after all.
2899866	2900646	OMG, OMG.
2900846	2901487	Oh my god, no.
2901907	2902968	It is not coming to PlayStation 2.
2903508	2905549	PlayStation 2 would melt down if they had to play that game.
2906330	2906410	Um,
2907819	2915101	On PlayStation 2, though, you can look forward to two wonderful games, including Metropolis Mania 2 and Brunswick Bowling.
2916881	2917281	Awesome.
2917681	2918102	Hooray.
2918442	2925043	On PS3 and PSP, you're going to be getting Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, the delayed edition.
2926624	2928084	Then, let's see, also...
2929728	2940697	Let's see here, on PC and 360 as well, another good RPG, Two Worlds, coming out on both platforms, as well as the Two Worlds Collector's Edition.
2942338	2952986	And let's see, on PSP, a couple more games, Jeanne d'Arc and Dragon Ears Aria is also making its way up.
2954825	2977865	On the Wii, a whole bunch of nothing And of course on the DS, Brain Age 2, more brain training in minutes a day Another game that you'll play for one whole day and then stop playing And this one was really interesting, The Settlers is coming out on DS as well Which isn't that Settlers of Catan, I think?
2978706	2979226	The Settlers?
2979727	2980207	Sounds familiar
2980680	2981200	I don't know.
2981340	2982961	I'll have to look at that.
2983161	2984861	And then Operation Vietnam.
2984881	2988823	So you too can have the flashbacks that everybody is jealous of.
2989883	2990763	All right.
2991884	3000386	Real quick before we get to the Europe dates, I just want to say in chat, Darvoid says that Sukufuku translates to summer uniform, despite what you were thinking, sicko.
3000566	3002087	That does look like a summer uniform.
3002107	3002947	Summer is not too.
3003987	3004487	Well, whatever.
3005108	3005868	Let's just move on.
3005928	3006168	Anyway.
3008618	3012123	On the 21st, we have Dragoneer's Aria on PSP.
3012323	3016008	On the 24th, we have Anno 1701 for the DS.
3016529	3018231	Blue Dragon on Xbox 360.
3018711	3020954	Glory Days 2, Brotherhood of Men on DS.
3021155	3022617	We have Loki on PC.
3023478	3024679	A bunch of Madden.
3025220	3025861	Fuck Madden.
3026730	3040754	MotoGP07 Sucks It's the husband No, I detest American football It's stupid Play rugby Is Loki coming to Mac?
3041314	3049537	No, it's PC That's right, Loki does not come to Mac I knew that was coming Can I continue?
3049577	3054498	Yes, you may Thank you, sir On the 24th we have Pac-Man Rally
3055180	3061004	24th also is Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 for PS3 and PSP.
3061844	3063966	And 24th is Bioshock.
3065306	3065947	No, Bioshock.
3065967	3068428	Are you going to hate that too?
3068628	3068809	No.
3068989	3071490	If they did a PS2 version, you'd think it'd be like BioFizz.
3073351	3073992	BioZap.
3075513	3075773	Alright.
3077379	3079100	I hope Mr. Bubbles gets a spin-off game.
3079120	3080500	That's all I hope for.
3081260	3083781	He should have his own Saturday morning cartoon show.
3084181	3086362	Mr. Bubbles Happy Hour!
3087202	3090003	There should be a fighting game, Mr. Bubbles vs. Pyramid Head.
3090883	3091663	Pyramid Head would win.
3091683	3092943	That would be hardcore.
3093324	3093744	Pyramid Head.
3094004	3096765	They need to do, like, scary games of the fighter.
3097725	3102486	In a fight, though, between Mr. Bubbles, or, you know, the Big Daddy and Pyramid Head.
3102786	3105067	Mr. Bubbles, Pyramid Head, and the Liquor.
3106538	3115289	I'm sorry, I would say, though, I think that, you know, seeing the demo, how fast those, you know, big daddies move, and Pyramid Head's just dragging that shit along.
3115309	3116290	I mean, he's kind of slow.
3116330	3119234	Yeah, but the only way you can kill Pyramid Head is for him to kill himself.
3120868	3122209	P-Hitty P-Hitty P-Hitty
3143473	3144133	It's P. Hetty.
3145414	3147795	Well, it was OLR versus AGI, right?
3147835	3153697	So it would be, like, you, me, and Loki are all playable characters, and Scott, Mary Young, and Jessica are all playable characters.
3153737	3159439	Then maybe, like, Bobby B for good measure, and we could put one of our people, like, Travis Donovan or DMN or somebody can be a playable character.
3160539	3161219	And then P. Hetty.
3162360	3163120	It's just random.
3163200	3164320	It just shows up.
3165141	3165861	Random boss.
3166001	3167121	He'd be, like, Noob Saibot.
3168422	3170442	He'd be Smoke.
3171103	3171643	All right, uh...
3173089	3173669	Moving on.
3175830	3177971	Chat room is very random here.
3178151	3184314	GS68 says, I want DarkSakura the game, which would more or less be Burnout OLR Edition.
3185814	3186895	You don't know how right you are.
3187675	3189476	You just totally see her driving down the freeway.
3190316	3191037	Let's see what else is there.
3191117	3193278	Joshi16 says, Bioshock on the Atari 2600.
3193318	3196399	That would be interesting.
3196803	3197263	Wipeout HD
3222243	3223624	It was already formally announced.
3223664	3224665	We know the game is coming.
3224725	3229929	It was already said that it was coming at E3 2007, and it's supposed to be released before the end of the year.
3230649	3233151	Wipeout HD, of course, will have high def.
3233851	3234992	It's Wipeout for the PlayStation 3.
3235212	3235933	What else do you need to know?
3236133	3241557	Why can't they just release a demo on the PlayStation Network since there's hardly any demos on there in the first place?
3242137	3252682	because people are really critical of demos and stuff and they probably want to make sure that, you know, because even though I said earlier I wasn't going to base my full opinion of a game off a demo, there's a lot of people that will.
3252782	3253803	And I'm not perfect either.
3253903	3254723	I've done it before.
3254903	3258625	So there you go.
3259345	3264888	Another interesting thing, apparently calling all cars is going to be transferable to the PSP.
3265308	3266228	At least that's the rumor.
3266248	3267209	Yeah.
3268254	3273158	And this is coming from a European magazine, PSP, the official guidebook.
3274138	3281744	And no word on if that's even true or not, but it would be interesting.
3282184	3282545	I don't know.
3283665	3287909	Maybe sell some more copies on PSP that way.
3290470	3290711	I don't know.
3290731	3292032	Is anyone interested in this game?
3292632	3293913	I know I looked at it and I was like, eh.
3293933	3295054	I have no idea what you're talking about.
3295854	3296675	I've been ignoring it.
3298894	3299454	Alrighty then.
3301716	3304458	I mean, like, is it supposed to be exciting?
3305598	3310602	Um, well, the game itself, you know, basically is kind of a cops and robbers type thing.
3310662	3313463	It's all done, you know, cartoony, cel-shaded and stuff.
3314664	3316605	Yeah, wasn't that, wasn't actually that an old show?
3316946	3317066	No.
3317786	3319487	Oh, that was Car 54, Where Are You?
3319848	3320488	Yeah.
3320608	3324811	I think there was a show called Calling All Cars, but I think it has nothing to do with this, actually.
3325251	3325371	Oh.
3326532	3327312	I, I, I, I've,
3329666	3332908	I like the fact that it's transferable.
3332948	3334208	That's kind of a neat feature.
3334268	3339690	I mean, that's something that Xbox Live is never going to be able to really deliver because there is no portable Microsoft system yet.
3340190	3341571	But that's kind of neat.
3341971	3342231	I know.
3342291	3342491	Wait.
3343243	3355394	Well, for anybody else, though, who's interested in anything Sony has going on, there are going to be... They've actually got some dates released from 3 Speech for UK.
3355474	3365724	First coming out is Warhawk on the 28th of August on PSN, and 21st September release for Blu-ray.
3367065	3367666	And also...
3368999	3370339	It's going to cost £19.99 at €29.
3370459	3388104	It will be, let's see, there will be extra video content, a manual, and a Bluetooth headset if you pay the £39.99 to get it on the Blu-ray hard copy.
3391727	3402793	Heavenly Sword is going to be rumored as the 14th of September with Folklore and Lair on 12th and 26th October, of course, respective.
3403373	3408636	And that's nothing really yet said about SingStar for PS3.
3408656	3411878	Will you guys be getting Lair at your house, Jamie?
3412178	3413279	Because I really want to see that game.
3414315	3415435	We could get it.
3415635	3417676	I mean, we can rent whatever we want to.
3417696	3418236	Oh, that's cool.
3418296	3427038	Because I'm kind of, you know, I still haven't bought a PlayStation 3, but there are certain games I really would like to see that, you know, may change my opinion on PlayStation 3 and finally get one, and that's one of them.
3427278	3429359	I can't remember if I have Lair on order or not.
3429519	3432420	I think I'm getting, I know I'm getting Heavenly Sword.
3433060	3433660	Oh, yeah, that too.
3433900	3436941	And then Ratchet and Clank Future Tools of Destruction.
3437081	3439621	I think by Christmas I'll have finally caved and buy a PlayStation 3.
3440742	3441022	I think.
3441642	3441942	We'll see.
3442808	3444671	Longer you wait, the better a deal you're going to get.
3444691	3445152	That's true.
3445312	3446294	So I'm trying to hold out.
3446795	3449679	Well, also the fact that I just don't have a lot of money right now.
3449920	3455068	And just remember, all the good games you're looking forward to aren't coming out until next spring at least.
3455669	3455870	True.
3456190	3456330	True.
3456591	3457292	Anyways, I'll hold up.
3459919	3467541	Well, moving on, let's talk about free, because if I can't buy new consoles, then I'm going to get free stuff, because I like free stuff.
3467661	3469722	One thing that's now free is ArcLord.
3470642	3478904	If you are an MMO fan, hopefully you've heard of this game, but if you haven't, Codemasters Online Gaming has made its online RPG, ArcLord.
3479244	3480945	Completely free to play.
3481325	3484026	There's an all-new expansion also available for download.
3484666	3497470	The director of marketing at COG noted, quote, Since its release, Arc Lord has grown consistently, and we are excited to throw open the doors to players across North America and Europe looking to play a premium, 100% free MMORPG.
3498191	3499071	There's got to be a catch.
3499611	3500171	What's the catch?
3501572	3502332	There must be a catch.
3502952	3503512	I don't know what it is.
3503532	3504213	No one's playing it.
3504233	3505573	Is there ads or something?
3506433	3508014	It says, I'm looking at the official website here.
3509436	3511377	Zero Fees, download the free game now.
3511417	3512877	I might check it out just for shits and giggles.
3513558	3518679	I thought that was... Someone said that that was Overlord based off that game, and I don't think so, but... Possibly.
3518739	3520140	The name sounds familiar.
3520620	3522540	Yeah, it does have a very similarish name.
3524101	3526962	RossDLUT says, next week, ArcLord closes down.
3527742	3528782	Enjoy it while it lasts.
3529983	3534524	Well, speaking of enjoying it while it lasts, yes, you may...
3535109	3542152	Be familiar with a wonderful spin-off into the porno world called World of Warcraft.
3542712	3543532	Well, guess what?
3543592	3550635	They've decided to move off of World of Warcraft and move into the ever-expanding realm of first-person shooters.
3551375	3554356	Yes, they have just created FPS porn.
3554736	3557317	Operation Sex, Cock and Load.
3559018	3561279	That is the actual fucking name of this thing.
3561839	3564800	It is a gaming-themed porn series, um,
3565404	3576970	That is, of course, based off of games like Counter-Strike, Ghost Recon, and Rainbow Six and involves a lot of people running around shooting fake guns and yelling stuff and sex.
3578604	3578924	Damn it.
3579324	3581185	That's the best combination ever.
3581485	3584426	That's a list list in the making we need to do next week.
3585046	3586927	Random things you should have in a porn game.
3586947	3589068	No, what video game should be turned into porn?
3589508	3589608	Oh.
3590108	3590869	Like Biocock.
3591149	3593530	Could be maybe an FPS that comes out in the future.
3593930	3595330	Cocking Mama.
3595370	3596351	Cocking Mama?
3598471	3600032	What the hell is wrong with you?
3601533	3603833	Mama will fix it, naughty boy.
3606715	3607735	Okay, I didn't say that.
3609560	3612782	Attention, Internet, DarkSakura would like to see CockingMama.
3613622	3615923	No!
3615963	3616424	Not me.
3618305	3619605	I was just thinking of names.
3620246	3626249	Looking at comments in the chat room, NintendoManiac64 says, FPS, First Person Sex?
3627009	3628290	No, it's not First Person Sex, because...
3628934	3630895	That's POV sex, by the way.
3630935	3632795	That's a whole different genre.
3632815	3633755	Just stop.
3633795	3634336	Just stop.
3634596	3644078	This is actually first person where they've got the gun and everything and they're firing the gun and they're reloading it just like you would see in a first person shooter game, except they stop and have sex every now and then.
3644098	3644578	They stop and reload.
3644598	3649480	Because when you're in the middle of terrorist warfare, you have to stop and have sex.
3649500	3653681	They have to reload.
3654001	3655081	This is so mature tonight.
3655441	3657502	Rosteel UT sticks his head in a meat grinder.
3660513	3661073	Yay!
3661133	3661974	Good job!
3662034	3664716	You got the guy who's always ragging on us, put his head in the meat grinder.
3664756	3665257	No, I'm just kidding.
3665897	3668219	ACHP said, Cocking Mama Cock Off.
3668880	3671041	Joshi16 says, Train your cock in minutes a day.
3671922	3674564	RastielUT says, Cooking Mama Bobbit.
3675925	3682611	Footy Mama Footy in Toronto says, Ninten Cats in itself is a sex game.
3682631	3683211	Ninten Pussy.
3684352	3685113	We are so mature.
3686588	3688429	and Tingle the RPG.
3689070	3692372	This show has sunk to the level of dick and fart jokes.
3692412	3693452	Congratulations, everybody.
3693612	3694093	Good job.
3694473	3697354	Hey, you ever remember X-Man and Custer's Revenge?
3698155	3699736	Of course I remember Custer's Revenge.
3699756	3702117	I haven't played X-Man, but I've heard you talk about it.
3703318	3703678	Got it.
3703738	3704299	Good times.
3704639	3706500	All right, let's take a break.
3707648	3708769	That sounds like a good idea, Ron.
3708809	3710109	Yeah, this show's getting a little crazy.
3710350	3711250	So we're going to take a quick break.
3711270	3714492	We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
3714852	3719835	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
3720275	3724598	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
