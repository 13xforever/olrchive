Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, August 19th, 2007, for part B of episode number 243 of our podcast.
Yes, we've been doing this a little while.
Of course, on our show, if you're brand new to our program, we like to discuss the latest in video games and gaming culture.
And, you know, we're three gamers that all met playing DDR at an arcade and
We've known each other for about five years doing this program and just kind of like to give our share.
And of course, it's all about what you guys have to say as well.
And you can always interact with our program through the chat room or through our Skype line or our voicemail or mailbag.
You can always send us emails to mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com because if we can do a show, if any old idiots like us can do a show, then you guys should be able to be a part of it as well.
So anyhow, let's get back into the gaming news.
Started off with some talk about Mario Kart coming out on the Wii.
There's some brand new details about Mario Kart on the Wii.
apparently a couple of screenshots, new screenshots actually hit the internet this week and so it gives some more details about what's going on of course the tracks appear to be bigger and better as you would expect on a new console you can do jumps, little jumps again, the jump button is back 12 player racing online, shortcuts within the tracks as well mid-air stunts apparently can be done in the game as well
and tracks being carried over from Mario Kart Double Dash, which is cool because some of the classic tracks, of course, have awesome design in them.
So I'd like to see the old school Rainbow Road come back one more time because I wasn't as big of a fan of the new school Rainbow Roads as the old one.
Mario Kart 64, I think, was probably one of the best.
I love Mario Kart 64.
That's one of the few Nintendo 64 games I really, really adore.
Which, by the way, I forgot to say in Part A during my gaming week, I played F-Zero 64.
I didn't care for it.
I know, Jamie, you said you loved that one.
I didn't really care for it.
I do see, though, now where a lot of GX, the GameCube one, came from, because it totally feels like an earlier version of F-Zero GX.
I thought Mario Kart 64 was a way better racer on the Nintendo 64 than F-Zero, sadly.
Which makes me sad, because I love my F-Zero.
But, oh well.
Anyhow.
Anyways, some interesting news in the homebrew scene on the Wii.
Apparently, if you have a mod-chipped Wii, they have just enabled it to be able to play DVDs, as if you really need to do that.
But, in case you're interested, what you can do is actually using a, I guess, clone CD, like some special boot CD that you create.
You'll boot it with your Wii that's got...
I guess it's a mod that's programmed in Wyo Assembly 1.8, and I guess they use this program called Wii Boss.
And then what you do is you just mount the disc and pop in the DVD.
So you get to play it using the Wii Remote, of course, as the remote for it.
I don't know, it's kind of gimmicky, kind of cool.
Hopefully something that they can implement later on, since it looks like the Wii is fully capable, of course, playing DVD movies.
There has to be some sort of functionality already built in that they're going to release something for later.
Seems so weird how Nintendo does that.
They love to do these time release things on their consoles.
Like, you know, DS, surprise, it goes online.
Surprise, it has voice chat.
Surprise.
It's just interesting.
Nintendo has some very interesting strategies sometimes.
Well, I think that as a company, they're very far-seeing.
You know what I mean?
They look at the big picture, the...
They have a vision and stick to it.
There was speculation on this article by Gizmodo.
They were saying that
Possibly later on, since the whole issue was DVD licensing fees, I guess the license, the technology to play back DVD video, obviously they didn't want to increase the cost of the Wii, so what you could possibly do later on is get a DVD channel for your Wii downloaded off of WiiWare, and then you pay the money for the licensing fee up front, there you go, pop that in and you can play DVDs.
Well, AZHP brings up an interesting point in our chat room.
There can't be anything already in the Wii that can play DVDs because they need to buy the licensing to include that software.
It's not legal for them to add in DVD compatibility and time release it.
Interesting.
Son of Dad said the Dreamcast was going to have DVD playback, but it never happened.
I still don't think that there's any problem because really the DVD, the audio and video...
Really, that's just a particular file, and if the Wii is already set up to read those types of files, then having specific DVD playability in the Wii is not the issue.
It was not made with that intent.
It would just be able to read those files already.
It needs the software, I think.
Ross Deal UT says, what a thinly veiled attempt to justify pirate mod chips, since, hey, it plays DVDs.
Oh, and by the way, you can play copied games.
Interesting thought.
Nintendo's always, well, this whole thing that surprised me about modding the Wii and about their import policy with it is that they never, I guess, really cared that much in the past, given that in every other system except the GameCube, it was all physical lockout.
At least with the TurboGrafx, it was a difference in the pin sets on the HuCards.
And there was no real good converter.
I have the one that was supposed to be the best.
It doesn't work.
So, except for the CD games, there was no country coding, but there were still new CD games.
But, I don't see exactly why they're as all up in arms on this when, you know, Sony's like, hey, you can play them, here.
Well, you know.
It's kind of an old debate at this point for me, but, you know, I think everything should be region-free.
I don't understand the intent to region-lock things, especially, I mean, I can understand because of the DVD licensing, you have to region-lock things, but with the Wii, if you don't have DVD playback, you don't need to region-lock things.
I don't think you have to region-lock everything with DVDs and stuff.
I mean, look at the... Unless it's porn.
I mean, the PlayStation 3, granted, it's Blu-ray, but, you know, that's region-free.
The PSP's region-free.
DS is region-free.
Game Boy Advance region free.
I mean, I don't see what the point is.
If anything, you're going to be selling more copies of games because people are going to buy, like, say, Owen Dunn and then buy Elite Beat Agents.
Hey, you sold an extra copy in Japan.
Who cares if they paid money to have it shipped over here?
That's their money.
I mean, but you sold an extra copy because of that.
Is that really a bad thing?
And then we're going to get a Ninja Pass, but that's another story.
Jaded says, Nintendo is a toy company.
They produce toys, not DVD players.
GS68 says because if you buy the Japanese version of a game that has a North American version it could cause problems with your region's market interesting alright well if you want to chat with us join our chatroom chat.orangeloungeradio.com and give us your two cents well for anybody who is still keeping up with anything about the virtual console in the way I do have the update for the UK
As you were saying previously, Wave Race 64 is out for 1,000 points.
It translated to 7 pounds, 10 euro.
And, well, it's Wave Race, which I didn't really care for.
You also have Crater Maze from the TurboGrafx-16.
600 Wii points, 420 pounds, 6 euro.
And I think that's it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and some weird games coming out for the PlayStation 2 very soon.
A brand new accessory is coming out for the PlayStation 2 and Into Games is supposed to be revealing this at the Games Convention in Leipzig.
It's a Wiimote, basically, for the PlayStation 2.
I probably shouldn't call it that.
It's a motion-sensing pad for the PlayStation 2.
The games that are going to be coming out for it, Real Play Tennis, Real Play Pool, Real Play Golf...
RealPlay Racing, RealPlay Bowling, and RealPlay Puzzle Spear.
Hmm, I've heard of some of these games before.
The little sensing pad is supposed to emulate tennis rackets, pool cues, golf clubs, and steering wheels, amongst others.
Hmm.
I heard a voice of disagreement over there, Loki.
What do you think?
It's gimmicky shit.
That's what it is.
I've seen the pictures of them, and it's not what you think.
It's not a game pad, per se.
It's not like the Wii Remote.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, on the other hand, I can't help but feel like I've played these games before, and when games start feeling unoriginal, I don't know about you guys, but I get a little bit angsty.
Do you guys get a little bit angsty?
All the time.
Well, that means it's time to bring on the FUs of the week.
Jamie, why don't you start us off?
Um...
F you to headaches that develop into nosebleeds.
That's no fun.
No, it's not.
Is that it?
And also an F you to nosebleeds while I'm busy drinking.
Loki.
Loki.
Um, F you to pompous little jerks that think they can drive their truck around like it's a fucking race car.
Um, actually this was funny, we saw this last night while we were at the movie theater.
This dumbass blowing through tons of stop signs in the parking lot, driving like 50 miles an hour.
And you know, usually it's like, where the fuck are the cops when you need them?
There just happened to be a cop right when you needed him.
Pulled the bastard over, it was awesome.
I laughed my ass off.
Good times.
Justice is served.
My FU goes to this weird cavity thing I have in my mouth.
It's not like a tooth cavity, but I think like one of my crowns is coming off or something, and now there's like a cavity, and it sucks because it hurts, and now I have to go to the dentist, and I hate going to the dentist.
Because I... Oh, God, the dentist makes you feel so stupid.
I don't know about you guys, but I hate my dentist.
So I've hated every single one.
I think there's only been like one dentist I've ever gone to I ever liked.
You should go to my dentist.
He's very great.
He probably doesn't take my insurance.
F you to my dentist insurance, not letting me go to very many dentists.
I always fall asleep.
Let's see.
Just F you to the dentist in general.
Not my favorite thing to do.
Wah.
Okay, just kind of following up with the story here.
I know this is really bad radio, but this is what they are.
Those are the controllers for the real thing.
Oh, God, those look like those crappy attachments that they came out with for the Wii.
That's the worst thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
Except they're not.
They just have little sensors and shit on them, so...
Yeah, it's not a whole lot to get excited about, but hey, I mean, if you're into that kind of stuff and you don't want to go out and buy an actual Wii system and you want to be able to bowl at home and stuff, great, buy the game.
It's only like 30 bucks anyway, so.
So it's not really a Wiimote coming to the PlayStation 2, but it's these, you know, Wii-like technologies coming to the PlayStation 2.
Something like that, yeah.
Alright.
I don't know.
Now, what's also interesting, this kind of leaked out during an online demo for, I believe it was for another game, during Unreal Tournament 3, they had accidentally paused the game or something, and a gamer card screen popped up that's going to be tied in with home.
And apparently, you know, the PlayStation Network will be getting a similar type of thing with their home service, and...
My guess is going to be very similar to what Xbox has right now with their live service.
What's interesting, though, is Gamer Card might sound familiar, seeing as there's that whole My Gamer Card thing as part of Xbox.
I don't know.
Great.
Well, I mean, if it's not broken, why fix it?
It's not the most original idea, but...
It's good that they're getting something else, I guess.
Joshi16 says, Sony innovating again.
Brilliant.
Innovation.
Yeah, that's the key word.
All right.
Well, if you guys want to comment on this, we're actually going to open our Skype line a little bit early tonight.
If you weren't listening to Part A, unfortunately, the live stream is getting shut off at 8 p.m.
or so we're being told for some maintenance.
So to make sure that our live listeners get a chance to interact with us tonight before the plug is pulled on the live stream and we have to finish the show with no live interaction, we want to open up our Skype line.
So please...
Head on over and give us a call.
1-866-GAME-OLR.
Sorry, is it 1-866 or 1-877?
877.
God damn it.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Get it right, Rob.
I think I know it after this amount of time.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
So just waiting for a call to come in and we'll take it.
Bioshock Bioshock
Yeah, but I want to ask you that the minigame, the hacking minigame, are you good at that game?
Rob, you said you didn't do it, didn't you?
I wasn't able to complete it, but I only tried it one time.
It reminded me.
It's Pipe Dream.
That's what it was, Pipe Dream.
Or that game on PopCap Games with the little Chinese fireworks.
I don't remember the name of that game, but it reminded me of both those games.
And yeah, it's real easy.
Here's my trick in the whole thing.
You just flip over all the tiles if you can.
That's my trick.
Yeah.
Connect them.
Is there, like, why wouldn't you want to flip over all the tiles?
Is there, like, a downside to flipping them over?
You pay money.
Not that I found out.
You pay money?
Yeah, you know, it's either hack it or pay money.
Oh.
Oh, well, no.
When you're flipping over the tiles, you don't pay money.
It's just... No, no, no.
If you lose, then your health goes bad.
You can pay money to just have it automatically hack, or you can do the tile thing.
But, yeah, I don't understand why you wouldn't flip over all the tiles.
Yeah, just some...
Some people I talk to go like, the game's hard.
This is really hard.
You're supposed to flip over every tile and try to figure out shit.
That seems to kind of defeat the purpose if you just go in there and flip over every tile.
There are some other tiles that are in the actual game.
I'm not sure if there's a downside to flipping over tiles.
Maybe that's one of the differences where the demo and the real game are a little different.
I'll have to ask someone I know that already owns the game.
What did you want to say about the hacking, RavensDolphin?
Well, you know, yesterday I showed how I can be very good at the hacking.
I showed everyone that I can get it done quite quickly.
And they went like, oh, it's very hard.
I went like, it's not hard.
And I showed them that it's not hard.
And what did they do?
Were they calling you names because you just flipped over every tile?
That was your trick, or what?
No, they just went like, I can never get through the hacking.
Like the little mini-game, I'm like, I'm going to show you how to get through it.
Well, I believe in the full version of the game you're supposed to be able to hack the vending machines.
There's other stuff you can hack, too.
There's other things that hack in the game.
Can't wait for it though.
Yeah, are you excited about Bioshock?
Yeah, but the thing about, there's an interesting story about this game for me.
I can't remember pre-ordering it at all.
EB says I have a pre-order for it, so someone must like me.
You think somebody went in there and put a pre-order down for you?
I don't know.
I just can't remember for the life of me why I have a pre-order for it.
Alright, well one more thing Raven's Dolphin.
Yeah, there was one more thing.
This is about Bioshock.
When you first saw Rapture, was your jaw on the floor like, that can't be right?
Like when you first go down into the city?
Yeah.
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
and 2K to some extent did this with their last game, Prey, which I actually talked about on this program a lot and it was actually a first person shooter I really liked was Prey because it was set up for dummies like me who could never die in Prey.
I loved it.
For the hardcore FPS fan, they hated it, but it was also set up very much like a movie.
But I don't know, Bioshock pulls it off in a different way that's much more engrossing than even Prey.
One last thing.
Of course.
Next gen flushing.
I enjoyed flushing the toilet and see it actually going down.
Which way did it spin?
Which way did it flash?
That's a good question, because it is the bottom of the ocean.
Because this city is supposed to exist at the bottom of the ocean.
So the question is, does it spin a different way?
What part of the world was it in?
I don't remember.
I said that now we have next-gen flushing, and this is next generation.
Flushing and water.
You could flush the toilet in Duke Nukem 3D.
You could flush the toilets in Final Fantasy VI.
But not like this.
You can't just go up to it and just flush it.
If you go in the bathroom in the palace...
You can kneel on the toilet.
I guess that's the problem.
And you move off of it and it flushes.
Really?
So do all the boys sit when they pee?
It's everybody kneels on the toilet.
But you can also flush them in Animal Crossing, too, if you sit on them like a chair.
You guys are very bored.
I have to say, that certainly lets you know that the creators of the game have gotten it down to every last freaking detail when the toilet flushes and everything.
The fact that you can run around and eat all the food and smoke all the cigarettes, and apparently you can also play the guitars in the game.
Holy Shonen in chat says, LOL, the ideal of next gen, flushing toilets.
Gold Banjo says, OMG, how far technology has taken us.
It's exciting.
All right.
I'm feeling very confident about people's gaming.
I'm glad DarkSakura is feeling my thing.
I was just shocked as well, just flushing that toilet.
We're like, this is it.
This is next gen.
All right.
Well, we're going to let you go.
This gives me hope for the future.
So you can go get your copy of Bioshock and flush all the toilets, okay?
All right, bye.
Yeah, they... Actually, they've been doing a lot of restructuring because they have really bad money management because of the whole hot coffee incident.
They poured millions of dollars down that.
They're actually way down.
Yeah, and especially the fact that they don't really have anything new coming out this year now also kind of has to hurt them a little bit.
Yeah, definitely.
So, yeah.
Is that all you wanted to comment on, or is there other stuff tonight?
Well, um...
I don't know, I didn't really get into the feed until after Part B, and Part B wasn't that long.
Well, I know, because we have to make sure we get the Skype in before 8 o'clock tonight, but our podcast will still have everything in it, all the stories and everything.
Well, what games have you been playing this week?
I've been playing a lot of Half-Life 2, actually.
Yeah?
Because I just got a new computer, and I got this headset just so I could Skype in and call you guys.
Awesome!
Cool, thank you.
So wait, you brought a brand new computer?
So is it like a top of the line, or is it like a Costco computer, or what?
It's kind of a budget computer.
It's like a Dell, $600.
I was like, eh, I want something that plays games, but I don't want something that will kill my wallet.
So you probably won't be playing Bioshock on it.
Ah, man, I wish I could.
Do you have a 360?
No, I just have a Wii for now.
I'm not getting into the next gen until...
They fixed the stability issues on the Xbox 360.
You know, actually, Ross Steele kind of brings up a follow-up point in the chatroom.
Ross Steele, UT, says as far as Take-Two, because 2K is a part of that, and says they almost have nothing other than GTA.
Bioshock might be their first post-GTA hit.
So maybe they do have a game this year that's going to bring in the money.
I thought it was 2K that was doing Bioshock.
It is 2K that's doing Bioshock, but don't they all roll up in Take-Two?
Take-Two owns 2K and they also own Rockstar.
Yeah, so it's just different subsidiaries of Take-Two.
Oh, I see.
Interesting.
I just wanted to, like, every time a great game comes out for the Xbox 360, I'm like, man, I wish I had an Xbox 360.
And then I hear stories of like, oh man, my Xbox 360 broke just before this game came out.
What am I going to do?
And I'm like,
I don't want to get that anymore.
Well, at least they have the warranty thing, so it's a little better now.
All right.
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
No, that's about it.
All right.
Well, thank you so much for calling, and have a good week, okay?
Yeah, you too.
Have fun with the new computer.
All right.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
I wonder if he'll be playing World of Warcraft on that computer because there's a lot of people who go out and get those budget computers to play World of Warcraft.
We'll see.
We'll take a couple more calls.
If you'd like to give us a call, again, the number is 1-877-GAME-OLR.
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
But don't call now because we have another call on the line right now.
Hi.
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, guys.
What's up?
It's FootyMonster.
Hello, FootyMonster.
What's on your mind?
Nothing much.
I actually wanted to share with you guys something that I learned during the past day.
The Hannah Montana game for the DS actually seems to be really good.
What is this?
Hannah Montana, you know, that Disney show?
Wait, wait, wait.
Hannah Montana for the DS is good?
Yes.
Another one that's a platformer that's out already, but the one that's going to come out soon.
Now, how do you know this?
Because I checked the video that was posted on DS Fanboy on Friday.
And basically the game is like jam sessions for the DS where you have the guitar, you can strum it and play chords and stuff.
But take this to the next level where you can not only strum but also pick individual strings.
Also you get a full drum kit in which you can actually play everything on the drum.
A bass guitar, and also you have connectivity with other DSs, and you can play on Wi-Fi.
Each person takes an instrument.
You can all jam together, actually.
The chat room is all surprised that you're serious.
I'm serious.
I'm completely serious.
It looks like Rock Band meets Jam Sessions with a really bad IP sticking on the front.
I see.
So Hannah Montana is a music game that looks to be really good, basically.
Yeah.
It's a music game.
So it's not good because I don't get to punch her in the face or anything.
That's not what makes it good, right?
It's actually a good game.
Wow.
It seems to be a good game.
I mean, I actually called to Bobby Blackpool's show before and he said that he thinks that he heard that they might re-release
without the IP, like the Hannah Montana IP slapped into it, like developers.
That would be hilarious if they did that.
Can you guys think of any other games that were like that, that were actually pretty good games that just had a crappy brand on it?
I'm trying to think if there's anything else.
I'm like, surely there was something else in gaming history.
Maybe the chat room can think of something.
Like, was there a great concept for a game or a great game that just got totally screwed by the IP that was attached to it?
Cool Spot?
Oh, Spot, the video game?
Yeah, Cool Spot.
Oh, like all the way back in the NES days?
Super NES.
Oh, I don't remember that one.
I remember the old board game one that was kind of like Othello.
Well, no, this is with the Spot from 7-Up.
7-Up, yeah.
So he had a game on the NES.
There were the Noid games.
Yeah, as a platformer.
The Noid games?
Wasn't he good?
They were actually kind of... They were...
A good waste of time.
Oh!
Vector Man.
Sneak King.
Hello.
We did have one recently.
But actually, I don't know.
The Burger King IP kind of made it, actually.
I don't know.
I wouldn't say that was a bad IP.
But, huh.
And now I'm just curious about if High School Musical 2, the game, is going to be coming out any soon.
I still have Shane's CD.
Well, High School Musical, the game, just came out in DS last week.
And it's coming out, the karaoke game's coming out on PlayStation 2 and Wii in November.
All I have to do is go to Disneyland and then run away from them while they chase me.
So, Footy Monster, I'm just shocked.
A very unlikely recommendation for Hannah Montana.
But you know what?
I guess this will truly put people to the test.
Is a good game.
Is a good game a good game a good game no matter what?
And if you remember though, they do have that special Disney like Xbox Live type service that's starting with the Hannah Montana 2 game too.
I just posted the link to the story and the video in chat.
So just check it out for yourselves.
I mean really, it's like I can tell you Hannah Montana seems to be a good game and you're probably going to laugh at me.
But once you see that, actually look at people's reactions in the chat room.
I can't believe that he's right.
It looks to be pretty cool.
The fact that you can actually jam like it was Rock Band.
It's like people said it's jam sessions for the DS mixed with Rock Band with a crap IP.
Then how the fuck did Hannah Montana get her name on this?
That's what I want to know.
I'm looking at this right now.
So wait, I'm going to play this little video here just because I can.
This is coming from DSFanboy.
This is my cameraman.
So where's this video?
Oh, it's going to stream a lot here.
Let me take a little bit.
This is not going to be good.
It's a kind of slow video.
I don't know why the person doesn't really show the game screen that much.
They show the guy talking.
Yeah, I know.
I don't want to see the dude talking.
I just want to see the screen.
But they show the screen a couple of times and you can get the feel of the game.
You can record up to two minutes, even if you're playing Wi-Fi, so you can actually record two minutes of something.
if you're recording with your buddies, and that kind of thing.
So it seems to be pretty feature complete, which is kind of impressive.
Son of Dad says, the license kills this game.
No hardcore gamer will buy this.
I will buy it.
Oh, you dare to defy.
Well, here's the best part, though.
Sorry, go ahead.
I was going to say, if it's a game like this where, you know, it's not going to be that popular, it means it'll just be in a bargain bin pretty quick, and then you can pick it up.
But it might be popular because of the fact that, oh, he's like strumming the little guitar with the DS thing.
Yeah.
It's kind of... Very interesting.
Talk about gaming gems in the strangest places.
I mean, wow, there's like little drums, too.
That is something else.
I might have to check that out.
Real quickly before we let you go, I know you also co-host a podcast about strictly role-playing games, right?
That is correct.
Am I allowed to plug it?
Yes, you may plug it.
It's The Ultimate Quest.
You can find it on ultimatequest.net.
The next show is probably going to be released in the next few days, so yeah, there you go.
Well, what I want to ask you about Ultimate Quest, I know Blue Dragon is coming out very soon.
Are you excited about this?
Because it's been getting some mixed reception from people.
I would be excited about it if it wasn't for two reasons.
First off, one of the other co-hosts on the show, Jack Ransom, Shadowslayer, better known, he actually played the demo and also did Xenocore, and they both agreed that it's...
Really nice looking.
It's something that the 360 doesn't really have in excess, which is like a traditional RPG.
But that's it.
So that the whole thing that they look really like little kids will put off any hardcore 360 game.
Anything that doesn't have a 360, so whatever.
Alright, we'll see.
Alright, anyway, we've had John for a long time, so we've got to let you go.
But thanks so much for the call and for the tip on Hannah Montana.
Who would have known?
Yeah, no worries.
I got to spread the Montana love.
That's all.
Take care.
Have a good flight.
I understand you have a 14-hour flight tomorrow, so have a good flight.
All right.
Thanks a lot, man.
All right.
Bye-bye.
See you.
See you.
He's breaking up a little bit there at the end, too, so it's probably for the best.
We'll take one more call.
One more call.
Why not?
If anybody else decides to call in.
1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number.
Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Waiting for it.
One more call.
Give it a second because of the buffer.
I'm trying to see what else is going on in chat here.
Let's see.
Joshi16 says he's pimping Montana out on the streets.
Footy is back in chat saying that game will rock everybody's socks.
Um...
Looks interesting, though.
They've got some good screenshots on IGN or something.
And it's got a little too much sparkles and pink for my taste, but I don't know.
I like that idea, though, that maybe the developers will release the game without the Hannah Montana IP, like it's a different game.
HitStun says, you could say the GBA Astro Boy was brought down a little by its license.
The original Astro Boy is hard to watch.
Talking about IPs.
All right, well, unfortunately, there's no other calls coming on the Skype line for right now.
and so we're going to go back to the news and just so you know the live listeners Live 365 may dump the show at any time unfortunately it will be inevitable we'll just have to keep going but we're going to keep recording tonight's show and of course you'll be able to hear the full thing and anything you might miss because of the Live 365 dump tonight you can certainly hear it on our podcast which you can download of course at
We would have done the mailbag segment right now, but unfortunately we didn't get a whole lot of emails.
But if you do want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelandradio.com.
If you wanted to maybe call in tonight and get the chance to, you could always send us an email.
And DarkSakura always reads through the emails.
But not this week.
Yes.
And let us know what you think about Hannah Montana, the game.
Especially because I know there's a lot of music gaming fans that listen to this program because of our history that we did obviously a lot with music games in the past.
This is a very interesting...
I think a lot of people have said in the past, you know, DDR is starting to look more and more like a game for little girls.
This doesn't help the music gaming genre break out of that stereotype.
All right, well, let's get back into some gaming news and talk about... We were talking a lot before we went to Skype about how Sony is kind of getting all these ideas from other places.
At least it seems like, it feels like, and this story certainly doesn't help.
You remember Africa and...
The game we saw at E3, what, a couple years ago?
That, like, everybody looked at it going, what the fuck is that?
Well, we still don't know what the fuck that is.
Is it Jamba Safari?
If so, that's fucking rad.
A harpoon, me and Gazelle.
But apparently the developer said you do not get to attack the animals in Africa.
Otherwise, they have said nothing about the game.
But there are rumors.
Again, I must stress rumors because I think this sounds like a load of crap.
But the rumor is going out saying...
Sony is supposedly going to be releasing a Wii Fit type touchpad to go with Africa to make the Safari experience complete.
Now my question is, how in the fuck does that work?
Do you stand on it and then it just like shakes?
It's Rhinoceros' approach?
That makes no sense to me whatsoever.
That's why I think this was totally pulled out of somebody's butt.
The other thing, too, that's also suggesting that Africa is going to be out in, like, January.
So, I don't think so, since we haven't heard anything about it.
And it's Africa.
Well, could they delay it to maybe add something in?
I mean, who knows?
Well, it wouldn't be out before the Wii Fit, then, now would it?
All right.
Well, this kind of was an interesting story, but I do take it with a huge grain of salt.
Yeah.
Um.
Something else that's interesting, part of EA's plan to totally dominate everything that exists in the world, they are now partnering up with Hasbro to release games based on their favorite properties, including Monopoly, Risk, and Scrabble, as well as toys including GI Joe, Tonka, Nerf, and Littlest Pet Shop.
They're still doing Littlest Pet Shop?
I didn't even realize there was a Littlest Pet Shop.
Um...
Yay?
I don't know, Nerf would be kind of neat.
Like a first person shooter Nerf game.
I think they actually have had that before.
I'd put that in the category of good for them.
I wonder if this means Monopoly on Xbox Live Arcade.
Because that's what we really need.
That and Scrabble.
No, because then people will never stop playing because a Monopoly game on average takes about six hours.
Awesome.
Well, at least you can't have someone cheat as the banker.
Speaking of online games though, Park Associates, who is big for running those studies on online activities, said that there are 34% of adult users on the internet playing games as compared to 29% on YouTube and 19% on MySpace and Facebook.
So they have shown a 79% growth in online gaming over the year and only 46% in social networking.
So we likes our games.
Keep them going.
And on top of that, though, I've noticed a lot of online games have that social aspect already combined with it.
Because I'll tell you half the reason I used to play Ragnarok Online.
I totally believe that casual games are as big as sometimes the hardcore gamers forget to admit.
You know, because again, I use the example of walking around in the workplace and looking at little cubicles and so many people playing those freaking, you know, PopCap games like Collapse and what have you, you know, like it's an incredible business.
They're not supposed to be doing that at work.
Well, they do.
They can do it on their breaks.
Wink, wink.
Not on our breaks at my work.
Oh, that's too bad.
We get stabbed in the head.
Really?
Yeah, really.
That sucks.
It's an HR issue.
Alright, anyway, this might be a future HR issue if you're caught playing this game at work.
It's Super Chick Sisters!
You might have heard of this game this week.
It's from PETA.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released this game called Super Chick Sisters as part of their website, KentuckyFriedCruelty.com.
I played the game, and you know what?
I've got to tell you, it's not bad.
For a little homebrew cook-up title, it's not bad.
And it's very tongue-in-cheek.
It's obvious that the people who made the game know a little something about video games.
Because, like, okay, basically here it is.
The premise of the video game, it's kind of like a Mario Brothers rip-off, but instead of Mario Brothers, you have a little chicken.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and Mario and Luigi are suffering from a case of Wii-itis.
They've been playing too much Nintendo Wii, so their hands are broken.
So they can't go rescue, so they have to rely on Chick and Nugget.
So you go through these Mario-type levels.
Instead of collecting coins, you collect these little birds, and then they give you little facts.
Did you play it?
I wish.
I did play it.
And I wish more of my, like, Mario Brothers games would have that.
Hey, did you know that they chop the beaks off of chickens and don't even do anything?
It's like, and did you realize that they boil them alive?
That's so horrible.
Did you know that they put chickens in the incinerator and boil them?
I mean, I was just like, this is amazing.
I mean, I'm kind of, like, parking news, KFC tortures chickens.
Part of me wants to invite PETA on this show, even though they are such a controversial organization.
But part of me goes like, why did you do this?
Like, why did you make a game out of this?
You do realize there are copyright laws out there?
I mean, there's like, they weren't at all like trying to say, oh, yeah, it's Larry and, you know.
and Barry or something.
It's Mario and Luigi and they have Toad in there and they use the Wii and they're not afraid about that.
In fact, at one point Mario gets beat up for being cruel to turtles.
Oh my god, you played to level 3 to get that message, I know.
Yeah, level 3 was Mario gets beat up by the people for ethical treatment of turtles or something like that.
I mean, it's very tongue-in-cheek but it's funny and it's, you know, whether you agree or disagree with PETA
It's kind of an interesting way to get their message across.
The thing I would want to ask PETA, and I swear I'm going to send them an email this week and try to get them on the show.
I want to know, why did they choose to make a game out of this to get their message?
Is it because they want to get to that stereotype World of Warcraft player who's doing an all-night raid with a bucket of wings in his lap?
Are they trying to get those guys to think twice?
That game made me hungry.
I've got a $5 gift certificate to KFC.
I'm thinking about...
Using me to get me some chicken.
Stop.
Even if you read all about the torturous ways of... This is kind of funny.
I'm kind of digging this game.
It's interesting, isn't it?
I'm big already.
Alright, so...
DarkTetsuyu in chat says, Nintendo will sue.
Frisbee says, this makes me want KFC even more.
Joshi16 says, but if it's for a good cause, they don't have to care about laws and restrictions.
Just look at gross anti-smoking commercials.
But my question is, you know, PIPEDA is a very controversial organization.
There's a lot of
And they may not want, yeah, they may not want their, especially, I don't think they gave, obviously they did not give them permission, you know, for this stuff.
It's sort of like, what's the business, is it Walmart that doesn't allow anybody out front of their store?
No, it's Target.
Target does not allow anybody out front of their store, no matter who they are.
I mean, it could be Girl Scouts or anything, they do not allow anybody out front of their store.
It's just to be consistent policy.
You know, they don't want their name tied to any, you know, Republican, Democrat initiative or whatever it is.
So, I think it's Target.
I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but...
I sure as hell know it's not Walmart.
Maybe Nintendo wants to be like that where they don't want to be tied to any organization and I somehow doubt they were asked about this.
WonderDogHerald says PETA, as usual, likes to appeal to children for their tactics.
People eating tasty animals.
You guys keep saying stuff like that.
They're not going to want to come on the show.
I like chicken.
I didn't get the whole pipe level.
That frustrated me and I turned it off.
Yeah, level 3 was... I stopped at level 3 too.
It was too hard to figure out.
A little over the top.
Someone needs some better level design.
Again, for a homebrew game, which essentially it is, it's not bad.
I mean, it's obvious a lot of effort went into this.
It wasn't... That's what surprised me most about it is that it wasn't cheaply put together.
The Colonel with the Spider-Robot
Anyways, Ubisoft is now talking about a brand new top secret game that they have in development that's going to be focusing on user-generated content.
I guess you could kind of compare it to LittleBigPlanet or something of that sort.
Anyways, it will allow gamers to support their creations across platforms, sending out pie-in-the-sky meters, or apparently, according to Joyce, it's sending their pie-in-the-sky meters off the charts, but...
I don't know.
Great.
I think a lot more companies are going to start taking this stance and allowing more user created content instead of banning that.
Look at Forza 2 with the whole creating cars.
Halo 3 with the new videos that they're uploading.
Hell, even before that with Burnout.
Revenge where you can upload your gameplay footage and stuff.
SingStar where you're going to be able to do the same thing.
Something that we're probably going to see more of.
All right.
Well, DarkSakura likes to surf the Internet up and down every single week and choose a website of her liking to share with all of you.
And we call it her website of the week.
And I'm curious what DarkSakura has picked out for the kids this week.
Let's play the music and see.
The website of the week is PETAKillsAnimals.com.
What, Rob?
Oh boy, there went our chances of getting PETA on the show.
It's basically... Actually, their most recent news were about the recent PETA trial in North Carolina for animal cruelty.
Basically, they had to submit the numbers of the amount of animals that they had actually killed involved in their research.
They have, on their...
I remembered some of this from being on Penn & Teller's Bullshit recently.
Great show, by the way.
Where one of the charges on their inventories was for a walk-in freezer that cost $9,370.
What about Vegetables?
Well, no.
That's a lot of frozen peas.
But there was just quite a bit on here about exactly what they spelled.
The head of PETA is actually on, you know how they say, oh, well, don't use this medication because it was tested on animals?
The head of PETA is actually on insulin that was, the research was done on animal testing and derived from animal products.
I just thought it was very interesting.
Pretty much a company run by hypocrites, but well.
Well, I guess we always have to have a counterpoint to every point made on the show, so there you have it.
All right, anyhow, let's talk a little bit about Squeenix.
We love Square Enix, and they are opening their brand new store online on August 20th, and they even have a time, 6 p.m.
Pacific time.
There's going to be a brand new online shop opening up and it's supposed to have Square Enix collectibles, model kits, and clothing accessories.
And I wonder if that means buttons or if you'll be able to buy full cosplay on the website.
That would be pretty awesome.
Probably some of those Final Fantasy XII action figures like the Balthier one, which I have.
Because Balthier is very awesome in Final Fantasy XII.
So if you're a Square Enix fan, I'm sure you're going to be hitting up their website on August 20, 2007.
Unfortunately, I don't recall exactly where the website is located, but I'm sure if you go to Square Enix's website at squareenix.com, there'll be a link right there when the store opens.
So be on the lookout for it.
Well, if in case you're wondering...
What those large hard drives are for on the PlayStation 3?
Well, wonder no more.
Actually, they are going to be releasing a digital tuner for recording TV.
And it's supposed to be unveiled at LibZig here pretty soon.
So this has been confirmed by 3Speech, their semi-official blog for Sony.
All right.
Well...
In other news, they are talking about the chip manufacturers that are behind the Wii shortage.
Nintendo wants to up production from what I'm understanding, but they are not able to get the chips they need still.
The ones who are making the components are saying that if it keeps up like that, they're not going to be able to keep up with the demand.
I'm not surprised.
All right.
Well, talking about electronic arts for a minute, going on over to Macintosh Gaming.
You know, Mac sometimes gets a bad rap because they don't really have a lot of games on it.
But you might have heard early in the year, EA is supposed to be, you know, kind of helping out a little bit more.
And EA has actually shipped four games for the Macintosh.
They've shipped Battlefield 2142, Need for Speed Carbon, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and Command & Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars.
So for those of you saying there are no games available on the Mac, well, there's four pretty big titles right there, especially Command & Conquer 3.
A lot of people love their Command & Conquer games.
So there you have it.
In fact, I got a message earlier this week online asking if I played Command & Conquer, if I wanted to play, and I said, no, you'd have to ask Loki, because I don't really play that.
I don't have Command & Conquer 3, so there you have it.
I used to play it, though.
Anyways, let's see.
I was going to say, there's been some interesting stuff going on in the whole EA Wikipedia article there.
Apparently, some EA staffers have been changing a little bit of history on there, removing key facts.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
EA did come out and say they sometimes update websites with info about company, games, and employees.
For example, EA has sent a correction to Yahoo Finance when they had misspelled the name of an EA executive.
Many companies routinely post updates on websites like Wikipedia to ensure accuracy of their own corporate information.
However, I think deleting information that is negative about your company's past is not exactly, I don't know, following that.
It's basically just... Poor ethics.
Yeah, it's hiding the bad spots.
Like, Wikipedia doesn't allow you to edit an article that's up about yourself, right?
Yeah, in fact, that is a major violation...
Yeah.
Like, for instance, I don't touch the OLR article.
I mean, there is an Orange Lounge Radio article on Wikipedia how it survived this long against their, you know...
Notability Rules, I have no idea, but hey, it's there.
Probably because, I guess, since we were lucky enough to have the news articles, then there's been other sources about us, but whatever.
I've never touched the article, although I'm always fascinated reading the updates and the work that other people have put into it.
But I just won't touch it because I'm like, well, that's kind of weird.
There's things I want to go fix in it, like some of the shows that aren't on anymore.
I've fixed grammatical errors.
Did you?
Yes, I have.
Well, I guess that's different.
Grammatical errors is one thing, but I don't touch it because, I don't know, it's weird.
Some folks in chat are saying, you're welcome, you're welcome.
Joshi16 says, Wikipedia is becoming corporate propaganda machine.
Interesting.
interesting perspective you know that's not the only Wikipedia thing I read about this week I heard that the was it the ESA supposedly was going on to Wikipedia and had edited some articles on like Abandonware and stuff too and they were deleting things like there's some IPs traced back I want to say I read something about that I think I remember that too yeah so kind of interesting all this Wikipedia information that's come out this week I think ours needs a bit of an update I was just looking at it yeah it probably needs a small update but I don't want to do it myself so maybe a kind listener will go in there and clean it up we'll see
Anyways, let's see.
Well, actually, I had a little bit of news in regards to stuff coming out on the Virtual Console and the PSP.
Sure.
There is actually a Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest.
It has actually been rated for a Wii release.
And LucasArts is bringing out Indiana Jones to the PSP, tentatively titled as Indiana Jones 2008.
But it's not Lego.
Dude, I wonder if it's based on the old Indiana Jones arcade game.
That game was pretty awesome.
Well, they did have, was it that Indiana Jones game that was being worked on by LucasArts?
The one that was supposed to be all, you know... That was the Indiana Jones 2008.
Yeah, but still, this could be something like that.
Or maybe tying in with the new Indiana Jones movie.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Harrison Ford is too old.
He's never too old.
They'll make him a robot.
Well, I guess if Bruce Willis can do it, Harrison Ford can.
Dementium, The War Dementium
and I guess it's actually based off an independent title by Renegade Kid.
And Dementium is a mature rated game and it looks like it's going to be kind of like that type Silent Hill horror type game.
I was actually thinking of the Call of Cthulhu game.
Well, remember they have that one was a Touch the Dead a while back that was also a mature rated title that was more of a shooter, but...
I think around the same site, Insecticides was coming out on the DS as well, so that one was pretty cool.
That was that adventure game that was kind of film noir, but with insects.
We don't see a lot of survival horror on the DS, so kind of interesting.
It looks good.
I haven't seen too much on this game, but I'm always interested in more survival horror games, because they always succeed in scaring the pants off of me.
So, there you have it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
until we get booted.
I don't know if any more calls will come in, but we'll see.
Okay.
I've got some last-minute stories.
Ninja Gaiden 2 is going to be debuting on the Xbox 360, and with PlayStation 3 coming later on, it's supposed to debut at Tokyo Game Show.
That is the rumor coming from GameSpot Korea.
So it'll be interesting to check that out.
Let's see here.
Halo 3, of course, nearing completion, almost gold right now.
And there's been some interesting details on this new Bungie Pro program that's going to be happening.
And basically what Bungie Pro is, is it's going to be a... Anyone that has a copy of Halo 3 and a gold subscription will be allocated six slots...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DecaSporta Volleyball
Let's see what else here.
Halo the movie has been apparently reconfirmed that it's coming and is apparently already filming in New Zealand.
Bullshit.
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.
This is coming from XboxFamily.com.
So I don't believe it, but we'll see.
That it?
There's one other thing.
I heard some interesting stuff this week.
A game I did not realize was coming out this fall.
Apparently, was it...
Kingdom of Fire, Circle of Doom is supposed to be coming out in early December.
I thought that was coming out in 2008.
Speaking of upcoming games, what have you heard about Two Worlds?
RAD RAD
And, you know, the day and night cycles are supposed to be pretty cool.
And, I don't know, it's kind of like Oblivion, but it's all third person.
And I don't really know much beyond that.
It looks cool, but I think, unfortunately, it's coming out the same week as Bioshock.
Well, it would have been.
It speaks to a different audience.
It originally was supposed to come out last week, which would have been perfect, because it's Madden and that.
You know, that would have been a pretty good game to pick up if you're not into Madden.
Star Parodia Star Soldier Star Parodia
Bioshock PC Demo
Thank you for watching!
Maybe I'll get Bioshock for the PC over the 360.
Who knows?
But then again, I want achievement points because I'm an achievement player.
I don't think it's going to run that well on PC.
At least not on our PCs.
Probably not on my PC.
That's true.
One other thing to speak about here.
Nintendo Power has apparently given Metroid Prime 3 a 10 out of 10.
Wow!
Really?
A Nintendo run magazine giving their game a 10 out of 10?
That's so surprising.
Now hold on because something that the story notes is that
You may or may not remember, but Ocarina of Time only got a 9.5 from Nintendo Power, so the fact they gave this a 10 out of 10 does make your eyebrow race a little bit.
Oh, wow, okay, so a 9.5, because that's really different than a 10.
It's almost perfect, but Metroid, that's perfect.
You know, really, do you think they would have to sell more of Ocarina of Time?
I mean, I think that game sells itself, whereas Metroid Prime, you know, maybe it needs a little help to be...
Selling some of those units.
And a lot of folks are giving Bioshock, of course, very high scores.
Joshi16 in chat is pointing out that Bioshock got a 10 out of 10 from the original Xbox magazine.
But is that really a shock?
Is it?
Who knows?
NintendoManiac64 says Ocarina of Time's negative .5 was from Navi.
Listen!
Listen!
Listen, goddammit, listen!
All right.
Well, that pretty much does it for all the stories tonight.
I don't really think we have anything else.
I opened up the Skype line and told the chat they could call in.
I'll give one more shout if you guys want to get through.
1-877, because I guess they're still live and still going.
1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
Call!
We'll see.
If not... Ah, there we go.
We're getting some calls now.
Just takes a little bit.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Legend of Saku.
Oh, see, because you missed the first wave.
What's on your mind, Saku?
I just came back from 8 on the break.
I had a little 2DX tournament today.
Managed to beat some chumps and, you know, distorted.
But yeah, Champions of the Coast wasn't so bad this weekend.
You were always going to some tournament on the East Coast, it seems like.
Actually, it was my first 2DX tournament.
Wow, well, how was the 2DX tournament set up?
Was it fun?
Yeah, it was pretty good.
I mean, there weren't, you know...
B-Mania 2DX Player
Of course, man.
But yeah.
But if there's anything that would make that whole weekend is just seeing a 2DX freestyle.
A 2DX freestyle?
Yes.
How did that work?
The break is the only place where you can freestyle any of their music or dancing machines.
Well, who did that and what did they do?
They did Tangerine Stream, some sort of homoerotic stuff.
No offense, but that's
Thank you for watching!
I don't know, I'm just thinking about a 360, but since, you know, the failure rate's too high, I don't know if Bioshock or anything like, you know, Halo 3 Gears of War would just be, would just outweigh all the risk in just buying a 360 in the first place.
Dude, you're the second caller tonight to tell us that the failure rate issues are making you contemplate the 360.
Dude.
That's making me nervous.
It's interesting.
And God forbid a PS3.
And I know I don't want to pick the latter.
So I don't really have that much of a choice right now.
Has a person who personally owns multiple Xbox 360 systems and has never had one crap out for heat issues... I don't know what the hell people are talking about.
I mean, seriously...
Okay, maybe you may have the unlikely situation where your system craps out.
Who gives a shit?
You have a fucking three-year warranty on the heat-related issues.
It gets replaced within a couple weeks.
That's the issue.
I don't get why Sony can make a PS3 that craps out at a blue moon and 360s is like what?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't want to play out the horror stories of having to go through 8, 10 consoles.
Just to get it right.
I mean, it's just retarded to just have to go through multiple consoles.
Hold on.
Shut up for a minute.
Not you, Zach, but Loki.
I did have an Xbox 360 that did crap out on me after four days, and I was so fucking pissed when it happened.
You remember on this program, I was...
Don't you fucking buy 360 because they'll fucking die on you, blah, blah, blah.
I was so pissed when it happened, but I'm over it.
I mean, they were quick.
They got the job done.
I mean, it didn't take two or three weeks.
I had it back in a week.
They paid for shipping?
Yeah, they paid for everything.
Do they pay for shipping?
They sent me a box.
They sent me a coffin to send it back in.
I heard they don't do that anymore.
I think they still do.
That's the thing.
Then I have to incur charges.
You're not going to incur any charges.
Then you're talking about like they're going to have to replace the system eight times.
If that were the case, they wouldn't be selling millions of fucking consoles.
This wouldn't be like a hot selling item.
You already have that happening to certain people.
Here's what the problem is.
You hear fucking idiots on the goddamn internet that bitch like fucking little babies about their fucking console breaking.
Everyone's like, oh my god, all of them are breaking all at once.
Don't give me that bullshit.
I have a migraine now.
Alright.
Okay, hold on.
Here's my other thought though, is that what about that the new Xbox 360s have like the new chips in them or whatever?
Well, that's yet to be seen.
I mean, if those break out less, you know, like, you know, once in a blue moon or very, very rare, then I'll hop on it, you know, at the drop of a hat.
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what, fine, you can go ahead and skip buying a 360.
I'll enjoy playing Bioshock.
You can go ahead and wait for the next big game to come out for the PlayStation 3.
I'm sure it'll be next year sometime.
I would say he could get it on PC, but he has a Mac, right?
I'm building a new PC anyway, so that's going to be happening in a few days once I start ordering the parts.
I've already set aside a good $1,500, $1,600 for.
The PC can hold me for now, and then hopefully by Christmas, once we know whether the new heatsinks will actually make a difference, then I'll think about it.
Well, the PC might hold you, but will it give it the reach around?
Oh.
I don't know.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
And on that note, look, Zaku, I appreciate the Springer-fied call this show got, but we appreciate the perspective.
Yes.
Sorry, Zaku.
Time's up.
Take care though.
Bye.
I can have new cars?
Seriously, people talking about fucking heat sinks and issues with a couple of... This is more than just Zaku, though.
This is your pent-up anger at all the internet blogs and people across the entire internet that have made people like Zaku.
I don't know what the fuck they want.
I mean, they've already made revisions to fix this problem.
They have a three-year fucking warranty on it.
What the hell more do you want?
I mean, if your Sony PlayStation 3 craps out on you, good luck getting it fixed.
Um...
Maybe it could, like, do my dishes, I don't know, it'd be pretty awesome.
I don't know, it's just, it's stupid, it really is.
Alright, another call, one more call, then this is it.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Hello, it's Paradox Vincent.
Hello, Paradox Vincent, what's on your mind?
Hey, long time no see, chat.
Not much, just calling in after a while, haven't been able to really listen to the show live, but...
Finally got to sit down and talk to you guys again.
Well, what's up?
Was there a story tonight you wanted to comment on?
I did play the Kentucky Fried Cruelty Chicken game.
It was pretty good.
It's definitely better than a lot of charity organizations putting up web games on there.
It was fun and stuff.
It was certainly better than most politically-oriented games, and even better than a lot of homebrew, which... Oh, I can't believe... I'm so sorry, ParadoxVincent.
I've got to go on a tangent for a minute.
I know, it's fine.
Did you hear about the homebrew that was on the DS that was like, avoid the gay mob, or whatever it is?
No.
You control the little character, and then if you get hit by the mob, it goes, oh, you got hit by a gay person, game over.
And it's huge.
It's been hitting all these websites.
because it's like, oh my gosh, homophobia in the homebrew scene.
Well, and I just kind of read it going, you know, well, there's idiots everywhere.
And the unfortunate thing is, is that when you give this guy attention, unfortunately, more people are going to seek this game out and play it.
Not just people who like, you know, gay guys who want to play it and laugh at it for being stupid, which, you know, I admit I was tempted to do, but I didn't.
But then you're also going to have people that inadvertently read about this through sites like, you know, MTV or whatever, that report on it going, you know,
Yeah, I do kind of, you know, I do hate gays.
I want to play this game and I want to find this guy who made this game and help him make a better game, you know, and just, I don't know.
I don't think we should give these kinds of things any attention whatsoever.
So maybe I shouldn't have said anything about it at all, but I just thought the whole thing was very interesting.
And the homebrew was really bad.
It's really bad.
Anyway, sorry, Paradox.
Really bad homebrew?
Yeah, it's really bad.
So, okay, back to the PETA game.
What do you think was their motivations for making it?
Um...
You know, it's either what you said in trying to kind of target the video game playing audience and tell them, hey, you know, Kentucky Fried Chicken is bad.
Or really, they could have just been seeking out a new media to get their message out and then they noticed that, you know, web games are pretty popular.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Why, why did they, I mean, if they chose to do this to do, to connect with a gaming audience, it kind of worked, didn't it?
Because, like, you know, all the major gaming blogs reported on it, and I probably would have never heard of this game had it not been posted, you know, like all these different blogs are on the internet.
So, in a way, it kind of worked, and it kind of did get their message out there, huh?
Here's the thing.
Real quick, sorry.
It got the attention because it's on all these game blogs.
You know they're going to get a cease and desist for this.
That's going to be even more attention for them.
I don't think they will.
I think they will.
All right, we'll see.
I wouldn't know.
All right.
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Paradox Vincent?
Yes, two things, and I'll try to get them done real quick.
Quick Guitar Hero 80s review.
Great song list.
I love almost every song in there.
and it gave me a couple new favorite songs, but they're just really kind of not great charts.
Especially the Turning Japanese chart was really boring, but I guess it's Activision's first real take at a music game, to my understanding, and hopefully they'll be getting better by the time Guitar Hero 3 comes out.
I mean, this is Harmonix's third game
Guitar Hero was, so they already knew what they were doing a lot.
And also, I don't know if anybody's heard, but there is a 2DX gold machine in Arizona right now as of probably about a month and a half ago, and it's at Mesa Golf Land, Sunsplash, and the one-player turntable right now, though, is broke or stolen or something, as I know.
I would have never guessed.
Yep.
Because Mesa Golf Land is just like Roseville Golf Land.
I mean, it's huge, and it has, like, the water park, if I remember right, and everything, so.
Yep.
Yep.
And they might be getting a poppin' music machine.
That would be cool.
Poppin' music's awesome.
They just said might.
I'm hoping they will, though.
So, that's really all.
All right.
Well, thanks so much for the call.
Appreciate it, Paradox Vincent.
You have a great week, okay?
All right.
You guys, too.
All right.
Later.
See you later.
Have lots of fun playing the 2DX Gold Machine, that's for sure.
You know what's funny, though, is I think the PD game worked in reverse for me, because I forgot about, you know, KFC.
You know, they kind of fell off my radar as far as food options.
I'm like, you know, hey, KFC sounds kind of good right now.
I was sort of thinking about getting fried chicken on the way home.
You guys.
I'm a southern girl.
I grew up on fried chicken and grits.
Here's one thing I do love about KFC.
Biscuits.
No, no, no, no.
Most of them have A&Ws attached to them.
Biscuits.
An A&W root beer is the bomb when it comes out of the tap.
Biscuits.
There was one time.
Biscuits and honey.
All right, biscuits.
We get it.
There was one time I passed it up, and I really wanted to do it.
They were selling root beer in gallon jugs, like the milk jugs.
They were.
I remember that.
That's good shit.
They were big things in their root beer right out of the tap.
Wow.
Wow.
and Julie and I got three of them and drank them in a night.
It was fantastic.
It was Diet Rebirth for them.
Quick comments from the recent phone call there.
We are still live.
It's been 25 minutes since the maintenance was supposed to start.
We're still up.
God damn life is screwing us all up.
Oh well.
Did they put any sort of retraction notices or anything?
I don't know.
I'm not even going to bother to look.
No, they were smart.
They would just say that they're taking the service offline for a while to protest the whole, you know, that law going into place even though they were doing maintenance.
Don't even get me started You know, I don't see anything about it Let me see
I'm going to check this out.
Meanwhile, RawSteelUT says, Rob, it didn't work.
We're still going to eat KFC.
I don't know, but if a couple people change their mind, maybe some people would tell you it was worth it.
And I showed it to another friend of mine, and another friend of mine played it and said, oh, wow, you know, I don't want KFC anymore.
The only thing I'm pissed off about KFC is they got rid of their chicken livers.
I used to love those things, and they used to have –
They used to have, I think, some sweet and sour sauce, and I think they got rid of that stuff, too.
I love their sweet and sour sauce.
Joshi16 says, I'm going to order fried chicken right now to protest.
I used to get their chicken livers all the time.
They came in a big bucket, and you'd get your gravy with it.
Oh, my God, that was so good.
You need to have the chicken livers at Roscoe's, though.
All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Loki, we'll start off with you tonight.
Your final thoughts.
I get some Bioshock next week and that makes me happy.
My final thought is ow, tooth, hurt, hate, dentist, cry.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
I fucking want some chicken liver right now.
Alright, thanks you guys for tuning in and listening to us tonight.
Thank you to all the live listeners and sorry the maintenance didn't happen when it was supposed to happen.
Very interesting.
No, I'm surprised that PETA hasn't shut down our peep jousting
tournaments that we do once in a while because, you know.
