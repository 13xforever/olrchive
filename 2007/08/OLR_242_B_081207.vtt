00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream

00:04.760 --> 00:05.760
twice weekly.

00:05.760 --> 00:12.240
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links

00:12.240 --> 00:15.480
to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.480 --> 00:19.960
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.960 --> 00:24.920
And welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 242, this part

00:24.920 --> 00:27.520
B on August 12th, 2007.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.960
Of course, we do tape live on Sunday nights at www.orangeloungeradio.com, and we have

00:30.960 --> 00:34.240
a chat room full of folks who are chatting about what we were talking about during the

00:34.240 --> 00:37.700
bonus segment, which is for the live-only folks, where we're talking about possibly

00:37.700 --> 00:42.080
creating a fighting game that would be like Capcom versus SNK, except it would be Orange

00:42.080 --> 00:46.140
Lounge Radio versus All Games Interactive, and I think the results there would be hilarious.

00:46.140 --> 00:50.460
So we'll have to talk more about that, maybe make a thread in the forums and see if All

00:50.460 --> 00:54.680
Games would want to get some of their talented artists and game designers in on it, too.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.760
Just do it in one of those, like, create-your-own-fighting-game programs.

00:56.760 --> 00:57.760
I think it would be hilarious.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.520
A lot of people would enjoy that.

00:59.520 --> 01:04.160
All right, and meanwhile, let's get back into the gaming news and talk about the real console

01:04.160 --> 01:07.560
gaming news out there, and I believe Loki's going to start us off this segment.

01:07.560 --> 01:12.960
Yes, apparently there's a rumor going around that Sony's going to acquire Rockstar Games,

01:12.960 --> 01:20.000
and I guess this would be good for Sony, since, you know, they need more first-party games,

01:20.000 --> 01:26.080
and definitely having the Grand Theft Auto franchise to themselves would be pretty good.

01:26.080 --> 01:30.240
Although, I don't know, apparently various sources of the press and, I guess, development

01:30.240 --> 01:36.080
team are saying that Sony is looking to take Rockstar under their wings, and I know that

01:36.080 --> 01:44.360
they have, was it LA Nor coming out for the PlayStation 3 exclusively in the spring, so

01:44.360 --> 01:45.360
I don't know.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.160
They're saying also, I guess, there's going to be another exclusive game afterwards, but

01:49.160 --> 01:56.000
I can't help but think there, you know, maybe some exclusive games for Sony, but I doubt

01:56.000 --> 01:59.680
that they're actually going to be bought up by Sony, because, I mean, they're making money

01:59.680 --> 02:05.200
hand over fist, so they'd be so stupid they cut out the Xbox 360.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.400
Doesn't it seem like this story is somewhat like jumping to conclusions?

02:08.400 --> 02:12.520
Like that's the feeling I got when I read it, is that, oh, well, Rockstar's been working

02:12.520 --> 02:18.300
a lot with Sony, and now they're doing this exclusive thing for Sony, so therefore Sony's

02:18.300 --> 02:19.640
going to be buying Rockstar.

02:19.640 --> 02:25.180
I don't think, I mean, think about it, I mean, why would they say, I mean, I guess if they're

02:25.180 --> 02:29.920
part of Sony, it doesn't matter that they're not selling as many units, but they're not

02:29.920 --> 02:35.600
exactly suffering or struggling financially, I think, I mean, granted, you know, Grand

02:35.600 --> 02:41.480
Theft Auto 4 being delayed is not helpful, or all the lawsuits, but shit, when that game

02:41.480 --> 02:47.340
comes out, they're not going to be struggling financially, so, some healthy skepticism courtesy

02:47.340 --> 02:48.660
of the chat room as well.

02:48.660 --> 02:52.080
Frisbee says, not going to happen without a big fight.

02:52.080 --> 02:56.320
Ross Steel UT says, Microsoft just paid them 50 million, it's not going to happen.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.320
Yeah.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.320
Perfect example.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.320
There you go.

02:59.320 --> 03:04.600
Well, one thing that can happen right now on your PSP is a brand new application called

03:04.600 --> 03:06.640
PSPTube.

03:06.640 --> 03:12.300
This is from a Japanese PSP homebrew developer, Sophia Cat, and basically what this does is

03:12.300 --> 03:16.880
it will let you watch YouTube videos on your PSP.

03:16.880 --> 03:21.480
Now, you don't have to convert the files or do whatever, you just basically play the videos

03:21.480 --> 03:23.340
directly from YouTube.

03:23.340 --> 03:24.560
Kind of cool there.

03:24.560 --> 03:29.000
Of course, you do have to go through some hoops and stuff to make it happen.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.280
If you want to check it out, you can visit the Sophia Cat site there and look at more

03:35.280 --> 03:39.800
information, but basically you have to make a developer ID and put it in this file and

03:39.800 --> 03:42.560
then it's kind of a bunch of crap you have to do.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.920
But they're going to, they also just released another new version of it that's supposed

03:45.920 --> 03:51.280
to have a favorites folder and stuff like that, that you can download videos and stuff

03:51.280 --> 03:52.280
from there.

03:52.280 --> 03:56.480
So, unlike, you know, sure you could do this probably through the web browser as well,

03:56.480 --> 03:59.900
but this is actually streaming videos straight off YouTube.

03:59.900 --> 04:04.760
This isn't just viewing them off of a web page or anything, so I guess it's a little

04:04.760 --> 04:05.760
bit better.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.600
SSJ100Matt has a good thought here.

04:07.600 --> 04:14.080
How long until PSPOrnotube, or PSPUporn, or PSPXTube, I mean it's just a matter of

04:14.080 --> 04:15.080
time, right?

04:15.080 --> 04:16.080
I hope.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.640
Because that's what people really want to do on their PSP.

04:17.640 --> 04:22.720
And they get the XXXBox thing coming out.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.000
Boo.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.240
I wanted another cookie, Rob.

04:25.240 --> 04:29.560
The brand new bad joke mistress of Orange Launch Radio, Dark Soccer.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.560
No, no, no.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.740
I was emulating Junami.

04:32.740 --> 04:40.240
I did buy that, I bought it in a 160 gig external hard drive, four videos on either the 360

04:40.240 --> 04:41.240
or PS3.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.040
All right, I will go get Jamie a cookie while she reads the next story.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.760
There's one cookie left.

04:46.760 --> 04:52.880
Well, for anybody who actually gives a crap about this game, and also since it's a UK

04:52.880 --> 05:02.080
release that I'm referring to, it was slipped during a press conference that, well, Activision

05:02.080 --> 05:07.800
UK is only confirming winter, however Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare has been given the

05:07.800 --> 05:15.160
date of November 9th for Europe on PS3, PC, and XBox 360.

05:15.160 --> 05:18.240
So you can have fun shooting down people if you want to.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.240
Enjoy.

05:19.240 --> 05:22.840
And I think that's about the same time as the one in the US is coming out, so it's not

05:22.840 --> 05:26.280
a huge surprise that they're releasing around that same time.

05:26.280 --> 05:29.360
Obviously, extremely awesome game.

05:29.360 --> 05:37.480
I mean, the video that they've been showing so far, very early, but very fucking awesome.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.080
Such a kind of game.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.720
I think so.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.640
The other thing that's kind of interesting, there's a whole PlayStation starter pack that

05:44.640 --> 05:47.680
was going on in the UK.

05:47.680 --> 05:52.940
Apparently it was one where they were actually offering the 60 gig system with Resistance

05:52.940 --> 05:57.120
and Motorstorm and two controllers for a set amount.

05:57.120 --> 06:03.560
Now the problem is that there's conflicting sources saying that the starter pack might

06:03.560 --> 06:10.040
actually be in jeopardy, that they might be done with it in August 31st.

06:10.040 --> 06:16.920
So much like the limited price point drop for the 60 gig system, and that makes sense

06:16.920 --> 06:22.320
if it has a 60 gig system in there, and if they're phasing out the 60 gig, then yeah,

06:22.320 --> 06:23.920
of course it's going to be in jeopardy.

06:23.920 --> 06:28.280
So if you want one, better buy it now.

06:28.280 --> 06:34.440
Alright, well of course PAL is the international format, or the format overseas in the Europe

06:34.440 --> 06:39.280
region for video games and for television signals, and speaking of things that have

06:39.280 --> 06:45.220
been going on overseas as far as video games go, Manhunt 2 of course, lots and lots and

06:45.220 --> 06:49.320
lots of stories hitting the internet when the British Board of Film Classification effectively

06:49.320 --> 06:51.360
banned Manhunt 2.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.800
Something to be considered this week is that Rockstar Games is currently appealing the

06:54.800 --> 07:02.480
decision, and there was actually an associate at game specialist law firm Osborne Clark

07:02.480 --> 07:06.600
said something about how it may be a while before this decision has the possibility to

07:06.600 --> 07:07.600
be overturned.

07:07.600 --> 07:12.480
Quote, last time this happened with Carmageddon, the appeal worked so that's a positive precedent.

07:12.480 --> 07:16.360
Rockstar has taken a while to build its case, so they've obviously been taking stock of

07:16.360 --> 07:17.720
what the BBFC have said.

07:17.720 --> 07:21.320
They'll have to work together to agree on making the right cuts.

07:21.320 --> 07:28.680
So it is possible that the BBFC could reconsider, but we won't find out for quite a long time.

07:28.680 --> 07:32.140
Also something to think about is that quote, if the BBC feels that the violence running

07:32.140 --> 07:35.320
throughout the game is too much, it's not like a film where you can just cut out certain

07:35.320 --> 07:39.800
scenes as of course a lot of people said when the story first hit the internet, when the

07:39.800 --> 07:41.880
game was first banned.

07:41.880 --> 07:42.880
No I'm really disappointed.

07:42.880 --> 07:48.480
I can understand why they would want to censor it and stuff so that it can be released on

07:48.480 --> 07:53.080
all the consoles, but I really wish they would kind of open the console format so that you

07:53.080 --> 08:00.600
can have, you know, what would be the equivalent of an NC-17 game, you know, where it's the

08:00.600 --> 08:05.360
uncut version where you can kill the strippers, fuck them, and then kill them again.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.200
You know, just something like that.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.200
I wish all this talk would just...

08:08.200 --> 08:11.360
Can that be the other way around?

08:11.360 --> 08:14.680
I just wish all this talk would go away and I wish they could just release the damn thing

08:14.680 --> 08:18.980
with an adults only rating and that everybody didn't have a collective thumb up their butt

08:18.980 --> 08:23.320
about how, you know, having adults only games on their platforms are going to corrupt children

08:23.320 --> 08:26.920
across America, you know.

08:26.920 --> 08:32.200
Sony needs to go and say, hey, we'll accept adult only games, go ahead and bring it out

08:32.200 --> 08:36.360
on the Playstation 2 and PS3 exclusively.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.360
There you go.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.440
A little bit of an edge for them.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.320
Alright, well, we shall see what happens.

08:41.320 --> 08:45.360
I'm sure this won't be the last time you hear about Manhunt 2, like it or not.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.960
Well, this is actually pretty cool.

08:47.960 --> 08:57.560
A business called Omega Sector opened in Birmingham, of course, in Europe.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.560
Not the Birmingham in Alabama?

08:58.560 --> 08:59.560
No.

08:59.560 --> 09:00.560
But I've been there.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.560
Okay.

09:01.560 --> 09:02.560
I've been there lots of times.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.560
It's not fun.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.200
Sorry, people in Alabama.

09:05.200 --> 09:11.880
But this is a place that has 400 custom built PCs.

09:11.880 --> 09:18.640
It's 22,000 square feet, two floors, it has an internet cafe, movies, a room for Xbox

09:18.640 --> 09:27.560
360 gaming, sponsored by Squeenix, THQ, Activision, and they've all got their own little places

09:27.560 --> 09:28.560
to play at.

09:28.560 --> 09:36.880
You can play Final Fantasy XI, Call of Duty, Shadow of Chernobyl, Stalker, and it's just

09:36.880 --> 09:44.400
a big, massive gaming spot, and so it's open for business.

09:44.400 --> 09:49.360
Someday when I become rich, I will open something like that and call it the Orange Lounge, but

09:49.360 --> 09:50.360
that's pretty cool, though.

09:50.360 --> 09:56.760
Well, there's two mobile Omega Sectors that will come and do parties and concerts and

09:56.760 --> 10:00.760
things like that, but this is kind of cool.

10:00.760 --> 10:06.160
You pay five pounds to get in, and then you can go around.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.400
There's promo stuff everywhere.

10:09.400 --> 10:13.320
You can basically not just go into play.

10:13.320 --> 10:19.560
You've got stuff for actually interacting with people, so that's kind of cool.

10:19.560 --> 10:23.140
We need one next door.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.140
In the backyard.

10:24.140 --> 10:25.840
Yes, in the backyard.

10:25.840 --> 10:29.000
Now I do have that shed I'm not really using for anything else, so let's install one of

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
these in there.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.400
Even though there's no air conditioning in there, we'd probably melt.

10:35.400 --> 10:42.920
You know, there's some interesting news coming out about a violent game law in California

10:42.920 --> 10:48.120
that would have restricted anyone from, under the age of 18, from buying or renting violent

10:48.120 --> 10:50.440
video games.

10:50.440 --> 10:54.640
I didn't even know that was in the works, which is interesting.

10:54.640 --> 10:56.720
Well, I'm sure we talked about it previously on the show.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.720
I know we did.

10:57.720 --> 11:01.600
Well, there's been so many states, you know, I just can't keep track of them.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
True.

11:02.600 --> 11:13.400
Anyways, so the bill signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger back in 2005, it's been overturned,

11:13.400 --> 11:17.840
so that's interesting because of course it was unconstitutional, yada, yada, yada, pretty

11:17.840 --> 11:22.040
much the same thing that every single state so far has found out.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.760
You know, it was a while ago when this happened.

11:23.760 --> 11:27.480
I think this was back when we were doing the to-go show, we were doing the separate shows,

11:27.480 --> 11:28.480
when this first went through.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.060
I think that's why you forgot about it, because I remember that guy, Leland Yee, they were

11:31.060 --> 11:35.960
parading him amongst all the game blogs and some of the shows on TV and how he wrote this

11:35.960 --> 11:40.360
bill and everything, and to his credit, even if we may not agree with his law personally,

11:40.360 --> 11:45.040
he was at least willing to chat with the game sites and the blogs and stuff.

11:45.040 --> 11:49.320
Yeah, and the thing and problem is it said violent video games, and of course, you know,

11:49.320 --> 11:50.320
what is violent?

11:50.320 --> 11:51.920
You know, that's the problem.

11:51.920 --> 11:57.600
It wasn't like adult-only games or mature-rated games cannot be sold to these people.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.600
That's right.

11:58.600 --> 12:02.820
You know, if they had done something like that, then that would have been a little different.

12:02.820 --> 12:03.820
I don't know.

12:03.820 --> 12:07.360
I think it's stupid that they're having laws for that since they don't have laws for that

12:07.360 --> 12:11.680
for movies or music or anything like that.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.980
So what happens now?

12:12.980 --> 12:13.980
Is it gone forever?

12:13.980 --> 12:14.980
Is it going to go away?

12:14.980 --> 12:15.980
No, of course not.

12:15.980 --> 12:16.980
Never hear about it again?

12:16.980 --> 12:21.520
Of course not, because you know, when it was been deemed unconstitutional, Governor Schwarzenegger

12:21.520 --> 12:26.760
says, well, it will be back, you know, pun intended, of course.

12:26.760 --> 12:33.460
And he says he isn't done protecting the bill's targeted youth.

12:33.460 --> 12:38.360
Thank you, Schwarzenegger, for saving our kids with censorship.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.400
Thank you very much.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.400
Especially since...

12:41.400 --> 12:45.340
Yeah, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Schwarzenegger like, you know, not only star

12:45.340 --> 12:49.640
in but give some money to the Terminator 3 project, which was an R-rated movie that I'm

12:49.640 --> 12:52.620
sure many kids snuck into, I mean, hello?

12:52.620 --> 12:57.160
Or Terminator 2, or Total Recall, I mean, the chick had three boobs, I mean, what kid

12:57.160 --> 12:59.720
is not going to, you know, try to sneak into a movie like that?

12:59.720 --> 13:00.720
I mean, come on.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.240
Where a chick has three boobs?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.240
Exactly.

13:03.240 --> 13:10.060
All right, well, anyhow, you know, news of these laws not going away and just the fact

13:10.060 --> 13:13.080
that here we go again makes us very angsty.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.260
So of course you know what that means.

13:15.260 --> 13:18.720
It's time to make our own violence here on the program with our segment called The F-You's

13:18.720 --> 13:19.720
of the Week.

13:19.720 --> 13:32.540
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

13:32.540 --> 13:39.000
My F-You of the Week goes towards people who don't know when to shut up.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.320
People who have to get the last word, who must always be right.

13:44.320 --> 13:54.160
People who don't understand when it's better to let things lie than to prolong a bad situation.

13:54.160 --> 13:58.320
F-You to that.

13:58.320 --> 14:04.800
Loki, all right, my F-You goes to this chair that I'm sitting in because it's horribly

14:04.800 --> 14:06.920
uncomfortable.

14:06.920 --> 14:12.560
It's hard, the back of it's like super stiff, like I feel like my spine is being readjusted.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.000
Not good.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.400
And then also F-You to my computer for resetting.

14:17.400 --> 14:21.640
I reinstalled Windows with Service Pack 2 now.

14:21.640 --> 14:26.540
Not only is my internet slower thanks to that, but I did kind of try to fix that.

14:26.540 --> 14:28.000
It's still resetting randomly.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.200
I just think the motherboard's crapping out.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.680
It's kind of old, so.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.760
Need to build a new computer.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.600
That's it.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.800
My F-You of the Week goes to Comcast for reasons previously mentioned.

14:40.800 --> 14:44.080
I mean, just the fact that they completely were fucking up our order made us wait so

14:44.080 --> 14:48.460
long to get the freaking internet here, and then we were sitting around the whole day

14:48.460 --> 14:53.720
and offered practically no compensation for it, so they suck big floppy donkey dick, so

14:53.720 --> 14:54.720
that's it.

14:54.720 --> 14:58.120
Wow, that was short F-Yous tonight.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.360
I'm quite impressed.

15:01.360 --> 15:05.920
Going from something F-You to something that makes me very, very happy is news on Spore.

15:05.920 --> 15:09.900
Of course, I'm very excited about Spore, and a lot of us have thought, ah, Spore is pretty

15:09.900 --> 15:13.560
much going away for a little while because the damn game's not supposed to come out till,

15:13.560 --> 15:16.280
what, like 2009 now at this point?

15:16.280 --> 15:23.240
Well, Spore didn't show up at E3, but Spore will be showing up at the Leipzig Convention

15:23.240 --> 15:24.840
in Germany.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.480
It's going to be actually playable behind closed doors.

15:28.480 --> 15:32.240
Now, of course, I wonder if that means, okay, is it like last year's E3 where it's going

15:32.240 --> 15:38.200
to be playable by somebody else, or will select lucky few people actually get to play it?

15:38.200 --> 15:44.160
Supposedly Spore is still on track for a 2008 release, but I think most people would agree

15:44.160 --> 15:47.080
they will release it when it's damn good and ready, and they're going to take their sweet

15:47.080 --> 15:48.960
ass time to make sure it's right.

15:48.960 --> 15:49.960
So let's hope so.

15:49.960 --> 15:55.000
Let's hope it's right, but keep your eye on your favorite game blogs from August 23rd

15:55.000 --> 15:58.880
to 26th when the Leipzig Games Convention's going on, because that's when you're likely

15:58.880 --> 15:59.960
to see some news on this.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.760
You see really what's happening, though, is the game is done.

16:02.760 --> 16:07.400
Right now they're just working on emptying Scrooge McDuck's vault so they can stick all

16:07.400 --> 16:11.840
the money in there that they're going to make on this game.

16:11.840 --> 16:12.840
That's what they're doing.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.920
Are they going to go swimming in it?

16:15.920 --> 16:17.320
And they will go swimming in it.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.320
What?

16:18.320 --> 16:20.500
They're going to make tons of money off this thing.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.500
That's what it is.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.960
Stop fucking making playable demos.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.960
I mean, that's all they're working on is goddamn playable demos for these stupid events.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.760
Just finish the fucking game.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.560
They're just trying to tease you.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.560
Then you'll make the money to go in the vault.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.560
They want you teased.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.760
Then you'll be able to swim in it.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.560
I just think it's very random that you brought up Scrooge McDuck's vault.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.400
I think that that's appropriate.

16:41.400 --> 16:47.900
By the way, dear Capcom, Capcom, yeah, where the fuck is DuckTales 3?

16:47.900 --> 16:49.080
Why didn't we ever get that?

16:49.080 --> 16:50.960
Maybe because DuckTales is off the air?

16:50.960 --> 16:51.960
Who cares?

16:51.960 --> 16:52.960
Who cares?

16:52.960 --> 16:53.960
No, no, no, no.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.320
It's all about the DuckTales moon level.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.320
I know, for real.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.320
The best music ever.

16:58.320 --> 17:03.080
DuckTales, what kid that grew up in the 80s doesn't remember the DuckTales video game?

17:03.080 --> 17:06.760
DuckTales 2, who cares that it didn't sell at all because it was released towards the

17:06.760 --> 17:08.520
end of the NES lifespan.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.440
Every kid upgraded to a Super Nintendo at that point.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.920
So where is DuckTales 3?

17:13.920 --> 17:15.480
Couldn't it be done on the DS?

17:15.480 --> 17:16.480
What?

17:16.480 --> 17:19.680
Did Capcom release the license or something?

17:19.680 --> 17:21.800
It's not on the air anymore.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.480
They're hanging out with Duke Nukem.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.580
Who cares?

17:24.580 --> 17:25.580
Look at Kingdom Hearts.

17:25.580 --> 17:28.200
Scrooge McDuck's in Kingdom Hearts and so is Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.160
But that's also got a lot of the more modern.

17:31.160 --> 17:35.480
The Tron is in Kingdom Hearts 2, which makes me happy.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.960
But you remember, though, those characters were not only on DuckTales.

17:38.960 --> 17:43.120
They actually existed in other cartoon shorts before DuckTales.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.840
Okay, I don't really give a shit who makes the DuckTales game.

17:45.840 --> 17:48.160
I just want one and I want it to not suck.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.160
Make it yourself.

17:49.160 --> 17:54.280
They can maybe do a DuckTales level in Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a Darkwing Duck level.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.280
Yeah, Darkwing Duck.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.560
Supposedly, Kingdom Hearts 3 is not Kingdom Hearts 3.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.160
Okay, Kingdom Hearts 3.5.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.400
Kingdom Hearts 2 is another game, you know?

18:02.400 --> 18:03.400
Like they do.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.400
2-2 or something.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.520
I don't know.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.520
That's what Ross Tilly UT says.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.440
Kingdom Hearts has shit from the 50s in it.

18:11.440 --> 18:16.640
Even earlier than that, they have the Timeless River or whatever that level is called.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.640
That level is awesome.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.640
That's the Steamboat Willie level.

18:18.640 --> 18:23.200
But you know, that's like classic Disney.

18:23.200 --> 18:27.400
It's not like, they don't have a tailspin level.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.200
Ballora's not wearing it.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.560
That's because tailspin is rip-off of the Jungle Book.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.800
You do get one Gummy Bears reference, which is pretty awesome, because you have the Gummy

18:36.800 --> 18:37.800
Ship, right?

18:37.800 --> 18:39.880
Oh, that's not really the Gummy Bears, though.

18:39.880 --> 18:43.520
But that's what I like to think in my own mind, is that it's a Gummy Bears reference.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.720
The thing has absolutely nothing to do with Gummy Bears.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.720
Shut up!

18:47.720 --> 18:52.400
But we've got our poo level, and I hate the poo levels because they're not all that fun.

18:52.400 --> 18:59.040
Where's my level based on Swiss Family Robinson?

18:59.040 --> 19:00.680
Where's the Herbie Love Bug level?

19:00.680 --> 19:04.840
They need to have Bruce Campbell in that one, too, because Bruce Campbell is in a Herbie

19:04.840 --> 19:05.840
movie.

19:05.840 --> 19:06.840
Or what was the dog?

19:06.840 --> 19:08.040
Not Old Yeller, but the other one.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.440
Shaggy the Dog or whatever it was?

19:09.440 --> 19:10.440
A Shaggy Dog.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.440
A Shaggy Dog.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.440
That's it.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.080
That darn cat below there.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.800
What about the Witch Mountain movies?

19:15.800 --> 19:17.200
All right.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.200
I love those.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.200
Now we're getting random.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.360
Let's please go to another story.

19:20.360 --> 19:27.360
Speaking of random, actually not really, there are new Wii Virtual Console stuff rated out

19:27.360 --> 19:28.360
now.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.880
Thank you, ESRB, you bastards.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.840
Thank you, you bastards.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.160
I love that.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.320
Well, what games are they?

19:37.320 --> 19:38.320
We have...

19:38.320 --> 19:39.320
Faithful News Reporter.

19:39.320 --> 19:43.160
Landstalker, The Treasures of King Knoll.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.260
I never played that.

19:44.260 --> 19:46.000
I've never even fucking heard of that game.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.080
Shinobi 3, Return of the Ninja Master.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.080
I'm sorry.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.960
Shadow Dancer was better.

19:50.960 --> 19:55.120
Shadow Dancer was the best Shinobi game ever.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.120
And...

19:56.120 --> 19:57.120
And...

19:57.120 --> 19:58.120
Ghoulsy Ghosts.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.120
Yay!

19:59.120 --> 20:02.920
Wow, they're really getting obscure on some of these Genesis and TurboGrafx titles that

20:02.920 --> 20:03.920
are coming out.

20:03.920 --> 20:07.280
And yet, we still don't have Guardian Legend, speaking of obscure.

20:07.280 --> 20:12.680
Why don't you have Metal Gear on Virtual Console?

20:12.680 --> 20:15.680
Where are some of the other old Konami classics, besides just Grapple?

20:15.680 --> 20:21.920
You know, there's a good point that they make here that just because it's rated doesn't

20:21.920 --> 20:23.680
mean it's going to come out.

20:23.680 --> 20:30.200
So, who knows, like, what the fuck, Landstalker, whatever.

20:30.200 --> 20:34.320
You know, they should let me pick games for the Virtual Console, because I'd put Panorama

20:34.320 --> 20:38.160
Cotton all up in there.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.480
Rasteel UT makes fun of what Jamie said.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.800
Thank you, you bastards.

20:41.800 --> 20:46.600
Rasteel UT says, I'm very gracious, you retarded spastic fags.

20:46.600 --> 20:53.880
You know, it's like, if I were to pick games for their Virtual Console, I would be just

20:53.880 --> 20:58.380
like, well, how about we pick the one where you fix the fucking internet thing and make

20:58.380 --> 21:04.200
it so it's actually, you know, games playable over, you know, Wi-Fi and shit like that.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.840
Stop working on Virtual Console games and fix my goddamn Wii internet.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.280
Hit an Excitebike and have the save mode work.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.280
Son of Dad has a damn good point.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.920
Where the fuck is Michael Jackson's Moonwalker?

21:12.920 --> 21:13.920
Dude, I know!

21:13.920 --> 21:14.920
That game was great.

21:14.920 --> 21:18.400
I mean, besides all that, you know, child molestation he ran for other countries bullshit.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.400
I mean, come on!

21:19.400 --> 21:20.400
It was a great game.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.600
You know what game that we need on Virtual Console?

21:22.600 --> 21:23.600
The Goonies.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.600
Not the Goonies 2.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.200
No, we need Goonies 2 as well.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.400
Well, we need that eventually, but we need the first one that came out.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.400
I'm saying, where's all the Konami?

21:30.400 --> 21:31.400
There was a first one?

21:31.400 --> 21:32.400
Yes, there was.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.320
Yeah, there was, but only in Japan, I think.

21:34.320 --> 21:39.600
And it had an arcade release that was one of those timed Nintendo crappy games that,

21:39.600 --> 21:43.600
you know, they had the Super Mario Brothers one where all your enemies are beetle bugs.

21:43.600 --> 21:48.080
All right, let's get past that quintessential games we want on Virtual Console stuff.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.440
Get back into some news.

21:49.440 --> 21:55.080
All right, well, it's very unfortunate that this super awesome game is only exclusive

21:55.080 --> 22:00.000
at Walmart, but Chibi-Robo DS, people thought that it might have been scrapped at first,

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
but guess what?

22:01.000 --> 22:05.320
Walmart's going to have the exclusive rights to this super awesome game.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.040
No, really, it really, really sucks.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.360
It is a horrible game, played at E3.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.400
Well, the GameCube one was kind of shitty too.

22:12.400 --> 22:18.800
Well, let me put it this way, the DS captures the essence of the GameCube game perfectly.

22:18.800 --> 22:24.620
So yay, Chibi-Robo Park Patrol will launch October 2nd at Walmart, so you know what?

22:24.620 --> 22:28.640
And Walmart is releasing it in a limited edition baby shit green case.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.640
Who knew?

22:29.640 --> 22:34.480
Oh wait, that's not the case, that's actually baby shit.

22:34.480 --> 22:40.440
Well, I don't know if you could get this at Walmart, but I certainly would like to be

22:40.440 --> 22:42.200
able to get this.

22:42.200 --> 22:48.760
DreamKitty.com is offering these very cute little overlays for your Nintendo DS.

22:48.760 --> 22:51.800
They're Hello Kitty overlays, that's right.

22:51.800 --> 22:57.160
You could take your pink DS light and make it pinker with new Hello Kitty overlays you

22:57.160 --> 23:01.980
can get, and it looks like bling a little bit, like they have gemstones on it, but that's

23:01.980 --> 23:06.280
a little pattern there, Hello Kitty thing on the front, and then little kitty designs.

23:06.280 --> 23:10.200
Actually there's really not any kitties inside, it's all like flowers and gems and all sorts

23:10.200 --> 23:11.200
of other girly shit.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.640
I'm surprised they're not selling this at the Sanrio store.

23:14.640 --> 23:20.520
$16.49 plus shipping if you would like to buy this at DreamKitty.com, and I know I want

23:20.520 --> 23:22.560
it, so we'll see.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.440
I'm seriously considering buying it, how cool would that be?

23:24.440 --> 23:29.880
And as the article says, go for it, you'll sure be the envy of every ten year old girl

23:29.880 --> 23:30.880
on the block.

23:30.880 --> 23:31.880
I know.

23:31.880 --> 23:36.080
Well hold on, when people come into the house and they see my Hello Kitty toaster and my

23:36.080 --> 23:39.000
Hello Kitty coffee maker, it always gets a comment.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Oh my god, you bought that?

23:43.000 --> 23:47.920
No, mostly it's been, oh my gosh, my daughter would love that.

23:47.920 --> 23:51.960
Alright, anyway.

23:51.960 --> 23:56.560
Let's open up the mailbag and get a little serious here on Orange Lounge Radio, and open

23:56.560 --> 24:00.520
up ye old mailbag and see what you guys, listeners, have to say.

24:00.520 --> 24:04.360
Go to OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place you can always send those emails to, and Dark

24:04.360 --> 24:08.000
Soccer is going to dive on in and pull out some of her favorite emails.

24:08.000 --> 24:15.640
So here she goes.

24:15.640 --> 24:21.600
The first of three emails that I'm going to read, it says, Hey, OLR guys, not sure if

24:21.600 --> 24:24.960
this question has been covered before, but if it has, sorry about that, okay, we forgive

24:24.960 --> 24:25.960
you.

24:25.960 --> 24:26.960
Next email.

24:26.960 --> 24:31.200
Sites such as BimaniStyle.com and its message board cater to Bimani players mainly in the

24:31.200 --> 24:32.920
U.S. with an English language.

24:32.920 --> 24:36.760
GameFacts.com is another major site with a large message board that deals with all sorts

24:36.760 --> 24:37.760
of video games.

24:37.760 --> 24:43.920
It is another site with a user base predominantly from the U.S. that speaks English.

24:43.920 --> 24:50.320
Using those two sites as an example and excluding 2chan from the answer, what is one Bimani

24:50.320 --> 24:55.520
site from Japan and one major video game and general site from Japan that caters to players

24:55.520 --> 24:59.780
from the Japanese region with a fully functional message board and a user base from the same

24:59.780 --> 25:00.780
region?

25:00.780 --> 25:05.680
I ask this because we don't hear much from these sites and they don't get much recognition

25:05.680 --> 25:10.160
for being a major thriving site outside of Japan.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.520
Thanks, Snaps.

25:12.520 --> 25:18.800
Well first of all, I think that I'm the only person in this room that really reads much

25:18.800 --> 25:24.480
Japanese and that's maybe 30 kanji if I'm lucky, so we typically don't go to those sites

25:24.480 --> 25:29.960
given that we can't reliably read them and that Nifty Global Gate doesn't always translate

25:29.960 --> 25:30.960
quite right.

25:30.960 --> 25:34.120
Yeah, unfortunately I don't have a lot to give you there for the same reason, like I

25:34.120 --> 25:37.960
don't speak Japanese so going to those sites doesn't do me a lot of good, but I can give

25:37.960 --> 25:38.960
you this.

25:38.960 --> 25:39.960
Erin in Japan.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.680
There is a site, well actually outside of that I can give you one site that's all in

25:42.680 --> 25:47.360
Japanese as far as the what is a good Bimani site with boards to look at and that would

25:47.360 --> 25:54.680
be a website called Mia's Another Leaf and that site is m-i-e-y-a dot cool dot n-e dot

25:54.680 --> 25:58.560
j-p and I first discovered this site because they actually have us linked on it and so

25:58.560 --> 26:02.280
it came up in the referrer's log and so I checked out the site and they run a fully

26:02.280 --> 26:06.560
functional news blog and I'm pretty extensive on the Bimani coverage there and of course

26:06.560 --> 26:10.880
they have some DDR characters, Alice and Emmy in their logo, so you know they've been around

26:10.880 --> 26:12.160
a long time.

26:12.160 --> 26:17.600
The site brags that they've been up since 2001, March 6th of 2001 they've been running

26:17.600 --> 26:20.680
so there you go, that's the site you can definitely check out.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.880
Again that's Mia's Another Leaf.

26:22.880 --> 26:27.280
As far as the more general gaming site, I don't know unfortunately I couldn't tell you.

26:27.280 --> 26:30.080
Next time you send us an email tell us the site you want us to plug and we'll check it

26:30.080 --> 26:31.080
out.

26:31.080 --> 26:34.080
General gaming site, I would say probably Famitsu dot com.

26:34.080 --> 26:36.560
Yeah there is Famitsu.

26:36.560 --> 26:41.080
I'm sure they have forums that go along with it.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.320
Alright next email then.

26:43.320 --> 26:49.720
Next email dun dun dun is um, there's a sigh.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.240
Hello all at Orange Lounge Radio.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.360
You know what Jamie, I officially share your annoyance of children.

26:54.360 --> 26:58.200
Their greedy, sticky fingered, badgering brats who have left in control of parents who don't

26:58.200 --> 27:01.840
know what the hell they're doing can become Satan incarnate.

27:01.840 --> 27:02.840
Wow.

27:02.840 --> 27:07.320
My cousin is a perfect example, complete lack of discipline for that kid.

27:07.320 --> 27:11.560
Also I was at the arcade today for some good old fashioned DDR Max 2 and with my luck there

27:11.560 --> 27:13.880
was a party with a bunch of munchkins running around.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.880
While I played this little girl kept asking me for money.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.160
Now come on.

27:19.160 --> 27:23.320
I was told never to ask strangers for money when I was a kid and I never did.

27:23.320 --> 27:26.120
But yeah her mother wasn't even around either.

27:26.120 --> 27:30.000
Then another kid came up and started jumping on the arrows behind me while I was selecting

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000
a song.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.960
I went to move back onto the map and began to play the song and he almost runs into me.

27:33.960 --> 27:37.320
Thank God his mother finally showed up or that kid would have lost a foot had I stepped

27:37.320 --> 27:38.320
on it.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.680
Ever had this experience at your local arcade with children?

27:40.680 --> 27:41.680
Yeah it sucks.

27:41.680 --> 27:44.320
Whatever you do Jamie, just don't reproduce.

27:44.320 --> 27:47.840
You and your husband will live happy lives.

27:47.840 --> 27:48.840
Sincerely Osifer.

27:48.840 --> 27:49.840
P.S.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.720
I'm not sure if I spelled your name correctly, feel free to connect me.

27:52.720 --> 27:54.800
And Rob, spaz your anger.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.440
You spelled my name correctly by the way.

27:56.440 --> 27:57.440
Thank you.

27:57.440 --> 28:02.520
Well Osifer we'd all like to thank you for the email here at Orange Lounge Radio.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.440
And so would all the screaming children.

28:05.440 --> 28:06.440
I don't know.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.080
I mean you know kids are kids.

28:09.080 --> 28:14.520
I think kids when being parented actively aren't so bad.

28:14.520 --> 28:18.000
But unfortunately at a lot of these types of places like the arcade and Chuck E. Cheese

28:18.000 --> 28:20.760
these are places where the parents go to get a break.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.860
And they just let their kids run around like crazy.

28:22.860 --> 28:25.040
You did it too when you were a kid.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.040
So I didn't.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.040
Really?

28:27.040 --> 28:28.800
I never ran around like crazy.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.800
Never ever?

28:29.800 --> 28:30.800
In just my backyard.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.000
Not in public.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.280
I had an all-girl bicycle gang.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.720
Wait you were a member of a bike gang?

28:38.720 --> 28:44.880
No it was four of us and we would ride the streets like we were on patrol.

28:44.880 --> 28:50.240
Only I had like the best bike of everybody so nobody could keep up with me.

28:50.240 --> 28:54.440
I'm fascinated by the fact that you were in a bike gang when you were a little girl.

28:54.440 --> 28:56.960
That's amazing.

28:56.960 --> 29:00.680
But I wasn't a problem child like that.

29:00.680 --> 29:04.200
Because keep in mind if you grow up in the south your parents don't give a shit about

29:04.200 --> 29:06.040
all this PC bullshit.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.840
They're just going to discipline you.

29:07.840 --> 29:12.140
You have all that stuff that Bill Engvall said about going out to the tree and picking

29:12.140 --> 29:13.520
your own switch.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.480
I did that.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.760
That is cruel and unusual punishment.

29:18.760 --> 29:20.560
Wowzers.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.520
Yeah I had a birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese.

29:22.520 --> 29:25.740
We all ran around like crazy while our parents sat around and gossiped.

29:25.740 --> 29:26.740
That's how it worked.

29:26.740 --> 29:30.240
I think there's a difference between actually going to an arcade and going to a place where

29:30.240 --> 29:33.200
you're expected to be overrun by a bajillion children.

29:33.200 --> 29:39.160
At least with an arcade you expect to have people monitoring their children.

29:39.160 --> 29:41.000
Well look at what's happening in arcades.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.400
They're all turning into birthday palaces.

29:42.400 --> 29:49.480
Well at my arcade when I worked at one we would ask, we would not let any child under

29:49.480 --> 29:54.640
a particular age be without an adult accompanying them.

29:54.640 --> 29:59.720
Even if it was the adult with their little group we wouldn't let them just run amuck.

29:59.720 --> 30:00.720
No small children.

30:00.720 --> 30:01.720
Wow.

30:01.720 --> 30:05.880
But you know, I like Namco.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.480
So shall I go on?

30:07.480 --> 30:08.760
You shall.

30:08.760 --> 30:09.760
Maybe I won't.

30:09.760 --> 30:10.760
I will.

30:10.760 --> 30:11.760
This is from Misty.

30:11.760 --> 30:12.760
Aww.

30:12.760 --> 30:13.760
Hi Misty.

30:13.760 --> 30:15.480
I thought closing on Sundays.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.840
I can't be the only one able to close this night, no.

30:18.840 --> 30:21.480
I can't be the only one able to close this night of the week.

30:21.480 --> 30:22.480
I miss you guys.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.480
Heart Misty.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.480
Aww.

30:24.480 --> 30:25.960
That was a sharp but sweet email.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.960
Well I miss you too.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.400
Is that it?

30:29.400 --> 30:30.400
That's it.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.400
We need more emails.

30:31.400 --> 30:35.040
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you would like to send us some emails.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.440
Give us some more stuff to read next week.

30:36.440 --> 30:41.280
Well before I forget I did want to say that there's no pump up the volume this week either.

30:41.280 --> 30:43.980
Last week there was a funeral.

30:43.980 --> 30:46.440
This week I have a class.

30:46.440 --> 30:47.440
So no pump.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.440
Sorry.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.440
Alright.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.440
We will have some weeknight shows.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.120
Slowly returning probably after the summer.

30:52.120 --> 30:57.480
I know Travis is finally back on Saturdays and I want to say that DMN said he's doing

30:57.480 --> 31:02.380
his thing on Thursdays and whatever so there's lots of stuff coming up as far as the weeknight

31:02.380 --> 31:05.360
shows go and then Wednesday night should be back pretty soon as well after all this summer

31:05.360 --> 31:07.480
craziness has ended.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.720
So let's get back into some game news.

31:09.720 --> 31:10.720
Loki keep us up.

31:10.720 --> 31:11.720
Summer craziness.

31:11.720 --> 31:12.720
Anyways.

31:12.720 --> 31:19.440
Now so I was going to say there's some interesting things.

31:19.440 --> 31:25.400
Not a huge surprise with the day and age that we're living in but airport security is beginning

31:25.400 --> 31:30.840
to inspect game consoles and you know don't worry they're not going to break them open

31:30.840 --> 31:35.720
to make sure that's the game console but they will x-ray them for you and they probably

31:35.720 --> 31:40.280
will I don't think they're going to forbid you from bringing them on the plane but just

31:40.280 --> 31:43.300
so you know it will be x-rayed.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.520
I mean is anyone surprised?

31:45.520 --> 31:50.240
I bring DS's on the plane and you just have to put them on the x-ray belt like anything

31:50.240 --> 31:51.240
else so.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.240
Exactly.

31:52.240 --> 31:56.440
It doesn't seem like anything new to me but I guess maybe the big fat consoles they're

31:56.440 --> 32:00.940
doing now like if you put them in your luggage maybe they're like my wife and go why are

32:00.940 --> 32:07.760
you bringing that around it's not a portable console what the fuck because you're a hardcore

32:07.760 --> 32:13.000
nerd I don't know yes well one thing you could bring around with you if you own an iPhone

32:13.000 --> 32:21.520
is NES games that's right there's new NES emulator for the iPhone and it doesn't run

32:21.520 --> 32:26.880
so great but it's kind of cool that it's actually in production it actually produces a little

32:26.880 --> 32:31.000
tiny Nintendo style controller on the bottom of your iPhone screen and then you play the

32:31.000 --> 32:38.080
game in the main iPhone display it's pretty I guess simple to get up and running but unfortunately

32:38.080 --> 32:42.600
it's slow there's no sound the controls are not that great for right now but hey it's

32:42.600 --> 32:46.640
a start and it shows that it can be done now the first thing you got to do is of course

32:46.640 --> 32:50.400
you have to you know kind of hack your iPhone because you know the way you get some of the

32:50.400 --> 32:58.880
other stuff on there but it's possible it's very possible anything is possible of course

32:58.880 --> 33:04.520
I don't have an iPhone so I couldn't tell you I got to see melody's iPhone oh yeah how's

33:04.520 --> 33:08.720
she liking that she likes it okay I actually thought it was going to be fairly prohibitive

33:08.720 --> 33:13.760
you know and in the service plan but apparently if you're already like I'm with singular right

33:13.760 --> 33:17.060
now apparently if you're already with them then it's actually just an upgrade to your

33:17.060 --> 33:22.400
plan and not like their whole new expensive you know gouge you in the you know eyeball

33:22.400 --> 33:26.480
price well that's cool I heard stories about someone being charged three thousand dollars

33:26.480 --> 33:31.880
for browsing the internet on their iPhone oh my lord no um they have like some unlimited

33:31.880 --> 33:36.000
servicing but I don't know I still don't want one I want you know a phone that I can text

33:36.000 --> 33:40.960
with that's it yeah the iPhone's a bit much for me I mean I own a phone that doesn't shut

33:40.960 --> 33:45.940
off every you know randomly I understand why people are all getting into it but it's just

33:45.940 --> 33:52.960
not for me just not for me you know I have a laptop I'm happy with it anyway there is

33:52.960 --> 34:00.360
a little bit of information coming out of the South Park camp for anyone who is picking

34:00.360 --> 34:08.200
up the season 10 DVD bundle you get a 14-day trial of World of Warcraft which is kind of

34:08.200 --> 34:12.600
funny because season 10 had the Warcraft episode in it huh yeah but also Blizzard helped them

34:12.600 --> 34:19.280
with it which I thought was funny wow but what I don't know I finally saw the episode

34:19.280 --> 34:28.600
it was funny I would think that most people man bathroom I would think that most I would

34:28.600 --> 34:33.880
think that most people who watch South Park have probably already given World of Warcraft

34:33.880 --> 34:39.680
to try once in their life at least I just thought that I haven't you know you know who

34:39.680 --> 34:43.080
I finally got to play World of Warcraft this week by the way I heard you're finally back

34:43.080 --> 34:47.600
like I saw your post in the forums well yeah if anyone would actually add my noob character

34:47.600 --> 34:50.800
to the guild and tell me what you're gonna be on tell me when you're gonna be on next

34:50.800 --> 34:54.920
and I'll I'll send you money and get you in the guild okay and you know who you can play

34:54.920 --> 35:00.360
with now who's also a noob William the boyfriend is on he started playing World of Warcraft

35:00.360 --> 35:04.180
because he was such a Starcraft fan like he still plays Starcraft now it's like the one

35:04.180 --> 35:08.880
game he really does play and is really into and you know we kind of said well if you like

35:08.880 --> 35:11.480
that game why aren't you playing like World of Warcraft or some of the other blizzard

35:11.480 --> 35:15.680
titles so he tried it out and he loved it so now he sucked into it World of Warcraft

35:15.680 --> 35:22.300
when there's absolutely nothing else to do so I play about once a month but when I play

35:22.300 --> 35:25.940
I play for a while yeah stay far away while you still can because once you get sucked

35:25.940 --> 35:30.980
in it's it's it's bad I won't get sucked in well even when I played Final Fantasy 11

35:30.980 --> 35:37.080
I didn't get sucked in that's because you hated it but I was really good with a controller

35:37.080 --> 35:41.800
hey I could do all that macro crap with a controller that's cool hey you should have

35:41.800 --> 35:45.560
been playing on 360 you saw you saw me do that too I know and I remember commenting

35:45.560 --> 35:48.960
like wow how do you do all that shit with a controller of course the game was designed

35:48.960 --> 35:52.520
for the PlayStation 2 so it's supposed to be played with a controller but I I would

35:52.520 --> 35:57.280
never be able to do it I I actually had a hard time figure out the macros on my function

35:57.280 --> 36:00.640
key so I just like screw it I use my controller and then I got so pissed off I couldn't play

36:00.640 --> 36:10.200
World of Warcraft with the controller I was like damn it all right anyway yes this only

36:10.200 --> 36:20.680
could come from Second Life but apparently there is a virtual sex program called I guess

36:20.680 --> 36:26.940
made by a company called Eros LLC and it makes realistic genitalia and creates sexual moves

36:26.940 --> 36:34.800
for Second Life citizens and apparently this one guy who created it found out that his

36:34.800 --> 36:41.560
works have been resold by someone else who has been claiming that he made it but so now

36:41.560 --> 36:55.680
he is going to be suing them actually it's interesting the whole sex in Second Life but

36:55.680 --> 36:59.880
somebody should sue everybody involved for bringing sex to Second Life I mean really

36:59.880 --> 37:05.200
because that's all some people think about and where the hell is that three feel game

37:05.200 --> 37:11.320
that we saw e3 two years ago hello random three feel was great it was funny because

37:11.320 --> 37:15.760
they're no no no no don't do that they had to get their translator because I wasn't supposed

37:15.760 --> 37:22.320
to click the button SSJ 100 matt says because we can make girly count SSJ 100 man our charm

37:22.320 --> 37:30.400
says because people can't get First Life sex that's fine I guess well on to a little bit

37:30.400 --> 37:35.080
more serious note and something not often talked about would be the good side of gaming

37:35.080 --> 37:39.200
you know we hear about all these laws and all these you know sex-crazed pervs ruining

37:39.200 --> 37:44.520
games well there's some good news about the good of gaming that's going on and it's actually

37:44.520 --> 37:51.600
thanks to Wii Sports the Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute at Minneapolis's Abbott Northwestern

37:51.600 --> 37:57.480
Hospital actually aids patients who suffered from strokes by letting them play Wii Sports

37:57.480 --> 38:03.660
that's right it's kind of a little bit of their rehab program kind of interesting coordination

38:03.660 --> 38:08.320
there's actually an article that was ran in a local paper called the Star Tribune that

38:08.320 --> 38:12.920
talks about the we have a program and even has a picture of a guy they're playing Wii

38:12.920 --> 38:19.240
Sports so kind of cool there and let's see you a quote here from one of the patients

38:19.240 --> 38:24.320
quote I'm not a video game player this is the only one I've ever played because of the

38:24.320 --> 38:28.140
interaction of the game I get the physical sensation of playing tennis it really works

38:28.140 --> 38:34.840
it can fool me into thinking that I'm doing what's happening on the screen kind of cool

38:34.840 --> 38:40.520
so that's cool that's why we play games to so we won't get strokes I mean I don't I play

38:40.520 --> 38:47.400
games because they're fun I don't well but it's both simulation games anyway well I'm

38:47.400 --> 38:51.840
glad to see the games being used for good and reporting on you know some of the good

38:51.840 --> 38:57.100
stuff about games so there you go of course I don't know I if these patients are like

38:57.100 --> 39:03.040
me they're gonna get bored of Wii Sports in a day or so but maybe I'm just jaded I think

39:03.040 --> 39:10.040
it's more fun if you've got people there with you true at any rate though for those who

39:10.040 --> 39:16.500
were are into simulations speaking of that type of thing well not really it's rock band

39:16.500 --> 39:28.400
I mean hey a price point is released of $199 and if you have an Xbox 360 guess what no

39:28.400 --> 39:38.240
wireless screwed who cares wireless is kind of overrated wires are long wires can be extended

39:38.240 --> 39:43.760
wrap up the wires stop being so lazy it's wireless really that big a deal maybe I guess

39:43.760 --> 39:48.720
I don't think so especially if you've got the drum hooked up with the wires and a microphone

39:48.720 --> 39:52.400
hooked up with the wires and you're gonna have a tripping hazard all right I'll give

39:52.400 --> 39:56.240
you that the only issue that this game is going to have with that is not everyone's

39:56.240 --> 40:02.400
going to have a USB port hub and what you're going to try to play for players you like

40:02.400 --> 40:10.440
were the other USB port so you know that's the only issue that this will have but the

40:10.440 --> 40:15.600
reason why I think they're not doing wireless is because you know to license the wireless

40:15.600 --> 40:21.320
you know technology patent or whatever from Microsoft Microsoft just give them a buy on

40:21.320 --> 40:26.800
it for this it caught well look at guitar hero I mean their guitars are ten dollars

40:26.800 --> 40:34.440
more for the wireless so I don't know not a big deal though but it is pretty cool if

40:34.440 --> 40:39.520
you don't want to get the $199 bundle though with it you can actually buy the game by itself

40:39.520 --> 40:44.740
and then all the guitars and stuff will be sold separately at a certain retailers out

40:44.740 --> 40:48.400
there because you can use a guitar here controller on it right yeah I think so so if I already

40:48.400 --> 40:51.520
have guitar hero two then I'm pretty much and I'm not really interested in the drums

40:51.520 --> 40:55.920
honestly I just want to play online with friends and I can use a guitar and I'll do the vocals

40:55.920 --> 41:02.620
oh I'm getting the set same I know it's stupid because I hate guitar hero you won't play

41:02.620 --> 41:07.320
it past a day I give it a day that you're gonna play it and that's it I'm getting I'm

41:07.320 --> 41:14.680
of course gonna get the set now you might give it two days no we still play guitar hero

41:14.680 --> 41:18.360
at my house you you damn time you and Dan will have fun with that because Dan likes

41:18.360 --> 41:22.280
to play guitar right he brings his buddies over yeah and of course that's when I go hide

41:22.280 --> 41:25.960
because you know they all get extra manly around each other well that's the thing I

41:25.960 --> 41:29.320
just I won't buy the game because I'll just go over to Loki's house to play it or your

41:29.320 --> 41:33.260
house come to my house well if all we still need to play Super Metroid Rob oh we sure

41:33.260 --> 41:39.360
do let's do that um soon Wednesday no yeah Wednesday maybe Wednesday I don't think though

41:39.360 --> 41:43.080
the show will be back this week we'll do it live on air yeah that'll be the Wednesday

41:43.080 --> 41:46.640
show from Metroid Rob and Jamie play Super Metroid on air that actually might be kind

41:46.640 --> 41:51.560
of a fun show we should actually make that like a regular show like Rob and Jamie play

41:51.560 --> 41:57.960
something on air and today we have the Atari 5200 we're playing kicks but because it's

41:57.960 --> 42:02.760
the Atari 5200 none of the controllers work yeah we could run it through the camera thing

42:02.760 --> 42:05.640
I'll have to show you later like we put a camera on the TV and do it that way let's

42:05.640 --> 42:13.200
do that I think we can show OMG OMG all right anyhow sorry we're gonna open up the Skype

42:13.200 --> 42:17.000
line very soon but we got one more story for you guys before we do that and of course when

42:17.000 --> 42:21.240
the Skype line is open you can give us a call to talk to us our username on Skype is orange

42:21.240 --> 42:28.280
lounge radio or you can actually call us on the real phone 1-877-GAME-OLR anyway so Circuit

42:28.280 --> 42:35.120
City isn't too happy with CheapAssGamer because of course as you'll remember one of their

42:35.120 --> 42:44.760
forum posters by the name of Speedy1961 had leaked the ads from Circuit City to the website

42:44.760 --> 42:51.320
and of course that revealed the price drop information for the Playstation 3 and none

42:51.320 --> 42:57.560
were too happy about that so they've actually subpoenaed CheapAssGamer to try to find out

42:57.560 --> 43:05.800
who the real identity of Speedy1961 is but of course CheapAssGamer is going to be fighting

43:05.800 --> 43:12.400
this because they want to protect the rights of their posters so it should be interesting

43:12.400 --> 43:21.880
RasteelUT says looks like an employee is going to get his ass fired I don't know if it's

43:21.880 --> 43:25.800
an employee of any one of those because I think they also had Best Buy and other types

43:25.800 --> 43:30.480
of ads leaked as well Rob D says we got to fight for our right to

43:30.480 --> 43:38.760
ad scan well I mean what do you guys think do you think they have the right to be putting

43:38.760 --> 43:41.960
out the subpoena out there or do you think maybe if they wanted to protect the information

43:41.960 --> 43:45.520
they shouldn't have kind of leaked it in the first place both I think well I don't know

43:45.520 --> 43:51.660
if they have I mean granted it's you know stuff that's not supposed to be out there

43:51.660 --> 43:55.800
so they have the right to protect that but at the same time you know they should be more

43:55.800 --> 44:00.880
careful with you know information getting leaked maybe have more of these people signing

44:00.880 --> 44:07.880
you know non-disclosure agreements and stuff like that I don't know if there's any if they

44:07.880 --> 44:12.880
are smart there should be some sort of policy you know regarding this if it is an employee

44:12.880 --> 44:18.600
that's you know doing that and they should be able to take proper action based on that

44:18.600 --> 44:23.240
policy if they don't have a policy in place for that then well you know you kind of setting

44:23.240 --> 44:27.760
yourself up for trouble all right well you guys can call right now and give us your opinion

44:27.760 --> 44:32.400

Halloween costumes. Oh, I don't know about that. I want Master Chief Underroos.

47:12.340 --> 47:14.340
She'll wear them around the house.

47:14.340 --> 47:16.340
Let me end on one thing and say I hate them.

47:16.340 --> 47:19.340
I've seen entire angels. Wish she was dancing in her Underoos.

47:20.540 --> 47:26.980
No, I don't know you probably some of the other stuff you mentioned though is certainly a possibility clocks, watches,

47:26.980 --> 47:34.980
Figurines, books, other collectibles, you name it. It'll be there. Now the chat room is just going crazy.

47:35.980 --> 47:40.980
Son of Dad says Halo 3 condoms. Tiger Claw says Halo 3 the cereal box.

47:41.980 --> 47:45.980
Oh Bandit says Halo underwear for those who need extra man cannon support. There you go.

47:49.980 --> 47:52.980
Let me end with this note. I hate the MacBook Pro. Thank you.

47:52.980 --> 47:54.980
Alright, you're welcome. Have a good one buddy. Thanks for calling.

47:54.980 --> 47:56.980
YouTube. Bye.

47:56.980 --> 47:59.980
Alright, let's go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.

47:59.980 --> 48:06.980
Again, if you want to give us a call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

48:09.980 --> 48:13.980
And unfortunately only one call can come through at a time or everything kind of gets screwed up here.

48:13.980 --> 48:15.980
So we're going to another call.

48:17.980 --> 48:20.980
Man, I can't handle this. This Skype needs to be changed.

48:20.980 --> 48:22.980
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

48:22.980 --> 48:24.980
Um...

48:26.980 --> 48:27.980
Hello?

48:27.980 --> 48:28.980
Yeah.

48:28.980 --> 48:30.980
Hi, hello. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

48:30.980 --> 48:35.980
Nah, it's Legend of Zaku. Just seeing, you know, since I was trying to get through it and everything.

48:35.980 --> 48:37.980
That's alright. What's on your mind buddy?

48:37.980 --> 48:41.980
Uh, nothing. Just trying to struggle through disappointments over the weekend.

48:41.980 --> 48:45.980
In particular, Supernova 2, which has been crapping out in Jersey Gardens.

48:45.980 --> 48:50.980
I've heard that there's another location test for DDR Supernova 2. What's the deal?

48:50.980 --> 48:56.980
It was the same place where they had the second Supernova location.

48:56.980 --> 48:59.980
You know, they had another Supernova location test last year.

48:59.980 --> 49:08.980
Anyways, what I've been able to gather from all the folks around my area that actually went to the location test on Thursday.

49:08.980 --> 49:20.980
There were brand new Paranoias discovered. In particular, Paranoia Hades. Just started shaping up to become a really good 9-footer.

49:20.980 --> 49:26.980
I'm trying to dig up the information right now. We have crossovers in the form of Bloody Tears.

49:26.980 --> 49:32.980
You know, that Castlevania song from Distorted actually now making its appearance in DDR.

49:32.980 --> 49:42.980
I'm trying to see what else. I know it was a whole bunch of videos, but I'll post it right now in the chat.

49:42.980 --> 49:50.980
Wait, so you actually got to play the test. You went out to Jersey to play the test. Hello?

49:50.980 --> 49:58.980
Not really. Because, you know, it was working up until Thursday and then Friday was just crapping out ever since.

49:58.980 --> 50:03.980
Saturday it managed to get up, but then it started crashing after just scrolling through songs.

50:03.980 --> 50:06.980
When I showed up today, it was still back to Supernova.

50:06.980 --> 50:11.980
I see. A band that says if you just type Supernova 2 into YouTube, you can get a bunch of stuff.

50:11.980 --> 50:16.980
It is a test machine, Zaku. It's not going to work perfectly, right?

50:16.980 --> 50:22.980
Right. I assume they had a bad upgrade kit for all intents and purposes.

50:22.980 --> 50:27.980
They're probably going to straighten those issues out. It could be hardware related.

50:27.980 --> 50:34.980
Let me try to keep this constructive. Zaku, what would be the one thing you would want to see Konami do with Supernova 2?

50:34.980 --> 50:40.980
Well, I know they probably won't be able to do this. Memory card slots, which is damn near impossible at this point.

50:40.980 --> 50:48.980
EMUs would be nice. Just follow through on it. Make it offline in addition to online versions.

50:48.980 --> 50:58.980
Just so they could get more arcades to adopt it for those that don't have the money or don't have the means of actually getting an internet connection.

50:58.980 --> 51:02.980
All right. Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, Zaku?

51:02.980 --> 51:10.980
That's pretty much it. Hopefully, if that thing gets back up, try to get some more info.

51:10.980 --> 51:25.980
But as far as it goes, there are brand new 10-footers showing up, especially from the videos. Especially in the only course boss rush.

51:25.980 --> 51:29.980
So it certainly gives something to keep people busy, huh?

51:29.980 --> 51:37.980
So far, it's been positive. We're just trying to get through the issues that are holding the test room happier further.

51:37.980 --> 51:42.980
All right. Well, Zaku, we're going to let you go so we can take more calls. Thank you very much for your call. We appreciate it.

51:42.980 --> 51:49.980
How's it going? Again, if you want to call us, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

51:49.980 --> 51:51.980
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

51:51.980 --> 51:52.980
GS68.

51:52.980 --> 51:54.980
Hi, GS68. What's on your mind, buddy?

51:54.980 --> 51:56.980
Finally got to play Maximum Tune 3.

51:56.980 --> 51:58.980
Oh, what'd you think?

51:58.980 --> 52:08.980
Pretty awesome. Especially like the new Ghost Battle mode where you raise someone's ghost and then after that your ghost gets created.

52:08.980 --> 52:11.980
And then after that the machine creates a ghost of your driving.

52:11.980 --> 52:17.980
Now, out of curiosity, did you play this on the PlayStation or did you play this on the arcade?

52:17.980 --> 52:19.980
I'm talking about the arcade one.

52:19.980 --> 52:25.980
I think the PlayStation 3 one is based off an older game or something. But you played the PlayStation 3 one. What'd you think?

52:25.980 --> 52:30.980
I didn't get it, but again, I can't read Japanese, but I didn't get any sense of what the hell was going on.

52:30.980 --> 52:36.980
I mean, obviously there was racing, but I had no idea what the hell was going on. I mean, that's the downside about importing Japanese games.

52:36.980 --> 52:39.980
You don't speak the language. I mean, duh, you're not going to understand the game.

52:39.980 --> 52:48.980
The one thing I noticed, I thought the music in the thing I was listening to sucked. I didn't think the music was that great.

52:48.980 --> 52:51.980
You mean the one in Maximum Tune 3?

52:51.980 --> 52:54.980
Yeah, how is the music in Maximum Tune 3 GS68 in the arcades?

52:54.980 --> 52:57.980
That's some pretty good stuff.

52:57.980 --> 53:04.980
Does it sound like Yuzo Koshiro did it again? Is it the same stuff from Maximum Tune 2?

53:04.980 --> 53:06.980
Yeah, I've already got a few favorites.

53:06.980 --> 53:10.980
Oh, cool. Well, then that's a good sign. I don't know what the hell's wrong with the PlayStation 1 then.

53:10.980 --> 53:15.980
Maybe you just haven't played far enough into it or we're just not understanding what the hell we're doing. I don't know.

53:15.980 --> 53:16.980
But it didn't look like that much fun.

53:16.980 --> 53:18.980
I'm thinking about reselling on eBay.

53:18.980 --> 53:25.980
We'll see. Well, certainly I will check out the arcade one if they get in an arcade near us. Maybe I'll change my mind.

53:25.980 --> 53:28.980
Or hopefully the PlayStation 1 will come out here eventually. So we'll see.

53:28.980 --> 53:35.980
Is it really popular? I mean, are there long lines to play it? Because the racing games seem to still draw crowds at the arcades.

53:35.980 --> 53:43.980
Well, I've played it both at Cityville Golf and Mepitas Golf, and there's about four or five people waiting on each machine.

53:43.980 --> 53:48.980
Wow. For this day and age, that's still a long wait. That's a popular game.

53:48.980 --> 53:53.980
Anything else you want to share with our listeners? GS68.

53:53.980 --> 53:54.980
No.

53:54.980 --> 53:59.980
I will definitely check out Maximum Tune 3 when I get a chance and let you know. Like the arcade version.

53:59.980 --> 54:02.980
I'm not going to base it off a Japanese game I can't understand.

54:02.980 --> 54:03.980
All right.

54:03.980 --> 54:04.980
All right. Take care, buddy.

54:04.980 --> 54:05.980
You too.

54:05.980 --> 54:06.980
All right. Bye-bye.

54:06.980 --> 54:14.980
All right. We've got enough time for about one more call here. If you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our user name on Skype is Orangelaunchradio.

54:14.980 --> 54:16.980
But we have another call. Let's go to it.

54:16.980 --> 54:21.980
Hi, you're on Orangelaunchradio. Who's this?

54:21.980 --> 54:25.980
Hi, you are on Orangelaunchradio. Is somebody there? Can you hear me? Hello?

54:25.980 --> 54:27.980
It's a celebrity. It's Airman.

54:27.980 --> 54:30.980
Hello, this is Chris Alp, where you can pre-order Madden OA and Halo 3. How can I help you?

54:30.980 --> 54:32.980
Hi. Oh, there you are.

54:32.980 --> 54:38.980
Hi, GameStop, where we can pre-order. I want to pre-order Halo 6. Will you take that for me?

54:38.980 --> 54:40.980
No, it's actually the Rob D. How's it going, guys?

54:40.980 --> 54:42.980
Oh, good. How about you, Rob D?

54:42.980 --> 54:57.980
Not too shabby. I was actually curious. With this Halo Mountain Dew, which I actually did go out and purchase during the break, by the way, because someone described it as a cross between Code Red and regular Mountain Dew, and I love Code Red, but that's a different story altogether.

54:57.980 --> 54:58.980
Is it good?

54:58.980 --> 55:07.980
I actually like it. It's kind of like a Pepsi or Mountain Dew version of, I guess, Sprite, Tropical Remix, if you remember that from a few years ago.

55:07.980 --> 55:10.980
Yeah, where the hell are you all getting this at? Like 7-Eleven?

55:10.980 --> 55:13.980
What was that? I got it from the local market, actually.

55:13.980 --> 55:15.980
Oh, huh. I'll have to look for it while I'm out next.

55:15.980 --> 55:20.980
Wait, am I really going to buy a drink just because there's some remote game thing in it? You know what, no.

55:20.980 --> 55:22.980
I won't buy it because it's not sugar-free.

55:22.980 --> 55:24.980
I'm not going to buy it. Fuck this drink. I don't care what it tastes like.

55:24.980 --> 55:27.980
Hey, you bought the blue Pepsi, okay? Come on, you'll buy anything.

55:27.980 --> 55:30.980
That's true. That Pepsi Blue was some nasty, nasty shit.

55:30.980 --> 55:32.980
But, Rob, we remember Crystal Pepsi.

55:32.980 --> 55:36.980
Oh, Crystal Pepsi was lovely. All right, anyway, sorry, Rob D., your thoughts?

55:36.980 --> 55:43.980
But I was curious, what licensing agreement between games and some other product would you like to see?

55:43.980 --> 55:53.980
I mean, I think that Nintendo's missing a huge thing with not doing, say, a Mario pasta thing, like, hey, it's a Mario Mastachioli.

55:53.980 --> 55:57.980
You know, I thought that they had a Mario pasta at one time. I swear to God.

55:57.980 --> 56:00.980
Didn't they have the Nintendo Breakfast Entertainment System?

56:00.980 --> 56:01.980
No, bring back the cereal.

56:01.980 --> 56:05.980
They did have Mario pasta. I remember they had that because there was, like, a little Yoshi shape.

56:05.980 --> 56:09.980
It was like Nintendo mac and cheese or something.

56:09.980 --> 56:17.980
And to tell Dark Tetsuya Hello Kitty 2DX, it was the Hello Kitty Dreamcast and the Hello Kitty PlayStation 2.

56:17.980 --> 56:20.980
Gosh, what video game tie-ins would you like to see?

56:20.980 --> 56:26.980
I want to see Burger Time 2 with the Foreman Grill.

56:26.980 --> 56:30.980
How about, like, Night Trap 90s? Digital Pictures would still be around if that existed.

56:30.980 --> 56:33.980
You could have, like, PS2 FMV games. Oh.

56:33.980 --> 56:36.980
Night Trap 90s? What?

56:36.980 --> 56:39.980
Yeah, but Dana Plato's not with us anymore to model them.

56:39.980 --> 56:43.980
I do like the Halo 3 Underoos. That's pretty awesome.

56:43.980 --> 56:45.980
From the grave.

56:45.980 --> 56:46.980
Exactly.

56:46.980 --> 56:48.980
That's all kinds of weird.

56:48.980 --> 56:51.980
They're all about the necrophilia tonight.

56:51.980 --> 56:54.980
This is random.

56:54.980 --> 56:57.980
Let's see. I'm opening up to the chat room to see what the chat room thinks.

56:57.980 --> 57:02.980
Son of Dad says, Nintendo Wii Sports Bowling Shoes.

57:02.980 --> 57:08.980
GS68 says, Halo Racing Game with Warthogs, Ghosts, and Pontiac Grand Amps.

57:08.980 --> 57:09.980
A reference to something in the last game.

57:09.980 --> 57:11.980
We need your mom, the game.

57:11.980 --> 57:15.980
Jvmon says, Mario Spaghetti from Chef Boyardee.

57:15.980 --> 57:18.980
How about Chef Mario?

57:21.980 --> 57:23.980
Give me that.

57:23.980 --> 57:25.980
I don't know.

57:25.980 --> 57:28.980
Yeah, I'm drawing a blank.

57:28.980 --> 57:32.980
I'll have to think about that one. Maybe that's a future list list in our future. I don't know.

57:32.980 --> 57:33.980
There you go.

57:33.980 --> 57:34.980
I have one more question for you guys.

57:34.980 --> 57:36.980
Of course. What's up? One more thing.

57:36.980 --> 57:38.980
Nah, not going there.

57:38.980 --> 57:44.980
Have you guys heard the news about how 3D Realms supposedly wants to port Duke Nukem 3D over to Xbox Live Arcade?

57:44.980 --> 57:47.980
Stop ruining my last minute stories, dammit!

57:47.980 --> 57:50.980
The callers are ruining your last minute stories tonight.

57:50.980 --> 57:55.980
No, that's great. Yes, I did read that story, even if Loki was going to read it later.

57:55.980 --> 58:00.980
This is totally good radio, but I was going to show you. See, they did have it at one time.

58:00.980 --> 58:03.980
Here's a commercial for Super Mario Bros. Craft and Macaroni and Cheese.

58:09.980 --> 58:11.980
I want that.

58:11.980 --> 58:14.980
How come my mom didn't buy me that when I was a kid?

58:14.980 --> 58:18.980
I actually remember that because they had tips for Super Mario Land 2 on the back.

58:18.980 --> 58:20.980
That's how I found out about the space world.

58:20.980 --> 58:23.980
You know what I fucking hate, though, is the macaroni and cheese that's made out of the powder.

58:23.980 --> 58:25.980
That shit is so nasty.

58:25.980 --> 58:27.980
The bunny ones are good.

58:27.980 --> 58:33.980
I like that if I'm going to make mac and cheese, I have to use that more creamy cheese sauce because the powder is nasty.

58:33.980 --> 58:35.980
Anyway, sorry. That was horrible radio.

58:35.980 --> 58:38.980
And I even forgot what your second question was.

58:38.980 --> 58:41.980
I didn't actually get to it yet. I was wondering if you had read the story.

58:41.980 --> 58:45.980
I was wondering what other old PC games would you like to see ported to Xbox Live Arcade?

58:45.980 --> 58:52.980
I've been clamoring for X-Wing for a long time. I would love multiplayer X-Wing on Xbox Live Arcade.

58:52.980 --> 58:54.980
But is there anything else?

58:54.980 --> 58:59.980
Okay, we've got Loom. Put Loom on the list. We got it. Check. Understood. Yes, ma'am.

58:59.980 --> 59:01.980
Loom was great.

59:01.980 --> 59:03.980
Really?

59:03.980 --> 59:05.980
Loom, mac and cheese.

59:05.980 --> 59:12.980
No, I went and bought a copy of Loom like a year ago on eBay just because I wanted it badly and I can't play it.

59:12.980 --> 59:17.980
There's your branding. A Loom branded Loom. Wouldn't that be wonderful?

59:17.980 --> 59:19.980
What's this made out of, Rob?

59:19.980 --> 59:21.980
I don't know. Glass.

59:21.980 --> 59:24.980
Let's see. The ferret's in a box where it belongs.

59:24.980 --> 59:26.980
No!

59:26.980 --> 59:31.980
What other old, besides Civilization, just because that's my favorite PC game of all time.

59:31.980 --> 59:33.980
Descent. Completely redone.

59:33.980 --> 59:36.980
Descent. That would be kind of cool.

59:36.980 --> 59:39.980
Like, I'm trying to think of games that would make good multiplayer games.

59:39.980 --> 59:40.980
Descent.

59:40.980 --> 59:42.980
I remember that from my younger days.

59:42.980 --> 59:44.980
Modem Wars. Redneck Rampage.

59:44.980 --> 59:45.980
Yeah!

59:45.980 --> 59:47.980
Carmageddon.

59:47.980 --> 59:50.980
I went Jess Jackrabbit or Commander Keen. Anyone else play those?

59:50.980 --> 59:51.980
What? Commander Keen?

59:51.980 --> 59:52.980
Commander Keen, yeah.

59:52.980 --> 59:53.980
Or Jess Jackrabbit?

59:53.980 --> 59:55.980
I think Jess Jackrabbit.

59:55.980 --> 59:57.980
Was Jill of the Jungle? Hell yeah.

59:57.980 --> 01:00:00.980
Or ZZT while we're at it, although I don't think that would really work.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:01.980
ZZT.

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:02.980
That wouldn't work on Xbox 360, I don't think.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.980
We need Gemstone!

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:04.980
ZZT for the win.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.980
How's that for your MMO?

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:08.980
You actually played ZZT? It's been years since I played that game.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.980
We need, like, the old text-based MMOs.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.980
Yes, I went Zork on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:20.980
You saw the page that's a 404 error that's Zork, right?

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.980
Yeah, I've seen that. That's great.

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:25.980
Enter room. You can't enter room.

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:29.980
Did you ever play the Crimson Room game?

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:30.980
Mm-mm.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.980
It was, um, it's a Flash game.

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.980
They need those type of games on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:37.980
How about Oregon Trail on Xbox Live Arcade?

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.980
There's number munchers for that.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.980
That'd be pretty rad.

01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:44.980
We were talking about Oregon Trail, Rob.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.980
At, um, at Pina Gogo. Not Pina Gogo, that's the old one.

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:48.980
At California Extreme.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.980
Yeah?

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.980
It was me and Julie and Dan and Mel and Melody at the Ben and Jerry's.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.980
Talking about Oregon Trail and all those.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:59.980
And, um, we were talking about our favorite old games.

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.980
Reliving Diphtheria over and over again.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.980
I was like, dude, Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:07.980
There you go. There's another great Xbox Live potential. I don't know.

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.980
Where in Time, specifically.

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:11.980
Now we're just naming random shit.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:14.980
No, I'm not. I'm serious. I want that game again.

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:16.980
I was good at it, too.

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:18.980
Well, Rob D., let me ask you. Oh, thank you.

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.980
Shadow Charlie in chat says Heretic. Yes, we need that game.

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.980
Monkeys Island. No, we just need Hexen.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.980
Rob D., what would you want?

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:29.980
X-Wing and X-Wing Commander Keen and, well, actually, just X-Wing and Jazz Jack

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.980
would be the two that I could think of.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.980
Just because those had multiplayer in there already

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.980
that would translate perfectly to Xbox Live or Cade.

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.980
How about One Must Fall?

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.980
Phantasmagoria.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:40.980
Can you do?

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.980
No, seriously, Phantasmagoria.

01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:45.980
Phantasmagoria was huge. It was like seven CDs, wasn't it?

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.980
It could fit.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:48.980
It's old now.

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:53.980
Well, Rob D., thank you for the conversation about good PC gaming retro goodness.

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:55.980
We've got to let you go and wrap up the show.

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:56.980
No problem. See you guys later.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:58.980
All right, take care, buddy. Bye-bye.

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:00.980
All right, well, that's going to do it for tonight's Skype line.

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.980
Thanks so much to those that called in

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.980
and sorry to those that didn't get through,

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.980
but if we took any more calls, then Loki's last-minute stories might get spoiled.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:11.980
So, Loki, if you have any last-minute stories, please, now's the time.

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:13.980
Anyways, let's see.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:18.980
Duke Nuke with 3D is waiting for the Microsoft's Xbox Live arcade go-ahead,

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:21.980
so I'm going to remove that.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:26.980
Okay, and BioShock on the marketplace. Bye-bye.

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:28.980
Let's see here. Oh, yeah.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:36.980
There is apparently a TIFF exploit now in the PlayStation 3 firmware, 1.81,

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:43.980
and they've gotten apparently a backup of a PlayStation 1 game to run on it.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.980
Yay.

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.980
What game?

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.980
I don't know.

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:50.980
And then also a Hello World little demo thing.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.980
Sorry, it was Crash Bandicoot Crash Party.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.980
Therefore, this thing has no usefulness whatsoever

01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:58.980
because nobody wants to play that fucking game.

01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.980
It was Pandemonium.

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:00.980
Pandemonium.

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:02.980
It was Devil Ties. Enjoy.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:08.980
And then I'm going to say this heavily erring on the rumor aspect,

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:12.980
but apparently some random GameStop employee said,

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:19.980
Hey, there's going to be an Xbox 360 Ultimate with an HDMI port and HD DVD drive

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.980
because if he's saying it, oh, it's got to be true.

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:22.980
It must be true.

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.980
Why is that even being reported on the site anywhere?

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:29.980
Because this one website likes to report complete rumor stories like that.

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:33.980
Then again, we ran the Sega list, but only because somebody submitted it.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:34.980
And because I wanted it to be true.

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:39.980
Yeah, we just wanted it to be true.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:43.980
All right, anyhow, I have one other last minute story here

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.980
coming out of Anderson, South Carolina.

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.980
Thanks, TigerClaw, for sending me the link because I think this is all kinds of funny.

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.980
This actually happened at a Toys R Us.

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:53.980
There was a 13-year-old PlayStation hater at the store.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:56.980
Unfortunately, we don't know his name because of those laws that protect children.

01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:00.980
But what he did, he used a permanent black marker to write,

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:07.980
PS3 sucks on 23 plastic security cases used to protect Sony PlayStation games from being stolen.

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.980
Of course, the Toys R Us employees caught him.

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:11.980
He was held until police arrived.

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:16.980
His parents were not able to be reached, so he was taken to child services.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:20.980
When he was asked why he did it by the police, he said, quote,

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:23.980
I have an Xbox and I hate PlayStation.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:28.980
I found the marker lying on the shelf and I guess I was bored. Sorry.

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.980
That's fantastic.

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:31.980
I guess I was bored.

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:34.980
I find it even better they couldn't find the stupid parents.

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.980
He was completely unsupervised.

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.980
Well, they were off doing crack, of course.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:39.980
And poorly raised.

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:41.980
They were off, you know, doing crack.

01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:45.980
They should be spayed and neutered.

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:48.980
Remember, spay and neuter your humans.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:52.980
Did you check the Olive Garden?

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.980
All right.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:54.980
That's it.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.980
Do you have anything, Loki?

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:04.980
No, but I wanted to see some of the stuff for Supernova 2.

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:08.980
I guess I'll have to get the PlayStation 2 game.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:10.980
Key word is get.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:14.980
DJ Kipples and Bits says, I guess he didn't have enough games to play on his 360.

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:16.980
Damn the summer game drought.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.980
No, no, you're heaven mistaken with the PlayStation 3.

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:21.980
Or the Wii.

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:22.980
Christ.

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:23.980
Well, there's plenty of games on the Wii.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.980
It's just none of them are any good.

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:28.980
By the way, and I don't know how this story did not make tonight's show roll,

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:31.980
but I swear to God I saw a story on it somewhere.

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:35.980
Dark Soccer, they have officially announced they're making a Cooking Mama 2.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:36.980
Squeeze.

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:37.980
Oh, that's right, because I didn't care.

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.980
That's why I wasn't on the show roll, because I was like, oh, Cooking Mama 2.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:42.980
Don't care.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.980
I still need to borrow yours, Rob, on the Wii.

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:46.980
I ain't playing it.

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:49.980
Yeah, Cooking Mama 2 in early 2008.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:53.980
505 Games has entered into agreement with Cooking Mama Limited

01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:58.980
to deliver Cooking Mama 2 for the DS and the Wii across Europe in early 2008.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.980
So I imagine it's just a matter of time.

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:04.980
I want it to be like a story-based game where, like,

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.980
you know, Cooking Mama's relative accidentally murders somebody

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:12.980
and they have to dispose of the body in, you know, creative culinary ways.

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:14.980
I think that would be pretty cool.

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.980
Mama will fix it.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:21.980
You know, Cooking Mama, I don't know.

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:23.980
Cooking Mama Massacre.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:24.980
Mafia.

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:25.980
Cooking Mama Vice City.

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:27.980
Cooking Mama Mafia Story.

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:31.980
No, it's Murdering Mama.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:32.980
Mama Fix Everything.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.980
Cooking Mama Soylent Green.

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.980
It's people.

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:38.980
No.

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:39.980
All right.

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.980
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.980
because we're about to wrap up the show.

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:44.980
So final thoughts.

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:45.980
Loki, your final thought.

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:50.980
My final thought is game publishers are coming out in a few weeks

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.980
and that makes me happy.

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:56.980
And my final thought is I still hate macaroni and cheese

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:57.980
with the powdered cheese.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:58.980
I love the powdered cheese.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.980
Cheese should not be in powder form.

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.980
That's disgusting.

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.980
Dark Soccer, your final thought.

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.980
That was it?

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:10.980
Freaking cookies.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:11.980
Cookies are great.

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:12.980
You know, I have more cookie dough.

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:13.980
I should make more cookies.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.980
Let's just eat the cookie dough, Rob.

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:15.980
No, that's disgusting.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:16.980
No, it's not.

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:17.980
It's great.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:18.980
You can get sick because of the raw eggs.

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:19.980
You know what?

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:20.980
What?

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.980
That's really an old wives' tale

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.980
because I used to work at a cookie place

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:28.980
and I used to take home the cookie dough.

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:33.980
Just because you didn't get sick does not mean you can't get sick.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:34.980
I know.

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.980
I have special not getting sick from cookie dough powder.

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:40.980
Special butter and sugar mix that protects you from the salmonella.

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.980
It lines your stomach.

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:45.980
Leave it to me to be the first person to die from eating cookie dough.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:46.980
All right.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.980
We're going to wrap it up, you guys, and call it a week.

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:52.980
Thank you guys so much for downloading and tuning into our podcast

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:54.980

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.980
We really appreciate it.

01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.980
You guys are awesome.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:00.980
Until next time, we'll see you here on Orange Lounge Radio next week

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:02.980
with episode number 243.

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:31.980
See you then.
