1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:06,154
[SPEAKER_00]: And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio here on this lovely Sunday evening, August the 5th of 2007.

2
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:10,838
[SPEAKER_00]: If you missed part A, our show is a little bit in limbo tonight, or a little bit broken.

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,000
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, we have no Jamie tonight.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,944
[SPEAKER_00]: She's unfortunately had a family emergency, so we all are of course thinking about her at this time.

5
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:22,328
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely we'll be seeing her next week after she's got all that taken care of.

6
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,550
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

7
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:40,128
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes forever.

8
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:44,129
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're here from the temporary Studio Loki and that's where we are tonight.

9
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you notice a lot of our usual sound effects are missing or we kind of sound different, that's a big reason why.

10
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:50,232
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're really excited about the new studio.

11
00:00:50,252 --> 00:00:51,853
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be so much more space than before.

12
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:58,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just worried about, it is a garage, it's an insulated garage, but I'm just worried about the heat issues.

13
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,237
[SPEAKER_00]: And the echo because it's got a bad echo problem too.

14
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:02,048
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.

15
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:03,549
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try and make it work by next week.

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,034
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping to pull through for you for episode number 242.

17
00:01:07,695 --> 00:01:09,678
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, let's get back into some gaming news.

18
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:13,082
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start off with some big news on the Xbox 360.

19
00:01:13,803 --> 00:01:15,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, big news on the Xbox 360.

20
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:19,751
[SPEAKER_00]: The $50 price break has been all but confirmed.

21
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:21,673
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:43,573
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to include Rockstar Table Tennis.

23
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:46,055
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a free game with it now, which is pretty awesome.

24
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:52,920
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if the game is really only $20 because Rockstar Table Tennis was cut down in price, that's better than no game at all, right?

25
00:01:54,121 --> 00:02:01,026
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true, and they're still denying that they have a price cut coming, but I think we know better than that.

26
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:04,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually Microsoft rumors end up to be true.

27
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:08,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and of course that's made its rounds all over the internet.

28
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:13,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Except that's not the only announcement coming this week.

29
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:29,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably by now, by the time you download this podcast, you will have heard that all the new 360 systems coming out as of this week and into infinity, I guess, will now all have HDMI.

30
00:02:30,643 --> 00:02:30,963
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

31
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:33,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have to spend the big bucks for the elite.

32
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:34,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the core.

33
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the core system will have HDMI.

34
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:50,440
[SPEAKER_01]: My theory of the core system, that's totally baseless, other than the fact that I just feel that not a lot of people are buying the core system, and there's some other stories that kind of collaborate that later in the show.

35
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute, so I don't understand how that works.

36
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:55,264
[SPEAKER_00]: What about all the systems that are already out there?

37
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:59,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to be coming off the shelves to make room for these HDMI-enabled machines, or what's going to happen?

38
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:06,550
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just they'll have this extra SKU out there, and I don't know, maybe they'll drop the price even more.

39
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:07,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh.

40
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:09,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.

41
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:11,788
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to have all HDMI on it.

42
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:19,093
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, is that to be competitive with PlayStation 3, or is that because too many people were bitching about the Elite is the only way to go to get that?

43
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:24,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you think about it, it's not a big surprise, because look at the Halo 3 system.

44
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:28,159
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's supposed to be coming out in September here.

45
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:29,520
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a big surprise.

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,522
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they haven't announced the price for that yet, if you think about it, because...

47
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:47,816
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people will be like, well, hey, you know, isn't that supposed to be, if they announced it at like $399 or something, or $349 or whatever, people will be like, hey, well, why would I want to buy a premium system like buy the Halo one for, you know, the same price with HDMI?

48
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:51,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Alex Silvara in chat has a very excellent point.

49
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:57,559
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking the same thing when I first heard this, is that, hmm, I need to figure out how to red ring my premium so I can get an HDMI model.

50
00:03:59,013 --> 00:03:59,373
[SPEAKER_00]: A hammer.

51
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:03,397
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but seriously, could you use that warranty to your advantage?

52
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:08,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Like somehow force your 360 to give you the red rings so when they send you a refurb, it has HDMI?

53
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:15,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you could wrap a towel around it and play it in an oven.

54
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:16,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to overheat it?

55
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Place it in an oven.

56
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:19,971
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

57
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:22,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened, Mr. Gates.

58
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not recommending that you do that, but I'm just saying.

59
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:32,336
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and this is not a real big deal because the systems out there right now, they don't have HDMI, but who cares?

60
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:40,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess it sucks if you already bought one, but for a person like me, I don't have any HDMI TV, I could care less.

61
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:43,882
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, is HDMI really that big a deal?

62
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:49,405
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because I have a feeling the internet's going to make this story this week sound like this big, huge freaking deal.

63
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:54,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing is that I'm guessing it will not have an HDMI cable with it either.

64
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:58,250
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason why is because there will be a cable that's coming out as well.

65
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,234
[SPEAKER_01]: All this is going to be, you'll probably all know this by the time you hear the podcast.

66
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:14,721
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, because also, of course, there was that GameStop thing, the leak to the internet that said, you know, the announcement's going to be made by the 8th or Wednesday.

67
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:18,223
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

68
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:19,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a big surprise, but...

69
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, this kind of supplements what Loki was saying earlier about possibly the core is going away completely.

70
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:33,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, Xbox, there's rumors going around that Microsoft has plans to make a hard disk drive a requirement to play games.

71
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:37,755
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, that, I think, one Sega game a little while back had a long time ago.

72
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,257
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start seeing them more games.

73
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,260
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on, yeah, Sega Pro Soccer or something or other.

74
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

75
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:44,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Some soccer...

76
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:51,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that the hard disk drive will actually be required for some later games.

77
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,966
[SPEAKER_00]: That was on the early pack shot, too, for Call of Duty 4.

78
00:05:55,527 --> 00:06:00,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you might remember that the original Xbox, they all had hard drives, and they would use the hard drive to their advantage.

79
00:06:00,989 --> 00:06:06,612
[SPEAKER_00]: It would take data off the disk, uncompress it, and then put it on the hard drive temporarily.

80
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:08,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, basically, the loading times are smaller.

81
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:14,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've ever played Oblivion without a hard drive versus with a hard drive, very similar type of concept there.

82
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:15,857
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

83
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:39,992
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know many Xbox 360 owners without a hard drive unless they are seriously only buying a 360 for Madden or only buying it for select games.

84
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:42,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very casual types of 360 gamers.

85
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:46,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Any, I think, hardcore gamer with a 360 probably has a hard drive.

86
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:56,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So, also this week, you know, that was pretty... Sorry, I just want to go chat really, really quick, because some good points here.

87
00:06:56,992 --> 00:07:03,797
[SPEAKER_00]: RossDLUT says, of course, Final Fantasy XI, another very big game that requires a hard drive on the Xbox 360, of course.

88
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:04,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

89
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:09,261
[SPEAKER_00]: WonderDogHerald would like to point out, HDMI is a big deal when you spend $2,000 on a TV.

90
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,704
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he bought a TV that was like $2,000.

91
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:14,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he did.

92
00:07:14,664 --> 00:07:15,225
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that.

93
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:19,006
[SPEAKER_00]: RavensDolphin says Orange Launch Radio enforces bricking Xbox 360s.

94
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:25,729
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we do not encourage you to brick your 360s because there's no guarantee you're going to get one replaced with HDMI.

95
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:29,910
[SPEAKER_00]: SonOfDad is being very bold and says, HDMI is a big deal for snobs.

96
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:37,113
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I'd like to mention, though, that Rockstar Table Tennis bundle that's out there,

97
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:38,045
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

98
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:00,304
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three different SKUs that they have.

99
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:26,692
[SPEAKER_01]: They have Rockstar's Table Tennis, Top Spin 2, which both of those have kind of leaked out on the internet now, and Amp 3 was the last one that they had that I didn't see anyone having that, but then again, the game's out of print also, so it wouldn't surprise me, though, if they had maybe Ridge Racer, that'd be kind of cool, but those three I know were being sold in January as well, so that's probably also why the one that they did leak with Top Spin 2, I think,

100
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:27,887
[SPEAKER_01]: had a price of $3.99.

101
00:08:50,716 --> 00:09:10,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is kind of interesting because you remember last week or two weeks ago we were here back here on the show we were talking about Halo on the DS we talked about like how Microsoft games could they really come out for the DS and I think even one of the emails are gonna get to later gets into this but it should be noted that at Comic-Con during a Viva Pinata panel of all things did you go to the Viva Pinata panel at Comic-Con?

102
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:11,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally didn't.

103
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:12,471
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured.

104
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:18,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare has actually announced they are going to be releasing a Nintendo DS version of Viva Pinata.

105
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:21,816
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of interesting there.

106
00:09:22,497 --> 00:09:24,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare is actually developing it themselves.

107
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,659
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a copy of the Xbox 360 game.

108
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:27,379
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.

109
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Gameplay-wise, they say it's the same game, but it is going to be a different game.

110
00:09:32,663 --> 00:09:40,630
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of interesting because that's weird because Rare is obviously a Microsoft subsidiary now and now they're putting out a game on the Nintendo DS.

111
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,532
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, it makes a lot of sense.

112
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:48,158
[SPEAKER_00]: If Xbox is not getting into the handheld realm anytime soon, lots of kids have Nintendo DSs.

113
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:52,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Viva Pinata is not just a game on the 360, but a cartoon series.

114
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:55,787
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to draw in the kids and make it a new Pokemon type thing.

115
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:56,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing I'm wondering.

116
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:59,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to be publishing this game?

117
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:00,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be Microsoft?

118
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:07,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that would be interesting if it's Microsoft publishing it, or if it's actually going to be Rare developing it and Nintendo publishing it.

119
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:09,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?

120
00:10:10,207 --> 00:10:10,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?

121
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:11,408
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it says here.

122
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,210
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it says.

123
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:19,515
[SPEAKER_00]: The article says it sounds like Microsoft is publishing it, but I don't think we know that for sure just yet, and I could be wrong, though.

124
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:36,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so another thing also that's very interesting and kind of a little weird, the new X and A package for PC, you might remember Microsoft's kind of game development kit,

125
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:41,462
[SPEAKER_01]: actually has support for Wiimotes, for inputs for using that.

126
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:48,567
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little interesting that you can make gesture-controlled games for Windows-based PCs.

127
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:56,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, so, I mean, because people with XNA can play these games that they make on their Xbox 360, correct?

128
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:57,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

129
00:10:58,093 --> 00:11:04,518
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in other words, people are going to be able, now they're going to have Viva Pinata on the DS, and they can build games that use the Wiimotes...

130
00:11:05,003 --> 00:11:05,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily.

131
00:11:05,663 --> 00:11:08,485
[SPEAKER_01]: They have different libraries for both the PC and the 360.

132
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:19,891
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to allow you to play Wii games or games that use the Wii Remote on your Xbox 360, but you can play them on your PC.

133
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that makes sense.

134
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:22,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was going to say, how can you plug in that infrared bar?

135
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:23,452
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.

136
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:27,935
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the Wiimote and the sensors that are in that, the accelerometers and all that.

137
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:31,797
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to plug in the bar anyways because it's just two infrared lights.

138
00:11:32,037 --> 00:11:32,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's true.

139
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:34,618
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still kind of interesting.

140
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:41,500
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have Bluetooth on it, so it'd be a little hard to connect those Wii remotes to the system.

141
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:45,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross Steel UT in our chatroom would like to point out Microsoft has published for DS before.

142
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:47,325
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a MechaSalt game for it.

143
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:49,066
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.

144
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:54,450
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ross Steel UT also says, this only proves that Microsoft is smart enough to stay the fuck away from the portable market.

145
00:11:55,063 --> 00:11:55,463
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

146
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:58,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Raven's Dolphin says it's a fair trade.

147
00:11:58,265 --> 00:12:00,186
[SPEAKER_00]: They get Viva Pinata and they get Wiimote.

148
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:10,252
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not – I mean to say Microsoft is getting the Wiimote, that's a little bit jumping to conclusions because I think it's – this is a very minor thing, and it's not like XNA games.

149
00:12:10,592 --> 00:12:16,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we've seen anything made in XNA actually go to the marketplace yet unless that – what about that – what was it?

150
00:12:17,056 --> 00:12:18,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Aegis Wing?

151
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:19,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that an XNA game?

152
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:20,598
[SPEAKER_00]: The one they give out for free?

153
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:20,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

154
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:21,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

155
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,822
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like the only one though that I can think of that actually has gone to life.

156
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:26,564
[SPEAKER_01]: There are more coming, it's just that's the first one.

157
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:31,469
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think you're going to just like see suddenly a random game that requires Wiimotes.

158
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:36,014
[SPEAKER_00]: For the exact reason that Loki brought up before, it's only really going to work on the PC.

159
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,371
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of interesting.

160
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's really no other word for it that I can think of.

161
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:43,455
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just interesting that these worlds are colliding like this.

162
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:45,437
[SPEAKER_00]: So, go figure.

163
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:47,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

164
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:51,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Also interesting is a release that's coming out in Japan.

165
00:12:51,722 --> 00:12:59,068
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting Japan all prepped for Halo 3 because, of course, Halo 3, you know it's going to be a big deal in this country, but in Japan, eh...

166
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:02,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it top the Amazon list at one point?

167
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:22,448
[SPEAKER_00]: for roughly the equivalent of $25 US is a history pack.

168
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:24,690
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Halo history pack.

169
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,231
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Halo and Halo 2.

170
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:36,678
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're releasing... Obviously, these were Xbox games, but they are going to release them in Japan, I guess, with discs that have built-in backwards compatibility updates on them.

171
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:40,240
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just can pop them in the Xbox 360s in Japan.

172
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,002
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the thought is that maybe this will get some hype going for Halo 3.

173
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:44,102
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

174
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,503
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

175
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not eating right now, so ha!

176
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:16,794
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done eating.

177
00:14:18,675 --> 00:14:25,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywho, there's going to be... Halo 3 pre-orders are everywhere, including 7-Eleven now.

178
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:36,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you can go buy a Slurpee or a Simpsons-themed item, and you can also pre-order Halo 3.

179
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:36,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

180
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:38,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

181
00:14:39,824 --> 00:14:40,084
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.

182
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:06,712
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just weird because you don't usually think of 7-Eleven as a place to go get your games.

183
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:09,973
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, if that's a nationwide thing, has that been confirmed to be nationwide?

184
00:15:10,513 --> 00:15:11,033
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?

185
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:11,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

186
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that franchise to franchise?

187
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:16,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think probably franchise to franchise.

188
00:15:17,235 --> 00:15:19,436
[SPEAKER_00]: If they did that around here, I might seriously consider it.

189
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:21,316
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who else is going to pre-order at freaking 7-Eleven?

190
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:24,117
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought 7-Eleven was a place to go play Street Fighter 2.

191
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,238
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Dark Knight says they sold Halo 2 at 7-Eleven too.

192
00:15:28,338 --> 00:15:31,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently a lot of people are forgetting about that.

193
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:38,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Bandit says, the week, and again, all these comments coming from our live chat room, chat.orangelantre.com.

194
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:42,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Bandit says, the week Halo 3 comes out, so many 7-Elevens are going to get robbed.

195
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,087
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of them.

196
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:49,089
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jvmon says, didn't 7-Eleven have the Wii price in a contest ad once?

197
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of, but that was a contest.

198
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Contests are different, I would think.

199
00:15:54,461 --> 00:16:09,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex Silvara says since they turned 7-Elevens into Quickie Marts maybe turn a few into Pillars of Autumn there you go turn them into some Halo themed stores there that could be interesting and expensive very expensive and ridiculous yeah it would be a little bit ridiculous where the hell am I

200
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:14,418
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a brand new Xbox 360 repair website.

201
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:27,648
[SPEAKER_00]: If you head on over in your browser in Internet Explorer or Firefox to service.xbox.com, there's a brand new site just set up pretty much to deal with the Red Rings of Death and other things related to Xbox 360 failures.

202
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:33,492
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all automated now, and it's probably to reduce the stress on those poor call center reps that have to take all your angry calls.

203
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:39,116
[SPEAKER_00]: You can register your console on the site, schedule the repairs, and keep track of them all through the website.

204
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:56,470
[SPEAKER_00]: And the site will also give you a $5 discount just in case your Xbox 360 is outside of warranty, like if it's not related to the Red Rings of Death or whatever, since I'm sure that's money that's being saved on the customer service end from not having to actually talk to you.

205
00:16:58,812 --> 00:17:02,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, $5 discount off of, like, what, $150 to repair that thing?

206
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:04,942
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little ridiculous.

207
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:09,805
[SPEAKER_01]: This is extremely sad news for me.

208
00:17:11,786 --> 00:17:15,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Grand Theft Auto 4 has been delayed to next year.

209
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:21,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot tell you the utter disappointment that I've had.

210
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:26,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I know at work, all of our Grand Theft Auto group, very disappointed.

211
00:17:28,193 --> 00:17:32,215
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess the reason was, it just wasn't done yet.

212
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:33,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Big game.

213
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:35,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to make sure it's perfect.

214
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,130
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just can't get done.

215
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:46,574
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but outside of you, the general consensus I'm feeling from the internet blogs and the internet websites is it's okay.

216
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:51,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have more time to play the other games that are all coming out this holiday season as well.

217
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's more Halo time.

218
00:17:52,997 --> 00:17:54,318
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more Mass Effect time.

219
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,919
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more, you know, whatever the hell you're playing.

220
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:58,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Metroid Prime, whatever.

221
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you've got to look at this, very interesting, though.

222
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:01,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean...

223
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:20,207
[SPEAKER_01]: This actually, I think, hurts Sony, because if you look at it, Sony for, you know, first party titles and stuff coming out in the fall, they had, like, Heavenly Sword, Lair, Ratchet and Clank Future, and, you know, I guess SingStar or not, Eye of Judgment, I mean...

224
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:23,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Those aren't... I mean, Heavenly Sword is going to be awesome.

225
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:25,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Lair is going to be pretty awesome.

226
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,131
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Ratchet & Clank, you know, definitely a good game.

227
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:30,773
[SPEAKER_01]: But those don't sell systems.

228
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:33,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Grand Theft Auto 4 would sell systems.

229
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:36,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's ridiculous because, yeah, it's coming out on the 360 as well.

230
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:41,918
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, you know, some people are Sony loyalists and they will buy their system when the game comes out.

231
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:46,760
[SPEAKER_00]: There really is something about that PlayStation name that is going to keep a lot of people with PlayStation.

232
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,520
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the thing.

233
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that it's not coming out...

234
00:18:49,901 --> 00:18:54,305
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to start thinking, hey, I just can't wait anymore.

235
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:57,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got Halo 3 coming out.

236
00:18:57,187 --> 00:19:01,731
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to sell even more now that there's nothing competing with it, at least around that same time.

237
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:05,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, Microsoft has a really strong lineup for the fall.

238
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:08,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, that's going to really hurt them.

239
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:24,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, granted, the game's gonna still sell like crazy when it comes out, because now there's gonna be nothing competing with it, but that's still more time and less units out there for Sony, and that's also more opportunity for them to lose even more exclusives if they can't have a good holiday season.

240
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:32,113
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the rumors that part of the reason of the delay is the PlayStation 3 development and that it's coding problems?

241
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:35,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just brought that up in chat, and also I remember reading that somewhere.

242
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:35,975
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.

243
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:38,697
[SPEAKER_00]: There's part of me that felt that that was a little bit fanboyish.

244
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know whether to believe it or not.

245
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,398
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's true or not.

246
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:51,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could see it because there are a lot of games lately from all different publishers and all different developers that have been delayed on the PlayStation 3 end because it is hard to develop for.

247
00:19:51,243 --> 00:19:52,083
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not used to it.

248
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:53,284
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used to developing for the 360.

249
00:19:54,684 --> 00:20:16,260
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know just developing for the sell is a lot harder so it's possible I don't think it's true but I just think the game is just not done it was a pretty aggressive deadline there they're trying to meet and you know they probably just want to make sure it's perfect because the game is going to be open to a crap load of scrutiny right hell yeah so especially from our very own Loki

250
00:20:18,162 --> 00:20:21,043
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, you know, that's not the only game to get delayed.

251
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:23,844
[SPEAKER_00]: I know probably not quite as many of you were looking forward to this.

252
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:30,087
[SPEAKER_00]: It's opened up to say that Blacksite Area 51, of course, Area 51 being one of their popular shooting games.

253
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:34,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this new Area 51 game was coming out on PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

254
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:40,352
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been bumped back to November 5th, which isn't a huge delay.

255
00:20:40,512 --> 00:20:44,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not like what we're looking at for the other games there, but it has been bumped back to November.

256
00:20:46,047 --> 00:20:49,710
[SPEAKER_01]: And funny enough, there's no demo for the PlayStation 3 yet on their service.

257
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was one supposed to be coming out later this month.

258
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:54,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly development issues.

259
00:20:56,314 --> 00:21:00,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another thing also, too, that we're forgetting about, and I'm going to cover this right now.

260
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:05,801
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another game delayed, Lair, which is supposed to be coming out actually next week.

261
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:07,142
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now coming out on September 4th.

262
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:31,356
[SPEAKER_01]: and the reason why it's being delayed is to enhance community features in the game because if you remember, Lair is going to be one of the first games that supports home in both their trophy system as well as being able to launch the game from home and stuff like that so some of these games also coming out in the fall may be delayed with some of those features in mind as well

263
00:21:33,303 --> 00:21:33,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

264
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:37,407
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't seem like that huge of a delay, though.

265
00:21:37,427 --> 00:21:39,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that really enough time to fix everything?

266
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:40,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it is.

267
00:21:41,511 --> 00:21:41,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh.

268
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:42,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Strange.

269
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:46,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, well, we're going to get into the mailbag.

270
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,881
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't delay that anymore.

271
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:52,043
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been two weeks coming, and we want to get to your emails and hear from some of you folks.

272
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:57,808
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, DarkSakura is not here tonight, but filling in tonight for the mailbag is the one and only Miklatov.

273
00:21:57,988 --> 00:21:58,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Me!

274
00:21:58,648 --> 00:21:59,088
[SPEAKER_00]: A.K.A.

275
00:21:59,128 --> 00:21:59,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane.

276
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:02,211
[SPEAKER_00]: So, unfortunately, we don't have the music tonight, so I'll sing.

277
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:03,692
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it goes.

278
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:05,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is the mailbag?

279
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:09,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, we're used to singing the song off-sync.

280
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:11,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, whatever.

281
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:12,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Get into the mailbag.

282
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:13,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Who emailed us this week?

283
00:22:14,235 --> 00:22:17,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first one is from Richard.

284
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:20,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say his last name because that might be inappropriate.

285
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:22,079
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use the last initial.

286
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:29,102
[SPEAKER_02]: M. The letter M. It says, hey guys, I just felt like saying hi because you guys are so cool.

287
00:22:29,662 --> 00:22:31,703
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a real bummer you didn't have a show last week.

288
00:22:32,358 --> 00:22:33,859
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like it's been longer though.

289
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:38,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I just found my Golden Sun game and was wondering did you ever like playing it?

290
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:41,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it seriously, to me, lacks the information giving.

291
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:45,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning it doesn't always let me know where I need to go or do.

292
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:48,885
[SPEAKER_02]: And is the new Tales of game for PSP any good?

293
00:22:48,905 --> 00:22:51,686
[SPEAKER_02]: And I already said who it was by, so I'm not going to say it again.

294
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:54,811
[SPEAKER_02]: and he needs to learn how to use commas because he used them incorrectly.

295
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, it's just like having Jamie here.

296
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane's complaining about the grammar of the emails.

297
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:00,494
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amazing.

298
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:01,995
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

299
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:03,697
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't know a lot.

300
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,378
[SPEAKER_00]: I played the crap out of Golden Sun.

301
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:06,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then you answer that.

302
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:13,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it up until I put it down for two days and he's dead on where it doesn't tell you what you're supposed to do ever.

303
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:20,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So putting it down for two days meant I couldn't play it anymore because I forgot what I was doing and there was nothing to help me figure out what I was doing.

304
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:24,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for the internet, and I don't think I really used the internet much at that time when it came out.

305
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:28,810
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's a great game if you remember what you're doing or keep track of it.

306
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:30,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anything about a Tales game.

307
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:32,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, do you know anything about a Tales game?

308
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:40,915
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a Tales game... There's a new Tales game I know coming out.

309
00:23:41,315 --> 00:23:42,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard too much about it, though.

310
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:47,725
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try to read up on it very quickly while you read the next email.

311
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:48,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how long this is.

312
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:49,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I have to read it all?

313
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:50,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just read it.

314
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:55,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is from Scott L. Wait, crap, he has like a pseudonym at the bottom.

315
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:56,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll just wait till that.

316
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:58,189
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not from Scott L at all.

317
00:24:04,515 --> 00:24:11,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Yet Again was listening to this week's Part B and had a couple of responses.

318
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:11,221
1.

319
00:24:12,682 --> 00:24:15,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a 360 break on me with the disc scratching problem.

320
00:24:16,145 --> 00:24:23,071
[SPEAKER_02]: This was one day after I bought it and had originally set it up on my coffee table while I made sure I had everything set up correctly. 2.

321
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:32,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it was running smoothly, I gently picked it up to move it onto my entertainment center, and next thing I knew, I heard a horrible loud grinding sound.

322
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:40,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I had only lifted it about an inch off the table, and had lifted it gently without tilting it at all.

323
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It not only ruined my disc, but when I put it

324
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:47,323
[SPEAKER_02]: When I put another disc in it, I don't want to read this anymore.

325
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:50,826
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really long and boring.

326
00:24:50,886 --> 00:24:55,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the gist of what he's saying is it scratched that disc as well once he put another one in to test it.

327
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And he learns his error of his ways.

328
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:01,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

329
00:25:01,353 --> 00:25:03,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't move the system while it's on.

330
00:25:05,616 --> 00:25:08,859
[SPEAKER_02]: He says it was near the system's launch and he had no idea it would happen.

331
00:25:09,928 --> 00:25:38,648
[SPEAKER_02]: he has had lots of machines that uses disks from PS1 on as well as PCs and I've never had this happen before when I moved them he got a replacement and things have been smooth sailing at first but he wanted to let everyone know that the disk scratching problem is a blatant fault in the 360 hardware and can happen with the slightest movement it doesn't require shaking or tilting it even though it sounds like any sort of jostling just picking it up is enough to break it

332
00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:40,850
[SPEAKER_02]: MechaSoul and Age of Empires Halo Halo

333
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:01,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers, y'all.

334
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Hero antagonist.

335
00:26:03,691 --> 00:26:05,893
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the worst email reader ever.

336
00:26:05,993 --> 00:26:07,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see how long this is, though?

337
00:26:08,014 --> 00:26:09,795
[SPEAKER_02]: We just kept going on and on.

338
00:26:09,815 --> 00:26:10,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Then summarize.

339
00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:11,516
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.

340
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:12,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried.

341
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:18,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly, the chat room has some comments here about where we did not know much about the Tales of series.

342
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:19,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Our chat room fills in here.

343
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:24,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex Silvara says, Tales of the World, Radiant Mythology for the PSP.

344
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:26,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply, it's awesome.

345
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

346
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:28,073
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the game that came out.

347
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:32,080
[SPEAKER_00]: And Zappy says the PSP Tales of is a fan service for Tales of fan.

348
00:26:33,362 --> 00:26:33,743
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

349
00:26:34,404 --> 00:26:34,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

350
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:39,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email is from Reesimo.

351
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:50,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, I've been a faithful listener for about a year and a half now.

352
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:57,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in the chat room a few times, but I'm often too busy to listen to you live, so I just download the podcast to my PSP.

353
00:26:58,455 --> 00:27:05,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the three of you offer so much to the gaming community and find it sad that many gamers that listen to podcasts haven't heard of you.

354
00:27:07,731 --> 00:27:08,311
[SPEAKER_02]: The end!

355
00:27:09,812 --> 00:27:10,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, keep going.

356
00:27:11,472 --> 00:27:15,314
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the extreme sarcasm and angst that Jamie offers.

357
00:27:15,774 --> 00:27:17,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt's rants are incredibly entertaining.

358
00:27:18,075 --> 00:27:20,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rob is just too fracking adorable.

359
00:27:21,776 --> 00:27:24,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're moving... Oh, the word was fucking?

360
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:25,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the word, Shane?

361
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:26,658
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more, there's more.

362
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm adorable.

363
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,101
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

364
00:27:30,742 --> 00:27:35,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're moving the studio soon and just wanted to know about any possible changes.

365
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hope you guys add video.

366
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:39,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Please consider it.

367
00:27:39,294 --> 00:27:41,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, I agree with you on the zapper.

368
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:44,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Just try to homosexual your anger a little.

369
00:27:45,442 --> 00:27:47,445
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what that means.

370
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:11,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Sound Voyager for the GBA Unfortunately, it's an import only from Japan, but since it's handheld, it's region-free

371
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:40,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I've not played the game, but according to reviews, it's supposedly more enjoyable to play this game with your eyes closed.

372
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:46,634
[SPEAKER_02]: If you or anyone else is interested, now is a good time to pick it up from PlayAsia because it's on sale for $15.

373
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:49,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, those are all the bit generation games.

374
00:28:50,036 --> 00:28:51,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought one of them, which I didn't like.

375
00:28:51,877 --> 00:28:52,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound Voyager?

376
00:28:52,678 --> 00:28:53,538
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't Sound Voyager.

377
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:56,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw... But, I mean, that's one of the bit generation ones.

378
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's one of them.

379
00:28:57,241 --> 00:28:58,982
[SPEAKER_01]: It's generation two, I think, but...

380
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:02,647
[SPEAKER_01]: They're awesome games for the Game Boy Advance.

381
00:29:02,787 --> 00:29:04,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be careful.

382
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,334
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one I got Colorists or whatever that's not very fun.

383
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:08,476
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really know how to play it.

384
00:29:09,337 --> 00:29:10,920
[SPEAKER_01]: It ends with hope this helps some people out.

385
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Apollo.

386
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:13,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

387
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:15,010
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good email.

388
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,391
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a happy email.

389
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:22,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike the one that was just complimenting you or the guy that writes too much.

390
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:24,556
[SPEAKER_00]: You're rude.

391
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:27,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, if you want to send an email, we promise Jamie will be back next week.

392
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:29,559
[SPEAKER_02]: She's just as mean as I am.

393
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio.

394
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:33,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're going to have Loki read them.

395
00:29:33,182 --> 00:29:33,942
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a little nicer.

396
00:29:34,062 --> 00:29:36,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Who can we get in here that's nice to the listeners?

397
00:29:36,204 --> 00:29:36,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm nice.

398
00:29:37,264 --> 00:29:41,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Not when you have to write a whole crap about stuff that's not interesting.

399
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

400
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:48,010
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it looks like homosexual your anger might be the new catch line.

401
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,091
[SPEAKER_00]: I started something worse.

402
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:52,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what?

403
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:53,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Than what you had before.

404
00:29:55,072 --> 00:30:00,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand how the last one makes sense, what you guys said, but I don't understand how this one makes even more sense.

405
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:07,095
[SPEAKER_00]: It had something to do... It was that week that the game, we speculated, we didn't know that the word was spastic.

406
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:13,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Some video game had the word spastic in it, and we speculated that the word was retarded, because we didn't realize the cultural differences.

407
00:30:13,257 --> 00:30:13,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't...

408
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,358
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

409
00:30:42,964 --> 00:30:43,764
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

410
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Laura Roslin Talk a little more about sports games

411
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:27,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that whole you're an asshole thing we were talking about earlier?

412
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:28,634
[SPEAKER_00]: I like winning 11.

413
00:31:29,294 --> 00:31:29,754
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.

414
00:31:30,294 --> 00:31:30,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you go.

415
00:31:30,794 --> 00:31:34,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like Major League Baseball Power Pros?

416
00:31:35,655 --> 00:31:37,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the Konami game.

417
00:31:37,335 --> 00:31:38,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's Konami and 2K Sports.

418
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:39,715
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes this interesting.

419
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:41,636
[SPEAKER_00]: The two of them are actually teaming up to put out this game.

420
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:42,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what system is it for?

421
00:31:44,376 --> 00:31:47,877
[SPEAKER_00]: It is coming out for... That's a very good question.

422
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:48,637
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten there yet.

423
00:31:48,877 --> 00:31:50,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, Nintendo Wii and something like that.

424
00:31:50,437 --> 00:31:52,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I totally saw that in the office.

425
00:31:52,718 --> 00:31:53,418
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked awesome.

426
00:31:54,418 --> 00:31:55,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you even allowed to tell us that?

427
00:31:55,878 --> 00:31:57,039
[SPEAKER_02]: What office is left?

428
00:31:57,259 --> 00:31:57,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

429
00:31:58,959 --> 00:31:59,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.

430
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us more?

431
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,701
[SPEAKER_02]: It was adorable because everybody had big heads and big eyes.

432
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:08,082
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was pretty cool.

433
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:08,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

434
00:32:09,142 --> 00:32:10,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw people playing it.

435
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the press release boasts that there's a dozen different game modes in the game.

436
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:16,345
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have long-term playability.

437
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:18,746
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll have, of course, a season mode, as most sports games do.

438
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Success mode, as well.

439
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:24,047
[SPEAKER_00]: In season mode, you become a Major League Baseball team general manager.

440
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,488
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, what is the ultimate goal?

441
00:32:25,768 --> 00:32:26,969
[SPEAKER_00]: To win the World Series.

442
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:31,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Success mode, though, has more traditional role-playing elements and other baseball scenarios in it.

443
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,932
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're calling this mode unique and compelling, which, you know, of course, press releases.

444
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:38,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's either of those, but it did look like a lot of fun.

445
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:41,334
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would highly recommend it if you like baseball games.

446
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:42,374
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it's really about.

447
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:44,685
[SPEAKER_02]: to some people.

448
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:46,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be the graphics, that's for sure.

449
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:53,928
[SPEAKER_00]: See, and now there's people in chat going, no, don't talk about sports games, or Raven's Dolphin says, Sky talking baseball makes me want to go kill myself.

450
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:56,249
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going to baseball games.

451
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:58,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying the games are kind of boring as of late.

452
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,391
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cheapy and cute.

453
00:32:59,511 --> 00:32:59,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean...

454
00:33:00,431 --> 00:33:01,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Even I love baseball stars on the internet.

455
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:05,633
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the occasional sports game that I will... Like the Ken Griffey games were really fun on the Super Nintendo.

456
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:06,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like Double Dribble.

457
00:33:06,574 --> 00:33:07,774
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you not love NBA Jam?

458
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:08,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

459
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:12,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but... You know, just because you don't play Madden doesn't mean you have to hate all sports games.

460
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:12,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's true.

461
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:16,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Madden is just a little hardcore for maybe some people that don't follow football.

462
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:17,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a bit much.

463
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:20,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Football's fun to watch, but it's not... I don't understand it.

464
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:22,140
[SPEAKER_00]: If you play racing games, that's a sport.

465
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:22,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

466
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:25,502
[SPEAKER_02]: They tried to make DDR a sport, guys.

467
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:26,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

468
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:28,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a whole nother, you know...

469
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:30,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Sports games can be good.

470
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:36,906
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, if you like baseball and you don't mind cute little things, it's going to be good.

471
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:48,429
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that may be good if you're holding out for All-Pro Football 2K8, apparently sales of All-Pro Football 2K8 were...

472
00:33:50,635 --> 00:33:51,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I guess.

473
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:58,237
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess 2K was not terribly pleased and not terribly disappointed.

474
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:04,318
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the rumor is that it may be dropping price with the upcoming Madden release.

475
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:11,140
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if it's going to drop price, that would probably be by next week then, since, well, that's when Madden comes out.

476
00:34:12,694 --> 00:34:13,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, looks pretty cool.

477
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:27,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I did see some funny videos though online of OJ Simpson and there was this one team, I can't remember what it was, but they had a, one of their mascots was this guy with a knife and he was stabbing.

478
00:34:28,423 --> 00:34:32,925
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny, so the fun things you can do with all pro football.

479
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:37,968
[SPEAKER_00]: OL Army Ninja in chat says, you guess a lot, Loki.

480
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:38,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

481
00:34:40,968 --> 00:34:42,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Smash Bros.

482
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:42,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Brawl

483
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:08,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Smash Bros.

484
00:35:08,428 --> 00:35:08,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Melee

485
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:32,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a quote from the story.

486
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:34,189
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really something you won't see anywhere else.

487
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:02,514
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds kind of cool, because it sounds like it could be something that's almost by itself.

488
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:03,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Go figure.

489
00:36:04,975 --> 00:36:08,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I want to say really quickly, though, because I noticed it didn't make the show roll.

490
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:10,576
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other information that hit the Smash Bros.

491
00:36:10,616 --> 00:36:13,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Dojo this week at SmashBrothers.com, and that is another newcomer.

492
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:14,677
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Ike.

493
00:36:15,357 --> 00:36:20,739
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ike you may have never heard of before, unless you play Fire Emblem, because Ike comes from the Fire Emblem series.

494
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:24,720
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes from, I think, the GameCube one, which probably sold about five copies.

495
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:25,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Well...

496
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, whatever you feel about Fire Emblem, Ike is going to be one of the characters in the game.

497
00:36:30,603 --> 00:36:33,284
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a character you'd have a crush on, Miklatov.

498
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally do, because he's got blue hair.

499
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:41,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hopefully the Wii version is going to sell a little bit more, because they do have the Wii one coming out in November here.

500
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:45,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Loki, I have a question for you, because Shane's going to yell at me if I say this.

501
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:47,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, is his hair blue or purple?

502
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:52,371
[SPEAKER_01]: From here, it looks kind of dark blue.

503
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, your eyes suck.

504
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:56,114
[SPEAKER_00]: It's purple to me.

505
00:36:57,155 --> 00:36:58,536
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this inside.

506
00:36:58,556 --> 00:36:59,357
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even a joke.

507
00:36:59,377 --> 00:36:59,557
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.

508
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:00,138
[SPEAKER_00]: It's indigo.

509
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:00,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear his hair is purple.

510
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll fight you for it.

511
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:10,582
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a little, it's bluey purple.

512
00:37:10,602 --> 00:37:14,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll tell you, well, I don't know.

513
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:27,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Another interesting thing, we've talked about this numerous times before, but the Neo Geo is coming to the Virtual Console, and now it is confirmed on Nintendo's Virtual Console website in Japan.

514
00:37:27,874 --> 00:37:34,519
[SPEAKER_01]: They do show the Neo Geo there, and also have a spot for another console that's yet unnamed.

515
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:40,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Dreamcast, Commodore 64, MSX There's also Elevator Action, which is now called Spy Game Elevator Action

516
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,341
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gross.

517
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:02,741
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's true.

518
00:38:29,841 --> 00:38:31,942
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no games that you get that super excited about.

519
00:38:33,323 --> 00:38:34,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Silent Hill.

520
00:38:34,184 --> 00:38:34,524
[SPEAKER_00]: See?

521
00:38:34,804 --> 00:38:35,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Pump It Up.

522
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:35,985
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gross.

523
00:38:36,546 --> 00:38:37,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, both of those games are amazing.

524
00:38:37,907 --> 00:38:41,649
[SPEAKER_01]: You did see that there's a new Pump It Up coming again to PSP.

525
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:45,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually was talking to Rob about that today and I wanted to cry.

526
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:49,435
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was making fun of him because the game will probably have his favorite pump song of all time in it.

527
00:38:49,575 --> 00:38:51,936
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably will and it's really going to make me sad.

528
00:38:52,057 --> 00:38:53,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Which for the record is Lizenka.

529
00:38:53,377 --> 00:38:53,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

530
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,081
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you like any of these songs.

531
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:59,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe Guitar Hero 3 will make you feel better, Miklatov.

532
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:01,947
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one song on there that does make me feel better.

533
00:39:02,187 --> 00:39:03,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm curious to know what it is.

534
00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:07,093
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some new songs that were just announced.

535
00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:08,514
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it seems like...

536
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:17,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever there's a new Guitar Heroes game, whether it's the 80s edition or the 30s, it seems like the songs keep slowly rolling out to keep this game in the press.

537
00:39:18,502 --> 00:39:20,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you no or yes when you read off the list.

538
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:32,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Murder by A.I., Threes and Sevens by Queen of the Stone Age, Raining Blood by Stare, Reptilia by The Strokes, Paranoid by Black Sabbath, Cities on Flame by Blue Oyster Cult, Mississippi Queen by Mountain.

539
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:33,654
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't read enough.

540
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:33,995
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

541
00:39:34,035 --> 00:39:35,136
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the seven new songs.

542
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:36,557
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's another new one.

543
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:37,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear.

544
00:39:37,938 --> 00:39:42,042
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a dragon in there which they showed the- That video was crazy.

545
00:39:42,723 --> 00:39:43,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the fire and flames.

546
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:44,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

547
00:39:44,565 --> 00:39:45,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

548
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:46,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.

549
00:39:47,648 --> 00:39:51,192
[SPEAKER_01]: It does remind me of stuff you'd see in like Guitar Freaks and stuff.

550
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:51,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

551
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Just insanely fast.

552
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:55,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Made no sense really.

553
00:39:55,336 --> 00:39:57,278
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, oh my god.

554
00:39:58,098 --> 00:40:00,019
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Cherub Rock by the Smashing Pumpkins.

555
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:00,859
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like it would be cool.

556
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:02,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones.

557
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,020
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of awesome.

558
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Sabotage by Beastie Boys.

559
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:07,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this might be tenacious D songs in there.

560
00:40:08,282 --> 00:40:09,622
[SPEAKER_00]: My Name is Jonas by Weezer.

561
00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:12,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still thinking that Rock Band is going to outdo this.

562
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:13,803
[SPEAKER_02]: From everything I understand about them two.

563
00:40:13,843 --> 00:40:16,865
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably buy them both because I'm such a whore for music games.

564
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:18,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

565
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:21,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen footage of Guitar Hero 3 since Neversoft took it over?

566
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:21,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

567
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:22,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks kind of weird.

568
00:40:22,847 --> 00:40:23,347
[SPEAKER_00]: It's alright.

569
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:26,750
[SPEAKER_00]: DDR looked kind of weird when it went over to the Xbox, but you get used to it.

570
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,951
[SPEAKER_00]: It still kind of looks weird.

571
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:32,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how you can give us a more honest opinion now.

572
00:40:33,995 --> 00:40:37,117
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I ever was not honest about how I felt about the game.

573
00:40:37,137 --> 00:40:39,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane, what do you think about DDR Hottest Party?

574
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a piece of crap.

575
00:40:46,191 --> 00:40:47,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.

576
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:49,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm way too honest.

577
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:52,719
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably ought to move on to the next topic, Loki.

578
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:56,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, speaking of weird and kind of crappy...

579
00:40:58,103 --> 00:40:59,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar Hero.

580
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:01,445
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been spotted in the arcade.

581
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:07,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, they had a wonderful shot of it on Kotaku.

582
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:11,469
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a game in a Bangkok arcade.

583
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,291
[SPEAKER_01]: What's funny about it is there's no guitar.

584
00:41:14,511 --> 00:41:15,231
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just Guitar Hero.

585
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:19,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you giggling at him talking about a game in Bangkok if you don't have a perverted mind, Shane?

586
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:21,094
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not laughing at that.

587
00:41:21,134 --> 00:41:21,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you later.

588
00:41:22,094 --> 00:41:23,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Go on with your story.

589
00:41:24,211 --> 00:41:26,872
[SPEAKER_01]: What's funny though is the whole game looks like poppin' music.

590
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:35,056
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got basically giant buttons for each of the fret buttons and I guess you play it a little bit like poppin' music.

591
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:42,619
[SPEAKER_01]: One might say though it's kind of ripping off of Beatmania so that's kind of ironic.

592
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:48,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So all you do is you just hit the buttons down and that's like an automatic strumming too?

593
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but it would just be poppin' music.

594
00:41:51,826 --> 00:41:53,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just saying it's poppin' music.

595
00:41:54,148 --> 00:41:54,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Poppin' Hero.

596
00:41:56,169 --> 00:41:57,430
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a terrible name.

597
00:41:57,971 --> 00:42:00,413
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a popcorn game.

598
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:03,075
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I just want to point out, this is what Shane's doing during the show.

599
00:42:03,115 --> 00:42:04,376
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why he started laughing?

600
00:42:05,116 --> 00:42:06,918
[SPEAKER_00]: It had nothing to do with the whole Bangkok thing.

601
00:42:07,218 --> 00:42:12,362
[SPEAKER_00]: He's reading Big Brother 8 live updates and giggling at them and the housemates calling each other dirty names.

602
00:42:13,002 --> 00:42:15,365
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what really goes on here in the OLR studio.

603
00:42:15,925 --> 00:42:17,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, don't get off topic.

604
00:42:17,687 --> 00:42:19,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Continue with your video games discussion.

605
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:20,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay, I will.

606
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:24,153
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you play Guitar Hero in the arcade if it was like poppin' music?

607
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:27,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I may try it once just to say that I played it, and that's about it.

608
00:42:27,617 --> 00:42:28,738
[SPEAKER_00]: I like poppin' in the arcade.

609
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:29,339
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be fun.

610
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:30,079
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be cool.

611
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's like playing Unjama Lamy in the arcade, which I played one time.

612
00:42:34,784 --> 00:42:35,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Unjama Lamy.

613
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:36,546
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very strange.

614
00:42:37,812 --> 00:42:41,956
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, it's made for little kids, so I had to get on my knees to play this game.

615
00:42:42,677 --> 00:42:43,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut up!

616
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:52,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm really tall, unlike little Asian girls, and I had to squat down to play.

617
00:42:53,486 --> 00:42:54,808
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind, I'm not going to finish the story.

618
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:58,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it like trying to use a little kid urinal or something like that?

619
00:42:58,751 --> 00:43:01,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they did in Billy Madison, where he has to squat down and he falls over?

620
00:43:06,195 --> 00:43:06,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

621
00:43:07,195 --> 00:43:08,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross Steel UT says you hit the buttons.

622
00:43:08,915 --> 00:43:10,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that every fucking rhythm game ever?

623
00:43:11,616 --> 00:43:12,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Kinda.

624
00:43:12,476 --> 00:43:16,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit them with your feet, hit them with your hands, hit them with the strumming, hit them with your voice.

625
00:43:17,277 --> 00:43:19,038
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't hit buttons with your voice.

626
00:43:19,238 --> 00:43:21,058
[SPEAKER_00]: You can if you sing really bad.

627
00:43:22,478 --> 00:43:24,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say my voice pushes people's buttons.

628
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:30,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Dead Air

629
00:43:45,246 --> 00:43:46,246
[SPEAKER_00]: That rumbles.

630
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:52,069
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we've been hearing this story on and off, and Loki has been insisting for weeks and weeks that yes, this is coming.

631
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:57,350
[SPEAKER_00]: But apparently, various Sony developers do have their hands on the 6-axis with rumble.

632
00:43:57,691 --> 00:44:04,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Rumor is it could be their big announcement at the convention in Germany, the Leipzig convention.

633
00:44:04,473 --> 00:44:07,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations for spending $499 on your brand new 60-gig PlayStation 3 system.

634
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, congratulations, you're now going to have to buy new controllers.

635
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:13,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

636
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:15,903
[SPEAKER_01]: What's also funny is they actually did come out.

637
00:44:16,243 --> 00:44:16,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?

638
00:44:16,524 --> 00:44:18,205
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing happened on PS1 and PS2.

639
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:18,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

640
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:19,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait.

641
00:44:19,966 --> 00:44:22,808
[SPEAKER_02]: But they didn't say Rumble is last generation then.

642
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:26,771
[SPEAKER_00]: PS1 didn't have the little analog sticks.

643
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:28,052
[SPEAKER_00]: PS2 didn't have Rumble to begin with.

644
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:29,553
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a PS2 controller that doesn't have Rumble.

645
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:29,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

646
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:30,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

647
00:44:31,094 --> 00:44:33,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear they had... I bought mine at launch.

648
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:33,855
[SPEAKER_00]: They had it at launch.

649
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:36,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Then why the fuck doesn't my PlayStation 2 controller rumble?

650
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:37,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it broken?

651
00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:37,836
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

652
00:44:37,856 --> 00:44:41,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you sure it's a PlayStation 2 controller?

653
00:44:41,116 --> 00:44:41,536
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.

654
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,837
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be just an... A black PS1 controller?

655
00:44:43,857 --> 00:44:44,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they had those.

656
00:44:44,837 --> 00:44:45,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they?

657
00:44:46,057 --> 00:44:46,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Son of a bitch.

658
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:49,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I remember I bought mine at launch and it worked.

659
00:44:49,278 --> 00:44:50,598
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, God.

660
00:44:50,658 --> 00:44:51,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I failed, Jesus.

661
00:44:51,738 --> 00:44:57,720
[SPEAKER_01]: I do remember, though, having to buy the DualShock controllers at one time, so yeah, that makes sense.

662
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:58,500
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

663
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:03,461
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is something that they took away and now they're putting back.

664
00:45:03,822 --> 00:45:07,763
[SPEAKER_02]: But they said they justified taking it away because it was a last generation feature.

665
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:08,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

666
00:45:08,943 --> 00:45:10,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Rumble is so last gen.

667
00:45:10,564 --> 00:45:11,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to last gen, Sony.

668
00:45:12,824 --> 00:45:15,885
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all, well, last gen sold better than this gen, so let's go back.

669
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:18,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what they're doing.

670
00:45:18,246 --> 00:45:21,027
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, maybe if we can just make it like the PS2, it'll sell.

671
00:45:21,047 --> 00:45:24,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

672
00:45:24,048 --> 00:45:24,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

673
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:29,945
[SPEAKER_01]: So, another interesting thing, Warhawk is finally, the price point has been announced.

674
00:45:30,906 --> 00:45:40,068
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew before that the retail version was going to be $59.99, and that was going to include a Bluetooth headset, as well as some extra bonus behind-the-scenes crap.

675
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:48,310
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the online version, probably the most expensive download I think you'll ever see on a console, well, so far at least.

676
00:45:49,236 --> 00:45:52,760
[SPEAKER_01]: is $39.99 to download this game.

677
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:55,122
[SPEAKER_00]: You thought Luminous was expensive.

678
00:45:56,824 --> 00:46:04,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, if you add it up, if you add up the game itself and then all the fucking little packs they have with it, maybe it's getting close.

679
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:04,691
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably about $25.

680
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:07,054
[SPEAKER_01]: That's before we even get to packs.

681
00:46:07,274 --> 00:46:10,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what makes you think that Warhawk's not going to have downloadable content?

682
00:46:10,717 --> 00:46:11,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point, good point.

683
00:46:13,263 --> 00:46:14,564
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so are you going to buy this, though?

684
00:46:14,824 --> 00:46:14,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.

685
00:46:15,345 --> 00:46:15,485
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

686
00:46:16,305 --> 00:46:19,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not like online-only multiplayer games.

687
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:21,189
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.

688
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:22,330
[SPEAKER_00]: No more MMOs?

689
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,832
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what turned me off to... MMOs are different.

690
00:46:24,872 --> 00:46:29,535
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just like straight, you know, online-only multiplayer.

691
00:46:29,675 --> 00:46:31,357
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like half a game to me.

692
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:39,883
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like taking the online portion of your single-player first-person shooter and just, well, we didn't feel like creating this story, so let's just make the game.

693
00:46:40,481 --> 00:46:49,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the chat room is all like saying, you know, and I appreciate the chat room and their comments, but they're all like, Sky, have you turned on the rumble and the various games?

694
00:46:50,631 --> 00:46:52,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a little credit here, people.

695
00:46:52,813 --> 00:46:57,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, okay, I've been doing an internet radio program about video games with my friends for five years.

696
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:05,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, give me a little bit of the benefit of the doubt that I know how to turn these features on in games and check and see, you know, all this stuff.

697
00:47:06,586 --> 00:47:09,950
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize I'm not perfect, and I don't get things right all the time.

698
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,032
[SPEAKER_00]: We're human, but please.

699
00:47:12,173 --> 00:47:15,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to remember if yours even has the little button in the middle to turn on.

700
00:47:15,837 --> 00:47:16,157
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.

701
00:47:18,408 --> 00:47:19,168
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back, folks.

702
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:19,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.

703
00:47:19,948 --> 00:47:21,129
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what happened.

704
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:22,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you what happened.

705
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:24,990
[SPEAKER_00]: This Skype mess with the settings there.

706
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, live radio, boys and girls.

707
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,390
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the temporary studio.

708
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:27,970
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you do?

709
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,231
[SPEAKER_00]: These things happen.

710
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:32,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't know what the last thing the folks heard was, though, before we went to the Skype line.

711
00:47:32,591 --> 00:47:34,912
[SPEAKER_00]: So quickly give us the last story again real quick there.

712
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:35,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, folks.

713
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:36,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Live radio.

714
00:47:36,372 --> 00:47:36,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Things happen.

715
00:47:36,952 --> 00:47:37,713
[SPEAKER_01]: The last story?

716
00:47:37,993 --> 00:47:38,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Like which story?

717
00:47:39,654 --> 00:47:40,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Story about the start of the read?

718
00:47:41,175 --> 00:47:41,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

719
00:47:42,836 --> 00:47:49,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, anyways, so we were going to cover one story that we ran on the website about the Tokyo Game Show list for Sega.

720
00:47:50,939 --> 00:47:52,100
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me sad.

721
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,721
[SPEAKER_01]: And that looks really awesome.

722
00:47:53,821 --> 00:47:55,462
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a wonderful list.

723
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:57,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Even like Fighters Megamix 2 and stuff.

724
00:47:57,604 --> 00:47:58,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, hell yeah.

725
00:47:58,504 --> 00:48:00,025
[SPEAKER_02]: New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio.

726
00:48:00,065 --> 00:48:02,447
[SPEAKER_01]: New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio, yeah.

727
00:48:02,507 --> 00:48:02,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

728
00:48:02,827 --> 00:48:03,548
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fake.

729
00:48:04,308 --> 00:48:08,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was too much of a Sega fanboy's dream.

730
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:10,352
[SPEAKER_00]: And we posted that on our website.

731
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:11,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome job.

732
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:12,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome job, everybody.

733
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how did it get debunked?

734
00:48:15,031 --> 00:48:18,673
[SPEAKER_01]: The original source actually has posted a retraction and apology.

735
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:24,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Saying, we lied because we made all of those up because people wanted to hear that.

736
00:48:25,015 --> 00:48:27,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so they are a big douche, apparently.

737
00:48:27,757 --> 00:48:28,117
[SPEAKER_01]: It says...

738
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:38,856
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been a lot of controversy regarding the recently posted rumor regarding Sega's possible Tokyo Game Show lineup.

739
00:48:39,337 --> 00:48:55,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I was originally very defensive of this piece, and because of who sent it in, his longtime go-to guy named Rob has sent me exclusive tips of four years, and until this most recent one, all were accurate.

740
00:48:57,547 --> 00:49:10,238
[SPEAKER_01]: and apparently Rob says sorry guys says that I'm sorry for this whole AMS I assure you that this is not this will not happen again I have to say I applaud you guys for being right on top of this

741
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:12,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

742
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:16,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I think really some of those games sounded plausible up until you hit Shenmue 3.

743
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you one thing, though, that will be a Tokyo Game Show this year.

744
00:49:21,922 --> 00:49:23,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can get excited about this or not.

745
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

746
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:29,543
[SPEAKER_01]: But a new Sonic Riders game, Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, will be there.

747
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:31,384
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out on the Wii and PlayStation 2.

748
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, around the same time as the first one came out last year.

749
00:49:35,425 --> 00:49:35,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Around...

750
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:39,062
[SPEAKER_01]: February, I believe.

751
00:49:39,082 --> 00:49:45,685
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was a new version of Sonic R with the same awesome music, maybe I'd care, but... Yeah, it's just not.

752
00:49:46,165 --> 00:49:50,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Riders was okay, it was an alright game, but... I don't know.

753
00:49:51,027 --> 00:49:51,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Put this away.

754
00:49:51,727 --> 00:49:54,509
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it controls better than Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3 and 360.

755
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:56,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fine with that.

756
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:59,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that's a burn right there, because that game sucks.

757
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:02,945
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I'm very sorry, guys.

758
00:50:02,965 --> 00:50:04,626
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be able to do the Skype line tonight.

759
00:50:04,706 --> 00:50:10,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Live radio and things are broken and it's not running at the same time as our recording software does.

760
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,310
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's okay.

761
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:12,411
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll bring it back next week.

762
00:50:12,991 --> 00:50:14,833
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take more calls next week to make up for it.

763
00:50:14,873 --> 00:50:17,114
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will do some Ask Orange Lounge tonight.

764
00:50:17,134 --> 00:50:18,615
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have our chat room is still working.

765
00:50:18,635 --> 00:50:20,036
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can interact with us through that.

766
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:20,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

767
00:50:39,107 --> 00:50:42,908
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably go in there and adjust it so that it's lined in and stuff.

768
00:50:43,068 --> 00:50:43,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

769
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:45,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you even try?

770
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:45,950
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

771
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:50,472
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, let's just... Do we really want to break the show further tonight?

772
00:50:50,552 --> 00:50:50,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah!

773
00:50:51,592 --> 00:50:53,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Might as well go all or nothing.

774
00:50:53,473 --> 00:50:54,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go all the way, man.

775
00:50:54,414 --> 00:50:55,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's break the show.

776
00:50:56,055 --> 00:50:56,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

777
00:50:56,575 --> 00:50:59,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are some comments in chat about the whole Sega thing going on.

778
00:51:00,177 --> 00:51:03,238
[SPEAKER_00]: RossDLUT says, Sega doesn't know how to make good games anymore.

779
00:51:03,298 --> 00:51:04,759
[SPEAKER_00]: How could you not know this was fake?

780
00:51:06,235 --> 00:51:08,677
[SPEAKER_00]: They do ruin all their franchises they touch lately.

781
00:51:08,697 --> 00:51:12,160
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if you looked at that list, that's a huge fucking list.

782
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's no way they're working on that much.

783
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:17,564
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that was missing from it was like Panzer Dragoon Saga 2.

784
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:18,825
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

785
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:20,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else is like, fanboy.

786
00:51:23,276 --> 00:51:24,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see.

787
00:51:26,538 --> 00:51:28,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Raven's Dolphin says, no Skype.

788
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:30,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, OLR is having my kind of failure.

789
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:31,121
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

790
00:51:31,242 --> 00:51:33,863
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkTetsuya said they should make a new Jet Set Radio for the Wii anyway.

791
00:51:34,203 --> 00:51:35,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for the Wii, make it for the 360.

792
00:51:36,445 --> 00:51:38,386
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkTetsuya says, or hell, a new Samba de Amigo.

793
00:51:38,606 --> 00:51:38,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

794
00:51:39,147 --> 00:51:40,528
[SPEAKER_00]: I found my Samba stuff.

795
00:51:40,548 --> 00:51:41,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I saw them.

796
00:51:41,468 --> 00:51:45,491
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that they had a Samba de Amigo listed as a PSP title on it?

797
00:51:45,511 --> 00:51:47,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what are you going to do, shake your stupid PSP?

798
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:48,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh!

799
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:49,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

800
00:51:49,353 --> 00:51:49,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

801
00:52:07,714 --> 00:52:12,156
[SPEAKER_00]: So we promised we'd do some Ask Orange Lounge, so I'm going to read some questions here from our chat room.

802
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:14,497
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, we don't have the theme music unless Shane wants to sing it.

803
00:52:14,877 --> 00:52:16,317
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the theme music?

804
00:52:16,357 --> 00:52:19,079
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as the mailbag music, because we're cheap here on this program.

805
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:19,879
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you.

806
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:22,660
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

807
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with this.

808
00:52:24,101 --> 00:52:26,121
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a stupid question indeed.

809
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:27,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's from Raven's Dolphin.

810
00:52:28,002 --> 00:52:30,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it as you will.

811
00:52:31,306 --> 00:52:34,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Raven's Dolphin says, Sky, how come you do not talk about your iBook?

812
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:35,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I got a MacBook and like it.

813
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:39,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing with it, so he can't talk about it.

814
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:40,696
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my iBook.

815
00:52:41,556 --> 00:52:45,801
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only internet I have right now because that's how I'm able to steal the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

816
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:48,320
[SPEAKER_00]: The screensaver is really pretty.

817
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:50,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can choose from several different screensavers.

818
00:52:50,562 --> 00:52:51,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're aware.

819
00:52:52,243 --> 00:52:54,185
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's much more to the Mac than just the screensaver.

820
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:54,665
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt it.

821
00:52:55,445 --> 00:52:55,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

822
00:52:55,886 --> 00:53:00,089
[SPEAKER_02]: There's being able to play WoW on it, but very badly because I can't fly down.

823
00:53:00,489 --> 00:53:04,392
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, who does a lot of work on the road and who travels a lot, it's great.

824
00:53:05,072 --> 00:53:07,054
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Mac for that stuff.

825
00:53:07,234 --> 00:53:09,616
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a great DVD authoring program on it.

826
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:10,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give it that.

827
00:53:11,697 --> 00:53:12,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to some more questions.

828
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:15,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Ask Orange Lounge tonight in lieu of the Skype line.

829
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:18,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we do not have the Skype line tonight.

830
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:21,553
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Janai asks, how was moving last week?

831
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:26,957
[SPEAKER_00]: It was long and tedious, and I'm very glad to be done with it.

832
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,340
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new house that I live in is so much better than the apartment I was in before.

833
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:37,125
[SPEAKER_00]: With no disrespect to Extifer, because living with Extifer was fun, but just the place itself is so much better now.

834
00:53:37,145 --> 00:53:39,627
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a house, there's actually a backyard and a lawn to mow.

835
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:40,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex Silvara

836
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:10,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone like the Dynasty Samurai Warriors series besides me?

837
00:54:11,078 --> 00:54:14,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I did hear there's a new incarnation coming out on Xbox 360.

838
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:21,433
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna be doing Dynasty Warriors Gundam, that's coming out in August.

839
00:54:21,493 --> 00:54:28,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they've got that Warriors Orochi, which is coming out in September, which is pretty much Dynasty Warriors mixed with Samurai Warriors.

840
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:30,880
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, I couldn't tell the two apart.

841
00:54:31,661 --> 00:54:40,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's Dynasty Warriors 6, which actually looks like they did something with the series and made it look a little bit better on 360, so...

842
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:43,651
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

843
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:50,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Gameplay-wise, they haven't changed anything, but graphically, it looks like they haven't changed anything either, so... I don't know.

844
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much I could really be excited about.

845
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:55,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Although there is Samurai Warrior Katana later this year, so...

846
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:01,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Going over to a question from RossDLUT.

847
00:55:01,096 --> 00:55:04,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's actually a really good question and something that wasn't brought up earlier in the show.

848
00:55:04,557 --> 00:55:08,238
[SPEAKER_00]: With the recent raids on mod chippers, the internet's pretty much gone nuts.

849
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:13,680
[SPEAKER_00]: The question I have is, well, are people so selfish that they feel gamers shouldn't have to support game companies?

850
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I'd rather XSEED were able to make profits than have 500 pirates to every one importer.

851
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:22,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting point.

852
00:55:22,267 --> 00:55:27,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because there's been those raids going on apparently about all these people that will mod chip your systems.

853
00:55:27,128 --> 00:55:29,189
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very curious to hear what you think about this, Loki.

854
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:31,689
[SPEAKER_01]: About modding and stuff like that?

855
00:55:31,809 --> 00:55:33,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the crackdowns and all that?

856
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:45,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, what they're doing is violating the law, but at the same time, there's ways around things that you don't necessarily have to put a hardware mod chip into it in order to be able to play stuff from other countries.

857
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:47,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also the problem is...

858
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:57,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, with a lot of these things, you know, games are expensive now, don't get me wrong, but at the same time, you know, people are kind of jaded with paying 60 bucks and getting crap.

859
00:55:58,297 --> 00:56:09,123
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting hosed, and like, they kind of justify it in a way, well, fuck this, I wasted, you know, 60 bucks on Bomberman Act Zero, and I thought it was going to be a really awesome game, and it's just crap.

860
00:56:09,803 --> 00:56:11,885
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and now I can't get my money back, so...

861
00:56:12,805 --> 00:56:14,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you, I'm gonna steal your next game.

862
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:15,787
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's that.

863
00:56:16,227 --> 00:56:21,931
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also, you know, with importing, I don't understand why more systems are like the PlayStation 3 and the PSP.

864
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,114
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let people import their games if they want to.

865
00:56:25,194 --> 00:56:27,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, it sells an extra copy for you.

866
00:56:27,115 --> 00:56:28,556
[SPEAKER_01]: You still make some money off of it.

867
00:56:29,096 --> 00:56:30,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't think it's really hurting anything.

868
00:56:30,898 --> 00:56:33,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it's gonna be a Japanese version of the game or something.

869
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:34,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Big deal.

870
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:40,473
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the big scope of things, too, there's so few people that actually import in the big scope of gaming.

871
00:56:40,593 --> 00:56:42,534
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that big a deal, I don't think.

872
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:48,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, hell, how else did Elite Beat Agents get a release here but from people importing on and on?

873
00:56:48,597 --> 00:56:48,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

874
00:56:49,317 --> 00:56:49,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

875
00:56:49,938 --> 00:56:53,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, look, my buying... GS68 just said the same damn thing in chat.

876
00:56:55,861 --> 00:56:59,803
[SPEAKER_01]: My buying Wangan Midnight, that's a whole one extra copy for them, and you know why I bought it?

877
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:01,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's not a lot of stuff coming out over here.

878
00:57:02,404 --> 00:57:04,265
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what the hell?

879
00:57:06,492 --> 00:57:20,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, but as far as just like pirating to get a bunch of games for free, especially when you're downloading things like Halo 3 and Blue Dragon, you know, assumably when these games come out, Blue Dragon, kind of like this stuff, you know, you know it's not going to be like Barman X Heroes.

880
00:57:20,463 --> 00:57:21,083
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little different.

881
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:22,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put it this way.

882
00:57:22,624 --> 00:57:23,325
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not okay.

883
00:57:23,385 --> 00:57:24,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my PSP is modded.

884
00:57:24,726 --> 00:57:26,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I can play games without having to buy them.

885
00:57:26,988 --> 00:57:29,710
[SPEAKER_01]: But would I have bought those games if it wasn't modded?

886
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:30,731
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wouldn't have.

887
00:57:31,568 --> 00:57:34,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I just play games that are from other countries just to check them out.

888
00:57:34,971 --> 00:57:36,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I normally don't end up buying them.

889
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:40,656
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have felt bad if I actually bought them because they sucked.

890
00:57:41,016 --> 00:57:42,838
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also not like you don't buy video games.

891
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:46,661
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have a shitload of video games everywhere in this house, so you buy a lot of video games.

892
00:57:47,281 --> 00:57:49,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend a lot of money on video games, and you know what?

893
00:57:49,923 --> 00:57:56,489
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can play something for free instead of paying for it, yeah, I'll do it because it frees up more money for buying something else.

894
00:57:58,312 --> 00:58:00,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Legend of Zaku has this for Ask Orange Lounge.

895
00:58:01,036 --> 00:58:02,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring back the camera.

896
00:58:02,277 --> 00:58:04,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing back the webcam would be hot.

897
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,563
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it is going to happen in the new studio, but we're just not sure.

898
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,365
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, getting a webcam in there isn't a problem.

899
00:58:09,405 --> 00:58:11,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just about delivering it to the site.

900
00:58:11,147 --> 00:58:12,789
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will have more information on that later.

901
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:20,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we've seen the suggestions about, I don't know what, Justin TV, Operator 11, whatever site Travis Donovan's using.

902
00:58:21,295 --> 00:58:24,677
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking into what we want to use and we'll have more information on that later.

903
00:58:24,697 --> 00:58:27,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I even thought about doing something in here if we had time.

904
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:34,004
[SPEAKER_01]: So I buried the Xbox Vision camera because I haven't used it for anything yet.

905
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:35,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Something soon.

906
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:38,578
[SPEAKER_00]: We will definitely have a cam in the new studio because the new studio will be awesome.

907
00:58:38,979 --> 00:58:39,219
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope.

908
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:41,203
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it feel to be surrounded by grown gay men?

909
00:58:48,128 --> 00:58:49,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

910
00:58:49,668 --> 00:58:49,949
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

911
00:58:50,549 --> 00:58:51,429
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the big deal?

912
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:52,469
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

913
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:54,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Ban him.

914
00:58:54,369 --> 00:58:55,510
[SPEAKER_02]: He's homophobic.

915
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:57,570
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one that broke Gay Gamer.

916
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:01,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of which, what do you think about that whole GayGamer.net getting targeted?

917
00:59:01,231 --> 00:59:02,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt really sad.

918
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:05,431
[SPEAKER_02]: I met Flynn at Comic Con, and he's a really nice guy.

919
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:09,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody doing that to his site really kind of makes me mad.

920
00:59:09,272 --> 00:59:11,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if it was all this hate crime and stuff.

921
00:59:12,013 --> 00:59:13,833
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so gay that somebody would do that.

922
00:59:14,353 --> 00:59:19,401
[SPEAKER_00]: NM64 says, how few frames per second do you predict your current PC would get while playing Crysis?

923
00:59:29,301 --> 00:59:30,281
[SPEAKER_01]: I think mine would die.

924
00:59:30,642 --> 00:59:41,986
[SPEAKER_01]: As it is, shit, until I upgraded the video drivers, which I think they were current, but for some reason it was having issues because I installed like three different sets of video drivers that were all running concurrent.

925
00:59:42,006 --> 00:59:49,109
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ever since I did that, my computer before that was just resetting randomly.

926
00:59:49,229 --> 00:59:50,470
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just boop, stop.

927
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:51,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to have that problem.

928
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:54,211
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, fucking A, I'm going to have to buy another PC.

929
00:59:54,631 --> 00:59:58,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, though, this weekend, though, I bought a magazine because I'm actually looking to buy a new PC.

930
00:59:59,383 --> 01:00:28,372
[SPEAKER_01]: or BuildOne and unfortunately my dream PC is like $11,000 so I need to scale down quite a bit but they have a nice article this PC game or PC building bible they have build your own game PC under $1,400 and it looks nice and it's all blue I want an all blue PC somebody get me some paint I'll paint my PC and it'll be blue or Rob will say it's purple and try to trick me but it's not going to be it's going to be blue

931
01:00:29,537 --> 01:00:30,979
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a Commander Keen?

932
01:00:43,269 --> 01:00:44,089
[SPEAKER_00]: How old are you?

933
01:00:44,149 --> 01:00:45,150
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like a baby.

934
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:46,870
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't around for Commander Keen, were you?

935
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:52,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Commander Keen was kind of like, I don't know, like ID's Mario game for the PC.

936
01:00:52,772 --> 01:00:54,292
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how else to explain it, really.

937
01:00:54,412 --> 01:00:55,772
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a side-scrolling game.

938
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:57,713
[SPEAKER_00]: It had like crazy demons from hell?

939
01:00:58,253 --> 01:00:59,053
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so, no.

940
01:00:59,073 --> 01:00:59,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what's the point?

941
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:00,594
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fun, though.

942
01:01:00,614 --> 01:01:03,895
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks that had computers in the 90s remember this game.

943
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,455
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the shit on shareware.

944
01:01:05,987 --> 01:01:06,468
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

945
01:01:06,888 --> 01:01:07,429
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome.

946
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:08,650
[SPEAKER_01]: And all about Jasper Shakur.

947
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,714
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did not... I heard that name, but I don't know what it is.

948
01:01:11,874 --> 01:01:14,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard some of their other stuff was coming to Steam, but I didn't know the old stuff was.

949
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:18,322
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't freeware release that stuff a long time ago?

950
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:19,143
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

951
01:01:20,728 --> 01:01:21,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Epic MegaGames ZZT

952
01:01:36,912 --> 01:01:37,572
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you do?

953
01:01:37,592 --> 01:01:41,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I was such a nerd that I spent so many hours making games.

954
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:42,716
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your own games.

955
01:01:42,756 --> 01:01:44,677
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a programming language for games.

956
01:01:44,717 --> 01:01:46,618
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to explain.

957
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:48,400
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all using ASCII characters.

958
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,021
[SPEAKER_01]: So your games would be very blocky and stuff.

959
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:56,565
[SPEAKER_01]: But as it went on, they also released this new thing called MegaZooks where you can create your own.

960
01:01:56,585 --> 01:01:57,866
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a terrible name.

961
01:01:58,166 --> 01:02:01,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Your own games as well, but it was a little bit more intuitive.

962
01:02:01,087 --> 01:02:03,769
[SPEAKER_01]: They had, you know, ooh, mod music.

963
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:08,811
[SPEAKER_01]: You could, you know, mod tracker stuff in there and just all sorts of interesting things.

964
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:15,654
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say, like, years ago on this show, like, we had an entire three-hour conversation about ZZT one night.

965
01:02:15,714 --> 01:02:17,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's crazy.

966
01:02:17,515 --> 01:02:18,475
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an excellent idea.

967
01:02:18,515 --> 01:02:19,696
[SPEAKER_00]: What, OLR the ZZT?

968
01:02:20,116 --> 01:02:26,279
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a contest, a game design contest in ZZT sponsored by OLR.

969
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:28,486
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.

970
01:02:28,606 --> 01:02:32,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we'll work out the details and come up with that for a future program.

971
01:02:32,369 --> 01:02:33,330
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.

972
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there still ZZT programming communities?

973
01:02:34,911 --> 01:02:35,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we can find it.

974
01:02:35,612 --> 01:02:36,612
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gotta be somewhere.

975
01:02:37,693 --> 01:02:40,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Shadowslayer says, I swear this guy is making these games up.

976
01:02:40,776 --> 01:02:42,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on Wikipedia or something.

977
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:43,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making this shit up.

978
01:02:43,178 --> 01:02:44,098
[SPEAKER_00]: ZZT is a real game.

979
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:48,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Hitstun says, fuck the Unreal Engine, ZZT forever.

980
01:02:48,262 --> 01:02:48,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.

981
01:02:49,143 --> 01:02:51,104
[SPEAKER_00]: God, your listeners are old.

982
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:52,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut up.

983
01:02:56,437 --> 01:02:59,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you allow them to use SuperZZT or any of the other ZZT mods?

984
01:02:59,899 --> 01:03:01,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like SuperZZT.

985
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:05,141
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, we'd either do it in the original ZZT or we would do MegaZooks.

986
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:06,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Because MegaZooks was pretty awesome.

987
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:08,002
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a lot of cool shit in that.

988
01:03:08,122 --> 01:03:10,743
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have... I'm banging on the desk because I have a great idea.

989
01:03:10,783 --> 01:03:15,505
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one thing I've said I wanted to do for Orange Lounge in our new season, we'll use a new studio, is more interviews.

990
01:03:15,965 --> 01:03:19,247
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get people who made ZZT on the program.

991
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:20,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to talk about ZZT.

992
01:03:20,808 --> 01:03:22,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to talk about it.

993
01:03:23,089 --> 01:03:23,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Interview me.

994
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:27,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I wear a top hat and a monocle and a mustache so I can pretend I'm old.

995
01:03:28,642 --> 01:03:30,207
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pretend you're Colonel Mustard?

996
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:30,488
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

997
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:31,932
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't wear a top hat.

998
01:03:32,953 --> 01:03:34,214
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

999
01:04:02,893 --> 01:04:03,473
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1000
01:04:04,594 --> 01:04:06,155
[SPEAKER_00]: How old do you think he is?

1001
01:04:06,255 --> 01:04:09,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked me how black and white TV was back in the day.

1002
01:04:09,218 --> 01:04:14,401
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking, like, well, they used to show Dennis the Menace reruns on Nickelodeon in black and white, but that was about it.

1003
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:15,362
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know.

1004
01:04:15,422 --> 01:04:20,446
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a time, though, that I did have an old ass... It was a 286 system.

1005
01:04:20,466 --> 01:04:23,528
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a 28620 or something like that with the whole...

1006
01:04:24,568 --> 01:04:52,275
[SPEAKER_01]: 32 megs of hard drive space and anyways so there was one game we had because we had just these really budget ass games it was like a what was it a Muppets game or something like that and because it was on a black and white monitor you had to play it on like a CGA monitor or something like that which was you know four colors and they all sucked it was fucking hard to see it you couldn't see and you don't want to do the push a button or something so it just went blank screen finally one day we're like I think I see something on there and

1007
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we hit the button and then we found out, oh, look, the game sucks.

1008
01:04:56,971 --> 01:04:57,812
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, look at this.

1009
01:04:58,012 --> 01:05:03,053
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a screenshot from the town of ZZT featuring the bank of ZZT.

1010
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:04,014
[SPEAKER_01]: The bank of ZZT.

1011
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:10,596
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole program, that first, because you can play through, there's like this huge game and stuff that you can play through on there.

1012
01:05:11,156 --> 01:05:16,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the actual, the game that it came with was locked, so you couldn't edit it.

1013
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:20,259
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a program that you can hack the thing and actually unlock it.

1014
01:05:20,939 --> 01:05:24,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, the bank little program thing was kind of complicated.

1015
01:05:24,736 --> 01:05:25,540
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool looking.

1016
01:05:27,051 --> 01:05:27,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.

1017
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:35,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember my friends, we used to be real into Robotech and shit, and he would make Robotech ZZT levels and all sorts of weird stuff.

1018
01:05:35,436 --> 01:05:39,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, I remember Code Red, which was one of the add-on packs for ZZT.

1019
01:05:39,278 --> 01:05:42,920
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, this huge series somebody made for ZZT.

1020
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,941
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of really big series.

1021
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, god, back in the day, I used to be so into that stuff.

1022
01:05:48,243 --> 01:05:50,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we need to stop being so old.

1023
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:52,225
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk about this.

1024
01:05:53,045 --> 01:05:54,166
[SPEAKER_00]: What, you got something else real quick?

1025
01:05:54,306 --> 01:05:56,428
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I said we're gonna just keep talking about this if we don't.

1026
01:05:57,068 --> 01:05:58,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some last minute stories.

1027
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:59,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.

1028
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:00,310
[SPEAKER_01]: They're interesting.

1029
01:06:01,011 --> 01:06:07,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know if they're interesting, but we've got a picture of Big Brain Academy, the board game.

1030
01:06:08,717 --> 01:06:11,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Big Brain Academy on the DS.

1031
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:12,439
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be cool.

1032
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:18,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like it comes with your own, I don't know, crack scale?

1033
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:20,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's like a weird scale on there.

1034
01:06:22,448 --> 01:06:24,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's what that is, some sort of drug scale.

1035
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:27,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Train your brain to smoke more crack.

1036
01:06:28,574 --> 01:06:29,975
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of interesting.

1037
01:06:32,317 --> 01:06:34,439
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wii Remote's getting yet another strap.

1038
01:06:36,846 --> 01:06:37,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

1039
01:06:39,248 --> 01:06:40,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Hooray for straps!

1040
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:42,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up for straps, everybody!

1041
01:06:43,171 --> 01:06:43,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright!

1042
01:06:44,112 --> 01:06:45,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Those Wii remotes are strapped, yo!

1043
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:48,315
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got.

1044
01:06:49,015 --> 01:06:49,456
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

1045
01:06:49,656 --> 01:06:50,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, thank you.

1046
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:52,398
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but don't they have little clasps on them?

1047
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:55,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's straps with clasps on them.

1048
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:55,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

1049
01:06:56,121 --> 01:06:57,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo, upgrades.

1050
01:06:57,522 --> 01:06:59,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

1051
01:06:59,343 --> 01:07:03,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Jaden has a tip for you, Shane, if you want to experience what black and white TV was like.

1052
01:07:04,827 --> 01:07:09,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the color setting all the way down on your color TV and you'll have a black and white TV.

1053
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:10,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I do that?

1054
01:07:10,509 --> 01:07:12,390
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how to do that on my TV.

1055
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:15,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you wanted to know what watching black and white TV was like, so there you go.

1056
01:07:15,651 --> 01:07:17,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Or watch the Purple Network.

1057
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:22,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll flip you off.

1058
01:07:24,034 --> 01:07:25,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you didn't swear.

1059
01:07:25,095 --> 01:07:25,876
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not.

1060
01:07:25,956 --> 01:07:26,697
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my fingers.

1061
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:32,502
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember having an old-ass TV and trying to... I was like, ooh, I get 13 channels.

1062
01:07:32,542 --> 01:07:33,023
[SPEAKER_01]: That sucks.

1063
01:07:33,403 --> 01:07:35,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if I can tune anything on in UHF.

1064
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:37,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

1065
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:39,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I get one Spanish channel, and that's about it.

1066
01:07:41,619 --> 01:07:41,739
[SPEAKER_02]: NERD

1067
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:01,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

1068
01:08:02,231 --> 01:08:02,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate you.

1069
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:06,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we're going to wrap it up.

1070
01:08:06,293 --> 01:08:08,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me talk about something old and boring.

1071
01:08:09,235 --> 01:08:12,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts for tonight.

1072
01:08:12,897 --> 01:08:17,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane, thank you for being here and contributing your unique perspective to our program.

1073
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:18,460
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1074
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,521
[SPEAKER_00]: And your final thought, please.

1075
01:08:21,443 --> 01:08:26,525
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play the new expansion because it's blue and not purple, so shut up.

1076
01:08:27,886 --> 01:08:31,908
[SPEAKER_00]: My final thought is I want to go see a movie because...

1077
01:08:33,157 --> 01:08:33,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do.

1078
01:08:33,577 --> 01:08:34,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see Harrisburg.

1079
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:39,201
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see a movie because I'm sick of moving and unpacking boxes.

1080
01:08:39,401 --> 01:08:39,842
[SPEAKER_00]: So movie.

1081
01:08:40,342 --> 01:08:41,042
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll think about it.

1082
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:41,903
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.

1083
01:08:41,923 --> 01:08:42,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I will.

1084
01:08:42,864 --> 01:08:43,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, your final thought.

1085
01:08:44,505 --> 01:08:54,972
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is yet another last-minute story, and it was Nestor J, the NES emulator, just got released on the PSP version 1.11 RM.

1086
01:08:56,793 --> 01:09:07,916
[SPEAKER_01]: which means rewind and mirror mods so apparently this game has now become like Prince of Persia The Sands of Time where you can play like Super Mario Brothers and oh no I fucked up rewind that's pretty cool

1087
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, Nestor?

1088
01:09:09,856 --> 01:09:10,837
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a remix.

1089
01:09:10,957 --> 01:09:12,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Howard and Nestor?

1090
01:09:12,498 --> 01:09:15,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and also like the NES emulator on the PSP.

1091
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Or every other platform out there.

1092
01:09:19,222 --> 01:09:19,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

1093
01:09:20,343 --> 01:09:22,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you not get that reference because we're old?

1094
01:09:22,364 --> 01:09:23,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that.

1095
01:09:23,065 --> 01:09:25,306
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because I subscribed to Nintendo Power when I was little.

1096
01:09:25,586 --> 01:09:27,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have the first issue in a box somewhere.

1097
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:27,808
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all torn up.

1098
01:09:27,848 --> 01:09:29,329
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably don't anymore.

1099
01:09:29,409 --> 01:09:30,650
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember the Castlevania issue.

1100
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:34,172
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issue 6, or the last issue of the Nintendo Fan Club.

1101
01:09:34,652 --> 01:09:35,673
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what that is.

1102
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:36,574
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's before my time.

1103
01:09:36,614 --> 01:09:36,934
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.

1104
01:09:36,954 --> 01:09:37,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else.

1105
01:09:39,435 --> 01:09:40,035
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, guys.

1106
01:09:40,115 --> 01:09:43,376
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go now and call it a show.

1107
01:09:43,496 --> 01:09:44,516
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a great night.

1108
01:09:44,896 --> 01:09:47,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next week, go away.

1109
01:09:48,257 --> 01:09:49,237
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see you next time.

1110
01:09:49,557 --> 01:09:51,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for supporting Independent Radio.

1111
01:09:52,198 --> 01:10:02,660
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like the show, tell two friends about our show because that's how we get the word out because, of course, we don't – well, we're poor, so we can't exactly buy advertisements in magazines, so we rely on your word of mouth.

1112
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:08,321
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed what you heard or if you didn't enjoy what you hear, tell people how much we suck because we'll still get listeners that way.

1113
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:09,683
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll make ourselves feel good.

1114
01:10:10,103 --> 01:10:11,025
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.

1115
01:10:11,646 --> 01:10:12,627
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really, really it.

1116
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:13,709
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no outro tonight.

1117
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:16,013
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost all our music in the temporary studio, remember?

1118
01:10:16,293 --> 01:10:20,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge, blah, blah, blah.

1119
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,803
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to end it right here.

1120
01:10:23,845 --> 01:10:24,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night.
