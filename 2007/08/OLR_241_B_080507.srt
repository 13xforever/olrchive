00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
And welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio here on this lovely Sunday evening August the 5th of

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,580
2007 if you missed part a our show is a little bit in limbo tonight or a little bit broken first off

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,080
We have no Jamie tonight

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,320
She's unfortunately had a family emergency

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,420
so we all are of course thinking I'm about her at this time and and definitely we'll be seeing her next week after she's

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,940
got all that taken care of and

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,240
Also, we're in temporary studio

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,700
Obviously we weren't here last week because we were moving and we thought the new place would be up and running this week

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,760
However, the unfortunate thing is thanks to Comcast

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,940
We have no internet at the new place because you have to wait like two weeks to get an appointment if you're an existing customer

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,000
So it takes forever. So we're here from the temporary studio Loki and that's where we are tonight

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,280
So if you notice a lot of our usual sound effects are missing or we kind of sound different

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,240
That's a big reason why but we're really excited about the new studio

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,120
It's gonna be so much more space than before. I'm just worried about it is a garage

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,620
It's an insulated garage, but I'm just worried about the heat issues, but we'll worry and the echo

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,480
Cuz it's got a bad echo problem, too. We'll see we're gonna try and make it work by next week

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,140
So we're hoping to pull through for you for episode number 242 in the meantime

18
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:14,560
Let's get back into some gaming news and we're going to start off with some big news on the Xbox 360 big big news on

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,240
the Xbox 360

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,900
The $50 price break has been all but confirmed by Circuit City

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:28,440
Circuit City has put a brand new flyer out there that shows that there is a price drop on all the systems the elite coming down

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,720
To $449 the premium coming down to $349 and the core system coming down to $279

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,560
What should also be noted is that the premium system the three now $349.99 system is going to include

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,800
Rockstar table tennis so you get a free game with it now, which is pretty awesome

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,480
Even if the game is really only 20 bucks because Rockstar table tennis was cut down in price

26
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,760
That's better than no game at all, right?

27
00:01:52,760 --> 00:02:00,760
That is true, and they're still you know denying that they have a price cut coming, but I think we know better than that

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,600
Usually Microsoft rumors end up to be true. Yes, and of course you know that's made its rounds all over the internet

29
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,680
Except that's you know not the only announcement coming this week

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,640
Probably by now by the time you download this podcast you will have heard that all the new

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,760
360 systems coming out as of this week and

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,880
into infinity I guess

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Will now all have HDMI

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,520
so

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,360
Don't have to spend the big bucks for the elite even the core even the core system will have my theory of the core system

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,200
that's that's totally baseless other than the fact that I

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
Just feel that not a lot of people are buying the core system

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,880
And there's some other stories that kind of collaborate that later in the show wait a minute

39
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,200
So I don't understand how that works how what about all the systems that are already out there?

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,600
Are they gonna be coming off the shelves to make room for these HDMI enabled machines or what's gonna happen?

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:06,560
No, it's just they'll have this extra SKU out there, and I don't know maybe they'll drop the price even more

42
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,120
Huh very interesting so it's gonna have all HDMI on it so now

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,360
I was that to be competitive with PlayStation 3 or is that because too many people were bitching about the elites

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,440
Is the only way to go to get that I mean if you think about it's not a big surprise because look at the you know

45
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,560
halo

46
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,440
3 system I mean that's supposed to be coming out in

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,240
September here, and it's not a big surprise

48
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:34,240
That's why they haven't announced the price for that yet if you think about it because you know people be like well

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,680
Hey, you know isn't that supposed to if they announced it like 399 or something or 349 or whatever?

50
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,600
People say hey, why would I want to buy a premium system like buy the halo one for you know the same price with?

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,120
HDMI now Alex Silvara in chat has a very excellent point

52
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,840
I was thinking the same thing when I first heard this is that hmm

53
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,760
I need to figure out how to red-ring my premium so I can get an HDMI model a

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,240
hammer

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,000
No, but seriously like you know could you use that warranty to your advantage like somehow for sure 360 to give you the red rings

56
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,160
So when they send you a refurb it has HDMI

57
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,640
well, you could wrap a towel around it and

58
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,720
You know play it in another try to overheat it place it in an oven

59
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,880
No, but I don't know what I'm not recommending that you do that, but you know I'm just saying

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,320
And no one this is not a real big deal because you know the systems are out there right now

61
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,680
They don't have HDMI, but who cares I mean I guess

62
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,200
It sucks if you already bought one, but you know for like a person like me. I don't have any HDMI TV

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,760
I could care less so I know is HDMI really that big a deal

64
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,720
I mean because I have a feeling the Internet's gonna make this story this week and sound like this big huge

65
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,000
Frickin deal other thing is it I'm guessing it will not have an HDMI cable with it either

66
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,000
But the reason why is because there will be a cable. It's coming out as well all this is gonna be

67
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,080
You'll probably all know this by the time you hear the pod yes

68
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,720
So hmm you know because it also of course there was that GameStop thing the leak to the internet that said you know the

69
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,040
announcements gonna be made by the 8th or Wednesday, so

70
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,480
Yeah Wow not a big surprise, but

71
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,560
Well, you know this kind of supplements what Loki was saying earlier about possibly the core is going away completely

72
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,680
apparently

73
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:35,040
Xbox there's rumors going around that Microsoft has plans to make a hard disk drive a requirement to play games in other words that think

74
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,720
One Sega game a little while back had a long time ago. It was seeing a more game. It was on

75
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,720
Yeah, Sega Pro soccer or something or other out some soccer

76
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,120
Sim thing well that the hard disk drive will actually be required for some later games

77
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,280
That was on the early pack shot to for Call of Duty 4

78
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,720
They now you might remember that the original Xbox they all had hard drives

79
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,200
And they would use the hard drive to their advantage it would take data off the disk

80
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,580
Uncompress it and then put it on the HD H drive hard drive temporarily

81
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,840
And so basically the loading times are smaller

82
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,440
And if you've ever played oblivion without a hard drive versus with a hard drive very similar type of concept there of course no official

83
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,800
announcement announcement from Microsoft as of yet

84
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:25,120
But rumors are around and Microsoft rumors usually end up to be true usually unless it's like completely off-base

85
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,480
But I wouldn't see this as being completely off-base. I could I could see this being a reality yeah

86
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:30,960
I mean

87
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,200
I don't know many Xbox 360 owners without a hard drive unless they are seriously only

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,160
Buying a 360 for Madden or only buying it for select games

89
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:48,160
You know very very casual types of 360 gamers any I think hardcore gamer with a 360 probably has a hard drive. Yeah

90
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,880
So also this week you know that was very sorry

91
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,440
I just want to go chat really really quick because some good points here

92
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:04,120
Ross deal UT says of course Final Fantasy 11 another very big game that requires a hard drive on the Xbox 360 of course hello

93
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,200
I wonder doc Harold would like to point out HDMI is a big deal when you spend $2,000 on the TV

94
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,320
Raving he bought a TV that was like $2,000

95
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,000
Ravens dolphin says orange on its radio enforces bricking Xbox 360s

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,240
No

97
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,640
We do not encourage you to break your 360s because there's no guarantee you're gonna get one replaced with HDMI

98
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,800
Son of dad is being very bold says HDMI is a big deal for snobs

99
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:37,080
Hmm the other thing I'd like to mention though that table Rockstar table tennis bundle. That's out there

100
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,680
It's not the first time we've seen that actually

101
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,820
Around January of this year. There's a few retailers out there

102
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,640
This was offered to retailers as a way to sell systems, and it wasn't the only one fact

103
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,000
I double-checked it on the ad that I saw and the part numbers match exactly so

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,240
There's three different skews that they have they have Rockstar's table tennis top spin to

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,600
Which both of those have kind of leaked out on the internet now and amp 3 was the last one that they had that

106
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,600
I didn't see anyone having that but then again the games out of print also, so

107
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,520
It wouldn't surprise me though if they maybe Ridge Racer. That'd be kind of cool

108
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,440
But those three I know were being sold in January as well

109
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,520
So that's probably also why that the one that they did leak with top spin to I think

110
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,320
Had a price of $3.99

111
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,080
Because that's the old skew um and and three those kind of an old game though

112
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,960
I mean it is see that being super popular it is, but I mean top spin to I mean I'm not really

113
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Tennis yay

114
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,520
Top spin game wasn't even that great topspin to wasn't even that great. I do like really games

115
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
I didn't like that one, so sorry to say

116
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,120
Now this is kind of interesting because you remember last week or two weeks ago

117
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,600
We were here back back here on the show we were talking about halo on the DS

118
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,120
We talked about like how Microsoft games could they really come out for the DS

119
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,640
And I think even one of the emails are gonna get to later gets into this

120
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,720
But it should be noted that at comic-con during a viva pinata panel of both things all things

121
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Did you go to the viva pinata panel at comic-con?

122
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:17,200
She totally didn't I figured rare has actually announced. They are going to be releasing a Nintendo DS version of viva pinata

123
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,240
So kind of interesting they're rare is actually developing it developing it themselves

124
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,880
It's not a copy of the Xbox 360 game. It's different

125
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,240
Gameplay wise they say it's the same game, but it is going to be a different game

126
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,200
So kind of interesting because that's weird because rare is obviously a Microsoft subsidiary now

127
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,960
And now they're putting out a game on the Nintendo DS

128
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:44,200
But at the same time it makes a lot of sense if Xbox is not getting into the handheld realm anytime soon lots of kids

129
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,320
Have Nintendo DS's and viva pinata of course is not just a game on the 360, but a cartoon series

130
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,200
So you know they're trying to draw in the kids and make it like a new Pokemon type thing so I'm wondering who's my who's

131
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,040
Gonna be publishing this game is it gonna be Microsoft because that would be interesting if it's Microsoft

132
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,040
Publishing it or if it's actually gonna be rare developing it and Nintendo publishing it

133
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,160
Who knows?

134
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,400
Who knows I don't think it says here. I go. I guess it says the the

135
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,560
Article says it sounds like Microsoft is publishing it, but I don't think we know that for sure just yet

136
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,560
And I could be wrong though

137
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Anyways

138
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:30,200
So another thing also that's very interesting kind of little weird the new X&A package for PC

139
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,560
You might remember Microsoft's kind of game development kit

140
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,600
Actually has support for Wiimotes for inputs for using that

141
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,880
So that's a little interesting that you can make gestured controlled games for windows-based

142
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,840
PCs

143
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,720
Wait so I mean because people with XNA can play these games that they make on their Xbox 360 correct

144
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,160
Yeah, so in other words people are gonna be able now

145
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,680
They're gonna have viva vignette on the DS and they can build games that use the wiimotes not necessarily

146
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:09,720
They have different libraries for both the PC and the 360 so it's not gonna allow you to play

147
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
You know Wii games are like, you know

148
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,920
Games that use the Wii remote on your Xbox 360, but you can play them on your PC

149
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,040
Oh, that makes sense because I was gonna say how can you plug in that infrared bar?

150
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,680
You can't it just it's just the wiimote and the sensors that are in that the accelerometers

151
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,960
No, I really need to plug in the bar anyways, because it's just two infrared lights. I guess that's true

152
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,880
That's still kind of interesting, but it doesn't have bluetooth on it

153
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,600
So, you know, it'd be a little hard to connect those we remotes to the system

154
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,360
Ross deal UT in our chairwoman like to point out Microsoft is published for DS before there was a mech assault game for it

155
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,080
So there you go and Ross do UT also says this only proves that Microsoft is smart enough to stay the fuck away from the portable

156
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Market, there you go

157
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,240
Ravens dolphin says it's a fair trade

158
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,120
They get viva pinata and they get wiimote but that's not I mean to say Microsoft is getting the wiimote

159
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:07,400
That's that's a little bit jumping to conclusions because I think it's this is a very minor thing and it's not like XNA games

160
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,240
I don't think we've seen anything made in XNA actually go to the marketplace yet unless that what about that?

161
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,280
What was it a Aegis wing? Was that an XNA game the one they give out for free? Yeah

162
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,200
So that's like the only one though that I can think of that actually is coming

163
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,520
It's just that's the first one, but I don't think you're gonna just like see suddenly a random game that requires wiimotes

164
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,240
For the exact reason the Loki brought up before it's only really gonna work on the PC

165
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,880
It's just kind of interesting. I mean, there's really no other word for it that I can think of

166
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,520
It's just interesting that these worlds are colliding like this

167
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,720
So go figure

168
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:49,640
Let's see also interesting is a release that's coming out in Japan. It's getting Japan

169
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:55,480
All prepped for halo 3 because of course halo 3, you know, it's gonna be a big deal in this country, but in Japan

170
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,480
You know, I haven't taught the Amazon list at one point

171
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,880
I think I think it's I think it is doing pretty well in Japan. It's doing it's doing well over there

172
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,640
But it's not quite I mean, it's not quite the phenomenon that it is over here. You know what I mean?

173
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,600
Like, you know, we'll get in some other stuff regarding halo 3 later

174
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,960
That's kind of weird

175
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,320
But we should say this that what is coming out in Japan for roughly the equivalent of 25 years

176
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,640
US is a history pack. It's the halo history pack. It's halo and halo 2

177
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,080
And they're releasing obviously these were xbox games

178
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,960
But they are gonna release them in Japan, I guess with discs that have built-in backwards compatibility updates on them. So

179
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,320
You can just can pop them in the xbox 360s in Japan

180
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,880
And I guess the thought is that maybe this will you know get some hype going for halo 3 so

181
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,920
Kind of interesting that this is coming out but pretty cool a really a really good deal

182
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,040
I think the games are more expensive over here still I think halo 3 still set you back or halo 2

183
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,480
Still set you back at least 30 bucks or at least 20 bucks each. I think at least so not a bad deal

184
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,000
It's still a good deal. I wouldn't be surprised if we see something like that over here. I don't know why they wouldn't but whatever

185
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,760
What is very weird by the way, they can all hear you eating on the stream right now

186
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,240
Very professional. All right. Well, I'm not eating right now. So, huh. I'm done eating

187
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,320
Anywho there's gonna be

188
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,760
Halo 3 pre-orders are like everywhere including 7-eleven now. Yes, you can go buy a

189
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Slurpee or I guess a a

190
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,160
You know simpson themed item and you can also pre-order halo 3

191
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,320
Why well where there's money to be made. I mean you don't think of 7-eleven as being a big

192
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,000
Video game sales chain, but let's face it. I mean lots of people want to buy halo 3

193
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,680
Not everybody's gonna want to deal with the crowds at Best Buy or GameStop or whatever. So why not 7-eleven?

194
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,200
I mean why if they can turn a profit from bringing a small amount of video games into their store? Why not? Right?

195
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I guess

196
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,240
It's just weird because you don't usually think of 7-eleven as a place to go get your games

197
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,240
But honestly if that's a nationwide thing is having confirmed to be nationwide. What's going on?

198
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
I don't know franchise to franchise

199
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,480
I would think probably franchise the franchise but um, they did that around here. I might seriously consider it

200
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,520
I mean who else is gonna pre-order it freaking I always thought 7-eleven is a place to go play street fighter 2

201
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,040
DJ dark knight says they sold halo 2 at 7-eleven 2 apparently a lot of people are

202
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Forgetting about that

203
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Bandit says the weekend again all these comments coming from our live chat room chat dot orange launch rate calm

204
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Bandit says the week halo 3 comes out so many 7-elevens are gonna get robbed

205
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
so many of them

206
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,040
And JV Mon says didn't 7-eleven have the Wii price and a contest ad once

207
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,040
Sorta, but that was a contest contests are different. I would think hmm

208
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,040
Um, alex selvara says since they turned 7-elevens into quickie marts, maybe turn a few into pillars of autumn

209
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,040
There you go. Turn them into some halo themed stores there. That could be a interesting and expensive

210
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,040
Very expensive and ridiculous. Yeah, it would be a little bit ridiculous. Where the hell am I?

211
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Uh, there's a brand new xbox 360 repair website

212
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,040
If you had your on over in your browser in internet explorer or firefox to service dot xbox

213
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:22,040
dot com. There's a brand new site just set up pretty much to deal with the red rings of death and other things

214
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Related to xbox 360 failures

215
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,040
It's all automated now and it's probably to reduce the stress on those poor call center reps

216
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,040
I have to take all your angry calls

217
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,040
You can register your console on the site schedule the repairs and keep track of them all through the website and the site

218
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Will also give you a five dollar discount just in case your xbox 360 is outside of warranty

219
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:48,040
Like if it's not related to the red rings of death or whatever, um, since i'm sure that's money that's being saved

220
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,040
On the customer service end from not having to actually talk to you

221
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Whoo five dollar discount off of like 150 bucks to repair that thing. That's a little ridiculous

222
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,040
This is extremely sad news for me

223
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Um, grand theft auto 4 has been delayed to next year

224
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,040
I I cannot tell you the utter disappointment that i've had. Um

225
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:24,040
I know at work all of our grand theft auto group very disappointed

226
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,040
But I guess the reason was just wasn't done yet

227
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,040
Big game want to make sure it's you know, perfect

228
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:38,040
And they just can't get done. So, you know, but uh outside of you the general consensus

229
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,040
I'm feeling from the internet blogs and the internet websites is it's okay

230
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:48,040
Now we have more time to play the other games that are all coming out this holiday season as well. Like it's more halo time

231
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:54,040
It's more mass effect time. It's more, you know, whatever the hell you're playing netroid prime, whatever

232
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
Now if you gotta look at this very interesting though

233
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,040
I mean this actually I think hurts sony because if you look at it sony for you know

234
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:08,040
First party titles and stuff coming out in the fall. They had like heavenly sword lair

235
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,040
um ratchet and clank future and

236
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:18,040
You know, I guess sing star or not. I have judgment. I mean those aren't I mean heavenly sword

237
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,040
It's gonna be awesome and lair is gonna be pretty awesome and then ratchet and clank

238
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:28,040
You know, definitely a good game, but those don't sell systems grand theft auto 4 would sell systems

239
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,040
And I know it's ridiculous because yeah, it's coming out in the 360 as well

240
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:38,040
But still, you know, some people are sony loyalists and they will buy their system when there really is something about that

241
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,040
PlayStation name that is going to keep a lot of people with playstation, but here's the thing now that it's not coming out

242
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,040
People are going to start thinking hey

243
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:52,040
You know, I just can't wait anymore and you know now you've got halo 3 coming out

244
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:58,040
It's gonna sell even more now that there's nothing competing with it, you know, at least around that same time and you know

245
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Plus microsoft has a really strong lineup for the fall. I mean shit that's gonna really hurt them

246
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:10,040
I mean granted the game is gonna still sell like crazy when it comes out because now there's gonna be nothing competing with it

247
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
but

248
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:18,040
That's still more time and less units out there for sony and that's also more opportunity for them to lose

249
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Even more exclusives if they can't have a good holiday season

250
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:28,040
What about the rumors that it's the the part of the reason of the delay is the playstation 3 development and that it's coding problems

251
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Um, somebody just brought that up in chat and also I remember reading that somewhere, but I don't know

252
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,040
There's there's part of me that felt that that was a little bit fanboy ish. Like I didn't know whether to pump it or not

253
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
I don't know if it's true or not

254
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,040
I mean I could see it because there are a lot of games lately from all different publishers and all different developers

255
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,040
That have been delayed on the playstation 3 end because it is hard to develop for they're not used to it

256
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,040
They're used to developing for the 360 and you know, just developing for the cell is a lot harder

257
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:59,040
So it's possible. I don't think it's true, but I just think the game was just not done

258
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,040
It was a pretty aggressive deadline there

259
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:08,040
They're trying to meet and you know, they probably just want to make sure it's perfect because the game is gonna be open to a crap load of scrutiny, right?

260
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Hell yeah

261
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
So especially from our very own Loki

262
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Hell yeah

263
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,040
All right. Well, you know, that's not the only game to get delayed

264
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,040
I know probably not quite as many of you were looking forward to this

265
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Opened up to say that black site area 51, of course area 51 being one of their popular shooting games

266
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Well, this new area 51 is going to be a very popular game

267
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:34,040
On PC PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 it has been bumped back to November 5th

268
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Which isn't a huge delay

269
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:41,040
I mean, it's not like what we're looking at for the other games there, but it has been bumped back to November

270
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,040
And funny enough, there's no demo for the PlayStation 3 yet on their service

271
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,040
I think there was one supposed to be coming out later this month

272
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Possibly development issues

273
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,040
And this there's another thing also too

274
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,040
That we're forgetting about and I'm going to cover this right now

275
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,040
There's another game delayed lair which is supposed to be coming out actually next week is now coming out in September 4th

276
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,040
And the reason why it's being delayed is to enhance community features in the game

277
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Because if you remember lair is gonna be one of the first games that supports home in both the I guess their trophy system

278
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,040
As well as you know being able to launch the game from home and stuff like that

279
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:29,040
So some of these games also coming out in the fall may be delayed with some of those features in mind as well

280
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Interesting, so I mean that doesn't seem like that huge of a delay though

281
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,040
I mean is that really enough time to kind of fix everything?

282
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
I guess it is

283
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Strange

284
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,040
Alright well we're going to get into the mailbag, we can't delay that anymore

285
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,040
It's been two weeks coming and we want to get to your emails

286
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,040
And hear from some of you folks and unfortunately dark soccer is not here tonight

287
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
But filling in tonight for the mailbag is the one and only Miklotov

288
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Me

289
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,040
So unfortunately we don't have the music tonight so I'll say

290
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,040
I don't know how it goes which one is the mailbag

291
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Oh yeah we're used to seeing the song off scene

292
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Alright whatever get into the mailbag, who emailed us this week?

293
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,680
Well, the first one is from Richard, I'm not going to say his last name because that might

294
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,940
be inappropriate.

295
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,940
You could use the last initial, I think that's okay, alright, thank you.

296
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,940
M, the letter M, says, hey guys, I just felt like saying hi because you guys are so cool.

297
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,340
It was a real bummer you didn't have a show last week.

298
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,140
It feels like it's been longer though.

299
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,780
Also, I just found my Golden Sun game and was wondering did you ever like playing it

300
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,500
because it seriously, to me, lacks the information giving, meaning it doesn't always let me

301
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,780
know where I need to go or do.

302
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,880
And is the new Tales of game for PSP any good?

303
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,000
And I already said who it was by, so I'm not going to say it again.

304
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,540
And he needs to learn how to use commas because he used them incorrectly.

305
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,540
Oh my god, it's just like having Jamie here.

306
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,860
Shane's complaining about the grammar of the emails, this is amazing.

307
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
I'm sorry.

308
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,620
I honestly don't know a lot, I mean, Golden Sun.

309
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,380
I played the crap out of Golden Sun, actually.

310
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,300
Well, then you answer that.

311
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,920
I loved it up until like, I put it down for two days and he's dead on where it doesn't

312
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,180
tell you what you're supposed to do, ever.

313
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,580
So putting it down for two days meant I couldn't play it anymore because I forgot what I was

314
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,420
doing and there was nothing to help me figure out what I was doing, except for the internet.

315
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,980
And I don't think I really used the internet much at that time when it came out.

316
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,780
But yeah, it's a great game if you remember what you're doing or keep track of it.

317
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,900
I don't know anything about Tales game.

318
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,820
Loki, do you know anything about Tales game?

319
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,460
There was a Tales game, got it.

320
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,260
There's a new Tales game I know coming out.

321
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,740
I haven't heard too much about it, though.

322
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,820
I will try to read up on it very quickly while you read the next email.

323
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
Look how long this is.

324
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,820
Do I have to read it all?

325
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,820
Yeah, just read it.

326
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,820
Okay.

327
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,780
This is from Scott L. Wait, crap, he has like a pseudonym at the bottom.

328
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,860
Maybe I'll just wait till that.

329
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,180
That's not from Scott L. at all.

330
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,740
Okay.

331
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
This is what it says.

332
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,500
I'm bad at this, my god.

333
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:11,180
Hey Yet Again, guys, was listening to this week's Part B and had a couple of responses.

334
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,220
Number one, I had a 360 break on me with the disk scratching problem.

335
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,900
This was one day after I bought it and had originally set it up on my coffee table while

336
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,940
I made sure I had everything set up correctly.

337
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,840
Once it was running smoothly, I gently picked it up to move it onto my entertainment center

338
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,980
and next thing I knew, I heard a horrible loud grinding sound.

339
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,680
I had only lifted it about an inch off the table and it, god, there's so much to read,

340
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,340
but I had lifted it gently without tilting it at all.

341
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:46,900
It not only ruined my disk, but when I put another disk in, and I don't want to read

342
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,300
this anymore, this is really long and boring.

343
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:55,140
Okay, the gist of what he's saying is it scratched that disk as well once he put another one

344
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,380
in to test it.

345
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,580
And he learns his error of his ways because- Exactly.

346
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,640
Don't move the system while it's on.

347
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,960
He says it was near the system's launch and he had no idea it would happen.

348
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,500
He has had lots of machines that use his disks from PS1 on, as well as PCs, and I've never

349
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,940
had this happen before when I moved them.

350
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,540
He got a replacement and things have been smooth sailing at first, but he wanted to

351
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:28,060
let everyone know that the disk scratching problem is a blatant fault in the 360 hardware

352
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,660
and can happen without, or with the slightest movement.

353
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,920
It doesn't require shaking or tilting it, even though it sounds like, you know, any

354
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,060
sort of jostling, just picking it up is enough to break it.

355
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,820
And the second thing he says is, you said Microsoft didn't make or license their titles

356
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,820
to DS.

357
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,220
Oh, we talked about this earlier.

358
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,100
Yeah, did he bring up the same mech assault?

359
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,180
Mech assault and Age of Empires.

360
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,900
The chatter beat you to it just because the chat room comment came before the mailbag,

361
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
sorry.

362
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,260
Yeah, and then he talks about Halo.

363
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,260
It's very boring.

364
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,620
Cheers, y'all!

365
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,620
Hero antagonist.

366
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,860
You're the worst email reader ever.

367
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,700
Did you see how long this is, though?

368
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,740
It just kept going on and on.

369
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,940
Yeah, then summarize.

370
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
I did.

371
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,940
I tried.

372
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,040
All right, really quickly, the chat room has some comments here about the, where we did

373
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,060
not know much about the Tales of series, our chat room fills in here.

374
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,060
Hooray.

375
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:25,980
Alex Silvera says, Tales of the world, Radiant mythology for the PSP, simply, it's awesome.

376
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,180
Oh, that's right.

377
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,280
That's the game that came out.

378
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,260
And Zappy says, the PSP Tales of is a fan service for Tales of fan.

379
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,060
There you go.

380
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,060
Hooray.

381
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,620
Next, email is from Rissimo.

382
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,740
It says, hey guys, oh, by the way, I have to censor this because I don't cuss, so this

383
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
should be interesting.

384
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,780
Hey, guys, I've been a faithful listener for about a year and a half now.

385
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:55,940
I've been in the chat room a few times, but I'm often too busy to listen to you live,

386
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,340
so I just download the podcast to my PSP.

387
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:03,020
I think the three of you offer so much to the gaming community and find it sad that

388
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,700
many gamers that listen to podcasts haven't heard of you.

389
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
The end.

390
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Stop it.

391
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,020
Come on, keep going.

392
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:15,900
I love the extreme sarcasm and angst that Jamie has, or that Jamie offers.

393
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,500
Matt's rants are incredibly entertaining, and Rob is just too fracking adorable.

394
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,940
I know you're moving.

395
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,940
The word was fucking?

396
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
Yes.

397
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
Was that the word, Shane?

398
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,940
That's one word.

399
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,940
There's more.

400
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,700
Hey, I'm adorable.

401
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,700
That's great.

402
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:36,220
I know you're moving the studio soon and just want to know about any possible changes.

403
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,420
I really hope you guys add video.

404
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,420
Please consider it.

405
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,060
Loki, I agree with you on the zapper.

406
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,180
Just try to homosexual your anger a little.

407
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,740
I don't even know what that means.

408
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,540
It's the fag your anger joke from like four weeks ago, of which we are noticing more and

409
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,820
more iTunes reviews popping up saying that we need to learn how to fag our anger.

410
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,820
That's stupid.

411
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,820
You're stupid.

412
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,460
Thanks for the oral pleasure, Rissimo.

413
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,100
Hey, any time.

414
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,300
There was no question in that one.

415
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
Next.

416
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,660
Hey, I don't mind a little ego email now and then.

417
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,340
We're on the last email, everybody.

418
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,340
Thank God.

419
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,900
This one I read earlier, and I think it's interesting, and I'm probably going to do

420
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,900
it at some point.

421
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
All right.

422
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Hey, O-L-R. I know I'm a bit late, but it's been a hectic week.

423
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,260
I just listened to the post E3 episode and wanted to make a short comment to the listener

424
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,860
who was looking for more games for the blind.

425
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,180
I recently heard of a game called Sound Voyager for the GBA.

426
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,980
Unfortunately, it's an import only from Japan, but since it's handheld, it's region-free.

427
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:39,220
Anyway, I've not played the game, but according to reviews, it's supposedly more enjoyable

428
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,580
to play this game with your eyes closed.

429
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,940
If you or anyone else is interested, now is a good time to pick it up from Playasia because

430
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,180
it's on sale for $15.

431
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,980
Those are all the bit generation games.

432
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,980
I bought one of them, which I didn't like that one.

433
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,980
Sound Voyager?

434
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,980
No, it wasn't Sound Voyager.

435
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,500
But, I mean, that's one of them.

436
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
They had one.

437
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Yeah, that's one of them.

438
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:03,060
It's generation two, I think, but they're awesome games for the Game Boy Advance.

439
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,660
Just be careful.

440
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,420
There's one I got colorists or whatever that's not very fun.

441
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,020
I didn't really know how to play it.

442
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,220
It ends with hope this helps some people out.

443
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,220
Apollo.

444
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,220
Hooray.

445
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,260
That was a good email.

446
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
That was.

447
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
It's on a hat.

448
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
It's helping listeners.

449
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,260
Yeah.

450
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,900
Unlike the one that was just complimenting you or the guy that writes too much.

451
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,140
You're rude.

452
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,140
All right.

453
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,140
If you want to send an email, we promised Jamie you'll be back next week.

454
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,580
She's just as mean as I am.

455
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,580
Mailbag at Orange Laundry.

456
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,220
Maybe we're going to have Loki read him.

457
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,220
He's a little nicer.

458
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,140
Who can we get in here that's nice to the listeners?

459
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,340
I'm nice.

460
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Not when you have to write a whole crap about stuff that's not interesting.

461
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,900
Mailbag at OrangeLaundryDo.com.

462
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,220
And now it looks like a homosexual your anger might be the new catch line.

463
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,100
I started something worse.

464
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,780
I'm looking like what?

465
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,900
Even what you had before.

466
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,700
I don't understand how the last one makes sense, what you guys said, but I don't understand

467
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,300
how this one makes even more sense.

468
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,300
It was okay.

469
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,460
It was that week that we speculated.

470
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,600
We didn't know that the word was spastic.

471
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,080
Some video game had the word spastic in it, and we speculated that the word was retarded

472
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,060
because we didn't realize the cultural differences.

473
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,460
So we were talking about the word retard and how it might not mean the same thing in Europe

474
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,180
that it means here or whatever, and Loki said retard your anger because I guess it was a

475
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,580
line in anger management or whatever.

476
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,740
It's also like fire retardant, you know?

477
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,740
Oh, okay.

478
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,500
So then I was talking about how fag means something different here in America versus

479
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,820
what it means in Europe, right?

480
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,980
It's not quite the insult it is over there.

481
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,500
So then Irene pops up and goes, hey, Loki, you need to fag your anger.

482
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
And then it caught on.

483
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
I don't know.

484
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,100
That's terrible still.

485
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,220
Didn't get any better hearing the story behind it.

486
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
Sorry.

487
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
It's okay.

488
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Just go.

489
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,920
You know what's even worse is when like you talk on the live internet show about something

490
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,540
that happened on the same live internet show, like just like five weeks ago, it wasn't even

491
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,540
that long ago.

492
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,740
It's probably still up for download.

493
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,740
Don't give me that look.

494
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,740
I'm going to talk.

495
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,740
You're giving me that look.

496
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,140
I'm looking at the internet.

497
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,940
That Laura Roslin look of disapproval.

498
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,940
I don't like it.

499
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
I love Laura Roslin.

500
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,420
I wanted to give her a hug at Comic-Con, but she was too far away.

501
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,420
All right.

502
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,220
Can we talk about something else, including sports games?

503
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,500
We don't talk a whole lot about sports games here on the program, and we've gotten some

504
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,420
feedback that says maybe we ought to talk a little more about sports games.

505
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,380
Maybe if they were interesting, we would.

506
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,740
Remember that whole you're an asshole thing we were talking about earlier?

507
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,380
I like winning 11.

508
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,380
There we go.

509
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,380
Well, there you go.

510
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,940
Do you like a major league baseball power pros?

511
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,100
Oh, the Konami game.

512
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,900
Well, it's Konami and 2K sports.

513
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
That's what makes this interesting.

514
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,900
The two of them are actually teaming up to put out the game.

515
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,380
Oh, what system is it for?

516
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,860
It is coming out for... That's a very good question.

517
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,860
I haven't gotten there yet.

518
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,860
Gosh.

519
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,860
Nintendo Wii and some PlayStation 2.

520
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,860
Yeah.

521
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,860
I totally saw that in the office.

522
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,860
It looked awesome.

523
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,980
Are you even allowed to tell us that?

524
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,260
What office is left?

525
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,260
Oh, okay.

526
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,260
I think it's out in the camera.

527
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,260
Seriously.

528
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,260
Can you tell us more?

529
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:07,380
It was adorable because everybody had big heads and big eyes.

530
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,380
It was pretty cool.

531
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,380
I don't know.

532
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,380
I just saw people playing it.

533
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,380
It looked like fun.

534
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,600
Well, the press release boasts that there's a dozen different game modes in the game.

535
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,100
It's going to have long-term playability.

536
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,500
It'll have, of course, a season mode as most sports games do.

537
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,000
Success mode as well.

538
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,720
In season mode, you become a major league baseball team general manager and, of course,

539
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,780
what is the ultimate goal?

540
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,660
To win the World Series.

541
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,460
Success mode, though, has more traditional role-playing elements and other baseball scenarios

542
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,460
in it.

543
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,220
They're calling this mode unique and compelling, which, of course, press releases are supposed

544
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,220
to talk about.

545
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,860
I don't think it's either of those, but it did look like a lot of fun, so I would highly

546
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,620
recommend it if you like baseball games.

547
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,460
That's what it's really about.

548
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,460
To some people.

549
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,740
It's not going to be the graphics, that's for sure.

550
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:51,340
See, and now there's people in chat going, no, don't talk about sports games, or Ravensdorf

551
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,860
says Sky Talking Baseball makes me want to go kill myself.

552
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,220
I love going to baseball games.

553
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,420
I'm just saying the games are kind of boring as of late.

554
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,580
It's cheapy and cute.

555
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,120
Even I love baseball stars on the end.

556
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,420
There's the occasional sports game that I will.

557
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,480
Like the Ken Griffey games were really fun on the Super Nintendo.

558
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,620
Or like Double Dribble.

559
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,980
How can you not love NBA Jam?

560
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,980
Hello.

561
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,420
Yeah, but just because you don't play Madden doesn't mean you have to hate all sports games.

562
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,420
Yeah, that's true.

563
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,300
Madden is just a little hardcore for maybe some people that don't follow football.

564
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Yeah.

565
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,300
Maybe it's a bit much.

566
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,260
Football is fun to watch, but I don't understand it.

567
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,860
If you play racing games, that's a sport.

568
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
Hello.

569
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,660
They tried to make DDR sport, guys.

570
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Come on.

571
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,820
Well, that's a whole other, you know.

572
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,540
But no, sports games can be good.

573
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,620
And this one, you know, if you like baseball and you don't mind, you know, cute little

574
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,620
things, it's going to be good.

575
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,620
Yeah.

576
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,620
Okay.

577
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,980
Well, one thing that may be good.

578
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:48,020
If you're holding out for All Pro Football 2K8, apparently sales of All Pro Football

579
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,100
2K8 were okay, I guess.

580
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:59,620
I guess 2K was not terribly pleased and not terribly disappointed.

581
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:05,340
So the rumor is that it may be dropping price with the upcoming Madden release.

582
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:10,260
So if it's going to drop price, that would probably be by next week then since, well,

583
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,740
that's when Madden comes out.

584
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,220
So I don't know.

585
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,220
Looks pretty cool.

586
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,580
I did see some funny videos, though, online of OJ Simpson.

587
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:23,060
And there was this one team, I can't remember what it was, but they had a, one of their

588
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:28,420
mascots was this guy with a knife and he was stabbing.

589
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,420
It was funny.

590
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,060
So the fun things you can do with All Pro Football.

591
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:40,820
The OL Army Ninja in chat says, you guess a lot, Loki.

592
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,060
I do.

593
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,660
And I am right a lot as well.

594
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:50,420
Now, okay, even if you, I know some of you guys may not care about the sports games,

595
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,420
but I know you guys are ready for this.

596
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,540
Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

597
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,180
And Super Smash Brothers Brawl, of course, we know it's going to have, you know, huge

598
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,020
multiplayer modes, battles.

599
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,820
But single player mode, we got a little more information about this week.

600
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,580
Personally the single player mode is going to be a bit more of a side scrolling action

601
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,580
game.

602
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:12,500
Now if you think back to Super Smash Brothers Melee, the single player was like awesome.

603
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,540
Like you know, when you were playing some of those levels, like the first one that looked

604
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,420
like the Mario Brothers level or whatever.

605
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,780
Like I know a lot of people that were going, where is this game for the GameCube?

606
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,680
Where is our Mario Brothers game that looks like this on the GameCube?

607
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,500
And so I guess in Brawl they've taken it in another direction.

608
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,700
Now it's like this whole side scrolling action game.

609
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,060
And some people are comparing it to Kingdom Hearts, just because of the fact that you

610
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,620
pull in all these characters from different universes, throw them in a blender and toss

611
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,740
them into this one game.

612
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:42,180
Here's a quote from the story, quote, we've managed to create a complete side scrolling

613
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,260
action game.

614
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,100
Its storyline isn't overwrought, it's hastened along by a bunch of quick movies.

615
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,900
The adventure mode also empathizes character development.

616
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,660
You'll see many famous characters persevering under the weight of their personal histories,

617
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,020
shouldering their unique burdens.

618
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,180
It's really something you won't see anywhere else.

619
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:03,400
That sounds kind of cool because it sounds like it could be something that's all by itself.

620
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,180
Go figure.

621
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,540
Something else I want to say really quickly though, because I noticed it didn't make the

622
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,820
show roll.

623
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:12,340
There's some other information that hit the Smash Brothers dojo this week at SmashBrothers.com

624
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,140
and that is another newcomer.

625
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,460
It's Ike.

626
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,580
And Ike you may have never heard of before, unless you play Fire Emblem, because Ike comes

627
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,860
from the Fire Emblem series.

628
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:25,260
He comes from I think the GameCube one, which probably sold about five copies.

629
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:30,220
Well, whatever you feel about Fire Emblem, Ike is going to be one of the characters in

630
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,220
the game.

631
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,380
It's just like a character you'd have a crush on, Miklotov, actually.

632
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,180
I totally do, because he's got blue hair.

633
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,700
Well, hopefully the Wii version is going to sell a little bit more, because they do have

634
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,940
the Wii one coming out in November here, so.

635
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,940
That's true.

636
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,740
Okay, Loki, I have a question for you, because Shane's going to yell at me if I say this.

637
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,940
Loki, is his hair blue or purple?

638
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,580
From here it looks kind of dark blue.

639
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,940
Oh, it looks purple.

640
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,140
Your eyes suck.

641
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,220
It's purple to me.

642
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,220
There's this inside.

643
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,220
It's not even a joke.

644
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,220
Do we want to explain to the listener?

645
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,220
Miklotov can't see purple.

646
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,220
It's indigo.

647
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,020
I swear his hair is purple.

648
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,300
Well, I'll fight you for it.

649
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,300
It looks a little purple.

650
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,300
It's blue-y purple.

651
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,140
Well, I'll tell you what, well, I don't know.

652
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:20,700
Another interesting thing, we've talked about this numerous times before, but the Neo Geo

653
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,900
is coming to the Virtual Console, and now it is confirmed on Nintendo's Virtual Console

654
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,860
website in Japan.

655
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:36,100
They do show the Neo Geo there, and also have a spot for another console that's yet unnamed.

656
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Dreamcast.

657
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,100
Commodore 64.

658
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
Come on, Dreamcast.

659
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,100
MSX.

660
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,620
Commodore 64, remember that rumor a while back?

661
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,620
Yeah.

662
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,340
Like, wasn't, isn't there supposed to be like an Impossible Mission remake that was supposed

663
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:51,440
to be one of the first games that's not just a direct port of something old?

664
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,060
There's Impossible Mission.

665
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,460
I do remember it's supposed to be coming out, and there's also Elevator Action, which is

666
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,100
now called Spy Game Elevator Action.

667
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,580
You know, I do and I don't want MSX.

668
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,220
I mean, that would be great for the Japanese folks, but they're not going to take the time

669
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,200
to translate any of those games into English for us over here, but can you imagine actually

670
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,700
being able to play Gardic over here in America, the first game in the Guardian Legends series.

671
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,520
And if you've listened to this show for any length of time, you know that I have a huge

672
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,820
nerdgasm boner for the Guardian Legends on 8-bit systems.

673
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,220
It's gross.

674
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,920
But it's true.

675
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,340
There's no games that you get that super excited about.

676
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,340
Silent Hill.

677
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,340
See?

678
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,340
Pump It Up.

679
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,340
That's gross.

680
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,340
Whatever.

681
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,340
Both of those games are amazing.

682
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,340
You did see that there's a new Pump It Up coming again.

683
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,340
It was.

684
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
PSP.

685
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,820
I actually was talking to Rob about that today, and I wanted to cry.

686
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,640
And I was making fun of him, because the game will probably have his favorite Pump song

687
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
of all time in it.

688
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,120
It probably will, and it's really going to make me sad.

689
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
Which for the record is Luzenka.

690
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
Yes.

691
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Save Us.

692
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Luzenka, Save Us.

693
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
I don't know if you like any of these songs.

694
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,860
I mean, maybe Guitar Hero 3 will make you feel better, Miklotov.

695
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,980
There is one song on there that does make me feel better.

696
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,620
Oh, I'm curious to know what it is.

697
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:09,700
There are some new songs that were just announced, and of course, it seems like whenever there's

698
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,480
a new Guitar Heroes game, whether it's the 80s edition or the 3, it seems like the songs

699
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,340
keep slowly rolling out to keep this game in the press.

700
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,700
I will tell you no or yes when you read off the list.

701
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,700
Miss Murder by A.I.

702
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
No.

703
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
Threes and Sevens by Queen in Stone Age.

704
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,700
No.

705
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
Raining Blood by Stare.

706
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,700
No.

707
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
Reptilia by The Strokes.

708
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
No.

709
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
Paranoid by Black Sabbath.

710
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,700
No.

711
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,700
Cities on Flame by Blue Ice or Cold.

712
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,700
No.

713
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,700
Mississippi Queen by Mountain.

714
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,700
No.

715
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,700
You didn't read enough of it.

716
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,700
That's it.

717
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,700
That's the seven new songs.

718
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,820
That video was crazy.

719
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,820
Through the Fire and Flames.

720
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,820
Yes.

721
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
Oh, my God.

722
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,660
I don't know why.

723
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:53,700
It does remind me stuff you'd see in Guitar Freaks and stuff, just the insanely fast...

724
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,460
Made no sense, really.

725
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,820
It's just like, oh, my God.

726
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,820
I like Cherub Rock by the Smashing Pumpkins.

727
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,900
That looks like it would be cool.

728
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,380
Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones.

729
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,380
That's kind of awesome.

730
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,380
If they did Muzzle by...

731
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,380
Sabotage by Beastie Boys.

732
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,380
Hey, this is my bad.

733
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,380
I don't like the Beastie Boys.

734
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,380
Tenacious D songs in there.

735
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,860
My Name is Jonas by Weezer.

736
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,540
I'm still thinking that Rock Band's going to outdo this.

737
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,100
From everything I understand, I'll probably buy them both because I'm such a whore for

738
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,100
music games.

739
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,100
I can admit it.

740
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
I don't know.

741
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,260
Have you seen footage of Guitar Hero 3 since Neversoft took it over?

742
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,260
Yeah.

743
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,260
It looks kind of weird.

744
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,260
That's all right.

745
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,860
DDR looked kind of weird when it went over to the Xbox, but you get used to it.

746
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,860
Still kind of looks weird.

747
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,940
I like how you can give us a more honest opinion now.

748
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,100
I don't think I ever was not honest about how I felt about the game.

749
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,540
I guess that's true, but it seems different now.

750
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,980
What do you think about DDR Hottest Party?

751
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,180
I think it's a piece of crap.

752
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,580
Oh, man.

753
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:50,080
I'm way too honest.

754
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,300
We probably ought to move on to the next topic.

755
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,300
Loki.

756
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:59,380
Yeah, speaking of weird and kind of crappy, Guitar Hero.

757
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:06,300
It's been spotted in the arcade, and it's actually, they had a wonderful shot of it

758
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,860
on Kotaku.

759
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:14,260
It was a game in a Bangkok arcade, and what's funny about it is there's no guitar.

760
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,260
It's just Guitar Hero.

761
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,100
Why are you giggling at him talking about a game in Bangkok if you don't have a perverted

762
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,100
mind, Shane?

763
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,100
No, I'm not laughing at that.

764
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,140
I'll tell you later.

765
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,320
Go on with your story.

766
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,780
What's funny, though, is the whole game looks like popin' music.

767
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:33,540
It's got basically giant buttons for each of the fret buttons, and I guess you play

768
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:38,060
it a little bit like popin' music.

769
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:44,460
One might say, though, it's kind of ripping off of Beatmania, so that's kind of ironic.

770
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,420
So all you do is you just hit the buttons down, and that's like an automatic strumming,

771
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,420
too?

772
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,780
I don't know, but...

773
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
It would just be popin' music.

774
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,780
That's all it is.

775
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,420
I was just saying, it's popin' music.

776
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
Poppin' Hero.

777
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,340
That's a terrible name.

778
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,500
It sounds like a popcorn game.

779
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,140
By the way, I just want to point out, this is what Shane's doing during the show.

780
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,100
You know why he started laughing?

781
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,280
It had nothing to do with the whole Bangkok thing.

782
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,180
He's reading Big Brother 8 live updates and giggling at them, and the housemates calling

783
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,140
each other dirty names.

784
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,580
That's what really goes on here in the OLR studio.

785
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,580
Whatever.

786
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,580
Hey, don't get off topic.

787
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,420
Continue with your video games discussion.

788
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,380
Oh, okay, I will.

789
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,740
So would you play Guitar Hero in the arcade if it was popin' music?

790
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,500
I may try it once just to say that I played it, and that's about it.

791
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,500
I like popin' in the arcade.

792
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,500
It would be fun.

793
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
It would be cool.

794
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,580
I'm sure it's like playing Unjamma Lamy in the arcade, which I played one time.

795
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,580
It was very strange.

796
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:41,580
Like first off, it's made for little kids, so I had to like get on my knees to play this

797
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,580
game.

798
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,080
Shut up!

799
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:50,180
But I like, you know, because I'm really tall, unlike little Asian girls, and I had to like,

800
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,860
you know, squat down to play the, never mind, I'm not going to finish the story.

801
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,780
Was it like trying to use like a little kid urinal or something like that?

802
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:06,340
Like they did in Billy Madison, where he has to like squat down, he falls over.

803
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
Let's see.

804
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:11,180
Ross Steel UT says, you hit the buttons, isn't that every fucking rhythm game ever?

805
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,180
Kinda.

806
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,740
Hit them with your feet, hit them with your hands, hit them with the strumming, hit them

807
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,740
with your voice.

808
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,940
You can't hit buttons with your voice.

809
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,940
Sorta.

810
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,580
You can if you sing really bad.

811
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:30,020
Some people say my voice pushes people's buttons.

812
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,860
I love dead air.

813
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:37,420
Moving on to another story, and this is a story that seems to come up every single week,

814
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,860
but there's a website out there, Inner Bits, that is saying that developers have their

815
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,860
dirty little hands on a six axis controller that rumbles.

816
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,700
And yes, we've been hearing this story on and off, and Loki has been insisting for weeks

817
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,540
and weeks that yes, this is coming, but apparently various Sony developers do have their hands

818
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,820
on the six axis with rumble.

819
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:02,660
Rumor is it could be their big announcement at the convention in Germany, the Leipzig

820
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,660
convention.

821
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:10,520
Congratulations for spending $499 on your brand new 60 gig PlayStation 3 system.

822
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,380
Also congratulations, you're now gonna have to buy new controllers, thank you.

823
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,060
What's also funny is they actually did come out and-

824
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,060
Sure, why not?

825
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,060
The same thing happened on PS1 and PS2.

826
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,060
Oh yeah.

827
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,060
Wait.

828
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,940
But they didn't say rumble is last generation then.

829
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,700
PS1 didn't have the little analog sticks to be analyzed, and PS2 didn't have rumble to

830
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,700
begin with.

831
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,700
I have a PS2 controller that doesn't have rumble.

832
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,700
Really?

833
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,700
Yes.

834
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,700
I swear they had-

835
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,700
I bought one at launch.

836
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,700
It had rumble.

837
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,820
Then why the fuck doesn't my PlayStation 2 controller rumble?

838
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,820
Is it broken?

839
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,820
No.

840
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,820
I think it is.

841
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,820
Are you sure it's a PlayStation 2 controller?

842
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,820
I'm sure.

843
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,820
It could be just an-

844
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,820
A black PS1 controller?

845
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,820
Yeah, they had those.

846
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,820
Did they?

847
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,820
Son of a bitch.

848
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,580
Yeah, because I remember I bought mine at launch and-

849
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,580
Yeah, I worked it.

850
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,580
Oh my god.

851
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,580
I failed.

852
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:52,580
Jesus.

853
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:58,420
I do remember having to buy the DualShock controllers at one time, so yeah, that makes sense.

854
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,860
But this is something that they took away and now they're putting back.

855
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:07,860
But they said they justified taking away, because it was a last generation feature.

856
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,860
Oh, okay.

857
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,420
Because rumble is so last gen.

858
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,900
Welcome to last gen, Sony.

859
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,980
They're all, well, last gen sold better than this gen, so let's go back.

860
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,020
I think that's what they're doing.

861
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:25,020
They're like, maybe if we can just make it like the PS2, it'll sell.

862
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:30,900
Anyways, so another interesting thing, Warhawk is finally, the price point has been announced.

863
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,300
We knew before that the retail version was going to be $59.99, and that was going to

864
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:41,020
include a Bluetooth headset, as well as some extra bonus behind the scenes crap.

865
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:46,420
And now the online version, probably the most expensive download I think you'll ever see

866
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:53,700
on a console, well, so far at least, is $39.99 to download this game.

867
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,380
You thought Luminous was expensive.

868
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,340
Well, actually, if you add it up, if you add up the game itself and then all the fucking

869
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,100
little packs they have with it, maybe it's getting close.

870
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,660
It's probably about $25.

871
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,140
That's before we even get to packs.

872
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,820
I mean, what makes you think that Warhawk's not going to have downloadable content?

873
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,820
Good point, good point.

874
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,780
Alright, so are you going to buy this though?

875
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,780
Nope.

876
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,980
I have, I do not like online only multiplayer games.

877
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,980
That's true.

878
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,980
No more MMOs.

879
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,980
That's what turned me off to...

880
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,980
MMOs are different.

881
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:29,700
This is just like straight, you know, online only multiplayer.

882
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,480
It feels like half a game to me.

883
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,780
It's like taking the online portion of your single player first person shooter and just,

884
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:40,820
well, we didn't feel like creating this story, so let's just make the game.

885
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,060
Okay, the chat room is all like saying, you know, and I appreciate the chat room and their

886
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:50,740
comments, but they're all like, Sky, have you turned on the rumble and the various games?

887
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,700
Give me a little credit here, people.

888
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:57,100
I mean, okay, I've been doing an internet radio program about video games with my friends

889
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,340
for five years.

890
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,360
Okay, give me a little bit of the benefit of the doubt that I know how to turn these

891
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:06,820
features on and games and check and see, you know, all this stuff.

892
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:10,120
I realize I'm not perfect and I don't get things right all the time.

893
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,100
We're human, but please.

894
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,380
I'm trying to remember if yours even has the little button in the middle to turn on.

895
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,500
It does.

896
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,500
And we're back, folks.

897
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,500
Sorry about that.

898
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,500
We don't know what happened.

899
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:22,500
I can tell you what happened.

900
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,180
This Skype mess with the settings there.

901
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,500
Well, live radio, boys and girls, we're in the temporary studio.

902
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,560
What can you do?

903
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,560
These things happen.

904
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,940
Now, I don't know what the last thing the folks heard was, though, before we went to

905
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,940
the Skype line.

906
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,180
So quickly give us the last story again real quick there.

907
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,180
Sorry, folks.

908
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,180
Live radio, things happen.

909
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,180
The last story?

910
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,180
Like, which story?

911
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:42,380
The story about the start of the read?

912
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,380
Okay.

913
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:48,340
So we were going to cover one story that we ran on the website about the Tokyo game show

914
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,860
list for Sega.

915
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,260
That makes me sad.

916
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:53,860
And that looks really awesome.

917
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,660
It's such a wonderful list.

918
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:58,460
Even like, Fighters Megamix 2 and stuff, I was like, oh, hell yeah.

919
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,460
New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio.

920
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,540
New Space Channel 5 and Jet Set Radio, yeah.

921
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,540
Guess what?

922
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,540
It's fake.

923
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:08,340
Because it was too much of a Sega fanboy's dream.

924
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,060
And we posted that on our website.

925
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,060
Yes.

926
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,060
Awesome job.

927
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,060
Awesome job, everybody.

928
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,020
Now, how did it get debunked?

929
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:19,740
The original source actually has posted a retraction and apology.

930
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:24,900
So saying we lied because we made all of those up because people wanted to hear that.

931
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,740
Yeah, so they are a big douche, apparently.

932
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:35,660
It says, let's see, it says there has been a lot of controversy regarding the recently

933
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:39,140
posted rumor regarding Sega's possible Tokyo game show lineup.

934
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:44,540
Now, I was originally very defensive of this piece and because of who sent it in, his long

935
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:52,500
time go-to guy named Rob, Rob, what did you do, has sent me exclusive tips of four years

936
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,540
and until this most recent one, all were accurate.

937
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:05,020
And apparently, Rob says, sorry guys, says that I'm sorry for this whole damn mess.

938
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:07,660
I assure you that this will not happen again.

939
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:10,660
I have to say I applaud you guys for being right on top of this.

940
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,820
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

941
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:16,900
I think really some of those games sounded plausible up until you hit Shenmue 3.

942
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:21,820
I can tell you one thing, though, that will be a Tokyo game show this year.

943
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:27,420
I don't know if you can get excited about this or not, but a new Sonic Riders game,

944
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,580
Sonic Riders Zero Gravity will be there.

945
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,900
It's coming out on the Wii and PlayStation 2, actually around the same time as the first

946
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,020
one came out last year, around February, I believe.

947
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:44,500
If it was a new version of Sonic R with the same awesome music, maybe I'd care, but...

948
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,140
Yeah, it's just not...

949
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:51,980
Riders was okay, it was an alright game, but, I don't know, put it this way, as long as

950
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:56,900
it controls better than Sonic the Hedgehog on PlayStation 3 and 360, I'm fine with that.

951
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,140
Ooh, that was, that's a burn right there because that game sucks.

952
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:04,740
Alright, so, I'm very sorry, guys, we're not going to be able to do the Skype line tonight,

953
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:09,620
live radio, and things are broken and it's not running at the same time as our recording

954
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:13,060
software does, so that's okay, we'll bring it back next week.

955
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:16,900
We'll take more calls next week to make up for it, but we will do some Ask Orange Lounge

956
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,900
tonight.

957
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,460
We do have our chat room is still working, you guys can interact with us through that,

958
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:25,060
so if you have a question for us, send me a private message in the chat room and we'll

959
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,900
do some Ask Orange Lounge here in just a moment, I see some questions starting to come in.

960
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,140
I like the bubble noises, that was fun.

961
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,740
No, I didn't like that, I don't know if the chat, that might have been when our stream

962
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,660
died, I don't know if they heard the bubble noises or not.

963
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:43,860
Well, you can probably go in there and adjust it so that it's line in stuff, I don't know,

964
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,860
fucking hate Skype.

965
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:50,180
Yeah, I don't know, at this point, let's just, do we really want to break the show further

966
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,180
tonight?

967
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,180
Yeah!

968
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,180
Might as well go all or nothing.

969
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,740
Let's go all the way, man, let's break the show.

970
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:00,380
Alright, well there are some comments in chat about the whole Sega thing going on, Ross

971
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:03,980
Deal UT says, Sega doesn't know how to make good games anymore, how could you not know

972
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,300
this was fake?

973
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,780
They do ruin all their franchises they touch lately.

974
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:13,200
And also, if you looked at that list, that's a huge fucking list, I mean, there's no way

975
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,420
they're working on that much.

976
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:19,580
The only thing that was missing from it was Panzer Dragoon Saga 2, that was it.

977
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,700
Everything else is like, and boy.

978
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:30,140
Let's see, um, Raven's Dolphin says, no Skype, wow, OLR is having my kind of failure.

979
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,260
There you go.

980
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,340
Dartitsui has said they should make a new Jet Set Radio for the Wii anyway.

981
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:36,380
Not for the Wii, make it for the 360.

982
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,660
Dartitsui says, oh hell, a new Samba de Amigo.

983
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,660
Yes.

984
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:40,660
I found my Samba stuff.

985
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,660
I know, I saw that, it made me happy.

986
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,420
Did you see that they had a Samba de Amigo listed as a PSP title on it?

987
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,980
Yeah, what are you going to do, shake your stupid PSP?

988
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,100
I'm going to make a game for the PSP.

989
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,100
Called Shake?

990
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:57,300
No, no, no, no, no, no, hear me out, and it's going to have a rumble, like, detector, and

991
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:59,100
it's going to be like a baby simulator.

992
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,500
I knew it was going to be a Shake the Baby game.

993
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,500
I knew when you started talking it was going to be a Shake the Baby game, that's so wrong.

994
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,500
I like it.

995
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,340
Alright, so we promised we'd do some Ask Orange Lounge, so I'm going to read some questions

996
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,860
here from our chatroom, and unfortunately we don't have the theme music unless Shane

997
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:14,860
wants to sing it.

998
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,860
Um, what's the theme music?

999
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,740
Do the same as the mailbag music, because we're cheap here on this program.

1000
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,100
Um, no thank you.

1001
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,780
Alright, let's Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question.

1002
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,780
Let's start off with this.

1003
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,940
That's probably a stupid question indeed.

1004
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:31,300
Well, it's from Raven's Dolphin, and the question just hearts, just teasing.

1005
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,660
Raven's Dolphin says, Skye, how come you do not talk about your iBook, because I got a

1006
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,420
MacBook and like it.

1007
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,540
I'm playing with it, so he can't talk about it.

1008
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:43,500
I like my iBook, I do, you know what, it's the only internet I have right now because

1009
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,020
that's how I'm able to steal the neighbor's Wi-Fi.

1010
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,660
The screensaver's really pretty.

1011
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:52,020
Well you can choose from several different screensavers, I don't know if you're aware.

1012
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,420
I think there's much more to the Mac than just the screensaver.

1013
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,420
Without it.

1014
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:00,540
Oh yeah, there's being able to play WoW on it, but very badly, because I can't fly down.

1015
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:04,900
For me, who does a lot of work on the road, and who travels a lot, it's great.

1016
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:09,740
I love the Mac for that stuff, and it's got a great DVD authoring program on it.

1017
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,780
I will give it that.

1018
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:12,820
Let's go to some more questions.

1019
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:17,640
Of course, Ask Orange Lounge tonight in lieu of the Skype line, since we do not have the

1020
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,860
Skype line tonight.

1021
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,660
DJ Janai asks, how was moving last week?

1022
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:27,100
It was long, and tedious, and I'm very glad to be done with it.

1023
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:31,340
And the new house that I live in is so much better than the apartment I was in before,

1024
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:35,140
with no disrespect to Extrofer, because living with Extrofer was fun, but just the place

1025
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,780
itself is so much better now, or in a house.

1026
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,380
There's actually a backyard and a lawn demo, it's something else.

1027
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:45,220
I saw an animal run by in the backyard today, it was really scary, it was loud and thumpy.

1028
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,020
Cool, what kind of animal was it?

1029
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,740
Like either a cat or a raccoon or something.

1030
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,740
Maybe a possum.

1031
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,740
Yeah, possums.

1032
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,740
We'll see.

1033
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:57,460
DJ Tyrant wants to know, what do you think of any of the announcements at BlizzCon this

1034
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,460
weekend?

1035
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,460
Oh my goodness.

1036
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,460
Let's talk about BlizzCon.

1037
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:05,460
DJ Tyrant, listen to part A, buddy, listen to part A and let us know what you think.

1038
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:11,020
Going to Alex Silvara, does anyone like the Dynasty Samurai Warriors series besides me?

1039
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,140
Oh, I did hear there's a new incarnation coming out with that on Xbox 360.

1040
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,020
Okay, I'm through.

1041
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:21,700
They're going to be doing Dynasty Warriors Gundam, that's coming out in August.

1042
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:26,260
Then they've got that Warriors Orochi, which is coming out in September, which is pretty

1043
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:30,020
much Dynasty Warriors mixed with Samurai Warriors, and to be honest, I couldn't tell

1044
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,400
the two apart.

1045
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,920
Now there's Dynasty Warriors 6, which actually looks like they did something with the series

1046
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:44,460
and made it look a little bit better on 360, so I don't know.

1047
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,460
Gameplay-wise, they haven't changed anything, but graphically, it looks like they haven't

1048
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,660
changed anything either, so I don't know.

1049
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,420
Not much I could really be excited about.

1050
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:59,040
Although there is Samurai Warrior Katana later this year, so.

1051
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,020
Going over to a question from RossDLUT, here's actually a really good question and something

1052
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,660
that wasn't brought up earlier in the show.

1053
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:08,660
With the recent raids on mod chippers, the internet's pretty much gone nuts.

1054
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:12,500
The question I have is, well, are people so selfish that they feel gamers shouldn't

1055
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,140
have to support game companies?

1056
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:18,540
Personally, I'd rather XSeed were able to make profits than have 500 pirates to every

1057
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,620
one importer.

1058
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,620
Interesting point.

1059
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,580
I mean, because there's been, like, those raids going on, apparently, about all these

1060
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,100
people that will mod chip your systems.

1061
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,020
I'm very curious to hear what you think about this, Loki.

1062
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,740
About modding and stuff like that?

1063
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,460
And all the crackdowns and all that?

1064
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:39,660
Well, I mean, what they're doing is violating the law, but, I mean, at the same time, there's

1065
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:44,020
ways around things that you don't necessarily have to put a hardware mod chip into it, nor

1066
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,140
to be able to play stuff from other countries.

1067
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:50,580
I think, also, the problem is, like, with a lot of these things, you know, games are

1068
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:55,540
expensive now, don't get me wrong, but, at the same time, you know, people are kind of

1069
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,380
jaded with paying 60 bucks and getting crap.

1070
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,620
They're getting hosed, and, like, they kind of justify it in a way, well, fuck this.

1071
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:06,820
I wasted, you know, 60 bucks on Bomberman Act Zero, and I thought it was going to be

1072
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:11,660
a really awesome game, and it's just crap, you know, and now I can't get my money back,

1073
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:15,380
so fuck you, I'm going to steal your next game, you know.

1074
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,660
There's that, and there's also, you know, with importing, I don't understand why more

1075
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:24,500
systems are like the PlayStation 3 and the PSP, you know, let people import their games

1076
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,500
if they want to.

1077
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,300
Hell, it sells an extra copy for you, you still make some money off of it, and, you

1078
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,300
know, I don't think it's really hurting anything, okay, it's going to be a Japanese version

1079
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,700
of the game or something.

1080
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,580
Big deal, you know.

1081
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,380
I think in the big scope of things, too, there's so few people that actually import in the

1082
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,820
big scope of gaming, it's not that big a deal, I don't think.

1083
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,820
It's not.

1084
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:47,420
I mean, hell, that's, how else did Elite Beat Agents get a release here, but from people

1085
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,420
importing Ohndon?

1086
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,420
Exactly.

1087
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,580
And you know what, hey, look, my buying, um, GS68 just said the same damn thing in chat.

1088
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:59,060
You know, my buying Wangan Midnight, that sold one extra copy for them, and you know

1089
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:00,060
why I bought it?

1090
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:05,180
Because there's not a lot of stuff coming out over here, so, what the hell?

1091
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:10,180
Um, yeah, you know, but as far as just, like, pirating to get a bunch of games for free,

1092
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:15,300
especially when you're downloading things like Halo 3, and Blue Dragon, you know, assumably

1093
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,780
when these games come out, Blue Dragon, kind of like the stuff, you know, you know it's

1094
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,780
not going to be like Borrow Man X-Zero, it's a little different.

1095
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:25,980
Let me put it this way, okay, yeah, my PSP is modded, yes, I can play games without having

1096
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,860
to buy them, but, would I have bought those games if it wasn't modded?

1097
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,300
No, I wouldn't have.

1098
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,820
I just play games that are from other countries just to check them out.

1099
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,540
I normally don't end up, you know, buying them, I would have felt bad if I actually

1100
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,540
bought them because they sucked.

1101
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,540
So.

1102
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:44,060
It's also not like you don't buy video games, I mean, you have a shitload of video games

1103
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,180
everywhere in this house, so, you buy a lot of video games.

1104
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:51,220
I spend a lot of money on video games, and you know what, if I can play something for

1105
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:55,900
free instead of paying for it, yeah, I'll do it because it frees up more money for buying

1106
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,340
something else.

1107
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:03,340
Legend of Zaku has this for Ask Orange Lounge, bring back the camera, bringing back the webcam

1108
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,340
would be hot.

1109
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:07,980
It looks like it is going to happen in the new studio, but we're just not sure, I mean,

1110
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,180
getting a webcam in there isn't a problem, now it's just about delivering it to the site,

1111
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,420
so we will have more information on that later.

1112
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:18,700
Yes, we've seen the suggestions about, I don't know what, Justin TV, Operator 11, whatever

1113
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:23,500
site Travis Donovan's using, or Saturday, we're looking into what we want to use, and

1114
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,500
we'll have more information on that later.

1115
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:31,460
I even thought about doing something in here, if we had time, so I buried the Xbox Vision

1116
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,220
camera because I haven't used it for anything.

1117
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,720
Something soon, we will definitely have a cam in the new studio because the new studio

1118
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,540
will be awesome, I hope.

1119
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:44,140
Nintendo maniac 64 says, question for Loki, how does it feel to be surrounded by grown

1120
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,140
gay men?

1121
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:49,540
I don't, I don't get it.

1122
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,820
I know, what's the big deal?

1123
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,100
I don't know.

1124
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,860
Ban him, he's homophobic, he's the one that broke Gay Gamer.

1125
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:01,140
Speaking of which, you know, what do you think about that whole like GayGamer.net getting

1126
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:02,140
targeted?

1127
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,140
I felt really sad.

1128
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:08,340
I met Flynn at Comic Con, and he's a really nice guy, so somebody doing that to his site

1129
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,340
really kind of makes me...

1130
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:13,260
Especially if it was all this hate crime and stuff, you know, that's so gay that somebody

1131
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,260
would do that.

1132
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,260
It really is.

1133
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,500
It's a joke, people, bad joke, sorry.

1134
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,860
I am gay, I can say that.

1135
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,460
No, it's still bad.

1136
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:27,380
NM64 says, how few frames per seconds do you predict your current PC would get while playing

1137
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:28,380
Crysis?

1138
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,640
I think mine would die.

1139
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,640
As it is, shit, until I upgraded the video drivers, which I think they were current,

1140
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,780
but for some reason it was having issues, because they installed like three different

1141
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:44,460
sets of video drivers, they were all running concurrent.

1142
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:49,260
You know, ever since I did that, my computer before that was just resetting randomly, it

1143
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,260
was just boops!

1144
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:51,260
Dop.

1145
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,260
I used to have that problem.

1146
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,480
And I was like, fucking A, I'm gonna have to buy another PC.

1147
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,740
I did though, this weekend though, I bought a magazine, because I'm actually looking to

1148
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:04,660
buy a new PC, or build one, and unfortunately my dream PC is like $11,000, so I need to

1149
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,380
scale down quite a bit.

1150
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,940
How do you make a, wow.

1151
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:12,100
But they have a nice article, this PC game, or PC building bible, they have a build your

1152
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:17,420
own game PC under $1400, and it looks nice, and it's all blue.

1153
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:24,700
I want an all blue PC, somebody get me some paint, I'll paint my PC, and it'll be blue.

1154
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,940
Or Rob will say it's purple, and try to trick me, but it's not going to be, it's going to

1155
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:28,940
be blue.

1156
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,740
Alright, one more AskBorne's Lounge question for you guys, and then we're gonna call it

1157
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,740
a show.

1158
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:38,620
Dark Tetsuya is asking, did you hear ID is releasing all their older stuff on Steam,

1159
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,980
even as far back as the Commander Keen stuff?

1160
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,300
What's a Commander Keen?

1161
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,300
How old are you?

1162
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,580
You're like a baby, you weren't around for Commander Keen, were you?

1163
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:52,940
Commander Keen was kinda like, I don't know, like, ID's Mario game for the PC, I don't

1164
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,380
know how else to explain it really.

1165
01:00:54,380 --> 01:01:01,940
It was like a side-scrolling game that was very it was fun though, a lot of folks that

1166
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,020
had computers in the 90s remember.

1167
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,140
It was the shit on shareware.

1168
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,140
That's right.

1169
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:08,140
It was awesome.

1170
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,140
And all about jazz.

1171
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,780
I actually did not, I heard, I know that name, but I don't know what it is.

1172
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,700
I heard some of their other stuff was coming to Steam, but I didn't know the old stuff

1173
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:19,060
was, they didn't, they didn't Freeware release that stuff a long time ago?

1174
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,860
I don't know.

1175
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,740
What was the other company that was with ID back then, Epic, right?

1176
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:25,180
Epic Mega Games.

1177
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,860
And didn't Epic do ZZT?

1178
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:27,860
What's that?

1179
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,860
Uh, yes.

1180
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,860
ZZ Top?

1181
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:30,860
No, no, no.

1182
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,340
ZZT was like this totally awesome game.

1183
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,340
It is.

1184
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,340
Oh my gosh.

1185
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,340
ZZT was rad.

1186
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:41,540
So many, I was such a nerd that I spent so many hours making games.

1187
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:45,100
You can make your own games, it was like a programming language for games, but it's hard

1188
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,100
to explain.

1189
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:51,860
It's all using ASCII characters, so your games would be very blocky and stuff, but as it

1190
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:58,260
went on, they also released this new thing called Mega Zooks where you can create your

1191
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:01,100
own games as well, but it was a little bit more intuitive.

1192
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:06,980
They had, you know, Ooh, mod music, you could, you know, mod tracker stuff in there and just

1193
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,800
all sorts of interesting things.

1194
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:14,320
I want to say like years ago on this show, like we had an entire three hour conversation

1195
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,820
about ZZT one night.

1196
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:16,820
Like it's crazy.

1197
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:17,820
It's what?

1198
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:18,820
I have an excellent idea.

1199
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,820
What, OLR the ZZT?

1200
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:27,820
We need a contest, a game designing contest in ZZT sponsored by OLR.

1201
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,820
That would be awesome.

1202
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:29,820
All right.

1203
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,420
We'll, we'll work out the details and come up with that for a future program.

1204
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:33,420
That would be awesome.

1205
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,820
Is there still ZZT programming communities?

1206
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:35,820
Oh, we can find it.

1207
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,580
There's gotta be somewhere.

1208
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:40,860
Shadow Slayer says, I swear this guy is making these games up.

1209
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,060
Put it on Wikipedia or something.

1210
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,260
I'm not making this shit up.

1211
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,220
ZZT is a real game.

1212
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,340
Hitstun says, fuck the unreal engine ZZT forever.

1213
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,340
Amen.

1214
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:56,540
I'm glad your listeners are old.

1215
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,860
Would you allow them to use super ZZT or any of the other ZZT months?

1216
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,180
I didn't like super ZZT.

1217
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:05,780
If anything, we'd either do it in the original ZZT or we would do Mega Zooks cause Mega Zooks

1218
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:06,780
was pretty awesome.

1219
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,000
You can do a lot of cool shit in that.

1220
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,800
I want to have, I'm banging on the desk because I have a great idea.

1221
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,980
You know, one thing I've said I wanted to do for orange lounge in our new season, we

1222
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:19,380
get to the new studio is more interviews, we need to get people who made ZZT on the

1223
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,380
program.

1224
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,380
Just to talk about ZZT.

1225
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:23,340
I want to talk about it.

1226
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:24,340
Interview me.

1227
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:28,060
I wear a top hat and a monocle and a mustache so I can pretend I'm old.

1228
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,020
You can pretend you're Colonel Mustard.

1229
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,020
What?

1230
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,020
He didn't wear a top hat.

1231
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,740
I'll get a cane too.

1232
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,780
I'll be like, yes, that's ZZT.

1233
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,780
Here it is.

1234
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,100
Here it is in Wikipedia.

1235
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,100
It's right there.

1236
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,100
Oh, it had color?

1237
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,660
Yes, it did have color.

1238
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,340
They had color back when we were kids.

1239
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,340
Imagine that.

1240
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:45,340
It's crazy.

1241
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:48,140
It was created in 1991 by Tim Sweeney of Epic Games.

1242
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:51,020
Wasn't it you who I asked about color TVs?

1243
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,020
Yes.

1244
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:57,740
I asked if he watched, what it was like if you were asking me like what seeing color

1245
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:05,540
TV was like for the first time and I was serious because I didn't know how old do you think

1246
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,540
he is?

1247
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:10,580
And he asked me how black and white TV was back in the day and I'm thinking like, well,

1248
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:13,980
they used to show Dennis the Menace reruns on Nickelodeon in black and white, but that

1249
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,980
was about it.

1250
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:15,980
I didn't know.

1251
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:22,220
It was a time though that I did have an old ass, it was a 286 system, it was like a 28620

1252
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:26,460
or something like that with the whole 32 megs of hard drive space.

1253
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:31,820
And anyways, so there was one game we had because we had just these really budget ass

1254
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,820
games.

1255
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:36,340
It was like a, what was it, a Muppets game or something like that and because it was

1256
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:40,140
on a black and white monitor, you had to play it on like a CGA monitor or something like

1257
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:43,580
that, which was four colors and they all sucked.

1258
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,180
It was fucking hard to see it.

1259
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:49,580
You couldn't see and wanted to push a button or something so it just went blank screen.

1260
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:52,900
Finally one day we were like, I think I see something on there.

1261
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:56,980
And so we hit the button and then we found out, oh look, the game sucks.

1262
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:03,020
Loki look at this, it's a screenshot from the town of ZZT featuring the bank of ZZT.

1263
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:08,140
The bank of ZZT and the whole program, that first, because you can play through, there's

1264
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,220
like this huge game and stuff that you can play through on there.

1265
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:16,820
And then the actual, the game that it came with was locked so you couldn't edit it.

1266
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:20,500
But there was a program that you can hack the thing and actually unlock it.

1267
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,340
And man, the bank little program thing was kind of complicated.

1268
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,820
It was pretty cool looking.

1269
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:31,100
But shit, I remember my friends, we used to be like real into like Robotech and shit and

1270
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:35,220
he would make like Robotech ZZT levels and all sorts of weird stuff.

1271
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:39,300
Oh my god, remember Code Red, which was one of the add-on packs for ZZT?

1272
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:42,980
No, no, like this huge series somebody made for ZZT.

1273
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:47,700
There was a lot of really big series, I mean god, back in the day I used to be so into

1274
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:48,700
that stuff.

1275
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,420
Alright, we need to stop being so old.

1276
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,420
So we're going to talk about this.

1277
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,220
What, you got something else real quick?

1278
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,700
No, I said we're going to just keep talking about this if we don't.

1279
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:01,620
I do have some last minute stories, they're interesting, well I don't know if they're

1280
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:08,620
interesting but we've got a picture of Big Brain Academy, the board game.

1281
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:13,460
I love Big Brain Academy on the DS, that could be cool.

1282
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:18,300
And it looks like it comes with your own, I don't know, crack scale?

1283
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:22,140
Because there's like a weird scale on there.

1284
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:25,060
I guess that's what that is, some sort of drug scale.

1285
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:28,620
Train your brain to smoke more crack.

1286
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:32,300
So that's kind of interesting.

1287
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,440
The Wii remote's getting yet another strap.

1288
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:36,780
Yay!

1289
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:37,840
Hahaha.

1290
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:41,000
Hurray for straps!

1291
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,960
Give it up for straps everybody!

1292
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,480
Alright, those Wii remotes are strapped yo.

1293
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,820
Woo hoo.

1294
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,820
That's all I got.

1295
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:49,820
That's it.

1296
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:50,820
Alright, thank you.

1297
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,480
No but don't they have like little clasps on them, little new straps?

1298
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,920
Yeah, there's straps with clasps on now.

1299
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:56,920
Alright.

1300
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:57,920
Wooo.

1301
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:03,200
Jaden has a tip for you Shane if you want to experience what black and white

1302
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:08,100
TV was like turn the color setting all the way down on your color TV and you'll

1303
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:12,100
have a black and white TV. Why would I do that? I don't even know how to do that on my TV.

1304
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,420
Because you wanted to know what watching black and white TV was like so there you

1305
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:23,120
go. Well I was asking to hear about it. Or watch the purple network. I'll flip you off.

1306
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:28,960
I thought you didn't swear. It's not. It's my fingers. I remember having an old-ass TV and

1307
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,080
trying to I was like ooh I get 13 channels that sucks let's see if I can

1308
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:41,720
tune anything on and UHF oh no I get one Spanish channel that's about it. I have a

1309
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:46,480
last-minute story hurry for those people that play Wow

1310
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,800
apparently engineering is getting a nice little bonus finally since engineering

1311
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,800
normally sucks make your own flying mounts probably for siege stuff for the

1312
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:04,840
new expansion but still that's pretty cool nerd whatever I hate you all right

1313
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,760
we're gonna wrap it up let me talk about something old and boring he's gonna

1314
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,080
well let's go around and get everybody's final thought final thoughts for tonight

1315
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,560
Shane thank you for being here and contributing your unique perspective to

1316
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:22,280
our program you're welcome and your final thought please I want to play the

1317
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:29,840
new expansion because it's blue and not purple so shut up my final thought is I

1318
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:35,160
want to go see a movie because yeah I do I want to see hairspray this and I want

1319
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:40,360
to see a movie because I'm sick of moving and unpacking boxes so movie I'll

1320
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:45,080
think about it all right thank you I will look at your final thought my final

1321
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:51,440
thought is yet another last-minute story and it was Nestor J the NES emulator

1322
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:58,680
just got released on the PSP version 1.11 RM which means rewind and mirror

1323
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:02,120
mods so apparently this game has now become like Prince of Persia the sands

1324
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,720
of time where you can play like Super Mario Brothers and oh no I fucked up

1325
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:11,760
rewind that's pretty cool wait Nestor like a remix like Howard and

1326
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:17,760
Nestor yes and also like the NES emulator on the PSP or every other

1327
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:22,680
platform out there all right did you not get that reference cuz I got roles and

1328
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,600
now I subscribe to Nintendo Power when I was little I saw the first issue in a

1329
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,800
box somewhere it's all torn I probably don't anymore I remember the

1330
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:34,080
Castlevania issue and the issue six or the last issue of the Nintendo fan club

1331
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,240
I don't know I don't know that's that's before my time I know that something

1332
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:43,920
else alright that's it guys we're going to go now and call it a show so have a

1333
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:50,320
great night until next week go away see you next time thank you so much for

1334
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:54,640
supporting independent radio if you like the show tell two friends about our show

1335
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,380
because that's how we get the word out because of course you know we don't well

1336
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:01,960
we're poor so we can't exactly buy advertisements and magazines so we rely

1337
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,600
on your word of mouth if you enjoyed what you heard or if you didn't enjoy

1338
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,120
what you hear tell people how much we suck cuz we'll still get listeners that

1339
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:12,600
way and I'll make ourselves feel good so that's it and that's really really it

1340
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,000
there's no outro tonight we lost all our music in the temporary studio remember

1341
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:36,040
so Orange Lounge blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah we're just gonna end it right here good night
