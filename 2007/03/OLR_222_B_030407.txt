Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
And we are back on Orange Lounge Radio here with part B of our podcast, or audio blog, audio cast, whatever you want to call it.
It's the audio archive of our program, and it's split up into two parts.
Part A is released usually early, early Monday morning, late Sunday night, however you want to look at it.
Part B comes out sometime on Wednesday, whenever we get around to uploading it.
But this is the second half of a continuing show that is taped live on Sunday nights.
And if you feel like coming down for a show, you should join us.
www.orangeloungeradio.com We have a chat room.
Hi, chat room.
And you missed our great bonus segment and things you can only hear live or on our rebroadcast at allgames.com.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Starting off this segment with some pretty big news.
It has to do with the Halo 3 beta.
Rumor is that the Halo 3 beta is going to be split into two sessions.
The first session will begin on March 21st.
Seems pretty bold that these predictions are naming dates.
But this is from Xbox Portugal, who also brought the first Halo 3 beta screenshots.
The first session will only be for those that got emails from Bungie.
That starts March 21st.
The second session will be also open to those who bought Crackdown.
That will end in June, but no start date given for that yet.
But, Loki, you were telling me during the break you heard this is bullshit.
Yeah, I heard it's bullshit.
How is it proven wrong?
I think it was either someone at Microsoft or someone at Bungie that said that it would just be one giant session.
That they weren't going to do two different ones.
Well, there you have it.
So, Xbox Portugal lies.
Maybe not.
It's just miscommunications.
Loki said Halo 3 would be coming out in the spring, which was also a lie.
So, there you have it.
Lies!
You should be ashamed.
No.
Something, though, that actually is pretty cool, as announced in OXM, the Halo theme is going to be a downloadable track for Guitar Hero 2.
I think that's pretty cool.
It's definitely going to be something that I think is going to get a lot of people to look more into those downloaded tracks and something that's going to make a little bit of revenue.
So why not?
That would be cool.
Hey, here it's going to be free.
Does that make sense?
I like free.
And yeah, it would be a good promotion for the Halo 3 game.
What I also want to know, though, is can Master Chief be one of the guitarists that you can play as?
That would be cool.
That would be awesome.
Because it was pretty awesome to have Master Chief in Dead or Alive 4.
Well, it wasn't Master Chief.
Spartan.
Female Spartan.
Whatever.
You know, having a Halo character in the game was kind of funny.
So, Mistress Chief.
Sorry, my bad.
That would be Chieftess.
Anyway, so yes, one of my favorite topics of discussion is how people are hacking firmwares on consoles.
And one very famous group, Team Executor, one of the ones I think pioneered some of the homebrew stuff on the PSP,
have broken the firmware for the Xbox 360.
Now, right now, there's apparently a...
and they can't disclose too much but there is a glitch in one of the older firmwares for the 360 that will allow you to use a copy of King Kong to run your own code.
Kind of similar to what they're doing with some of the older firmwares on the PSP where you could run homebrew with Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.
Apparently one of the shaders I guess that was in King Kong was actually unsigned and so they could buffer overflow it and cause it to run their own
And they actually released a proof of concept, I think like Hello World or something like that, that you can run on your 360 if you happen to have this firmware.
And apparently there's a way to check it by going to your system menu and stuff like that.
But like I said, if you're getting your automatic updates on live like most people are, you probably have already patched the hole in this because the problem has been patched in some of the future firmwares.
So...
Basically, right now, there's no way to roll back the firmware, kind of like you can do on the PSP.
Although, if you have the older firmware, there is apparently a thing you can break on the motherboard or something that you can do that will allow you to be able to roll it back no matter what firmware you have later on.
So, I don't know.
I was going to say, can't Microsoft just patch this right away?
They can.
They're pretty good.
Of all the companies, they're the fastest at closing up these loopholes real quick.
Yeah.
At least on the 360, not so much Windows XP, but... And right now, really, I don't think there's a way, I mean, you can really detect this because it's, you know, it's being run in a game almost.
It's loading with a game, so unless they just ban the use of King Kong altogether, it's going to be pretty hard for them to, you know, stop it altogether.
I don't know, though.
But, I mean, they've already pretty much done, they've patched the whole for this, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Vulnerability, and it's found in kernel versions 4532 and 4548.
So apparently if you pull up your Xbox 360 under the system menu and look up system information, there's a little thing on the bottom of the screen.
It says D, and then there's a bunch of numbers, and then K and a bunch of numbers.
If your kernel says 2.0 point and then either the 40 or the, what was it,
Christ is a lot of specifics.
Oh yes, because the rampant piracy will certainly make the games even better.
That was sarcasm.
Hasn't hurt the PS2 anymore.
Or the PSP.
Well, there are some franchises that every so often will rear their ugly heads over the course of video gaming history.
Well...
Prince of Persia, not so stabity.
Just, you know, I was never a fan of the Prince of Persia games, so I'm like, wow.
They're not bad.
The new ones aren't bad.
I don't think they're quite like, oh my god, as a lot of people have said they are, but I played some of the older ones on GameTap.
They're not bad.
For a 3D action type game, they're pretty solid.
It was a pretty good game, and...
I don't know.
I can see why it does as well.
They have the one coming off the Wii, the Port of Two Thrones, I guess, but it rivals swords, I guess.
Calling it something new because they added some chariot racing in there.
But, I mean, if you like Prince Persia, that's going to be a pretty cool game to check out.
So, I don't know.
But another cool thing, though, about Prince of Persia is it's becoming a movie as well.
And Disney is behind this as well as Jerry Brockheimer.
They're bringing Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time.
And it is legit.
They've got some concept art on it.
That's pretty cool.
I mean, I think the Sands of Time... Didn't Disney already put out Aladdin?
Yes.
But I think it would be a pretty cool action movie.
I'm looking forward to it.
So, just don't fuck it up.
You might actually have, if they pull it off, you might have a really good movie translation for a game.
You know, because...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Also, of course, you can download movies on iTunes, and you can download music.
And for those wondering, where's all the gaming music?
Well, Electronic Arts has launched the EA Tracks service as a part of iTunes.
And basically what they've done is they've compiled all the EA games.
The interesting thing is they said, music from all EA games, past and present, now available on the iTunes Store.
Well, okay, but, you know, when you say all EA games past and present, that makes me go, wow, you mean I could even go to the ECA games from the Commodore 64 days?
No.
Basically what that means, like, you know, your burnouts, your sports games with the licensed music, you know, the Maddens.
Any of the games with EA tracks.
You got it.
Those EA tracks, you can download those songs on iTunes, so there you go.
Did you know that Burnout Dominator is supposed to have Avril Lavigne's girlfriend in it?
Which, oh boy.
That's a pretty bad song.
I like the last one she did for the movie, but this song's bad.
That's not something I would want the EA name on.
Would it make you want to crash into things?
That's a very good point.
If it's true that there's pedestrians in the next Burnout game, it would make me want to run over them.
Dominator would not have pedestrians.
Damn it!
Dominator's kind of a best-of built off the Revenge engine, I believe.

The first email of the week, without the sexy commentary, actually comes from... Email number one.
Hey Rob, shut up.
Comes from Heon.
Dear OLR, first of all, I absolutely love the show.
You guys are excellent radio show hosts and are very talented.
Thank you so much for making the show so fun by interacting with your audience.
On to my questions, Super Mario Bros., Ocarina of Time, Kid Icarus, A Link to the Past.
These are just several of the classics that are currently available on the North American Virtual Console.
It's been only four months.
The Wii still has four to five years to go.
At this rate, they're going to be scraping the bottom of the barrel near the end of its life.
I know that Nintendo's got a significant amount of masterpieces still to release on Virtual Console, but are they going too fast?
Sincerely, Heon.
P.S.
I am now a Pastafarian thanks to the show.
FSM lives.
Flying Spaghetti Monster.
Wow.
I fear the day that Marissa has influence on anyone.
All hail his noodley goodness.
Love you, Marissa.
Anyhow, actually, I actually... She'll be up here in two weeks.
She's coming back a lot sooner than we thought, so that's going to be a very interesting program.
Anyhow, back to the content of the email.
What was the email about again?
About if Nintendo's releasing... whatever, Rob.
Virtual console games coming out too fast or whatever's going on.
Right now, no.
I mean, keep in mind what we were talking about earlier in the program, that there's this big drought going on with the games.
And although Reggie Fils-Aimé lied and said we wouldn't have these droughts this time around, keep in mind one thing he did say is that the virtual console releases, the big ones, would supplement the lack of Wii games during these slow periods.
So I think right now, no, they're not necessarily doing the virtual console games too fast.
I think this was probably a pretty decent time to release Ocarina and Kid Icarus and some of those really big titles people want.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and hopefully someday we'll start getting the multiplayer add-ons.
Maybe some of our games will be enabled for multiplayer slowly but surely.
Maybe we'll get our cheat codes.
I could see that as something that happens slowly but surely in 2008.
I want Icarus to fight Medusa Angels.
And I want my Justin Bailey in Metroid.
And hopefully originals too.
Don't we want some Wii originals?
Some more original Wii games?
Heck yeah.
So that would be hopefully where the console goes in 2008 and 2009.
So we will see what happens.
Next email is very special.
Dear OLR crew, my name is Ranma from Indonesia.
I'm a classic video game lover.
I believe that I am probably the first person from Indonesia becoming one of your loyal fans.
Now I have to know.
I'm going to check stats.
Right now I'm working as a journalist in most of my articles about technology and video games.
I'm also working as a local video game music composer.
One thing that will probably surprise you is that I am blind.
I was born with only 10% sight ability after being operated.
Now how can I operate a computer?
I'm using screen reader that enables me to read objects shown on my laptop so I can read and write.
and even download your show.
When I was a child, I was so interested in video games because it had attractive sounds and graphics.
I even owned an Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, NES, Genesis and SNES.
With only 10% sight, I could still enjoy classic games.
I could not recognize objects or details, but I could still understand, for instance, which one is my hero and which one is the enemy.
I even finished many famous classic games such as Super Mario series, Contra Gradius,
and many more, but when 3D gaming era came out, Playstation, Nintendo 64 and Saturn, I decided to give up because I could not play games with so many movements.
After that, I decided to enjoy video games in other fashions.
I started to record or collect music from games I played.
I'll share you some of my listening later.
So now on to my comments about you guys.
Scroll down.
Well, I could not say a word but awesome.
Your podcast is the first experience enjoying video games news on an audio form.
I actually found your site last January and started to become your fan.
I even noticed some of your information.
I even quoted some of your information in my articles.
Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, you are the craziest gang I have ever loved.
I feel like having lots of friends video game folks that refreshes my energy and brain during the working hour.
You should know that not many Indonesians
Thank you for watching!

It takes advantage of stereo sound systems.
For example, if you're playing a spaceship battle game and your enemy is on your left, you can hear their ship on your left speaker and can shoot them.
You can also chase them if they dodge your attack.
Let's say they move from left to right.
I'm going to scroll down.
Again, pay attention to the speaker.
They did something like that with that Atari controller that you use your forehead to play.
And Sega did a couple of audio-only games on the Saturn.
You can try them here.
It's at audiogames.net.
I wonder if it can be DarkSakura's side of the week.
We'll see.
Well, I think that's all I can share.
I hope I keep in touch with you guys.
This email can be read on air.
As for joining your show via Skype, I think it is difficult because the connection, like I've mentioned before, is very slow to make such a call.
Plus the time difference.
Lastly, I'm working on an Xbox 360 project along with a local game developer at max-studio.net to produce independent games.
DarkSakura.com
Wow, what an amazing email.
That was really cool.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
They were talking about how they had a group of blind people riding their bicycle down the road using clicking to determine location of cars and other things in the road.
And that their study group actually managed to avoid children running out in the road, avoided trash in the street, by using their sense of hearing
to determine space relation around them.
They say that if you lose one capability, your other capabilities become so much more sensitive, so that really makes sense, I think.
I'd be very curious what this listener has to think about the Wii, because he does have at least the 10% site.
The Wii is interesting because it has that rumble and the speaker that's actually in the Wiimote, as well as the rumble, depending on where your cursor is on screen, that could help you identify if you're pointing at a certain object.
I imagine not all games would work, but I'm kind of curious, could the Wii maybe be something that would help bring this guy back into gaming, where the 3D games and the ultra-intensive graphics have kind of made him unable to play?
I would have never known about this type of site and the way they make these games.
and I guess I'm just ignorant that way.
I would have never known had it not been for this email.
So thank you very much for the email.
I'm going to check that site out just because I want to know.
I want to see what kind of games there are.
There have been other games, and I don't think they were necessarily brought out for the blind in particular, but Sega, there were a number of Saturn games that focused only on audio.
There was one game that came with a packet of seeds where you had to use the audio to raise a plant.
Very interesting.
Alpha Canogram reminds us, and SSJ100 Matt chimes in too, about how Ellen actually gave a blind kid a Wii on her show.
Remember that?
That was some gaming news a while back.
That was before the Wiis were even out.
So kind of an interesting reminder there from the chat room.
That's why we love chat, because they remember things and we don't.
Well, this next email comes from BearWhoDriveCar.
I love that name.
That's so great.
French fries, sorry.
Okay, I have to stop for just a minute.
Loki, what the hell is it?
You have DDR5thMix on your PSP?
Yeah.
What are you hacking over there?
I was putting a PS1 image on here.
I didn't know it... God, I'm so far behind on my PlayStation.
Dang, you mean if I get a card you can do that with PlayStation 1 games for my PSP?
Yeah, you put a custom firmware on there and you can convert any PS1 image to play on a PSP given that you have the big enough... Now my next question for you is why the fuck do you have
and DDDR on your PSP.
So I can play with the controller.
That's how I play normally.
Back to the emails.
Sorry.
Anyway.
Yo, just writing to Vent about the Wii.
I do like it, but you guys mentioned that there are too many controllers.
Well, I can't agree more.
First, I got Super Mario Bros.
with the Wiimote.
It's kind of odd because of the shape and size, but that was okay.
Then I got Smash Bros.
Melee, and all of a sudden, to play multiplayer, I needed two GameCube controllers.
Okay, not too bad.
Then I bought Contra, and that's when I noticed if you try to play with the GameCube controller, I try to play with the GameCube controller, but if you recall the locations, the YB on SNES and Game Boy controllers are totally different.
By the way, I hate the GameCube controller and its asymmetrically sized buttons.
So now I have to buy a Wii Classic controller, two for multiplayer.
I've also purchased three Wiimotes and four Nunchucks.
So, Nintendo Wii, $250, three Wiimotes, $120, four Nunchucks, $80.
I get the point, but at the same time, you didn't have to buy the controllers.
You just didn't like the way it felt on the GameCube controllers.
And again, you're not forced to even buy Contra or any Super Nintendo game at all.
Whereas PlayStation 3...
You have to buy a Blu-ray drive, like it or not.
and so on and so on.
But if you want to get a wireless headset, that's more money.
And I say, yeah, you kind of do need that wireless headset if I want to play DDR or so on.
So anyhow, interesting point, but I think a slightly flawed one.
I don't know.
I think that there's something to it, but it all depends on how far you'll go for the sake of convenience.
Anyway, next email comes up.
Actually, could I just say some quick points from chat that came up here?
Let's see what's going on.
Heon wants to start a fight here.
You are not good enough for the GameCube controller, you noob.
And Blaze says, boo-fucking-hoo, do your research before you buy a system.
So a couple of people throwing some rocks there.
Sky Warrior, that's with a Y, not an I, says, value, what makes the Wii so compelling?
Too bad the PlayStation 3 has no value as of now.
Very interesting.
And some interesting comments there from the chat room there.
James Patrick says, a lot of Wii games only need one remote and you pass it around.
So, kind of interesting there.
Ooh, food.
And also they have games, they have games like coming out now like Wing Island and Kororimpa that use one remote and nunchuck for two players.
So, they've got all that stuff going on.
Jamie's got a mouth.
I don't want that now after you put your mouth all over it.
I only ate off one side of it.
It's fine.
It doesn't look that good anyway.
I'm starting South Beach tomorrow again.
Anyway.
Anyway.
Last email.
This email actually is not the last one.
It comes from Necky.
really the one thing that I wanted to go in here and it's a really long email and this is going to be one that I'm going to leave on the website but I wanted to mention this I like the idea of telling people now you've posted a site plug for you on my home forum dscommunity.co.uk to plug the site for them and xbox360fanatics link is z6.envisionfree.com slash 360 underscore fanatics slash index dot php
We are currently quite small, but invite everyone to join no matter where you are, and that includes you, Jamie, Loki, and Rob.
I wanted to do that, though, just because Neki writes us regularly, and I'm going to be posting this in the thing, but I thought that it would be nice for me to go ahead and give the little plug.
There's also another bit in here that says, I remember the first email of last from the taped segment was a loving rant about the last few episodes.
I, too, feel slightly likewise, but I agree.
with you, Jamie and Rob, that it does keep your show unique.
Inviting Casper the Gay and Rice Princess every week may not be such a good idea, though.
I do not hold anything against them, but having them on every week would alter many people's views of your show.
Well, that's why these folks are guests, not hosts.
They said it out of love, not hate.
Gotcha.
Anyway, that one's going to get reposted.
Sorry, I'm actually trying to do a search.
I want to see where this post comes up.
I'm looking at this site.
DScommunity.co.uk.
That's a whole little DS.
And I imagine there's lots of friend code training going on.
Oh, here it is.
There's actually a forum called Plug A Site.
And there's this post there.
Great site for podcasts and live shows focusing on video gaming.
Podcasts available on iTunes.
MP3 download available on actual website.
Covers release dates for most of the world.
Most are accurate as they have insider sources.
One of the guys works for a game distribution company.
Good fun to listen to, especially when you have nothing to do or on a commute.
I like that.
Orange Launch Radio, better than nothing.
Yeah.
No, thank you very much for the plug.
We appreciate that.
You are a true veteran of the OL Army, and we salute you.
We got an email from Gaming Nerd about... Nerd.
Hey, now.
Anyway...
Hey, OLR, I know this is kind of a risky subject to mention, but I feel it must be heard so that people understand what could be happening in the future in gaming.
After listening to Loki's rant in the last week's episode about there not being any good games for PS3 and 360, and only average ones, it got me looking back at the numerous anonymous sites that I've been to.
I'm finding it pretty easy to download pirated PS2 and Xbox games off the net and burning them to DVD-Rs and playing them on modded consoles.
Knowing how easy it is to download PS2 and Xbox games, it gets you wondering just how much money game companies are losing just from these two consoles.
With that loss in money, there's only so much money that can be spent to produce average titles with the kind of graphics power and development tools that are provided for the PS3 and 360.
It's no wonder that Wii is overtaking the competition with its console for the simple reason that GameCube ran games off any unique media that wasn't easily accessible to the public.
Thus, more money was earned
Thank you for watching!
It'll only be a matter of time before we see a Blu-ray burner and PS3 games get pirated.
A mod chip is released to the console, which will result in even more money lost to the companies that make their games for the PS3.
I'm even more surprised the Japanese market isn't complaining about piracy, but that you could only mean there's much more loyalty to gaming than some of us here in the States.
Especially when it comes to buying my PS2 imports, I'm more than willing to spend $64 to buy games like Puyo Puyo Fever 2
MeltyBlood, DDR Supernova, Beatmania2DX and supporting the companies that made these games and like most people that I've heard who just go ahead and download imports since they either can't find the store that sells them or don't want to spend an extra $14 off everyday $50 US titles that might have just come out.
Anyways, I hope this letter gives a better understanding as to why big names aren't really as big anymore as it partially is due to the loss of money and loss of quality for the games themselves.
I can remember when it was really big news for a game like Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo, and Final Fantasy to get new sequels.
But nowadays, it's just the same thing because there is enough money to do much else in the games.
Unique aspects are gone and there's not much else we can say about gaming other than stop the piracy and the magical return.
You're truly a gaming nerd.
It's not often you hear from people who are willing to defend the fact that video game piracy is a bad thing.
So, very interesting email.
Don't copy that floppy.
As a famous musician once said, Loki, I'm curious what your feedback is on this whole piracy is bad for the industry angle.
Sure, it's bad for the industry, but, you know, to be honest, nowadays, a lot of stuff, if it's not worth playing, I won't even go and pirate it or anything like that.
I'll just not play it, but, I mean...
I guess, I buy normally, I mean, I buy a lot of stuff that just comes out and I find out, you know, the hard way that a lot of the games do suck.
So I can see where a lot of people get burned by these games that, you know, get great reviews and they're like, what the fuck, this is crap.
Driver 3, for example.
Yeah, piracy is, especially if you make it so easy like it is on the PlayStation 2 or even the original PlayStation, yeah, it's going to be a huge issue, but
I don't know.
It's all morals.
If you think stealing's bad, then you're not going to do it.
Bandit says, bad for the industry, but good for Loki.
In our chatroom.
GS68 says, I buy legit copies, though I admit I've done my share of ROM downloading.
I think ROMs are not quite as bad.
In fact, they're really not as bad, because usually the things you're pirating ROMs of, I mean, if you're doing current DS games, that's one thing.
DDR5thMix Virtual Console
I have a ROM of Kid Icarus on my computer.
I don't like to play Kid Icarus on my computer.
I like to play it on my television like I did when I was a kid.
So for that, it was worth the $5 to me because I love Kid Icarus that much.
To be honest, I've got to play PS1 games on my PSP because what else am I going to play?
Grand Theft Auto?
I mean, seriously.
What else is out for the PSP?
A whole lot of stuff I'm not interested in.
It sounds like a lot of stuff coming soon, though.
Soon.
It's always coming soon.
Whatever, whatever.
Anyway, may I read the next email?
You sure may.
Thank you.
Last email.
Hiya, guys.
I just want to know what it is that we in Europe and Australia have done to piss off Sony.
Whatever it was, I'm sure we could apologize.
It's the funny accents.
No, shut up.
Maybe come to some kind of arrangement.
You don't get this kind of treatment in America.
How come?
Is it cash bribes, sexual favors?
I'm sure you know why it is I'm feeling hard done by.
I was accepting of the higher price tag.
We are used to that.
Also, the late release date, I've only just bought my copy of Final Fantasy XII.
We're used to having to wait.
Waiting longer to pay extra for an inferior piece of hardware is taking the biscuit.
Full backwards compatibility.
Well, there's another thing.
You call it a biscuit.
I mean, come on.
Rob!
My expression is take the cake.
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
Shut up.
What?
I'm just, obviously I'm kidding.
Come on.
Stuff it!
Thank you.
I'm going to flip Jamie off the British way.
There you go.
Up your arse.
Hey, two-finger salute for you.
You're being a real tit.
Don't be such a tit.
I'm done.
I promise.
To use a bit of proper colloquialism, Rob's doing my head in here.
So shall I continue?
I suppose.
Okay.
Wanker.
Full backwards compatibility was one of the biggest selling...
Points for the PS2 from me and would have been on the PS3.
Being able to play a session of San Andreas and putting on Bishi Bashi Special if mates come over without switching consoles or messing with wires is important to me.
Oh yes, this guy.
Yes.
Amazing work.
Bandit calls this whole thing bullocks.
That's what Bandit has to say about it.
You know, here's why... I offered you some.
Don't give me that look.
What?
You look at my cupcake.
It looks like a yummy cupcake, but I don't want it.
Cupcakes make me fat.
I don't want it.
You put your fingers all over that cupcake.
You haven't even, like, torn off the paper.
You've just dived into the cupcake.
I asked you if you wanted some, and you said no, so I started licking the ice.
Don't be such a twat.
I think the reason why Europe gets shit on is I think they sell the least amount of consoles there.
The end.
Right?
Am I right?
No.
Loki says I'm wrong.
I would think that's what it is.
I don't know.
Don't they sell more consoles in Japan and America than they do in Europe?
Maybe.
I guess it depends what you consider to be Europe.
Do you consider Europe to be everything on the other side of the Atlantic?
Or do you consider Europe to be, you know... I just think that they think that their U.S.
and Japan markets are more important than their U.K.
markets, and they want to make sure they have enough consoles for us because we're spending more money on games.
I always said the TVs, too, because the Japan and U.S.
share the same TV format standard, whereas NTSC... It doesn't matter with HD.
If Sony's really pushing the HD format, then having PAL or NTSC is not going to matter.
But, not everybody has an HD TV yet, so the systems have to work with the old TVs, whether they are this, you know, whoring up the HD signal or not.
That should be pretty easy to do, though.
I would think.
Just a thought.
I'm just processing a lot here.
They have to figure out what components they're going to take out of your PS3 so that they can lower the price on their end.
That's what they have to do.
Alright, well.
We don't know.
I mean, that's a Sony question.
We've given you our thoughts, though.
And regardless, it's not nice that they keep giving you the shaft over there on the different games.
Rob.
What?
I'm sorry, no.
Look, the international listeners ought to know I love them.
I tease because I love.
And as somebody in chats, I don't even know who said this here.
Who said my accents were so bad they were good?
Somebody there said my accents are so bad they're funny.
Uni says Sky's accents are like my mom trying to do a British accent and completely miserably failing at it.
Oh goody, now I'm like your mom.
That's a very nice compliment.
Like your mom.
Orange Lounge Radio, it's like your mom.
Go leave that on an iTunes review.
I want one of our British listeners to record that for us so that we can make a bumper out of it.
We need to bring back the bumpers.
I miss the bumper.
I know.
Orange Lingerie.
I was like your mom.
I could do that better.
I could do that better.
All right.
Sorry.
Forget it.
No, seriously.
I could.
Any more emails?
That was it, right?
Mailbag at OrangeLingerie.com.
Send us more.
Send emails.
My accent wants some fan mails.
We need to do one that says, you lose because we say so.
So... So anyways, apparently the rumor is much like the, you know, online libraries, they are also withholding the Mii libraries for the Nintendo Wii from third-party developers and not letting them develop games that will utilize the Miis, which is kind of disappointing because I would like to use my Miis in a lot more things than just, you know, Wii Sports or WarioWare, I guess.
But, um...
I don't see why they don't.
Don't use your me's in Grand Theft Auto.
Oh my god, that would be awesome.
That would be so cool.
Even stuff just like maybe your face or something on SSX Blur or something like that.
Or your mom.
You could literally put your mom in the game.
Something like that, yeah.
So, I don't know why they don't.
I think it's stupid, but if it's anything like the online stuff was, they want to make sure they get it right first before they put it out to everybody.
Which is a poor excuse if you ask me, but whatever.
So, I'm sure, like the online, it'll be something that's implemented later on.
So, you know, while it may not be happening now, it will happen later.
Yeah, the third parties will get their me's soon enough.
Although I agree, they should have had it from the start.
Well, um...
GameTap, we mentioned in Part A when I was talking about Myst Online, and what should be noted is that GameTap is also now starting to really get behind the independent game movement.
Seems like a really good fit for GameTap, if you ask me.
Well, GameTap has announced they're going to be doing a new indie game label, and what they're going to do, they're going to sign and distribute any worthy indie project over the GameTap service.
And this would be a really great way to get your game out there, because GameTap has their user base.
They won't say how big it is, which makes me think it's not that big.
GameTap.com
So that's kind of cool.
So, Loki, is this something that might get you on GameTap finally?
Nope.
I don't have time to be paying for online monthly subscriptions for games.
I thought I'd ask anyway.
Well, excuse me.
I'm sorry, I was just choking up a baby.
Okay.
Apparently this show has that effect on people.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I just coughed up a baby listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
They were talking about babies flying out of vaginas in one part, and in the second part, they coughed up a baby.
It's amazing.
Anyway, there is some love coming out thanks to SNK.
Art of Fighting actually is going to be having a collection to be released stateside.
Art of Fighting was a very interesting game because it was a big, definite knockoff in some respects of Street Fighter II, what with, you know, Rio and Robert Garcia and all of them.
Of course, the two of them also gave us Dan and later ones, too.
But I don't know.
It's kind of cool.
I always liked Art of Fighting because they did name a fighter after me.
Having a Rob in a fighting game was pretty cool.
I also like that old school zoom in and out effect it did.
Art of Fighting, though, gave us King.
That's right.
And King was awesome.
Big ol' lesbian.
And Yuri.
Mm-hmm.
With the flying butt attack.
Gotta love flying butt attacks.
In fact, I'm gonna do a flying butt attack on DarkSakura right now.
Get your ass off me!
I've been rubbed with gay ass.
Anyways, if you like ridiculous weapons much like Rob's flying butt attack, then you're definitely going to love Worms HD, which is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
Speaking of ass worms.
Finally, this Wednesday.
So that is awesome.
It's supposed to be 800 Microsoft points or $10 in real money.
And it's awesome.
It's Worms.
It's 2D.
And, yeah, I can't wait to play it.
Oh lord, bless this thy hand grenade
Sam & Max GameTap
Now, Telltale Games finally said something this week about the whole thing.
They said they will, quote, look closely at releasing a potential Sam & Max project.
Quote, we can confirm that we are hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, although we do not have any official Xbox project announcements to share right now.
Well, I would think if they're hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, they've got something planned.
And what else?
DarkSakura's Website of the Week
My website of the week is a marvelously special one.
It is marvel.com, which I've been spending a whole shitload of time on.
Downloading, actually mostly just downloading wallpaper.
But they have, I think it's cool, they actually have some of the, I'd say comics from like a few months ago uploaded so that you can read them.
They have links to the toys, the movie news.
There's blogs up there, podcasts, stuff for mobile.
It's actually pretty cool.
I've been pretty happy with it.
So I'd say check it out.
It's really fun.
For a commercial site.
Alright.
What, are you surprised?
No, I'm just reading chat.
I'm arguing with Black Wolf right now in chat.
Hey, Rob, do your job.
Loki's friend is fighting me in chat right now, Loki's one friend, saying that it's going to be hard to fit Sam and Max on Xbox Live Arcade because of the size limit.
And I said, well, they upped the size limit to 250 megabytes, remember?
And BlackWolf says, yes, they'd have to make it more, though.
And BlackWolf says, I just don't want 360 people to get my Sam and Max hard game tab.
Ah, so that's sort of true.
You don't want people to have your Loki, and you don't want people to have your Sam and Max.
You are a very
Possessive individual, Mr. Bobby Blackwolf
So apparently they've spotted a couple games on the Vice, or I see VC and I think Vice City.
Virtual console servers, because I know you can still do that little hack with the web browsers to view what's on those.
But anyways, two games that have been spotted, one of them being Elevator Action, which is pretty awesome, and then Tecmo Bowl.
No, it's not.
Elevator Action sucks.
It's one of those games people remember.
No, Tecmo Bowl.
Oh, Tecmo Bowl's awesome.
Yeah, fuck Elevator Action.
Tecmo Bowl on the NES was awesome, but Tecmo Bowl on the arcade was not so awesome.
Because I have the Tecmo Bowl arcade game on some Tecmo collection I have on the Xbox randomly, but Tecmo Bowl on NES was pretty rad.
So I'm looking forward to seeing that.
That would be pretty cool.
Elevator Action, not so much.
Elevator Action was not that good.
Rob the Robot Rob the Robot
How about Rob Roberts, the bot?
That'd be good.
No.
They need to bring back... How about a Jamie bot where it just nags you to do things?
That would be a woman bot, okay?
Turn on your system!
Download this upgrade!
No!
I only called you once today to ask you to turn on your aim so I could send you the fucking pre-show.
Do not be a bitch to me, Rob.
Turn on your AOL.
If you think that I'm going to download your updates for you, you're completely wrong.
I'm an independent woman.
I'll do what I want.
I'm setting up in the middle of your game now.
I love this show.
I really, really love this show.
All right.
My battle aura has... All your memes have been deleted.
I have a power level of over 4,000 now, Rob.
I love you, Jamie.
The hell you do!
And JamieBot, and JamieBot.
The hell you do.
You treat me like this.
Look, here, look.
Jamie, I got a story that'll make you happy because I know you love Zork and Leisure Suit Larry.
Who doesn't love Leisure Suit Larry?
And King's Quest?
Actually, I never really played any of them except for the first Zork.
Can't you just play along?
Vodka.
Vodka.
I don't think Vodka was a game.
Okay, well how about the Indiana Jones?
Vodka cures PMS!
Maniac Mansion?
Yeah, I love Maniac Mansion.
There we go.
Well, Maniac Mansion, I'm sure there'll be a mention of it at AdventureCon.
But news alert!
AdventureCon is an adventure game convention that's going to happen August 28th and 29th at the Mirage Hotel right on the Vegas Strip.
It's going to be two days of adventure game nerdom.
There's actually going to be a Zork room.
Because basically AdventureCon had started out as a 30th birthday celebration for Zork And so they decided to, it kind of grew into this all-encompassing adventure game thing Kind of like how Orange Lingerie started about music games, but now we're all video games because we did that So, there you go That's kind of neat And this, by the way, this is the first AdventureCon So it started off being a Zork thing, now it's this whole big thing because they're actually going to have Al Lowe from Sierra there
Jane Jensen, the creator of the Gabriel Knights games.
It's pretty rad.
I did not realize that Zork 1 was written in 1977.
The White House with a mailbox here seems so, so long ago.
Hey, Rob.
What?
I just unleashed a grew in your underwear.
Thank you.
It's squishy.
Anyway, moving on for some different news.
The games for Windows Live Beta sign-up is now open.
It's the Microsoft PC version of Xbox Live, and the two are going to be tied together for cross-platform play.
So go check it out if you are not blessed enough to console game with the rest of us cool kids.
And...
Yeah, I will not be checking this out because I do not have Vista.
I do not want Vista.
Nor do I want to play PC.
Do not want!
But, what's kind of cool though, everyone remembers Wii Kade, that Flash... Wait, I have to say this real fast.
You know why I don't want Windows Vista?
Because I do not want my computer to look like those god-awful Heroes previews that were brought to us by Windows Vista.
That turned me off to Windows Vista.
I was like, what have you done to my Heroes?
Do not want!
and SimulatedVista.
Your offering has not pleased Kitty!
More!
No more!
Do not want!
So WeCade, a flashlight that has games made for the Wii browser.
Well, they've just opened up a downloadable API that will allow developers of other Flash games to use the Wii Remote's buttons for actual gameplay.
Before, it used to be limited to kind of mouse games that use only the A button for clicking and stuff like that.
But now they've actually figured out how to use every single button on the Wii Remote, which is pretty fucking awesome.
So hopefully we'll see some pretty cool games come from this.
and hopefully I will actually work on OLRWee.com at some point.
You had to do that because there was some website I saw that had all these popular Wii game things listed or something and I did not see OLRWee.com and I remembered, oh yeah, there's nothing on it.
Sorry.
Crackdown.
It's been a problem.
By the way, going back to the last story, it was commented in our chat room, Loki does not have friends on Vista.
Where's Black Wolf now, Loki?
BlackWolf even made that comment, so you got no friends now.
I don't have Vista.
Oh, no.
It's a joke.
Well, here's the thing, though.
Windows Live, you remember, is part of the Live Anywhere, so technically I have a lot more friends on Games for Windows Live than I do for actual the PS3 network.
So, ha, I do have friends on there, and I don't even have it.
Something that you can't play with friends, although I think it would be fun if you could.
It's a SimCity DS.
Actually, I don't know much about this.
Perhaps maybe you can play with friends.
Oh, there is wireless data exchange in this game.
I stand corrected.
So you can play with friends.
SimCity DS.
It has officially been announced that it will be coming to the U.S.
Yay!
Other things that SimCity DS allows you to do.
You can blow out fires by blowing on the DS's microphone.
Doesn't that actually keep fires going?
Ah, forget it.
You sign off proclamations using the stylus.
That's fun.
So there you have it.
That will be coming out in June, by the way.
So that's a nice little translation time between Japan and the U.S.
there.
Because I believe this game just came out in Japan like last week.
But I have to admit I'm not as excited about this game because it's based off the SimCity 2000 engine.
And I didn't like SimCity when it went 3D.
It was too much for my feeble brain to handle.
Bring me my old school 2D, SimCity.
I actually have it on virtual console and I never play it because yeah, I get sucked into other games like World of Warcraft.
Well, you know, that's just because you're an addict, Rob.
How about a different game?
How about Darwinia?
Darwinia, as announced by Introversion, is going to be multiplayer in 2008.
Excuse me.
It's a
Set for release on its own, it's called Multiwinia.
We'll let you play cooperatively or competitively.
The number of people on, they're not really sure how much they're going to be able to handle, but they're hoping that they're going to go really, really massive.
I'm going to, you know, reserve judgment for actually seeing it, you know.
They're saying that there's a quote by John Nottenbelt saying that it will let you organize your Darwinians into ranks and create massive armies.
So that would be kind of cool.
I don't know.
I'm still going to reserve judgment for actually seeing it.
Is that a free game?
I can't remember.
Was Darwinia a free one?
I believe it was.
Somebody in chat I'm sure knows because I believe some folks ought to know what's going on there.
But, um,
Let me see if anybody in chat can answer my question there.
Oh, they say no it wasn't.
I think you could download a demo for free is what it was.
Hitstun says Darwinia had a demo but the game was $20.
Because I was going to see if it was something I wanted to check out.
I'll check out the demo because I'm kind of curious.
By the way, I'm very proud of Miklatov because he's been unlocking achievements in Crackdown for me while this show's been going on.
So he got me this First Blood achievement which I didn't have and Bare Knuckle Brawler
Kill 150 gang members with your bare hands.
Nice.
So if you wondered how I was on Xbox Live during the show, it's actually Miklatov playing Crackdown right now.
Awesome.
But I have more achievements than you do at Crackdown.
Alrighty.
Yeah, you have a shitload of achievements in Crackdown.
That's great.
Well, I have more achievements than you do in Universe.
Oh, God, I can't believe I didn't mention this at the top of the show.
That's all right.
Nobody gets to the end of the show.
Do you know who I got a message from on Xbox Live while I was playing DDR Universe?
No.
Strip Club DJ.
Do you know who that person is?
He is like the guy who was like, for a long time, he was the number one gamer points holder on all of Xbox Live, right?
He has over 100,000 gamer score.
I got a message from him, and it said simply, can you use the joystick on DDR?
Because I think he's probably contemplating, do I want to get DDR to get the 1,000 achievement points out of?
So I replied.
I replied with a voice message, though.
But I said something like, yes, you can, but obviously you're supposed to use the dance pad, but if you're just trying to run through the game, you'll probably just want to use the controller.
But I said something about quest mode sucking and a lot of the unlocks coming through that.
Yeah, see, I was stupid, and I told somebody there was like 75 unlocks, because in quest mode it says 0 of 75 for music stuff.
That's how much you own, or how many songs you own in quest mode, right?
That's what it is.
When you buy a song in quest mode to have the advantage in quest mode, that's... See, the game doesn't fucking explain any of this.
That's why quest mode sucks.
I didn't even know what the hell that meant.
That's what it means.
So, there you go.
But that was kind of funny to get a message from him, because I guess, apparently, at one point, and I looked at my gamercard.net right after that, because that's the one that ranks... I was apparently, like, number six or seven in the world for gamer score earned in DDR Universe.
Really?
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But nobody has all 1,000 yet.
I only have 480 points in the game.
It's not that hard.
I mean, I could probably, if I really just sat down and played it, I could probably crank out the whole game in one day.
I mean, not that I'm not, you know, I may think achievement points are fun and all, and, you know, they kind of add something to the game, but I would not consider myself an achievement point whore, so to speak.
So it was kind of just interesting that I was, I did show up on there and got contacted by Strip Club DJ.
Okay.
True Achievement Points Horror because of it.
So, interesting.
Anyhow, we're going to open up the Skype line.
If you want to give us a call and interact with our program, you can do so.
The number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can always use Skype to give us a call.
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
If you want more information on that, you can visit www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
and we'll wait for some calls to start coming in.
While we wait for someone to come in, does anybody have a last minute story?
Yep.
What do you want, Jamie?
Well, Loki had one first, right?
Just real quick.
Just one story for now and then we'll get to some other calls.
Just real quick.
In God of War 2, someone had gotten the game out before it's come out and on the back of the manual there it says God of War PSP coming 2007.
So, confirm it is coming on the PSP.
Alright, there you have it.
Now we can go to the phones.
Um,
Legend of Zaku You already know about that gold is going to be released tomorrow for the location test, right?
Yeah, we mentioned that on last week's show.
Why?
No, I mean, they're all saying that, you know, from what I'm hearing right now, is that, you know, it has to do really good in order for it to actually move any further.
It's like a one-shot deal at the moment right now.
Well, but wait a minute, though.
I mean, what about those arcades that import Japanese games anyway, like Arcade Infinity and whatever that one is on the East Coast that was...
So this is the one that might tip the scale.
Well, what city is it in again?
It's somewhere in Illinois, right?
Naperville.
Naperville?
Yeah.
In Illinois?
Yeah, it's near Benson's location, nearby Chicago.
All right, well, if you are in the Chicago, Naperville area, and you are a music video game fan, and you want to see Beatmania make a U.S.
debut in arcades, you've got to go.
You've got to help out.
If you want to see it out, go through.
I'm through on it.
All right.
Well, thank you for the reminder, Mr. Zaku.
I unfortunately cannot attend.
Chicago's a little far.
Several thousand miles.
I know there's probably no one who's hearing this right now.
That's very true.
We do have the luxury of being not too far from L.A.
where we can drive for six hours to play 2DX Gold whenever they get it.
If they don't already have it, I don't even know.
I haven't actually followed B-Mania in a while, sadly.
Right.
All right.
Well, anything else, Zaku?
Um, just Sony's rumbling about why they just, why they didn't bother to settle quickly with immersion rather than just wait till they drop the PS3.
Pride.
Pride is more like they were banking on some, you know, on a sinking ship called their lawsuit.
Well, remember that Rumble is so last gen.
Well, that's, they're spinning it in, they're in denial.
It's like a little kid, they know they fucked up, and so they're just like, they don't want to admit it.
They don't want to admit they fucked up badly.
And that's why, you know, PS3 is not even worth getting right now, not even for another year.
Alright.
Well, Zaku, thank you very much for the call, and good luck with your 2DX Gold promotion.
Alright, thank you.
Alright, let's go to another phone call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hey, what's up, guys?
It's the Rob D. Hi, Rob D. Are you still bitter about your loss from last week?
Eh, not so much.
All right, I'm just giving you a hard time.
Loki did a good job on that.
You were a very good sport about the whole thing.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Not too much.
Just wondering what you guys thought about the news about the 20 gigabyte PS3 being possibly discontinued.
I don't know if you heard about that.
We actually did cover it in part A. I don't know if Bobby's show ran long tonight or what.
I suck then.
It's okay.
I've actually been busy recording some stuff, but that's a different story altogether.
That's alright, we'll forgive you.
You know, I don't... The 20 gig model, I mean, it was not something I was interested in anyway, so I'm a little bit, you know, kind of about the whole thing anyway.
I think, to be honest, the 20 gig model is just as good as the 60 gig as far as what's available for it.
I mean, if I were the
Buy one.
I would pick the 20 gig.
I have a 20 gig, and it's great.
I mean, it's not like I have to worry about filling up with downloads because there's nothing to download on it.
Well, isn't the 60 gigabyte version supposed to have dual HDMI ports?
Oh, wait.
No, it doesn't.
No, I'm kidding.
That's what they said on E3.
But, yeah.
Other than that, that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about.
All right.
Well, thank you very much for the call, Rob D. We appreciate it.
Thank you for taking my call.
See you guys later.
No problem.
Have a good week.
Bye.
All right.
Bye.
All right.
If you want to give a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you got to call.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
DarkSakura, why don't you throw us your last minute story while we're waiting for a call?
Well, it was actually something posted by TigerClaw in the chat room during the break.
Activision released a screenshot from the new Transformers game that they're putting out.
Um, yeah, it makes my heart break.
I'm not gonna like the movie, I don't think.
It doesn't look like Transformers.
And the game makes my heart hurt.
What's so bad about it?
What isn't so bad about it?
Oh my god, did you see it?
No.
What did it look like?
It's fucking awesome is what it is.
The fuck it is?
That does not look like Bumblebee.
It looks like a bee's head and, like, junk.
I can't wait to see this movie.
It's going to be awesome.
I know.
It's awesome.
I mean, I'll go see it because I have to, but God!
Fucking ugly.
All right.
Well, let's go to another call here on the Skype line and see what you folks have to say.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Whoa.
You guys can hear me?
Hi, yes, we can hear you.
What's up?
Hey, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.
What's on your mind?
Oh, not that much.
I got a Wii for Valentine's Day.
Oh, Wii-ly!
Yes, Wii-ly!
It's a nice little present, too, I figured.
What did you think?
Oh, me and a girlfriend love it a lot.
We play mostly Wii Sports, Wii Play, and we're also getting into Metal Slug Anthology.
My big thing was that, did somebody in the show...
I said the Metal Slug Anthology stunk.
The what?
No.
It's awesome.
I haven't played Metal Gear Anthology.
I think, I'm sorry, Metal Slug Anthology.
I think what we said on the show is that Kropotkin and Hendrix reviewed it this week.
We were teasing the all games thing because they play Kropotkin and Hendrix between our show.
But I don't know if they said it sucked.
I unfortunately did not get a chance to hear their show yet this week.
I don't think they did though.
I think they liked it.
Yeah, it's pretty much better than the other emulations that came out for the other systems because in most of the emulated versions, like the Xbox for example, there were loading times in between each level.
This one has none.
It just pretty much comes into the game and plays it straight through.
So it's exactly like the arcade.
Interesting.
What else on the Wii have you been playing?
So obviously Metal Slug Anthology.
I tried the Wii Sports and the Wii Play.
We play, it's alright.
It was just waiting for the other controller, you know.
Gotcha.
Yeah, but the Wii Sports is a blast.
What do you think the Wii's chances are against the 360 and the PlayStation 3?
Now, you live, where was it that you live again?
New York, right nearby where Ranma lives.
Oh, okay.
What do you think, I thought for some reason you were in another country.
What do you think the chances are of the Wii doing against the 360 and the PS3 in the long run?
If they can get better games that just don't rely on the Wii controls, but rather make something like the original stuff and a good third-party support, yeah, it's definitely going to be a lamp for a while.
All right.
And not just thought of as a party system, you know?
All right.
Anything else you want to share with our listeners, my friend?
One question.
Yes.
What was the exact difference with Zelda on the GameCube and the Wii?
Everything is right-handed on the Wii and left-handed on the GameCube.
So they have the same graphics and music and all that?
Actually, no.
The GameCube does not support the 16x9.
Everything will be in the square as well, and that's why the graphics suffer a little bit.
Oh, okay.
So there you go.
All right.
All right.
Well, thank you so much for the call, buddy, and enjoy the Wii.
Thanks.
See you guys.
Later.
Later.
All right, we'll try at least one more call here on the Skype line.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
It's deep breathing.
Sorry, it's me.
It's Uni.
I thought it was an erotic phone call.
Who's this?
This is Uni.
Hi, Uni.
What's on your mind, buddy?
I was wondering about something.
You know, I was thinking about getting a PS3, but you know how crappy they are?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, what might be swaying your mind on this?
Well, I do play a lot of PS2 games on my PS2 and everything.
It's just, I don't know why I would want to buy one other than it enhances the graphics on your PS2 games.
And even for a while it was de-hancing them, if you might remember that thing a while back.
It's like, why should you buy one?
Because they're like a 300 or 400, maybe 500 piece of crap, really.
I'm just thinking about what I should buy because I'm not really sure yet.
I don't think the PlayStation 3 is worth it at the time.
Again, you've got to remember the golden rule of gaming here at Orange Lingerie.
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
So it's really about what type of games you want to play.
I mean, if first-person shooters are your thing, oh my god, Xbox 360 all the way.
If you want something that's a little more light-hearted, fun type of games, the Wii is very your active system type of game.
And then, of course, you've got the PlayStation 3, which doesn't have a lot right now.
It's thought that a little later on down the line, its strengths will be role-playing games and so on, just like it was on PlayStation 2.
But right now, not a lot going for it.
And you've got Microsoft trying to step it up with what they were lacking with the Xbox the first time around.
So...
They're talking about bringing out another MMO from Square Enix called Final Fantasy XIII.
I'm not really sure about it.
I mean, it might bring me back to Square Enix, but they're really sitting on their thumbs most of the time when you're calling a GM on Final Fantasy XI.
I've been playing WoW, and when you call a GM, it's like that.
You know, you
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Final Fantasy XIII Versus is not going to be online.
I think it's going to be more of a Kingdom Hearts-ish game.
But that sounds pretty hot to me.
Final Fantasy XIII probably will be the game that gets me on PlayStation.
I also heard that Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories is coming to the PS2.
I saw the trailer for it.
There's a big trailer for it on YouTube.
It's completely redone, full style for the Kingdom Hearts games.
It's really, really awesome looking.
If I can remember where to find it, I should see if I can't repost the YouTube link.
I'm very curious to check this out myself.
It is freaking awesome.
You should check it out.
It better be.
Because if I'm rebuying Kingdom Hearts 2 for it, it better be.
Alright, well, Yuni, thanks so much for the call, and take care, and good luck on your system hunting.
You too, thank you.
Bye-bye.
Alright, let's see if we get any more calls.
Ring, ring, ring.
Oh, well, that must be on the back line.
Hi, who's this?
This is Shane.
Oh, hey, Shane's standing right in front of me.
Hi, Shane.
Hi.
A.K.A.
Miklatov.
We can't call you Miklatov anymore.
Well, I had to change it because I'm trying to get into a pump group, and there was already a Miklatov in pumps, so I have to go buy my
More recent nickname of Arx.
Well, whatever the hell your name is.
That's why I just go by Shane.
Alright, then what do you want?
Crackdown's the best game ever.
I love it.
That's what's on my mind.
Yeah, I saw you unlock some achievements for me.
I appreciate that.
Heck yeah, it's so much fun.
I wasn't really getting into it.
What really do you love about this game?
You can jump really high, and you jump across rooftops, and you're like the tick, that superhero.
Was it just because I hadn't leveled up enough that I couldn't do it?
No, I think you just didn't understand what you were doing, and...
You're right, I didn't.
You're supposed to go and shoot people and kick them and jump from roof to roof.
And it's so much fun.
And I really want it.
All right.
Well, you can't have my copy because now that you've told me it's fun, I need to go back and play it more.
It's a terrible game.
Lies.
Yeah.
Lies.
You played Myst Online a little bit.
What did you think of that?
I think I would like it a whole lot if it didn't have the worst controls I've ever touched.
It's really terrible.
But it's simple.
Simply Hard, maybe if it had like a gamepad input thing I could use, but I can't use WASD and it's just, it goes back to that old Resident Evil style where up is always forward no matter which way you're facing and I don't dig that and the mouse is awkward to use.
But I think I will probably give it another shot because it was really cool because I like solving puzzle things.
Alright.
And Crackdown's a great game.
It's so much fun.
I would say something more, but it's probably like racist.
It is so funny.
Can I say it anyway?
I guess.
It's so much fun kicking the Mexicans in the head.
Orange Lounge Radio has just been banned from Mexico.
Look at that.
How do you like that?
That's the only part I'm at right now.
I'm sure once I beat that part, I can go kick some other race, but Mexicans are so easy targets.
All right, there you go.
Click.
DDR Dollar Bill says, Holy racist remark.
My God.
Actdeft is a Mexican.
Didn't like that comment.
Did not like that comment.
That's okay, because I'm like a quarter Brazilian, and that's all I know.
So I'm dirty, too.

Agent Otto, I don't recognize your name.
What do you want, Agent Otto?
Are you a new listener of Orange On Radio?
I'm from Elevator Action.
Oh!
Oh, God!
Oh, yes, Elevator Action, that horribly overrated game from the 1980s.
How are you, Agent Otto?
I'm doing great.
I don't know what your problem is with my game and what I do for a living.
I go into buildings, find documents, and not get shot in the head and not get crushed by elevators.
What do you do?
You sit there and talk about how bad my game is?
Well, Agent Otto, your game bored the shit out of me because it was pretty much the same joke after the first two minutes for, you know, hours on end.
You know the game's actually hard, right?
Yes, it is pretty hard.
That's another reason why I don't play it.
Oh.
Well, then you probably didn't play anything from the 80s then, because you clearly hate hard games.
No, I actually played a lot of games from the 80s, like Crystal Castles.
Actually, I don't know if you listened to the program last week, but we had a whole segment on 80s games that I played in Beat the Host.
I don't listen to your show.
I'm too busy going through... How did you get the number to this program then, Agent Otto?
Because I'm at DMN's house drinking beer, and I heard you talking shit about me.
Why are you hanging out with DMN?
He sucks.
because I have no one better to hang out with
And you can hear DMN here on Orange Lounge Radio on Thursday nights on STFU.
If you want to hear that.
Uni says DMN is not funny.
Aw, poor DMN.
Poor baby.
Alright.
Sorry to those folks we didn't get to, but we gotta get the show wrapped up because it's already like 20 minutes after 9.
We're running a little long tonight.
We'd like to go home at a decent hour tonight.
So if there's any more last minute stories, now's a good time to get them out.
Nope.
Loki?
Nope.
Let's go around and get everybody's
Final thought.
Loki, your final thought.
I need to finish Crackdown.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
I need to play more Captain America.
My final thought is Pants.
