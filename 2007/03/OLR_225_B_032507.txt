Orange Lounge Radio
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on March 25th, 2007.
We tape Orange Lounge Radio in two parts.
If this is your very first time downloading Orange Lounge Radio to listen to us, please check our RSS feed for past shows.
And you can hear part A of this episode where we talked about the launch of the PlayStation 3.
We talked about the black Xbox 360.
and so on and so on.
When I say launch of the PlayStation 3, I mean in Europe, of course.
Not here.
That would be old news, and we try to avoid old news, if possible, on this program.
DarkSakura is not here tonight, and I was out of town for the past four days, so Loki's taking over the news tonight, and I am simply commenting here with Rice Princess, who's filled in tonight and is making the occasional comment while playing on the laptop.
All right.
Loki, take it away.
Alright, well this week we had some more news that wasn't really favorable for Sony.
And it was more exclusives leaving Sony and going to the Xbox 360.
Not necessarily being exclusive for the 360, but for now for both systems.
So, for example, the first title, and actually a big one, Devil May Cry 4, has been confirmed to be on the Xbox 360 and the PSP...
and that is confirmed according to Capcom Japan so um that sucks and according to Xbox product manager of Microsoft Germany Boris Schneider Schneider John I guess hyphen in the name Devil May Cry is only the first there will be three exclusives total that are coming to the Xbox 360 and um
According to that, I believe it was Final Fantasy XIII and Metal Gear Solid 4, the other two.
Boy, that would be a 1, 2, 3 knockout.
I mean, honestly, Final Fantasy XIII for me is kind of one of the few things that Sony seems to be hanging on with right now because Xbox 360 kind of lacks really solid role-playing, next-gen role-playing games right now.
I mean, sure, you've got Enchanted Arm, but that is...
While it wasn't a bad game, it wasn't a OMG, memorable, wonderful, forever title.
And although Final Fantasy XIII may indeed suck, it is a Final Fantasy game.
There's going to be people lined up for it.
To be fair, though, this was in his blog post, because I guess that's the way he keeps blogs nowadays.
Oh, sorry, chat room says Blue Dragon.
Yeah, true, true, you got me there.
And to be honest, though, these are just...
Kind of a personal shopping list.
It's not necessarily anything confirmed.
This is just a rumor for now.
But Devil May Cry 4 is definitely... That's going to hurt.
And to be honest, though, you kind of have to be stupid unless there's a lot of money on the table to release something just on PlayStation 3.
I mean, especially if you're looking to sell lots of copies of it.
There's just not that many units out there.
For now, but we don't know what Sony might have in the pipeline.
And there's companies that are doing that.
I mean, look at...
Ubisoft, for example.
How long has Rainbow Six Vegas for the PlayStation 3 been delayed?
A long time.
It originally was supposed to be coming out at launch, and then it was delayed to January, then February, then March, now I think April and possibly May.
I mean...
That's, yeah, they're really pushing along until there's enough units out there, and it will keep moving until Christmas if it has to.
Can I be honest for a minute, though?
You know how sometimes folks assume, because we do this podcast in our spare time and everything, that we play every single game that's out there and stuff, but that's not true.
We don't have time to play everything.
I'm going to be honest.
Devil May Cry is one of those series I never have played.
As much as I would like it, it looks fun, it looks interesting, I just have never really sat down and played it.
So to me, this news just kind of made me go, meh, that sucks for Sony.
But, you know, I didn't, that was pretty much all I said.
I wasn't really like, oh my god, you know, this whole thing, because I'm not like super into Devil May Cry, because again, I've just never, it's one of those series I just haven't had a chance to get into.
If they lose Final Fantasy XIII, that's going to be hard.
Now, for me, that's a big deal, because Metal Gear Solid, I am not that into that series as I am Final Fantasy.
If Final Fantasy XIII has lost to the Xbox 360, I have zero reason to get a PlayStation 3.
Honestly.
My thinking, though, in this, and this is just kind of going back to what they did with the Final Fantasy VII series, is that they're going to release a version on PlayStation 3, and they're going to release a different version on the Xbox 360.
Then they're going to have something else on the PSP, and then they're going to have something else on the DS.
You know, the kind of, do these ten title releases for one game type thing, you know, like they did with Final Fantasy VII.
How uber ridiculous that was.
So, I don't know.
And the game could suck.
I don't know.
Okay, I guess I'd give that, although, well, Sony does have, again, the track record, that's kind of what I'm looking at right now, when PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and maybe that's not a fair comparison, but you kind of think that, okay, well, if it was that way before, but I get what you're saying, you know, they didn't have Mistwalker last time, and that's a pretty big something something, I'll give you that.
Give me a break for forgetting Blue Dragon.
I've been out of town the past four days.
I'm going to keep using that as my excuse as much as I can.
James Patrick says, also, Final Fantasy XIII uses the white engine.
Unreal Engine 3 is being used for something they haven't announced.
But I would bet it's a spinoff.
And there is something else.
They are going to be announcing something new during that May Final Fantasy party or whatever.
Interesting.
Jumpman says, maybe Kingdom Hearts 3 for Unreal.
I don't know.
or how about a new series out of Squeenix?
I mean, it wouldn't kill them to come up with a new series, would it?
True.
However, though, fear not, Sony, because not all is lost.
In fact, you may remember, I don't know, a while ago, there was a partnership between Namco Bandai and Sony called Celis or Celius, I guess.
and it's a brand new partnership that they are creating some brand new games including three games that have been announced so far and actually they showed up in Famitsu Magazine Brave Arms which appears to be like a third person action game kind of like Ninja Gaiden there was another game called Chain Limit which is kind of a James Bond or Jack Bauer style spy adventure game and Second Season 1 which is a first person drama sci-fi action title
And I gotta say, from looking at the screenshots of it in Fumitsu Magazine, those look damn good.
So, way to go.
I mean, that's some good stuff right there.
You know, they just need to have some more exclusive titles to them that look really nice.
And, you know, people will be all over that stuff.
I mean, they look really nice.
I can't wait for these games to come out.
Anyways, so kind of moving along here.
Night, Night, Night, Night
In other words, it's coming out, and if you think so at this point that it's not, you're an idiot, or you're the biggest conspiracy theorist in the world.
It is coming out.
Period.
One person, though, that's not really interested in the New Knights game is Yuji Naka.
He's basically saying that at the present, I have no such intentions to create another game in the franchise, so much like Katamari, it will probably live on without him.
Duke Nukem Forever Duke Nukem Forever
and hopefully we'll be out soon.
Other info... Wasn't there some type of promise it was going to be out before the end of the year?
Was it last year?
I don't know.
Ah, fuck it.
I don't even listen to them anymore.
Some other interesting stuff, though.
It's rumored that the composer for Elder Scrolls Oblivion has jumped on board to score Duke Nukem Forever.
And a couple of things hinting to that.
3D Realms developer Raphael Van Lietrop, it looks like, discussed in his blog about a recent visit
from Julian Soul, the guy who did the score.
Also, in Insider's only interview at IGN, Jeremy left one hint about his secretive upcoming project.
He said, when it's done.
So, that was another quote that they had for Duke Nukem.
We should get him on the show, because we had some guy from that site where they sell his music previously on the program, and we were going to try and get an interview with that guy.
Maybe we can try and beat him down for the details.
But he's an excellent composer.
Oblivion had some incredible music.
And as did, you know, Prey, he did the music for that as well And Prey had some pretty awesome songs in it But also Guild Wars has a really great soundtrack If you've ever listened to it And he did that as well So that's pretty exciting if he's doing Duke Nukem Forever But that's a very, I mean, you know, Oblivion and Guild Wars are very, you know, medieval type You know, have a certain sound to them I would see, obviously, Duke Nukem Forever's score sounding a little more like the Prey But, I don't know, it could be interesting Could be interesting He's a talented guy
Well, since we're talking about stuff coming out, might as well start talking about what's coming out this week.
And I'm going to start off here real quick with what's coming out in the UK.
And you had lots of stuff this week, of course, with the PlayStation, well, last week with the PlayStation 3 launch and whatnot.
But now, though, we've got some good stuff coming out for you, including we've got this week Gran Turismo 4 Mobile, although I would believe that when I see it, because I haven't heard anything about that.
I'm not sure if I'll believe that, but
God of War 2 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.
Fear is coming out on PlayStation 3 for you guys.
And I know that game has been delayed forever over here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're doing the Euro dates.
Never mind.
I was like, didn't God of War 2 already come out over here?
Yes, it did.
Just kidding.
300 March of Glory is finally making its way out to the PSP.
After Burner Black Falcon is also coming out.
Bionicle Heroes for the Wii being put out by Eidos as well.
Call of Duty Roads to Victory for the PSP.
Command & Conquer 3 Tiberian Wars for the PC.
And Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 coming out for the Wii.
So that's a pretty cool lineup.
Also, I guess, looks like a Heat Seeker on the Wii and the PSP.
Hopefully that stuff comes out here pretty soon.
And Medal of Honor Vanguard on the Wii and PlayStation 2 will be out this week.
As well as Test Drive Unlimited.
and looks like Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent as well on the PlayStation 3.
For the U.S., we've got some good stuff coming out.
Of course, this week, not a whole lot.
I've got a few movie tie-ins, like, for example, Meet the Robinsons.
Got some games coming out for that.
PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox 360, the Wii, the DS, the Game Boy Advance, and PSP.
So, you know, lots of systems for that game.
And, of course, on...
PlayStation 2 and the Wii, we have Medal of Honor Vanguard, which is going to be coming out.
Metal Slug Anthology is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, hopefully this week, because it's been delayed a lot.
Let's see here.
On the PlayStation 3, we have Splinter Cell Double Agent.
The Shivering Isles
I need to spend the hundred hours to just explore every nook and cranny.
If you happen to be in the mood for some really weird PC titles, I've got a couple titles.
I think these have to be my favorites for the week.
Super Granny 3 on the PC.
Rad, what do you do in Super Granny 3?
I'm not sure, but it looks pretty awesome.
Apparently... Gilf 3.
Super Granny 3 but that's still not my favorite title my favorite title has to be this Alien Disco Safari that one is that has to be my favorite title of the week and that's going to be coming out no idea but maybe we'll see Super Granny 4 meets the Alien Disco Safari Granny's Alien Disco Safari 4 winner Cabela's Alien Disco Safari
All right.
Well, I haven't been good for much this week, but at least maybe I can get out some Japanese release dates.
Would that be okay?
That'd be okay.
Do you have any exclusives, by the way?
I didn't hear any of the good stuff.
You didn't really have too much to announce.
Of course, you know, not a big surprise.
I think this has been announced originally.
They said they were doing Guitar Hero 80s edition or something.
Yeah, that was no surprise.
That's coming out in June.
You landed a date.
But, you know, it was weird.
We got linked from, like, some, like, punk rock music news site linked that.
Like, you know, a lot of folks kind of forgot that they've already said they're doing an 80s edition or they've hinted at it.
So a lot of folks are kind of taking that as, you know, news for the first time.
Yeah, I mean, it's this.
This stuff is nothing new.
I mean, I just thought I'd point it out because everyone's, you know, got a big boner over Guitar Hero.
You know, especially with the new game coming out next week, you know, so that's going to be big.
So, I don't know.
Look forward to more Guitar Hero.
They're definitely keeping up with their promise with releasing multiple releases throughout the week.
They're not the only franchise that's promised to do that, and we'll get into that a little bit later.
Japanese release dates.
Before I get into those, looking at the chat room here,
Let's see.
Meklar says, Super Granny 3, you have to save cats.
That could be a joke.
I don't know.
And then ShadowNextGen says, Shivering Isles is coming out the day Xbox Live is down.
LOL.
And Joshi16 follows up that with, it's only down for 14 hours.
It's official.
But don't those things usually take longer than they say they do?
Yeah, apparently it's not for anything specific.
They said they had a lot of work to do on the back end, so they're kind of doing that right now.
Going back in chat to the Duke Nukem Forever chat, TheRobD from This Day in Gaming says, I like how the creators of DNF, Duke Nukem Forever, actually take responsibility for screwing it up.
They have no excuses, just we screwed up.
DarkSakura made a cameo on This Day in Gaming this week, by the way.
Check that out, it's hilarious.
Japanese release dates.
Xbox 360 gets Absolute Blazing Infinity, Call of Duty 3, and Asia gets the release of Rayman Raving Rabbids all on the 29th of March.
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Mizase Surimaster is coming out from Hudson for the Nintendo Wii.
And this looks to be some type of sports title that's coming out.
It looks like it involves fishing.
Hasn't this been announced for the U.S.
as some other name?
Because it looks like it's all fishing.
is what it is.
Some type of fishing game.
I saw some screenshots for this.
Maybe.
Maybe somebody in chat room would know more information about that whole thing.
Let's see.
Also coming out on the... Well, that's it.
You can get some controller covers and stuff for like $5, $10 on Nintendo Wii.
I don't know if Raven and Raven Rabbids is coming out because that's another game that they kind of delayed.
It was very last minute too.
It was supposed to be coming out this week and then I think it got moved to May.
For the 360.
For the 360.
I don't know.
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Winning Post 7 Maximum 2007 on the 29th of March for the PlayStation 3.
That's a horsey racing game.
Enjoy your horsey racing if you are into that.
Coming out over on the PlayStation 2, Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix.
I know a lot of folks are very excited about that.
Vitamin X. I like the name of this game.
Vitamin X is coming out.
There's also a limited edition available.
I'm not sure if this is based on an anime or what, because I haven't been keeping tabs on my anime, but it's certainly got one of those covers.
Rice Princess, you know a lot about anime.
Is Vitamin X an anime?
I've never heard of it.
I think so.
Vitamin X?
I don't know.
It's got a little cover there.
It's an action game.
It's not ringing a bell for me.
Maybe somebody in chat knows.
Couldn't tell you that one there.
But also, this other one, this sounds like a very interesting game coming out in Japan.
Gouken Utopia, Manabi Straight, Kira Kira Happy Festa is coming out.
and this is an adventure game with a bunch of girly anime characters on the cover.
Looks like a chibi punch and kick game.
But it has a cute name.
Yay.
So have fun with that.
Let's see if anything else is coming out of the other systems.
Oh, Nintendo DS.
Digimon.
Two Digimon games coming out from Bandai.
Moonlight and Sunburst.
It doesn't really say what Vitamin X is, but it says it's a love adventure game by D3.
Oh, a love adventure game, huh?
Does that mean it's like a dating sim?
I don't know.
Maybe.
We'll see.
That's pretty much all I got for you guys over in Japan.
Have fun with your chibi girly fighting game.
Well, the US is going to see something else coming soon to your local video store, I guess.
Blu-ray or a Blu-ray release of the classic video game and arcade classic, Dragon's Lair will be coming out soon and not really a big surprise because it's been out on DVD for a while now and they expect that
It's going to be on HD DVD at some point, and it's going to be sold for $49.95.
Yikes, that's quite expensive.
I don't know how you could really, well, I don't know.
I thought the graphics were probably as good as you can get on Dragon's Lair.
I mean, you can't really re-enhance it anymore.
It seems a little bit pointless to me.
I mean, you know, Dragon's Lair has kind of already been done, you know, on DVD, and that's about as, I mean, the original was on Laserdisc.
and it wasn't that pretty.
I mean, did they clean it up?
Did they do anything to it?
Not that I can see.
Interesting.
Well, there you have it.
Is Dragon's Lair a reason to buy a $600 PlayStation 3?
No.
Yes, says Miklatov.
Miklatov's just fucking with us.
He's just kidding.
Anyways, another... Now, release Super Granny 3 on Blu-ray and we're talking or Ultimate Duck Hunter from the bonus segment tonight or whatever the fuck that game was.
Ultimate Duck Hunting
Jake Gyllenhaal
So speaking of stuff that's been delayed, Calling All Cars.
Brand new game that's supposed to be coming out to the PlayStation Network.
It's going to be one of their downloadable games.
It's been moved to April and this is done by the same guy that did God of War, David Jeff.
Basically, I don't know, he's just hit a roadblock as far as putting it out on the PlayStation Network.
Never really given any reasons why.
They did have some gameplay footage of it and it
And he said, though, I mean, he's not trying to compete with, like, a Halo or anything, or even God of War or this.
I'm still saying it looks like crap.
And he says it's all about the fun factor.
It did not look fun at all.
Oh, God.
It looked pretty boring.
So, hopefully I'm wrong, and it'll come out to be pretty fun.
I don't know.
We'll have to see.
Hopefully they release a demo.
Mm-hmm.
Another game that's getting yet another release, especially next week.
They have SingStar Pop coming out over here.
Well, that's not all.
They're going to be seeing six SingStars come out by next year.
On PlayStation 2 or mixed?
I think both because I know PlayStation 3 is getting SingStar coming out.
But wasn't PlayStation 3 only supposed to get like one SingStar and that's it?
And then they download everything with that?
Well, I think so.
I mean...
But then again, I mean, you never know.
Remember originally Karaoke Revolution was going to have add-ons to it and that never happened?
They figured out, hey, we can... We got like a couple packs here, a couple packs there.
We can sell whole games and make more money.
So, yeah, that's scary and I'm not playing any of them.
Yeah, Actdeft was asking in chat the ultimate question, will Loki buy it?
I will not touch this.
And will we put it on YouTube?
No, I will not touch this game.
Even if I get it free, I will be burning it.
Yeah, it's a horrible, horrible, horrible game.
Karaoke...

Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRater.com if you'd like to send us an email.
I just randomly picked a few emails for this week, so I apologize if I didn't get to you tonight.
You'll just have to deal with that rejection.
Let's start with an email from Meklar, who writes to say, Just a quick email to say, you rock!
And a quick little tidbit I heard from a friend who recently left the employment of Sega.
Nights is coming to the Wii, but also seems to be heading to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, too!
Seems to her, the game now plays like the magic carpet from Sonic and the Secret Rings.
Either way, it's something I've not heard before.
How about you guys and Gal?
Definitely I knew about the Wii through something similar, like a friend of a friend at Sega, but I did not hear of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Very interesting, if true.
It makes sense, though.
It does make sense.
I mean, you know, Knights is one of those franchises I think people have been wanting to see come back for a while.
So, very interesting.
I want new Rez.
Me too, but too bad it's a different company altogether.
Well, thank you for the email.
We have an email from Sakura Max.
Says, Dear OLR, first order of business.
Rob, don't be such a tit.
Stop the accent.
You disgrace my friends.
Somebody's taking issue to my British accent.
I do hear on the program sometimes.
Don't be such a tit about it.
Just teasing.
I guess part of the charm is that my accents are so horrible, I don't know what else to tell you.
Second order of business, Jamie.
The reason I say Rondo of Blood sucks is because it's on PSP, one of the consoles I don't own, and I've lost my loyalty to Sony.
I don't know, though, with some of these big games, it seems like they're trying to woo some people back to PSP.
Is it too little, too late?
Yes.
You think so?
Was there a story this week, and I don't know if it's something upcoming, forgive me, but I want to say I read something on the internet before I left for my trip that said that
Retailers are getting pissed that Sony will not do a price cut on the PSP, and some are threatening to just get the damn thing off their shelves.
Yeah, I was at the PlayStation, or Destination PlayStation show.
Apparently they were demanding that the price be lowered for the system.
I did see, though, what they were, GameStop was doing a special this week.
They had the, was it the, they had like a bundle pack a long time ago.
Remember when the PlayStation Portable first came out where it had like the case and the memory stick and stuff like that?
Well, apparently now they don't have that.
The core system is just PSP, charger, done.
So now they were offering that one at $199 because originally it was $250.
So it's kind of a markdown, but yeah.
Well, I think they're probably going to redesign it or something.
So get people to buy it again.
Bastards.
Alright, well, there you go.
Sorry, DarkSakura was not here tonight to respond to your comment, but if we remember, we'll tell her next week.
Third order of business, I just got DDR Supernova on my arcade.
Congratulations on being about six months late to that party.
Just kidding.
Fourth order of business, DDR Supernova might not be too good, considering the fact that the first one wasn't too successful.
I'm not... Yeah, I'm not sure I understand that statement, because what... What first one are we basing it off of?
Oh, do we mean like DDR Supernova...
DDR Supernova Supernova 2 Arcade
Sakura Max is the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old and signs that email and says, P.S.
Duskcap.
I don't know.
That's what he says in his email.
He says, the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old.
Do your parents know you listen to this?
Shame on you.
That closing statement right there just makes you realize why a 12-year-old shouldn't be on the internet.
Ouch.
Ouch.
Wow, you're so awesome.
N.A.I.F.
Last week you asked us to send you our favorite jokes.
Well, this is my all-time favorite joke.
Because remember last week we had the email?
Oh, yeah.
I completely forgot about it last week.
Well, here we go.
We got a joke back.
Although, we do remember we said voicemail, not email.
That's all right.
Because I don't think we got really any voicemails.
So, I don't know.
I didn't check.
Again, I've been kind of gone.
So, here we go.
I know it's an old one, but every time I tell it to my friends, they really enjoy it, and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.
So Rice, Princess, and Loki and Miklatov will be our judges on how funny this joke is.
It's like American Idol for jokes.
That'd be funny.
Something like that.
Although I kind of feel like we should have some music that plays with this or something.
So maybe we should have some joke-telling music while we read the rest of this email.
I'm going to play some joke-telling music.
You ready?
Okay.
One day, the teacher walks into her classroom and announces to the class that on each Friday, she will ask a question to the class and anyone who answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the following Monday.
On the first Friday, the teacher asks, how many grains of sand are in the beach?
Needless to say, no one could answer.
The following Friday, the teacher asks the class, how many stars are in the sky?
And again, no one could answer.
Frustrated, little Johnny decides that the next Friday, he would somehow answer the question and get a three-day weekend.
So Thursday night, Johnny takes two ping pong balls and paints them black.
The next day, he brings them to school in a paper bag.
At the end of the day, just when the teacher says, here's this week's question, Johnny empties the bag to the floor, sending the ping pong balls rolling to the front of the room.
Because they are young kids who find any disruption of class amusing, the entire class starts laughing.
The teacher says, okay, who's the comedian with the black balls?
Immediately, little Johnny stands up and says, Bill Cosby, see you on Tuesday.
That's pretty funny.
I got one laugh in the room, a little chuckle from Loki.
I have bacon.
Are you laughing at the bacon or are you laughing at the joke?
Joke.
All right.
Let's go around and judge that scale on 1 to 10.
It'll be like the gong show here.
Are we going to gong the joke?
Rice Princess, on a scale of 1 to 10, how was the joke?
W. W?
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
Loki on a scale of 1 to 10, how was that joke?
It would be like a 7.
It's definitely an intelligent joke.
I haven't heard it before, so props for that.
All right.
It was good.
All right, and Mikozov?
1.
All right, why such a low score?
Because talking about Bill Cosby's balls is never a good thing, and it's not funny.
It's gross.
There you go.
All right.
Do you think this is going to encourage people to send us more jokes?
I have no idea.
10 for the bacon.
Gods and Heroes Rome Rising
A brief description of our game is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game set to Roman mythology.
Excuse me, I have the hiccups during this poor email.
Some key features is being able to play your hero character however you like with six different classes and an extensive character customization.
You also get to control up to eight minions at a time as well as have a visceral experience.
I like D&L's use of vis, where is there?
Visceral.
Visceral.
What's visceral?
I don't know, I'm probably pronouncing it wrong.
What do you mean, visceral?
Visceral, yeah, sure, visceral experience.
Visceral.
Ten!
I hate you all.
Man, that was the best joke ever.
DarkSakura, never leave me again.
With paired combat animation.
If interested, please sign up in our very active forums at community.godsandheroes.com Love and pointy things DNL.
So I like how DNL is using our mailbag to spam her game, but we'll give her that right here.
In fact...
In fact, why doesn't D&L get us an interview with peoples from the game?
We'll take them.
Now, if I can do anything and I can control up to eight minions, can I, like, sit back and, like, drink ale and have my minions, like, kill things while I just sit there and not do anything?
Do I get level, you know, experience points for that?
I guess.
I don't know.
Folks, let's see.
Blackboy in chat says, wait, Sky's reading an ad that was thinly disguised as an email.
Yeah, I guess.
But it was from a friend of ours, so I'm okay with it.
It's a game I hadn't heard about before, so there you have it.
We'll check it out and give an honest opinion either way.
So, there you have it.
That's it for the mailbag.
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you'd like to send us emails.
Well, earlier we were talking a little bit, we mentioned that the Shivering Isles was coming out for the Xbox, well, for Oblivion on PC and Xbox 360, but it was going to be downloadable on the 360.
Conveniently enough, there is some other stuff you can download off of Microsoft's Marketplace
Well, no, you cannot download porn, as Mikulatov would say.
That's not available yet.
However, they do need a porno channel on the IPTV thing.
That would sell systems.
Anyways, Jetpack, or the new Jetpack game is coming out.
If you might remember Rare's kind of little logo there.
But anyways, yeah, Jetpack Refueled will be hitting the marketplace on Wednesday.
And it will feature...
Obscenely Colorful Graphics, whatever that's supposed to mean.
It's obscene.
128 levels, multiplayer capabilities.
Multiplayer capabilities.
See, this is porn.
The original arcade version and continued exclusion of the letter K from the
And money shots, says Miklatov.
It will be available on the marketplace and will cost you 400 Microsoft points or $5 in real money.
Miklatov, you're giving this the thumbs down.
Is this one of those other games you've probably played that you're not supposed to talk about?
Does it suck?
Can you talk about it?
Why does it suck?
Because it's not fun to play.
What the hell do you do?
You shoot things and then you fly away and it's really boring and it's not Boom Boom Rocket, so why are we talking about it?
Well, the people want to know.
Well, they don't anymore.
Thank you very much, I suppose.
Anyways, this week, and Jamie will love this, but
On the Xbox Live Marketplace, they had brand new heroes and villains that you could download to expand Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
And it featured eight new playable characters, including the Incredible Hulk, Magneto, Hawkeye, Sabretooth, Doctor Doom, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Venom.
And basically, you've got brand new signature power skins,
Dialogue, Conversations, and Achievement Points.
Isn't Cyclops one-eyed?
No.
Total porn on Xbox Live Marketplace.
Now they want you to download one-eyed monsters on Xbox Live.
Does he blast stuff out of his one eye?
Total porn.
He doesn't have one eye.
Doesn't Cyclops mean one eye?
One-eyed monster that shoots things.
Like a penis.
Basically, they have it divided up into two different packs.
Now, there's no need to go there, Rice Princess.
That's just dirty.
It's disgusting.
They have a hero and villain pack, each of which were 500 points, or $6.25.
Otherwise, you can also buy the combo pack, which features both, and save a little bit of money.
It's 800 Microsoft points, or $10.
So, saving a good $2.50 there.
and also they have heroes and villains gamer picks that you can download and those are each 80 Microsoft points or $1.
And chatroom, yes, I was kidding.
Of course I know who Cyclops is.
I did see the X-Men movies.
I watched the cartoon when I was a kid.
Please.
James Marsters.
Anyways, now let's talk about a game.
Why are you laughing at me?
Because you're funny.
and Visceral.
Go to hell.
Now let's talk about a game that came out a couple weeks ago.
Ghost Recon 2 Advanced Warfare 2.
Apparently, Mexico doesn't like the game too much.
I guess it has something to do with the Mexican terrorists in the game.
Fuck Mexico!
Sorry, Actdeft.
Sorry.
I think what's most interesting about this story though, because apparently the game has been blacklisted, and I want to say Chihuahua, Mexico?
Is there such a thing as a Chihuahua, Mexico?
Yes, but it has nothing to do with the dog.
I mean, there's a weed California, Loki.
Towns get names weird things all the time.
But weed makes sense, though, because weeds are just out there, and that just happens to be slang.
Chihuahua's not slang.
It's a dog.
Or Chihuahua's like, you know, they're an animal that runs around in parks like we have squirrels.
And Mexico hates it because they don't bathe.
Anyway... Wow.
The views and opinions expressed.
Actdeft says, and it's a state, like, you know, how... Well, it's not really a state, but, you know... Anyways, so Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior Fighter 2 has been blacklisted in Chihuahua, Mexico, and...
Besides the fact that the city's got a weird name, there has been apparently orders, Mexico has apparently ordered the confiscation of any and all copies of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 that surface in the state.
This is a site report from El Dario.
El Dario.
Is that also a town named after the water?
It's not El Dario, it's
I think it's El Diero.
Anyways.
A Mexican broadsheet which says that the action was taken after Mayor Hector I'm not even going to start pronouncing these names.
I would fucking buy Ghost Recon if they had El Diario as like a terrorist in it.
They've slammed the game as being a crime against the intellectual capacity of the Juarez residents.
Um
and apparently they've decided to take action.
So, in any case, GamePolitics also notes that a statement they took from the mayor who said that violent video games instill values which are upside down.
These actions are despicable because they attempt to divide the good and wool, a goodwill of the residents of America and Mexican cities.
So, you won't be able to get your fix on Ghost Recon Advanced Warfare 2.
However, God of War 2, I'm sure, is still selling like hotcakes.
So,
Actdeft
However though, if you want to get in on some of that Ghost Recon Advanced Warfare 2 action, it will be available on the PC.
They're doing the beta test, which is starting in April.
So definitely go and sign up on the website, which is ghostrecon.uk.ubi.com.
I guess this would be the UK beta test, now that I've noticed that.
Anyways, so on to a different game.
If you may not be able to play Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 and you live in Mexico, maybe you want to participate in the beta for Quake Wars.
Because id Software is looking for some good first-person shooter clans to get in on this beta test.
And basically what you'll need to do is have your clans register for this.
And basically you can participate by sending your application to etqw...
BetaTest at Activision.com and with following your clan name, number of active members, games played regularly and played competitively, your website and details like that.
100 OLR achievement points to the first person to make the El Diario clan.
But Quake Wars looks awesome.
Can't wait to play it when it comes out on the 360 PlayStation 3 and PC.
Sigh.
Anyways, kind of off to a little bit of a different tangent here.
Another first person game that's definitely popular out there right now is Gears of War.
And New Line apparently found time to register the rights for the movie, or secure the rights for the movie, so that they can make yet another horrible video game movie.
Awesome.
Anyways, Variety was reporting that New Line Cinema has snagged rights to Gears of War and that Stuart Beatty will be writing the script with Marty Bowen and Wick Godfrey.
It'll suck.
Yeah, I can't say that I recognize any of those people.
How can it be good?
I'm sorry.
It'll suck like all the other games.
So the rights went up for auction with a 21-page treatment by Beatty.
Best known for his script work on Collateral and Derailed.
God awful.
I wanted to gouge out my eyes and stuff afterwards.
Did it make you want to kill yourself like Ultimate Duck Hunt?
Yeah.
I was like, oh man.
It could be pretty good.
They could flesh out the somewhat existent story and actually make something that's entertaining and kind of interesting, which video game movies usually lack.
At least good entertaining, not like ha-ha entertaining.
Because that idea worked so well with Resident Evil and Doom.
Resident Evil is decent.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Capcom, why you got against Torch Lounge Radio?
Afraid we're going to say something we shouldn't.
What the hell was that?
My pouty voice.
Oh my.
No love from Capcom.
No love from Capcom.
Maybe I was a little hard on Dead Rising, but anyways.
Their Capcom day is going to be April 12th.
One game has been announced already.
and that would be the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii and that's one thing that they're hoping that will be featured there as well as some info on Resident Evil 5 for the PlayStation 3 and 360.
Another thing though is they're going to be announcing a brand new game and so we don't know what exactly that is.
Just a brand new game.
Beautiful Joe again or maybe Mega Man.
That would be nice.
Miklatov is adamant about a Phoenix Wright 3.
I hope not.
That's only the best game they've ever had in, like, ten years.
Ever.
Ever in ten years.
What about a new Mega Man game?
Wouldn't that be kind of cool?
Well, there's... Well, how about taking Mega Man back to its roots?
Taking it back.
Taking it back.
Back to its roots.
That would be great if they did that.
Because I don't know what's up with all the... Mega Man Z. Battle Network, whatever crap.
They already did Mega Man Z, and it sucked.
Mega Man 9.
Crap.
Was it Mega Man 9?
I'd go for that.
Mega Man ZX.
Horrible.
How about just Mega Man?
You know, I think folks will forgive you if you just want to start over.
How about just redo Mega Man Legends?
Legends was pretty fun.
Legends 3.
Seriously, bring Tron Bon back.
Alright, I'm done.
Alright, anyways.
Finally, this kind of goes... Gotta bring it full circle.
Back to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Move over, King Kong!
There's a new leader of ultimate easy achievement points, and that is TMNT, the game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
TeamXbox GameSpot
Even still, the better graphics and achievements ultimately make the 360 version the best by default.
Hmm.
Interesting.
I might check it out.
It seems like something that would be like a rental, but I don't know if I'd buy that.
Especially just for a thousand achievement points.
I don't care, you know.
The Tetris game I bought today seems to have, you know, okay achievement points.
Like, it's doable if you are any good at Tetris.
I'm telling you.
We'll see.
Earth Defense Force 2017.
It's the dumbest game on the face of the earth, but so fun to play.
But do you have easy... Not easy achieving points at all.
Although, actually, no, probably beating a game on easy and normal would be relatively easy.
Although normal is pretty hard.
But that's what's kind of...
Skypline is open by the way, username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR
And plus you unlock different weapons that might help out with playing through the levels at harder difficulty or something like that.
So there's a lot of strategy involved there.
Plus it's just so cheesy and stupid that you gotta play it.
I mean, because your other guys will yell weird shit like, Oh no!
Tiny died!
Oh no!
Big stuff died!
I don't know.
I just want to keep playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night right now, to be honest.
All over again, like it was the first time.
Heck yeah.
We got a call on the old Skype line.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
This is DMN.
Hello, DMN.
Long time no talk.
This is CNN.
No, it's not.
Don't get us sued.
This is OLR.
What's on your mind, DMN?
Well, I came across your website a couple days ago, and I noticed the Katamari story got removed.
Interesting.
You should bring that up.
Well, what do you want to say about it?
Um...
Fuck Gamespot and everything it stands for regarding that.
Didn't they pull the story up only a few days after and not even cite Orange Lounge Radio for it?
I can't comment on this at this time.
Next week we'll have an official statement on what's going on, but we can't comment on what's going on at this time.
Wow.
So that's it.
Okay.
Anything else you want to ask us about?
Thanks for bringing that up.
That's alright.
What'd you say, Mikotov?
I was going to ask him about how much he hates the stupid people in WoW, because he was complaining about it earlier.
Oh yeah, you're in our WoW guild.
What's going on in WoW?
I'm just getting sick of all the stupid people who think that internet shorthand is okay in that fucking game.
Like, it's acceptable to a degree.
Like LOL and stuff like that?
Okay.
For example...
Don't use the letter U to represent you.
It's two extra fucking letters you can type.
Y-O-U.
Jesus Christ.
Isn't there some type of add-on that you can get for World of Warcraft that will allow you to automatically, like, I remember Drew Nami was telling me about this once when he was here.
It was something about, like, I don't know, some filter that would automatically, like, change the letter U into Y-O-U, and it would change, like, a lot of the noob speak for you.
God, I need to find that.
Drew Nami's in chat.
He says it's called Eloquence.
is what it's called.
I'll have to pick that up because I don't mind typing out full words and full sentences, but I guess I'm the only person.
That's why you should just stay with your guild because we all type normally.
I love my guild.
My guild's awesome.
We are awesome.
And go vote for the songs for the STFU song tournament.
We're at the Sweet 16.
The big matchup right now is Colors vs. So Deep.
So Deep.
Go So Deep.
You guys should vote and
Ready, set, Rob's going to hang up on me.
No, I'm not.
But thank you very much for striking the nerve and allowing me to tease next week.
No problem.
Have a good weekend.
All right, you too.
All right, bye.
Bye.
Bye, DMN.
If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number.
Or you can call us, username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
I swear we didn't pay him to call in and ask about that.
Funny you should mention that.
Loki and I were just talking about that before the show.
Let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's Legend of Zaku.
Hi, Legend of Zaku.
What's on your mind?
Nah, just chilling, nothing much, but I'm off the heels of a shitty tournament that I went to yesterday that I'm getting filmed for a DDR documentary.
You went to a DDR tournament yesterday that was shitty.
What tournament was this?
This was one hour long island, far from where I live, but me and three other players from the city just went out there.
Don't they have pretty good transit, though?
Because you can take transit out.
Of course, we took the railroad.
There you go.
You guys have much better out there when it comes to transit than we do.
It's kind of better out here.
I mean, the place we went to was really accessible.
The only good thing about it was the documentary that two NYU students were filming on DDR players.
What's the documentary?
I have to be honest, though.
A DDR documentary does not strike me as anything new.
What makes this one special?
Yesterday, this NYU film student was just filming the four of us through the tournament.
and just do our normal routines, just doing all the stupid things that we do.
And in addition, we were actually interviewed.
We were asked questions about the basic stuff about how long we've been playing DDR, what got into it.
And then we have other questions such as, how do you see yourself in the scene years from now?
That sort of thing.
It's kind of like a future perspective.
I was once interviewed for one of these documentaries and I believe it was right when we'd started Orange Lounge.
It was about a year after we started, but I don't think these people knew about the radio stations.
But I used to do freestyling under a pseudonym, Dr. Dick, and I just would get up on the machine and do an improv and just fuck off and I'd wear a funny hat.
and they wanted to interview me for this documentary and they wanted me to wear the funny hat and I said no.
Because I knew they would edit me to look like an idiot and I didn't want that.
Alright, so the documentary right now is still ongoing.
She plans on filming more tournaments in the next few weeks, especially some major ones, you know, some in the group 2 tournaments with R21.
Yeah, so there's only the tip of the iceberg right now, so she has plenty of time to work on it.
So it's going to be a little bit more in-depth than just a one-time thing.
All right.
Well, I'm sorry to hear the tournament was not all that fun.
What do you think a future tournament organizer should consider in planning a DDR tournament?
Fix the pads.
Needs better pads, period.
That's the only thing that just killed it right there is just pads.
All right.
Well, thank you, Zaku.
We appreciate the call.
All right.
Later.
Later.
Bye.
Bye.
All right.
Going to chat room and looking at comments while we wait for more phone calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
DDR Dollar Bill says, Dr. Dick, that was you?
Yeah, I didn't think there was anything on YouTube.
It was some freestyle video floating around for a little while.
I was just dancing like an idiot.
It was nothing serious.
It was just silly.
Let's see.
Blackboy, I guess I'm going to say this.
Blackboy in chat says, so wait, IGN or GameSpot ripped off OLR's news and didn't credit them.
No, that's not what's going on.
Again, we can't say too much yet because we're kind of...
Waiting to make an official thing, but we're not claiming that at all.
But what we will say is that it is interesting that other sites are reporting the exact same thing that we did, and other sites are continuing to run that information.
And I suppose that's all we can say at this time.
Correct?
Correct.
All right.
Then let's go to another call, that being said.
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, what's up, guys?
It's Toshin.
Hi, Toshin.
What's on your mind?
I don't want to bring this all to a WoW tangent, but I gotta ask something, okay?
Sure.
Okay, in the last couple weeks, you've said you've been playing WoW a lot, right?
Yep.
How long have you been playing WoW?
Like, how many hours a week do I put in the game, or how long, like, have I been... Overall.
Overall?
This recent round, I just started playing right when Burning Crusade came out about a week after, so January of this year.
But I've played on and off since...
Oh hell, I don't even remember when I made the first character.
Probably about a year ago, I want to say.
Is it a hard game to get into?
Like, I must be the only one that I know, speaking for myself, that has never played a multiplayer RPG or anything like that.
Mikotov wants to chime in.
Have you started playing it yet, or are you just thinking about it?
Well, my friends, and I know a lot of people, including Rob, who have
I've played it a lot, somewhat, and I mean, I find it interesting and stuff, but I've just never come to, like, bring myself to invest the time in it.
And I was just, is it like a hard thing to get into, or?
It really depends on, like, what class you play, what, um...
Blizzard has it set up really easy for you to take your first hit.
DarkSakura.com
If you've never played an MMO before, it might be a little weird at first.
Yeah, I'd be a total noob.
So you're a total noob.
Well, that's cool, because you've called into this show enough before, and you've been in chat long enough, so that I know you're not a dumbass, and you speak intelligently when you type and everything.
You don't use the letter U for you and all that.
So I don't think you're going to really have a problem fitting in, so to speak, into WoW.
But have you ever played Diablo or a game like it?
I've fiddled with it.
My friend's like, here, take my map and run over to this spot on the map.
I'm like, what do I do if I run into something?
Click the mouse button or something like that.
Part of getting into WoW, don't be afraid to die.
Everybody dies the first couple times they play.
The game is not set up so that your character will get deleted forever if you die a few times.
Dying is kind of cool because it changes the way the game looks until you get to your body.
Die a lot.
I honestly found WoW a lot easier to get into than Final Fantasy XI.
I'm not trying to knock Final Fantasy XI.
I played it for a long time and I have some good memories from that game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I have a question for you guys.
Did you guys ever read the manual?
No, no.
That's like a really thick book that I definitely did not use.
But I never read manuals to games.
Yeah, nor do I. Actually, I'll take that back.
I cracked open Final Fantasy XI's manual because I got so frustrated that I didn't know how to do something.
I finally had to look it up how to do it.
I think I did too, but that was during the 13-hour install of the game.
I was just like, I need something to do.
Yeah, see, I think if you're brand new to MMOs, it wouldn't hurt to...
Toshin, I guess I end with this.
What do you got to lose?
Your life, actually.
Your real life.
You can at least get the free trial to start it off, you know?
Join Ravencrest and we'll help you out.
Yeah, Ravencrest Horde side and you can play with us and we're cool.
How long's the trial?
Ten days.
Ten days?
Enough for you to take your first hit and decide if it's something you want to continue and then you can go from there.
I know it's what, $12.95, $14.95 a month?
$14.95, but you get a limited character.
Well, how much Canadian?
Tosh is in Canada, so...
I don't know.
Who cares?
A little more.
There you go.
Who cares?
Who cares, eh?
Who cares, eh?
All right.
All right.
Well, Toshin, we hope to see you online, but if not, you know.
I'm in the chat room.
You know where to find me.
All right.
We do.
Any other thoughts or comments tonight?
Not really.
I'd like to just say, Travis, thanks for letting me win the game yesterday.
There you have it.
Travis Donovan live on Saturday nights.
If you want to know what the hell Toshin's talking about, you've got to download Saturday's archive, correct?
Correct.
That's correct.
There you go.
You were in chat saying WoW can be played casually.
I didn't see you doing that.
Somebody asked what's an MMO that can be played casually, and WoW has that rest bar feature that makes it very easy.
That's what I liked about WoW is that it has the rest bar so that the addicts get a little bit of a handicap, shall we say, amongst the folks who only can log in occasionally.
And that's what's kept me afloat sometimes in that game because I just went four days without signing in.
I probably have so much rest bar.
It's crazy.
It also just depends on the MMO you pick if you really feel like you need to dedicate a lot of time to it.
I played Final Fantasy XI casually, and that's not a casual game whatsoever.
One more call then, shall we?
Let's do another call.
Yes!
Well, hi!
Yes!
Damn it!
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
One more thing, Raven's Dolphin.
I like how you've incorporated that into your name.
What's on your mind, one more thing, Raven's Dolphin?
The Sony PlayStation launch in Europe.
That's been on my mind for a while.
How so?
Why has that been on your mind?
We got shot!
We got shot?
We as a collective people got shot.
Did you get shot looking for your PlayStation 3?
Oh no, I stood in my bunker.
I was in my room.
There you go.
So you're saying you're surprised because we were all getting shot over it?
What's that?
Sony gave out TVs for the Europeans and I thought that was nice.
But they didn't do it for us.
Don't you think Sony kind of owed Europe something, though?
Like, sorry you had to wait six months.
Oh, most definitely.
So, you know, what's interesting is that the first hundred folks got a TV, but the second hundred folks got flak jackets in case they got shot.
So, Sony is very nice over there in Europe.
That's a one also on the jokes.
That's what I get for improvising here on the program.
What else is on your mind concerning this whole PlayStation 3 stuff, Raven's Dolphin?
Two more things, Skye.
Sure.
How is that bad ability testing going at the Sony Corporation?
I still stick to what I said.
Loki gave that joke a one.
I still stick to what I said when that whole joke came up in the first place on All Games Interactive.
If you're buying a PlayStation 3 to play PlayStation 2 games, you are buying a PlayStation 3 for the wrong reasons.
Okay.
I got a joke for you.
Goodie, I can't wait for this.
Alright, what is that?
Alright, a man walked into a doctor's office wearing saran wrap.
What?
What did the doctor say?
Let him finish!
Sorry, Raven Stolvin, what?
A man walked into a doctor's office and he's dressed in saran wrap.
What did the doctor say?
Um, why the fuck are you sitting in my office dressed in fucking saran wrap, you fucking freak?
No, I see you're nuts.
One.
I'd be a little nicer.
I'd give it a three, Raven Stolfen.
A for effort.
What's with the balls jokes?
First it was Bill Cosby, and now it's just some random guy.
They got the memo.
You like balls.
All right.
Okay.
All right, Raven Stolfen, thanks for the call.
Visit checkinggames.com.
All right, bye.
Good times.
It's great.
I think that's a good way to end the calls for tonight.
What do you think?
I see you're nuts, Rice Princess!
You're fucking nuts!
Is that it for the show?
Are there any other last-minute stories you came across, Loki?
I have one.
It's big.
I have a big last-minute story for you guys.
A little birdie has told me, and this is a rumor, but a little birdie told me that Paper Mario may be on its way to Virtual Console sooner than you think.
Super Paper Mario's release may coincide with that.
So stop booing Paper Mario, Miklatov.
It's a fine game.
So there you have it.
Don't count that game out just yet.
Wasn't that a GameCube title or is that a 64 title?
It was originally Nintendo 64, but I believe there was a paper... Yeah, there was the Thousand Year Door or whatever was on GameCube.
But the original was Nintendo 64.
Oh, cool.
Oh, I just got a good news story right here.
Hmm, what's that?
in actual news though here's another rumor for you don't laugh it encourages her and this is going to be even more confusing but apparently according to was it the NGC magazine in the UK an article in there said there's no screenshots of it yet but the UK version of Pokemon Battle Revolution will not have the restrictions of the friend code system
Really?
So that's confusing.
So, in other words, Europe might not have to, because they don't have child molesters in Europe, I guess, they're not going to have to worry about friend codes, maybe.
You hear that?
Or maybe they're just, I don't know, a little laid back.
Somebody needs to look Reggie Fils-Aimé in the eye and go, friend codes, yes or no, I want a clear answer, don't BS me.
What they should do is say, I will arm wrestle you, Reggie, and the winner decides the friend codes thing.
That's how it should be done.
But Reggie would win.
Every time.
You've got to get someone stronger.
We need to get Chuck Norris.
That's what we need to do.
Anyways.
What else?
Let's see here.
Three Speech, which I remember... A chatter sent me a story I need to read, but go ahead and do yours first.
Three Speech is saying that there's more download content on the way.
And I think, if I remember correctly, that's the semi-official Sony blog...
Anyways, Genji, Days of Blade, says more excitement will be coming, including new armor, I guess.
Oh, and yeah, new armor for your four playable characters.
Don't care, don't care.
Ridge Racer 7, supposed to be getting some more decal packs.
Ooh, so I guess that's neat.
and MotorStorm.
It says any PS3 player playing MotorStorm Online will receive time trial mode automatically.
That actually, I think, was launched this week, so I know that's going into effect.
There's supposed to be some new friend codes, or not friend code system, like a friends list system for that as well.
And Resistance Fallen Man, two new playable maps, Western Moreland and Kambor.
Those are coming soon as well.
I think those are coming in April.
One of our users, Meklar, wanted me to share this with you.
He sent me this in chat.
It's a story from Kotaku.
Somebody named John, I guess who's a reader of the site, just got home from the launch at the Virgin Megastore in London.
Apparently, they were all given some chairs.
There were some friendly folks on hand giving out some camping chairs.
And on the back of the chairs, it said, shouldn't have kept you waiting.
