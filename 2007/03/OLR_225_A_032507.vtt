00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and the Lowkey Arcade

00:14.000 --> 00:25.000

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that video game podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
You know, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, and all that fun stuff

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky if you check our forums or whatever

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
That's S-K-I-E, Sky

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Joining us, as always, say hello to Tech Master Loki

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Hello

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
How you doing Tech Master Loki?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm doing okay

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Alright, you might wonder where Dark Sakura is at tonight, unfortunately she's not joining us tonight

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
She's very sick, she sends her love to all of you guys, but she has a sinus infection

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I spoke to her on the phone briefly before we started tonight

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
And she apparently slept for 14 hours yesterday, which is, you know, a pretty surefire sinus

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Someone's pretty sick, so, sorry Dark Sakura, rest up, feel better

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
And I was all excited too because I saw a Doctor Who pinball machine this weekend, which I'll get into in a little bit

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
No, but seriously, I was like, oh my gosh, this is like, this is Jamie times two

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
These are like two of her loves rolled up into one

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Sort of like what I thought of, like Loki, I've had this thought about you before

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
The first time I ever went to that restaurant in the Bay Area that serves the slabs of meat

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
And they served the chicken wrapped in bacon

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
That made me think of you, because I was like, it's two of Loki's love

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I might add, the chicken wrapped in bacon wasn't that great when I had it, so

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Sorry to hear that

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Alright, well we do have a female perspective on tonight's program

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
You know, not that we really need one, but we have one anyway

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Just teasing, to all the ladies out there listening

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Say hello to Rice Princess

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Hello everyone

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
How are you doing Miss Rice Princess?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm doing well, how about you Rob?

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Oh, pretty good, it's been an interesting week

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, I agree

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I agree

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
So you were talking about movies before we came in tonight, what did you see this week?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Now how was it, because I read a review in some magazine that said it was absolute crap

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Well that magazine's absolute crap, because it was so fucking awesome

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Like it was fucking epic, it was great

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Was it better than the old school ones from like the 90s with the ninja wrap?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
There are two different things, that's apples and oranges

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I just, I loved it, and I loved the old movies too

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Chime in Matt

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I did see it yesterday as well, and I, because I was a little scared

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Because when I first saw the first trailer that came out, it looked badass

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
It was like, oh yeah

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Then I saw these new trailers that they're showing on TV and stuff

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
And they kind of made it look stupid

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
But I swear, go see it, it's fucking awesome

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
And the reason why, they did make, it does tie in with the other three movies

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
And they do make some changes to the storyline

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
You know, it basically takes place after everything

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
And so, you know, April O'Neil's not a reporter anymore

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
And Casey Jones isn't exactly like he was in the other movies

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
But that's fine, you kind of forgive that when you see it

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
It's just, it never lets you down

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
It was one of those movies that I was watching it, and I was just like, fuck, this is awesome

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
You know, it wasn't, really I haven't had that much of a satisfying movie experience in a while

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And this was one of those movies that just, it was awesome

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
It brought me back to what made Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles so cool in the first place

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
It just, it was very satisfying

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And I really suggest, just ignore the negative reviews out there for it

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Because it really is good, and I cannot wait for the sequel

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Are you on somebody's payola, like New Line's payola?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I'm not, I'm not on anybody's payroll for this kind of stuff

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
It was awesome, and yeah, I would love to see it again

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
It really, there's a lot of parts that even have, you know

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I was telling Irene about one scene towards the end of the movie or something

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Which has to do with my Cage Man song, by the way

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
That, it's just, when that scene kicked in, it was like, fuck yeah, that's awesome

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
So, highly, highly recommend this movie, especially if you're a fan of

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
You know, the original Ninja Turtles movie, maybe not so much number two and definitely not three

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
But, you know, even the old series and stuff, it really works

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
And it sounds like that this is going to be something that kind of jump starts the whole movie series all over again

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I'm looking in our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
Because, you know, part of what makes this show so unique, shall we say

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Is that we always encourage the live interaction with our chat room

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
And the phone calls, which we'll take later, chat.orangelaundry.com if you want to join in

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
If you're listening live on this Sunday night

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Let's see, we have Blaze from the O.L. Army says TMNT was fucking amazing

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Joshi16 says one of the turtles is gay, is there a gay turtle now?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
There's not a gay turtle in there, not at all

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Let's see, Wonder Dog Harold says are they really still teenagers at this point?

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay, well maybe not, yeah, because they're pretty old by now, but I was kind of thinking, well maybe teenage for, like, turtles

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I don't know how long turtles live, but, you know

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, I've never done that

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Maybe it's like dog ears or something like that, you know, I don't know

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, I mean, not to, I don't think this is spoiling anything, but they've all, like, kind of, I guess, taken on, like, responsibilities

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Or have, like, moved on past, like, how they used to live before

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
So I guess it's kind of showing that they've, like, grown up a little bit, but

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I don't know, they still, I guess their mentality is still kind of, like, a teenage mentality

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
There was a lot of adult humor in it, which is great, like, a lot of funny stuff

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
It was just awesome, I mean, I mean, if anyone that's going to see it obviously doesn't have to do a shredder anymore

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
This is kind of after all that, they've defeated them, the Foot Clan's kind of been disbanded a little bit

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Where at least they've gone underground, and then it's kind of what they've done since then

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
They kind of went on with their lives, because now they don't have to really protect, you know, New York from anything

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
They're just kind of living, and so now they have to kind of come together

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
And, you know, it's just, it was really awesome

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Even the opening scene where they're showing kind of that flashback with the battle and stuff

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
That was awesome

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
That was great, oh my gosh

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Right now I was like, oh my god, this movie's going to be cool

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Because it was just, it never let you down at all

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
There was a little bit of humor, you know, from the show

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Because, I mean, they were kind of, you know, Michelangelo, of course, is still goofy and stuff

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
But it wasn't, like, detracting, and it was, it fit, it fit with the characters

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
And I'm just really glad they kind of respected the actual characters

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
And didn't make it so retarded and all one-liners

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
I mean, there were one-liners in there, but it worked

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah, it did, like, a lot of them were puns, but I absolutely love puns

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I think puns are, like, the greatest jokes ever

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
And, like, it really worked, I mean, if you were a fan of the old cartoon series

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Or if you watched the movies, I mean, you saw that anyway in the movies or the series

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
So it's, like, it was just more of that, you know, and it was appropriate to the times, too

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
The only thing that really kind of annoyed me was Splinter's voice

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
I know, I know, like, I'm all, did, like, some Chinese dude, like, do his voice or something?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
No, he sounded Jewish

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Really? You think so? I'm like, wow, Splinter

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Oh my god, Turtles

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I know, seriously, it was kind of weird, but

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Well, alright, we can talk movies all night

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Did any of you guys play the games yet? The Ninja Turtles games?

07:13.000 --> 07:13.000
No, no

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
I played the old one on Ninja Turtles

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
That, unlike the movie, did kind of suck

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Alright, well, let's get into a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Where we talk about the video games that we've been playing this week here on the program

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Rice Princess, what have you been playing?

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
Um, I have actually not played anything this week

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
I, like I said before, I cancelled my WoW account for the time being

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Ouch

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
So I kind of have been not doing, I've been, like, doing stuff around the house

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Did you watch anyone play something that looked cool and that you wanted to have?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Oh, no, you know what I played? I played DDR

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Did you? Alright, there you go

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
In the arcade, yes, for the first time in, like, two years, it was awesome

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
What was it, Supernova, Extreme?

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Um, I played, um, Supernova and I played a little bit of, um, whatever's that golfing?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
The other one, Extreme, I think it was

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
Max 2, I think

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I played that, yeah, it was good times

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Memories?

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah, like, I was surprised because I could actually do, like, 7 and 8 footers again

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Whereas I couldn't do that, like, two years ago

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
And I was like, sweet, I don't suck anymore

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
So, yeah, it was good times

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Cool, Loki!

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I finally, I've been waiting for this game for a while

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
And it's just a really weird game to wait for

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
But Earth Defense Force 2017, it is awesome

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
It is so stupid and so ridiculous and the voice acting is so horrible

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
But it's so fun to play

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
It's just, basically, at least

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I know nothing about this game, what is this?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
It is basically these aliens come and start attacking Earth

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
And it is so B-movie, cheesy and stuff

08:45.000 --> 08:45.000
I mean, for example

08:46.000 --> 08:46.000
Like, Destroy All Humans?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Not exactly, like, we're talking, like, robots and giant ants

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I mean, that's giant ants

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
That's what you're fighting for the first few levels is giant ants

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
And it works

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Well, in Final Fantasy, you fight giant slimes to level up

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Okay, but still, though, I mean, it's giant ants

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And the voice acting is so horrible

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Like, for example, they're all, look, it's flying

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Or, look at those alien spaceships

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
It's like something out of the science fiction movie

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Not a science fiction movie, the science fiction movie

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Like, the one and only that's ever been made

09:20.000 --> 09:20.000
Exactly

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
And so, I don't know, it's just, I can't stop playing

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
Basically, you have, you can collect up to 200 weapons in this game

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
By replaying the levels over and over, you can level up your characters

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Or whatever, get your stamina higher

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And you can actually, you can play it through five different difficulty levels

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
I've been playing it through, like, normal and easy

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
And even normal is starting to get hard now

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Playing it on hard, which is not even all the way up to, like,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
They have, like, extreme inferno or something

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Hard is fucking impossible

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
So, inferno's gotta be, oh my god

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Oh my god

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
But, it's pretty fun though

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
It's two player co-op, which is kinda cool, split screen

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
So I'm really looking forward to playing that at work

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
But, it's just so cheesy though

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
It's really worth picking up

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
The achievements are not easy in it

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
It's basically beating the game on each difficulty

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
And unlocking every single weapon

10:13.000 --> 10:13.000
That's your achievements

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Six achievements for 1,000 points

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
But, it's, you know, it's one of those games though

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
You have infinite ammo

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
And you have some weird weapons that are in the game

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
In fact, there's one missile that I unlocked in the very beginning

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
It's a piece of shit

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
It's the slowest moving missile I've ever seen

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
I mean, the thing is going, like, less than five miles an hour

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Just crawling across the air

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
And it doesn't hardly do any damage

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
But, it's fun because you can pick, you know, one of two weapons

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
To use each, throughout the whole game

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
So you just select your weapons, play your mission, and that's it

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And the best part about it though, you can blow up everything

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Buildings, doesn't matter, no one gives a crap

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Because you're saving the earth

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
So, what do I do? I just start launching random missiles

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Into every single skyscraper I see

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
And watching them all fall

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
And it's entertaining because they're there at the next level

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Because there's no continuity whatsoever

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
So do you recommend the game?

11:03.000 --> 11:03.000
I highly recommend the game

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Let me tell you, the frame rate's crap

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
The graphics suck, the sound is awful

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
And the voice acting's horrible

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
And the AI is pretty retarded as well

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
So are you saying it's so bad it's good?

11:15.000 --> 11:15.000
It is

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
It's the showgirls of video games?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
It's so bad, it's so bad

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
But that's the thing, you gotta play it

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Realizing that it's gonna suck in these areas

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
And to be honest, the graphics don't need to be that great

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
It's like an old arcade game

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
I mean, old arcade games, they're not that many polygons and stuff

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
But it works, it's just fun to play

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
So it may look like crap

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
It may be very fucking hard at times

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
The AI can be dumb

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Because I saw some soldier or whatever

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I was trying to find these people

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
So they would join me and help kill the alien ants

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
And this guy was shooting a shotgun into a building

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Because he was stupid and couldn't figure out how to get around the building

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
That's awesome

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
I don't know, it's funny

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
But it's still a lot of fun to play

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
It does not stop getting fun

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
So really highly recommend this game

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
It's only like 40 bucks for the 360

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Definitely worth picking up

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Even if you can find it used, that's even better

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
So I recommend it

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
It's a lot of fun

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
Definitely a lot better than from what I've heard from Armored Core 4

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
And other than that, I played Crackdown a little bit

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
That's about it though

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I've been just trying to get the last few achievements and stuff

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Kind of getting a little bored with the game

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Because now that you're at the end of the game and stuff

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
There's not much to do

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Oh, and Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
We've been playing that

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
At work we put custom firmwares in all of our PSPs now

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
So we're all playing it overclocked, which is fun

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
It actually looks a lot nicer

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
We have a guy that's working

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Actually he's a pretty famous cheat designer for the Vice City Stories

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
Durga Durga Man

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
He's working on a multiplayer code to switch out some of the weapons

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
And get some different stuff

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
So hopefully that'll happen

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And I am so looking forward to this week when the Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer hits on Friday

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
That is going to be awesome

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
I am going to watch that thing like 16 times on Friday

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Analyze every frame

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Oh yeah

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Alright, we'll be looking forward to your thoughts on that trailer on Sunday then

13:11.000 --> 13:11.000
Oh yeah

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Alright

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Miggletov, I noticed you snuck in here while we were starting the show

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
First off, hello, how are you doing?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Hello, I'm fine

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Alright, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Only been playing two things

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
World of Warcraft, I made my alternate character

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
His name is Agathon

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
And his pet is named Helo

13:32.000 --> 13:32.000
Oh my gosh, that's awesome

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Because I'm a big Battlestar nerd now

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Because it's so good

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
It is so good

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
It's the best and Helo's hot

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
And then other than that, finally at work

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Thanks to being at a developer place

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I've been playing a lot of Boom Boom Rocket

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
And it's the best game I've ever played in my life called Boom Boom Rocket

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
And it's pretty and I love it

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
I'm not sure how to take that

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
It's the best game you've ever played in your life called that

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
I could say Big Mother Truckers was the best game I ever played in my life

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
That's a lie, because it wasn't a good game at all

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
But Boom Boom Rocket, if I didn't have a 360, would sell me on a 360

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Because it's really just that much fun

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
What the hell is it? Because I still don't know that much about it

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Are you allowed to tell us what it is?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
I won't mention specifics, I don't know

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
It's not our game, I don't care

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
It's a music game with fireworks

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
So it's like Fantavision meets DDR with a touch of Beatmania

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Because the fireworks make noise for Beatmania

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
And if you hit arrows when you're not supposed to

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
It penalizes you like Beatmania does as well

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
So you can't just mess around

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
But the track list is not stellar, but it gets the job done

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
And if you like Fantavision and you like pretty things

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
It's really, really fun and lots of explosions

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
High def, good stuff?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah, oh my goodness

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I don't know, I must have played that a lot this week

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I got all the achievements, they're all really easy

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
Especially if you play music games

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
And it's just a whole lot of fun

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
I don't know, it almost convinced somebody at work to get a 360 too

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Because he was really enjoying it

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Interesting, so the music game fans will be all over this

15:19.000 --> 15:27.000
Maybe, it depends on if you care about the quality of music you're playing the game to

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Alpha Canogram says it sounds like every Xtend Xtra

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
No, because this game is good

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I liked every Xtend Xtra, whatever

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Every Xtend Xtra

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Music was a part of it, kind of like Rez

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
But Rez wasn't really a music game

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
The music was an important element

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
That's what every Xtend Xtra is like

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
This is a rhythm game, it's not a game where you blow something up to cause chain reactions

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Every time you hit one of those arrows, fireworks explosions happen

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
It's like DDR once you hit a hundred combo

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
You get a little flashy explosions

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
But there's timing issues with the game too

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
And I don't think they'll be fixed before

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I'm pretty sure what I was playing is the release candidate

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I just need it to come out now really bad

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
That's it

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Alright, we'll see what happens

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
My gaming week, interestingly enough

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
I don't know if you were listening last week

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
But I mentioned I was going to be going on vacation for a little while

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
So I have been on vacation the past four days in the middle of nowhere

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
I was up in the Mendocino, Fort Bragg, coastal area, Northern California

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
No internet, no phones, no games, really nothing

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
So it's just nice to have a break away from everything

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
I'll get into what effect that's going to have on tonight's show in just a minute

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
But yeah, I just took a break

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
But before I left, I did get to sneak in a little bit of Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Oh my heck, it is awesome

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
It's so great

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
Just the fact that they brought back one of the greatest video games of all time

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
And they didn't change much

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
They do have that enhanced mode

17:06.000 --> 17:12.000
Which basically means somewhat smoother, cleaner sprites and changed sound effects

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
But really they didn't change that much

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Don't let that talk of a new high def mode thing fool you

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
It still looks like the old PlayStation 1 game

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
But that's not a bad thing

17:22.000 --> 17:22.000
No, obviously

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Especially for Xbox Live Arcade

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Yeah, if it ain't broke, don't fix it

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Exactly, and really they didn't change anything

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
It's an awesome deal for $10

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
I mean, great, if you still have your old PlayStation hooked up

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
And you've got your disc available to play the PlayStation games or whatever

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Then have fun, go play the old version as you remember it

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
But for the rest of us, our PlayStations were thrown in the closet a long time ago

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
We lost our copies of Castlevania Symphony of the Night

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
This is awesome

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Didn't you mention something about no loading times or anything?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Oh yeah, there's no loading times

17:57.000 --> 17:57.000
You don't have to wait for anything

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
They kept all the voice acting intact

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
It's great, I mean, I definitely recommend

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Especially if you've never played it before

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Oh my gosh

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
It's got a lot of hours that you can put into the game if you've never played it before

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
There's no excuse to have never played that game before

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Like, I don't care

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
I'm looking in chatroom, Blay says Sky was a hippie for four days basically

18:19.000 --> 18:19.000
Yeah, basically

18:20.000 --> 18:20.000
When it comes down to it, I was

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah, so back to Symphony of the Night

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Well, I'll be playing plenty more Symphony of the Night now that I'm back from vacation

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
And another game I picked up today was Tetris Evolution on 360

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
But I've literally played it for 15 minutes, so I don't have enough to say on it

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
My initial impressions are, why didn't they just put this on Live Arcade?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
But then again, it was only $30, so it was a cheaper title

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
And the idea of being able to play Tetris on Xbox Live is pretty cool

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
But I'll give you my full thoughts on that next week

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Because it doesn't seem bad, but it doesn't seem as great as Tetris DS either

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
And those are just my initial five minute thoughts

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
But I'll look at it more in depth later

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
It looked okay, they had videos playing in the background

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
The HD videos looked pretty hot, so I'll give you that

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
But what was kind of interesting though is they also had

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
You can cheat in it just like you can with the Tetris DS

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
You can rotate blocks or whatever and then you can actually

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
Basically kind of hover them there forever until you decide where you want to put them

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
That's pretty sweet

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Alright, so I'll give you more thoughts on that next week here on the program

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
While I was out for four days, apparently some stuff has gone down on Live 365

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
And it has to do with this new CRB, the Copyright Royalty Board

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
If you want to know more information on it, go to www.live365.com slash choice

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
And of course, Live 365 is where we broadcast our live feed

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Obviously the live element is an important part of our show

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
We don't want it to go anywhere, so we suggest you guys all check this out

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
I know our buddy Travis Donovan went into detail on this on his program on Saturday night

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
I haven't had a chance to listen to it yet, so if you want to go check him out on iTunes under Travis Donovan

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
You can check out what he has to say on it

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
We don't know what we're going to do about this yet

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
We understand it has changed some rules already on Live 365

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Which may be kind of a pain in the butt to listen to us on Live 365

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
Long story short, we don't play enough ASCAP, BMI type music on this program

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
To justify if they're going to raise the rates much more of keeping Live 365

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
We don't know yet what we're going to do

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
We do have other offers on the table we're going to be looking at

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And if we have to go underground, we may just do that as well

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
But obviously the live element is an important factor of our show

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
And we don't want to lose that anytime soon

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
This shouldn't affect the podcast feed

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
Worst case scenario, if the rates of Live 365 had to go through the roof

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
We might have to go a couple of weeks with no live element

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
But we would find a new home, set up something on Shoutcast, I don't know

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
But seeing as we're Orange Mountains Radio is a bit of a network now

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Because we have some other great shows like STFU on Thursdays

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
And Travis Donovan on Saturdays

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
We don't want to lose any of those other shows that we've built up over time

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
More to come on that when we have some time to sit down and take this all in

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
What's going on with us

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Because again, I'm just getting back and kind of hitting all this news

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
And I want to check out what the rest of the OLR staff has to say about it

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
So we'll see

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Travis Donovan is in chat and says

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Urges folks to visit Live 365.com slash choice

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
And says you all need to contact your local congress person

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
And let them know they need to level the playing field again

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Over the air radio does not pay royalty rates

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
But internet and satellite radio must

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Doesn't sound very fair to me

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
And it's going to hurt the little guys like us and other great Live 365

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
And just internet radio stations in general

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
So that kind of sucks

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
So we'll have more info on that next week

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
We'll see

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Also, as far as housekeeping goes

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Tonight we're going to change things up a little bit

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Dark Sakura's not here

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
And I, of course, have been out of town for the last four days

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
So I'm a little bit out of the loop on gaming news

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
So Loki's going to be news boy tonight

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
And all of our news tonight will be presented by Loki

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
So we are going to break our usual format a little bit

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
So take it away Loki, what happened this week?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Hooray, well the big thing that happened, of course

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
At least if you're in the UK and most of the other world

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
The PlayStation 3 finally came out for you

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
That time has finally come

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
You can finally buy your overpriced gaming machine

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
And there were some interesting stories coming out about that

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Of course, one that pretty much sums everything up

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Phil Harrison

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
Basically was saying that Europe is the most important continent

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
For the gaming industry

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
Which is funny because it was also the last one to get the PlayStation 3

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
But apparently the third is also the most important

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
And he was told

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
You know, this gameindustry.biz

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Big industry site

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
It's got the most countries and it's got the most people

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
It's also got the most cultures

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
The fact that we've got the launch here

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
With more consoles shipped on day one

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Than we've ever had in our history

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Is a compliment to the most important market

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Of the world, the European market

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I don't know, that sounds a lot of sucking up to me

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Especially since

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
What?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
They've had so many delays, they've had to pay more

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
They didn't get the 20 YIG model at launch

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
Oh, and which we'll get into a little bit later

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Their backwards compatibility has kind of been

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Hurt a little bit

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
So

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
I don't know, I think it's kind of stupid

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
This strikes me as nothing more than fluffy PR

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Nothing less, nothing more

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
This is just nice little sound bite statements

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Made by official Sony people to get all over the Europe press

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
About how freaking important they are blah blah blah

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
And believe me, listeners abroad

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
I'm not trying to belittle the situation

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
But obviously

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
If Sony cared that much

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
They would have done things a little differently, correct?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
But oh wait, it doesn't stop there

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
To prove that point

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
They even went out of their way to give out free TVs

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
To the first 100 people purchasing the Playstation 3

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
At their London launch event

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Free 46 inch HDTVs

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
And a free taxi ride home with those

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Jesus, that's not a bad deal

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Where's my damn TV?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
I want to know

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Wait, the 100 people that sat out online

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Like this incentive to wait in the cold or whatever?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Yeah

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
So in the US, you have to wait two days

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
And dodge bullets

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
Maybe have to race and slam into a pole

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
And get sent to the hospital in a coma

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
Exactly, and then in the UK you get free TVs

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
To go with your gaming systems and stuff

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Yeah, Raven's Dolphin in chat says

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
We get shot, they get TVs, what the fuck?

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
That's a big PR

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Is that just because British people are nicer, or what is that?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Maybe

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Is that to encourage people to actually go outside and wait in line or what?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Well, they didn't know that this was going to happen

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
This was just something that they did

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
I mean, if they said, hey, by the way, we're going to give away free 46 inch TVs

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Everyone would have been there

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
It would have been like the opening of an Ikea

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
When Ikea's open, everybody knows

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
The first people in line get huge certificates

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
And suddenly the lines are around the block

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Yeah

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Well, that's interesting, though

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
That they didn't announce that

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Because why wouldn't they announce it

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
And get the long lines for the media to photograph

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
So they can go, hey, look how popular the PS3 is in Europe

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Even though they had to wait six months for it

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
But here's the thing, though

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
If they did something like that, they'd be like, yeah, but it's only because you're giving away free TVs

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
I mean, it's not because of the PlayStation 3

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
And they would have just spun it that way

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I think this is just kissing ass

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
It's a whole lot of kissing ass

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
It's like, please don't be mad at us that we waited so long

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
And you have to pay more for a system that actually does less

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
Please don't be mad

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
Joshi16 says, Sony was eating crayons

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
They weren't eating crayons

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
They were just kissing ass

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
That's all it was

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Now, GS68 says, doesn't free stuff, bundles with something up the price

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
But you're saying these are absolutely free TVs

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
That they gave away to the first

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Absolutely free

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Is it the UK Retailer London store?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
I think so

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
It was where they were doing their launch event

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Where the Sony president would be heading out the first PS3 type thing

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
Something like that

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
I don't know

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Anyways, along the lines of that

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
The UK Retailer game

26:19.000 --> 26:26.000
They were quoted as saying that they were very happy with the amount of supply and demand that they had for the console

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
And it was actually the first time that they were actually able to fulfill all the demand in short term

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
So that's something that's never happened before

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
Sony withheld the release of the PS3 in order to build up stock levels for the launch

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
The situation with the Xbox 360 was terrible

26:44.000 --> 26:47.000
And the Wii doesn't even hit the sides when it comes in

26:47.000 --> 26:56.000
I think it's a very good move on Sony's part, it won't have that negativity of not being able to supply enough units

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
So that's good that they're able to supply enough units

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I don't know if that's really an issue though

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I think the demand is just less for it

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Cool that they have enough units out there

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Unfortunately though

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
And it kind of gets into that whole demand thing

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Because outside of the launch event

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
It wasn't so pretty for Sony

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
In fact, there was a few situations where you only had a few people lining up for the system and no one cared

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
For example, Virgin Megastore

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
They had some campers outside

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
But it was really only about three or so people that were waiting in line for the system

27:39.000 --> 27:45.000
And a lot of other stores, there were some situations where they were breaking street in Italy and stuff like that

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
And there's also stuff where people were just not coming in pre-ordering or even buying the system at all

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
So a lot of people said, who cares at this point

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I don't know, so it's kind of negative a little bit

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
What do you think made the UK folks not want to line up for it?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Do you think it was because of what happened over here?

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
Do you think maybe they just don't get excited like this?

28:09.000 --> 28:12.000
Although I seem to think that I remember the UK folks were lining up for the Wii and everything

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
They don't want to line up for it because it costs too much and it's a stupid system

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
There you go

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Why? Why is it a stupid system?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Because it has no games on it

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
It has everything you can get on the 360 except resistance

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
But Gundam!

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Jokes

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
And the only thing cool about the PS3 is that stupid home thing that's coming out this summer or fall or whatever and I want that

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
But other than that, it's stupid

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Yeah, I think it's a little bit what Shane said, maybe not so harsh

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
It's not a lot of games out there right now

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Not a lot of exclusive stuff that's really must have

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
It's really one of those systems that maybe it's better off to wait when the price comes down a little bit and there's more of a library

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Also, they were kind of getting shafted for a while

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
A lot of people that were waiting the six months or whatever

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Not six months

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Four months

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Three months to get the system

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Probably say, hey, you know what?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Maybe 360 is a little bit better

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
Maybe I should just pick this up now

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
Because I can get it now and there's a big library of games out there

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Or get the Wii

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Making them wait for a while

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
If they're really itching to get their grasp of the new game systems

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
They're just going to go someplace else and get something that's out now

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
I don't know

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
They're really having a hard time distinguishing themselves as why you need this system

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
So that's one thing

29:31.000 --> 29:36.000
The UK didn't have the only problems with launches

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Australia, the launch wasn't very great over there

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
In fact, their launch event only drew about 40 people

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I had read that a lot of these launch events were getting cancelled

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
Because of the fear of gunshots and all the crap that happened here

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
I didn't hear too many of that

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
But I know the ones that they were talking about in Australia

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
They had about maybe 40 people show up

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Another 30 that were press

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
And it was pretty much like kind of

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I don't know, just people weren't really excited about it

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
I don't know if it's just because not a lot of people were pre-ordering them

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
Or just no one really wanted them

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Rice Princess, you'd want to comment earlier but got cut off

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
I know, I was just going to say they're all busy playing Wii bowling

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
They're too busy to go stand out in line and wait for Sony?

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Yeah, because they're playing a good system

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Because they're playing Wii bowling, okay

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Would you have camped out for this?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
No

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
Let's say you had the money

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Let's say you had 600 euros, dollars, whatever right now

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Would you go camp out?

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
No, because I probably already have a Wii

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
And I don't have a desire to have a PS3

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
I'd be spending my time on the Wii

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
I've got a question for you

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
You've been very vocal about your hate for Xbox on this show previously

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Would you buy an Xbox at this point before Playstation 3?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
If I had?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
In terms of if I had to

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Because obviously I wouldn't buy it on my own

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
But if I had to

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Probably

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
I probably would

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Huh, that's a very interesting thing

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Miklotov wants to comment, he's dying over there

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Why would they be playing Wii bowling?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
Because the Wii sucks

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
I don't like it

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Wait a minute, wait so you hate the Wii and the Playstation 3?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
Yes, I like the 360

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I seem to recall though on this program you were very excited about the Wii

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
I was

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
When did this change in heart happen?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Well it was when Nintendo decided that they were too good to release games anymore

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
And I don't want to play crappy games

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
And that's all they've been giving us lately

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
You do this all the time though, to be fair

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
I distinctly remember you sold your Xbox 360 back for the same reason

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
How many PS2's have I had?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
When Final Fantasy 11 came out you bought a new one eventually

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Because you were like, ooh I have to be a corsair because they're pretty

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
I mean, have you sold your Wii back at this point?

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
No, but my Wii has been broken since I got it

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
And I have my little return sticker for Nintendo

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
I need to call and get a new one actually

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
But I have no desire to send it back because

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
What am I going to play on it right now?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Sell it, I mean seriously you can sell it

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
They're going for a lot of money right now because they can't find them

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
And people want them

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
So if you don't want yours, might as well sell it

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
But at the end of the year you're going to get your Mario Galaxy

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
Your Metroid, you're going to want one anyway

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
I have no desire for Mario Galaxy thanks to Sunshine

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
But Metroid, yeah, Smash Brothers, yeah

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
Maybe they'll have another color by then

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
I'm a color whore anyway

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
I want something you'll talk about later

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Let's see

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Let's see

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
Let's see

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
Joshi16 says the exact same thing happened on the DS, don't act surprised

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
What, the

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
Oh, I was thinking the color changes, like yeah

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
But oh, the lack of games

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
Lack of games

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
Yeah, but you know what, I could play some good games on like

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
From Game Boy Advance

32:53.000 --> 32:54.000
I could play GameCube games on this and not be fulfilled

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Because GameCube games aren't that good either

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Blaze says die, Miklotov die

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
You can die too

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Tetsuya says Miklotov's Wii's been broken

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Which SakuraMax follows right up with

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Don't worry, Mama will fix it

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
That's creepy and so quit talking please

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
For the record

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
If you listen to last week's program I was all excited about playing Cookie Mama this week

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
I went to Toys R Us today to try to get it when I bought Tetris

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Because I had something to take back so I had a credit there anyway

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
And they told me it didn't come out until next week

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
It came out last week

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
They're retarded

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
They're just lying to me, to my face

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
Yeah, they have old information or their shipments didn't come in

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
Bitch!

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
It's not, it was not something that was delayed

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
It's been out there

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000
I've heard the games being crap reviews anyway

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
I'm a little worried

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
I saw it, let me put it this way, I saw Blockbuster yesterday

33:46.000 --> 33:47.000
So I know it's out there, I don't know

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
It just, I looked at it and I'm like

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
Mama needs to fix her shipping dates, that's what she needs to fix

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
I'm like, I'm not even going to rent this

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
No thank you

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I know I'm going to buy it because I'm dumb

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Cookie Mama on the Wii

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Oh my god, that looks so great, I want it

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
But it's been getting negative reviews everywhere

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
It looks great but it controls like crap

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Why would you be excited for it?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
Because you're a woman and you do that already

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
But not on a DS

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
On a Wii, stupid!

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
Or on a Wii, shut up

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
It's really disappointing that it controls like crap

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
Because I was hoping that it would be, it looked fun

34:21.000 --> 34:22.000
And the DS one looked fun too

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
It's just, well there were some control issues

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
And it really, that frustrates the hell out of you

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
More comments from chat, I'm really relying on chat tonight

34:30.000 --> 34:31.000
Because I have not been reading the internet this week

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Zappy says the original Cookie Mama got bad reviews too

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Because it had control issues

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
It has control issues

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Let's see, Skylark makes a good point

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And says, luckily Super Paper Mario comes out in a few weeks

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
What, you're booing Super Paper Mario, Mikotov?

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
The crap, what's wrong with Super Paper Mario, it looks great

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
I don't like it because it is a Paper Mario title

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
And I don't like Paper Mario games

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
And I know it's a freaking platformer game

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
But I'm sick of platformers

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
And I hate everything, so there

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Well you heard about the Power Rangers game that's coming out

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
Just kidding, I got you

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Sucker!

35:12.000 --> 35:17.000
Blaze wanted to point out, Mikotov just won my love back, lol

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
No one makes Power Rangers games anymore

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
And GS68 says Cooking Milf

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Maybe that'll be the sequel, Cooking Milf

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
That's wrong

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Something else is wrong

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Is removing the Emotion Engine out of the Playstation 3

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
To cut down costs

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
Granted, okay, I will give them this

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
It does now, they have with the new version 1.6 firmware

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
The original Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
Actually I think more Playstation 2

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Are emulated now with the Emotion

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Like kind of a software emulation instead of hardware

35:53.000 --> 35:59.000
So of the 2,451 Playstation 2 titles in the European region

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Only 1,782 titles work

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Which to be honest though

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
That's a lot better than the 360

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
That is a lot better than the 360

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Of course, what does that really mean?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Because that's a lot of titles

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
But maybe it's a lot of barbie horse adventures type stuff

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Really how much of this stuff am I going to want to play

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
And which games are working, not working, etc.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
And I'm trying to remember here

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
I want to say of the list that they were saying that weren't working

36:30.000 --> 36:37.000
I want to say Final Fantasy VII, Resident Evil 2, Ratchet and Clank, Metal Gear Solid 2

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Those are some of the PS1 games that weren't working

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
And let's see, big name issues

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
There was 550 of the games that had noticeable issues

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
According to Sony

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Among the big name titles like Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider 2 on the Playstation 1

36:55.000 --> 37:01.000
Final Fantasy X, Kingdom Hearts, Sing Star, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas on the Playstation 2

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Those are all ones that didn't work

37:05.000 --> 37:06.000
Those are all ones that had noticeable issues

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Lame

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
To be fair though

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
1700 titles for your system that are backwards compatible

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
A lot better than over 300 for the 360

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
I guess that's true

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
They're working on it

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
So give them some credit, that's a lot more than I was expecting to work with the system

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
They're doing something right at least

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
But I still think it's kind of crappy that it's software emulation now

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
Who cares though, I have one of the original Playstation 3's and it plays on hardware emulation

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
So who cares

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Pardon me for a minute, I have a sidebar issue completely unrelated to take care of

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Why is it when I got up to sneak to go use the bathroom

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
The magic of radio I can get up and leave and you don't even know

37:47.000 --> 37:54.000
But yet I noticed in chat I suddenly said I'm Rob, I'm so flamey blah blah blah

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
Wow Rob you're amazing

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
I'm going to let you take a guess who said that

38:00.000 --> 38:01.000
Yeah it was probably Miklotov

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
You're probably right

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
They're pointing back and forth at each other

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
You guys are jerks

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
Banned from the show forever

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
It was funny though

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
With the Playstation 1.6 firmware for the Playstation 3

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
You got some other stuff

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Not just some backwards compatibility

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
Wait hold on I want to comment on the whole backwards compatibility thing

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
It sucks

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
That's all

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
Well here's the thing

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
What else is there to say

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
I don't know it's weird

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
But at the same time I do feel like if you're going to buy a Playstation 3

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
You know I called in to All Games Radio very randomly on Tuesday or Wednesday

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
One of the days before I leave to talk about this

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
And I kind of made a little joke

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
Because I don't know they were doing something on there

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
They were joking that the whole cast of OLR was at the Sony factory doing backwards compatibility

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Don't ask I don't remember what it was

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
So I called in pretending to be at the Sony factory

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
I made this little joke about

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
If you're going to buy a Playstation 3 to play all your old Playstation 2 games

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Maybe you ought to save $400 fucking dollars and buy a Playstation 2

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Right fair

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
So I don't know why

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
At one point I do want to go well that kind of sucks

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
You can't play all your old games

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
But seeing as the system doesn't really upscale it yet

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Like it was supposed to right

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Actually the software emulation will allow it to upscale

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
So that is good

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
But it's not that big a deal

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
It's not that big a deal

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
It's not going to suddenly make your games HD beautiful blah blah blah

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
It's just going to be a little bit smoother

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
Honestly ask yourself

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
I mean really if you've got a Playstation 3

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And you're really gearing to play some next gen games

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Are you really playing Playstation 1 games?

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
I'm not I have Playstation 2 games

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
I have a Playstation 2 as well

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
I don't touch the thing

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
I don't play any of those games

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
I'm playing new stuff

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
If I really want to go back and play Kingdom Hearts 2 or whatever

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
I'll play it on my Playstation 2

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
I mean Playstation 2's are still selling really well

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
Exactly

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
They're sort of readily available out there

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
And they're not that expensive

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
And they'll probably drop in price again

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Once we get down to Christmas time again

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
At the same time though

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
I do get a little irritated

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Like when Xbox 360 talks about how they're going to abandon

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Pretty much the old Xbox stuff come 2008

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
I think we had a story on that last week

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
And I know people go

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Well why don't you just play it on your old Xbox blah blah blah blah

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
But I don't know

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
Sometimes I don't feel like cooking

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I don't feel like cooking the game systems

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
So it is kind of convenient sometimes to be able to do the backwards compatibility thing

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
It is

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
And it's a nice thing that they've added

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
I mean since I think was it

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
The Playstation 2 was the first system to actually do that

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
And it was a great selling point

40:41.000 --> 40:41.000
It plays all your Playstation 1 games

40:42.000 --> 40:43.000
It actually makes them run a little bit better

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
You can do better graphics or you know

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Better load times

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
So that was kind of cool

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Which I might add

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Playstation 3 load times kind of suck on certain games

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
If you were going to install it through the hard drive that would be really nice

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
But either way

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
It's still

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
I would say though

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
1700 games working for your system is a lot better than 300

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
Okay

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
That's something that they've got

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
But the Xbox did not have as big of a library as the Playstation 2

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
Because they didn't have anything before Xbox

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
Microsoft didn't compete with Playstation 1

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
And really I'm hoping that they do stick on

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
You know

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
The backwards compatibility instead of just saying

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
Ah fuck it you know we got this mini to work so

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
That's it

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
We're done

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
SSJ100Matt says it's funny that Microsoft killed the Xbox One right away

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
And Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 are still around

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
I don't know so much about Playstation 1

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
But certainly Playstation 2 still got quite a bit of life

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
It seems left in it

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Oh yeah

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
I don't know if God of War 2 is like it's last gasp of air

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Or if that's going to be the last big game

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
That may be the last Sony game

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
That may be the last games throughout the year

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
That are coming out for the Playstation 2

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
And I'm sure we'll get Sudoku Master for years to come

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
On Playstation 2

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
I played a lot of Sudoku

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
When you don't have a PSP or a DS

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
It's all about Sudoku

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
It's cheap to develop for

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
That's what it is

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
It's the one system that has the largest user base out there

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Over three times of what the 360 has

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
And of course they're going to still make games for it

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
I mean 30 million people have the damn system

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
It would be dumb not to make games for it

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
But I mean certain games like the new Ghost Recon games

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
And stuff like that

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
You just can't do them on the Playstation 2

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
You've got to cut your costs

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Either make the next gen version look pretty

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Or just skip the current gen one

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
Maybe do something like EA is doing

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Like Medal of Honor Vanguard for the Wii and Playstation 2

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
And then make a new one

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Medal of Honor Airborne

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
For the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
That way everybody's happy

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
And they've saved their costs a little bit on the games

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
That don't necessarily need the huge graphic budgets

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
And stuff like that

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Let me quickly go to another sidebar comment

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
And then we'll get back into the news here

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
The comments from the chat room

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
This is an interesting conversation

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
JVmon says, if you have a Playstation 3

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Why the hell are you still playing Final Fantasy 7?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
And then ShadowNextGen says, JVmon Final Fantasy 7 is a classic

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
That I will always play

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
And then moving on

43:11.000 --> 43:14.000
Let's see, JVmon says then play it on your Playstation 2

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
And Hippolytus says this

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
He says, I for example never owned a Playstation

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
I think he means PS1

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
But now that I have a Playstation 2

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
I can play Playstation 1 games

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
But that begs the comment

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
How many people do you know that's actually going to go get a Playstation 3

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
Who never had a Playstation 2?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
But I do know of one person

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
I do have a friend who's considering getting a Playstation 3

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
And he never had a Playstation 2 or a Playstation 1

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
He's thinking about getting it

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Because he can play all the backwards compatible stuff

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
In this country you still can

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
If this is a big concern for them

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
I would recommend that they do

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
And it's going to be a different SKU

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Or a slightly different item

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Not item member

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
They're Sony item members

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Either way, you're going to be able to look on the box

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
And tell which version of the Playstation 3 this is

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
The one that has

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
One of the original launch ones

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
Or one of the ones that got the

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
65 nanometer chips in them

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
And it's software emulation now

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
So if it's a real big concern for your backwards compatibility

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Make sure you get one of the older ones

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
And that's all you really need to do

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
Or buy an older one that's used or something

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
I'd recommend that's the case

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Because really it's going to drop in price

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Probably in the fall

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
I mean they probably will need to

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
Especially if Microsoft drops their price

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
But the thing is

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
That it's going to come at a cost

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
You're not going to have that chip on there

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
And they've already said they're going to take it out

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
For the US ones

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
So if it's a real big deal for you

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Maybe spend the extra money

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
I mean it's either that or you're going to spend another

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
$99 on a Playstation 2

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
So pick your poison

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
I mean this way you get a larger hard drive

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
With it at the same time

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
You can buy a more expensive system or something

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
I don't know

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
Anyways

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
So back to the Playstation 3 1.6

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Oh firmware that's out there

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Finally they've added

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Background downloading

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Something that they should have had from the beginning

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Because this thing downloads like

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Fucking slow

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Well to be fair 360 didn't have it at first

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
It badly needed it too

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
But I would have hoped that since

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
The Playstation 3 came out a year later

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
That they would kind of learn from

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
I'll give you that

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Either way so now it does work

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
And it is confirmed that it will work

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
While you're watching a blu-ray movie

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Or playing an offline game

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Not an online game

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Basically the same rules as a 360

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
So that's kind of cool

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Another thing

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Well and also kind of another thing

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
Why would you really need background downloading

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Because there's not a lot to download on the store right now

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
So anyways

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
Another thing that does add

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
And this is kind of neat

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Is that folding at home

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
That basically the kind of program

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
That runs in the background to help

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Crunch numbers to figure out

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
How to come up with cures for diseases and whatnot

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
Interesting enough

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
This was released this week

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
The firmware update

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
And already the Playstation 3

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
Is processing a lot more

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Numbers than anything else

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
In fact even more than

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Most of the Windows PC's out there

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Right now they are currently

46:24.000 --> 46:25.000
Doing what was it

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
251 teraflops

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Which you know that's

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
100 trillion

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
More than

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
They were saying that

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
The Playstation 3 machines are delivering

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
Over 251 trillion

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Floating point operations per second

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
100 trillion more than

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
10 times the number of

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Active PC CPU's

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
Is this folding at home thing

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Forgive my ignorance a little bit

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Because I don't have a Playstation 3 so I haven't been really following this very much

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
But is this something that you

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
It automatically kind of stealth installs in your Playstation 3

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
And just runs without you knowing it

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
I think you have to download this

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Or it's basically a

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
I'm not sure if it's included with the update

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
If it is included with the update it's a program you have to run

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
It runs almost like a screen saver

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
And it will crunch numbers

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
But yet for a PC

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
You would have to elect to download this

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
And kind of seek it out right

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Yes but the thing is though you have to run it

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
In order for it to actually run

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
It's not something that will run automatically

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
So

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Kind of like distributed net

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
Because I used to run that back in college

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
It's basically like the old study at home

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Little cow icon

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
Except you know now instead of searching

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
For extraterrestrial life

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Because I guess they gave up on that

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Instead of that they're looking to

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
You know

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Cure cancer

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
I can't wait for the press release

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
When one of these Playstation 3's

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Happens to crunch the magical number

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
To cure cancer

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Sony cures cancer

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
I mean I can see that PR right now

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
Joshi16 in chat says

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Cure cancer

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
1000 gamer points and a home trophy

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
There you go

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Yeah I want the cure cancer trophy

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Anyways

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
On to a completely different system and subject

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
This rumor of the

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Black Xbox 360 just will never die

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
And it's now confirmed to be real

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Probably why the rumor never died

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
And the latest issue of Game Informer magazine

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
Which further goes to show

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Microsoft rumors 90% of the time

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Unless you made it up yourself

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Microsoft rumors are always true

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Always true

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
It has been announced at least through

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
According to the article in Game Informer

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Not officially announced yet but anyways

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
An HDMI enabled black unit

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Is coming out for $479

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
It's going to be a limited edition

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
In black it will be in white later

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
But limited edition for

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Yeah $479

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
And

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
It's supposed to have a larger hard drive

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
120 gigabytes

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
And other rumored options with this

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Is that it's supposed to also have black accessories

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Coming out for it

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
So eventually you'll see different colored controllers and whatnot

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
And one thing also they were talking about

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Is the IPTV is supposed to be enabled in it as well

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
So that's something interesting

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
If you've already spent the money though

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
On your 360

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
You'll be happy to know there will be a larger hard drive

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Coming out for under $200

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
And the other rumor with that is

49:34.000 --> 49:37.000
That there is going to be a data cable included with the new 360

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
And a new hard drive that will allow you to be able to hook up your old hard drive

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
To transfer any saves you have

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
So I hope that's true

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
Well Microsoft rumors usually end up being true

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
So that would make sense

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
But interesting

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
I don't know I can't get too excited about the black Xbox 360

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
Because I think well the first Xbox was black and nobody cared

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Well it's going to be called the elite

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
I mean that's what they're calling it right now

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
The core system is not going away

50:08.000 --> 50:09.000
The premium system is not going away

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
It's basically this is just going to be another skew that's added on

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
And eventually it will become a white system

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
I'm not sure if it's going to replace the premium system or not

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
But they're going to eventually all be white

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
So I don't know it's interesting

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Hopefully we'll see a price drop for the core

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Because that would be kind of nice

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
I heard they're ditching the core

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
I don't know

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
I would think they would because they want to urge people to download movies and stuff

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
So that means you have to have a hard drive right

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
Yeah but at the same time they want to still be able to compete against the Wii and stuff

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I mean they've got to have that lower price point out there

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Drop the premium to $299 there you go

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Yeah that would be good

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I think if they do a price drop to drop it to $299

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
They could keep the core around for like $199 or something like that

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
If they're not going to keep it around then so be it

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
So they'll have a unit that's not out there

51:06.000 --> 51:11.000
Shadownextgen says a new Xbox 360 hard drive for under $200 equals $199.99

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
If I were to guess actually

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
I can't remember because originally the core system

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
It was $299 and the hard drive is $99

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
So that would equal $399 roughly

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
This is $479

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
So I don't know

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Core system plus new hard drive

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
I'm guessing the hard drive is $179.99

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
That would be my guess

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
Blaze says Sky new colors always make people go ooooh

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
I don't know I kind of like the white because for my setup it's kind of nice

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Because my Ikea TV table is a light color

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
And then you have the white Wii on one side and the white Xbox 360 on the other side

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Everything looks nice

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Rob you got to understand though people are stupid and they will buy different colored stuff

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
I can understand for the HDMI cable the bigger hard drive and that stuff

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
I don't know I'm not going to get it

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
I might get the new hard drive or something if I really need it or something

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
But I don't need the HDMI my TV doesn't have HDMI so that's a big deal

52:16.000 --> 52:22.000
Black I couldn't give a crap if the thing was bright green or pink or something

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Who cares

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
Ravenstaufen wants to know if you've seen this through your insider sources

52:29.000 --> 52:33.000
Nope because certain companies will not talk about stuff before it needs to be out there

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
Certain companies are a little better about keeping tabs on that stuff than others

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony they're an expert in the PR department

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
And they will not leak crap like this out there

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
In fact I'm surprised that it would even be out there in some of those system stuff

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Unless they're doing like test stuff I don't know

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
But yeah this stuff will not be out there until they want it to be out there

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Anyways

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
So other stuff about that

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Well actually they don't really have anything else other than that

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Hopefully April I mean it's not that far away so

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
If we're going to hear an update about this it's going to be pretty damn soon

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
So keep your eyes peeled for an actual press release about this

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
And hopefully more exciting stuff to come from

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Does Microsoft have any events coming up in April where they could drop this bombshell

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
No but I think they're getting close to the end of their fiscal year

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
So I don't know

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
That might be good to make boost stock prices or something

53:30.000 --> 53:34.000
Anyways on to the final new system out there the Wii

53:34.000 --> 53:40.000
They are getting the final version of the internet channel towards the end of April

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
And it's supposed to be having some more features added to it

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
I believe they're improving the

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Like getting rid of that goddamn bar that sits at the bottom of your page?

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
I hope so I can't remember I have to find the exact details for it

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
But I remember improved zooming auto resizing of text

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
I think they're improving the little virtual keyboard that's on there

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
So that has like some more preset stuff like www. and html and stuff like that

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
So that stuff on there

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
Hopefully they're removing the little bar on there

54:17.000 --> 54:23.000
And I think they're extending the free web browser until June now

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Well that's a nice thing to do considering a lot of people that want to get Wii still can't get them

54:27.000 --> 54:35.000
The web browser is five bucks when they start charging for it

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
I don't know I can't see how that would be

54:40.000 --> 54:45.000
You know the Wii web browser has been getting a little bit of play in this house

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Because we use it for YouTube

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
When there's like seven people over we want to show something funny on YouTube

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
Like hey look at this Kelly video on YouTube because you're the only person on the planet that still hasn't seen it

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
We'll go to YouTube and bring it up on the TV and it's kind of cool except for that bar

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
That sits at the bottom of the page and kind of eats up all the space

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Or porno tube

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Or porno tube is also yeah I remember the New Year's party good times

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
Good times

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Yes it's a gateway to porn

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Anyways

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Back on the subject of the Wii here

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
EAA announced a brand new game for the Wii called Boogie

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
This was I think we had covered a story

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
They were talking about how there was going to be a 70's style music game coming out for the Wii

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
And I believe this is it

55:33.000 --> 55:34.000
Is this the harmonix partnership?

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
No

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Because there's that going on too right?

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
I seem to remember last week there was some sort of from game developers conference

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
EA said we're going to get in bed with harmonix for one game type thing going on

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
Is this related?

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
I don't think this has anything to do with harmonix

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Alright just curious

55:53.000 --> 55:58.000
It's basically a Wii exclusive game and you're going to be using the nunchuck as well as the remotes to disco dance

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
And your character kind of looks almost like I don't know definitely not human

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
But there's these evil looking peak men things in the background

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
Everybody disco dancing

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
So it's interesting what they're doing with that

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Could be kind of fun I don't know

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
So I'm looking forward to it

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
That should be out later this year of course no specific anything

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
Still a little vague for me

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
I want to know more about like you know were there videos out there of people playing it

56:27.000 --> 56:28.000
Pictures

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
Looks pretty good

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Another thing that was announced or at least reconfirmed

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
Guitar Hero for the Wii is supposed to be coming out

56:38.000 --> 56:42.000
And they're saying that they're going to actually be doing controllers as well that look like guitars

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
Not a big surprise

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
And yeah kind of going back to when they were talking about

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Wait they're going to make controllers that look like guitars?

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
That's what they were saying

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
But wouldn't that be a given because Guitar Hero uses a guitar controller

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
Or are they saying that feasibly you're going to be able to play this game with no special controller

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
I think they're actually making new controllers for it

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Because

57:05.000 --> 57:13.000
Yeah they said it says the Colt rhythm game Guitar Hero is on its way to the Wii it comes with a guitar shaped controller

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
And plays convincingly enough to make you think you're making real music

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
Hopefully we'll get the actual guitar and not pretend we're up

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
So it's speculation never mind

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
So no idea if they're going to actually have a real guitar thing

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
I would hope that they're going to if they want to cut costs you know

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
Just make a plugin for like the Wiimote you know stick it in there

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
I mean because the things made to build off of it you know that's why they have that stupid little

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
Almost like a USB thing on the bottom for all those attachments

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
Build something that works onto it like slide the guitar or the Wiimote into the guitar

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
I don't like this whole thinning of the Guitar Hero franchise amongst all the consoles you know

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
I already passed on Guitar Hero 2 for Playstation because I knew the 360 version was coming

57:57.000 --> 58:05.000
And now I don't know I don't know what the Wii version is going to have to really have something special to make me want to buy another guitar controller

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
And another you know I kind of wish they would put out a guitar that would just work on all the systems

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
Kind of like you can get DDR pads to do that

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
Yeah

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
I'll be nice

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
Then let's see here have one more story and I think you talked about this a little bit last week Rob

58:19.000 --> 58:27.000
And it's been finally confirmed a Nintendo rep has confirmed individual friends list for the Wii titles

58:28.000 --> 58:35.000
So yes they have worked they have done nothing to change the fucking hassle that was DS friends list system

58:36.000 --> 58:44.000
And basically they've said I can confirm that the friend code system in the Wi-Fi connection service for the Wii will be the same as it was for the Nintendo DS

58:44.000 --> 58:52.000
Meaning game specific friend codes and separate friends rosters are used in each game where players can play with identified friends

58:53.000 --> 58:59.000
As with the Nintendo DS the system was created to ensure gaming environment is kept fun for everyone

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
Except for the people that have to enter in the 5000 codes for each damn game

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Retarded

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
I just I don't know I talked about this so I was blue in the face last night I just don't get it

59:12.000 --> 59:17.000
Rice Brothers you weren't here last week what do you think of this whole friend codes thing on the Wii

59:18.000 --> 59:21.000
That you're going to have to basically enter in your friend code every time to get new players

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
What that's dumb

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
Like you do on the DS right you know how you do that on the DS you enter a friend code now you have to do the same thing on the Wii

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
Even though we already put in friend codes to send the messages back and forth you have to do it for every single game

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
Because heaven forbid you get a I don't know a predator on Wii or something

59:37.000 --> 59:44.000
I hope I hope that these that this is something that's not required for like third parties or something this this could be fun

59:45.000 --> 59:51.000
I'm fine with the first party stuff if they're doing what they want to do that great but I you know so far with like Konami

59:52.000 --> 01:00:00.000
They have a little bit so we connect 24 stuff you know I'm I don't know I don't well I guess that's not really playing with anyone online though

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:10.000
That's just exchanging like levels or something so I still think it's retarded though it why would you want to be a friend in one game and not another

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I why it doesn't make any sense no sense whatsoever I don't understand why they have to complicate things

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And I'm sure they got an over you know what was the response to the DS one I mean no one I think actually was positive on it

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Everyone was like this fucking sucks so what would make you decide hmm people really hated it before let's do it again that'd be awesome

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I mean really what was the thought behind this I don't get it

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Maybe there wasn't any thought

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I mean people aren't really being kidnapped with the goddamn DS I mean seriously

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Skylark says friend codes are horrible haven't Nintendo learned anything I'd rather take the risk of meeting child molesters than not be able to play online at all

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And really how hard is it anyways to add someone I mean you just put in a friend code it's basically like accepting like hitting yes or something

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I mean people you they won't people can add you to their friends list but you have to add them back first so it would be just like you know if I send a friend request to somebody they don't have to agree to do it

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
So why just leave it as yes no instead of numbers I don't know why you have to complicate things

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Maury in our chat room live on this Sunday evening at chat.org.com says it's a really flawed system especially considering Nintendo's justification

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Qwhat5565 says Nintendo can't be that stupid they have to be coming out with an easier add-on maybe a report button

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Well I mean here let me put it this way we still got time until the first you know online game comes out this could change before then

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
But not really because we've had Elibits and that worked fine but I know you don't play versus or whatever but

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:10.000
I'm just saying right now though they could change I hope they change it I mean I really do because it's just a pain in the ass it really is

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I'm glad that they want to protect the children out there from you know child molesters and stuff to be honest I don't think you're really gonna have that problem

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Because you don't have video chat you don't really have voice chat you don't have even normal chat it's just fucking exchanging messages back and forth like you know email

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I don't see what the big deal is just just put yes or no I mean is that so hard instead of having to enter and people put their damn friend codes on websites anyways

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
And they exchange them that way so how is that any different than you know yes or no

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:52.000
You know what we should do is create a website childmolesterfriendcodes.com and like encourage you know people to use the friend code systems to meet child molesters

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Obviously I'm joking people but you know I mean Loki brings up a good point you can trade codes online with complete strangers who might turn out to be people you don't expect them to be I don't get it

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I don't get it either because if you know someone ends up being creepy or something you delete their friend code or for example with Xbox Live you just befriend them

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Whoa that's

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Or push the button that reports them it's not that hard although I know a lot of people don't use it

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I mean how hard is it I mean people oh no people are gonna send you like stupid messages oh it's so hard to just delete them I mean

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I just don't understand why they have to make extra hoops to jump through for a system that can be so simple

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Rant rant rant rant rant jumpman says historically Nintendo hasn't been great with new technology look at the virtual boy

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Skylark says how do they honestly think friend codes are a good idea if they do anything they prevent us from playing together totally not we

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Making a little play on that play together line get it GS68 says how to meet child molesters come down to the Silicon Valley area and take the line 22 bus after 10pm

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Well here's the thing it's like okay I have a huge list of friends or whatever that you know I've got in my Wii system right now

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I get you know not that I would actually play Pokemon I get Pokemon battle revolution or something like that great I want to play against my friends

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Oh no wait no I can't do that because I have to email all my damn friends now with the Wii system and say hey what's your friend code for Pokemon battle revolution

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Because I can't play you until you know I get this so it may take me a couple days before I'm actually able to play the game online with friends

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Hooray mission accomplished you've really you know embraced online

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Well I think there's only one thing left to say about all of this

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:57.000
That would be the FUs of the week for the second week in a row inspired by Nintendo friend codes

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
No dark soccer tonight so Loki you get first dibs

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000
My FU goes to drama I hate drama and I hate drama that's unnecessary I'll leave it at that for now

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:20.000
My FU goes to bullies they come in all shapes and sizes and fortune 500 sizes and bullies are not cool

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:29.000
And double standards suck as well I really hate double standards I really really really really hate when you see one thing applied this way here

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And then it's applied totally or a blind eye is turned over here I think that's stupid

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
That's all. Rice Princess do you have anything you want to share?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Well I second both of your FUs but yes so FU to immaturity yes that's pretty much it I'm not going to get into specifics yep

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Oh and one last thing some very vague FUs this week FU to the last Mimsy because it just got ridiculous towards the end really ridiculous

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Some chat room folks are entering honorary FUs on behalf of dark sakura for not being here

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Joshi16 says dark sakura FU to fucking drivers drivers suck I hate them they should die in a fire Kingdom Hearts rules no FU to them

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:28.000
That's great oh drunami says FU to e-sluts on myspace yes amen you know I've been gone for 4 days so I logged into myspace I swear to god 15 e-sluts that is going to kill myspace just like slowness killed fredster it really is

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
It would not be that hard for myspace to institute some way to get around that

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I think they kind of are right now

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Well they have that whole thing where you can know my last name and get around it that way so I'm thinking about putting this big thing on my profile that says my last name is roberts

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:51.000
You know because I've used my fake last name that I use on the radio on myspace profile so that people in my real life I don't want to find me can't find me because they don't know my stage name

01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:02.000
So I'm thinking about just putting that really big so that the cam girls are cool and they can't at least shut it off turn it on for a little while and hopefully it will get them to stop hitting my profile I don't know

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Just do what I do robin just not check myspace after you know once every 2 weeks or something because by the time you get back there most of the profiles have been deleted anyways

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I like getting the ads from listeners of the show and things of that you know and people that I you know meet in my real life who I tell how to find my profile and all that stuff

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:33.000
You know I like getting that I don't like having to wait through the cam horse to do it but that's you know there's that all games community site which is pretty rad as well

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Rice Princess you should sign up for that because they talk games on there a lot

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Did you? I don't know well maybe you did it while I've been gone I haven't checked the site in a few days there could have been some great blog posts I don't even know

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I have some game review haikus I have to catch up on for the community site so that's community.allgames.com our buddies over there at all games have set up there their answer to myspace minus the cam horse plus all the gaming chat

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Really? Yes it's good times

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000
But I might have to go there

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
You'll probably get a lot of friend ads because OMG a chick

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Oh ok

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I'm going to go in as a dude

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:18.000
You get a lot of cool people over there it's a good community because all listeners of this show and all games and you know all the other shows that are on allgames.com about the six or seven other indie podcasts they have that are on that network so it's cool

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Yeah I'll check it out

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Good times

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Ok Tigerclaw wants to know if I check the games and porn community site as well apparently all games has these two spin off community sites one of them is rhythm nation which is for like music based games and the other one is games and porn

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I've not looked at games and porn yet but rice princess that sounds right up your alley

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
It totally is

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
You might have to check that out

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Or just the porn

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
So no more news this segment Loki?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
That's it for part A

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Saving the good stuff for part B?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
A little bit yeah

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:03.000
