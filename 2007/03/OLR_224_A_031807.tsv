13817	19799	Tonight, March 18th, 2007, all next-gen systems are set to roll up a beautiful Katamari.
19919	23180	Halo 3 is set to arrive in September, but on what day?
23380	27102	And what happens when two popular dance games get together and have a baby?
32461	37223	Hello everyone out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37263	42806	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42846	43767	My name is Rob Roberts.
43787	44667	You might know me as Sky.
45047	47969	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49045	51447	and also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
51647	51828	Hi.
52328	56131	All right, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, we'd like to welcome you to our little program.
56512	62397	DarkSakura, Loki and I all met a few years ago at an arcade and decided, hey, let's start a radio show talking about games.
62837	65759	And we've been doing this internet program for the past almost five years.
65819	74527	It'll be five years in June talking about, for a while, music-based video games and a couple years ago expanding into podcasting and talking about a general variety of games.
75148	77389	We're going to deviate from our usual form a little bit.
77469	88972	Usually we start off the show talking about how is your gaming week, but tonight we want to get right into this because we think this might be possibly what might draw some new people to our site this week is this particular story.
89012	91073	I'm going to cite a particular story.
91113	95054	This site QJ.net ran this story, so let's take a look, shall we?
96654	97035	Rumor.
97115	100596	Release dates for Beautiful Katamari for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3.
100856	101956	Before we go any further...
102486	108067	We'll take this moment to warn everyone that this particular topic is currently marked with a huge red rumor flag.
108507	117550	This is a report about something that has somehow made the internet implode, but until we get any official word from Namco Bandai about the whole issue, we suggest taking the following details with a grain of salt.
117630	118270	Okay, good.
119310	120030	Blah, blah, blah.
120070	122251	There's reports going around about beautiful Katamari.
122311	122911	Blah, blah, blah.
122931	125191	It's going to come out on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 October 17, 2007 for $39.99.
125251	126452	On the Wii, November 14, 2007 for $29.99.
132619	139340	The report goes on to say that the PlayStation 3 version will feature six acts of support, though fails to elaborate on how exactly this will be implemented.
140201	146522	It also points out that the release dates they gave actually coincide with a trademark Namco and I filed back in January.
146562	148962	A screenshot has said trademark has been provided as proof.
149723	154784	Now, as much as we want to start doing cartwheels of joy over this piece of news, there are several things we need to keep in mind.
155584	158824	At the moment, the only source of these reports seem to be Orange Lounge Radio.
158844	159225	Who are they?
159505	160585	I've never heard of them.
160885	161125	Some...
162018	166180	There's this really annoying guy, and then this other really annoying guy, and then this really awesome girl on it.
166481	168021	A bunch of liars is who they are.
168041	169822	They're a bunch of damn dirty liars.
170783	177106	Although they must have some pretty solid reasons on how they came up with this bit of news, skeptics can say that there are still some gaps that need to be filled in.
177887	183450	We all have yet to receive official word from Namco Bandai, which either confirms or denies the existence of beautiful Katamari.
184130	189593	Trademarks get filed almost every day, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they actually get used.
190514	190974	I don't know, they're
191527	193207	They're really poking some holes in this theory here.
193227	194988	This is something else.
195748	203870	The team behind Katamari has already been disbanded, and as far as everyone knows, no sequels were planned, although Katamari trademarks were registered towards the end of 2006.
206191	211072	Well, we just so happen to have the man who started this whole thing right here in studio tonight, Loki!
211972	212992	You goddamn liar!
213032	215453	Is this some type of April Fool's joke you're playing on all of us?
215693	215893	No.
215913	216513	Is that what it is?
216853	217093	No.
217133	219294	What, next thing you're going to tell me, Knights is coming to the Wii?
219314	219794	What the hell?
222068	222968	That's not my story.
225750	228932	Seriously though, it wasn't just Katamari.
229833	232134	In fact, we have the whole lineup for Namco.
232254	234696	Which we'll be revealing a little later in the show.
234796	236117	So it's not just Katamari.
236417	238298	I got excited about Katamari because I love the game.
238398	241620	So I figured I'd share the story with everyone.
241640	247224	That and I got to jump on those big corporate sites because they like to beat everybody two-stuffed.
248132	252914	Anyways, so, Beautiful Katamari, it is set for this fall.
253554	260237	The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions are set for October 17th, $39.99, which is great.
260317	262217	You know, nice price point for a game like that.
262357	265839	And if you remember, the original Katamari, also very inexpensive.
266339	269680	And then, of course, the Wii version is coming in November, and that's also $29.99.
270580	274842	Now, we do have a big time span between now and the fall, so...
276278	277799	I can confirm this much, okay?
278139	279219	The game is coming out.
279559	280400	That is for sure.
281100	288923	Whether Namco decides to release it on those exact dates, because, you know, dates change a lot, you know, especially with, you know, six months gaps in between them.
289463	292004	I would say that, yeah, it's going to come around the fall for sure.
292565	293925	Those exact dates, who knows?
294005	296286	But those are street dates, not ship dates.
296386	298327	Ship dates are day before, because...
299387	309896	Most retailers out there and most distributors out there, they work on street date systems as opposed to ship dates as most publishers work on.
311057	315441	Let's say that someone's listening to this show for the first time because they want to hear what a bunch of liars we really are.
315981	317643	Why should anyone believe you?
317723	327451	Tell us what happened Friday morning, what took us from you finding out about this and how you found out about it to posting it on the site and so on.
328129	332270	Well, I do a lot of work on order forms and stuff for my company.
332890	355655	I work at a game distributor, one of the big ones in the United States, and so because I work on this show as well, and because I'm a huge freak when it comes to making sure I have accurate dates on all my order forms and stuff, I check our system for new stuff almost twice daily, if not more, because I'm crazy like that.
356640	361083	and so I will look and see if there's new stuff, especially next-gen stuff all the time.
361804	370109	And when I saw, you know, actually I think the first title I did see was Ace Combat 6, which we'll be talking about later.
370489	373431	I saw that and I said, hey, that's kind of neat, new game.
373511	379075	So I, you know, said, okay, we'll probably get some Namco title downloads and
379798	382280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
406135	409737	Any one of our customers has access to this information.
410317	414359	I'm assuming that most of them probably don't work in internet radio as well.
414819	422002	But at the same time, you see this stuff all the time also on GameStop or Amazon or something like that.
422062	423563	They get title downloads as well.
423903	430026	Sometimes GameStop and stuff like that, they'll put in arbitrary titles or dates or whatever for pre-orders.
430066	433268	But since we don't really work on a pre-order system, we don't have anything like that.
433328	433808	We pretty much...
434212	434953	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
458756	459897	and Beautiful Katamari.
460057	468984	And so it was very weird because we don't talk to that site, they don't talk to us, but yet we posted almost very similar stories at the exact same time.
469064	474348	And if you look at their dates on there, their dates are all Friday dates, whereas ours are all Wednesday dates.
474508	476069	Wednesdays are typically when
476513	477273	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
496240	496520	DarkSakura.com
513086	518711	So yeah, that's basically how we come about most of our street dates and stuff like that.
519131	522034	It's from actual sources at these companies.
522074	526638	The problem is, though, their marketing departments and the sales departments don't always talk to each other.
527018	537027	So in the case of Konami last year, when we released all the information about their E3 lineup, they apparently didn't really want that information to be leaked out.
537447	540250	But unfortunately, somebody in their sales department went and did that.
540816	541416	and so on.
563462	566903	This news, you know, the dates could change, the prices could change.
566923	575346	A lot of websites who've been blogging about this have been kind of saying that, wow, this is really ballsy of them to post some dates and some dollar amounts when it's so far out of advance.
575686	578247	But you're kind of admitting that that could change.
578787	580588	If it changes, it won't be by much.
580728	589291	I mean, usually, you know, Namco, as far as I'm familiar with, they don't really change dates too much as far as stuff releasing.
589331	591632	You know, some companies, for example, some of the smaller ones,
592312	592873	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
610100	610721	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
628641	635923	Up to the company, but I don't really kind of... If that were the case and if I was always afraid of dates changing, then I'd never be telling you guys news.
636023	641385	But the reason is, even if the date changes, that's whatever.
642045	644566	But the fact is, this game is coming out.
645406	655529	Next question I'm going to ask you, and I think of... Let's think of some cases on this program where this was correct, and you named games through the distribution system people didn't have yet that ended up coming out.
655569	658250	We may not have blogged about them on the site, because we don't have the resources...
658618	663941	to have people crawling blog sites 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and the distribution thing and the way the other sites do it.
664421	665922	We have day jobs.
665982	667503	We do this for fun in the evening.
668063	669704	Like Loki said, his day job is distribution.
671521	675902	We don't have the resources to blog about it and have it in writing that we were the first every time.
676302	684544	And the fact is, sometimes, like I said, the marketing departments and sales departments of these companies don't always work together.
685004	685825	Some of them do.
685965	690006	Like, for example, Nintendo, they know not to say anything about anything.
690066	692746	And even when you feed them a lot of alcohol, they still will not say anything.
692766	699028	But yet, I seem to recall that you were the only one that was willing to say that the Wii was going to come out after the PlayStation 3.
699844	703551	Because at some point earlier in the year, Nintendo had said, no, we're going to beat the PlayStation 3.
704071	704572	And they didn't.
704793	705093	Remember?
705133	706295	The Wii came out a little bit later.
706436	707157	And you called that.
707197	708239	I remember that distinctly.
709056	711798	Not that I'm trying to inflate our ego here.
711838	713139	It's not a big deal, honestly.
713619	715581	But, I don't know.
715621	721165	For me, I get a little bit frustrated when I see all these website headlines that say, Rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor.
721625	727829	Yet, when EB Games and GameStop will post dates, they'll block it with, EB Games says this is going to come out.
727869	728910	And they don't say it's a rumor.
729190	732853	Why couldn't this have been blocked saying, Distribution leak says blah, blah, blah.
732873	734314	Why does that have to be rumor, rumor, rumor?
734554	740647	Well, it's because, you know, our website doesn't have the word game in it or a company name like Nintendo or something like that.
740948	741730	And that's why.
742231	743233	For example, though, I mean...
743712	745274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
766155	768496	Then everybody forgets that we even mentioned anything.
768776	770456	And this is how it's happened in the past.
770737	772437	I mean, full out of two on the PSP.
772597	775698	I kept saying this weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks after each other.
776058	781740	But no one remembered when, you know, was it 1UP ran the fucking press release or ran the story that's coming out.
781760	784221	I was like, oh, look, it's coming out on the PSP now.
784241	785581	I'm like, yeah, I've been saying it for months.
785621	788002	The other one I think of is Oblivion on the PSP.
788022	790463	Because when you first said that on the show, I was like...
791127	792528	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
