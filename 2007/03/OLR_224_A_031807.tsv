0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	12000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco
14000	16000	Tonight, March 18th, 2007
16000	18000	All next-gen systems are set to roll up
18000	20000	A beautiful Katamari
20000	22000	Halo 3 is set to arrive in September
22000	23000	But on what day?
23000	27000	And what happens when two popular dance games get together and have a baby?
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	34000	Hello everyone out there on the internet
34000	37000	And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
37000	40000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games
40000	43000	Video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle
43000	45000	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky
45000	48000	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
48000	49000	Yo
49000	51000	And also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki
51000	52000	Hi
52000	54000	Alright, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio
54000	56000	We'd like to welcome you to our little program
56000	59000	DarkSakura, Loki and I all met a few years ago at an arcade
59000	62000	And decided, hey let's start a radio show talking about games
62000	65000	And we've been doing this internet program for the past almost five years
65000	67000	It'll be five years in June
67000	69000	Talking about for a while music-based video games
69000	71000	And a couple years ago expanding into podcasting
71000	74000	And talking about a general variety of games
74000	77000	We're going to deviate from our usual forum a little bit
77000	80000	Usually we start off the show talking about how is your gaming week
80000	82000	But tonight, we want to get right into this
82000	87000	Because we think this might be possibly what might draw some new people to our site this week
87000	89000	Is this particular story
89000	92000	I'm going to cite a particular story of this site
92000	94000	QJ.net ran this story
94000	96000	So let's take a look, shall we?
96000	101000	Rumor, release dates for beautiful Katamari for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3
101000	104000	Before we go any further, we'll take this moment to warn everyone
104000	108000	That this particular topic is currently marked with a huge red rumor flag
108000	112000	This is a report about something that has somehow made the internet implode
112000	115000	But until we get any official word from Namco Bandai about the whole issue
115000	117000	We suggest taking the following details with a grain of salt
117000	119000	Okay, good
119000	122000	Blah, blah, blah, there's reports going around about beautiful Katamari
122000	125000	Blah, blah, blah, it's going to come out on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
125000	128000	October 17, 2007 for $39.99
128000	132000	On the Wii, November 14, 2007 for $29.99
132000	136000	The report goes on to say that the PlayStation 3 version will feature 6-axis support
136000	139000	Though fails to elaborate on how exactly this will be implemented
139000	143000	And also points out that the release dates they gave actually coincide with a trademark
143000	146000	Namco Bandai filed back in January
146000	149000	A screenshot has said trademark has been provided as proof
149000	153000	Now as much as we want to start doing cartwheels of joy over this piece of news
153000	155000	There are several things we need to keep in mind
155000	159000	At the moment, the only source of these reports seem to be Orange Lounge Radio
159000	161000	Who are they? I've never heard of them
161000	166000	There's this really annoying guy and then this other really annoying guy and then this really awesome girl on it
166000	170000	A bunch of liars is who they are, they're a bunch of damn dirty liars
170000	174000	Although they must have some pretty solid reasons on how they came up with this bit of news
174000	177000	Skeptics can say that there are still some gaps that need to be filled in
177000	180000	We all have yet to receive official word from Namco Bandai
180000	183000	Which either confirms or denies the existence of beautiful Katamari
183000	186000	Trademarks get filed almost every day
186000	189000	But that doesn't necessarily mean that they actually get used
189000	193000	I don't know, they're really poking some holes in this theory here
193000	195000	This is something else
195000	198000	The team behind Katamari has already been disbanded
198000	200000	And as far as everyone knows, no sequels were planned
200000	205000	Although Katamari trademarks were registered towards the end of 2006
205000	210000	Well we just so happen to have the man who started this whole thing right here in studio tonight
210000	213000	Loki, you goddamn liar
213000	215000	Is this some type of April Fools joke you're playing on all of us?
215000	216000	No
216000	217000	Is that what it is?
217000	218000	No
218000	220000	Tell me Knights is coming to the Wii? What the hell?
220000	223000	That's not my story
223000	225000	Alright, no
225000	229000	Seriously though, it wasn't just Katamari
229000	232000	In fact, we have the whole lineup for Namco
232000	234000	Which we'll be revealing a little later in the show
234000	236000	So it's not just Katamari
236000	238000	I got excited by Katamari because I love the game
238000	241000	So I figured, share the story with everyone
241000	244000	That and I gotta get a jump on those big corporate sites
244000	247000	Because, you know, they like to beat everybody to stuff
247000	249000	Anyways, so
249000	251000	Beautiful Katamari
251000	253000	It is set for this fall
253000	256000	The Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions
256000	258000	Are set for October 17th
258000	260000	$39.99, which is great
260000	262000	You know, nice price point for a game like that
262000	264000	And if you remember, the original Katamari
264000	266000	Also very inexpensive
266000	269000	And then of course the Wii version is coming in November
269000	271000	And that's also $29.99
271000	274000	Now, we do have a big time span between now and the fall
274000	277000	So, I can confirm this much
277000	279000	Okay, the game is coming out
279000	281000	That is for sure
281000	283000	Whether Namco decides to release it on those exact dates
283000	286000	Because, you know, dates change a lot
286000	289000	You know, especially with six months gaps in between them
289000	292000	I would say that yeah, it's gonna come around the fall for sure
292000	294000	Those exact dates, who knows
294000	296000	But those are street dates, not ship dates
296000	298000	Ship dates are a day before
298000	301000	Because, you know, most retailers out there
301000	303000	And most distributors out there
303000	305000	They work on street date systems
305000	307000	As opposed to ship dates
307000	309000	As, you know, most publishers work on
309000	311000	So
311000	313000	Let's say that someone's listening to this show for the first time
313000	315000	Because they want to hear what a bunch of liars we really are
315000	317000	Why should anyone believe you?
317000	319000	Tell me, tell us
319000	322000	How you got, tell us what happened Friday morning
322000	324000	What took us from you finding out about this
324000	326000	And how you found out about it too
326000	328000	Posting it on the site and so on
328000	332000	Well, I do a lot of work on order forms and stuff for my company
332000	335000	I'm a, you know, I work at a game distributor
335000	338000	One of the big ones in the United States
338000	342000	And so, because I work on this show as well
342000	344000	And because I'm, you know, a huge freak
344000	346000	When it comes to making sure I have accurate dates
346000	348000	And all my, you know, order forms and stuff
348000	351000	I check our system for new stuff
351000	354000	Almost twice daily, if not more
354000	356000	Because I'm crazy like that
356000	359000	And so, I will look and see if there's new stuff
359000	362000	Especially next gen stuff all the time
362000	364000	And when I saw, you know
364000	367000	Actually, I think the first title I did see was
367000	369000	Ace Combat 6
369000	370000	Which we'll be talking about later
370000	371000	I saw that and the system was like
371000	373000	Hey, that's kind of neat, new game
373000	375000	So I, you know, said
375000	378000	Okay, well probably got some Namco title downloads
378000	380000	And sure enough, pulled up
380000	382000	Oh, there's Katamari
382000	384000	So I was like, okay, I gotta let people know this
384000	386000	Because I was literally like jumping up and down in my seat
386000	387000	You know, when I saw this
387000	390000	But anyways, as far as how I get these dates
390000	394000	These dates are actually straight from the publishers
394000	397000	Usually their sales department, purchasing department
397000	398000	Wherever you may call it
398000	399000	Are they secret?
399000	401000	Are you breaking an NDA by posting these?
401000	402000	Can you get fired?
402000	403000	Can we get sued?
403000	404000	No, no, there's no
404000	406000	This is public information
406000	408000	Any one of our, you know, customers
408000	410000	Has access to this information
410000	412000	I'm assuming that most of them probably
412000	414000	Don't, you know, work in internet radio as well
414000	418000	But at the same time, I mean, you see this stuff all the time
418000	421000	Also on like, you know, GameStop or Amazon
421000	422000	Or something like that
422000	423000	They get title downloads as well
423000	426000	Sometimes, you know, GameStop and stuff like that
426000	428000	They'll put in arbitrary, you know, titles or dates
428000	430000	Or whatever, you know, for preorders
430000	432000	But since we don't really work on a preorder system
432000	433000	We don't have anything like that
433000	435000	We pretty much, if they give us, you know, the information
435000	436000	To set up an item
436000	438000	We will set it up in our system
438000	440000	And with whatever information they give us
440000	442000	Well, interestingly enough
442000	445000	One thing that we observed is that almost at the same time
445000	447000	And I don't know who posted it first
447000	449000	You, these guys, but this other site
449000	454000	Xbox IC had some guy renegade with a cell phone camera
454000	457000	At a blockbuster who took screenshots in their system
457000	460000	Also of Ace Combat and beautiful Katamari
460000	463000	And so it was very weird because, you know, we don't talk to that site
463000	464000	They don't talk to us
464000	468000	But yet we posted almost very similar stories
468000	469000	At the exact same time
469000	470000	It's very interesting
470000	471000	And if you look at their dates on there
471000	473000	Their dates are all Friday dates
473000	474000	Whereas ours are all Wednesday dates
474000	479000	Wednesdays are typically when, you know, most companies get their games released
479000	481000	Of course games come out every single day of the week
481000	485000	But for the most part it's usually Wednesdays, Thursdays or Tuesdays
485000	486000	Usually in the middle of the week
486000	489000	Now blockbusters, they're one of two things
489000	492000	They're either gonna, most likely they're gonna be
492000	494000	Not direct with a publisher
494000	496000	So for Blockbuster
496000	499000	They would be getting their product received into the distributor
499000	501000	Or their corporate office or wherever
501000	502000	And shipped out to the store
502000	504000	Usually about two days ground or whatnot
504000	507000	That's why they have Friday street dates in there instead of Wednesdays
507000	510000	It just, you know, makes the system nice and neat and stuff
510000	513000	So, yeah
513000	519000	That's basically how we come about most of our street, you know, street dates and stuff like that
519000	522000	It's from actual sources at these companies
522000	524000	The problem is though their marketing departments
524000	527000	And the sales departments don't always talk to each other
527000	530000	And so in the case of like, you know, Konami last year
530000	533000	When we released all the information about their E3 lineup
533000	537000	They apparently didn't really want that information to be, you know, leaked out
537000	541000	But unfortunately somebody in their sales department went and did that
541000	543000	But, you know, that's life
543000	545000	That was a very interesting thing
545000	547000	Because, you know, we have friends that work at Konami
547000	548000	Several friends work at Konami
548000	550000	And they almost got a little heat
550000	552000	Because Konami thought they blapped
552000	554000	And that isn't the case
554000	556000	It was this whole roundabout thing that went on
556000	558000	Which was very interesting last year when that all went down
558000	560000	Yeah
560000	566000	Now you say that this news, you know, the dates could change
566000	567000	The prices could change
567000	569000	And a lot of websites who've been blocking about this
569000	570000	Have been kind of saying that
570000	574000	Wow, this is really ballsy of them to post some dates and some dollar amounts
574000	576000	When it's so far out of advance
576000	578000	But you're kind of admitting that that could change
578000	581000	If it changes, it won't be by much
581000	585000	I mean, usually, you know, Namco as far as I'm familiar with
585000	587000	They don't really change dates too much
587000	589000	As far as stuff releasing
589000	592000	You know, some companies, for example, some of the smaller ones
592000	594000	You know, there's titles they'll move each month
594000	597000	And, you know, we'll see a date change like six or seven times
597000	599000	You know, some companies are a little bit better by that
599000	601000	When they put a street date in the system
601000	603000	They'll actually stick to that
603000	607000	You know, Rockstar with Grand Theft Auto IV
607000	611000	That's been October 17th since it's been announced
611000	613000	But I think about Bethesda and Oblivion
613000	615000	And that date always falls back
615000	616000	Yeah, exactly
616000	618000	And it can be, you know, a couple things
618000	622000	They can be trying to postpone it to a later date because it's not done
622000	627000	Or because they want to time it with, you know, certain releases or lack of releases
627000	629000	You know, it's really up to the company
629000	631000	But I, you know, I don't really kind of
631000	634000	If that were the case and if I was always afraid of dates changing
634000	636000	Then I'd never be telling you guys news
636000	640000	But the reason is you, I mean, even if the date changes
640000	642000	That's, you know, whatever
642000	645000	But the fact is this game is coming out
645000	646000	Next question I'm going to ask you
646000	647000	Yeah, and I think of
647000	651000	Let's think of some cases on this program where this was correct
651000	653000	And you named games through the distribution system
653000	655000	People didn't have yet that ended up coming out
655000	657000	We may not have blogged about them on the site
657000	659000	Because we don't have the resources to have people
659000	661000	Crawling blog sites 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
661000	664000	And the distribution thing and the way the other sites do it
664000	666000	We don't, we have day jobs
666000	668000	We do this for fun in the evening, you know
668000	670000	Like Logie said, his day job is distribution
670000	673000	So we don't have the resources to blog about it
673000	676000	And have it, you know, in writing that we were the first every time
676000	680000	And the fact is sometimes, you know, like I said
680000	683000	The marketing departments and sales departments of these companies
683000	685000	Don't always work together
685000	687000	Some of them do, like for example Nintendo
687000	690000	They know not to say anything about anything
690000	692000	And even when you feed them a lot of alcohol
692000	693000	They still will not say anything
693000	696000	But yet I seem to recall that you were the only one
696000	698000	That was willing to say that the Wii was going to come out
698000	700000	After the PlayStation 3
700000	702000	Because at some point earlier in the year
702000	704000	Nintendo had said, no, we're going to beat the PlayStation 3
704000	706000	And they didn't, remember the Wii came out a little bit later
706000	708000	And you called that, I remember that distinctly
708000	711000	Not that I'm trying to inflate our own ego here
711000	713000	You know, it's not a big deal, honestly
713000	715000	But it just, I don't know
715000	719000	For me, I get a little bit frustrated when I see all these website headlines
719000	721000	And say, rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor
721000	724000	Yet when EB Games and GameStop will post dates
724000	727000	They'll block it with, EB Games says this is going to come out
727000	729000	And they don't say it's a rumor
729000	732000	Why couldn't this have been blocked saying, distribution leak says, blah, blah, blah
732000	734000	Why does that have to be rumor, rumor, rumor?
734000	737000	Well it's because, you know, our website doesn't have the word game
737000	740000	In it or a company name like Nintendo or something like that
740000	742000	And that's why
742000	746000	For example though, I mean, look at the Konami releases and stuff
746000	750000	Or for example, I think someone, I can't remember if you did this or not in the story
750000	754000	But the whole Wired article saying, Karaoke Revolution, American Idol
754000	756000	All these guys are a bunch of liars
756000	758000	And this thing is never coming out
758000	759000	And then it comes out
759000	761000	Do we see, you know, a story run later?
761000	762000	Oh, they were right, no
762000	764000	Everybody forgets that we mentioned it
764000	766000	And once, you know, a big site runs the press release
