00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, March 4th, 2007, drama ensues over Sony's rumored PlayStation Home.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
We talk about who is starting an anti-weed campaign.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
The popular new computer game is rumored to be making a jump to Xbox Live.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, on their iPods, their Zens, whatever devices you're using to listen to us.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
Maybe your Xbox 360, thanks to the 360 cast or whatever that thing was called.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
We are a show dedicated to video games and gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Yo.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
How you doing, Miss Jamie Summers?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Ow.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Ow? What's wrong? Your head hurt?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
No.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
What?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Female ow.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh, I see. The TMI type of ow, huh?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yes.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Sorry to hear it. Well, I'm sure we'll have some extra special eff you use tonight.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yes.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
But overall, a good weekend. Jamie and I had a play day yesterday in San Francisco. That was fun.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
It was pretty fun. And we both have really hot hair now.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Yes, we got our hair done. That's the first time I've ever paid $45 for a haircut.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
But it looks nice.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
Be glad. You know how much I pay for mine.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Isn't that a sexist thing?

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
I have more hair, and I have more shit done to my hair.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
What if I was a dude with long hair?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
They'd probably charge you more.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
You think?

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Not that I would ever have long hair, but I've seen guys with longer hair than a lot of women I know.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Well, like Marissa's boyfriend.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Oh, that's true. Yeah.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
He's got gorgeous, gorgeous supermodel hair.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
If I remember right, I think he chopped it off at one point.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
But remember Blue from DER Freak, who's really into pump it up? Didn't he have kind of long hair?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
He almost had it in a ponytail, didn't he?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Yeah, he had really, really long hair.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes, that's who I kind of think of. I remember him.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Anyway, say hello as well.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
Before we talk about people who aren't here to defend themselves too much, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Yes, I'm here.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
How you doing, Loki?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
I'm doing good.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Great.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
I see you have not one, but two PSPs up and running with Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Are you playing against yourself tonight? What is going on here?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Yeah, I was just testing stuff.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
He's playing with himself on my radio.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Fun. What types of things are you testing out?

02:32.000 --> 02:41.000
Just Dark Alex's custom firmware, because it allowed me to run PS1 games on it.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Wow, that's like three weeks in a row, four weeks in a row?

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
I think that that's fantastic, because right when you made that little announcement, we have the doom and gloom music stuff.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
No, actually that reminds me...

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
I should just do that every week, because I never forget to...

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
Just so you know what goes on behind the scenes, obviously we have a playlist set up with all the music that we're going to use, the incidental music during the show already set up.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
And I'm supposed to hit stop before the next song comes on, because we put little breaks in the playlist, but sometimes I forget to hit stop.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Anyways...

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Such as I've done for the past three weeks.

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
I've got a nice firmware that I got. I've got a nice 2GIG memory stick so I can put PlayStation 1 games on there.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
So that's kind of what I was doing, because I have this other PlayStation, or PSP, and I'm like, well what the hell am I going to do with this thing?

03:23.000 --> 03:30.000
So load up a custom firmware and I can make it all pretty, because you can edit all the icons, you can edit the waves in the background, everything.

03:30.000 --> 03:40.000
And you run homebrew off of a memory stick, plus you can run programs that require firmware 310, or 303 I guess.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And so it's like the best of both worlds.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Alright.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Also joining us tonight, we don't have any other guests in studio, that's a first.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
We haven't had that in a long time, so it's going to be a relatively quiet show tonight, I don't know.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
We'll see.

03:55.000 --> 04:01.000
The three of us will entertain you the best we can, but of course we always have our invisible other guests with us every week.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
The chat room, and that's accessible over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
XBStream, that's the name of the Xbox 360 program I was trying to think of at the beginning.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
You can listen to us on XBStream, we're one of the default podcasts.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I forgot about that.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Thank you to the XBStream folks, and don't be too mad at me for forgetting your name.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Let's see, looking at the chat room there.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
AlphaKennogram says, the soundboard is cursed!

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
We don't really use a soundboard, it's just Winamp, nothing too fancy.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
It's Rob.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
It's my fault.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
Actually if I did switch to a soundboard it would probably be easier, but I don't like the whole soundboard setup thing.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
Plus I feel like if I had a soundboard, I would use it far too much.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
Not to say there's other shows out there that do use it too much, but I'm just thinking that we probably use it too much.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Blaze says that three weeks in a row they've effed up the soundboard.

04:53.000 --> 04:59.000
I didn't eff up anything, I was sitting here in my chair, sitting here.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Alright, let's see, Damony says I got Crash Bandicoot on my PSP.

05:04.000 --> 05:12.000
Remember when Crash Bandicoot was cool before it went the way of Spyro and all those other franchises, they just drove into the ground?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
No, I never remember it being cool.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
It was cool at one point.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Crash Bandicoot 2 was the first PlayStation game I ever owned.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I never remember that game being cool.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Well, whatever.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Let's see, what else is here?

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Fireboma says, anyway, anyone here play Magic?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Like the Gathering?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Haven't since I was in college the first time around.

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
Dude, I sold my deck when I was a junior in high school, which was a long time ago, over ten years ago if you can believe it.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
And it's still going strong.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I remember the old computer game.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Not the one you could play online, but the very first computer game that ever came out.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I really liked that.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
I remember you walked around a map and battled other people.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I should try and find that and play it again.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
It was kind of fun, but I don't think they really make it anymore because didn't they go online with it?

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
And then they tried to sell expansion cards online?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
They tried to take the whole thing online?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
I still don't remember that.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I don't remember.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Let's see.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
SSJ100 Matt says, I remember the old Crash commercials where he would always cause trouble outside of Nintendo.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
I remember that as well.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
That's pretty cool.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Let's see.

06:15.000 --> 06:23.000
Also, RK1hexAugust31st wants to know, what about the part where you call out the noobs?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Well, all right.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
We can do that.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
The noobs in chat tonight.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Of course, again, I'm going off memory.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Dark Soccer, you may have to help me if you don't recognize any of these names.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I think, well, first off, that name I just named is new.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
RK1hexAugust31.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Let's see.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Broodwitch I think is new.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Alistar I recognize from our World of Warcraft guild.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Hello.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Let's see.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Who else is new?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I don't know if I recognize any other new names.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Jodrew?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Have we had that before?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
I might be new too.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
So there you have it.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Hello, noobs.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Everybody who's new.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
The ones that I neglected to name and the ones that I may have named twice.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
There you go.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Hi, monsters.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
All right.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Wait.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Anyhow.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I just had it in my head because I just typed die, monster.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I meant hi, noobs.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
All right.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Is there a Castlevania chat going on?

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Someone said Rondo of Blood sucks, so I kicked whoever that was.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
All right.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
You're a big fan of Castlevania, obviously.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Symphony of the Night included.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
No.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I like Metroid.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Look, I know you're really, well, then you should really like Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
I know.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Because it ripped off Metroid in many ways, but that's what made it so great.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I'm going to kick DM in too, just because.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Okay, do it.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
What was I going to say?

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Rondo of Blood you love, but Symphony of the Night was kind of in some ways a sequel to Rondo of Blood.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
You love Symphony of the Night a lot, right?

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Yeah, that was a sequel to Rondo of Blood.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Right.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
Are you going to play it on Xbox Live Arcade, or are you going to say, eh, why should I download this?

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
I already have the PlayStation and Saturn and whatever else.

07:50.000 --> 07:57.000
Saturn and I don't really have a need to, because I do have the other versions, so.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Although, to this one's credit, it'll be, you know.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
If it's the Saturn version, hell yeah.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
No, it won't be.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Then no.

08:04.000 --> 08:13.000
It'll be enabled for your HDTV, granted it's got the stupid stagnant graphics on the side, but at least you won't have to worry about altering your TV settings or any of that stuff.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
You can get messages from a lot of our listeners while you play.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Then no.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
When I was playing DDR Universe this week, I got like 50.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
I don't want messages arriving while I'm in the middle of the game.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
You don't have to answer them.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I don't like seeing little things pop up on the middle of the game.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
You can also ignore them.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
You can turn that off.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I'm lazy.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
I've been playing my PS3 today.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Well, that's your fault.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
All right, well then let's get into how was your gaming week, because we always start off with a show with how was your gaming week.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
So what have you been playing this week, Dark Sakura?

08:37.000 --> 08:46.000
I played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance today on PS3, which was really, really good.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
And we just got a new pinball machine.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
I've got a bride of Pinbot now.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
We're working on fixing it up, and that's really it.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I thought you said you played Marvel this week.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
That's what I just said.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
I played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance today.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Well, tell me more about it.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
What's the game like?

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
It actually is a really good game.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
It's surprising, although the PS3 version, it obviously is just a port, because nothing is pretty or super.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Well, I mean, it's really pretty.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
The gameplay itself, but the cinemas are not touched up for it.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
But the only complaint I really have with that game is the camera sometimes getting a little bit weird,

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
and the bosses in the Atlantis level right now.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
But it was really cool, because, like, dude, what the hell is Mysterio doing here?

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
And, like, I've determined that playing as Elektra sucks, but playing as Captain America is fucking awesome,

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
because he throws the shield and it bounces off the walls while you beat other stuff up,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
and then, like, right when they're about to hit you, it bounces them in the head.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
I seem to remember it was kind of that way in an old arcade game.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
Didn't they have an old arcade Marvel game that you could play that was very similar?

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
Yeah, there was the Avengers game that was, you know, just one of those little side-scrolling basher things.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I seem to remember a shield kind of did the same thing, where it bounced around.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Dude, Captain America is awesome.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
That's cool.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I have a mild obsession with Captain America right now.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
And yes, as a SH-100, Matt and his Marvel does rock,

10:03.000 --> 10:09.000
except I've decided that who rocks more than she does in that game is Spider-Woman.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
For those that maybe don't follow comic books as heavily as you do,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
because I know you're a bit of a comic fangirl,

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
but maybe, you know, I like the X-Men movie, I like the cartoons,

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
I know I'm somewhat familiar with the Marvel universe, but I don't really follow it.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
So would there be anything for me in this game, or would I not appreciate it because I don't really follow Marvel?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
I don't think you have to really follow it.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
I mean, there's so much fun fan stuff thrown in that I think it's really great,

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
but I don't think you really need to be a big fan of, you know, Marvel comics to get into the game.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
It does follow the established Marvel universe, although for some weird reason.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Like, a couple of the characters are in their Ultimate costumes,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
but, like, I quickly went and changed all of them back to their regular universe ones,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
but it was pretty cool.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
That has Nick Fury in it, and he's awesome.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
But not like the Ultimate version, where he's like Sammy L. Pimp, you know, Nick Fury,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
it's like old-school eyepatch Nick Fury, which makes me happy.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
And no, wait, I cannot believe you're betraying me like this.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
It's our friend Brad from Pod Culture.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
No, I don't like DC Comics.

11:11.000 --> 11:18.000
Except for I like Birds of Prey, because it's very, you know, ambiguously lesbian-ish.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Wait, DC Comics is...

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Superman.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Batman, too, right?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
And Batman.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
I love the X-Men, and I love the Avengers, except for Iron Man, because he's an asshole right now.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
But I really like Captain America.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
All right, let's see, I'm looking at the chat room to see some other comics here.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Some folks in there are explaining their gaming week.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
Of course, I see Brad saying the DC universe beats Marvel every day.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Uh-oh.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
What else is there?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Sounds like a lot of people playing Crackdown this week.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Somebody had said, I was looking, there it is.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
Tiger Claw says, I remember the X-Men arcade game with the widescreen and the four players.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
And that was the game that first came into my mind.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
Although, obviously, Captain America wasn't in that game,

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
but I also remember that game very well from the arcades.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
Like, it was one of those things where they put two TVs together to make the screen,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
and it had the big line going down the middle because it was two monitors next to each other.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
But that game was fun.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
And it wasn't just four, couldn't you play that with six people?

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
I seem to remember, like, there was a mondo-sized version.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Six or eight.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
The Golf Land had a one-point. You could play, like, six people.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Of course, if you were player one or player six, it sucked to be you,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
because you were, like, standing on the side.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
You could kind of only half see the screen.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Because they have, like, three monitors or whatever, and it's kind of wrapped around.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Yeah, that was a funny game.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
It's like, I walked off the screen. Aw.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
All right, I'm assuming Dark Soccer has done, so, Loki, how was your gaming week?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
It was fun.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I played Crackdown a lot.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
I actually finished the game, but I'm getting those last few achievements.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
Like, I have everything maxed out except for firearms now, so I just have to max that out.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I'm already at level four on it, but just, you know, almost there.

12:55.000 --> 13:00.000
And then I have to get the rest of the orbs and the hidden orbs and all that stuff.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
So I'm just working on the last few achievements, but I'm done with the game, so, yay.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
And then, what else?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Oh, I played DDR Universe, and that was okay.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
It's good for DDR, I guess, but I got really uninterested, you know, after a while.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
It took forever to unlock stuff, and it's kind of just, eh, don't care.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
I really hate Quest Mode. I think it's retarded.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And, yeah, the Challenge Mode is kind of cool.

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
I really wish it was stuck with, like, the Interstellar Mode or whatever they had before in, like, Extreme 2 and stuff.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
That was, Stellar Master Mode. That was a lot better than this crappy-ass Quest Mode.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
It just has not gotten any better.

13:42.000 --> 13:49.000
Bullet Witch. I played Bullet Witch a little bit, and everything bad that you've heard about that game is true.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
It sucks balls.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
It's really that bad. What exactly do you do in Bullet Witch? I've seen it, but I don't know much about it.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Bullet Witch, you just go around killing things, but the thing that sucks about it...

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
I like murder.

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
Okay, well, murder is good, but the game itself, there's no lock-on for anything, and the enemies are really fucking easy.

14:06.000 --> 14:13.000
But then again, like I said, to be fair, I've only played it for a short amount of time, so I haven't really given it a fair shake yet,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
but from what I've seen so far, it doesn't look good.

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
It looks like a game that was, like, first-gen PlayStation 2 or something, just really old.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
I don't know. It just didn't feel very cool or anything, but, you know, whatever.

14:27.000 --> 14:34.000
So I gave it a shot, and then I played the Armored Core 4 demo that's out in Japan right now,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
and that one is awesome, and I can't wait to pick up the full game.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
It's a lot faster than ChromeHounds.

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
If you were turned off by ChromeHounds, this might be the game for you, because it's a lot faster.

14:44.000 --> 14:49.000
I mean, there's three fucking buttons for, you know, boost in the game, so, I mean, you gotta love that.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
And it's just pretty cool. I like it.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.000
Although it was in Japanese, so I didn't really know what they wanted me to do, but it was fun blowing up things.

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
So I'm really looking forward to that, and I think that's pretty much all I played this week.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.000
Yeah, lots of Crackdown, though. I really need to play some co-op so I can get that last co-op achievement.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
But, oh, there's some fun things to do in Crackdown. We were messing around with stuff.

15:17.000 --> 15:25.000
Driving the semi-truck around and just boosting through pedestrians like crazy was fun.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Killing hundreds and hundreds of people.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
And you can actually level up your driving pretty fast that way, because you end up killing more bad guys than you do the actual pedestrians.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
I don't know. It was fun.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
Alright. I also played a little bit of Crackdown this week, but not enough to really review the game.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
And it's odd, because I don't really get into those types of games like Crackdown or Grand Theft Auto.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
I mean, they're kind of fun for five minutes, but when I try to play the story mode, I don't really get into them as much.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
So I can't really give the game a fair review yet, but I'm going to force myself to play a little more and try to look at it a little more from the perspective of,

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
well, okay, I realize I'm not a fan of this genre, but what my fans of the genre think of it.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
But I'm more excited about getting to play the Halo 3 beta, finally, after all.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
So I'm looking forward to that as part of Crackdown.

16:07.000 --> 16:17.000
Also, games I did play a little more that I did get into this week. Missed Online, I finally checked out, which obviously existed a few years ago,

16:17.000 --> 16:22.000
but kind of got the plug pulled on it before it really had a chance to be a flourished game.

16:22.000 --> 16:30.000
So GameTap gave this thing CPR recently, and now it's up and running as of, I think, Valentine's Day or the day after is when they actually launched this.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
So I went on there to check it out, very much unlike any other MMO you've ever played.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
In fact, I don't even know if it would be fair to call this game an MMO,

16:39.000 --> 16:46.000
because if you think this is going to be like a Warcraft-y run quest, slash things, kill things, that's totally not like that.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
You've got to remember, Missed was not like that. Missed was what?

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
It was a puzzle game where you didn't really know what the hell was going on.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
You just knew you had to do things to unlock the way, and as you explored, you figured out more of the story.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
So that's exactly what Missed Online is. It's a game of exploration with other people.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
It's kind of weird at first because my brain wasn't really thinking that was what I was getting into,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
although I should have known better because I played Missed back in the day.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
But I'm thinking, oh, it's an MMO. We're going to go around and kill things.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
No, no, no, no, no. It's nothing like that.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
So the game itself controls a little weird and is a little jumpy.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
I don't know if I dug the control scheme, but it's very simple.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
It's a very easy game to kind of jump into.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Things I liked about the game.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
I think the game is relatively good looking, especially when you consider the game is a couple years old.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
I think the game also, as I said, is easy to really pick up and go.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
I think it's got a very interesting story, and I really like the ambiance

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
because in many ways it felt like it was Silent Hill just with no zombies.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
There was a part that actually scared me is that I was walking onto a bridge,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
and suddenly the bridge collapsed, and I was like, ah!

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
But that just kind of shows how you can really get sucked into this game

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
because the acronym URU also stands for U-R-U.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
So you're supposed to kind of envision that it's actually you in the world.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
So the music and everything kind of adds this ambiance to it that I really liked.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Things I didn't like about the game.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
Download times are atrocious.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
I mean, having to patch the game earlier in the week,

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
there was no percentage bar or anything that showed me how long it was.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I swear the game took like an hour to patch.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Additionally, when you try to access new areas in game,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
it takes a long time to load up the new areas of the game

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
because sometimes it's like you're downloading them before you even go there.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
I understand it's trying to download the world on my computer,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
but I kind of wish there was a little more forewarning or something.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
I literally had to wait 30 minutes for some new area to download,

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
and I just bounced from spending only five minutes in another place.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
I was just kind of exploring, walking around, and then suddenly, bam,

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
I got to wait 30 minutes with no real warning.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
So the load times in the game I was not a fan of.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
I do think, though, back to the positives,

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
I think if you're the type of person to get sucked into those reality gaming things,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
what do they call those things?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Like the Loki or the alternate universe games?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
ARGs? What is that?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Alternate reality gaming ARGs.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
What are some of the popular ones?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I don't remember.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
They have one right now for...

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
It's not really an alternate reality game.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I guess it's more of a viral site or something,

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
but sort of is.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
What was it?

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
premiumtechpaper.com or something like that?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Okay, well, Myst is kind of something like that,

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
but it takes you to the next level.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Actually, that might be more of a viral site.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Myst Online really takes us to the next level,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
because there are sites that are supposedly made by people in the cavern.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
I think if you're into role-playing a little bit, you'd really be into it,

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
because there's people that play IC in cavern.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
They pretend that they really are in the cavern,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
and they really are exploring these worlds and talk with that perspective.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
There's people that play OOC at a cavern and talk like it's normal.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
The Myst Online guides give you this general overview of what to expect.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
I think it's really cool that GameTap is really pouring their heart and soul into this game.

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
I'm very encouraged to see what kind of next MMO they jump onto next,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
because it's obviously putting a lot of effort into Myst.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Oh, one other thing I should say about Myst.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
There are live people that interact with the game as well,

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
and continue to develop the story.

20:26.000 --> 20:32.000
Essentially, the players can change the story by interacting with the real-life actors.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.000
They do this orientation every hour, Monday through Friday, from 5 to 10.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
They do orientations every hour.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
I actually went to one, and there was actually a guy there

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
that talked about what the universe was.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
To make sure it wasn't a robot, I threw out a question, and he actually answered it.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
He said there were live people just talking about the game,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
and took you on a tour of the main area.

20:52.000 --> 20:57.000
If you're really into those alternate reality things, you're going to get a kick out of it.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
But if you want a game where you quest that has an objective,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
that has set goals and things you do,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Myst Online isn't going to be really feeling it for you.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
It doesn't seem like you really interact with people a lot in the beginning.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I think that's something you work towards.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
If you're a GameTap subscriber, obviously you're already paying for Myst Online,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
so go in there and look at it.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
It's worth it.

21:21.000 --> 21:28.000
If you're not already a subscriber of GameTap, is it worth it just for Myst Online?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
I'm not sure.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
You really need to check out the demo so you can see for yourself what I'm talking about,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
that it's not your typical type of MMO, and make your decision from there.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
I still recommend GameTap as a whole, because 800-something games for $9.95 a month.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I think it's a great service.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Sometimes I talk about it so well on the show, you'd think I'm on their payroll,

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
but I'm not.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I think it's a really great service.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
If you're a GameTap subscriber, go check it out.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
If you're out of the country where you don't get GameTap

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
and you're going to have to buy this game separately,

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
definitely download the demo first, because again, it's Myst, not World of Warcraft,

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
not Final Fantasy, any of that stuff.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
Also, I checked out DDR Universe for the Xbox 360.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
There's a lot of very good things about Universe.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
There's a lot of very bad things about Universe.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
Dance House Revolution Universe, the good things, song list, great.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
I love the song list.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Graphics, pretty cool, a little bit vibrant.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
I had to turn them down because they were a little too colorful,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
but the videos are very well done.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
They're vibrant.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Obviously, the game is in HD, which gives the game a whole new look.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
It's very cool.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
Things I didn't like, quest mode, quest mode, quest mode.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
That mode is atrocious.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
It's the worst thing that ever happened to DDR since True Kiss Destination.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
Seriously, it's awful.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
It is so awful. I can't even explain it.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
There's no questing to it.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
It's like you go to a city and you fucking,

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
we need to get some fame, play songs over and over and over.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
There's no explanation.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
It's poorly done.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
It's basically the same five challenges over and over,

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
and they have to unlock things through this mode as a joke.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
So if you're thinking that,

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
oh, I'm going to get a thousand easy points from DDR Universe,

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
no, you'll get about 400 from playing just play each song once.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
But quest mode, it's not even worth it.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Seriously, wait and see if an unlock code is released.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
Like remember Ultramix 2,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
like an unlock code came out later that would give you all the unlocks?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
Just wait for that.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
See if something happens.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
I don't know if there is one or not,

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
but hopefully there is because quest mode sucks.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
It's just not even worth it.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
So in other words,

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
if you are buying this game as a single player

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
who likes all that extra stuff inside DDR,

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
the game itself is really solid,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
like the songs and the steps and everything,

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
but if you're buying this for quest mode or Xbox Live,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
which basically has all the modes we've seen before,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I don't think there's really a whole lot else extra.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Let me put it this way.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
If you're contemplating upgrading to Xbox 360 just for DDR, don't.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
But if you are a 360 owner,

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
DDR is a very unique game,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
and I think it's something you should check out.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And they made it very beginner friendly, which I think is cool.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
And other good things I should say about it real quick,

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
other good things is that, again, it's very beginner friendly.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
It does have the jukebox mode and the edit step and video mode,

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
which is kind of neat.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
And again, the song list is great.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
The downloads are pretty cool.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
Yes, they're already on the disc,

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
but honestly, some of the Ultra Mixes were done the same way.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
It's something extra.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
It's not essential to the gameplay.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
And the basic game itself is fine.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
But again, some of those other things,

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
like just the fact that the frame rate is still a little buggy,

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
I swear to God,

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Cowboy Emi has her head on backwards when you play on certain songs.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
Check it out for yourself. I'm not joking.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
For a DDR hardcore fan,

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
there's going to be some things in here that really irk you.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Here's my thing that pissed me off,

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
and I don't know if you noticed it.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Did you have trouble playing on a controller with the game?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Because I had steps.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
I know I hit it on time,

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
and it gave me a good, or it gave me a complete miss.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
And I'm just like, what the fuck?

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
And I think it was either lag or there was just some sort of frame rate problem.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
Turn off the videos and dancers and see if you get the same thing.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
I turned off the videos.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
It was a little bit better.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
But here's the thing, though.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.000
You need the videos to be on in order to play Quest Mode

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
because you get special points if you buy the background videos in the game,

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
which is stupid.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I don't know.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
All right.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
So, you know, I don't know.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
Again, I do think DDR Universe is a good DDR game

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
because essentially what does DDR end up being?

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
It's all about the songs and the steps,

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
and DDR delivers on some awesome songs and great steps.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
But the other stuff kind of built around it, not so great.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
And I really hope they patch it up with Universe 2.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
And I was very disappointed to see some of those like frame rate things

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
and just that Quest Mode is so god awful

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
when the PlayStation 2 mixes had perfectly fine extra modes in them

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
that should have been brought over to the 360

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
or, you know, let the PlayStation 2 people come up with your modes

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
because Quest Mode is horrible.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
It's horrid.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
So that's it.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Okay.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
So, LankyStyle, I noticed you just joined us.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Do you want to be on the radio tonight?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
No.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Okay.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Well, tell us about your gaming week anyway because you're here

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
with your freshly shaved head, I notice.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Oh, yeah.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
What's that about?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
I just...

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Britney Spears.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Oh, I was going to say Britney Spears.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Britney Spears did it, and I love her.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
I want to do the spider with her.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
All right.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Anyhow, let's not explain what that is.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
How was your gaming week?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
Pretty good.

26:29.000 --> 26:33.000
I've been playing Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy VI for the GBA

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
and just dual wielding the Final Fantasies because that's what I do.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
And good times.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Don't have any of the new systems because I'm old school.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
But I did play DR Universe, which is pretty cool.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
I like the license tracks on it,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
but the old school tracks that they pulled back,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
that they brought back, I don't know.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
I don't think it was the best selection.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
Well, they've kind of already pulled a lot back in the other Xbox games, right?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Yeah.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
So they kind of, you know, they didn't want to repeat, so...

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000
That's true.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I know it's kind of cool they got Hot Limit back.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Eh, gay.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
All right.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Let's see.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Going to the chat.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
I'm trying to see what's being talked about previously there.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.000
Most people are kind of taken back by the True Kiss destination reference,

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
or True Kiss TKD reference I made earlier in the show.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
And then somebody had to explain the DDR games that only came out in Japan.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Let's see.

27:28.000 --> 27:33.000
Let's say there's controversy brewing over Rondo of Blood in chat.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
All right.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Let's see.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
Fireball wants to know why do I keep hearing aim noises in the background

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
because Jamie's chatting while the show's going on.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
You got busted.

27:43.000 --> 27:48.000
I always have it open just like for only one person who is listening to the show,

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
by the way, so I can keep in touch with Tiara.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Gotcha.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
All righty.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Well, now that we've gone over all our gaming weeks,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
we're going to start getting into some gaming news.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
But first, some housekeeping.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Housekeeping this week.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
First off, we want to say a big thank you and hug, hug, kiss, kiss

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
to PSP Fanboy who profiled us on their site this week.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
They, you know, posted like,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
hey, this is a cool show that you should download.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
I think it's called RSS This, so they didn't have to do that,

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
so that was very nice, and we had no idea it was coming.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
What's kind of funny about it, Jamie,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I'm not sure if you're aware what happened,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
but when they originally posted the review,

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
they said something about it's really refreshing to have gay commentators

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
on the show because Sky is gay and Dark Sakura is a lesbian,

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
and that made me go I have a bad feeling this guy listened to the episode

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
where if you go back a couple episodes,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
Dark Sakura and Chris were making those jokes back at each other

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
where Dark Sakura and Chris were joking

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
that they were going to go off and have sex.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
So that made me kind of laugh.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
So I replied, and I was like, actually, she's married.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
You may not have caught that.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
You may have downloaded the show where she was flirting with the lesbians,

29:00.000 --> 29:05.000
but she's just a cool girl who doesn't really, you know, sexualities, whatever.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
So there you go.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
So they corrected the thing, but they still like the show.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I like boobs.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
I know. You're cool. Whatever.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Oh, my God.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
I think what it boils down to, it's not that you're necessarily straight

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
or you're a lesbian. You're just a slut.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
No, I'm not.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
I'm just kidding. You're not.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I've only slept with one person ever.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
I know.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
I'm saying this right now.

29:31.000 --> 29:37.000
I'm in a monogamous relationship with my very first and only, so ha.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
And you still can look at boobs.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
There's nothing wrong with that.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Because boobs are hot and squishy.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
Very cool.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
All right.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Also, a couple other quick housekeeping things.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
I want to point out over on Orangeloungeradio.com in our forums,

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
we've opened up our feedback threads a little early now.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
So that way, those of you guys that are listening live,

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
A, if you're too chicken to join the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com,

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
you can post in our forum your live feedback as the show is going.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
And also, it's a good way for folks that are listening live

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
if they're in a chat room,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
like if they had a favorite topic or quote

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
or some funny moment that they wanted to document,

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
that can go in the thread.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
And that's really good in helping us to write our synopsis,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
what you guys liked,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
because then we kind of know what to feature in the show

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
because you guys say you liked it.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
So just a little thing there.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Also, we want to mention this.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
This doesn't directly have to do with us,

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
but we're kind of throwing our support behind it, shall we say.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Obviously, if you didn't already know,

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
Orange Lounge Radio is rebroadcast on a network called All Games,

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
available at allgames.com,

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
and we rebroadcast there in full parts A and B

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
Monday night at 5.30 Pacific time

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m. Pacific time.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
And it's us syndicated on there,

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
as well as a bunch of other podcasts you may have heard of,

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Evil Avatar, Chatterbox, Video Game Outsiders,

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
Game Attic Hotline, just to name a few.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
There's a lot of good shows that are syndicated on there.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
All Games is trying to build this community-type thing.

31:03.000 --> 31:09.000
It's kind of like Myspace, but without the suck,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
because Myspace, as nice as it is,

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
and you get a lot of attention there and everything,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
the problem with Myspace is that I don't know about you guys,

31:15.000 --> 31:19.000
but I'm getting all these cam girls and sluts

31:19.000 --> 31:22.000
and hey, cam guys and everything that are trying to add me on there,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
and you have to filter out all this spam and crap

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
to get through Myspace.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
So I guess All Games found this other service called Ning

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
that allows you to create your own social network

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
without all the frickin' ads and all that stuff.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
And that's pretty cool.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
You can have your own blog on there and talk about stuff,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
and then the blogs go to the front page,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
and you can add your own videos and all that stuff.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
So it's pretty cool.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
I think we've all made profiles on there.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I know Dr. Sakura did. I did.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Loki, you're making one or will be making one.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.000
Haven't made one yet, but yeah.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
Would you? Okay.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
So if you want to check that out, it's community.allgames.com.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
And granted, we could have used Ning to make our own page,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
our own social network, the Orange Lounge social network,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
but we kind of didn't see the point

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
because we're all about indie podcasting,

32:05.000 --> 32:10.000
and we know the reality is we're probably not the only game podcast you listen to.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
And also, if you're an All Games listener,

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
most of the other podcasts you listen to are probably on All Games.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
So why don't we all band together and contribute to this one network

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
as opposed to having ten little ones?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
So there you have it.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I actually posted a blog post there today,

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
so go check it out and comment on it and tell me what you thought.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
See? Isn't that cool?

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
All right. I think that's it for housekeeping.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.000
So we will get into some game news now.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Who's starting us off tonight?

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
I do believe that would be me.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
Congratulations.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
Well, for all five of us who have PlayStation 3s,

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
we have something to look forward to.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
The firmware is being updated to 1.54

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
that will add video chat features so that we can, I guess,

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
watch naked people and sweaty fanboys on the other side.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
But if it's our screen format, hey, that'd be great.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
And if you've also...

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
This, of course, is more going to go toward any of the UK listeners,

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
but if you've imported your PS3,

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
you'd go into the system menu and update via the Internet,

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
or you can download the firmware from the U.S. or Japanese support sites.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
We actually have to pay 20 bucks for it.

33:23.000 --> 33:28.000
I'm sorry, 20 bucks for Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Over in the UK, that would be $6.99.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
And that's really the only differences I'm seeing coming up with that.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
I didn't download that either.

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
I was like, eh, no.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
Twenty-some dollars is too much for me to pay for a game.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
That you download.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I was going to say, you paid like 60 bucks for...

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
Yeah, but there's a big difference between Tekken and Dig Dug.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
I'm also not a Tekken fan.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
I'm not really a fighting game fan either.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
I don't think Tekken is worth $600,

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
which is essentially what you're going to try to sell me on,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
because I still don't have a PlayStation 3.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And Flow, I still haven't gotten Flow.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
It's like, I have trouble paying $8.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
You mean After Dark, the game?

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
Yeah, exactly.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
They should have put toasters in there.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
That would be even better.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
That would be fun.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
If you didn't listen to last week's show, by the way,

34:20.000 --> 34:26.000
we did tell Sony exactly how to win the next gen war race.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
And I'm thinking, even though we said this should be a retail game,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
it may work if they put it on Xbox Live Marketplace.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
And once again, that is Laser Cats the game.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.000
If they can obtain the license to Laser Cats and get the exclusive

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
and put it on Xbox Live Market, or, whoops.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
PlayStation Network.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
See?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
See where my mind goes?

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
I don't even realize there's a PlayStation Network,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
so I'll have Laser Cats 3.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
Well, if Xbox beats them to it, that's the nail in Sony's coffin.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
So there you go.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
It's a race now.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
This is the real next gen wars.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Who will obtain Laser Cats the game,

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
because that will be the victor of the next gen war.

35:03.000 --> 35:08.000
Now, not necessarily adding lasers to cats is a good idea.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
I mean, for example, there was a game called Laser Dolphin

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
that came out that was basically a rip-off of Echo the Dolphin.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
I think it might have even been made by the same people.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
And, yeah, it sucked.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
They basically added weapons to a bunch of the sea life,

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
and it wasn't very fun.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
But they had dolphins with freaking laser on their heads.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
So, I don't know.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
It's a start.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
It's a start.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
Another start would be the future updates

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
getting some upscaling for your DVDs.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
Now, this is, I think, a feature that's already on the Xbox 360,

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
and it's already on Blu-Ray players out there,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
at least some of the Sony ones

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
and I think some of the other ones out there.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
But that's something that's going to be coming later on.

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
Of course, normal DVDs upscaled look pretty good.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
Not exactly going to be as great as content that was made for that resolution.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
But, hey, something's better than nothing.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
I'd rather have my DVDs look a little bit better.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
So, hooray!

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Something that's in the update other than video chat,

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
because guess what?

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
I don't have any friends on the PlayStation Network,

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
so video chat's kind of useless to me.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
You have no friends on the PlayStation Network?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Yeah, I have Bobby on there, and that's about it.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
That is the only friend on my friends list.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Aw, Bobby's your only friend?

36:30.000 --> 36:36.000
And I don't even play online, really, with the PS3.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I've never played Resistance online,

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
which I really need to do because it's supposed to be pretty good.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
And then Motorstorm, which this week we're going to have that,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
and maybe I'll play that online,

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
but Motorstorm is not two-player split-screen.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
That fucking sucks.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
Why the hell can't they do split-screen games anymore?

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Is it just too graphic-intensive?

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
Because you're essentially having to render the two things at once.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
Well, I would think that the cell processor could handle that.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
I don't know.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
I mean, shit, it should be able to reconstruct my DNA.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
I mean, the cell is awesome, right?

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
Anyways, so upscaling DVDs,

37:13.000 --> 37:18.000
I think the cell processor should be able to do that, hopefully.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
All right, let's see, going on to the chat room

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
and kind of looking at what's going on in chat.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Let's see, the Rob D. was correcting me from earlier

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
and said it's actually not $600.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
It's $599 U.S. dollars.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
Oh, sorry, but you forgot tax and all that other crap they throw in there.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
$599, 99.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Yeah.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Let's see, Holy Shonen says,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Aw, poor Loki, Bobby, his only friend.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
And Rama says, Loki is the Charlie Brown of Orange Lounge Radio.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Did you want to give out your username

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
so that other listeners can take pity on you

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
and you can have more than one friend?

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
It's just Loki space O-L-R.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Oh, there you go.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
All right.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
I don't think it's just no one has PlayStation 3s.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.000
I have one.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Wait, why aren't you guys friends?

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Because you don't like Loki?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Because she doesn't play her PlayStation 3.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Yes, I do.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
I played it all day today.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I sold one of my PlayStation 3 games.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
I sold Full Auto 2 finally.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
I'm still keeping Ridge Racer 7 just for the fuck of it.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Because it's Ridge Racer.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Exactly.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
It's Ridge Racer 6 and new packaging for the PlayStation 3.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Fucking 8.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I'm not buying Ridge Racer 8.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Hear me now, Namco.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
You need to change more than just...

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
Look, the cars are a little bit more shiny.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
And the tracks are a little bit more shiny.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
What if Ridge Racer 8 allowed you to select

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Toons is the driving cat as a driver?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Would you then buy Ridge Racer 8?

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
No, I wouldn't.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
Although, if Ridge Racer 8 had tons of sluts everywhere,

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
then maybe.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
That's what they need.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
You know, the one cover chick is cool,

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
but you need lots of sluts.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
You need this to be like an import magazine.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
You know, fucking tuner shit.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
Where you have hot Asian busty models everywhere.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
This is what will sell Ridge Racer for you.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Why are you rolling your eyes, Jamie?

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
You just said five minutes ago you like boobs.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
I wasn't rolling my eyes.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
I was popping my neck.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Oh.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
I'm telling you, this is what they need.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Because Ridge Racer doesn't really stand out.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
And you know what?

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
Need for speed and fucking juiced and stuff

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
are kind of getting a little bit better.

39:19.000 --> 39:25.000
But seriously, more women could never hurt.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
Well, I don't know if there'd be anything in that for me.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
Who cares?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
You don't play Ridge Racer.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
I do too.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
I played Ridge Racer 6.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Then you'll like it with the women.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.000
Fine.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
I do like boobs.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
It's fun.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Like she said, they're squishy.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
They put it this way.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
They make good pillows.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Well, if you like Ridge Racer as it is now,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
then it won't matter.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Because they'll still be the same.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
It'll just have extra women in there.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
If the women aren't for you, then there you go.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
You've still got Ridge Racer.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Let's see.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Fireboma says Ridge Racer 8.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Sluts everywhere.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Alpha Canogram gives the mandatory LOL sluts.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
GS68 says Ridge Racer Xtreme Beach Volleyball.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
There you go.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
And Bobby Black Wolf just joined chat going,

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
did someone say my name?

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
To which Rob D promptly responded,

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
it's Loki's only friend, Black Wolf.

40:19.000 --> 40:30.000
Are you going to put the patent down on this Ridge Racer?

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
Ridge Racer 8.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
No, because they'll never do it.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I mean, they're still making weird.

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
They still think that fucking Peanuts is a valuable franchise to them.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
I mean, come on.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
All right.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Actually, I wanted to pull up here.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I actually have.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
I overheard Black Wolf and Loki talking earlier,

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
and I actually found the theme song of their relationship.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
So here it is.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
I'm your only friend.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I'm not your only friend.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
But I'm a little blowing friend.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
But really, I'm not actually your friend.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
But I am.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Haven't you ever heard this song in your life?

41:12.000 --> 41:18.000
Never mind.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
OK.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
Joke gone wrong.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
Also, something that went way wrong earlier this week

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
was the relationship between Kotaku and Sony.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
Surely, if you've been anywhere on the internet this week on game blogs,

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
you've heard about this whole fiasco.

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Basically, Kotaku published this rumor,

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
and the rumor is that PlayStation is going to be unveiling

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
the PlayStation Home at Game Developers Conference.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
Quote, basically, you get to make an avatar for your console, like a me,

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
and this avatar has a room.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
As you play games and accomplish certain tasks,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
you will receive items with which to adorn the room

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
that are specific to the game, achievements.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
The kicker is that this is going to be a new requirement

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
for every PlayStation 3 game.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Awesome.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
PlayStation is doing something right.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
They are ripping off some of the best parts of Nintendo and Microsoft,

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
which is what they need to do.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
That's fine.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Everybody rips each other off.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
They're ripping off the Wii and Animal Crossing from Nintendo.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
They're ripping off the achievements from Xbox 360

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
and making a more dynamic online service to compete with them.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
Great.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
This sounds like a wonderful thing.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Certainly, this couldn't be bad press.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
This is good news for Sony for once.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
And what does Sony do?

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
They fuck it up with bad press because suddenly,

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
like not even five minutes after this rumor goes up,

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
Kotaku gets this huge Yudon fucked up letter from Sony.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
I don't have the letter in front of me,

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
but essentially it said you're a bad person for running that story.

42:43.000 --> 42:47.000
Therefore, you're uninvited from our press conferences.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
We want you to send the dev kit back.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
We're slapping you on the wrist, blah, blah, blah.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
It is the equivalent of playing Monopoly with somebody who's losing,

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
and they throw the board up in the air and say,

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
Fuck this game.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
I'm taking my board home.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
That's basically what happened, yes?

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Fair to say?

43:03.000 --> 43:10.000
Yeah, and they're worried about negative press from the story.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
So this catches wildfire because everybody's like,

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
What the hell did Kotaku do wrong?

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
Not only did they pretty much prove this rumor to be true,

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I mean, come on.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Is there any way this rumor could not be true?

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Well, that and the fact that they've also registered trademarks

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
for PlayStation Home.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
That came out later.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
You're jumping in later.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Sorry.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
But now we all knew the damn thing was true.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
What they really had to do is just...

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
We do not comment on rumors.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
If Sony had kept their mouth shut,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
they could have still had somewhat of a surprise

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
at Game Developers Conference.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
But from this happening, did they not think,

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
Oh, well, if we're going to slap Kotaku's wrist,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
don't you think they're probably going to blog about it

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
since obviously Sony doesn't care about him anymore?

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
Well, here's the other thing that I think is kind of bad.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Real quick, obviously the rest of the story is

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
the rest of the internet banded behind Kotaku.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
It got on Digg.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Even other blogs like Destructoid

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
changed their title banner to basically say,

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Brian Crescente has the biggest balls in the world,

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
something like that.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
The entire internet is jumping behind what Kotaku did,

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
and Sony got its tail between its legs now,

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
has to go, Oh, we made a mistake.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Kotaku, can we play nice again?

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
And they made up.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
They kissed and made up.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Well, here's the whole thing.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
The big focus wasn't about this whole story.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
It was that Sony was trying to dictate to a blog

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
what stories they could post and what they can't.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
They're reporting on stuff.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
It's free speech.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
They can do whatever the fuck they want.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
It's like if there's a negative story about them,

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
they don't want anything to do with you.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
So it's kind of like they want this blog

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
to be in their pocket type thing.

44:49.000 --> 44:54.000
But of course they have better journalistic integrity

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
than Sony had believed, so it didn't quite go their way.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
They thought, Oh, big bad, Sony's going to make a huff and puff,

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
and they're going to just be like, Oh, okay, we'll take the story down then.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
Rama says, Sky, the whole Kotaku Sony thing

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
was a damn publicity stunt.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
What do you think?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
No.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
Where's the evidence to back that up?

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
I don't know.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
It's not a publicity stunt.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I think it's just being stupid.

45:16.000 --> 45:21.000
Why wouldn't Sony use their own three something,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
that site they have?

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
It's called like three...

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I keep thinking of Frogger 2 three deep.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
I don't know why, but they have...

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
Yes, please.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Blog site's called Frogger 2 three.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
Could I have said anything more random?

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
They have some site, three something,

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
that shows how much we care.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
Three play.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Thank you.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
You knew that the whole time.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
You just wanted to watch me struggle.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
They had three play or whatever.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Couldn't they have just used that for their publicity?

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
Or is it because no one reads three play?

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
It was probably this.

45:47.000 --> 45:50.000
It was probably that the news sounds very much like,

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
Mm, they're ripping off people,

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
and they're probably going to go, Mm, this is our original idea.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
We were the first to ever have achievements.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
I could see them saying that.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Yo, Microsoft's copying us.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
It's just retards like that.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
I can't help, I know...

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I don't know.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Great, I guess, that they're doing this.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Cool.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I'm not going to buy more games, though, because of it.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
I'm sorry.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Microsoft was smart to do the achievements,

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
because I'm a sucker,

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
and I buy crappy games like Bullet Witch,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
because of this shit.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
And no matter how hard I try,

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
I can't do that, because I'm hooked, like crack.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
And so, you know, the PlayStation Network or whatever,

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
great, I get crap for my virtual house.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
That's awesome.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
I'll show it to all my friends.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
Oh, wait, Bobby is my only friend on there.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
So, great, that's going to be awesome.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
I can't wait to show all my friend, you know.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
It's just stupid, though.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
That's the problem.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
They don't get it.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
It's not because people are not buying a PlayStation 3

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
or going on their network service,

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
because there's no achievements or Miis.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
It's because it's $600, not because there's no Miis.

47:03.000 --> 47:08.000
I didn't go, oh, wow, you know, there's Miis on here now.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I guess I'll spend $600 on a PlayStation 3.

47:10.000 --> 47:15.000
No, that's not the reason why people aren't buying your platform.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Jamie, you want to chime in?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I like Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

47:19.000 --> 47:24.000
Okay, what if, let's say PlayStation puts out a patch.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
They actually do have an online version on that, by the way.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Well, let's say PlayStation comes out with a patch

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
and all the old games get this too,

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
because there's relatively enough games out there

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
where they could go back to all the old games and patch them.

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
And let's say you could get a Captain America shield in your house from playing.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
Would that be cool?

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Yes, it would.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
But is that enough to be like a real robust feature

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
that could sell the PlayStation 3?

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
It's like, hey, come over to my house.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I've got a Captain America shield.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
My answer time.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
It would be, hey, come over to my house,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
I have a Captain America shield in it.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
If it were like something where the whole environment

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
was very like Animal Crossing,

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
where you can walk around and talk to people

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
in like this big online chat room almost with avatars,

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
that would be kind of cool.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Which it could be.

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
Keep in mind, it hasn't been officially announced yet.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
If it was browser the MMO or something,

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
then that would be one.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
I don't think it's enough to sell the system.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
That's exactly what I think,

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
is that I don't think it's $600 cool,

48:22.000 --> 48:26.000
but Sony badly needs something cute like this

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
to kind of help their image, if that makes any sense.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Like they really need something like this.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
But again, it boils down to the games.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
Well, they need something also to flesh out their network

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
because right now their network's just kind of a clusterfuck of,

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I don't know what's going on, you know.

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
I mean, there's no downloadable content for the games.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
There's hardly any demos online.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
There's hardly any download content other than PlayStation 1 games.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Great! PlayStation 1 games.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I need a PS3 to download games to my PSP.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
Which, by the way, people have broke already,

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
so you can, you know, copy them and completely, you know, pirate the shit.

49:03.000 --> 49:10.000
But it's like there's no motivation for me to go online with this thing at all.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
I mean, I'm sorry.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
There's just, Motorstorm's going to be a great game.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Great.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
I feel like I should buy a PlayStation 3 just to be your friend

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
and take pity on you.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
I just, I feel so bad for you and you're my friend.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Why? I don't play my PlayStation 3.

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
I play my 360 and I've been playing the Wii a little bit,

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
but mainly my 360.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
And there was a time when I was playing Resistance,

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
I'm like, well, I don't know when am I going to go back and play my 360.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Well, it didn't take long to finish Resistance

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
and then there's no reason to play it anymore.

49:39.000 --> 49:44.000
So now I'm back to playing my 360 where there's a bunch of new shit coming out,

49:44.000 --> 49:49.000
which is great, you know, but PlayStation 3 doesn't have anything really unique to it.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
It's everything, if I'm going to get a game,

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
I'm going to get it on the 360 because it has achievements.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Black Wolf's getting a little territorial.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
Black Wolf says, no, Sky, he's my friend.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
You stay back, bitch.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
You can add me and Dan.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
We're on there as Gunstar Hero.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
Cue the scary music theme, single white female, whatever.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
All right, so definitely something that we'll continue to develop next week,

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
a Game Developers Conference when they actually announced it.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Oh, wait, sorry, it's supposed to be a rumor, but come on,

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
we all know it's probably true.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
It is true.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
They've already registered the fucking trademarks for it.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
They got a logo for it.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
It's coming out.

50:25.000 --> 50:30.000
They just didn't want it to look like this was something that they thought up real quick

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
or anything like, I don't know, a six-axis controller.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
We always meant for that to have tilt control.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
It wasn't like after we saw the Wii or anything that we decided to put this in here.

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
Could someone going to Game Developers Conference randomly shout out,

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
I love you Kotaku, during the Sony press conference like after or before

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
when everybody's coming in?

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
I would do it myself, but I'm afraid of getting kicked out.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
So I need someone with bigger balls.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
I can't even go, so at least I didn't get invited.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
You can just go.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Is it free?

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Well, if you're a press, yes.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I think you'd have to register, though.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
You can do it at the thing.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
You can't do that.

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
Yes, you can.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
Anyway, I'll talk to you offline.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
All right, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
Well, there is a little bit more from Sony.

51:19.000 --> 51:25.000
They have their launch lineup for the European PlayStation Network.

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
There will be a few downloads available on March 23rd,

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
some 5 Dark Resurrection for £6.99,

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Blast Factor for £3.49,

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
and Gran Turismo HD Trial for free.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
Other games that are set to come out are on the 30th,

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
Super Rub-a-Dub, which is a duct,

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
6th of April, Flow, 13th April, Go Sudoku,

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
and 20th April, Go Puzzle.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
So there's just a few things available for that.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Have you noticed that a lot of their games that they make

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
for the online network that use 6-axis tilt controls

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
are just games where it's involving you shooting something

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
or something in water that you tilt the thing around.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
That is like the only thing that the 6-axis is good for

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
is like fucking Etch A Sketch shit.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
For the record, I hate the 6-axis.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Actually...

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
I hate it.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
Why?

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
Because you had to do shit with it on Marvel Ultimate Alliance

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
and it's so fucking unwieldy.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
It just is an annoyance.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Actually, that would be kind of funny as an Etch A Sketch

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
because you could use the analog sticks and use the dials

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
and then you could shake the controller to clear it.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
I don't know.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
They should make downloadable...

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
But what if I had Parkinson's

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
and I'd never be able to draw anything?

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Well...

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
I don't know.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Don't buy that then.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
Don't buy a Wii.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Buy a 360 then.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Alright.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
I will.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
The 360 will rumble for you.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
Anyways, so...

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Apparently, there's been some rumors going around

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
that the 20 gigabyte version of the PlayStation 3

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
is on its way out.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
And...

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Sony, of course, is saying,

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
no, that's not the case.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
It's just...

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
You know, that model, it's...

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Depending up to the stores, you know,

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
what they want to carry in their store,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
whether the 60 gig or 20 gig,

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
and unfortunately, the 60 gigs,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
they're doing more than the 20 gigs,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
so people are bringing in less 20 gig systems

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
into their stores.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
Personally, though, from a distributor standpoint,

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
we can't get 20 gigs anymore.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
The company we get them through won't sell them anymore.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
So...

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Take that as you will.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
So, they may not be on the way out,

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
but they sort of are on the way out

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
because the 60 gigs they're selling in.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
I heard a rumor that it might actually be cheaper

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
for them to produce a 60 gig over the 20 gig,

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
which that doesn't make any sense, but...

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
You know, whatever.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
I guess, you know, maybe they may announce something

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
at Game Developers Conference, you know,

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
that they're redesigning the PS3

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
or something like that, so...

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Now in pretty colors!

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Oh, yeah.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
You know what?

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
That might be pretty smart to beat Nintendo

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
to the market with that kind of crap.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
Beat them at their own game?

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Yeah, exactly.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Well, unless they come out and say,

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
now in pretty colors and $200 cheaper,

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
I don't know if I'm sold yet.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Anyhow, something that might bring some people

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
back to the PlayStation 3,

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
including Hideo Kojima,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
you know, if you can think back to an old story.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
I mean, yes, we all know Metal Gear Solid 4

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
is coming out on 360, but...

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
I can't get Microsoft out of my mind tonight.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
What the fuck?

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Apparently, Metal Gear Solid 4

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
is coming out on PlayStation 3,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
but what did Kojima say he missed?

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
Rumble, right?

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
And that was an essential part of Metal Gear Solid,

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
and obviously Rumble is not on the PlayStation 3.

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
Well, apparently Rumble could be coming back,

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
and the reason why we say could be

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
is because Sony and Immersion have settled

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
their patent litigation.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Think back, in the past,

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Immersion sued Sony over the Rumble thing.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
They actually settled with Microsoft,

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
and I believe Nintendo had already worked it out

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
with Immersion before they ever put it in there.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
They worked it out with the other two companies.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
That's why you have Rumble and the 360 and the Wii.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
But Sony was just like, well, screw you.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
We're not going to have Rumble then.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Rumble is so last-gen, if it's going to be like that.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
Since Wii can dictate what is next-gen and what is not,

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
we're just going to say Rumble is so last-gen.

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
Sony seems like a big, whiny child to me.

55:21.000 --> 55:27.000
They think they have the edge on the competition,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
but really, they're just kind of trailing behind

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
in ideas and innovation.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
This time.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Well, this time, I mean, all the time.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
When have they been ahead?

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
Okay, granted, they had a DVD drive in the PlayStation 2.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Okay, good for them.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
That's good.

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
On top of PlayStation 1 and 2, they were a little bit ahead of time.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
They were behind on the fucking Rumble technology.

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
They're behind on analog sticks on there.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
And even the controller designs,

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
fucking copying off of the Super Nintendo.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
So, I don't know.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
They're just playing the copycat game.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Oh, they did it pretty well the last two gens.

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
Well...

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
All right, well, anyway.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
What makes this whole thing very interesting

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
is what Kazurai had to say after this whole thing.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
Quote,

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
We look forward to exploring with Immersion exciting new ways

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
to bring the largest and best range of gameplay experiences to our customers.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
We are very excited about our new partnership with Immersion

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
and the potential for new and innovative products

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
incorporating their technologies.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Great, I gotta buy new controllers now.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Thank you very much.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
I hope I can trade them in.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
Interesting, I guess is all I can say.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.000
I mean, not even like three days ago,

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
someone over at Sony, I don't remember who said it,

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
but somebody said it was probably that crazy guy from Sony Europe,

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Phil Harrison.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I think he was the one that said,

56:44.000 --> 56:51.000
Rubble is so last gen.

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
And now things seem to change on a dime yet again.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.000
Well...

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
We do, though.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
Anything in this industry, though, does change pretty crazy,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
including release dates.

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
However, I have a fairly decent list for our UK listeners.

57:09.000 --> 57:14.000
So, starting with the releases on the 5th,

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
which would be tomorrow for us, actually it's the 5th there already,

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
is Wario Master of Disguise in the DS.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
Coming up on the 9th is Bullet Witch,

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Castlevania Portrait of Ruin,

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Garfield's Nightmare,

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Grand Theft Auto by City Stories,

57:27.000 --> 57:28.000
Luminesce Plus,

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2,

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
March of the Minis,

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Rogue Galaxy,

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Runaway 2,

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
The Dream of the Turtle,

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Silver Fall,

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
The Hustle of Detroit Streets,

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2,

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
and Trackmania United on PC.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
Cool.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
We actually have a pretty good week as far as release dates in the United States.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Definitely some good stuff,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
especially one of my favorites,

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
coming to the Playstation 2,

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Grand Theft Auto by City Stories,

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
for the whopping cheap price of $19.99.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
So, you should definitely check it out.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Of course, I don't think there's going to be multiplayer in there,

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
so that kind of sucks.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
Let's see,

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 for the 360 and the PC,

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
Def Jam Icon for Playstation 3 and the 360.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.000
That should be pretty cool.

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
Titan Quest Immortal Throne for the PC.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
Let's see,

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
Motorstorm on the Playstation 3.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Can't wait to pick that one up.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
Wario, Master of Disguise on the DS,

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
as well as I believe Rayman's Raving Rabbids,

58:29.000 --> 58:34.000
and Shrek's Smash and Crash Racing on the DS.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
Burnout Dominator on Playstation 2 and the PSP,

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
and it looks like Tortuga,

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
Two Treasures on the PC.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
I do believe there's also a Sudoku game coming out as well,

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
but I don't think anyone's going to pick that up.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
But that's the big stuff.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.000
All right.

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
Oh, NBA Street Home Court on the PS3, that's right.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
Coming out over in Japan,

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
because sometimes the games that we get over here

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
are often based off what comes out in Japan.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
Over on the Playstation 3,

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
Power Smash 3 is coming out from Sega,

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
but you know the series as Virtua Tennis,

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
and that's coming out on March the 8th.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
On some other systems,

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
over on the Nintendo Wii,

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
Bomberman Land Wii is coming out on March 8th.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
See, this is why I like doing the same.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
I didn't even know they were making a freaking Bomberman game for the Wii,

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
so there you have it.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
Hopefully much better than Bomberman Act Zero.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
Hopefully they don't take Bomberman into the future.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
We'll see what happens.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
A game called iShield 21 from Nintendo

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
is actually coming out over in Japan this week as well.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
It looks like it could be a fighting game or something.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I'm not sure exactly what this is.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
They file it into the...

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
It's actually more of an action game, it looks like.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
I'm trying to see what some of the screenshots look like.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Looks like it has a bunch of different modes in it there,

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
like you kick a ball in one mode as a football player.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Looks like another one you kind of throw a football.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I think it might be an amateur Olympics type of game.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
So there you have it.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Maybe someone in chat will pipe up who knows more about that game.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Which one?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
It's called iShield 21.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
It's an anime-based football game, I think.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Interesting.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
If I remember correctly.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And it's just like, I guess, Imagine Madden,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
but with fictional football characters, they're anime.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Alright.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Coming out on the PlayStation 2,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000
you have Guitar Freaks and Drummania Masterpiece Gold

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
coming out over in Japan.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
You used to import all those Guitar Freaks games, Jamie.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Are you going to get this one?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
No.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Why not? What made you stop?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I have a life.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Alrighty then.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Major League Baseball 2K6 comes out of Japan

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
for the PlayStation 2 on March 8th.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
2K6?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
That's what it says, 2K6.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Probably 2K7.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Is that a typo?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
It could be.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Probably.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
No, that's the screenshot for 2K6.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Holy crap, they're behind.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Little bit.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
That's probably 2K7.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I don't know why you would want to purchase 2K6.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Maybe they're just a little behind.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Kenka Banchu 2 Full Throttle also comes out

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
on the PlayStation 2 this week.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
It's another action game.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Looks like it's probably based on an anime.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Little fighting game, scary looking man in that game.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Let's see if there's any other systems

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I want to announce release dates for.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
How about Nintendo DS?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
There's a whole lot of crap coming out on the DS

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
this next week.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Doraemon is coming out.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Doraemon Nobita no Shinmaki Daibouken is coming out.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Dragon Sakura DS is coming out as well.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
EQ Trainer DS, another one of those training games.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Fun.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Let's see, a couple of games in the puzzle series

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
from Hudson also coming out as well.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I should mention this because this is probably

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
the biggest release of the week over for Japan.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Second Detsetsu Heroes of Mana coming out

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
from Square Enix.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I imagine that would be the next Mana game

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
that we're going to get over here.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
We're getting Dawn of Mana next.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
It's probably the same thing, just a different name.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
That's, of course, speculation from someone

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
who has not done their research on what exactly

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
that game is.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
No problem.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I forgot to mention there was some exclusive stuff

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
that we had, of course, this week for release.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
It's very small though.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
There's a brand new Wii game coming out later this year.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge for the Wii

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
coming out November, or not November, July 11th.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
And that game, Spelling Spree, which was being released

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
by Ubisoft is now known as Wordplay.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
So I guess they thought Spelling Spree was retarded

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
as a name.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I would like to thank everyone in chat room

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
who was yelling at me over what Ice Shield 21 is.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
You all watch far more Japanese import animation

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
than I do.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
There you have it.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
It's fucking football, don't ask.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
My bad.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Yeah, Rob, you should know better.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Sorry, did you know what it was?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Did you say anything to try to correct me?

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
I know, I like seeing you flounder.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
You're a bitch.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I know so.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Well, speaking of bitchy things,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
you know, these things that are going to have

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
other companies bitching,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
it has been speculated that the Wii is going to

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:20.000
outsell the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 through 2008.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
The market research firm IDC has basically stated

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
that they believe the hardware shipments of the Wii

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
will capture more than a third of the worldwide market

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
by 2008.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And it will rise above the PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000
In related news, I still don't give a shit what an analyst has to say.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I think it's already proving, though, to be that way.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Just, you know, look at how it's performing.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I'll give you that.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
But I get so sick of these.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Analyst says this.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Stories making it to blogs.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
That's why I'm not talking about any stories with analysts.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
And it's catching a lot of news and what have you.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And you're right.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
The whole reason I thought that it was relevant

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
is because it is happening.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
It's something that we actually see happening.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I'll give you that.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Just like we had this week as well.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
There was another analyst that said that the PlayStation 3

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
is going to take over by 2010.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Then there was another analyst that says the Wii is going to take over.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Then there was another analyst that says that the 360 is going to take over.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
We need someone to analyze the analyst.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So you know what that means?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
It's crap information.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Your guess is as good as their guess.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
What do you think about this guess?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I mean, I actually kind of agree with it.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I do think the Wii will continue to outpace 360 and PlayStation 3

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
just based on the reactions of people I see who aren't gamers.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Again, keep in mind, Kars was one of the top selling games last year.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Not thanks to any hardcore gamer who reads the blogs

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
and thinks that that's the whole gaming world right there in that bubble.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
The casual gamer is what's going to push the Wii, I believe,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
ahead of those other two systems.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I don't think so.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I think the 360, there's going to be some great games coming out.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
It's a little bit slow in the beginning of the year.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
January, there's like Lost Planet coming out.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Or was it January? There's like two games for the 360.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Most people were still picking up the Wiis

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
because they couldn't get a hold of them at launch.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Right now, I think by the end of this year,

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I still think the 360 is going to be beating the crap out of the Wii.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
But I don't really hear people talking about Lost Planet anymore.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Yet I still hear people talking about Wii Sports.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Well, that's because people are simpletons and they like Wii Sports.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Big deal.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
People are picking up Wii Play, not because of Wii Play,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
but because it came with another controller.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Nintendo's just not putting out enough product.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I have a story here real quick that Nintendo is slow

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
to resupply retailers with brand new Wiis.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I can attest to that.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Distribution for the month of March is being cut out of their replenishment cycles.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Basically, Nintendo has said, guess what?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
The distributors out there, you're not getting any new Wiis for the month of March.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
We're giving them all to retailers because we can't make enough.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
So they right now are having a problem with production,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
and I think they just need to pump out as main systems,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:15.000
but eventually it's going to plateau once all those people that were waiting to get one finally get one.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
But right now, Super Paper Mario is coming out in April,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000
but there's not any real big games announced that have definite dates yet other than the fall.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
So I think it's going to just plateau.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Yay, it's the DS drought all over again despite what Mr. Fils-Aime said previously.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Yeah, seriously, Mario Party's been delayed to whenever, at least summer.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And then there's really a lot of crappy games coming out.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
But Zelda Ocarina of Time on Virtual Console.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Fap, fap, fap.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Oh goody, great.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
That's awesome.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Virtual Console, totally the reason why you should buy a Wii.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It's kind of, you have to admit, for some, again, casual gamers, that kind of appeals to them.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Well great, but I don't think it's going to sell systems though.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000
I think really right now people saw WarioWare and it was a lot of fun,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
and they're seeing some of the games coming out probably in March,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:14.000
but there is going to be a drought, and I think that's going to plateau off.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000
If it's the 360, if they have as big of a month as they're planning to in May,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
it's going to keep going.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And I think with Game Developer Conference there's going to be some major announcements.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
And then eventually, especially with November, we're just going to see it take off again,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
with Halo 3 especially.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
So, I don't know.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Going back to both these topics here, Gaming Nerd in chat says,

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
by 2010, none of these consoles are going to be good since the next gen will be here,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
and some console will get released a year before the rest.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Good point.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Let's see, also talking about JV Mon says, who the fuck cares about Ocarina?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Thank you very much, because I think Ocarina is one of the most overhyped games ever.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I like Ocarina of Time. It's one of my favorite games.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I like it. I like it.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
It's one of my favorite games.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
There are certain websites out there that review some of these Zelda games,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
and because it's Zelda, they give it a 10 out of 10.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Not saying which websites, but I saw that and rolled my eyes and go,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
well, I kind of figured you'd do this,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
seeing as you've got a big heart on over fucking Twilight Princess,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
which I might add, it's a great game, but it's not perfect.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I did have a heart on over Twilight Princess, actually.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
It wasn't fucking the greatest thing on earth.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I've seen way better.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
But actually, it was pretty good.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000
But anyway, no, I don't think, for me, Ocarina was no Link to the Past.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
That was my problem.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Call me a 2D gamer, whatever, but that was my problem,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
was Ocarina was no Link to the Past.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Exactly. So, whatever.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Controversial viewpoint, sorry, what can I say?

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
That's what we love to have here on this show, our controversial viewpoints.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
What we also love on this show are other little bits of retro goodness,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
and this always makes me squee,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
and I notice Rice Princess is here joining us now,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
so say hello to the fanboys and girls.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Rice Princess?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Hello.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
How are you doing this week?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Kind of tired.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Sorry to hear that.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
You want to nap on the ground there while we do the show?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
No, it's filthy.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
All right.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I don't know if you remember this game, Rice Princess,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
but coming to the Wii from System 3,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
we've talked about this previously on the show,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.000
but we have some box art now for Impossible Mission coming out to the Wii,

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
and...

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Are you freaking joking? This is awesome.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
No, I'm not.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
This is news that just makes you want to shout,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Ahhhhhhhhhhh.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It's more like, another visitor, stay a while, stay forever.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Nobody's going to get that.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Anyway, Impossible Mission, if you can believe it,

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
came out 25 years ago,

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
was one of the first games to use real synthesized speech,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
such as the type that Rice Princess and I just performed for you guys.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Keep in mind, this is not Mission Impossible.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.720
This was I guess you could call it a spoof game. There's some cool little screenshots there

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.360
These are from the DS version of the game, but look at that

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:12.940
It's like it's like what they did right with this is the same damn game. Just would like really pretty graphics

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.120
That's pretty cool, and it's also coming out on the PSP

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:21.880
You can see PSP DS and Wii so very curious to see what's gonna happen there also. What's new to this game

01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.960
There is a new tutorial mode

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.720
There's also three game modes and three characters to choose from

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.880
The characters look to be the dude that was in the original game a chick now

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:38.320
Is that chick or a guy with long hair actually can't tell oh, no, it's a chick and a robot named gamma

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.240
What

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.240
What it is a robot

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.640
Anyway, the three game modes you can play new

01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:53.340
Original and of course the hybrid mode the original game with the updated graphics swoon

01:10:53.340 --> 01:11:00.100
Okay, so when you play the robot does he say get him my humans like that doesn't make sense. Why a robot what the hell?

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:03.460
Maybe it's like a Android or something

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:08.900
I don't know can't you still say get him my robots, and it's you know cuz what they did they shot out little electricity beams

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:14.260
And if you're made of metal, that's probably gonna hurt. I don't know that just seems a little bit shady to me

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.260
I don't know if I want this game anymore

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:20.980
You're gonna not buy this game based off the fact you could play as a robot

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:28.580
Yeah, and I could also just play it like on the Commodore 64 like it originally was but new game modes

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.420
so

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.900
All right, I'm totally buying it for the Wii. I'm looking forward to this game so much

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:39.580
Did they ever say if this is coming to the u.s.. For sure because I know this is coming to

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:45.660
Europe and I can see the box art has the Europe ratings on it, but did they ever say they confirm this for the u.s.

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:51.020
Oh, well, I know the same company is putting out elevator action, and that's coming to the u.s.. So we're probably it is

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:55.100
I hope so I hope so system 8 or whatever we should call them and get an interview

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:58.180
I'm gonna do that system 3 system 3 sorry

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.540
I don't know why I thought this is me system 3

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.740
I'm gonna call them try to get an interview and beg and plead for impossible mission like a sad little fanboy

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.660
Well

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:13.020
Speaking of a sad little fanboys, but nothing actually having to do with sad little fanboys

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:17.020
Um guess what is coming out to the Wii? Thanks to the Vendee?

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.580
we are getting Scarface and

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:24.820
Which is kind of funny because you know with the game that it being you're actually gonna be using

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:33.300
The nunchuck to walk to drive to walk around to pilot boats, and you shoot using the wiimote and

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:38.740
You even have a chainsaw for hand-to-hand combat, so you have to wiggle it around and all that

01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:44.780
But um we're on the ps2 and Xbox ones you had to swear to increase your kill factor

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:48.140
You do it by making dirty gestures with your wiimote

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:53.520
The more you gesture the more your kill factor goes up hot sluts yes or no

01:12:53.520 --> 01:13:00.100
I see nothing regarding hot sluts there are hot but the game good the guy will take place after the final

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.940
mansion shootout

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:09.380
Um OMG spoilers, oh come on the movies from 1983 Rob

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:17.460
It's basically he doesn't die and he has to re instead he has to reclaim his fortune wait

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:22.100
He dies at the end. Yes. He dies at the end of the movie. Oh great next thing

01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.580
I know you're gonna. Tell me that like freakin Darth Vader's father Tony

01:13:26.780 --> 01:13:31.040
You tell me like freakin you know the Titanic sinks in that movie

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.620
I mean, what else do you want to ruin for me while you're here?

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.540
I'm sorry I have to kick somebody out of chair room

01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:46.260
Is somebody being bad, I don't know somebody's being punished. I told Nintendo maniac 64 not to use the

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:54.580
The what you're listening to shit in the chair really that stuff annoys yeah, so next next time is gonna be a ban

01:13:54.580 --> 01:14:01.820
So regularly yep, I don't care who it is. We have rules for what if I'm listening to hot sluts porn I don't care

01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:05.960
No one gives a shit about what anybody else is listening to he's supposed to be listening to the show

01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:10.740
All right anyhow anything else on Scarface you want to add um

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:16.420
No all right anyways, there's speaking of game Nate kills Tony

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:23.220
Speaking of games on the Wii there is a trend that we're gonna start seeing much like we did yes where

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:30.220
Companies go hey, we're making games for the Wii too, and then you're like well. What games do you have and they're like well?

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:38.960
Yeah, they're they're awesome games. I'm sure you've heard of them anyways one such company is this company called Metro and

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:46.980
Yes Metro or I guess data design interactive they are putting out some

01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:52.540
Any crappy games including such wonderful hits as

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:58.380
Action girls, and yes, they have every ethnicity on the front cover of that one

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:04.040
Ninja-bread man, which kind of looks funny dude Ninja bread man sounds awesome

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:11.700
Talking about crap games this sounds great monster trucks extreme trucks spell trux of course

01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:19.220
And oh god. I can't even Jamie isn't that one of your favorite things ever when they purposefully missed like Bratz BRATZ

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.620
That's retarded. Oh, it's monster trucks extreme

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:26.900
Off-road edition because I guess the last game was on road

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:32.100
Not like is that related to Big Mother truck us. No. It's probably just a crappy game

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:35.060
Anubis 2

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:38.140
Rock and roll adventures

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:44.100
Hamster yeah, that's like rock and roll high school. I'm so there no. It's not a hamster heroes

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.360
How can you call these bad games hamster heroes that sounds amazing?

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.500
mini desktop racing

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.200
These will be the people to put out laser cats

01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:02.180
Trixie in Toyland London taxi rush hour, and let's see what else we had it Billy the wizard

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:09.500
I can't even read what that said. It was I think it's like fucking Oh rocket broomstick racing and

Well, we could check out send them an email Loki get a touch with also tell them we will promote hamster heroes

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:35.960
You're on the program and ninja bread man. I like hamsters

But you know I I don't know if that games gonna be any good and who gives a shit

They're putting out chicken shoot on fucking you know the Wii so you know what I think it's

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:51.260
Only fair that they're allowed to put these games up just all you have to do

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:58.340
You monster trucks extreme at least better than monster 4x4 world circuit because that game was atrocious

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:02.380
Fireboma says rocket broomstick racing sounds like quidditch, but worse

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:07.780
To which somebody else had a follow-up speaking of spoilers because you're talking about spoilers in the last one

01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:13.960
GS68 had a comment for Dark Sakura GS68 has figured out who will die in book 7

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:19.580
Harry and Nintendo maniac 64 so he posted that spoiler there in chat, okay?

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.580
and

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:25.980
Let's see well apparently there was a laser cats to on last night on

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:33.020
The old Saturday night live just me it was laser cats to remember it was always laser cats to maybe it was a rerun then

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.360
I don't know

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.020
Anyway, let's see what else was there

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.460
Fire Boma says rock and roll high school sounds like a porno

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:46.400
Solid goomba says hamsters are proof. God loves us now now the website

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:50.780
I agree to be fair the company data design interactive to be fair

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:57.020
They did put out earache extreme metal racing which apparently is a pretty cool game

01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:01.140
I mean it mixes heavy metal with racing so these guys sound like

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:09.340
Modern-day genius says they know the types of games people want who doesn't want Ninja bread man. It's just I don't know

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:13.260
Please explain to me. How this could possibly be a bad thing

01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:16.980
They're in the UK so I mean that's even better

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:20.300
Now Jamie's gonna want him to

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:26.300
We can talk no one can contact their projects director. The hamster thing just sounds dirty I

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.220
Want them on the show I will do whatever it takes

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.580
Anyhow um I?

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:39.340
Think this is interesting and this is one group that will not be playing

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:44.340
Any of these games on the Wii anytime soon? What's basically going on? Is that?

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:46.060
There's this

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:53.380
Christian group and they call themselves the porn talk which is backed by basically a faith-based ministry

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:57.940
They've started a website that basically says has this huge banner on it

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:03.140
And it says we have a porn problem porn safety facts for Nintendo's

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:05.460
Wii gaming console if you want to visit the site

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:09.620
it's the porn talk calm and actually I looked at the site earlier and

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:17.260
You know basically they're just trying to prevent children from seeing pornography like did you know that?

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:22.100
You know there could be pornography hidden away and all these things we need to keep kids away from porn

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:28.100
There could be porn in your Wii because the Wii has access to the internet therefore there is porn I

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:33.900
Would like to also point out to the geniuses behind the porn talk calm that the computers you use

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:40.300
That the computers you used to make the porn talk calm that you're urging your kids to go check out to keep them away from

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.260
Porn or what okay?

01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:43.020
I guess they're really not doing that but you're urging

01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:48.620
Parents to go check out to keep their kids away from porn that device can also be used to access porn

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:55.860
If your child has a cell phone that can be used to access or something funny to a dollar or what is it?

01:19:56.380 --> 01:20:00.620
395 that can be used to access porn at your local

01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:04.100
Is somebody fucking racing outside? That's why I don't like having the window open.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.100
In your apartment complex.

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.860
Anyways, I gotta I gotta add this real quick. Yeah

01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:12.820
Now imagine if you will they tell them yeah, go to that porn talk site

01:20:12.820 --> 01:20:16.780
They'll teach you how to you know prevent you know seeing porn and stuff, okay?

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:22.160
They don't remember what the website name was so they search for porn talk boom porn there you go

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.860
they've been they've been uh

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:31.620
The porn beat them to the website, so I don't know they're bragging on their site that porn

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:36.100
Talk won best in show at the Addy Awards and all this. What the fuck's the Addy Award?

01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:42.100
I don't know who cares. It's the award show where we invited just us and we won because we're awesome

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:47.180
We've been taking we've been talking about the Wii and Wi-Fi devices on the porn talk blog

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:53.420
We'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this issue and your suggestions on dealing with devices that come with internet capabilities

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:57.300
They should be banning PCs next then in a max, and you know

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:01.000
Your cell phone why don't you crawl into a cave?

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:06.780
I'm just looking at some interesting comments on the actual site itself. I figure there's these comments are posted publicly

01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.780
There's no problem with me reading them on air correct

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:12.780
Ray said I'm all for talking to your kids about porn

01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:17.860
But the porn talk calm goes a little overboard using filtering software on your 17 year old is a little outrageous

01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:22.220
He or she will be in college the next year. Do you really want them so sheltered?

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:27.820
They'll go crazy not to mention the chances are your 17 year old will know a lot more about computers than you and will have

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:34.100
No problem getting any content. They want in related news. Ray is the olr not listener of the week

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.020
Common-sense people fucking use it

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:49.600
And you know there are ways to block the internet for your new children, I don't download the thing

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:56.040
There you go, but of course that would involve the parents being involved so

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.840
Yeah, that's not going to ever happen. That's never going to work

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:08.280
I mean come on gs68 makes an excellent point in chat gs68 over at chat dot orange launch radio com says women have boobs

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.740
Women are Gateway to porn

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:16.160
There you go. It's all women's fault. What do you think about that dark soccer? Oh, yes boobs

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.840
Oh, it's so all of our fault. You know and while they're at it

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:25.840
You know how about you know putting live birth on TV too because that you know that shows off the coochie

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:30.700
Or well don't they already have to show the miracle of life as part of like education and schools

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.120
Not if you live in Alabama

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:37.920
I was well that was a gateway to pornography the minute the minute I saw a baby flying out of that woman's vagina

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.640
I knew I never ever wanted to touch one

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:45.040
a health ed made you gay

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:50.000
Yeah, yeah sex education made me gay

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:58.120
I think I don't know anyway obviously stories about these you know crazy people who you know go oMG porn and have these you know

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:17.200
Hair trigger reaction to this kind of crap get us angry and when we get angry. It's time for our f us of the week

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:23.200
My F of the week goes towards people who say you're not so-and-so, so you don't know

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.480
Like you're not a parent. So you have no right to talk about children. Um

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:35.160
No, I'm intelligent. I have a brain. I'm observant. I've had little brothers as

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:40.400
A human being and as a woman who may one day give birth to children

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:47.040
Shiver not you just the baby flying out of your vagina I

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:54.920
Think that that completely discounts anything that you have to say when people start off with you don't know

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.080
Because you are not you know

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:04.040
That instantly removes all credibility from any argument that you might have by it because you're trying to immediately dismiss the other party

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:09.240
That doesn't put you in a superior position that puts you in a position of ignorance fucking shut your mouth

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.200
I'm done

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:18.760
Loki um, I guess f you the apartment complex for not actually having lines in the parking lot

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:21.560
So everyone has to kind of guess to where the cars are supposed to be

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.400
So that kind of sucks and have have you noticed that none of these blogs that point out, you know

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:31.600
The porn on the psp and porn on the we and stuff. Nobody's talking about the PlayStation 3

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:35.000
At all one owns a PlayStation 3

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.400
Exactly. So more porn for me and in high definition. So hell yeah

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:50.240
The Rob D in chat says I like how sky takes it sound like vaginas or rocket launchers in a way they kind of are

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.720
Right, Jamie

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:54.840
No

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.840
All right. Anyhow

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:01.800
My F you at the week goes to lack of sleep because I swear like every night this week

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:05.520
I got maybe four hours of sleep at the most of court granted. That's my own damn ball

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:11.200
I know it's the go to bed early Rob. Well, you know, there's Beth. There's there's such good TV on at 2 in the morning

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:17.320
What can I say? No, you know for circumstance, so I was just exhausted yesterday when Jamie and I were running around San Francisco yesterday

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.040
I was so tired. I thought I was gonna pass out

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:24.720
I slept for 11 hours last night, but I feel I feel pretty good today if a big groggy from oversleeping

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.920
so if you do lack of sleep and

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:32.120
And that's it rice princess left blank lanky style left

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:36.400
So we're the only ones in studio. So back to the gaming news then since there's no more F use of the week

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.240
Actually, I have one more F you of the week what I lied

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:42.920
Apparently, you know this fucking article. Okay?

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.000
alright, um

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.600
One of the major British driving schools BSM, which I immediately misread as BDSM

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:54.320
Took a survey. I misread it as BM and thought you

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:59.200
Took a survey of a thousand drivers between the ages of 16 to 24

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:05.560
About video games how it's affecting their driving habits and the results stated

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.560
27% admitted to taking more risks on the road after playing a racing game

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.160
And of course saying they pretend they're actually in a video game when they drive

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:21.400
They're saying that that's a an indisputable link between gaming and dangerous driving

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:23.400
Um

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:27.600
What they're not really paying attention to is that

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:34.680
If they're interviewing people between the ages of 16 and 24 chances are that your audience is not going to be very fucking mature

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.080
and

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:40.520
Not going to have the skill to know about you know

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.240
how to drive properly

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:50.920
It's you're dying to say something over there Loki they feel the mention is all those people that said they drive recklessly women

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.140
Of course then again. I mean I can't imagine too many of them actually twenty foot seven percent. Yeah, that sounds about right

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.680
I don't know

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.640
It doesn't matter anyways if even if they weren't playing video games. It's still be crashing this shit

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:09.680
I swear to God people talking on their cell phone drifting in and out of lanes Oh

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:15.820
Okay, the funniest thing happened to me today. I bought food. Oh my god

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:23.080
Meanwhile people are dying and just like totally oblivious to the fuck. How did I end up in this river?

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:26.960
They've totally jumped out in front of me. It's like I

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.720
think anything

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.760
that

01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:34.040
Has an effect on

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:38.920
Your react like if you have a predisposition toward anger or

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:43.760
Nervousness you're that's what's gonna. I think more effect. How you drive

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.600
Not so much the game. I mean

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:51.620
That's just that's really I mean even when I was a new driver

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:56.440
You know playing hard driving didn't make me want to go out and do a loop the loop on the road

01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:00.960
But then again hard driving you were driving super damn slow at least it felt slow in the game

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:04.760
It's not playing a driving video game that makes you want to drive fast

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.560
It's the fucking Wangan midnight maximum tune to soundtrack that makes me want to drive fast

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:17.360
Try and catch me now fucking coppers

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.840
exactly in the beat to be a little bit serious there I

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:28.680
Would think of anything playing video games would help you drive better because you're actually gonna have a faster reaction time

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:35.400
You know from games. They've actually helped you improve your reaction time a little bit. I would think so

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.500
Whatever it's a fucking survey survey suck

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.960
Survey says you say

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.440
So funny you shouldn't be playing

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:53.320
You know that kind of music, but uh Yuzo kashiro is gonna be DJing play

01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:57.300
Actually the concert in June

01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:02.280
They're going to be he's going to be DJing. I believe it's the concert in Japan. I know in

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.520
Singapore I better start driving to Singapore

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.400
Yes Rob drive to Singapore

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:19.400
Through the ocean that'll be awesome. I'll drive so fast. I'll float on the water come on

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:23.680
Right or maybe you'll just fart so hard you

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:25.680
Float over the water

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.520
But I thought that was pretty cool

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:33.360
And you know he's done such music from like you know streets of rage revenge of shinobi Actraiser

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.880
Castlevania portrait ruin

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.040
lots of stuff so

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:43.200
Gonna be spinning some tracks too bad. He's not coming over here. Just in Singapore ah

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:49.800
Bandit is my new best friend in chat if Sonic can do it. Why can't sky. Thank you very much

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:55.760
Sonic is a fictional blue hedgehog. I don't think hedgehogs move that fast anyways

01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:59.220
You're just pokey I

01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.040
Think it was irony or something

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:07.480
And hamster heroes is there a really is there a hamster that runs real fast

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:11.760
I think there's one that looks like Batman scary. Oh my god. This is the best game ever

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:20.040
Fucking hamsters have you ever had a hamster? Do you know I mean they in in grade school?

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:22.880
I just remember whenever like you go in the classroom that has a hamster

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:26.600
It smells like poop and they poop out pellets, which I always thought was amazing

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:31.720
Let me tell you a story about hamsters real quick. Hey hamsters are retarded. They're pretty real

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:36.840
The reason you would own a hamster is to watch how retarded it is I had a hamster

01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:43.200
We named him Sam because it was squeaks and moves. That's you know basically what stood for that's so creative anyways

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.760
So the hamster would spend hours

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:50.800
Doing this it would climb up the side of cage climb upside down

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:57.840
Fallen's head climb upside and just keep doing that over and over and over again. Well. You know why the hamster was so crazy

01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.840
Oh

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.760
I'll let the joke go now. Thank you anyways, but yeah one funny thing about hamsters

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:14.040
Oh, they actually throw their poop like footballs out of their cage

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:16.600
This is the Wii game

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:22.400
I want they sit there their feet fucking up in the air pull the poop out of their ass and they throw it

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:29.720
It is the weirdest thing to see but you guys don't understand why I'm laughing so hard

01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:32.960
Because thank God, this is a TV

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:36.600
But Loki actually put his feet up in the air

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.720
And reached

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:45.800
Rob's all red in the face of a horrible oh

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:50.300
My god. We need a TV show just for moments like that. We do

01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:51.620
we

01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:56.900
Have a hamster on the TV show, but a cape on maybe that should be our new mascot is a hamster

01:31:56.900 --> 01:32:01.700
They have a little bit about you too, so it's not worth it and every single one of them dies from cancer, so

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:04.660
not even worried

01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:09.540
Not even worth it of course all the chat rooms shouting hamster dance hamster dance

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:18.680
This is something that will make you dance the news that Raiden 4 is coming to the Xbox 360

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:26.400
Also, we're getting a localized version of Raiden 3 on the PlayStation 2, and that's coming from UFO interactive

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:35.480
And let's see that's coming out for $30 and that by the way originally showed up in Japan in September of 2005

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:38.200
So it's like one of those hey, it's about freaking time. We got that over here

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.560
It was supposed to come out last year around August as well

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:45.280
But then company it's which company excess game dropped it so yeah, whatever anyhow

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:50.800
I should be noted though that Raiden 4 is coming out on Xbox 360 for those of you unfamiliar with the franchise

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.320
It's just one of those shooter games that you know a lot of people love so

01:32:56.120 --> 01:33:00.560
There you go. I'm sure it's gonna be very pretty on the Xbox 360. I'm very excited about that

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:06.520
It is a it should be noted. It's a retail game not an Xbox Live arcade game, so that

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:11.340
Should tell you what you know they're going for here with that game should be fun

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:17.700
Well something that's not quite so fun. Though is that for everybody who is on the Metal Gear online?

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:20.220
All five of you. Hey

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:24.900
The the Metal Gear Solid 3 subsistence online servers

01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:30.740
Is a going bye-bye it as of April 2nd. It will be gone

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:34.460
The community is not big enough

01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:42.540
Community is not big enough now the user community for the game those who loyal to it are putting up internet petitions

01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:47.740
To try to keep it up, but it's in the category of not fucking lightly

01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:50.300
Sorry

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:54.340
Good luck if it works petitions don't usually magically fix everything

01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:59.060
But I know that's got to suck to get the plug pulled music game fans got amplitudes plug pulled on them a couple

01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:04.340
But but again an amplitude came out like five years ago, Metal Gear substance three subs

01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:09.240
Subsistence I can ever buy your go. Yeah, it's not that old is in March subsistence

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.540
I got it subsistence yeah, and to be honest it

01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:17.380
Just didn't sell that well and how many people use the online and this is what you get when you have you know fucking networks

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:21.380
That run by each individual company so one centralized network like live

01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:27.700
People start pulling servers because why bother paying for a server that you know no one's playing on so

01:34:27.700 --> 01:34:29.700
whatever

01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:35.100
But anyways so speaking of games that I think people are not really playing Phantasy Star Universe

01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:38.340
Oh, no, there's one girl on my friends list

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:43.340
That's always freaking playing Phantasy Star Universe that game has dropped down to 20 bucks now seriously

01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:49.620
It's not a bad game because the single-player mode is kind of fun, and you know it's like I see the online mode

01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:55.620
It's like a kind of free enhancement to it. It's not that bad. No, but it wasn't the magic didn't last long yeah

01:34:55.620 --> 01:35:01.820
um well Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion of the it's called the ambition of illuminus and

01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:08.180
There's going to be some pretty cool stuff as well. I think this has already come out in Japan

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:11.360
But they're going to be getting some new weapon types

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:18.060
including some photon whips and slicers new stages even a casino and

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:24.740
and um apparently the casino is run by penguin esque wrappies. Maybe I should go back to psu

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:29.480
That sounds neat. I like penguins. I like wrappies

01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:37.820
Your wrappies no if you if you've done the wrappy holiday quest you will never like wrappies again

01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:43.700
Which I believe is still going in the Phantasy star online or the old PSL

01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:49.060
I believe the Christmas quest is still going on the Xbox one as it has been for the past not 360

01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:55.980
But the rage it was going on blue burst for like six months. Yeah, seriously. Oh geez that's awesome

01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:58.240
They're all oh crap. We still have that game

01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:03.540
Hmm and for anyone who'd like to know I uh quit psu last week

01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:10.020
Congratulations. Yeah, this that goes to show just what my opinion of psu is so

01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:15.400
I've been playing world of warcraft, and I'm trying to get Jamie to join our

01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:20.660
Excuse me our little guild. We've got going on Ravencrest, so I think I talked her into it

01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:23.300
How about when I have time and when someone gets me burning crusade?

01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:26.060
All right, how about we take a break?

01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:31.420
We're gonna go to a breaks a break and when we come back. We'll have more of orange lounge radio more

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:36.060
Hilarious things coming out of Loki's mouth and other orifices probably

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:40.500
In the next part part B because we have a lot of 360 news we haven't gotten to yet

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:43.220
So we'll see you back in a little bit for orange lounge radio part B

01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:48.720
