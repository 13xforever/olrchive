WEBVTT

00:13.834 --> 00:19.304
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, March 4th, 2007, drama ensues over Sony's rumored PlayStation Home.

00:19.425 --> 00:26.318
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about who is starting an anti-Wii campaign, and the popular new computer game is rumored to be making a jump to Xbox Live.

00:32.188 --> 00:38.852
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet, on their iPods, their Zens, whatever devices you're using to listen to us.

00:38.892 --> 00:43.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe your Xbox 360, thanks to the 360 cast or whatever that thing was called.

00:43.735 --> 00:45.616
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:45.916 --> 00:49.639
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a show dedicated to video games and gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.

00:50.119 --> 00:54.842
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:55.042 --> 00:55.362
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo.

00:55.682 --> 00:57.103
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Mr. Jamie Summers?

00:58.604 --> 00:58.764
[SPEAKER_08]: Ow.

00:59.565 --> 00:59.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Ow?

00:59.745 --> 01:00.165
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong?

01:00.645 --> 01:01.166
[SPEAKER_03]: Your head hurt?

01:01.526 --> 01:01.686
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:02.062 --> 01:02.262
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:03.103 --> 01:03.743
[SPEAKER_08]: Female owl.

01:04.244 --> 01:04.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh.

01:05.405 --> 01:05.685
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

01:05.725 --> 01:07.186
[SPEAKER_03]: The TMI type of owl, huh?

01:07.407 --> 01:07.647
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:07.767 --> 01:08.327
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

01:08.728 --> 01:11.190
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure we'll have some extra special FUs tonight.

01:11.590 --> 01:11.830
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:12.130 --> 01:13.251
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, a good weekend.

01:13.271 --> 01:15.453
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie and I had a play day yesterday in San Francisco.

01:15.513 --> 01:16.014
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.

01:16.334 --> 01:16.854
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

01:16.874 --> 01:17.375
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good time.

01:18.116 --> 01:19.617
[SPEAKER_08]: And we both have really hot hair now.

01:20.077 --> 01:21.118
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we got our hair done.

01:21.438 --> 01:23.900
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first time I've ever paid $45 for a haircut.

01:24.361 --> 01:25.121
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks nice.

01:25.762 --> 01:26.202
[SPEAKER_08]: Be glad.

01:26.563 --> 01:28.764
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how much I pay for mine.

01:29.065 --> 01:30.446
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that a sexist thing?

01:31.369 --> 01:33.933
[SPEAKER_08]: I have more hair and I have more shit done to my hair.

01:34.033 --> 01:35.575
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I was a dude with long hair?

01:36.096 --> 01:36.897
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd probably charge you more.

01:37.117 --> 01:37.438
[SPEAKER_03]: You think?

01:37.798 --> 01:37.959
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

01:38.119 --> 01:41.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I would ever have long hair, but I've seen guys with longer hair than a lot of women I know.

01:41.904 --> 01:44.908
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like Marissa's boyfriend.

01:45.169 --> 01:45.930
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's true, yeah.

01:46.110 --> 01:47.212
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got gorgeous...

01:48.075 --> 01:49.836
[SPEAKER_08]: and gorgeous supermodel hair.

01:50.216 --> 01:56.660
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of, if I remember right, I think he chopped it off at one point, but remember Blue from DDR Freak, who's really into Pump It Up?

01:56.700 --> 01:57.661
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't he have kind of long hair?

01:57.721 --> 01:59.382
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, he almost had it in a ponytail, didn't he?

01:59.842 --> 02:01.163
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he had really, really long hair.

02:01.183 --> 02:02.584
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's who I kind of think of.

02:02.604 --> 02:03.104
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember him.

02:03.464 --> 02:05.305
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, say hello as well.

02:05.846 --> 02:11.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we talk about people who aren't here to defend themselves too much, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

02:12.450 --> 02:13.510
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm here.

02:13.951 --> 02:14.731
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

02:15.312 --> 02:15.952
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.

02:16.226 --> 02:22.447
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, I see you have not one, but two PSPs up and running with Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

02:22.467 --> 02:23.948
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you playing against yourself tonight?

02:23.968 --> 02:24.668
[SPEAKER_03]: What is going on here?

02:24.928 --> 02:26.908
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was just testing stuff.

02:27.008 --> 02:28.629
[SPEAKER_09]: He's playing with himself on live radio.

02:29.769 --> 02:31.369
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun, what types of things are you testing out?

02:32.469 --> 02:39.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Dark Galaxy's custom firmware, because it allowed me to run PS1 games on it.

02:41.818 --> 02:43.639
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:07.216 --> 03:08.496
[SPEAKER_03]: Such as I've done for the past three weeks.

03:08.516 --> 03:15.578
[SPEAKER_02]: So the custom firmware that I got, I got like a nice two gig memory stick so I can put, you know, PlayStation 1 games on there.

03:16.099 --> 03:21.020
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of what I was doing because I, you know, have this other PlayStation or PSP.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.801
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, what the hell am I going to do with this thing?

03:22.861 --> 03:27.542
[SPEAKER_02]: So load up a custom firmware and I can make it all pretty because you can edit all the icons.

03:27.562 --> 03:29.723
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add the waves in the background, everything.

03:30.063 --> 03:33.524
[SPEAKER_02]: And you run Homebrew off of a memory stick.

03:33.544 --> 03:34.244
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus you can run...

03:35.595 --> 03:39.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Programs that require firmware 3.10 or 3.03, I guess.

03:40.296 --> 03:42.057
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like the best of both worlds.

03:43.377 --> 03:45.018
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

03:45.318 --> 03:48.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Also joining us tonight, we don't have any other guests in studio.

03:48.319 --> 03:49.119
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a first.

03:49.179 --> 03:50.720
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had that in a long time.

03:50.820 --> 03:53.160
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be a relatively quiet show tonight.

03:53.200 --> 03:53.541
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

03:54.141 --> 03:54.481
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

03:54.801 --> 03:56.561
[SPEAKER_03]: The three of us will entertain you the best we can.

03:56.581 --> 04:01.463
[SPEAKER_03]: But, of course, we always have our invisible other guest with us every week, the chat room.

04:01.503 --> 04:04.244
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's accessible over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

04:05.390 --> 04:06.270
[SPEAKER_03]: XB Stream.

04:06.351 --> 04:09.732
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the name of the Xbox 360 program I was trying to think of at the beginning.

04:10.112 --> 04:11.753
[SPEAKER_03]: You can listen to us on XB Stream.

04:12.093 --> 04:13.614
[SPEAKER_03]: We're one of the default podcasts.

04:14.394 --> 04:15.154
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot about that.

04:15.214 --> 04:19.516
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to the XB Stream folks, and don't be too mad at me for forgetting your name.

04:20.477 --> 04:20.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

04:21.017 --> 04:22.198
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the chat room there.

04:22.878 --> 04:24.919
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Canogram says, the soundboard is cursed.

04:25.659 --> 04:26.840
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really use a soundboard.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.060
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just Winamp.

04:28.100 --> 04:28.941
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing too fancy.

04:29.241 --> 04:29.721
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Rob.

04:30.339 --> 04:30.799
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my fault.

04:30.999 --> 04:35.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, if I did switch to a soundboard, it would probably be easier, but I don't like the whole soundboard setup thing.

04:36.761 --> 04:41.003
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I feel like if I had a soundboard, I would use it far too much.

04:42.823 --> 04:48.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say there's other shows out there that do use it too much, but I'm just thinking that we'd probably use it too much.

04:49.486 --> 04:52.227
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaze says that's three weeks in a row they've effed up the soundboard.

04:52.267 --> 04:53.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, something like that.

04:53.807 --> 04:54.868
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't eff up anything.

04:54.968 --> 04:56.328
[SPEAKER_08]: I was sitting here in my chair.

04:58.249 --> 04:58.629
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting here.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.501
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Damani says, I got Crash Bandicoot on my PSP.

05:04.465 --> 05:06.607
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when Crash Bandicoot was cool?

05:06.787 --> 05:07.007
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

05:07.347 --> 05:10.190
[SPEAKER_03]: Before it went the way of Spyro and all those other franchises.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.831
[SPEAKER_03]: They just drove into the ground.

05:12.091 --> 05:13.293
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I never remember it being cool.

05:13.673 --> 05:14.734
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool at one point.

05:14.774 --> 05:16.896
[SPEAKER_03]: Crash Bandicoot 2 was the first PlayStation game I ever owned.

05:17.236 --> 05:18.737
[SPEAKER_09]: I never remember that game being cool.

05:18.818 --> 05:19.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whatever.

05:20.219 --> 05:20.619
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

05:21.620 --> 05:22.221
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is here?

05:22.421 --> 05:25.784
[SPEAKER_03]: Firebomba says, anyway, anyone here play Magic?

05:26.997 --> 05:30.518
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't since I was in college the first time around.

05:30.798 --> 05:36.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I sold my deck when I was a junior in high school, which was a long time ago, over 10 years ago, if you can believe it.

05:37.340 --> 05:38.481
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's still going strong.

05:38.541 --> 05:39.981
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the old computer game.

05:40.201 --> 05:43.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the one you could play online, but the very first computer game that ever came out.

05:43.822 --> 05:44.603
[SPEAKER_03]: I really liked that.

05:44.703 --> 05:47.964
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember you walked around a map and battled other people.

05:47.984 --> 05:49.964
[SPEAKER_03]: I should try and find that and play it again.

05:50.024 --> 05:54.946
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of fun, but I don't think they really make it anymore because didn't they go online with it?

05:55.518 --> 06:01.420
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt says, I remember the old Crash commercials where he would always cause trouble outside of Nintendo.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.201
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that as well.

06:03.221 --> 06:04.862
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

06:04.922 --> 06:07.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, also, RK1HexAugust31st wants to know,

06:21.006 --> 06:22.987
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the part where you call out the noobs?

06:23.268 --> 06:24.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, alright, we can do that.

06:24.408 --> 06:25.669
[SPEAKER_03]: The noobs in chat tonight.

06:25.969 --> 06:28.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I don't rec- again, I'm going off memory.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.992
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you may have to help me if you don't recognize any of these names.

06:31.252 --> 06:33.654
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, well, first off, that name I just named is new.

06:33.914 --> 06:35.555
[SPEAKER_03]: RK1HexOg31.

06:36.295 --> 06:36.655
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

06:37.456 --> 06:38.736
[SPEAKER_03]: Broodwitch, I think, is new.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Alistar, I recognize from our World of Warcraft guild.

06:42.218 --> 06:42.559
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

06:42.579 --> 06:44.580
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, who else is new?

06:44.980 --> 06:46.361
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I recognize any other new names.

06:47.702 --> 06:48.282
[SPEAKER_03]: Jodrew?

06:48.362 --> 06:49.183
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we had that before?

06:49.223 --> 06:49.863
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be new, too.

06:50.501 --> 06:50.581
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

06:50.601 --> 06:50.641
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

07:19.099 --> 07:20.540
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Metroid.

07:20.560 --> 07:26.444
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I know you're really, well, then you should really like Castlevania Symphony of the Night because it ripped off Metroid in many ways, but that's what made it so great.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.826
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to kick DM in too, just because.

07:28.906 --> 07:29.366
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, do it.

07:29.386 --> 07:31.247
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I going to say?

07:31.687 --> 07:35.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Rondo of Blood you love, but Symphony of the Night was kind of in some ways a sequel to Rondo of Blood.

07:35.630 --> 07:36.891
[SPEAKER_03]: You love Symphony of the Night a lot, right?

07:38.812 --> 07:40.773
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was a sequel to Rondo of Blood.

07:40.854 --> 07:40.994
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

07:41.094 --> 07:44.496
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to play it on Xbox Live Arcade?

07:45.126 --> 07:47.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you going to say, eh, why should I download this?

07:47.547 --> 07:50.389
[SPEAKER_03]: I already have the PlayStation and Saturn and whatever else.

07:50.869 --> 07:55.992
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't really have a need to because I do have the other versions.

07:57.853 --> 08:02.456
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, to this one's credit, it'll be... If it's the Saturn version, hell yeah.

08:02.836 --> 08:03.337
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it won't be.

08:03.437 --> 08:03.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, no.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.098
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be enabled for your HDTV.

08:06.238 --> 08:12.682
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, it's got the stupid stagnant graphics on the side, but at least you won't have to worry about altering your TV settings or any of that stuff.

08:13.220 --> 08:13.480
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

08:41.377 --> 08:43.538
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

09:01.879 --> 09:03.600
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually is a really good game.

09:03.660 --> 09:04.300
[SPEAKER_08]: It's surprising.

09:04.380 --> 09:07.022
[SPEAKER_08]: Although the PS3 version, it obviously is just a port.

09:07.643 --> 09:09.124
[SPEAKER_08]: Because nothing is prettier.

09:09.444 --> 09:11.165
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, it's really pretty.

09:11.806 --> 09:14.908
[SPEAKER_08]: The gameplay itself, but the cinemas are not touched up for it.

09:15.388 --> 09:20.892
[SPEAKER_08]: But the only complaint I really have with that game is the camera sometimes getting a little bit weird.

09:21.773 --> 09:24.935
[SPEAKER_08]: And the boss is in the Atlantis level right now.

09:25.695 --> 09:26.476
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was really cool.

09:26.496 --> 09:29.118
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, dude, what the hell is Mysterio doing here?

09:30.110 --> 09:34.715
[SPEAKER_08]: I've determined that playing as Elektra sucks, but playing as Captain America is fucking awesome.

09:35.155 --> 09:38.238
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he throws the shield and it bounces off the walls while you beat other stuff up.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.201
[SPEAKER_08]: And then right when they're about to hit you, it bounces them in the head.

09:41.261 --> 09:44.464
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you remember it was kind of that way in an old arcade game.

09:44.504 --> 09:48.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they have an old arcade Marvel game that you could play that was very similar?

09:48.208 --> 09:49.369
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there was the Avengers game.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.952
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just one of those little side-scrolling games.

09:51.972 --> 09:52.252
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.119
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to remember S.H.I.E.L.D.

09:54.159 --> 09:55.760
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of did the same thing where it bounced around.

09:55.820 --> 09:56.880
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, Captain America's awesome.

09:57.160 --> 09:57.620
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

09:57.801 --> 09:59.761
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a mild obsession with Captain America right now.

10:00.121 --> 10:02.642
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, SSJ100, Matt and his Marvel does rock.

10:03.422 --> 10:08.024
[SPEAKER_08]: Except I've decided that who rocks more than she does in that game is Spider-Woman.

10:09.204 --> 10:15.766
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that maybe don't follow comic books as heavily as you do, because I know you're a bit of a comic fangirl, but maybe, you know, I...

10:16.556 --> 10:17.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

10:29.795 --> 10:38.337
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you have to really follow, I mean, there's so much fun fan stuff thrown in that I think it's really great, but I don't think you really need to be a big fan of, you know, Marvel Comics to get into the game.

10:38.757 --> 10:52.500
[SPEAKER_08]: It does follow the established Marvel Universe, although for some weird reason, like a couple of the characters are in their Ultimate costumes, but I quickly went and changed all of them back to their regular Universe ones, but it was pretty cool.

10:53.321 --> 10:55.201
[SPEAKER_08]: That has Nick Fury in it, and he's awesome.

10:55.999 --> 10:56.620
[SPEAKER_08]: DC Comics Superman

11:21.621 --> 11:22.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Batman, too, right?

11:22.502 --> 11:22.862
[SPEAKER_03]: Batman.

11:23.843 --> 11:28.165
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the X-Men and I love the Avengers, except for Iron Man because he's an asshole right now.

11:28.786 --> 11:30.087
[SPEAKER_08]: But I really like Captain America.

11:30.767 --> 11:31.067
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

11:31.628 --> 11:31.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.769
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at chat room to see some other comics here.

11:35.951 --> 11:38.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks in there are explaining their gaming week.

11:38.672 --> 11:41.374
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I see Brad saying DC Universe beats Marvel every day.

11:41.454 --> 11:41.775
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

11:43.616 --> 11:44.256
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is there?

11:45.417 --> 11:46.618
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks have been playing Crackdown.

11:46.638 --> 11:48.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a lot of people playing Crackdown this week.

11:48.953 --> 11:49.554
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw X-Men Arcade

12:06.084 --> 12:07.065
[SPEAKER_03]: I walked off the screen, aww

12:34.912 --> 12:38.794
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm assuming DarkSakura is done, so Loki, how was your gaming week?

12:39.074 --> 12:39.914
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.655
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Crackdown a lot.

12:42.795 --> 12:46.837
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually finished the game, but I'm getting those last few achievements.

12:46.877 --> 12:51.679
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I have everything maxed out except for firearms now, so I just have to max that out.

12:52.279 --> 12:55.060
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already at level 4 on it, but just, you know, almost there.

12:55.540 --> 13:00.122
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have to get the rest of the orbs and hidden orbs and all that stuff.

13:00.162 --> 13:03.984
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just working on the last few achievements, but I'm done with the game, so yay.

13:04.004 --> 13:04.084
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

13:04.628 --> 13:06.829
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, what else?

13:06.909 --> 13:08.249
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I played DDR Universe.

13:08.429 --> 13:09.029
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was okay.

13:09.249 --> 13:10.509
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for DDR, I guess.

13:10.629 --> 13:14.911
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got really uninterested after a while.

13:14.931 --> 13:16.671
[SPEAKER_02]: It took forever to unlock stuff.

13:16.711 --> 13:19.031
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of just, eh, don't care.

13:20.152 --> 13:21.392
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hate quest mode.

13:21.412 --> 13:22.212
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's retarded.

13:22.912 --> 13:26.193
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, the challenge mode is kind of cool.

13:26.353 --> 13:28.754
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wish it was stuck with, like, the...

13:29.813 --> 13:33.034
[SPEAKER_02]: Interstellar Master Mode Bullet Witch Everything bad you've heard about that game is true.

13:33.074 --> 13:33.514
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks balls.

13:51.587 --> 13:52.228
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really that bad.

13:52.408 --> 13:53.749
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly do you do in Bullet Witch?

13:53.789 --> 13:54.869
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it, but I don't know much about it.

13:54.890 --> 13:56.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Bullet Witch, you just go around killing things.

13:57.231 --> 13:58.973
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing that sucks about it... Like murder.

13:59.313 --> 14:06.598
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, murder is good, but the game itself, there's no lock-on for anything, and the enemies are really fucking easy.

14:06.838 --> 14:15.745
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, like I said, to be fair, I've only played it for a short amount of time, so I haven't really given it a fair shake yet, but from what I've seen so far, it doesn't look good.

14:15.825 --> 14:19.868
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a game that was like first-gen PlayStation 2 or something.

14:20.008 --> 14:20.829
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really...

14:22.631 --> 14:27.153
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it just didn't feel very cool or anything, but, you know, whatever.

14:27.713 --> 14:37.396
[SPEAKER_02]: So, gave it a shot, and then I played the Armored Core 4 demo, um, that's out in Japan right now, and that one is awesome, and I can't wait to pick up the full game.

14:37.676 --> 14:39.316
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot faster than Chromehounds.

14:39.356 --> 14:44.678
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were turned off by Chromehounds, this might be the game for you, because it's a lot faster.

14:45.198 --> 14:49.360
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's three fucking buttons for, you know, boost in the game, so, I mean, you gotta love that.

14:50.020 --> 14:50.500
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um,

14:51.465 --> 14:52.105
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just pretty cool.

14:52.526 --> 14:52.926
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

14:53.326 --> 14:58.610
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it was in Japanese, so I didn't really know what they wanted me to do, but it was fun blowing up things.

14:59.011 --> 15:00.572
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really looking forward to that.

15:01.572 --> 15:05.375
[SPEAKER_02]: And... I think that's pretty much all I played this week.

15:05.996 --> 15:07.277
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, lots of Crackdown, though.

15:07.377 --> 15:10.619
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to play some co-op so I can get that last co-op achievement.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.342
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um... Oh, there's some fun things to do in Crackdown.

15:14.362 --> 15:16.603
[SPEAKER_02]: We were messing around with stuff.

15:17.324 --> 15:18.064
[SPEAKER_02]: Driving the...

15:19.452 --> 15:24.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Semi-truck round and just boosting through pedestrians like crazy was fun.

15:24.976 --> 15:26.557
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing hundreds and hundreds of people.

15:26.857 --> 15:32.701
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually level up your driving pretty fast that way because you end up killing more bad guys than you do the actual pedestrians.

15:33.701 --> 15:33.981
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

15:34.702 --> 15:36.003
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

15:36.943 --> 15:40.065
[SPEAKER_03]: I also played a little bit of Crackdown this week, but not enough to really review the game.

15:40.405 --> 15:44.448
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's odd because I don't really get into those types of games like Crackdown or Grand Theft Auto.

15:44.468 --> 15:45.969
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're kind of fun for five minutes, but

15:46.288 --> 15:49.272
[SPEAKER_03]: When I try to play the story mode, I don't really get into them as much.

15:49.332 --> 15:59.944
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't really give the game a fair review yet, but I'm going to force myself to play a little more and try to look at it a little more from the perspective of, well, okay, I realize I'm not a fan of this genre, but what my fans of the genre think of it.

16:00.885 --> 16:04.069
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm more excited about getting to play the Halo 3 beta finally, after all.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.672
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking forward to that as part of Crackdown.

16:07.110 --> 16:15.793
[SPEAKER_03]: GameTap gave this thing CPR recently and now it's up and running as of I think Valentine's Day or the day after is when they actually launched this so I went on there to check it out very much unlike any other MMO you've ever played in fact I

16:37.114 --> 16:45.838
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if it would be fair to call this game an MMO, because if you think this is going to be like a Warcrafty run quest, slash things, kill things, it's totally not like that.

16:45.938 --> 16:48.079
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to remember, Myst was not like that.

16:48.179 --> 16:48.900
[SPEAKER_03]: Myst was what?

16:48.960 --> 16:58.444
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a puzzle game where you didn't really know what the hell was going on, you just knew you had to do things to unlock the way, and as you explored, you figured out more of the story.

16:58.744 --> 17:00.625
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's exactly what Myst Online is.

17:00.685 --> 17:02.246
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game of exploration.

17:02.728 --> 17:03.469
[SPEAKER_03]: with other people.

17:03.849 --> 17:10.954
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of weird at first because my brain wasn't really thinking that was what I was getting into, although I should have known better because I played Myst back in the day.

17:11.255 --> 17:12.496
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'm thinking, oh, it's an MMO.

17:12.516 --> 17:13.596
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go around and kill things.

17:13.696 --> 17:14.817
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:15.077 --> 17:15.818
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing like that.

17:16.599 --> 17:16.739
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

17:17.899 --> 17:18.839
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

17:46.841 --> 17:47.662
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

18:09.232 --> 18:11.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Download times are atrocious.

18:12.193 --> 18:18.296
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, having to patch the game earlier in the week, there was no percentage bar or anything that showed me how long it was.

18:18.336 --> 18:20.156
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear, the game took like an hour to patch.

18:20.597 --> 18:29.340
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, when you try to access new areas in-game, it takes a long time to load up the new areas of the game, because sometimes it's like you're downloading them before you even go there.

18:29.360 --> 18:35.082
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand it's trying to download the world to my computer, but I kind of wish there was a little more forewarning or something.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.623
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally had to wait like 30 minutes before

18:37.025 --> 18:43.207
[SPEAKER_03]: for some new area to download, and I just bounced, like, from five, from spending, like, only five minutes in another place.

18:43.247 --> 18:48.529
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just kind of exploring, walking around, then suddenly, bam, I gotta wait 30 minutes with no real warning.

18:49.049 --> 18:50.709
[SPEAKER_03]: So the load times in the game I was not a fan of.

18:52.030 --> 18:59.953
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think, though, back to the positives, I think if you're the type of person that gets sucked into those, like, reality gaming things, what do they call those things?

19:00.013 --> 19:03.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the, uh, Loki, you're into AR, alternate universe games?

19:04.014 --> 19:04.414
[SPEAKER_03]: ARGs?

19:05.182 --> 19:05.462
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?

19:05.502 --> 19:07.244
[SPEAKER_02]: Alternate Reality Gaming, ARGs.

19:07.284 --> 19:08.364
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the popular ones?

19:10.106 --> 19:10.786
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

19:10.806 --> 19:16.911
[SPEAKER_02]: They had one for... Well, they have one right now for... It's not really an alternate reality game.

19:16.931 --> 19:20.573
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's more of a viral site or something, but... Sort of.

19:20.653 --> 19:23.416
[SPEAKER_02]: It's... What was it?

19:23.456 --> 19:26.878
[SPEAKER_02]: The... Primatechpaper.com or something like that.

19:26.898 --> 19:27.999
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for like heroes and stuff?

19:28.039 --> 19:28.579
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

19:28.619 --> 19:31.622
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, Myst is kind of something like that, but it's like... I mean, it's...

19:32.738 --> 19:35.480
[SPEAKER_02]: I love bees.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.321
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that might be a more viral site.

19:37.741 --> 19:43.444
[SPEAKER_03]: Myst Online really takes it to the next level because there are sites that are supposedly made by people in the cavern.

19:43.704 --> 19:54.990
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you're into role-playing a little bit, you'd really be into it because there's people that play IC in cavern, like they pretend that they really are in the cavern, and they really are exploring these worlds and kind of talk with that perspective.

19:55.170 --> 19:58.692
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's people that play OOC out of cavern and kind of talk like it's normal.

19:58.932 --> 20:00.853
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Myst Online guides give a real...

20:02.065 --> 20:03.706
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

20:29.938 --> 20:31.798
[SPEAKER_03]: by interacting with the real life actors.

20:32.078 --> 20:38.900
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do this orientation every hour, Monday through Friday from like, I don't know what it was, like 5 to 10, they do orientations every hour.

20:39.160 --> 20:47.481
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually went to one, and there was actually a guy there that kind of talked about what the universe was, and like I even, to make sure it wasn't a robot, I threw out a question and he actually answered it.

20:47.761 --> 20:51.262
[SPEAKER_03]: So like there were live people just kind of talking about the game and kind of took you on a tour of the main area.

20:51.602 --> 20:56.183
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, if you're really into those like alternate reality things, you're gonna get a kick out of it.

20:56.783 --> 20:57.823
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you are

20:58.610 --> 21:03.771
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a game where you quest, that has an objective, that has set goals and things you do?

21:04.111 --> 21:06.152
[SPEAKER_03]: Myst Online ain't going to be really feeling it for you.

21:06.212 --> 21:11.713
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't seem like you really interact with people a lot in the beginning.

21:11.793 --> 21:13.273
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something you kind of work towards.

21:13.533 --> 21:19.934
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, if you're a GameTap subscriber, obviously you're already paying for Myst Online, so go in there and look at it.

21:20.455 --> 21:21.035
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth it.

21:21.975 --> 21:22.755
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not...

21:24.071 --> 21:25.993
[SPEAKER_03]: Already a subscriber of GameTap.

21:26.153 --> 21:27.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it worth it just for Myst Online?

21:28.275 --> 21:28.795
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

21:28.935 --> 21:35.300
[SPEAKER_03]: You really need to check out the demo so you can kind of see for yourself what I'm talking about, that it's not your typical type of MMO, and make your decision from there.

21:35.461 --> 21:40.685
[SPEAKER_03]: I still recommend GameTap as a whole because, like, 800-something games for $9.95 a month, I think it's a great service.

21:41.506 --> 21:44.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I talk about it so well on the show you'd think I'm on their payroll, but I'm not.

21:44.408 --> 21:45.569
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a really great service.

21:45.969 --> 21:48.972
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, if you're a GameTap subscriber, go check it out.

21:49.272 --> 21:52.695
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're out of the country where you don't get GameTap and you're going to have to buy this game separately...

21:53.447 --> 21:53.688
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Universe

22:04.073 --> 22:07.075
[SPEAKER_03]: For the Xbox 360, there's a lot of very good things about Universe.

22:07.135 --> 22:08.776
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of very bad things about Universe.

22:09.256 --> 22:10.997
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ancestor Revolution Universe, the good things.

22:11.357 --> 22:12.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Song list, great.

22:13.018 --> 22:13.798
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the song list.

22:14.138 --> 22:15.519
[SPEAKER_03]: Graphics, pretty cool.

22:15.819 --> 22:17.380
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit vibrant.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.722
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to turn them down because they were a little too colorful, but the videos are very well done.

22:20.762 --> 22:21.222
[SPEAKER_03]: They're vibrant.

22:21.262 --> 22:24.164
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, the game is in HD, which gives the game a whole new look.

22:24.204 --> 22:24.864
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very cool.

22:25.364 --> 22:26.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Things I didn't like.

22:26.545 --> 22:28.626
[SPEAKER_03]: Quest Mode, Quest Mode, Quest Mode.

22:28.646 --> 22:30.246
[SPEAKER_03]: That mode is atrocious.

22:30.787 --> 22:33.928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the worst thing to ever happen to DDR since True Kiss Destination.

22:34.348 --> 22:34.988
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.389
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awful.

22:36.909 --> 22:38.469
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so awful.

22:38.549 --> 22:39.630
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even explain it.

22:39.730 --> 22:40.150
[SPEAKER_03]: It is like...

22:41.083 --> 23:06.174
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's no questing to it it's just it's like you go to a city and you fucking oh we need to get some fame play songs over and over and over there's no explanation it's poorly done it's basically the same five challenges over and over and they have to unlock things through this mode as a joke so if you're thinking that oh I'm gonna get a thousand easy points from DDR universe no you'll get about 400 from playing just just play each song once

23:06.550 --> 23:08.751
[SPEAKER_03]: but quest mode, it's not even worth it.

23:08.851 --> 23:11.312
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, wait and see if an unlock code is released.

23:11.332 --> 23:14.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Like remember Ultramix 2, like an unlock code came out later that would give you all the unlocks?

23:14.814 --> 23:15.475
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait for that.

23:15.855 --> 23:16.635
[SPEAKER_03]: See if something happens.

23:16.675 --> 23:19.577
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there is one or not, but hopefully there is because quest mode sucks.

23:20.177 --> 23:21.077
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not even worth it.

23:21.418 --> 23:36.205
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in other words, if you are buying this game as a single player who likes all that extra stuff inside DDR, the game itself is really solid, like the songs and the steps and everything, but if you're buying this for quest mode or

23:37.232 --> 23:39.794
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Live, which basically has all the modes we've seen before.

23:39.975 --> 23:41.336
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's really a whole lot else.

23:41.416 --> 23:42.737
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

23:42.777 --> 23:46.860
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're contemplating upgrading to Xbox 360 just for DDR, don't.

23:50.452 --> 24:18.214
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR is a very unique game and I think it's something you should check out and they made it very beginner friendly which I think is cool and other good things I should say about it real quick other good things is that you know again it's very beginner friendly it does have like the jukebox mode and the edit step and video mode which is kind of neat and again the song list is great the downloads are pretty cool yes they're already on the disc but honestly some of the ultra mixes were done the same way it's you know something extra it's not essential to the gameplay but

24:18.761 --> 24:22.403
[SPEAKER_03]: and the basic game itself is fine.

24:23.724 --> 24:30.508
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, some of those other things like just the fact that the frame rate is still a little buggy.

24:31.048 --> 24:34.950
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, Cowboy Emmy has her head on backwards when you play in certain songs.

24:35.150 --> 24:35.951
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out for yourself.

24:35.991 --> 24:36.611
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not joking.

24:38.672 --> 24:42.634
[SPEAKER_03]: For a DDR hardcore fan, there's going to be some things in here that really irk you.

24:43.014 --> 24:45.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my thing that pissed me off, and I don't know if you noticed it.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.557
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have trouble playing on a controller?

24:48.322 --> 24:49.903
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

25:17.506 --> 25:18.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is stupid.

25:19.006 --> 25:19.366
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

25:20.747 --> 25:21.027
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

25:21.407 --> 25:22.727
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I don't know.

25:23.207 --> 25:28.869
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I do think DDR Universe is a good DDR game because essentially, what does DDR end up being?

25:29.049 --> 25:30.649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the songs and the steps.

25:30.869 --> 25:34.230
[SPEAKER_03]: And DDR delivers on some awesome songs and great steps.

25:34.530 --> 25:36.651
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other stuff kind of built around it?

25:37.571 --> 25:38.131
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so great.

25:38.471 --> 25:40.292
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really hope they patch it up with Universe 2.

25:41.076 --> 25:43.678
[SPEAKER_03]: LankyStyle, do you want to be on the radio tonight?

25:43.698 --> 25:43.758
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

26:08.686 --> 26:10.927
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, tell us about your gaming week anyway, because you're here.

26:11.547 --> 26:13.248
[SPEAKER_03]: With your freshly shaved head, I notice.

26:13.508 --> 26:14.429
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

26:14.509 --> 26:15.149
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that about?

26:15.589 --> 26:17.570
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I, Britney Spears.

26:17.590 --> 26:18.650
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was going to say Britney Spears.

26:18.670 --> 26:20.471
[SPEAKER_01]: Britney Spears did it, and I love her.

26:21.692 --> 26:22.712
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do the spider with her.

26:23.032 --> 26:23.292
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

26:24.413 --> 26:25.914
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's not explain what that is.

26:26.234 --> 26:26.974
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

26:27.834 --> 26:29.115
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, pretty good.

26:29.275 --> 26:36.918
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy VI for the GBA, and just dual wielding the Final Fantasies, because that's what I do.

26:37.839 --> 26:38.219
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh,

26:39.039 --> 26:39.479
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

26:40.340 --> 26:42.441
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have any of the new systems because I'm old school.

26:43.822 --> 26:46.404
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did play DR Universe, which is pretty cool.

26:46.785 --> 26:52.929
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the license tracks on it, but the old school tracks that they pulled back, that they brought back, I don't know.

26:53.269 --> 26:54.730
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was the best selection.

26:54.770 --> 26:57.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they've kind of already pulled a lot back in the other Xbox games, right?

26:58.033 --> 26:58.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

26:58.593 --> 27:00.515
[SPEAKER_03]: So they kind of, you know, they didn't want to repeat, so.

27:00.795 --> 27:01.215
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

27:01.235 --> 27:03.777
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was kind of cool they got Hot Limit back.

27:04.437 --> 27:05.678
[SPEAKER_01]: Eh, gay.

27:07.780 --> 27:08.020
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

27:09.272 --> 27:13.495
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, going to chat, I'm trying to see what's being talked about previously there.

27:14.535 --> 27:21.119
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people were kind of taken back by the True Kiss Destination, or True Kiss TKD reference I made earlier in the show.

27:22.139 --> 27:25.541
[SPEAKER_03]: And then somebody had to explain the DDR games that only came out in Japan.

27:27.802 --> 27:31.264
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, it looks like there's controversy brewing over Rondo of Blood in chat.

27:33.745 --> 27:34.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.859
[SPEAKER_03]: Firebomb wants to know, why do I keep hearing aim noises in the background?

27:37.879 --> 27:40.121
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Jamie's chatting while the show's going on.

27:42.063 --> 27:42.824
[SPEAKER_03]: You got busted.

27:43.605 --> 27:49.231
[SPEAKER_08]: I always have it open just like for only one person who is listening to the show, by the way.

27:50.012 --> 27:52.014
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can keep in touch with Tiara.

27:52.034 --> 27:52.174
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

27:52.475 --> 27:52.755
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

27:53.820 --> 27:57.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty, well, now that we've gone over all our gaming weeks, we're going to start getting into some gaming news.

27:57.802 --> 27:59.522
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, some housekeeping.

28:00.403 --> 28:01.063
[SPEAKER_03]: Housekeeping this week.

28:01.083 --> 28:07.766
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, we want to say a big thank you and hug, hug, kiss, kiss to PSP Fanboy, who profiled us on their site this week.

28:08.766 --> 28:13.228
[SPEAKER_03]: They, you know, posted like, hey, this is a cool show that you should download.

28:13.428 --> 28:14.709
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's called RSS This.

28:15.242 --> 28:15.762
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:36.604 --> 28:48.288
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bad feeling this guy listened to the episode where if you go back a couple episodes, DarkSakura and Chris were making those jokes back at each other where DarkSakura and Chris were joking that they were going to go off and have sex.

28:51.049 --> 28:52.169
[SPEAKER_03]: So that made me kind of laugh.

28:52.749 --> 28:55.630
[SPEAKER_03]: So I replied and I was like, actually, she's married.

28:55.670 --> 28:56.611
[SPEAKER_03]: You may not have caught that.

28:56.651 --> 29:00.912
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have downloaded the show where she was flirting with lesbians.

29:01.232 --> 29:05.434
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's just a cool girl who doesn't really – sexuality is whatever.

29:05.934 --> 29:06.114
[SPEAKER_03]: So –

29:07.641 --> 29:08.062
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

29:08.562 --> 29:12.003
[SPEAKER_03]: So they corrected the thing, but they still liked the show.

29:13.004 --> 29:13.584
[SPEAKER_03]: I like boobs.

29:14.064 --> 29:15.365
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

29:15.385 --> 29:16.245
[SPEAKER_03]: You're cool.

29:16.805 --> 29:17.125
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

29:18.726 --> 29:24.068
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what it boils down to, it's not that you're necessarily straight or you're a lesbian.

29:24.288 --> 29:25.008
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just a slut.

29:25.509 --> 29:26.009
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not.

29:26.149 --> 29:26.749
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

29:26.789 --> 29:27.129
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not.

29:27.269 --> 29:29.310
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only slept with one person ever.

29:29.770 --> 29:30.051
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

29:30.431 --> 29:31.611
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying this right now.

29:31.691 --> 29:33.532
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in a monogamous relationship.

29:34.133 --> 29:37.077
[SPEAKER_08]: with my very first and only Soha.

29:37.518 --> 29:39.220
[SPEAKER_03]: And you still can look at boobs.

29:39.240 --> 29:39.981
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with that.

29:40.001 --> 29:41.423
[SPEAKER_08]: Because boobs are hot and squishy.

29:41.563 --> 29:42.305
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

29:44.407 --> 29:44.668
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

29:45.068 --> 29:47.031
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, a couple other quick housekeeping things.

29:47.712 --> 29:51.177
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to point out over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com and our forums.

29:51.573 --> 29:54.297
[SPEAKER_03]: We've opened up our feedback threads a little early now.

29:54.617 --> 30:05.231
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way, those of you guys that are listening live, A, if you're too chicken to join the chat room at chat.orange.radio.com, you can post in our forum your live feedback as the show is going.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.996
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, it's a good way for folks that are listening live if they're in a chat room.

30:09.364 --> 30:14.186
[SPEAKER_03]: If they had a favorite topic or quote or some funny moment that they wanted to document, that can go in the thread.

30:14.206 --> 30:21.348
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really good in helping us to write our synopsis, what you guys liked, because then we kind of know what to feature in the show because you guys say you liked it.

30:21.408 --> 30:22.488
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a little thing there.

30:23.468 --> 30:24.649
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we want to mention this.

30:24.789 --> 30:29.790
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't directly have to do with us, but we're kind of throwing our support behind it, shall we say.

30:30.991 --> 30:35.412
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, if you didn't already know, Orange Lounge Radio is rebroadcast on a network called All Games.

30:35.802 --> 30:37.702
[SPEAKER_03]: All games is trying to build this community type thing.

31:03.458 --> 31:08.802
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like Myspace, but without the suck.

31:09.082 --> 31:13.024
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Myspace is as nice as it is, and you get a lot of attention there and everything.

31:13.344 --> 31:22.590
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with Myspace is that, I don't know about you guys, but I'm getting all these cam girls and sluts and hey, cam guys and everything that are trying to add me on there.

31:22.690 --> 31:26.893
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to filter out all this spam and crap to get through Myspace.

31:27.549 --> 31:35.095
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess all games found this other service called Ning that allows you to create your own social network without all the freaking ads and all that stuff.

31:35.475 --> 31:36.276
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty cool.

31:36.296 --> 31:42.660
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have your own blog on there and talk about stuff and then the blogs go to the front page and you can add your own videos and all that stuff.

31:42.680 --> 31:43.401
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty cool.

31:43.905 --> 31:44.565
[SPEAKER_03]: www.comunity.allgames.com

32:02.699 --> 32:04.280
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's it for housekeeping.

32:31.605 --> 32:33.326
[SPEAKER_03]: We will get into some game news now.

32:33.946 --> 32:35.027
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's starting us off tonight?

32:36.067 --> 32:37.868
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe that would be me.

32:38.608 --> 32:39.269
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

32:39.529 --> 32:45.051
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for all five of us who have PlayStation 3s, we have something to look forward to.

32:45.492 --> 32:56.157
[SPEAKER_08]: The firmware is being updated to 1.54 that will add a video chat feature so that we can, I guess, watch naked people and sweaty fanboys on the other side.

32:56.217 --> 32:59.018
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's our screen format, hey, that'd be great.

33:01.099 --> 33:18.272
[SPEAKER_08]: and if you've also, this of course is more going to go toward any of the UK listeners, but if you've imported your PS3, you'd go into the system menu and update via the internet or you can download the firmware from the US or Japanese support sites.

33:20.213 --> 33:21.834
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually have to pay 20 bucks for it.

33:23.275 --> 33:29.179
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, 20 bucks for Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection over in the UK, that would be $6.99.

33:31.369 --> 33:35.312
[SPEAKER_08]: and, um, that's really the only differences I'm seeing coming up with that.

33:35.693 --> 33:36.914
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't download that either.

33:37.494 --> 33:43.059
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, eh, no, 20, 20 some dollars is too much for me to pay for a game.

33:44.280 --> 33:45.160
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wait a minute.

33:45.180 --> 33:46.021
[SPEAKER_02]: That you download.

33:46.041 --> 33:52.426
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, you paid like 60 bucks for, yeah, but there's a big difference between like Tekken and Dig Dug.

33:52.606 --> 33:54.328
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also not a, I'm not a Tekken fan.

33:55.528 --> 33:56.168
[SPEAKER_02]: I would download it.

33:56.188 --> 33:58.890
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really a fighting game fan either.

33:58.910 --> 34:05.074
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Tekken is worth $600, which is essentially what you're going to try to sell me on because I still don't have a PlayStation 3.

34:05.895 --> 34:08.276
[SPEAKER_02]: And Flow, I still haven't gotten Flow.

34:08.296 --> 34:09.917
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I have trouble paying $8.

34:09.978 --> 34:11.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mean After Dark, the game?

34:12.099 --> 34:12.840
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

34:13.340 --> 34:14.761
[SPEAKER_03]: They should put toasters in there.

34:14.821 --> 34:15.762
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be even better.

34:15.882 --> 34:16.342
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be fun.

34:17.311 --> 34:18.272
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34:40.051 --> 34:42.732
[SPEAKER_03]: and put it on Xbox Live Market... Whoops.

34:43.052 --> 34:44.593
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Network.

34:45.033 --> 34:46.094
[SPEAKER_03]: See where my mind goes?

34:46.214 --> 34:48.215
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even realize there's a PlayStation Network.

34:48.495 --> 34:49.756
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have Lasers 3.

34:50.196 --> 34:53.197
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if Xbox beats them to it, that's the nail in Sony's coffin.

34:53.838 --> 34:55.318
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

34:55.398 --> 34:56.159
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a race now.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.479
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the real Next Gen Wars.

34:57.760 --> 35:00.081
[SPEAKER_03]: Who will obtain Laser Cats the game?

35:00.121 --> 35:03.022
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that will be the victor of the Next Gen Wars.

35:03.402 --> 35:07.985
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not necessarily adding lasers to cats is a good idea.

35:08.025 --> 35:08.885
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for example...

35:09.465 --> 35:10.646
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35:37.324 --> 35:40.507
[SPEAKER_02]: Future updates getting some upscaling for your DVDs.

35:40.787 --> 35:50.174
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is I think a feature that's already on the Xbox 360 and it's already on Blu-ray players out there.

35:50.194 --> 35:53.777
[SPEAKER_02]: At least some of the Sony ones and I think some of the other ones out there.

35:55.338 --> 35:57.860
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's something that's going to be coming later on.

35:58.000 --> 35:58.941
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know...

36:01.289 --> 36:03.070
[SPEAKER_02]: Normal DVDs upscaled look pretty good.

36:03.350 --> 36:07.972
[SPEAKER_02]: Not exactly going to be as great as content that was made for that resolution.

36:08.532 --> 36:10.233
[SPEAKER_02]: But, hey, something's better than nothing.

36:10.333 --> 36:12.694
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather have my DVDs look a little bit better.

36:14.655 --> 36:15.195
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

36:15.375 --> 36:17.856
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that's in the update other than video chat, because guess what?

36:17.956 --> 36:22.398
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any friends on the PlayStation Network, so video chat is kind of useless to me.

36:22.418 --> 36:24.039
[SPEAKER_03]: You have no friends on the PlayStation Network?

36:24.059 --> 36:25.779
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I have Bobby on there, and that's about it.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.940
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the only friend on my friends list.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.661
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Bobby's your only friend?

36:31.066 --> 36:35.809
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't even play online, really, with the PS3.

36:36.029 --> 36:39.991
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never played Resistance online, which I really need to do because it's supposed to be pretty good.

36:40.391 --> 36:48.656
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Motorstorm, which this week we're going to have that, and maybe I'll play that online, but Motorstorm is not two-player split-screen.

36:48.876 --> 36:49.816
[SPEAKER_02]: That fucking sucks.

36:50.437 --> 36:52.778
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hell can't they do split-screen games anymore?

36:53.556 --> 36:55.037
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just too graphic intensive?

36:55.057 --> 36:58.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're essentially having to render the two things at once.

36:58.780 --> 37:01.562
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would think that the cell processor could handle that.

37:01.762 --> 37:02.463
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

37:02.483 --> 37:03.343
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, shit.

37:03.924 --> 37:06.606
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be able to reconstruct my DNA.

37:06.806 --> 37:08.887
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the cell is awesome, right?

37:09.688 --> 37:11.869
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so upscaling DVDs.

37:12.750 --> 37:15.012
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the cell processor should be able to do that.

37:16.232 --> 37:16.573
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.

37:17.814 --> 37:18.114
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

37:19.034 --> 37:19.415
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

37:19.535 --> 37:22.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Going on to the chat room and kind of looking at what's going on in chat.

37:23.339 --> 37:23.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

37:24.619 --> 37:27.080
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD was correcting me from earlier and said it's actually not $600.

37:27.980 --> 37:30.400
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $599 US dollars.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.161
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, but you forgot tax and all that other crap they throw in there.

37:34.181 --> 37:34.161
$599.99.

37:35.101 --> 37:36.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

37:36.061 --> 37:36.481
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

37:37.101 --> 37:38.902
[SPEAKER_03]: HolyShonen says, Aw, poor Loki.

37:38.962 --> 37:40.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby, his only friend.

37:40.562 --> 37:43.463
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rama says, Loki is the Charlie Brown of Orange Lounge Radio.

37:43.483 --> 37:48.423
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to give out your username so that other listeners can take pity on you and you can have more than one friend?

37:48.583 --> 37:50.324
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just Loki space O-L-R.

37:50.724 --> 37:51.244
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

37:51.324 --> 37:51.464
[SPEAKER_02]: On the

37:52.783 --> 37:56.564
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's just no one has PlayStation 3s.

37:56.664 --> 37:57.304
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one.

37:57.704 --> 37:59.525
[SPEAKER_03]: Why aren't you guys friends?

37:59.985 --> 38:02.126
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you don't like Loki?

38:02.166 --> 38:04.066
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she doesn't play her PlayStation 3.

38:04.146 --> 38:04.826
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I do.

38:04.866 --> 38:05.947
[SPEAKER_08]: I played it all day today.

38:06.467 --> 38:07.967
[SPEAKER_02]: I sold one of my PlayStation 3 games.

38:08.007 --> 38:09.208
[SPEAKER_02]: I sold Full Auto 2 finally.

38:09.248 --> 38:12.248
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still keeping Ridge Racer 7 just for the fuck of it.

38:12.268 --> 38:13.489
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's Ridge Racer.

38:13.789 --> 38:14.389
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

38:15.149 --> 38:18.310
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ridge Racer 6 in new packaging for the PlayStation 3.

38:20.351 --> 38:21.651
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying Ridge Racer 8.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.089
[SPEAKER_02]: Hear me now, Namco.

38:24.310 --> 38:32.538
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to change more than just... Look, the cars are a little bit more shiny, and the tracks are a little bit more shiny.

38:32.618 --> 38:37.302
[SPEAKER_03]: What if Ridge Racer 8 allowed you to select Toons as the driving cat as a driver?

38:37.442 --> 38:38.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you then buy Ridge Racer 8?

38:39.244 --> 38:39.765
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wouldn't.

38:40.966 --> 38:44.850
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, if Ridge Racer 8 had tons of sluts everywhere, then maybe.

38:45.610 --> 38:46.171
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they'd need.

38:46.618 --> 38:48.038
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't rolling my eyes, I was popping my neck

39:07.971 --> 39:09.732
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, this is what they need.

39:09.932 --> 39:12.134
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Ridge Racer, it doesn't really stand out.

39:12.254 --> 39:12.814
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

39:13.394 --> 39:18.097
[SPEAKER_02]: Need for Speed and fucking Juiced and stuff are kind of getting a little bit better.

39:19.218 --> 39:22.880
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, more women could never hurt.

39:25.682 --> 39:28.584
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if there'd be anything in that for me.

39:29.464 --> 39:29.784
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

39:29.804 --> 39:30.605
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't play Ridge Racer.

39:31.841 --> 39:33.643
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireboma says Ridge Racer ate sluts everywhere

39:59.389 --> 40:01.651
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Canogram gives the mandatory LOL sluts.

40:02.993 --> 40:05.716
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says Ridge Racer Extreme Beach Volleyball.

40:06.196 --> 40:06.576
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

40:06.977 --> 40:10.320
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby Blackwolf just joined chat going, did someone say my name?

40:12.583 --> 40:17.888
[SPEAKER_03]: To which Rob D promptly responded, it's Loki's only friend, Blackwolf.

40:24.798 --> 40:29.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to put the patent down on this Ridge Racer 8?

40:30.439 --> 40:33.320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because they'll never do it.

40:34.320 --> 40:41.202
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still making weird... They still think that fucking Peanuts is a valuable franchise to them.

40:41.262 --> 40:42.182
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

40:46.363 --> 40:47.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I wanted to pull up here.

40:47.883 --> 40:52.364
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have... I overheard Blackwolf and...

40:53.254 --> 40:57.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki talking earlier, and I actually found the theme song of their relationship, so here it is.

40:59.858 --> 41:03.379
Haven't you ever heard this song in your life?

41:03.560 --> 41:04.140
Never mind.

41:04.280 --> 41:04.720
Okay.

41:04.820 --> 41:06.061
Joke gone wrong.

41:20.833 --> 41:27.795
[SPEAKER_03]: Also something that went way wrong earlier this week was the relationship between Kotaku and Sony.

41:27.855 --> 41:33.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely if you've been anywhere on the internet this week on game blogs you've heard about this whole fiasco.

41:33.797 --> 41:42.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically Kotaku published this rumor and the rumor is that PlayStation is going to be unveiling the PlayStation Home at Game Developers Conference.

41:43.909 --> 41:48.913
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you get to make an avatar for your console, like a Mii, and this avatar has a room.

41:49.353 --> 41:55.718
[SPEAKER_03]: As you play games and accomplish certain tasks, you will receive items with which to adorn the room that are specific to the game.

41:55.818 --> 41:56.318
[SPEAKER_03]: Achievements.

41:56.719 --> 42:00.142
[SPEAKER_03]: The kicker is that this is going to be a new requirement for every PlayStation 3 game.

42:01.102 --> 42:01.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome!

42:01.742 --> 42:03.463
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation is doing something right.

42:03.703 --> 42:07.785
[SPEAKER_03]: They are ripping off some of the best parts of Nintendo and Microsoft, which is what they need to do.

42:07.945 --> 42:08.526
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

42:08.646 --> 42:09.766
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody rips each other off.

42:10.006 --> 42:12.548
[SPEAKER_03]: They're ripping off the Wii's and Animal Crossing from Nintendo.

42:12.828 --> 42:17.910
[SPEAKER_03]: They're ripping off the achievements from Xbox 360 and making a more dynamic online service to compete with them.

42:18.390 --> 42:18.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Great!

42:19.031 --> 42:20.331
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds like a wonderful thing.

42:20.612 --> 42:22.172
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly this couldn't be bad press.

42:22.392 --> 42:24.093
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good news for Sony for once.

42:24.453 --> 42:25.354
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does Sony do?

42:25.854 --> 42:27.615
[SPEAKER_03]: They fuck it up with bad press.

42:28.311 --> 42:39.871
[SPEAKER_03]: because suddenly, like, not even five minutes after this rumor goes up, Kotaku gets this huge, you done fucked up letter from Sony, essentially, and so many, I don't have the letter in front of me, but essentially it said,

42:40.700 --> 42:50.423
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a bad person for running that story, therefore you're uninvited from our press conferences, we want you to send the dev kit back, we're slapping you on the wrist, blah blah blah.

42:50.503 --> 42:59.267
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the equivalent of playing Monopoly with somebody who's losing, and they throw the board up in the air and say, fuck this game, I'm taking my board home.

43:00.407 --> 43:01.767
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically what happened, yes?

43:01.827 --> 43:02.288
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair to say?

43:03.248 --> 43:08.830
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they're worried about negative press from the story, and yet...

43:10.282 --> 43:16.104
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this catches wildfire, you know, because everybody's like, what the hell did Kotaku do wrong?

43:16.424 --> 43:22.746
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only did they pretty much prove this rumor to be true, I mean, come on, is there any way this rumor could not be true?

43:22.866 --> 43:26.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that and the fact that they've also registered trademarks for PlayStation Homes.

43:31.178 --> 43:34.561
[SPEAKER_03]: All they had to do was just... We do not comment on rumors.

43:34.641 --> 43:39.706
[SPEAKER_03]: If Sony had kept their mouths shut, they could have still had somewhat of a surprise at Game Developers Conference.

43:39.967 --> 43:45.813
[SPEAKER_03]: But from this happening, did they not think, oh, well, if we're gonna, you know, slap Kotaku's wrist...

43:46.223 --> 43:49.605
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think they're probably going to blog about it since obviously Sony doesn't care about them anymore?

43:49.865 --> 43:52.286
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the other thing that I think is kind of bad.

43:52.446 --> 43:53.587
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me say real quick.

43:53.967 --> 43:57.189
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously the rest of the story is the rest of the internet banded behind Kotaku.

43:57.589 --> 43:58.489
[SPEAKER_03]: It got on Dig.

43:58.809 --> 44:05.653
[SPEAKER_03]: Even other blogs like Destructoid changed their title banner to basically say like Brian Crescente has the biggest balls in the world, something like that.

44:06.834 --> 44:15.378
[SPEAKER_03]: The entire internet's jumping behind what Kotaku did and Sony got its tail between its legs now, has to go

44:16.118 --> 44:17.679
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we made a mistake.

44:17.739 --> 44:19.140
[SPEAKER_03]: Kotaku, can we play nice again?

44:19.801 --> 44:21.042
[SPEAKER_02]: And they made up.

44:21.082 --> 44:21.802
[SPEAKER_02]: They kissed and made up.

44:22.022 --> 44:23.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the whole thing.

44:23.203 --> 44:25.605
[SPEAKER_02]: The big focus wasn't about this whole story.

44:25.785 --> 44:33.531
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that Sony was trying to dictate to a blog what stories they could post and what they can't.

44:33.811 --> 44:35.032
[SPEAKER_02]: They're reporting on stuff.

44:35.092 --> 44:35.512
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not...

44:36.397 --> 44:36.937
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

44:56.147 --> 44:57.448
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't quite go their way.

44:57.608 --> 45:03.511
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they thought, oh, big bad Sony's going to make a huff and puff and they're going to just be like, oh, okay, we'll take the story down then.

45:04.291 --> 45:08.314
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says, Sky, the whole Kotaku Sony thing was a damn publicity stunt.

45:09.114 --> 45:09.534
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

45:09.995 --> 45:10.295
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

45:10.715 --> 45:12.156
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the evidence to back that up?

45:12.256 --> 45:12.676
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

45:12.836 --> 45:13.857
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not publicity.

45:13.977 --> 45:15.818
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was just being stupid.

45:15.978 --> 45:22.621
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't Sony use their own, what is it, three, three something, what is that, three, that site they have.

45:22.681 --> 45:23.282
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called like 3D.

45:25.242 --> 45:27.424
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep thinking of Frogger 2, 3, Deep.

45:27.544 --> 45:28.165
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

45:28.445 --> 45:29.666
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have... Yes.

45:29.706 --> 45:30.107
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

45:30.127 --> 45:31.408
[SPEAKER_03]: Blog site's called Frogger 2, 3.

45:31.929 --> 45:33.170
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I have said anything more random?

45:33.390 --> 45:36.493
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some site, 3 something, that shows how much we care.

45:36.533 --> 45:36.853
[SPEAKER_03]: 3Play.

45:36.953 --> 45:37.294
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

45:37.854 --> 45:38.995
[SPEAKER_03]: You knew that the whole time.

45:39.056 --> 45:40.497
[SPEAKER_03]: You just wanted to watch me struggle.

45:41.238 --> 45:42.519
[SPEAKER_03]: They had 3Play or whatever.

45:42.830 --> 45:43.411
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help, I know...

46:08.719 --> 46:09.059
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

46:09.959 --> 46:11.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, I guess, that they're doing this.

46:11.940 --> 46:12.320
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.701
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to buy more games, though, because of it.

46:14.821 --> 46:15.301
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

46:15.961 --> 46:22.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft was smart to do the achievements because I'm a sucker and I buy crappy games like Bullet Witch because of this shit.

46:22.903 --> 46:28.065
[SPEAKER_02]: And no matter how hard I try, I can't do that because I'm hooked like crack.

46:28.645 --> 46:32.506
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the PlayStation Network or whatever, great.

46:32.606 --> 46:34.527
[SPEAKER_02]: I get crap for my virtual house now.

46:35.234 --> 46:36.014
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

46:36.314 --> 46:37.175
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show it to all my friends.

46:37.335 --> 46:37.715
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.

46:38.015 --> 46:40.956
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby is my only friend on there, so great.

46:41.016 --> 46:42.116
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be awesome.

46:42.176 --> 46:44.097
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to show all my friend.

46:44.857 --> 46:48.758
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just stupid, though.

46:49.358 --> 46:50.238
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't get it.

46:50.398 --> 46:58.281
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not because people are not buying a PlayStation 3 or going on their network service because there's no achievements or me's.

46:58.541 --> 47:03.082
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because of $600, not because there's no me's.

47:03.780 --> 47:07.966
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't go, oh wow, you know, there's me's on here now.

47:08.206 --> 47:10.169
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll spend $600 on a PlayStation 3.

47:10.950 --> 47:14.114
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not the reason why people aren't buying your platform.

47:15.196 --> 47:16.598
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, you want to chime in?

47:17.679 --> 47:18.921
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

47:20.620 --> 47:24.283
[SPEAKER_03]: What if, let's say, PlayStation puts out a patch.

47:24.403 --> 47:26.345
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually do have an online version on that, by the way.

47:26.685 --> 47:30.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say PlayStation comes out with a patch and all the old games get this too.

47:30.408 --> 47:34.911
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's relatively enough games out there where they could go back to all the old games and patch them.

47:35.371 --> 47:38.814
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's say you could get a Captain America shield in your house from playing.

47:39.074 --> 47:40.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be cool?

47:40.785 --> 47:41.405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it would.

47:42.485 --> 47:47.307
[SPEAKER_03]: But is that enough to be like a real robust feature that could sell the PlayStation 3?

47:47.407 --> 47:49.187
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, hey, come over to my house.

47:49.407 --> 47:51.348
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a Captain America shield.

47:51.408 --> 47:53.908
[SPEAKER_08]: My answer time.

47:53.988 --> 47:55.849
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a, hey, come over to my house.

47:55.909 --> 47:57.169
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a Captain America shield in it.

47:57.829 --> 48:08.552
[SPEAKER_02]: If it were like something where the whole environment was very like Animal Crossing where you can walk around and talk to people like this big online chat room almost with avatars.

48:09.073 --> 48:09.993
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of cool.

48:10.013 --> 48:10.374
[SPEAKER_02]: Which it could be.

48:10.514 --> 48:13.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, it hasn't been officially announced yet.

48:13.235 --> 48:16.636
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was Browser the MMO or something, then that would be one.

48:16.976 --> 48:18.337
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's enough to sell the system.

48:18.577 --> 48:30.182
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I think, is that I don't think it's $600 cool, but Sony badly needs something cute like this to kind of help their image, if that makes any sense.

48:30.563 --> 48:32.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, they really need something like this.

48:32.965 --> 48:34.425
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it boils down to the games.

48:34.586 --> 48:41.810
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they need something also to flesh out their network because right now their network's just kind of a clusterfuck of I don't know what's going on, you know?

48:41.970 --> 48:45.833
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no downloadable content for the games.

48:46.093 --> 48:48.454
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hardly any demos online.

48:48.534 --> 48:51.416
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hardly any download content other than PlayStation 1 games.

48:51.896 --> 48:52.417
[SPEAKER_02]: Great!

48:52.477 --> 48:53.357
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 1 games.

48:53.477 --> 48:55.859
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a PS3 to download games to my PSP.

48:56.179 --> 48:59.141
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, people have broke already so you can, you know...

49:00.171 --> 49:03.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Copy them and completely pirate the shit.

49:03.913 --> 49:08.917
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like there's no motivation for me to go online with this thing.

49:10.298 --> 49:10.598
[SPEAKER_02]: At all.

49:10.918 --> 49:12.999
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sorry.

49:13.039 --> 49:15.341
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just... Motorstorm's going to be a great game.

49:15.561 --> 49:15.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

49:15.981 --> 49:21.184
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I should buy a PlayStation 3 just to be your friend and take pity on you.

49:21.565 --> 49:21.865
[SPEAKER_03]: I just...

49:22.273 --> 49:23.993
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel so bad for you and you're my friend.

49:24.013 --> 49:24.073
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

49:24.314 --> 49:25.474
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play my PlayStation 3.

49:25.794 --> 49:29.535
[SPEAKER_02]: I play my 360 and I've been playing the Wii a little bit, but mainly my 360.

49:30.095 --> 49:34.916
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a time when I was playing Resistance, I'm like, well, I don't know when am I going to go back and play my 360.

49:34.956 --> 49:39.197
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it didn't take long, finished Resistance, and then there's no reason to play it anymore.

49:39.297 --> 49:45.679
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm back to playing my 360 where there's a bunch of new shit coming out, which is great, you know, but...

49:46.328 --> 49:49.171
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 doesn't have anything really unique to it.

49:49.471 --> 49:50.192
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything.

49:50.452 --> 49:54.036
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm going to get a game, I'm going to get it on the 360 because it has achievements.

49:55.057 --> 49:56.659
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Wolf's getting a little territorial.

49:56.699 --> 49:59.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Wolf says, no, Sky, he's my friend.

49:59.302 --> 50:00.423
[SPEAKER_03]: You stay back, bitch.

50:02.785 --> 50:03.866
[SPEAKER_09]: You can add me and Dan.

50:03.886 --> 50:05.188
[SPEAKER_09]: We're on there as Gunstar Hero.

50:05.208 --> 50:09.092
[SPEAKER_03]: Cue the scary music theme, single white female, whatever.

50:09.642 --> 50:15.105
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so definitely something that will continue to develop next week at Game Developers Conference when they actually announce it.

50:15.185 --> 50:17.446
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, sorry, it's supposed to be a rumor, but come on.

50:17.886 --> 50:19.107
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know it's probably true.

50:19.307 --> 50:19.927
[SPEAKER_02]: It is true.

50:19.987 --> 50:22.369
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already registered the fucking trademarks for it.

50:22.389 --> 50:23.509
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a logo for it.

50:24.089 --> 50:25.130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out.

50:25.570 --> 50:32.994
[SPEAKER_02]: They just didn't want it to look like that this was something that they thought up real quick or anything like, I don't know, the six-axis controller.

50:34.123 --> 51:01.618
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to know We always meant for that to have tilt control It wasn't like after we saw the Wii or anything that we decided to put this in here Could someone going to Game Developers Conference randomly shout out I love you Kotaku during the Sony press conference like after or before when everybody's coming in I would do it myself but I'm afraid of getting kicked out So I need someone with bigger balls I can't even go so I didn't get invited You can just go Is it free?

51:02.158 --> 51:03.119
[SPEAKER_03]: Well if you're a press, yes

51:04.408 --> 51:05.589
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you'd have to register, though.

51:05.949 --> 51:06.809
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it at the thing.

51:07.930 --> 51:09.731
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do that.

51:09.891 --> 51:10.911
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'll talk to you offline.

51:11.231 --> 51:14.953
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

51:15.493 --> 51:18.634
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is a little bit more from Sony.

51:18.835 --> 51:24.097
[SPEAKER_08]: They have their launch lineup for the European PlayStation Network.

51:25.635 --> 51:54.362
[SPEAKER_08]: there will be a few downloads available on March 23rd Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection for £6.99 Blast Factor for £3.49 and Gran Turismo HD Trial for free other games that are set to come out is on the 30th Super Rub-a-Dub which is a duck 6th April Flow, 13th April Go Sudoku and 20th April Go Puzzle so there's just a few things

51:55.537 --> 52:08.967
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you noticed that a lot of their games that they make for the online network that use 6-axis tilt controls are just games where it's involving you shooting something or something in water that you tilt the thing around.

52:08.987 --> 52:13.570
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that the 6-axis is good for is fucking Etch-a-Sketch shit.

52:14.590 --> 52:15.871
[SPEAKER_08]: For the record, I hate the 6-axis.

52:16.532 --> 52:17.913
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually... I hate it.

52:18.313 --> 52:18.613
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

52:19.774 --> 52:24.157
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you had to do shit with it on Marvel Ultimate Alliance and it's so fucking unwieldy.

52:24.938 --> 52:25.919
[SPEAKER_08]: It just isn't annoyance.

52:26.359 --> 52:32.243
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that would be kind of funny as an extra sketch because you could use the analog sticks and the dials and then you could shake the controller to clear it.

52:33.024 --> 52:33.324
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

52:33.524 --> 52:37.107
[SPEAKER_03]: They should make downloadable... But what if I had Parkinson's and I'd never be able to draw anything?

52:37.447 --> 52:39.408
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

52:40.029 --> 52:40.869
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy that then.

52:41.710 --> 52:42.270
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy a Wii.

52:42.310 --> 52:43.271
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy a 360 then.

52:43.431 --> 52:44.232
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I will.

52:44.352 --> 52:45.973
[SPEAKER_02]: And where the 360 will rumble for you.

52:47.534 --> 52:48.735
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so...

52:50.558 --> 52:50.938
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

53:15.305 --> 53:15.805
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

53:44.764 --> 53:53.689
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, you know, maybe they may announce something at Game Developers Conference, you know, that they're redesigning the PS3 or something like that, so.

53:54.049 --> 53:55.089
[SPEAKER_03]: Now in pretty colors.

53:55.930 --> 53:56.430
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

53:57.191 --> 53:57.671
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

53:57.751 --> 54:01.293
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be pretty smart to beat Nintendo to the market with that kind of crap.

54:01.493 --> 54:02.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Beat them at their own game?

54:02.693 --> 54:03.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

54:04.594 --> 54:08.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, unless they come out and say, now in pretty colors and $200 cheaper.

54:10.157 --> 54:11.138
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'm sold yet.

54:13.059 --> 54:13.319
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

54:14.137 --> 54:18.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that might bring some people back to the PlayStation 3, including Hideo Kojima.

54:19.279 --> 54:22.820
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can think back to an old story, I mean, yes, we all know Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming out on 360.

54:23.180 --> 54:27.422
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get Microsoft out of my mind tonight.

54:27.442 --> 54:27.922
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?

54:28.282 --> 54:31.524
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming out on PlayStation 3.

54:32.784 --> 54:34.265
[SPEAKER_03]: But what did Kojima say he missed?

54:34.605 --> 54:35.365
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble, right?

54:35.745 --> 54:37.486
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was an essential part of Metal Gear Solid.

54:37.546 --> 54:39.827
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, Rumble is not on the PlayStation 3.

54:39.867 --> 54:39.967
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

54:41.570 --> 54:44.292
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Rumble could be coming back.

54:45.013 --> 54:50.578
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why we say could be is because Sony and Immersion have settled their patent litigation.

54:50.938 --> 54:52.219
[SPEAKER_03]: Think back in the past.

54:52.559 --> 54:54.581
[SPEAKER_03]: Immersion sued Sony over the Rumble thing.

54:54.601 --> 54:56.262
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually settled with Microsoft.

54:56.282 --> 55:03.068
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe Nintendo, they either settled or Nintendo had already worked it out with Immersion before they ever put it in there.

55:03.248 --> 55:04.549
[SPEAKER_03]: They worked it out with the other two companies.

55:04.569 --> 55:05.770
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you have Rumble and the 360 and the Wii.

55:06.601 --> 55:07.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble is so last gen

55:25.445 --> 55:31.067
[SPEAKER_02]: The Edge on the competition, but really, they're just kind of trailing behind in ideas and innovation.

55:31.508 --> 55:31.988
[SPEAKER_02]: This time.

55:32.448 --> 55:34.989
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this time, I mean, well, all the time.

55:35.049 --> 55:35.909
[SPEAKER_02]: When have they been ahead?

55:35.949 --> 55:38.691
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, okay, granted, they had a DVD drive and a PlayStation 2.

55:39.431 --> 55:41.052
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good for them.

55:41.212 --> 55:42.032
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's good.

55:42.092 --> 55:45.173
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of stuff on PlayStation 1 and 2 were a little bit ahead of time.

55:45.193 --> 55:48.055
[SPEAKER_02]: They were behind on the fucking, you know, rumble technology.

55:48.075 --> 55:51.396
[SPEAKER_02]: They're behind on analog sticks on there, but...

55:52.842 --> 55:56.363
[SPEAKER_02]: and even the controller designs fucking copying off of the Super Nintendo.

55:56.423 --> 55:58.323
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

55:58.403 --> 55:59.984
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just playing the copycat game.

56:00.384 --> 56:02.024
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they did it pretty well the last two gens.

56:02.484 --> 56:04.005
[SPEAKER_03]: Well... Alright, well anyway.

56:04.945 --> 56:08.406
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes this whole thing very interesting is what Kaz Hirai had to say after this whole thing.

56:08.466 --> 56:15.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, We look forward to exploring with immersion exciting new ways to bring the largest and best range of gameplay experiences to our customers.

56:16.008 --> 56:22.089
[SPEAKER_03]: We are very excited about our new partnership with immersion and the potential for new and innovative products incorporating their technologies.

56:22.580 --> 56:25.161
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, I gotta buy new controllers now, thank you very much.

56:26.942 --> 56:28.003
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I can trade them in.

56:30.484 --> 56:32.065
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, I guess is all I can say.

56:32.105 --> 56:45.551
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not even like three days ago, someone over at Sony, I don't remember who said it, but somebody at Sony said, it was probably that crazy guy from Sony Europe, Phil Harrison, I think he was the one that said, Rumble is so last gen.

56:50.740 --> 57:16.683
[SPEAKER_08]: and now things seem to change on a dime yet again well we do though anything in this industry though does change pretty crazy including release dates however I have a fairly decent list for our UK listeners so starting with the releases on the 5th which would be tomorrow for us actually it's the 5th there already

57:17.205 --> 57:19.447
[SPEAKER_08]: is a Wario Master of Disguise in the DS.

57:19.927 --> 57:42.304
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming up on the 9th is Bullet Witch, Castlevania Portrait of Ruin, Garfield's Nightmare, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, Luminous Plus, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2, March of the Minis, Rogue Galaxy, Runaway 2, The Dream of the Turtle, Silverfall, The Household Detroit Streets, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, and Trackmania United on PC.

57:43.645 --> 57:43.805
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

57:45.088 --> 58:12.994
[SPEAKER_02]: we actually have a pretty good week as far as release dates in the United States definitely some good stuff especially one of my favorites coming to the Playstation 2 Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories for the whopping cheap price of $19.99 so you should definitely check it out of course I don't think there's going to be multiplayer in there so that kind of sucks Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 for the 360 and the PC Def Jam Icon for Playstation 3 and the 360 that should be pretty cool

58:13.815 --> 58:25.064
[SPEAKER_02]: Titan Quest Immortal Throne Motor Storm Wario Master of Disguise Rayman's Raving Rabbids Shrek's Smashing Crash Racing Burnout Dominator PlayStation 2 and the PSP Tortuga Two Treasures

58:44.141 --> 58:44.541
[SPEAKER_02]: VIRTUA TENNIS

59:13.479 --> 59:15.320
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's coming out on March the 8th.

59:16.041 --> 59:22.166
[SPEAKER_03]: On some other systems, over on the Nintendo Wii, Bomberman Land Wii is coming out on March 8th.

59:22.226 --> 59:23.587
[SPEAKER_03]: See, this is why I like doing this segment.

59:23.647 --> 59:26.729
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know they were making a freaking Bomberman game for the Wii, so there you have it.

59:27.030 --> 59:29.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully much better than Bomberman Act Zero.

59:30.292 --> 59:32.554
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully they don't take Bomberman into the future.

59:33.054 --> 59:33.815
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.

59:34.535 --> 59:40.760
[SPEAKER_03]: A game called iShield 21 from Nintendo is actually coming out over in Japan this week as well.

59:40.780 --> 59:41.281
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like...

59:42.295 --> 59:44.716
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it could be a fighting game or something.

59:44.736 --> 59:45.856
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure exactly what this is.

59:47.236 --> 59:49.757
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually more of an action game, it looks like.

59:50.377 --> 59:52.277
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to see what some of the screenshots look like.

59:52.297 --> 59:54.838
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it has a bunch of different modes in it there.

59:54.858 --> 59:57.338
[SPEAKER_03]: You kick a ball in one mode as a football player.

59:58.158 --> 01:00:00.359
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like another one you throw a football.

01:00:00.719 --> 01:00:05.980
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might be an amateur Olympics type of game.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.300
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.481
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe someone in chat will pipe up who knows more about that game.

01:00:10.721 --> 01:00:11.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?

01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:14.039
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's called Eyeshield 21.

01:00:15.119 --> 01:00:18.141
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an anime-based football game, I think.

01:00:18.962 --> 01:00:19.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

01:00:19.302 --> 01:00:20.082
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember correctly.

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:24.725
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, I guess, Imagine Madden, but with fictional football characters.

01:00:24.745 --> 01:00:25.245
[SPEAKER_02]: They're anime.

01:00:26.266 --> 01:00:26.546
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:00:27.407 --> 01:00:35.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out on the PlayStation 2, you have Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania Masterpiece Gold coming out over in Japan.

01:00:36.072 --> 01:00:37.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Used to import all those Guitar Freaks games.

01:00:37.773 --> 01:00:38.774
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, are you going to get this one?

01:00:39.114 --> 01:00:39.274
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:00:39.294 --> 01:00:39.334
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

01:00:39.935 --> 01:00:41.036
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:02.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Kenka Banshu 2 Full Throttle Doraemon

01:01:29.125 --> 01:01:35.669
[SPEAKER_03]: Doraemon Nobita no Shin Maki Daibouken Dragon Sakura DS EQ Trainer DS Puzzle Series

01:01:51.716 --> 01:01:55.921
[SPEAKER_03]: Second Detsetsu Heroes of Mana coming out from Square Enix.

01:01:56.402 --> 01:01:59.365
[SPEAKER_03]: And I imagine that would be the next Mana game that we're going to get over here.

01:02:00.146 --> 01:02:01.568
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting Dawn of Mana next.

01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:03.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's probably the same thing, just a different name.

01:02:04.251 --> 01:02:09.738
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, of course, speculation from someone who has not done their research on what exactly that game is.

01:02:11.155 --> 01:02:11.836
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:02:26.384 --> 01:02:32.986
[SPEAKER_02]: and that game Spelling Spree which was being released by Ubisoft is now known as Wordplay.

01:02:33.546 --> 01:02:36.927
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess they thought Spelling Spree was retarded as a name.

01:02:37.267 --> 01:02:41.288
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to thank everyone in chatroom who was yelling at me over what Eyeshield 21 is.

01:02:41.689 --> 01:02:44.849
[SPEAKER_03]: You all watch far more Japanese import animation than I do.

01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:45.490
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:47.830
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking football, dumbass!

01:02:49.311 --> 01:02:49.851
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

01:02:52.185 --> 01:02:53.466
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Rob, you should know better.

01:02:53.907 --> 01:02:55.088
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, did you know what it was?

01:02:55.268 --> 01:02:56.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say anything to try to correct me?

01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:59.632
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I like seeing you flounder.

01:02:59.812 --> 01:03:00.272
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a bitch.

01:03:01.013 --> 01:03:02.014
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, so.

01:03:02.794 --> 01:03:16.326
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, speaking of bitchy things, you know, at least things that are going to have other companies bitching, it has been speculated that the Wii is going to outsell the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 through 2008.

01:03:19.747 --> 01:03:31.076
[SPEAKER_08]: The market research firm IDC has basically stated that they believe the hardware shipments of the Wii will capture more than a third of the worldwide market by 2008.

01:03:31.477 --> 01:03:35.680
[SPEAKER_08]: And it will rise above the PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:03:36.881 --> 01:03:39.903
[SPEAKER_03]: In related news, I still don't give a shit what an analyst has to say.

01:03:41.365 --> 01:03:43.326
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's already proving, though, to be that way.

01:03:43.366 --> 01:03:45.268
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, look at how it's performing.

01:03:45.668 --> 01:03:47.870
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you that, but I get so sick of these

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Analyst says this.

01:03:50.101 --> 01:03:51.341
[SPEAKER_03]: Stories making it to blogs.

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:54.522
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm not talking about any stories with analysts.

01:03:54.562 --> 01:03:56.343
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's catching a lot of news and what have you.

01:03:56.463 --> 01:03:57.363
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

01:03:57.383 --> 01:04:00.324
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole reason I thought that it was relevant is because it is happening.

01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:01.984
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that we actually see happening.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:02.564
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you that.

01:04:02.584 --> 01:04:05.485
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like we had this week as well.

01:04:05.665 --> 01:04:08.286
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another analyst that said that the PlayStation 3 is going to take over by 2010.

01:04:08.346 --> 01:04:11.207
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there was another analyst that says the Wii is going to take over.

01:04:11.227 --> 01:04:13.668
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there was another analyst that says the 360 is going to take over.

01:04:14.147 --> 01:04:15.769
[SPEAKER_02]: We need someone to analyze the analysts.

01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:16.570
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what that means?

01:04:17.251 --> 01:04:18.472
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crap information.

01:04:19.013 --> 01:04:21.055
[SPEAKER_02]: Your guess is as good as their guess.

01:04:21.576 --> 01:04:22.838
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about this guess?

01:04:22.878 --> 01:04:25.261
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually kind of agree with it.

01:04:25.321 --> 01:04:33.651
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that we will continue to outpace 360 and PlayStation 3 just based on the reactions of people I see who aren't gamers.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:44.410
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, keep in mind, Cars was one of the top-selling games last year, not thanks to any hardcore gamer who reads the blogs and thinks that that's the whole gaming world right there in that bubble.

01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:48.672
[SPEAKER_03]: The casual gamer is what's going to push the Wii, I believe, ahead of those other two systems.

01:04:49.693 --> 01:04:50.753
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

01:04:50.913 --> 01:04:55.116
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the 360, there's going to be some great games coming out.

01:04:55.216 --> 01:04:56.877
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit slow in the beginning of the year.

01:04:57.377 --> 01:04:59.718
[SPEAKER_02]: January, there's Lost Planet coming out, Bell.

01:04:59.919 --> 01:05:00.359
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

01:05:00.439 --> 01:05:02.240
[SPEAKER_02]: January, there's two games for the...

01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:07.640
[SPEAKER_02]: 3.60, most people were still picking up the Wii's because they couldn't get a hold of them at, you know, launch.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:15.363
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just, you know, right now, I think, I think by the end of this year, I still think the 360's going to be beating the crap out of the Wii.

01:05:15.523 --> 01:05:18.264
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't really hear people talking about Lost Planet anymore.

01:05:18.284 --> 01:05:18.624
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

01:05:18.644 --> 01:05:20.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet I still hear people talking about Wii Sports.

01:05:21.885 --> 01:05:25.266
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's because people are simpletons and they like Wii Sports.

01:05:25.967 --> 01:05:26.967
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, big deal.

01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:32.209
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people are picking up Wii Play not because of Wii Play, but because it came with another controller.

01:05:33.169 --> 01:05:35.630
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's just not putting out enough product.

01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:42.793
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I had a story here real quick that Nintendo is slow to resupply retailers with brand new Wii's.

01:05:43.353 --> 01:05:44.614
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can attest to that.

01:05:44.714 --> 01:05:50.796
[SPEAKER_02]: Distribution for the month of March is being cut out of their replenishment cycles.

01:05:50.856 --> 01:05:53.117
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, Nintendo has said, guess what?

01:05:53.738 --> 01:05:57.019
[SPEAKER_02]: Distributors out there, you're not getting any new Wii's for the month of March.

01:05:57.159 --> 01:06:00.521
[SPEAKER_02]: We're giving them all to retailers because we can't make enough.

01:06:01.001 --> 01:06:01.341
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:06:02.305 --> 01:06:14.661
[SPEAKER_02]: They right now are having a problem with production, and I think they just need to pump out as many systems, but eventually it's going to plateau once all those people that were waiting to get one finally get one.

01:06:14.761 --> 01:06:15.802
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now there's...

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:26.505
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I mean, Super Paper Mario coming out in April, but there's not any real big games announced that have definite dates yet, other than, you know, the fall.

01:06:26.545 --> 01:06:28.006
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's going to just plateau.

01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:32.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the DS drought all over again, despite what Mr. Fils-Aimé said previously.

01:06:32.569 --> 01:06:33.129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seriously.

01:06:33.209 --> 01:06:37.411
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Party's been delayed to whenever, at least summer.

01:06:37.811 --> 01:06:40.973
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, there's really a lot of crappy games coming out.

01:06:40.993 --> 01:06:43.334
[SPEAKER_02]: But Zelda Ocarina of Time on Virtual Console.

01:06:43.555 --> 01:06:44.115
[SPEAKER_02]: Fap, fap, fap.

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:46.171
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody, great.

01:06:46.751 --> 01:06:47.371
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

01:06:48.192 --> 01:06:51.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Virtual console, totally the reason why you should buy a Wii.

01:06:52.154 --> 01:06:57.857
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of, you have to admit, for some, again, casual gamers, that kind of appeals to them.

01:06:58.397 --> 01:07:00.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, great, but I don't think it's going to sell systems, though.

01:07:01.079 --> 01:07:09.203
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, really, right now, people saw, like, WarioWare, and it was a lot of fun, and they're seeing some of the games coming out probably in March, but...

01:07:10.366 --> 01:07:13.528
[SPEAKER_02]: There is going to be a drought, and I think that's going to plateau off.

01:07:13.689 --> 01:07:20.975
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the 360, if they have as big of a month as they're planning to in May, it's going to keep going.

01:07:21.055 --> 01:07:24.798
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think with Game Developer Conference, there's going to be some major announcements.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:31.364
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually, especially with November, we're just going to see it take off again, with Halo 3 especially.

01:07:32.125 --> 01:07:33.666
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

01:07:35.291 --> 01:07:46.581
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to both these topics here, Gaming Nerd in chat says, By 2010, none of these consoles are going to be good since the next gen will be here and some console will get released a year before the rest.

01:07:47.661 --> 01:07:48.142
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

01:07:49.003 --> 01:07:53.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, also talking about JV Mon says, Who the fuck cares about Ocarina?

01:07:54.167 --> 01:07:58.231
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much because I think Ocarina is one of the most overhyped games ever.

01:07:58.451 --> 01:07:59.652
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Ocarina of Time.

01:07:59.872 --> 01:08:00.813
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of my favorite games.

01:08:00.953 --> 01:08:01.734
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

01:08:02.392 --> 01:08:03.012
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it!

01:08:03.253 --> 01:08:04.233
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of my favorite games.

01:08:04.513 --> 01:08:11.058
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's certain websites out there that review some of these Zelda games, and because it's Zelda, they give it a 10 out of 10.

01:08:12.639 --> 01:08:27.068
[SPEAKER_02]: Not saying which websites, but I saw that and rolled my eyes and go, well, I kind of figured you'd do this, seeing as you've got a big hard-on over fucking Twilight Princess, which, I might add, it's a great game, but it's not perfect.

01:08:27.188 --> 01:08:29.470
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have a hard-on over Twilight Princess, actually.

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.990
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't...

01:08:30.797 --> 01:08:33.840
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't fucking, you know, the greatest thing on Earth.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:38.604
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen way better, and... But, actually, it was pretty good.

01:08:40.345 --> 01:08:45.069
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, no, I don't think... For me, Ocarina was no Link to the Past.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:46.090
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my problem.

01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:49.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Call me a 2D gamer, whatever, but that was my problem, was Ocarina was no Link to the Past.

01:08:50.294 --> 01:08:52.095
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, so, whatever.

01:08:52.756 --> 01:08:54.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Controversial viewpoint, sorry, what can I say?

01:08:55.218 --> 01:08:58.421
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we love to have here on this show, are controversial viewpoints.

01:08:59.349 --> 01:09:04.190
[SPEAKER_03]: What we also love on this show are other little bits of retro goodness, and this always makes me squee.

01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:09.491
[SPEAKER_03]: And I notice Rice Princess is here joining us now, so say hello to the fanboys and girls.

01:09:09.551 --> 01:09:10.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess?

01:09:10.872 --> 01:09:11.312
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

01:09:11.932 --> 01:09:12.592
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing this week?

01:09:13.312 --> 01:09:13.993
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of tired.

01:09:14.673 --> 01:09:15.133
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear that.

01:09:15.153 --> 01:09:16.993
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to nap on the ground there while we do the show?

01:09:17.593 --> 01:09:18.234
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's filthy.

01:09:19.134 --> 01:09:19.394
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:09:20.706 --> 01:09:33.053
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you remember this game, Rice Princess, but coming to the Wii from System 3, we've talked about this previously on the show, but we have some box art now for Impossible Mission coming out to the Wii.

01:09:33.473 --> 01:09:35.114
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you freaking joking?

01:09:35.134 --> 01:09:35.915
[SPEAKER_07]: This is awesome.

01:09:36.415 --> 01:09:37.015
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not.

01:09:37.095 --> 01:09:43.299
[SPEAKER_03]: This is news that just makes you want to shout, ah.

01:09:43.559 --> 01:09:45.140
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more like, another visitor.

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay a while.

01:09:46.621 --> 01:09:47.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay forever.

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:48.802
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's going to get that.

01:09:49.505 --> 01:09:52.628
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Impossible Mission, if you can believe it, came out 25 years ago.

01:09:52.648 --> 01:09:59.355
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the first games to use real synthesized speech, such as the type that Rice Princess and I just performed for you guys.

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:01.997
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, this is not Mission Impossible.

01:10:02.097 --> 01:10:03.979
[SPEAKER_03]: This was, I guess you could call it a spoof game.

01:10:04.259 --> 01:10:05.801
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some cool little screenshots there.

01:10:05.841 --> 01:10:07.502
[SPEAKER_03]: These are from the DS version of the game.

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:08.483
[SPEAKER_03]: But look at that.

01:10:09.364 --> 01:10:13.008
[SPEAKER_03]: What they did right with this is the same damn game, just with really pretty graphics.

01:10:13.528 --> 01:10:14.209
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:40.902
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's also coming out on the PSP you can see PSP, DS and Wii so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen there also what's new to this game there is a new tutorial mode there's also three game modes and three characters to choose from the characters look to be the dude that was in the original game a chick now is that a chick or a guy with long hair actually I can't tell oh no it's a chick and a robot named Gamma what?

01:10:42.163 --> 01:10:42.904
[SPEAKER_06]: a robot?

01:10:43.284 --> 01:10:44.505
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what it is a robot

01:10:45.527 --> 01:10:47.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the three game modes you can play.

01:10:47.548 --> 01:10:50.851
[SPEAKER_03]: New, original, and of course, the hybrid mode.

01:10:51.072 --> 01:10:52.693
[SPEAKER_03]: The original game with the updated graphics.

01:10:53.074 --> 01:10:53.474
[SPEAKER_03]: Swoon.

01:10:53.774 --> 01:10:57.738
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so when you play the robot, does he say, get him, my humans?

01:10:57.858 --> 01:10:58.959
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, that doesn't make sense.

01:10:58.999 --> 01:10:59.720
[SPEAKER_07]: Why a robot?

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:00.260
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?

01:11:01.021 --> 01:11:03.483
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's like an android or something.

01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:03.924
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:11:04.304 --> 01:11:06.086
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't you still say, get him, my robots?

01:11:06.926 --> 01:11:10.870
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what they do, they shot out little electricity beams, and if you're made of metal, that's probably going to hurt.

01:11:11.969 --> 01:11:14.390
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, that just seems a little bit shady to me.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:16.391
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I want this game anymore.

01:11:17.112 --> 01:11:21.074
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna not buy this game based off the fact you could play as a robot.

01:11:22.054 --> 01:11:27.177
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I could also just play it, like, on the Commodore 64, like it originally was.

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:28.778
[SPEAKER_03]: But new game modes!

01:11:29.538 --> 01:11:29.878
[SPEAKER_07]: So?

01:11:29.898 --> 01:11:31.119
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.260
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally buying it for the Wii.

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.941
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to this game so much.

01:11:35.441 --> 01:11:37.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they ever say if this was coming to the US for sure?

01:11:38.523 --> 01:11:40.224
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know this is coming to, um...

01:11:40.931 --> 01:11:45.695
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe, and I can see the box art has the Europe ratings on it, but did they ever say they'd confirm this for the U.S.?

01:11:46.556 --> 01:11:51.060
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know the same company's putting out Elevator Action, and that's coming to the U.S., so it is probably.

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:51.581
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:52.541
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

01:11:52.622 --> 01:11:55.284
[SPEAKER_03]: System 8 or whatever, we should call them and get an interview.

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:56.465
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do that.

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:57.085
[SPEAKER_03]: System 3?

01:11:57.466 --> 01:11:57.966
[SPEAKER_03]: System 3, sorry.

01:11:57.986 --> 01:11:59.848
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I thought System 8.

01:12:00.088 --> 01:12:05.032
[SPEAKER_03]: System 3, I'm going to call them and try to get an interview, and beg and plead for impossible admission like a sad little fanboy.

01:12:07.054 --> 01:12:07.294
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:17.065
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of sad little fanboys, but nothing actually having to do with sad little fanboys, guess what is coming out to the Wii, thanks to Vivendi?

01:12:18.025 --> 01:12:19.106
[SPEAKER_08]: We are getting Scarface.

01:12:20.767 --> 01:12:33.154
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is kind of funny, because with the game that it being, you're actually going to be using the nunchuck to walk, to drive, to walk around, to pilot boats, and you shoot using the Wiimote.

01:12:34.082 --> 01:12:38.826
[SPEAKER_08]: and you even have a chainsaw for hand-to-hand combat so you have to wiggle around and all that.

01:12:39.846 --> 01:12:48.253
[SPEAKER_08]: But where on the PS2 and Xbox Ones you had to swear to increase your kill factor, you do it by making dirty gestures with your Wiimote.

01:12:49.474 --> 01:12:52.336
[SPEAKER_08]: The more you gesture, the more your kill factor goes up.

01:12:52.516 --> 01:12:53.617
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot sluts, yes or no?

01:12:54.497 --> 01:12:55.958
[SPEAKER_08]: I see nothing regarding hot sluts.

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:57.520
[SPEAKER_03]: There are hot sluts in the game.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:02.023
[SPEAKER_08]: The game will take place after the final mansion shootout.

01:13:05.019 --> 01:13:18.365
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG spoilers oh come on the movie's from 1983 Rob it's basically he doesn't die and he has to instead he has to reclaim his fortune wait he dies at the end?

01:13:19.085 --> 01:13:33.632
[SPEAKER_03]: yes he dies at the end of the movie oh great next thing I know you're going to tell me that like freaking Darth Vader is Luke's father or something you're going to tell me like freaking you know the Titanic sinks in that movie I mean what else do you want to ruin for me while you're here

01:13:36.035 --> 01:13:37.356
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I have to kick somebody out of the chatroom.

01:13:39.636 --> 01:13:40.557
[SPEAKER_03]: Is somebody being bad?

01:13:41.457 --> 01:13:42.678
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, somebody's being punished.

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:51.021
[SPEAKER_08]: I told Nintendo Maniac 64 not to use the, uh, um, the, what you're listening to shit in the chatroom.

01:13:51.041 --> 01:13:51.841
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that stuff annoys.

01:13:52.201 --> 01:13:54.942
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so, uh, next, uh, next time's gonna be a ban, so.

01:13:55.002 --> 01:13:55.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, regulate.

01:13:55.903 --> 01:13:56.063
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

01:13:56.483 --> 01:13:57.083
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care who it is.

01:13:57.663 --> 01:13:58.324
[SPEAKER_08]: We have rules for reasons.

01:13:58.344 --> 01:13:59.844
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I'm listening to hot sluts porn?

01:14:01.425 --> 01:14:01.865
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

01:14:02.811 --> 01:14:04.811
[SPEAKER_08]: No one gives a shit about what anybody else is listening to.

01:14:04.831 --> 01:14:06.152
[SPEAKER_08]: You're supposed to be listening to the show.

01:14:08.072 --> 01:14:08.672
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

01:14:08.892 --> 01:14:10.192
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else on Scarface you want to add?

01:14:12.373 --> 01:14:12.533
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:14:12.833 --> 01:14:13.093
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:14:13.573 --> 01:14:16.573
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, speaking of games... Snape kills Tony!

01:14:17.914 --> 01:14:27.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of games on the Wii, there is a trend that we're going to start seeing, much like we did with DS, where companies go, hey, we're making games for the Wii, too.

01:14:27.695 --> 01:14:29.496
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, well, what games do you have?

01:14:29.596 --> 01:14:31.916
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, well, um...

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:34.037
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninja Bread Man

01:15:01.767 --> 01:15:04.389
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Ninja Bread Man sounds awesome.

01:15:05.469 --> 01:15:06.790
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about, crap games?

01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:07.470
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds great.

01:15:07.651 --> 01:15:09.532
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster Trucks Extreme.

01:15:09.592 --> 01:15:11.833
[SPEAKER_02]: Trucks spelled T-R-U-X, of course.

01:15:14.214 --> 01:15:16.275
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, isn't that one of your favorite things ever?

01:15:16.395 --> 01:15:19.317
[SPEAKER_03]: When they purposefully missed Bratz, B-R-A-T-Z?

01:15:19.597 --> 01:15:20.317
[SPEAKER_08]: That's retarded.

01:15:20.718 --> 01:15:24.520
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's Monster Trucks Extreme Off-Road Edition.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.021
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I guess the last game was on-road.

01:15:28.822 --> 01:15:30.343
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that related to Big Mother Truckers?

01:15:30.848 --> 01:15:32.129
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's probably just a crappy game.

01:15:33.249 --> 01:15:37.952
[SPEAKER_02]: Anubis 2, Rock and Roll Adventures.

01:15:37.972 --> 01:15:41.053
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Rock and Roll High School.

01:15:41.133 --> 01:15:41.773
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so there.

01:15:41.953 --> 01:15:42.434
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

01:15:43.174 --> 01:15:44.335
[SPEAKER_02]: Hamster Heroes.

01:15:45.495 --> 01:15:46.996
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you call these bad games?

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:48.116
[SPEAKER_04]: Hamster Heroes?

01:15:48.417 --> 01:15:49.437
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds amazing.

01:15:50.898 --> 01:15:52.058
[SPEAKER_02]: Mini Desktop Racing.

01:15:53.439 --> 01:15:55.320
[SPEAKER_02]: These will be the people that put out Laser Cats.

01:15:55.919 --> 01:16:01.043
[SPEAKER_02]: Trixie in Toyland, London Taxi Rush Hour, and let's see what else we had here.

01:16:01.403 --> 01:16:05.587
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy the Wizard, uh, I can't even read what that said.

01:16:05.687 --> 01:16:11.271
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like fucking, oh, Rocket Broomstick Racing, and, um,

01:16:12.247 --> 01:16:13.808
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna play Hamster Heroes!

01:16:26.448 --> 01:16:27.709
[SPEAKER_02]: Data Design Interactive.

01:16:27.729 --> 01:16:28.810
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we could check out their website.

01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:29.671
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you send them an email, Loki?

01:16:29.991 --> 01:16:30.652
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in touch with them.

01:16:30.672 --> 01:16:31.052
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send them.

01:16:31.072 --> 01:16:34.935
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them we will promote Hamster Heroes here on the program and Ninja Bread Man.

01:16:35.156 --> 01:16:39.559
[SPEAKER_02]: I like hamsters, but, you know, I don't know if that game's going to be any good.

01:16:39.579 --> 01:16:40.961
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, who gives a shit?

01:16:40.981 --> 01:16:44.724
[SPEAKER_02]: They're putting out Chicken Shoot on fucking, you know, the Wii.

01:16:45.084 --> 01:16:46.045
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know what?

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:49.308
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's only fair that they're allowed to put these games out.

01:16:49.768 --> 01:16:51.330
[SPEAKER_02]: Just all you have to do...

01:16:52.418 --> 01:16:58.639
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster Trucks Extreme, at least better than Monster 4x4 World Circuit, because that game was atrocious.

01:16:59.099 --> 01:17:02.580
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireboma says, Rocket Broomstick Racing sounds like Quidditch, but worse.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.501
[SPEAKER_03]: To which somebody else had a follow-up.

01:17:05.541 --> 01:17:10.722
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of spoilers, because we were talking about spoilers in the last one, GS68 had a comment for DarkSakura.

01:17:11.002 --> 01:17:13.563
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 has figured out who will die in Book 7.

01:17:14.683 --> 01:17:16.463
[SPEAKER_03]: Harry and Nintendo Maniac 64.

01:17:17.283 --> 01:17:18.924
[SPEAKER_03]: So he posted that spoiler there in chat.

01:17:19.384 --> 01:17:19.604
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

01:17:21.690 --> 01:17:22.551
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see.

01:17:23.291 --> 01:17:27.694
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, apparently there was a LaserCats 2 on last night on the old Saturday Night Live.

01:17:27.754 --> 01:17:29.375
[SPEAKER_02]: It was LaserCats 2.

01:17:29.756 --> 01:17:30.116
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?

01:17:30.356 --> 01:17:31.717
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always LaserCats 2.

01:17:32.157 --> 01:17:33.038
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was a rerun then.

01:17:33.058 --> 01:17:34.459
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:17:34.639 --> 01:17:35.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's see.

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.021
[SPEAKER_03]: What else was there?

01:17:38.081 --> 01:17:40.463
[SPEAKER_03]: FireBoma says Rock and Roll High School sounds like a porno.

01:17:42.013 --> 01:17:45.254
[SPEAKER_03]: Solid Goomba says, Hamsters are proof God loves us.

01:17:45.774 --> 01:17:47.055
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the website... I agree.

01:17:47.215 --> 01:17:57.157
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, the company, Data Design Interactive, to be fair, they did put out E-Rake Extreme Metal Racing, which apparently is a pretty cool game.

01:17:57.217 --> 01:18:03.539
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it mixes heavy metal with racing, so... These guys sound like modern-day geniuses.

01:18:03.599 --> 01:18:05.580
[SPEAKER_03]: They know the types of games people want.

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.680
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't want Ninja Bread Man?

01:18:08.401 --> 01:18:09.541
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I don't know...

01:18:10.595 --> 01:18:13.376
[SPEAKER_03]: Please explain to me how this could possibly be a bad thing.

01:18:14.596 --> 01:18:17.316
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the UK, so, I mean... That's even better!

01:18:18.717 --> 01:18:20.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Jamie's gonna want him, too!

01:18:21.057 --> 01:18:24.058
[SPEAKER_02]: We can contact their project director.

01:18:24.078 --> 01:18:26.078
[SPEAKER_08]: The hamster thing just sounds dirty.

01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:28.639
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them on the show.

01:18:29.499 --> 01:18:30.459
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do whatever it takes.

01:18:31.799 --> 01:18:32.099
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:39.481
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is interesting, and this is one group that will not be playing...

01:18:43.843 --> 01:18:55.506
[SPEAKER_03]: What's basically going on is that there's this Christian group, and they call themselves the Porn Talk, which is backed by basically a faith-based ministry.

01:18:55.666 --> 01:19:02.567
[SPEAKER_03]: They've started a website that basically has this huge banner on it, and it says, We have a porn problem.

01:19:02.968 --> 01:19:05.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Porn safety facts for Nintendo's Wii gaming console.

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:08.049
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to visit the site, it's theporntalk.com.

01:19:09.039 --> 01:19:09.800
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:19:30.402 --> 01:19:48.733
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to also point out to the geniuses behind ThePornTalk.com that the computers you used to make ThePornTalk.com, that you're urging your kids to go check out to keep them away from porn, or, well, okay, I guess they're really not doing that, but you're urging parents to go check out to keep their kids away from porn, that device can also be used to access porn.

01:19:49.293 --> 01:19:52.915
[SPEAKER_03]: If your child has a cell phone, that can be used to access porn.

01:19:53.075 --> 01:19:53.956
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something funny, too.

01:19:54.016 --> 01:19:59.479
[SPEAKER_03]: If they have a dollar, or what is it, $3.95, that can be used to access porn.

01:19:59.927 --> 01:20:03.008
[SPEAKER_03]: at your local... Is somebody fucking racing outside?

01:20:03.028 --> 01:20:04.028
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I don't like having the window open.

01:20:04.048 --> 01:20:04.968
[SPEAKER_02]: In your apartment complex.

01:20:05.128 --> 01:20:06.669
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I gotta add this real quick.

01:20:06.749 --> 01:20:07.509
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:20:08.850 --> 01:20:12.891
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, imagine, if you will, they tell them, yeah, go to that porn talk site.

01:20:12.931 --> 01:20:16.092
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll teach you how to, you know, prevent, you know, seeing porn and stuff.

01:20:16.552 --> 01:20:16.872
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:20:17.092 --> 01:20:20.253
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't remember what the website name was, so they search for porn talk.

01:20:20.873 --> 01:20:21.273
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom!

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:21.773
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn!

01:20:21.793 --> 01:20:22.393
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go!

01:20:23.214 --> 01:20:28.295
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been... They've been, um... The porn beat them to the website, so...

01:20:29.369 --> 01:20:29.649
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:20:30.009 --> 01:20:35.230
[SPEAKER_03]: They're bragging on their site that Porn Talk won best in show at the Addy Awards and all this junk.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:36.751
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck's the Addy Awards?

01:20:36.771 --> 01:20:37.071
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:20:37.091 --> 01:20:37.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

01:20:38.491 --> 01:20:44.473
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the award show where we invited just us and we won because we're awesome.

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:47.273
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking about the Wii and Wi-Fi devices on the Porn Talk blog.

01:20:47.293 --> 01:20:53.495
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this issue and your suggestions on dealing with devices that come with internet capabilities.

01:20:53.936 --> 01:20:59.519
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be banning PCs next then and Macs and your cell phone.

01:20:59.639 --> 01:21:01.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you crawl into a cave?

01:21:02.341 --> 01:21:04.723
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just looking at some interesting comments on the actual site itself.

01:21:05.003 --> 01:21:06.864
[SPEAKER_03]: I figure these comments are posted publicly.

01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:08.705
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no problem with me reading them on air, correct?

01:21:09.686 --> 01:21:10.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Ray said...

01:21:11.013 --> 01:21:15.034
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for talking to your kids about porn, but the porntalk.com goes a little overboard.

01:21:15.415 --> 01:21:18.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Using filtering software on your 17-year-old is a little outrageous.

01:21:18.516 --> 01:21:20.536
[SPEAKER_03]: He or she will be in college the next year.

01:21:20.836 --> 01:21:22.237
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really want them so sheltered?

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:23.057
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll go crazy.

01:21:23.377 --> 01:21:29.699
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to mention the chances are your 17-year-old will know a lot more about computers than you and will have no problem getting any content they want.

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:34.241
[SPEAKER_03]: In related news, Ray is the OLR Not Listener of the Week.

01:21:39.042 --> 01:21:39.883
[SPEAKER_08]: Common sense, people.

01:21:39.943 --> 01:21:40.503
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking use it.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:48.423
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know there are ways to block the internet for your children.

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:49.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, don't download the thing.

01:21:51.785 --> 01:21:52.306
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

01:21:53.386 --> 01:21:55.748
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course that would involve the parents being involved.

01:21:55.888 --> 01:21:59.970
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's not going to ever happen.

01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:00.951
[SPEAKER_02]: That's never going to work.

01:22:00.991 --> 01:22:01.791
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

01:22:02.152 --> 01:22:04.513
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 makes an excellent point in chat.

01:22:04.813 --> 01:22:08.515
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 over at chat.orangelearnersradio.com says, Women have boobs.

01:22:08.976 --> 01:22:10.356
[SPEAKER_03]: Women are gateway to porn.

01:22:11.237 --> 01:22:11.637
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

01:22:12.038 --> 01:22:12.798
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all women's fault.

01:22:13.407 --> 01:22:14.468
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about that, DarkSakura?

01:22:15.308 --> 01:22:16.389
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yes, boobs.

01:22:16.869 --> 01:22:18.270
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's all of our fault.

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:23.913
[SPEAKER_08]: And while they're at it, how about putting live birth on TV too?

01:22:24.193 --> 01:22:25.874
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that shows off the coochie.

01:22:26.914 --> 01:22:30.776
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, don't they already have to show the miracle of life as part of education in schools?

01:22:31.317 --> 01:22:32.257
[SPEAKER_08]: Not if you live in Alabama.

01:22:32.297 --> 01:22:34.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was a gateway to pornography.

01:22:34.479 --> 01:22:40.722
[SPEAKER_03]: The minute I saw a baby flying out of that woman's vagina, I knew I never ever wanted to touch one.

01:22:44.132 --> 01:22:45.213
[SPEAKER_08]: Health Ed made you gay.

01:22:45.233 --> 01:22:50.836
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, sex education made me gay, I think, I don't know.

01:22:51.456 --> 01:23:05.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, obviously stories about these crazy people who go OMG porn and have these hair trigger reactions and this kind of crap get us angry, and when we get angry it's time for our FUs of the week.

01:23:17.569 --> 01:23:18.449
[SPEAKER_08]: My F.U.

01:23:18.469 --> 01:23:23.332
[SPEAKER_08]: of the Week goes towards people who say, you're not so-and-so, so you don't know.

01:23:24.312 --> 01:23:27.293
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you're not a parent, so you have no right to talk about children.

01:23:28.974 --> 01:23:30.955
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm intelligent.

01:23:31.515 --> 01:23:32.235
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a brain.

01:23:32.336 --> 01:23:33.176
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm observant.

01:23:33.896 --> 01:23:34.997
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had little brothers.

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:43.380
[SPEAKER_08]: As a human being and as a woman who may one day give birth to children... Shiver.

01:23:44.621 --> 01:23:46.742
[SPEAKER_03]: Not you, just the baby flying out of your vagina.

01:23:48.619 --> 01:23:52.342
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that completely discounts anything that you have to say.

01:23:52.682 --> 01:24:04.111
[SPEAKER_08]: When people start off with, you don't know because you are not, you know, that instantly removes all credibility from any argument that you might have by, because you're trying to immediately dismiss the other party.

01:24:05.131 --> 01:24:08.394
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't put you in a superior position, that puts you in a position of ignorance.

01:24:08.474 --> 01:24:09.394
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking shut your mouth.

01:24:10.956 --> 01:24:11.256
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

01:24:12.417 --> 01:24:12.777
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki!

01:24:13.878 --> 01:24:13.978
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:21.655
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess FUV or Apartment Complex for not actually having lines in the parking lot so everyone has to kind of guess to where the cars are supposed to be.

01:24:22.395 --> 01:24:23.236
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of sucks.

01:24:23.376 --> 01:24:33.803
[SPEAKER_02]: And have you noticed that none of these blogs that point out the porn on the PSP and porn on the Wii and stuff, nobody's talking about the PlayStation 3 at all.

01:24:33.823 --> 01:24:34.784
[SPEAKER_02]: No one owns a PlayStation 3.

01:24:35.925 --> 01:24:36.565
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:24:37.426 --> 01:24:39.547
[SPEAKER_02]: So more porn for me, and in high definition.

01:24:39.747 --> 01:24:40.568
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hell yeah.

01:24:40.588 --> 01:24:40.668
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:48.464
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob D in chat says, I like how Sky makes it sound like vaginas are rocket launchers.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:50.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in a way they kind of are.

01:24:52.507 --> 01:24:52.907
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, Jamie?

01:24:54.148 --> 01:24:54.548
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

01:24:55.309 --> 01:24:55.569
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:24:55.889 --> 01:25:04.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, my FU of the week goes to lack of sleep because I swear like every night this week I got maybe four hours of sleep at the most.

01:25:04.155 --> 01:25:05.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, granted, that's my own downfall.

01:25:05.616 --> 01:25:06.237
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're thinking.

01:25:06.497 --> 01:25:07.358
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to bed early, Rob.

01:25:07.378 --> 01:25:07.818
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know.

01:25:08.632 --> 01:25:11.493
[SPEAKER_03]: There's such good TV on at 2 in the morning.

01:25:11.513 --> 01:25:12.154
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

01:25:12.214 --> 01:25:13.694
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just, you know, for circumstances.

01:25:13.974 --> 01:25:17.336
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just exhausted yesterday when Jamie and I were running around San Francisco yesterday.

01:25:17.356 --> 01:25:19.117
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so tired I thought I was going to pass out.

01:25:19.137 --> 01:25:21.157
[SPEAKER_03]: I slept for 11 hours last night.

01:25:21.678 --> 01:25:23.058
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel pretty good today.

01:25:23.078 --> 01:25:24.739
[SPEAKER_03]: A bit groggy from oversleeping.

01:25:25.359 --> 01:25:26.440
[SPEAKER_03]: So FU to lack of sleep.

01:25:28.741 --> 01:25:29.581
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

01:25:30.161 --> 01:25:31.122
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess left.

01:25:31.482 --> 01:25:32.202
[SPEAKER_03]: LankyStyle left.

01:25:32.242 --> 01:25:33.383
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're the only ones in studio.

01:25:33.423 --> 01:25:36.444
[SPEAKER_03]: So back to the gaming news then since there's no more FUs of the week.

01:25:37.256 --> 01:25:38.136
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:25:55.697 --> 01:26:09.765
[SPEAKER_08]: took a survey of 1,000 drivers between the ages of 16 to 24 about video games, how it's affecting their driving habits, and the results stated 27% admitted to taking more risks on the road after playing a racing game.

01:26:11.426 --> 01:26:14.267
[SPEAKER_08]: And a quarter saying they pretend they're actually in a video game when they drive.

01:26:16.609 --> 01:26:21.592
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying that that's an indisputable link between gaming and dangerous driving.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:42.786
[SPEAKER_08]: What they're not really paying attention to is that if they're interviewing people between the ages of 16 and 24, chances are that your audience is not going to be very fucking mature and not going to have the skill to know about, you know, how to drive properly.

01:26:44.487 --> 01:26:47.288
[SPEAKER_03]: It's... You're dying to say something over there, Loki.

01:26:47.868 --> 01:26:50.909
[SPEAKER_02]: What they fail to mention is all those people that said they drive recklessly, women.

01:26:52.461 --> 01:26:58.449
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, then again, I mean, I can't imagine too many of them actually, 27%, yeah, that sounds about right.

01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:00.352
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:02.380
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:05.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, even if they weren't playing video games, they'd still be crashing into this shit.

01:27:05.941 --> 01:27:09.582
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God, people talking on their cell phones, drifting in and out of lanes.

01:27:10.143 --> 01:27:12.863
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the funniest thing happened to me today.

01:27:13.404 --> 01:27:14.404
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought food.

01:27:14.944 --> 01:27:16.164
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:21.466
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, people are dying and just like totally oblivious to the fucking world.

01:27:21.606 --> 01:27:23.327
[SPEAKER_02]: How did I end up in this river?

01:27:24.047 --> 01:27:26.147
[SPEAKER_02]: They totally jumped out in front of me.

01:27:26.348 --> 01:27:30.449
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like... I think anything that...

01:27:32.452 --> 01:27:36.154
[SPEAKER_08]: has an effect on your reaction.

01:27:36.174 --> 01:27:43.999
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if you have a predisposition toward anger or nervousness, that's what's going to, I think, more affect how you drive.

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.321
[SPEAKER_08]: Not so much the game.

01:27:47.381 --> 01:27:56.566
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's just, that's really, I mean, even when I was a new driver, you know, playing hard driving didn't make me want to go out and do the loop on the road.

01:27:57.007 --> 01:27:59.288
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, hard driving, you were driving super damn slow.

01:27:59.308 --> 01:28:01.069
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it felt slow in the game.

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:04.921
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not playing a driving video game that makes you want to drive fast.

01:28:04.981 --> 01:28:09.702
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fucking Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 2 soundtrack that makes you want to drive fast.

01:28:11.042 --> 01:28:14.842
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck yeah.

01:28:15.583 --> 01:28:18.023
[SPEAKER_02]: Try and catch me now, fucking coppers.

01:28:18.863 --> 01:28:19.283
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:28:19.403 --> 01:28:28.785
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be a little bit serious here, I would think if anything, playing video games would help you drive better because you're actually going to have a faster reaction time.

01:28:29.529 --> 01:28:34.651
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, from games, they've actually helped you improve your reaction time a little bit, I would think.

01:28:35.351 --> 01:28:39.293
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whatever, it's a fucking survey.

01:28:39.873 --> 01:28:40.653
[SPEAKER_02]: Surveys suck.

01:28:42.094 --> 01:28:44.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Survey says you suck.

01:28:45.655 --> 01:28:53.578
[SPEAKER_02]: So, funny you should be playing, um, you know, that kind of music, but, um, Yuzo Kishiro is going to be DJing play, um,

01:28:55.561 --> 01:29:01.723
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the concert in June, he's going to be DJing, I believe it's the concert in Japan?

01:29:01.963 --> 01:29:03.603
[SPEAKER_02]: No, in Singapore.

01:29:04.064 --> 01:29:05.624
[SPEAKER_03]: I better start driving to Singapore.

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:13.546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Rob, drive to Singapore.

01:29:14.807 --> 01:29:16.747
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the ocean, that would be awesome.

01:29:17.447 --> 01:29:19.448
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll drive so fast I'll float on the water, come on.

01:29:21.002 --> 01:29:21.582
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

01:29:22.243 --> 01:29:25.385
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe you'll just fart so hard you'll float over the water.

01:29:26.526 --> 01:29:36.932
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought that was pretty cool, and he's done such music from Streets of Rage, Revenge of Shinobi, Actraiser, Castlevania Portrait of Ruin, lots of stuff.

01:29:38.513 --> 01:29:39.774
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to be spinning some tracks.

01:29:40.594 --> 01:29:43.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad he's not coming over here, just in Singapore.

01:29:43.796 --> 01:29:45.757
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, Bandit is my new best friend in chat.

01:29:46.358 --> 01:29:48.539
[SPEAKER_03]: If Sonic can do it, why can't Sky?

01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:49.820
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

01:29:50.419 --> 01:29:52.641
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic is a fictional blue hedgehog.

01:29:53.842 --> 01:29:55.903
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think hedgehogs move that fast anyways.

01:29:57.605 --> 01:29:58.385
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just pokey.

01:30:01.268 --> 01:30:03.069
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was irony or something.

01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:07.613
[SPEAKER_03]: And hamster heroes, is there a hamster that runs real fast?

01:30:08.093 --> 01:30:09.954
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but there's one that looks like Batman.

01:30:10.495 --> 01:30:12.116
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, this is the best game ever!

01:30:14.418 --> 01:30:15.399
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking hamsters...

01:30:16.178 --> 01:30:18.380
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever had a hamster?

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.121
[SPEAKER_03]: In grade school.

01:30:20.161 --> 01:30:23.743
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember whenever you go in the classroom that has a hamster, it smells like poop.

01:30:24.044 --> 01:30:26.605
[SPEAKER_03]: And they poop out pellets, which I always thought was amusing.

01:30:26.625 --> 01:30:29.047
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you a story about hamsters real quick.

01:30:29.107 --> 01:30:30.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Hamsters are retarded.

01:30:30.748 --> 01:30:35.472
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason you would own a hamster is to watch how retarded it is.

01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:36.893
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a hamster.

01:30:36.913 --> 01:30:40.095
[SPEAKER_02]: We named him Sam because it was squeaks and moves.

01:30:40.155 --> 01:30:41.816
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically what it stood for.

01:30:41.876 --> 01:30:42.877
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so creative.

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:45.519
[SPEAKER_02]: The hamster would spin...

01:30:46.303 --> 01:30:47.443
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.182
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Wii game I want.

01:31:17.202 --> 01:31:23.306
[SPEAKER_02]: They sit there, their feet fucking up in the air, pull the poop out of their ass, and they throw it.

01:31:25.688 --> 01:31:27.289
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the weirdest thing to see.

01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:30.171
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys don't understand why I'm laughing so hard.

01:31:30.632 --> 01:31:36.696
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, and thank God this isn't TV, but Loki actually put his feet up in the air.

01:31:39.313 --> 01:31:43.154
[SPEAKER_04]: and reached for it and did the motion like the hamster does.

01:31:43.654 --> 01:31:45.574
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob's all red in the face and adorable.

01:31:47.195 --> 01:31:49.695
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, we need a TV show just for moments like that.

01:31:49.715 --> 01:31:50.455
[SPEAKER_08]: The hell we do.

01:31:51.855 --> 01:31:53.296
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have a hamster on the TV show.

01:31:53.856 --> 01:31:54.476
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a cape on him.

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:56.936
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that should be our new mascot as a hamster.

01:31:56.956 --> 01:31:59.757
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, they only live about a year or two, so it's not worth it.

01:31:59.797 --> 01:32:03.578
[SPEAKER_02]: And every single one of them dies from cancer, so I'm not even worried.

01:32:05.078 --> 01:32:06.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even worth it.

01:32:07.076 --> 01:32:07.376
[SPEAKER_03]: HamsterDance

01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:56.848
[SPEAKER_03]: and let's see that's coming out for $30 and that by the way originally showed up in Japan in September of 2005 so it's like one of those hey it's about freaking time we got that over here it was supposed to come out last year around August as well but then company it switched company XS Game dropped it so yeah whatever anyhow it should be noted though that Raiden 4 is coming out on Xbox 360 for those of you unfamiliar with the franchise it's just one of those shooter games that you know a lot of people love so there you go

01:32:57.899 --> 01:32:59.400
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence Online Servers

01:33:27.644 --> 01:33:28.945
[SPEAKER_08]: is going bye-bye.

01:33:29.465 --> 01:33:32.347
[SPEAKER_08]: As of April 2nd, it will be gone.

01:33:34.108 --> 01:33:35.909
[SPEAKER_08]: The community is not big enough.

01:33:38.051 --> 01:33:47.857
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the user community for the game, those who are loyal to it, are putting up internet petitions to try to keep it up, but it's in the category of not fucking lightly.

01:33:49.158 --> 01:33:49.358
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

01:33:49.558 --> 01:33:49.758
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:51.600
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like if it works.

01:33:51.861 --> 01:33:55.943
[SPEAKER_03]: Petitions don't usually magically fix everything, but I know that's got to suck to get the plug pulled.

01:33:56.203 --> 01:33:58.704
[SPEAKER_03]: Music game fans got Amplitude's plug pulled on them.

01:33:59.024 --> 01:34:02.026
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, Amplitude came out like five years ago.

01:34:02.386 --> 01:34:05.988
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Substance 3, Substance, I can never remember.

01:34:06.008 --> 01:34:06.408
[SPEAKER_02]: About a year ago.

01:34:06.948 --> 01:34:07.949
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not that old.

01:34:08.069 --> 01:34:08.629
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in March.

01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:09.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Substance.

01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:10.570
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it, Substance.

01:34:11.210 --> 01:34:15.092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and to be honest, it just didn't sell that well and not many people used it online.

01:34:15.152 --> 01:34:19.094
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what you get when you have, you know, fucking networks that are run by each individual company.

01:34:19.134 --> 01:34:20.355
[SPEAKER_02]: So one centralized network,

01:34:21.024 --> 01:34:22.185
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:34:47.984 --> 01:34:49.204
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:35:12.210 --> 01:35:23.338
[SPEAKER_02]: including some photon whips and slicers, new stages, even a casino and apparently the casino is run by penguin-esque Rappies.

01:35:23.538 --> 01:35:24.839
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should go back to PSU.

01:35:26.941 --> 01:35:27.621
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds neat.

01:35:28.282 --> 01:35:28.902
[SPEAKER_03]: I like penguins.

01:35:28.942 --> 01:35:31.844
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Rappies.

01:35:32.125 --> 01:35:37.909
[SPEAKER_08]: Rappies, no, if you've done the Rappie holiday quest, you will never like Rappies again.

01:35:38.601 --> 01:35:43.803
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I believe is still going in the Fantasy Star Online, or the old PSO.

01:35:44.143 --> 01:35:50.125
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the Christmas Quest is still going on the Xbox One, as it has been for the past, not 360, but the regular Xbox.

01:35:50.265 --> 01:35:53.066
[SPEAKER_08]: It was going on Blue Burst for like six months.

01:35:53.086 --> 01:35:53.786
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seriously.

01:35:54.367 --> 01:35:55.067
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, jeez.

01:35:55.387 --> 01:35:55.987
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

01:35:56.327 --> 01:35:58.328
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all, oh crap, we still have that game.

01:35:59.048 --> 01:35:59.368
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

01:36:00.069 --> 01:36:03.610
[SPEAKER_08]: And for anyone who'd like to know, I quit PSU last week.

01:36:04.990 --> 01:36:06.231
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

01:36:06.491 --> 01:36:06.951
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, congratulations.

01:36:07.655 --> 01:36:12.957
[SPEAKER_08]: That goes to show just what my opinion of PSU is.

01:36:13.057 --> 01:36:18.918
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing World of Warcraft and I'm trying to get Jamie to join our little guild we've got going on Ravencrest.

01:36:19.838 --> 01:36:20.699
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I talked her into it.

01:36:20.759 --> 01:36:23.379
[SPEAKER_08]: How about when I have time and when someone gets me Burning Crusade?

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.580
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, how about we take a break?

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:27.681
[SPEAKER_03]: I like breaks.

01:36:28.161 --> 01:36:36.083
[SPEAKER_03]: A break, and when we come back we'll have more of Orange Lounge Radio, more hilarious things coming out of Loki's mouth and other orifices probably.

01:36:37.142 --> 01:36:40.523
[SPEAKER_03]: in the next part, Part B. Because we have a lot of 360 news we haven't gotten to yet.

01:36:40.804 --> 01:36:48.806
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see you back in a little bit for Orange Lounge Radio Part B. Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

01:36:49.266 --> 01:36:53.588
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
