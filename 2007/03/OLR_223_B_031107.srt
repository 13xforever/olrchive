00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:19,088

2
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:22,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:47,948
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

4
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:17,631
[SPEAKER_12]: And how Sony's winning a lot of people back over thanks to their announcements about home Well, what about Nintendo?

5
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:37,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Nintendo basically made only two unveilings in their conference at GDC And that was a new Mario Galaxy trailer and the fact that it would be out this year And a type of, I don't know what you'd want to call it, Mii Idol or something like that Basically a, do you like this Mii, it's like a Mii popularity channel

6
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:39,659
[SPEAKER_12]: has been announced for the Nintendo Wii.

7
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:48,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Not a lot of announcements outside of that, but then again, a lot of people are saying, ah, Nintendo, you guys suck, Sony made all these announcements, and Nintendo, you didn't do crap.

8
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:51,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, keep in mind, folks, it was Game Developers Conference.

9
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:52,928
[SPEAKER_12]: What did Miyamoto talk about?

10
00:01:53,209 --> 00:02:01,455
[SPEAKER_12]: He talked about the waifu meter, he talked about how Mario 128 kind of evolved into the game Pikmin, he talked about game development types of things.

11
00:02:01,935 --> 00:02:04,437
[SPEAKER_12]: On that end, Nintendo really didn't disappoint, I don't think.

12
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:11,324
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, if you were there looking for the E3 Bangin' Fireworks press conference, I guess you were going to be a little disappointed.

13
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:16,086
[SPEAKER_12]: But, of course, we remember that story last week that said, hey, Nintendo's got some stock things going on.

14
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:19,708
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not going to be able to make any big announcements at GDC, whether they want to or not.

15
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:21,149
[SPEAKER_12]: So, there you have it.

16
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:25,011
[SPEAKER_12]: So, unfortunately, the only little trinkets you got there from Nintendo were those two things.

17
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,292
[SPEAKER_12]: But, curious, what do you guys think about that?

18
00:02:27,332 --> 00:02:29,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Did either of you guys watch the new Galaxy trailer?

19
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:30,073
[SPEAKER_12]: What did you think of it?

20
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

21
00:02:46,747 --> 00:03:15,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Mario Galaxy because it looks like you can flip 2D to 3D at a touch of a button like if you're playing the 2D thing and like you see a wheel thing like there was one video I saw like a wheel spiked wheel was coming at you you hit a button to go to 3D and then you can run around the wheel and then you go back to the 2D mode it's so crazy I liked it it was very cool so that was something I'm looking forward to way more than any of the other stuff that was talked about unfortunately I don't know Smash Brothers I'll give Mario Galaxy a try of course I want my Smash Brothers we'll see

22
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:19,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, if you want to give your comments in chat, it's chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

23
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,460
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the second time I've done this show.

24
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:22,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

25
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,982
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm out of it tonight.

26
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:25,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Something's wrong.

27
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:27,823
[SPEAKER_12]: There's something in the water I'm drinking tonight.

28
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:30,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

29
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:34,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft says, Super Paper Mario for the win.

30
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:38,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Blackwolf was at Game Developers Conference and played Super Paper Mario.

31
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:40,406
[SPEAKER_12]: He says, Super Paper Mario equals fun.

32
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:42,147
[SPEAKER_12]: The A button goes to 3D.

33
00:03:43,587 --> 00:04:12,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Joshi says Super Paper Mario is when I get a Wii so it looks like a lot of folks are very excited SSJ100Matt says yay more channels but how about Galaxy, Smash, and Metroid there's your comments from chat anyways this week we saw some pretty good stuff coming to the virtual console including Super Ghouls and Ghosts and that was of course very fucking hard as usual and of course Sword of Vermillion um

34
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,832
[SPEAKER_09]: and Elevator Action for the, well, that was on the NES.

35
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:20,235
[SPEAKER_09]: And this week, though, what are we going to be getting?

36
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:25,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, from what I've been hearing, I think Sonic Spinball was among those.

37
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:30,681
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it was on the Japan launch there, at least what they're getting this week.

38
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:36,205
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I remember correctly, they also were getting Excitebike and Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

39
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,887
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was on the website, yeah.

40
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:39,668
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe that is on its way.

41
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:08,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they saw Spinball there too, if I remember correctly.

42
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:09,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

43
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:10,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember.

44
00:05:11,263 --> 00:05:16,144
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, you're going to expect about three games tomorrow or Monday.

45
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:19,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything on Virtual Console that you were dying for still not out?

46
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,526
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I got Kid Icarus, so I kind of got my wish.

47
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:22,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I have R-Type.

48
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:25,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know, but anything not out that you still want?

49
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:32,548
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, obviously Guardian Legend, but realistically something from either Nintendo itself or one of their very close third-party developers.

50
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:33,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Snow Brothers.

51
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:34,029
[SPEAKER_12]: Snow Brothers.

52
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:35,409
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an interesting choice.

53
00:05:36,018 --> 00:05:37,099
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember that game, actually.

54
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,923
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to see, and I know Jamie hates this one, but I really like Strider on the NES.

55
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:45,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say I hated it.

56
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:48,687
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually, the game was based off of the Strider manga.

57
00:05:49,207 --> 00:05:49,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

58
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:52,730
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought you told me once you hated it because the arcade one is so much better.

59
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say I hate it, just the arcade one is so much better.

60
00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:58,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Wouldn't it be neat, though, one week to get Strider on NES and Strider on Genesis?

61
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:00,475
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be kind of cool, wouldn't it?

62
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:00,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

63
00:06:01,256 --> 00:06:01,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

64
00:06:02,388 --> 00:06:03,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Mega Man would be my other wish.

65
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:05,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they need some Mega Man games on there.

66
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:06,509
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be pretty cool.

67
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:09,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, Capcom just needs some more stuff on there.

68
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think it would be pretty cool.

69
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a fan of this game, at least.

70
00:06:14,491 --> 00:06:15,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Uniracers?

71
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:16,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

72
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,312
[SPEAKER_09]: No one really played that game for Nintendo.

73
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,932
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking at chat room here.

74
00:06:20,352 --> 00:06:21,912
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, you bring up Virtual Console.

75
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:23,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone makes their list of demands.

76
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:25,033
[SPEAKER_12]: James Patrick says Secret of Mana.

77
00:06:25,447 --> 00:06:26,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Secret of Mana, and Evermore.

78
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:29,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Mori says Earthbound, please.

79
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:30,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Ryoma says Ice Climbers.

80
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, Ice Climbers is already up.

81
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:32,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Go check it out.

82
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,411
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless he was referring to something else, but I think that's what it was.

83
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:36,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Salamander.

84
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:39,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Life Force in this country, but yeah, that would be cool.

85
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:41,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft says Kirby Superstar.

86
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,113
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

87
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:46,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Mel B on our staff says Tecmo Bowl, but will it be licensed?

88
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:46,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Not likely.

89
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:51,677
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they should just leave it in there with the old, like, 88 lineup or whatever that game had in it.

90
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:52,277
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be funny.

91
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:53,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't it?

92
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:54,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

93
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:54,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm-hmm.

94
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:59,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Then you could still play us the 49ers and actually be good because it's 1988.

95
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:03,169
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a sports joke.

96
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:04,269
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't make those very often.

97
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:07,030
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a sports joke for you guys out there.

98
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:16,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for those who are disgusted with Rob's sports jokes, no, not really.

99
00:07:16,532 --> 00:07:18,592
[SPEAKER_05]: This has absolutely nothing to do with sports.

100
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,913
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Chocobo Tales coming out in...

101
00:07:21,798 --> 00:07:37,610
[SPEAKER_05]: May in the UK, that is, it's coming out April 3rd here in the US, but you play as a chocobo, and you have to, you know, stop the bad guy from, you know, I guess being all evil, even though he's all evil.

102
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:49,559
[SPEAKER_05]: So you go around and you do minigames, and you build up a deck in card battles and save the universe on your DS through the Wi-Fi.

103
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,401
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um,

104
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy 2 U.S.

105
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Forge of Japan

106
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:23,819
[SPEAKER_12]: You would have to use the big carrot when it came up on the screen and said, Smells like Chocobo.

107
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,661
[SPEAKER_12]: And you kind of always wondered, what the hell does a Chocobo smell like?

108
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Does it smell like farts or roses or what?

109
00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:29,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Smells like chicken shit.

110
00:08:30,604 --> 00:08:31,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Kentucky Fried Chicken?

111
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:32,225
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

112
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:34,647
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's Kentucky Faraga Chocobo.

113
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:35,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

114
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:37,525
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

115
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:06,766
[SPEAKER_12]: No price announced here yet, but I guess based off those prices, you could speculate $34, $39.99, right?

116
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,328
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be a fair statement.

117
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:15,390
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess something to compete with the PSP a little bit, although this is not included with the DS.

118
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,471
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of something extra.

119
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:21,693
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you've ever wanted to surf the Internet while on the go on your DS, there you have it.

120
00:09:23,454 --> 00:09:24,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I would not buy that.

121
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:26,876
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not feeling this.

122
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:27,736
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really not.

123
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:29,237
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what would have been cool?

124
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:34,292
[SPEAKER_12]: If I had the internet channel on my Wii, then I could beam it over to my DS.

125
00:09:34,612 --> 00:09:36,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever happened to that functionality?

126
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:39,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Wasn't that something they said you could do at one point?

127
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:41,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the DS would interface with the Wii?

128
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:45,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're going to have that with some future games, but they may add that later.

129
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,362
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a feeling that's something up their sleeve.

130
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:50,864
[SPEAKER_12]: DS demos on your Wii a little later on.

131
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:51,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Why not?

132
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:52,765
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

133
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:57,629
[SPEAKER_09]: But one thing I was going to say is I think that they've done this probably better at homebrew.

134
00:09:57,649 --> 00:09:57,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

135
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:08,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, the only problem and the reason why they don't have a lot of the Flash support and stuff is because there's not enough RAM in the system and there's no storage.

136
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:12,405
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just pretty much the cart itself, which doesn't hold that much.

137
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:19,448
[SPEAKER_09]: And you would probably need to have some sort of Game Boy Advance thing plugged in the bottom.

138
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,128
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I think that's what they did in Japan.

139
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:23,369
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple different versions of that, so...

140
00:10:24,305 --> 00:10:27,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Joshi16 wants to know, is there going to be an OLR DS page?

141
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Since we have the PSP page and a Wii one in the works.

142
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably not.

143
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that many people are going to be using that.

144
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe like five people would use it, if even that.

145
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:38,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we even have five listeners of Orange Launch Radio?

146
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:42,956
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we do, actually, so I don't think there'd be a lot of point to do that.

147
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:45,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Five listeners of Orange Launch Radio?

148
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:46,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

149
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:49,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have more than that.

150
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe a handful, I don't know.

151
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:55,387
[SPEAKER_12]: The first episode we only had five listeners, but my how we've grown since then.

152
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:58,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys so much for supporting us over the years.

153
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:00,751
[SPEAKER_12]: You know our fifth anniversary is coming up in just two months.

154
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:06,274
[SPEAKER_12]: Two months is the station, but I think we're actually going to celebrate it with the first live show, which was June 23rd, 2002.

155
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:08,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

156
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:14,820
[SPEAKER_09]: So last week we talked about how the Wii didn't have me support for third parties.

157
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:22,196
[SPEAKER_09]: And now this week, SNK's president says that they're not letting third parties have online capabilities either.

158
00:11:24,357 --> 00:11:31,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is funny, because Sega's got a Pachinko game coming out that does have online and does have Mii support.

159
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:37,299
[SPEAKER_09]: So I basically ask, are they just not letting SNK have online support or Mii support?

160
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:41,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Because to be honest, I mean, and I'm sure everyone can agree with me,

161
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,500
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

162
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:17,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, let's go on to another topic, shall we?

163
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:26,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is something that we've been, of course, talking about since the announcement of having our E3 taken from us.

164
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:33,637
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is going to be E3 this year, if you were invited, it's July 11th through 13th.

165
00:12:35,402 --> 00:12:46,753
[SPEAKER_05]: To quote the invite, it says, The opportunity to engage in one-on-one meetings with leading game company executives in an intimate setting as well as network, socialize, and test pilot major company offerings.

166
00:12:48,494 --> 00:12:49,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I got invited.

167
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations.

168
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:56,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if it works out for me, I'm going to go.

169
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,223
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm actually...

170
00:12:58,274 --> 00:13:03,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of do see more now of the logic and them changing it to more of a meeting base.

171
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:05,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're still going to have the demos and such.

172
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:10,122
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not going to be the big over-the-top production that E3 was in the past.

173
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:14,084
[SPEAKER_09]: And not really many people have figured out why people are getting invited.

174
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:15,805
[SPEAKER_12]: I was actually looking just earlier today.

175
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:18,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Joystick ran an interesting story on the whole thing.

176
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:24,731
[SPEAKER_12]: And apparently they're saying, they said here in the story, this week that some journalists received their invites, but many did not.

177
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:25,952
[SPEAKER_12]: And interesting enough,

178
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie did get an invite, and so did someone else on our staff who works behind the scenes.

179
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:32,846
[SPEAKER_12]: But Loki and I have not.

180
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:36,189
[SPEAKER_12]: So where's the love, you guys?

181
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,612
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's some developers out there that listen to us.

182
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:40,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Sniff, sniff, cry, cry.

183
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:40,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Send us an email.

184
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:41,554
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to go.

185
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:43,016
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll interview you, have you on the show.

186
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:45,038
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll play Beat the Host with you.

187
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,279
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll bring our rig.

188
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,741
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but I do hope...

189
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,513
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

190
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:13,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

191
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:26,232
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like a lot of times we didn't go to... I mean, we went to meetings for some things, but I got a lot of accomplishments with booth tours and stuff like that and actually meeting people face-to-face instead of just actually having meetings and stuff.

192
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:27,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob went to meetings with me.

193
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,414
[SPEAKER_12]: At this point, it's really all speculation.

194
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:31,735
[SPEAKER_12]: We just don't know how they're picking it.

195
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:33,936
[SPEAKER_05]: It might also have to do with how you registered.

196
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:36,549
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

197
00:14:56,252 --> 00:15:00,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Shifting gears completely here, going from E3 to talk about politics a little bit.

198
00:15:00,836 --> 00:15:06,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Game Politics ran a story earlier this week about the video games made me do it defense.

199
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:20,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, apparently what happened is that this 19-year-old Patrick Morris actually shot his 15-year-old boy with a shotgun and used the good old excuse, the video games made me do it.

200
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:26,276
[SPEAKER_12]: and his mom even tried to go in there and say, he would just go into his room and play those video games.

201
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:33,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the prosecution brought out Dr. Michael Knapp from Ashland, Oregon, and he said it was ridiculous to blame video games.

202
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:42,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Moreover, he said while you usually can't predict violent behavior, other risk factors in Morris' life, such as his drug use and emotional disorders, were much stronger factors.

203
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:48,029
[SPEAKER_12]: So after 30 minutes of deliberations, the judge sentenced Morris to life imprisonment

204
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:49,992
[SPEAKER_12]: in prison.

205
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:51,233
[SPEAKER_12]: The video games made me do it.

206
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:52,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Defense carried no weight.

207
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:53,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha!

208
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:57,858
[SPEAKER_12]: As well, it should have not had any weight because that's a stupid defense.

209
00:15:58,118 --> 00:15:59,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it was the hip-hop music that did it.

210
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,601
[SPEAKER_09]: No one made you press the power button, asshole.

211
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:04,763
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the hip-hop music game that made me do it.

212
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:06,664
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all Def Jam Icon's fault.

213
00:16:06,684 --> 00:16:08,405
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Def Jam Icon, absolutely.

214
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:11,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but anyway.

215
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:17,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, if anything makes me want to go out and get a shotgun and shoot people, it would probably be Sonic on the PlayStation 3.

216
00:16:18,132 --> 00:16:18,913
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know about you.

217
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Please don't take me literally.

218
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:22,802
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you guys know I'm joking.

219
00:16:24,223 --> 00:16:34,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sometimes we talk about harming the certain beta testers of online functions in, say, portable Grand Theft Auto games.

220
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:37,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you fucking sucked at it.

221
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:48,783
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyways, one thing, though, that's going to make people, especially Sega, make some more games is this online poll that they have where they're trying to figure out the interests of...

222
00:16:50,236 --> 00:16:51,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Night would be awesome

223
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:23,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I think it would be really good, though, to move on to something else that doesn't have to do with video game news.

224
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

225
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, Rob?

226
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:26,381
[SPEAKER_12]: What would that be?

227
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:27,442
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be the mailbag.

228
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:31,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah, but don't our emailers sometimes email us with video game-related things?

229
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:31,605
[SPEAKER_12]: I would hope so.

230
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes, but I ignore it.

231
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:33,207
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

232
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:36,349
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, let's open up the old mailbag and see what's in store.

233
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,371
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

234
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:40,793
All right.

235
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:49,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's first email actually comes from GrinWithoutACat.

236
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

237
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:04,606
[SPEAKER_05]: and 45 million sold in Europe.

238
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:10,835
[SPEAKER_05]: The slimline model is actually sold better in Europe than anywhere else, with 18 million against North America's 16 million and Japan's 6 million.

239
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:18,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe also seems to be the one who takes a mis-interest in their casual and innovative games such as iToy, SingStar, and Buzz, a quiz game with buzzer peripherals.

240
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:19,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

241
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:41,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching.

242
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,030
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time.

243
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:01,564
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

244
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:08,548
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like every week we're getting some type of email from a European listener, and understandably so, don't get me wrong.

245
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:13,792
[SPEAKER_12]: But a European listener who's a little bit upset because they're constantly getting screwed by the game companies.

246
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:16,674
[SPEAKER_12]: So unfortunately I don't have an easy answer for you on that one.

247
00:19:17,254 --> 00:19:18,115
[SPEAKER_12]: But thank you for the insight.

248
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:19,036
[SPEAKER_12]: We do appreciate that.

249
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:22,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was actually a very well thought out email.

250
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:23,919
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for sending it.

251
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:27,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Next one comes up is from BearWhoDriveCar.

252
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:30,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Please make Sky stop attempting accents, especially British.

253
00:19:30,366 --> 00:19:30,766
[SPEAKER_05]: That is all.

254
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:34,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't know what you're talking about.

255
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:36,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, your accent really is awful.

256
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Carry on.

257
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like to go out and have some tea?

258
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:39,533
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really awful.

259
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:42,655
[SPEAKER_11]: BearWhoDriveCar, would you like to go out and have some tea?

260
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:43,516
[SPEAKER_11]: A spot of tea?

261
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:46,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are you going to continue to be a tit?

262
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up comes from Cy.

263
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:51,522
[SPEAKER_05]: This is DearOLR.

264
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:52,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Grin.

265
00:19:52,737 --> 00:20:00,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, on my World of Warcraft server, there's a guild called LessQQMorePewPew.

266
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:02,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Just thought it was funny.

267
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:03,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Love the show.

268
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:03,706
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys rock.

269
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:04,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff like that.

270
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,549
[SPEAKER_12]: The OLR guild is on Ravencrest, by the way.

271
00:20:07,569 --> 00:20:10,151
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want more information, go to the forums.

272
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:13,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Although that is a great name for a guild, LessQQMorePewPew.

273
00:20:13,554 --> 00:20:14,915
[SPEAKER_12]: I should look that up on the armory.

274
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:18,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So how about this?

275
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:20,980
[SPEAKER_05]: This one comes from Ali.

276
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,603
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought I would voice a few opinions on your cynicism toward the PS3.

277
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:29,966
[SPEAKER_05]: My brother had the opportunity to play a PS3 a couple of days ago, and he told me it was really a lot of fun.

278
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe he played Resistance, Fall of Man, and Gran Turismo HD.

279
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Now granted, my brother is a pretty hardcore gamer.

280
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,673
[SPEAKER_05]: He pulled strings to get himself an Xbox 360 at launch, got a PS2 at launch, etc.

281
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:42,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I thought I would remind you of the PS2 launch.

282
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:47,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone told us we were crazy for spending that much on a game system, and the Dreamcast was so much better.

283
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:53,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I also remember reading that the emotion engine was nigh impossible to program for.

284
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:56,097
[SPEAKER_05]: However, once time passed, the PS2 gained traction price-wise.

285
00:20:56,497 --> 00:21:02,460
[SPEAKER_05]: The price stayed even as Flint inflation went on, and people cracked how to get the most out of their EE.

286
00:21:03,141 --> 00:21:04,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, look at the PS3.

287
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:10,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone says the 360 is 100 times better, that the cell is near impossible to program for, and that it was too expensive.

288
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:11,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that will happen in a year or two.

289
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,546
[SPEAKER_05]: The PS2 will see a revival and will take the market.

290
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:20,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, I literally got my 360 a half hour ago, and I got Crackdown, Call of Duty 3, Gears of War, Saints Row, and Test Drive Unlimited.

291
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:24,067
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason I'm telling you this is that I want some music games.

292
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:29,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that DDR for 360 wasn't too good, and as far as I can tell, Guitar Hero 2 is not on Xbox 360.

293
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:33,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Will Guitar Hero come out for the Xbox 360, and is DDR any good on 360?

294
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it is coming out on 360.

295
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:38,172
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe April is the big month for Guitar Hero 2.

296
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:38,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I like this.

297
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Insert usual love the show drivel here.

298
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:42,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

299
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:48,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Boom Boom Rocket, I don't know much about, but people that have gotten their hands on it say if you like music games, you're going to like yourself some Boom Boom Rocket.

300
00:21:49,495 --> 00:21:49,975
[SPEAKER_12]: There's that.

301
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:52,837
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know when that'll be out, though, knowing the release schedule.

302
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:53,617
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be summer.

303
00:21:53,637 --> 00:21:54,798
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be the end of the year.

304
00:21:55,638 --> 00:21:58,760
[SPEAKER_12]: DDR on the 360 is actually, it's not that bad.

305
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,081
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just components of it are bad.

306
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:05,923
[SPEAKER_12]: But the game itself, the main core element of the game, I mean, what's DDR?

307
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:06,964
[SPEAKER_12]: It's songs and steps.

308
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,125
[SPEAKER_12]: The songs are great, and the steps are great.

309
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:10,466
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's it.

310
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:11,546
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a fine game.

311
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:16,629
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just all the other stuff around it, like quest mode, sucks, and some of the other stuff is not so hot.

312
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:18,470
[SPEAKER_12]: But the game itself is fine.

313
00:22:19,611 --> 00:22:21,392
[SPEAKER_12]: It depends how much do you love DDR.

314
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:23,133
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, are you willing to spend 80 bucks on it?

315
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:24,054
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the question.

316
00:22:24,434 --> 00:22:27,356
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's some good songs, and they'll keep you in shape and all that good stuff.

317
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:35,322
[SPEAKER_05]: And our last email of the day is from AZHP.

318
00:22:36,663 --> 00:22:39,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, just had a comment, possibly a very long comment.

319
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I miss some?

320
00:22:41,946 --> 00:22:45,449
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, LankyStyle was here and leaving, and I was trying to kiss him on his bald head.

321
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:45,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

322
00:22:47,408 --> 00:23:00,672
[SPEAKER_05]: On the email you guys got last week on the topic of piracy affecting game development, first of all, I'd like to say that the fact that Nintendo puts out arguably higher quality games than Sony and Microsoft is that they simply care more about the fun factor in the games than any other developer out there.

323
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:12,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Shigeru Miyamoto said in his GDC keynote that if at any point during the development he feels they have lost sight of the fact that this game is supposed to make people happy, he scraps it and redoes it from the ground up.

324
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:13,037
[SPEAKER_05]: That's devotion.

325
00:23:13,997 --> 00:23:14,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Secondly,

326
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:17,271
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

327
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:39,447
[SPEAKER_05]: This is purely marketing and financial-based decision and is probably not affected at all by the piracy issue.

328
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:41,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo is not like other companies in this regard.

329
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:49,192
[SPEAKER_05]: They spend as much time as they want or need pushing back release dates if necessary to ensure the highest quality games, not the highest quantity.

330
00:23:50,193 --> 00:23:52,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, Nintendo's consoles are not much harder to pirate.

331
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:57,640
[SPEAKER_05]: are not any harder to pirate games on than the PS2 or Xbox.

332
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:06,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a mod ship in my GameCube and I burn my original discs to many DVD-Rs so that I don't have to lug around giant DVD cases that GameCube games come in as I travel a lot.

333
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:11,411
[SPEAKER_05]: There are also mods that allow you to use full-size DVDs for your games.

334
00:24:12,012 --> 00:24:16,896
[SPEAKER_05]: So the argument that Nintendo games are harder to pirate as a reason that Nintendo is succeeding is not valid.

335
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:17,792
[SPEAKER_05]: A-freaking-men.

336
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:48,692
[SPEAKER_12]: I would agree that piracy is something really that not the masses really gets in on.

337
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:55,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, very few people would know how to put DDR fifth mix on a PSP, Loki.

338
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:58,272
[SPEAKER_12]: or would know how to do some of that stuff.

339
00:24:58,592 --> 00:25:01,614
[SPEAKER_12]: They would know how to pirate or mod a GameCube and all that stuff.

340
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:02,876
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not an easy thing to do.

341
00:25:03,316 --> 00:25:04,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Your average person is not going to be able to do it.

342
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:12,724
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of think about when piracy got really busted and got out of control and I think about Napster and when did Napster really cross the line?

343
00:25:13,185 --> 00:25:19,931
[SPEAKER_12]: When like every media outlet started reporting on it and then every college kid in the nation was using Napster to download music off each other.

344
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:24,812
[SPEAKER_12]: and to some extent, yeah, the piracy still goes on today, but it's not as easy as it used to be, right?

345
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:30,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, remember it used to be like you just download Napster, type in Metallica and bam, you get like any song you wanted, right?

346
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:39,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, now you have to download LimeWire and type in Metallica and then you can... And hopefully you connect to the server and you have to configure, and the thing isn't as user-friendly and you have to configure all that stuff.

347
00:25:40,296 --> 00:25:41,676
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not as easy as it was.

348
00:25:41,696 --> 00:25:45,897
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all about BitTorrent and use groups or Usenet.

349
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:49,638
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying just because it's not easy makes it right, but I'm just, you know, that

350
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:58,848
[SPEAKER_12]: That is true that, you know, you're probably never going to eliminate piracy completely, but you can make it difficult enough where that most people aren't going to figure out how to do it or care.

351
00:25:59,308 --> 00:25:59,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?

352
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:00,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

353
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:03,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, you're just an exception.

354
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:04,350
[SPEAKER_12]: You're a special child.

355
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:04,790
[SPEAKER_12]: Face it.

356
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give him some donuts.

357
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,991
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

358
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:09,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it for the mailbag?

359
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:10,911
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be it.

360
00:26:10,931 --> 00:26:11,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Einhander is awesome.

361
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:13,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Send more email.

362
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:14,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag at Orange Lodge.

363
00:26:14,732 --> 00:26:16,233
[SPEAKER_12]: You have Einhander on your PSP?

364
00:26:16,573 --> 00:26:16,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

365
00:26:16,953 --> 00:26:17,673
[SPEAKER_12]: God damn you.

366
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:25,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag, OrangeLaunchRadio.com Well, this is something else we can get mad about because we didn't have this.

367
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:29,427
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of old news because it's ending like now.

368
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:34,910
[SPEAKER_12]: But Australia actually had a free Xbox Live Gold service all weekend long.

369
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,391
[SPEAKER_12]: That ran this weekend, March 9th through March 11th.

370
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:43,754
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're an Xbox Live Silver subscriber in Australia, you got three days worth of gold.

371
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:45,295
[SPEAKER_12]: So pretty cool there.

372
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:48,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Discovery Channel gave the Gears of War maps.

373
00:26:48,163 --> 00:26:49,284
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't Discovery Channel.

374
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:49,964
[SPEAKER_12]: It was somebody else.

375
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,244
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

376
00:27:11,102 --> 00:27:14,364
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was some type of network or TV show or something.

377
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:15,904
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure somebody in chat room remembers.

378
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:16,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows?

379
00:27:18,545 --> 00:27:19,106
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to see.

380
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:19,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe not.

381
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:22,287
[SPEAKER_12]: History Channel?

382
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:24,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Dark Knight says it was the History... No, I don't think it was the History Channel.

383
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:27,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it?

384
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:28,030
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

385
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Alrighty.

386
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:35,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, so people love free Xbox Live Gold Weekends.

387
00:27:35,673 --> 00:27:37,614
[SPEAKER_09]: People don't like Bullet Witch.

388
00:27:38,634 --> 00:27:39,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bullet Witch...

389
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:42,502
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

390
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:12,829
[SPEAKER_09]: No lock-on, cheap deaths, horrendous voice acting, cumbersome systems for casting spells, which I might agree that is pretty bad, camera angle too low to the ground, and invisible and visible barriers all over the place.

391
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:15,910
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it just sounds to me... It's a giant brain.

392
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,170
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sloppy stuff.

393
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:25,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a giant brain's kind of cool, you know, because that's just an enemy that you fight, and the fact that it's a giant brain makes it easier to hit with their crappy targeting system.

394
00:28:26,112 --> 00:28:27,392
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

395
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:28,612
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

396
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:28,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

397
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:34,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was one of those games, though, that probably shouldn't have been brought over here for, you know, the full price.

398
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:40,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, well, it was $49.99, so maybe $39.99 would have been a better price.

399
00:28:41,318 --> 00:28:43,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, like, they have to pay us to play it.

400
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, maybe free would have been a better price.

401
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:48,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

402
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:51,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, at least it wasn't as bad as Bomberman Act Zero.

403
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:53,185
[SPEAKER_09]: That is one thing.

404
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:55,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, great, they could put that on the sticker, a little sticker, so, you know,

405
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:59,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki from Horizons Radio says, hey, it wasn't as bad as Bomberman Act Zero.

406
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:05,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have something that should make everybody happy in regards to Xbox Live.

407
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:12,217
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game going to Xbox Live.

408
00:29:13,037 --> 00:29:23,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be actually out, I believe the date was March 21st, which is right before the movie comes out on March 23rd, guys.

409
00:29:23,682 --> 00:29:24,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't that speculation still?

410
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:25,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Because...

411
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:26,590
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

412
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:02,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, also, you can still play it alone, and it's like co-op if you want it, I guess.

413
00:30:03,226 --> 00:30:03,966
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's still Turtles.

414
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Dibs on Leonardo.

415
00:30:06,368 --> 00:30:07,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Dibs on Donatello for me.

416
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:09,590
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

417
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:17,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know, I want to address this real quick before we get into our next segment, but I noticed this coming up quite a bit in our chat.

418
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,297
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen this like twice now tonight, and it's coming up again.

419
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:23,588
[SPEAKER_12]: and the person who's posting it has an OL Army recruit number in front of him, so I can't credit it.

420
00:30:23,908 --> 00:30:30,569
[SPEAKER_12]: But somebody is spreading around this story about Mushroom Kingdom Hearts coming to the Nintendo Wii.

421
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:32,449
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got to be fake, right?

422
00:30:32,469 --> 00:30:33,970
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an April Fool's joke.

423
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,070
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it is.

424
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:38,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Every year they do an April Fool's joke and it's April Fool's joke.

425
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:39,191
[SPEAKER_12]: God, I hate April Fool's Day.

426
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:40,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I see.

427
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:44,772
[SPEAKER_12]: So the upcoming April issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly and they always do some stupid-ass April Fool's thing.

428
00:30:45,252 --> 00:30:45,972
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I get it.

429
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:48,201
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gotta be a joke, come on.

430
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:48,902
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a joke.

431
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:49,502
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a joke.

432
00:30:49,522 --> 00:30:51,082
[SPEAKER_09]: They even pointed it out that it's a joke.

433
00:30:51,402 --> 00:30:52,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, alright.

434
00:30:53,723 --> 00:30:57,744
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a nice idea, but I don't... I would like a new Mario RPG.

435
00:30:58,324 --> 00:30:58,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

436
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:02,105
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's never... It's a great idea.

437
00:31:02,145 --> 00:31:05,946
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's why it makes a pretty decent joke, but no, sorry guys, it's not a reality.

438
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:06,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

439
00:31:08,006 --> 00:31:15,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, since Jamie brought up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles being confirmed for Xbox Live Arcade and all, we thought we'd take this opportunity...

440
00:31:16,395 --> 00:31:16,636
[SPEAKER_12]: LISTLESS

441
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:49,577
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's been brought to my attention by a long-time listener and staff of the show, Dark Datsuya, that we may have actually done this topic once before, but we've deemed since it's been at least a year since we've done this topic, and so much has changed, and we have a lot of new listeners since the last time, we're going to go ahead and do a list list for this topic tonight.

442
00:31:49,897 --> 00:31:59,162
[SPEAKER_12]: And the list list would be, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was one of the most sought-after games for the Xbox Live marketplace, right?

443
00:31:59,182 --> 00:31:59,222
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

444
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:05,238
[SPEAKER_12]: What arcade game now do people want to see on Xbox Live Arcade?

445
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that Ninja Turtles has made its way over, what game should be next?

446
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,060
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is the way Listless works.

447
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Each of the three hosts and our special guest who's joining us for this segment, Miklatov.

448
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:18,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we give Miklatov a mic so we can say hello to him?

449
00:32:19,863 --> 00:32:21,443
[SPEAKER_08]: No, good job dropping the mic.

450
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:22,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

451
00:32:22,443 --> 00:32:22,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Miklatov.

452
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:23,344
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you?

453
00:32:23,564 --> 00:32:23,884
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm good.

454
00:32:24,104 --> 00:32:24,324
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

455
00:32:24,744 --> 00:32:26,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Miklatov's going to help us build a list.

456
00:32:26,965 --> 00:32:30,446
[SPEAKER_12]: So each of us are going to give our top three so we get a list of 12 games.

457
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:37,237
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we're each going to go around and knock one thing off the list, leaving a list of eight games.

458
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:49,540
[SPEAKER_12]: After that, the chat room will vote on their favorites, and we will get the definitive top one, two, and three list of the arcade games you would like to see ported over to Xbox Live Arcade.

459
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,961
[SPEAKER_12]: So, let's start it off.

460
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,241
[SPEAKER_12]: Who wants to start off tonight?

461
00:32:53,234 --> 00:32:53,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I shall.

462
00:32:53,835 --> 00:32:55,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, ladies first.

463
00:32:55,376 --> 00:33:00,481
[SPEAKER_12]: What would be your pick for the game you would most like to see on Xbox Live Marketplace?

464
00:33:00,581 --> 00:33:01,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Arcade games, folks.

465
00:33:01,441 --> 00:33:02,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Number three, right?

466
00:33:02,402 --> 00:33:02,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Number three.

467
00:33:03,303 --> 00:33:03,643
[SPEAKER_03]: R-Type.

468
00:33:04,644 --> 00:33:05,245
[SPEAKER_12]: R-Type!

469
00:33:05,345 --> 00:33:06,146
[SPEAKER_03]: The arcade R-Type.

470
00:33:06,606 --> 00:33:07,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Why arcade R-Type?

471
00:33:07,747 --> 00:33:08,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's fucking R-Type!

472
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:13,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, Loki, what would be your number three pick?

473
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:17,616
[SPEAKER_09]: The arcade version of Bionic Commando.

474
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:20,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, that's kind of obscure.

475
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:24,269
[SPEAKER_12]: How is the arcade version of Bionic Commando different from the NES, for those who don't know?

476
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:25,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully not by much.

477
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:26,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

478
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:27,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Better graphics.

479
00:33:28,894 --> 00:33:35,742
[SPEAKER_12]: I can just tell you, like, I haven't played Bionic Commando in the arcade, but I can tell you that, like, Rygar in the arcade and on the NES were completely frickin' different.

480
00:33:36,603 --> 00:33:38,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, Mikotaba, why don't you go next?

481
00:33:38,065 --> 00:33:39,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Your number three pick.

482
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:43,672
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say the X-Men game.

483
00:33:44,132 --> 00:33:45,573
[SPEAKER_08]: The big screen one.

484
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:46,413
[SPEAKER_04]: The six person?

485
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:47,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was a good game.

486
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:50,156
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about that last week here on the show, the X-Men game.

487
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,357
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a very good choice.

488
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:52,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, X-Men.

489
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:56,420
[SPEAKER_12]: My number three pick would be Quiz and Dragons.

490
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,882
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can take on Bobby Blackwolf through Xbox Live.

491
00:33:59,982 --> 00:34:06,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Quiz and Dragons was this game and it had like, I think they used pretty much the same engine that Magic Sword and all those other games used.

492
00:34:06,307 --> 00:34:06,947
[SPEAKER_08]: What's Magic Sword?

493
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:08,168
[SPEAKER_12]: God, okay, um

494
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,781
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura Planet Harrier Space Harrier

495
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Which was a really freaking awesome game.

496
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:41,422
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've played Planet Harrier in the arcade.

497
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:42,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really fun.

498
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:46,087
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that it deserves some sort of home release.

499
00:34:46,707 --> 00:34:48,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

500
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:49,189
[SPEAKER_12]: What next?

501
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:53,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, what would be your number two pick?

502
00:34:53,393 --> 00:35:03,342
[SPEAKER_09]: My number two pick would be... You know, actually, I would like to see... I see the image of the game.

503
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:09,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to have to go with, you know, the Beyonce Metal Slug, actually.

504
00:35:10,323 --> 00:35:12,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, why the hell not?

505
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're going to put Metal Slug in everything.

506
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:17,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd rather have some achievements for it.

507
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:19,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Metal Slug.

508
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:23,488
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't believe you of all people just said that you need more Metal Slug.

509
00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:24,829
[SPEAKER_12]: You obviously are drawing a blank.

510
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:29,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, Miklatov, you're number two.

511
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:31,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Turtles in Time.

512
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:33,914
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's the superior one.

513
00:35:34,014 --> 00:35:35,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Turtles in Time, the sequel.

514
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:35,815
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

515
00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:36,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds fair.

516
00:35:36,455 --> 00:35:38,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Turtles in Time.

517
00:35:38,376 --> 00:35:42,017
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so much fun to, like, throw the foot soldiers at the screen.

518
00:35:42,037 --> 00:35:43,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the one you do it in.

519
00:35:43,298 --> 00:35:44,398
[SPEAKER_08]: And, like, it was like Battletoads.

520
00:35:44,419 --> 00:35:45,719
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do it in the first one, too.

521
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:46,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

522
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:57,624
[SPEAKER_12]: I was originally... This is a case where the chat room yelling out random things can have influence on us because I'm actually going to pick one from chat for my number two because I originally was going to say Rampart because that game was pretty awesome.

523
00:35:57,644 --> 00:35:58,225
[SPEAKER_12]: What's Rampart?

524
00:35:58,285 --> 00:35:58,365
[SPEAKER_12]: We...

525
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:01,263
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't ever play arcade games, do you?

526
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:02,063
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm young.

527
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:06,746
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of Tetris-y because you would rotate pieces to build a wall.

528
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,166
[SPEAKER_12]: But they have it on PlayStation 3.

529
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:09,487
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see why they can't have it.

530
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:10,988
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll take it off since it's on PlayStation 3.

531
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:17,131
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to say, I love this idea, NBA Jam totally needs to be on Xbox Live.

532
00:36:17,151 --> 00:36:20,172
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to have the codes, though, for the Mortal Kombat characters.

533
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:21,333
[SPEAKER_05]: That game was so good.

534
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:26,015
[SPEAKER_12]: That could totally work, too, because Midway puts a bunch of stuff on Mario Kart.

535
00:36:26,075 --> 00:36:27,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I want NBA Jam.

536
00:36:27,116 --> 00:36:27,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck yeah.

537
00:36:28,243 --> 00:36:29,303
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm putting NBA Jam down.

538
00:36:29,343 --> 00:36:30,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Actdeft.

539
00:36:31,724 --> 00:36:33,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Number one pick, DarkSakura.

540
00:36:34,064 --> 00:36:34,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Radiant Silvergun.

541
00:36:35,564 --> 00:36:36,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, good pick.

542
00:36:36,245 --> 00:36:37,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Radiant Silvergun.

543
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:39,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's freaking treasure.

544
00:36:39,345 --> 00:36:40,165
[SPEAKER_05]: It's treasure.

545
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:46,466
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, I do agree with GS68 for Blazing Star, but no.

546
00:36:47,447 --> 00:36:49,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be Radiant Silvergun.

547
00:36:50,387 --> 00:36:51,687
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

548
00:36:52,028 --> 00:36:53,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, your number one pick.

549
00:36:54,048 --> 00:36:54,368
[SPEAKER_09]: You know...

550
00:36:54,949 --> 00:37:01,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a couple things, and I just thought of my second pick, but I can't remember what the game's called, so whatever.

551
00:37:02,392 --> 00:37:04,612
[SPEAKER_09]: So my number one pick's going to be Simpsons, the arcade game.

552
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:06,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good pick, good pick.

553
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:12,575
[SPEAKER_09]: My number two, instead of Metal Slug, should have been, and I can't remember, those hentai puzzle games I kept playing.

554
00:37:12,595 --> 00:37:15,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Because those are fun.

555
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:17,057
[SPEAKER_12]: The hentai kicks thing.

556
00:37:17,137 --> 00:37:19,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember what it was called, though.

557
00:37:19,098 --> 00:37:20,598
[SPEAKER_12]: You should have just said Gal's Panic.

558
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:22,539
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it was, Gal's Panic.

559
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:27,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Will we allow Loki to remove Metal Slug and put in Gal's Panic?

560
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:28,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

561
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:29,646
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, fine.

562
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:33,368
[SPEAKER_12]: We will allow Metal Slug to come off the list in favor of Gal's Panic.

563
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:34,549
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

564
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:35,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Gal's Panic.

565
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,131
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the first time we've ever done that on a listless segment, by the way.

566
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:40,352
[SPEAKER_12]: Allowed that to get changed.

567
00:37:40,412 --> 00:37:40,712
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

568
00:37:41,653 --> 00:37:44,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Mikotov, you looked a little pissed off when Loki took Simpsons, the arcade game.

569
00:37:44,734 --> 00:37:46,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you come up with a new number one?

570
00:37:46,277 --> 00:37:50,798
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying so hard, but that's all the arcade games I played.

571
00:37:51,158 --> 00:37:53,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Shall we go to the chat rooms for some ideas?

572
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:54,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me look at them.

573
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:56,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you like me to read some to you?

574
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,261
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't credit all these because a lot of folks are just yelling them out.

575
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:07,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Super Offroad, Moonwalker Arcade, Dungeons & Dragons, Shadows Over Mysteria.

576
00:38:10,684 --> 00:38:11,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I pick a ticket game?

577
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,745
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you can't do a ticket game.

578
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:17,304
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there was this... Crazy Climber.

579
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,264
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there was this game that everybody played.

580
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:22,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Street Fighter 2 without getting fucked up.

581
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:28,467
[SPEAKER_08]: It was by Midway, and it had like a joystick and a trackball, and it was like a third-person shooter type game.

582
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:29,367
[SPEAKER_12]: The Grid.

583
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:30,187
[SPEAKER_08]: The Grid, yeah.

584
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:30,847
[SPEAKER_12]: You want The Grid?

585
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:31,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I want The Grid.

586
00:38:31,748 --> 00:38:32,488
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, The Grid.

587
00:38:32,508 --> 00:38:33,788
[SPEAKER_12]: We just talked about that earlier in the show.

588
00:38:33,828 --> 00:38:34,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Where were you?

589
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:36,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was drooling over a guy at Starbucks.

590
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:38,669
[SPEAKER_08]: My fault.

591
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,150
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, yeah, yeah.

592
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Shane comes back in here and goes, you guys want anything from Starbucks?

593
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:44,391
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, they're going backwards.

594
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:52,407
[SPEAKER_12]: My number one pick would be Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, because that game was awesome!

595
00:38:53,288 --> 00:38:55,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially with Dance Puzzle Jojo.

596
00:38:55,449 --> 00:38:56,069
[SPEAKER_12]: And why not?

597
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:59,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they have Street Fighter 2 up, why not give us Puzzle Fighter 2?

598
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably because the joystick sucks?

599
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:08,715
[SPEAKER_12]: That's funny, because Actdeft said that again in chat, but I actually had that written down before he said that.

600
00:39:09,035 --> 00:39:11,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft and I are on very similar wavelengths tonight, apparently.

601
00:39:11,994 --> 00:39:12,574
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you have it.

602
00:39:12,614 --> 00:39:18,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the list as it stands so far before the elimination part of this list.

603
00:39:18,876 --> 00:39:36,702
[SPEAKER_12]: We have Arcade R-Type, Bionic Commando, X-Men, Quiz and Dragons, Planet Harrier, Gauss Panic, Turtles in Time, NBA Jam, Radiant Silvergun, Simpsons, The Grid, and Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.

604
00:39:37,122 --> 00:39:39,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Which of these games is not worthy of being on the list?

605
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,323
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.

606
00:39:44,406 --> 00:39:44,746
[SPEAKER_04]: The Grid.

607
00:39:46,147 --> 00:39:47,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, The Grid gets denied.

608
00:39:47,828 --> 00:39:49,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not very fond of that game.

609
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:53,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Nikolatov says, you know what, I pulled that out of my ass anyway, so I'm okay with that elimination.

610
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:56,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, which of these games does not deserve to be on the list?

611
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:01,316
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I would actually say...

612
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:08,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, NBA Jam, just because there's no way they would be able to... I mean, it would be nice, but they can't do it!

613
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Blame EA!

614
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:13,163
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the rights to the NBA franchise for years and years and years.

615
00:40:13,564 --> 00:40:16,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, no, they do it to... No, that's the NFL, not the NBA, right?

616
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:17,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're right, you're right.

617
00:40:18,187 --> 00:40:18,748
[SPEAKER_09]: My mistake.

618
00:40:18,928 --> 00:40:20,689
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it should stay!

619
00:40:20,729 --> 00:40:21,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, fine, it'll stay.

620
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo!

621
00:40:23,252 --> 00:40:27,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Radiant Silvergun, because there's going to be already Ikaruga and a bunch of other shit coming to LiveRK.

622
00:40:27,435 --> 00:40:29,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Radiant Silvergun is unique!

623
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:30,850
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gone.

624
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:32,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

625
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:33,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Any more, please?

626
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:35,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

627
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:36,693
[SPEAKER_05]: No donut for you.

628
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye-bye, Radiant Silvergun.

629
00:40:38,214 --> 00:40:39,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice knowing you.

630
00:40:39,115 --> 00:40:39,455
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

631
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:42,957
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's funny because chat room was like, fuck you, Loki, fuck you, Loki.

632
00:40:42,997 --> 00:40:44,578
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I retract that, fuck you.

633
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:47,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Miklatov, which of these comes off the list?

634
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

635
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Miklatov, which one of these does not deserve to be on the list?

636
00:40:53,022 --> 00:40:55,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Quiz and Dragons because it's too nerdy for that list.

637
00:40:56,905 --> 00:40:57,445
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of...

638
00:40:57,975 --> 00:41:02,797
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of accepted the fact that Quiz and Dragons would come off the list, so I'm okay with that.

639
00:41:04,438 --> 00:41:09,601
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will help Jamie out and take a little revenge on Loki, but not how you think.

640
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:12,022
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to take off Bionic Commando, because come on.

641
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:15,083
[SPEAKER_12]: He couldn't even tell me what was different from the NES version.

642
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:17,324
[SPEAKER_09]: It had better graphics, that's it.

643
00:41:17,484 --> 00:41:19,465
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the NES version is awesome.

644
00:41:19,525 --> 00:41:22,187
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, what's the difference between Contra and Contra in the arcade?

645
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:23,547
[SPEAKER_12]: It has better graphics, that's it.

646
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:25,068
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the only one you need.

647
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:26,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Arcade R-Type X-Men

648
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:51,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Planet Harrier, Gal's Panic, Turtles in Time, NBA Jam, Simpsons, or Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.

649
00:41:51,983 --> 00:42:00,125
[SPEAKER_12]: The way this works is you're going to send your number one and your number two pick in a private message to Sky in our chat room, only if you're listening live.

650
00:42:00,165 --> 00:42:03,726
[SPEAKER_12]: You send your number one and your number two pick clearly labeled.

651
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,646
[SPEAKER_12]: That helps us break any ties.

652
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:06,687
[SPEAKER_12]: So there it is.

653
00:42:07,847 --> 00:42:12,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Arcade R-Type, X-Man, Planet Harrier, Gal's Panic, Turtles in Time, NBA Jam, Simpsons,

654
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:16,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, what arcade game should they port next to Xbox Live Arcade?

655
00:42:16,437 --> 00:42:17,717
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have the results later in the show.

656
00:42:17,798 --> 00:42:23,360
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good thing you said the X-Men game because the other game I would have mentioned was the Avengers game.

657
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:31,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the Avengers game, I've been, like everybody knows I've been getting back into my whole obsession with Captain America and I love the Avengers.

658
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:34,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been like actually downloading them.

659
00:42:35,406 --> 00:42:38,247
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually played that the other day, the old game.

660
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:45,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, I don't think they would put Gals Panic on Live Arcade because it's too pornographic for them.

661
00:42:46,154 --> 00:42:47,275
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fun game, though.

662
00:42:47,475 --> 00:42:49,117
[SPEAKER_05]: They could do Girls of Xbox.

663
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:55,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they have the one that's not Gals Panic, but it's like Gals Panic, but in 3D.

664
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:59,784
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not nudity, but it's just scantily clad animation.

665
00:42:59,964 --> 00:43:00,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Bra and Panties.

666
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:01,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

667
00:43:01,725 --> 00:43:02,686
[SPEAKER_09]: The Bra and Panties game.

668
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:04,787
[SPEAKER_09]: You should have just called it that.

669
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:08,330
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can have Dead or Alive, Extreme Beach, Volleyball, whatever, then you can have that.

670
00:43:08,996 --> 00:43:11,357
[SPEAKER_12]: I have an engagement somewhere else.

671
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:12,198
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tell you offline.

672
00:43:33,575 --> 00:43:35,836
[SPEAKER_12]: because you're more than invited, which I told you about before.

673
00:43:35,856 --> 00:43:37,176
[SPEAKER_12]: OLR Extreme Beach Volleyball.

674
00:43:37,256 --> 00:43:39,196
[SPEAKER_12]: OLR Extreme Beach Volleyball, I think not.

675
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:41,037
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to see me in a Speedo, you need help.

676
00:43:41,057 --> 00:43:42,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I played volleyball in high school.

677
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:43,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you?

678
00:43:43,598 --> 00:43:44,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.

679
00:43:44,898 --> 00:43:50,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't know why they always make me the server because I was short and I couldn't spike.

680
00:43:50,899 --> 00:43:53,160
[SPEAKER_12]: You played volleyball in high school, Shane?

681
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

682
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,461
[SPEAKER_12]: But was it sunny enough in Kansas to actually play volleyball?

683
00:43:57,861 --> 00:43:58,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it was indoor volleyball.

684
00:44:00,422 --> 00:44:00,662
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

685
00:44:01,249 --> 00:44:02,910
[SPEAKER_12]: I played Marching Band.

686
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:03,971
[SPEAKER_12]: That was my sport.

687
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:04,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in Marching Band, too.

688
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:05,571
[SPEAKER_12]: And your book.

689
00:44:06,452 --> 00:44:10,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Something else I played a lot of in high school that I haven't played a lot of since is Earthworm Jim.

690
00:44:10,954 --> 00:44:11,615
[SPEAKER_12]: And guess what?

691
00:44:12,095 --> 00:44:20,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Dave Perry, the shiny entertainment founder, has hinted that a new Earthworm Jim game is going to, quote, happen eventually.

692
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:23,361
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, they have put together the pieces of the development team...

693
00:44:24,149 --> 00:44:26,872
[SPEAKER_12]: to revive this game that originally came out in 1994.

694
00:44:27,692 --> 00:44:30,315
[SPEAKER_12]: You might remember it was the game where you could launch cows.

695
00:44:30,615 --> 00:44:32,016
[SPEAKER_12]: And I remember the burping theme song.

696
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,317
[SPEAKER_12]: It went, Earthworm Jim.

697
00:44:33,497 --> 00:44:36,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Like somebody burped the title and they recorded it.

698
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's how mature Earthworm Jim was of a game.

699
00:44:39,402 --> 00:44:41,144
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it would be kind of fun to see that come back.

700
00:44:41,224 --> 00:44:43,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do I have a feeling this might be an Xbox Live Arcade title?

701
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:46,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Does it scream Xbox Live to anyone else?

702
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:47,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it just me?

703
00:44:47,749 --> 00:44:48,830
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

704
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:50,251
[SPEAKER_12]: It does.

705
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:51,012
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

706
00:44:52,344 --> 00:44:58,628
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, they did, didn't they do like a 3D remake of it or something like that that came out on the PSP or something?

707
00:44:58,668 --> 00:45:00,669
[SPEAKER_09]: You're thinking of Bubsy, I think.

708
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:02,670
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, I'm thinking Earthworm Jim.

709
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

710
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:03,651
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

711
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:06,632
[SPEAKER_09]: There was like a quasi 3D remake or something.

712
00:45:06,652 --> 00:45:10,735
[SPEAKER_12]: No, somebody, I just, yeah, ew, 3D Earthworm Jim, the new Earthworm Jim better be 2D.

713
00:45:11,115 --> 00:45:12,816
[SPEAKER_12]: So apparently there was one, I just never played it.

714
00:45:12,896 --> 00:45:13,836
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess that's a good thing.

715
00:45:14,637 --> 00:45:19,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, so, um, well, Earthworm Jim, you know, it's a great game.

716
00:45:20,922 --> 00:45:24,145
[SPEAKER_09]: The question is, how do you get your girlfriend to play games with you?

717
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:27,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of which, you have excellent timing.

718
00:45:27,668 --> 00:45:29,790
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a list that's been posted on the internet.

719
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,051
[SPEAKER_09]: How to get your girlfriend to play video games with you.

720
00:45:33,613 --> 00:45:35,614
[SPEAKER_06]: You put lots of naked people in it.

721
00:45:36,335 --> 00:45:39,878
[SPEAKER_06]: You put things that she likes in it and not things you like in it.

722
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:40,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

723
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:44,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one, they say find out if your girlfriend has ever played video games.

724
00:45:44,482 --> 00:45:49,126
[SPEAKER_09]: She may not be a full-blown gamer, but she may have played Mario games when she was younger.

725
00:45:49,881 --> 00:46:14,817
[SPEAKER_09]: and she may play games on the internet and stuff like that to remind your girlfriend that if you both play games you'll be able to spend even more quality time together bullshit pick out games she might like if you're not 100% sure she'll enjoy it you can rent it try to choose a game or system that isn't too confusing and doesn't require short reaction time because girls are feeble minded apparently

726
00:46:15,467 --> 00:46:16,668
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was just thinking.

727
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:20,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, because my female brain can't figure out these buttons.

728
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,212
[SPEAKER_12]: The voice you're hearing, by the way, is Loki's wife, Nellie.

729
00:46:23,352 --> 00:46:23,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

730
00:46:24,012 --> 00:46:24,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Nellie.

731
00:46:24,773 --> 00:46:25,133
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

732
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:27,214
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm retarded because I can't figure out buttons.

733
00:46:27,274 --> 00:46:28,535
[SPEAKER_06]: What do I do with this?

734
00:46:28,695 --> 00:46:29,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

735
00:46:30,556 --> 00:46:32,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Where does the thingy go?

736
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:36,500
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can, get a game that is multiplayer, optimally co-op.

737
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And it says, consider your girlfriend's personality when picking out a game.

738
00:46:39,962 --> 00:46:43,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Some girls may prefer brightly colored, all-ages games like Katamari...

739
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:48,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Bustamove, Lego, Star Wars, Sims, or any Mario game.

740
00:46:48,316 --> 00:46:56,079
[SPEAKER_09]: But remember, if your girlfriend is an individual who could just as well go for Halo, Resident Evil, Grand Theft Auto, or Nelly's case, Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball 2.

741
00:46:56,959 --> 00:47:02,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get games that involve things like strippers, prostitutes, sex, unless she has a sense of humor about the subject.

742
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:07,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, it's a good thing that they added the sense of humor thing, but I was about to disagree.

743
00:47:08,677 --> 00:47:10,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun when you play with her.

744
00:47:10,799 --> 00:47:12,741
[SPEAKER_09]: If you make a good time, she'll enjoy it.

745
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:16,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if she's not into games and yadda yadda yadda.

746
00:47:17,325 --> 00:47:20,148
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, I don't know.

747
00:47:20,768 --> 00:47:22,149
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have a whole bunch of tips out there.

748
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:23,591
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on wikihow.com.

749
00:47:23,631 --> 00:47:27,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Get your girlfriend to play video games if you're really interested.

750
00:47:29,075 --> 00:47:33,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I just say, like Nellie said, make sure that there's porn in there or something.

751
00:47:34,861 --> 00:47:35,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Incentives.

752
00:47:36,209 --> 00:47:38,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Get Rez with the Transvibrator.

753
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:39,090
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

754
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:40,371
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

755
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:46,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, every week on this program, DarkSakura likes to surf the Internet up and down and left and right and back and forth.

756
00:47:46,513 --> 00:47:55,737
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever the DDR steps are that she's dancing to this week will be the World Wide Web Surfing to find the website of the week to share with you all here on Orange Lounge Radio.

757
00:47:55,777 --> 00:47:57,618
[SPEAKER_12]: So, DarkSakura, what is your website of the week?

758
00:47:58,658 --> 00:47:59,359
[SPEAKER_05]: You picked it out.

759
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:00,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I helped.

760
00:48:01,399 --> 00:48:02,260
[SPEAKER_12]: You asked for ideas.

761
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,040
[SPEAKER_12]: I gave you ideas.

762
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,281
[SPEAKER_05]: But it would have been one that I would have used.

763
00:48:05,866 --> 00:48:08,848
[SPEAKER_05]: It's PotterPuppetPals.com, which I think was down for a while.

764
00:48:09,508 --> 00:48:15,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, it's just the ones that came out in the actual puppet version.

765
00:48:15,932 --> 00:48:20,915
[SPEAKER_05]: With the sexy Snape animation and the muggle pants animation and stuff like that.

766
00:48:21,576 --> 00:48:22,376
[SPEAKER_05]: PotterPuppetPals.

767
00:48:22,396 --> 00:48:24,558
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Snape!

768
00:48:24,638 --> 00:48:25,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's bother him!

769
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:28,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Bother, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother!

770
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:31,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that just PotterPuppetPals.com?

771
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:32,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

772
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:33,103
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

773
00:48:33,598 --> 00:48:35,019
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

774
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:06,459
[SPEAKER_09]: as well as some episodic content, new modes and maps and whatnot.

775
00:49:07,299 --> 00:49:08,020
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

776
00:49:08,721 --> 00:49:23,614
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently on March 23rd, coinciding with the European launch, they're going to launch the two multiplayer modes, which is team conversion, basically the conversion mode with teams, and assault, where you destroy your team's defending base.

777
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:27,918
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're also adding a spectator camera mode as well,

778
00:49:29,235 --> 00:49:35,159
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, later on we should be getting some more story elements, um, in the form of episodic content.

779
00:49:35,299 --> 00:49:38,861
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm glad to see that they're actually doing some stuff with this game, because it is pretty awesome game.

780
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:44,084
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, you know, once you finish with it, I guess multiplayer is the only thing left for you.

781
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you can go back through the game and get some more weapons, but that's about it.

782
00:49:48,126 --> 00:49:48,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun, though.

783
00:49:50,668 --> 00:49:55,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Alrighty, well, we're going to open up our Skype line here very soon, so you guys can interact with our program.

784
00:49:55,851 --> 00:49:57,652
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a couple people calling in during part A.

785
00:49:58,268 --> 00:49:58,488
[SPEAKER_12]: 877-GAME-OLR

786
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,742
[SPEAKER_12]: Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.

787
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:28,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Number three was your number two pick.

788
00:50:28,883 --> 00:50:34,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Your number two pick was NBA Jam was the number two pick you would like to see.

789
00:50:35,048 --> 00:50:38,770
[SPEAKER_12]: And number one, honestly, this isn't much of a shock to me.

790
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,773
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it was based on the same hardware, lovable characters.

791
00:50:43,654 --> 00:50:47,916
[SPEAKER_12]: The Simpsons is the number one game you guys want to see on the Xbox Live market.

792
00:50:47,956 --> 00:50:48,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're still talking about that.

793
00:50:48,857 --> 00:50:49,818
[SPEAKER_09]: They might do that, too.

794
00:50:50,058 --> 00:50:50,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Yay.

795
00:50:50,618 --> 00:50:50,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

796
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:53,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because with the movie coming out and everything.

797
00:50:54,046 --> 00:50:54,566
[SPEAKER_12]: It might happen.

798
00:50:54,907 --> 00:50:57,748
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, I just want to point out, Turtles in Time, very, very close.

799
00:50:57,868 --> 00:50:59,529
[SPEAKER_12]: One vote away from making it onto the list.

800
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:02,411
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was another one you guys wanted to see.

801
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:05,713
[SPEAKER_12]: But every entry on the list at least got a little bit of love.

802
00:51:06,113 --> 00:51:07,314
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you have it.

803
00:51:07,454 --> 00:51:08,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Tonight's list list.

804
00:51:08,654 --> 00:51:10,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, chat room, for playing along.

805
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:18,600
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're listening to this on your iPod, your Zooms, your PSPs, whatever the case may be, and you want to play along next time, you've got to join us live for a taping.

806
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,922
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Sunday nights over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

807
00:51:22,617 --> 00:51:26,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Shall we open up the Skype line and take a look at what our callers have to say?

808
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's shall.

809
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's do it.

810
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

811
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:30,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

812
00:51:32,503 --> 00:51:33,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, we're back.

813
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:34,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Paradox Vincent.

814
00:51:35,145 --> 00:51:36,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Paradox Vincent.

815
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,006
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind, buddy?

816
00:51:39,127 --> 00:51:39,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Not much.

817
00:51:40,448 --> 00:51:44,791
[SPEAKER_14]: I just got another Beatmania game, 10th style.

818
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:47,713
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to shout out a quick review for it.

819
00:51:47,893 --> 00:51:48,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sure.

820
00:51:48,373 --> 00:51:49,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Beatmania 10th style.

821
00:51:49,554 --> 00:51:50,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, this is an import game, right?

822
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:56,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's an import game, so I have to use Swap Magic with it.

823
00:51:56,098 --> 00:52:01,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, tell us, or you have to own a Japanese PlayStation 2, like I actually own one.

824
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,302
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a lot of dust on it, but I have one.

825
00:52:05,484 --> 00:52:05,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

826
00:52:06,144 --> 00:52:07,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, tell us your review.

827
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:21,515
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, Be Many a Ten style, well, it has my favorite song list in it, and, uh, I heard a lot of complaints about it on, uh, just some of the various Bimani communities, but...

828
00:52:22,003 --> 00:52:23,624
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't really see it.

829
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:25,685
[SPEAKER_14]: What were some of the complaints?

830
00:52:27,707 --> 00:52:28,187
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

831
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:30,748
[SPEAKER_14]: I just heard that it was bad.

832
00:52:31,729 --> 00:52:33,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Just people going, this sucks.

833
00:52:34,671 --> 00:52:36,572
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't ever take that for an answer, though.

834
00:52:36,592 --> 00:52:38,513
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't let somebody go, this sucks.

835
00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:39,093
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

836
00:52:39,153 --> 00:52:40,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Why does it suck?

837
00:52:42,616 --> 00:52:49,940
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing that I ever heard about that was legitimate was that it's where the difficulty really started ramping up.

838
00:52:51,028 --> 00:53:03,032
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a few songs in there where the difficulty just starts getting a little intense, but overall, I mean, I think it has the best song list out of the releases that I've played.

839
00:53:04,512 --> 00:53:07,093
[SPEAKER_12]: It does have a pretty solid song list, I remember that.

840
00:53:07,173 --> 00:53:10,674
[SPEAKER_12]: What types of songs would Bomani fans be happy to know are in the game?

841
00:53:13,034 --> 00:53:17,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there was Ixion by Leadlight, and there...

842
00:53:19,093 --> 00:53:20,714
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a lot of Sampling Masters.

843
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:22,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Sampling Masters was really heavy in there.

844
00:53:22,854 --> 00:53:25,195
[SPEAKER_14]: There was both Rattle the Mercury and Rattle the Sun.

845
00:53:27,456 --> 00:53:30,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Some Sampling Masters, ISF, 108, Daddy Daddy.

846
00:53:32,437 --> 00:53:34,698
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really... It was a talk heavy...

847
00:53:36,445 --> 00:53:37,686
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a lot of talk songs in there.

848
00:53:37,706 --> 00:53:41,148
[SPEAKER_14]: It depends, because I'm training somebody right now, and they seem to really like it and be able to play a lot of them.

849
00:53:41,168 --> 00:53:42,489
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you've never played before...

850
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:11,230
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd say maybe this one's just a little too hard, because after maybe the first five songs, the difficulty starts to ramp up a bit.

851
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:16,611
[SPEAKER_14]: So, maybe not TenStyle, but TenStyle would be an awesome second or third game.

852
00:54:17,211 --> 00:54:18,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well there you have it.

853
00:54:18,352 --> 00:54:20,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Any final thoughts for our listeners, ParadoxVincent?

854
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:29,334
[SPEAKER_14]: On a comment on the getting girls to play games segment, I just said,

855
00:54:31,511 --> 00:54:41,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, some of the games that I found worked really good were Katamari and DDR, actually, but no Rez.

856
00:54:42,973 --> 00:54:43,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Rez didn't work?

857
00:54:45,594 --> 00:54:46,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Rez doesn't work for anything.

858
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:47,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Even with the attachment?

859
00:54:49,054 --> 00:54:49,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh?

860
00:54:49,594 --> 00:54:51,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Even with the trans-fibrator attachment?

861
00:54:53,615 --> 00:54:56,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I don't know about the trans-fibrator attachment.

862
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:58,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe you need to have her take a second look.

863
00:55:00,613 --> 00:55:01,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

864
00:55:01,033 --> 00:55:01,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I will.

865
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:22,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess there's just a difference, though.

866
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:29,004
[SPEAKER_12]: I think when we read these stories about how do we get girls into gaming, they mean the casual gaming girl, I think.

867
00:55:29,124 --> 00:55:33,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Not the hardcore gamer nerds, you know, like you and I, regardless of sex and all that.

868
00:55:34,567 --> 00:55:34,867
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

869
00:55:35,588 --> 00:55:37,749
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's go back to the phone lines, take another call.

870
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:40,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

871
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:41,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

872
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:43,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, this is DMN.

873
00:55:43,893 --> 00:55:44,673
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, DMN.

874
00:55:44,693 --> 00:55:45,714
[SPEAKER_12]: God, you get through every week.

875
00:55:45,754 --> 00:55:46,254
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

876
00:55:47,215 --> 00:55:47,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

877
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:49,384
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

878
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Not so much as On Tour, which I really didn't like.

879
00:56:19,372 --> 00:56:20,032
[SPEAKER_07]: It's $50.

880
00:56:20,493 --> 00:56:21,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely recommend it.

881
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:25,016
[SPEAKER_12]: What if I've never played SSX before in my life?

882
00:56:25,296 --> 00:56:26,397
[SPEAKER_12]: What do I have to look forward to?

883
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:34,523
[SPEAKER_07]: If this is your first SSX game, it may be a little difficult for you.

884
00:56:35,303 --> 00:56:40,847
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing that's really difficult is... Excuse me.

885
00:56:41,516 --> 00:56:48,177
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing that's really difficult in that game is moving around and doing tricks, because they do it a lot differently than you would with a DualShock 2 controller.

886
00:56:49,818 --> 00:56:57,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you get accustomed to that, though, as the tutorial does a great job of having you get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun.

887
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,140
[SPEAKER_12]: When will SEX Tricky come out?

888
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,461
[SPEAKER_12]: An SEX blur.

889
00:57:03,641 --> 00:57:06,742
[SPEAKER_07]: When people don't give a shit about AO ratings.

890
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:08,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, fair enough.

891
00:57:09,853 --> 00:57:12,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything else that you've played this week you want to share with our listeners about?

892
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,620
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm getting back into a leap-eat agent, so I'm getting psyched for Owen Don, too.

893
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,101
[SPEAKER_07]: That's supposed to be coming out later this year.

894
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:20,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Looks pretty sexy.

895
00:57:20,162 --> 00:57:20,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember that.

896
00:57:20,762 --> 00:57:23,084
[SPEAKER_12]: That news just came out recently as well.

897
00:57:24,085 --> 00:57:28,769
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to ask you, you have not been the biggest Sony fan in the past, from what I remember.

898
00:57:28,809 --> 00:57:30,390
[SPEAKER_12]: What did you think about their announcements this week?

899
00:57:31,111 --> 00:57:32,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm excited for them.

900
00:57:33,012 --> 00:57:34,694
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation Home looks fantastic.

901
00:57:34,894 --> 00:57:37,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I could play the rip-off card, but I'm not going to.

902
00:57:39,187 --> 00:57:40,788
[SPEAKER_07]: LittleBigPlanet looks awesome.

903
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:50,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Not something that's going to make me drop $600 on a PS3, but it's a great idea, and I really hope it gets off the ground.

904
00:57:51,775 --> 00:57:52,075
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

905
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:54,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners, DMN?

906
00:57:55,937 --> 00:57:56,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

907
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:01,441
[SPEAKER_07]: We're introducing over the next month a new segment, a new recorded segment after SDFU.

908
00:58:01,501 --> 00:58:03,822
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the month of March, March Madness of Basketball.

909
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:08,685
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought I'd throw together a little tournament called DDR Madness.

910
00:58:09,704 --> 00:58:11,005
[SPEAKER_07]: 64 DDR and In The Groove songs.

911
00:58:11,305 --> 00:58:13,326
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys vote to determine which is the best one.

912
00:58:14,766 --> 00:58:17,407
[SPEAKER_12]: But if it's DDR madness, why do you have In The Groove songs in it?

913
00:58:17,447 --> 00:58:20,188
[SPEAKER_12]: Shouldn't it be like Dance Game Madness or something like that?

914
00:58:20,888 --> 00:58:21,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

915
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:22,449
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll call it Dance Game Madness.

916
00:58:22,489 --> 00:58:22,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

917
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:23,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

918
00:58:23,729 --> 00:58:24,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Yay.

919
00:58:24,189 --> 00:58:25,210
[SPEAKER_12]: I had an effect on the world.

920
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:26,130
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

921
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:29,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Listen to STFU Thursday night, 7 o'clock, right here on OLR.

922
00:58:29,391 --> 00:58:29,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes?

923
00:58:30,232 --> 00:58:30,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

924
00:58:30,832 --> 00:58:31,072
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

925
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:34,330
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's podcasted now, so you don't have an excuse not to listen.

926
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:35,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Sweet, is it really?

927
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,470
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we finally get that on our servers?

928
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:37,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we do.

929
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:39,731
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the pilot episode and episode 12 up right now.

930
00:58:39,991 --> 00:58:40,352
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

931
00:58:40,452 --> 00:58:42,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we going to get all the episodes on the stream?

932
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm going to release an old one and a new one every week.

933
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:46,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Sweet.

934
00:58:46,553 --> 00:58:48,394
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, check that out, Orange Launch Radio.

935
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:49,834
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the podcast feed?

936
00:58:50,094 --> 00:58:50,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it in iTunes yet?

937
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:56,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, stfu.orangelunchradio.com slash rss, I believe.

938
00:58:56,756 --> 00:58:58,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll find the link and post it in the chat.

939
00:58:59,042 --> 00:58:59,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

940
00:58:59,823 --> 00:59:02,905
[SPEAKER_12]: That will do us no good for the folks listening on the podcast right now.

941
00:59:03,766 --> 00:59:05,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Can they search it in iTunes or somewhere yet?

942
00:59:06,027 --> 00:59:07,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's up in iTunes now.

943
00:59:07,689 --> 00:59:07,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Sweet.

944
00:59:08,009 --> 00:59:08,850
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

945
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:09,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, good luck to you, DMN.

946
00:59:10,191 --> 00:59:10,431
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

947
00:59:10,471 --> 00:59:10,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, man.

948
00:59:10,951 --> 00:59:11,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

949
00:59:11,712 --> 00:59:11,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

950
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:12,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

951
00:59:12,973 --> 00:59:13,393
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

952
00:59:13,413 --> 00:59:13,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Sweet.

953
00:59:14,514 --> 00:59:17,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to at least one more call here.

954
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:18,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

955
00:59:18,517 --> 00:59:18,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

956
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:21,679
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Legend of Zaku.

957
00:59:21,879 --> 00:59:22,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Legend of Zaku.

958
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,561
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind, buddy?

959
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:27,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Just ranting on the Internet.

960
00:59:28,348 --> 00:59:38,317
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, how people are just bitching and moaning about how one PS3 game, Unreal Tournament 3, is actually getting keyboard and mouse support.

961
00:59:38,777 --> 00:59:43,621
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to see that as an iTunes review, by the way, as an iTunes review of this program.

962
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,603
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just ranting on the internets.

963
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:48,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

964
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:49,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, go ahead.

965
00:59:49,847 --> 01:00:05,861
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, they're saying that it's going to give, you know, PC gamers who basically grew up on keyboard and mouse, myself, it's going to give them an advantage over the folks who use Nexus just to play the game, and there's just some back and forth arguing.

966
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:06,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what do you think?

967
01:00:07,022 --> 01:00:10,445
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it really that big a deal, or should people just shut up about it, or what?

968
01:00:11,105 --> 01:00:17,751
[SPEAKER_00]: The only exceptions to, you know, the only good controls that I've seen so far, you know, in console first-person shooters...

969
01:00:18,709 --> 01:00:20,030
[SPEAKER_00]: His golden eye in Perfect Dark.

970
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:20,690
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

971
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:27,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they had the benefit of the joystick on the N64 and it actually felt nice on your hands.

972
01:00:29,574 --> 01:00:37,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, stuff like Halo, honestly, you know, personally I found it really hard to just, you know, to actually aim.

973
01:00:38,659 --> 01:00:44,361
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that very difficult with every other first person shooter that I've seen on the console.

974
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:45,722
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just horrible.

975
01:00:46,414 --> 01:00:50,576
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that they had a keyboard and mouse, it's easier for me to transition.

976
01:00:53,477 --> 01:01:08,102
[SPEAKER_00]: But then on the other side, you could actually use 6-axis to basically aim up and down, and then you could just use the D-pad to move forward, backwards, side to side.

977
01:01:08,262 --> 01:01:14,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Since you brought up Halo, there are current existing 360 games that will use any USB keyboard.

978
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy XI is what I'm thinking of.

979
01:01:16,661 --> 01:01:22,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think that Halo 3 ought to accept a mouse and a keyboard, USB mouse and USB keyboard as possible control devices?

980
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:26,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to throw the PC gamers a bone, at least.

981
01:01:27,006 --> 01:01:32,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, they're still out there and that would pretty much be on getting Halo 3 if it had that.

982
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:42,914
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just hook up a mouse and keyboard and then I could just play in my own comfort zone without having to go through hell trying to learn the controls and trying to be good at them.

983
01:01:43,435 --> 01:01:44,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm, interesting.

984
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:46,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

985
01:01:47,891 --> 01:01:52,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Maximum Tune pawns Initial D, that's all I have to say.

986
01:01:52,853 --> 01:01:53,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

987
01:01:54,614 --> 01:01:54,974
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?

988
01:01:57,275 --> 01:01:58,195
[SPEAKER_00]: What, Maximum Tune?

989
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:07,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I thought you said you wanted to comment on Initial D. No, I said Maximum Tune is greater than Initial D. Certainly when it comes to the soundtrack, I would agree.

990
01:02:08,419 --> 01:02:11,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that too, and the fact that it's more real than Initial D.

991
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:17,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, Racing Game fans, if you disagree with Zaku, call him at home.

992
01:02:18,632 --> 01:02:19,533
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can't give you the number.

993
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:19,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

994
01:02:20,633 --> 01:02:22,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, Zaku, for your call, as always.

995
01:02:22,094 --> 01:02:22,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care, buddy.

996
01:02:23,194 --> 01:02:23,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

997
01:02:23,634 --> 01:02:23,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

998
01:02:24,775 --> 01:02:25,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, let's go to the next call.

999
01:02:26,055 --> 01:02:27,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1000
01:02:27,235 --> 01:02:27,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1001
01:02:28,976 --> 01:02:30,977
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ranma, the official spoken at a chat room.

1002
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:31,837
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everyone?

1003
01:02:31,997 --> 01:02:32,778
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, Ranma.

1004
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:33,938
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing, my friend?

1005
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.

1006
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,941
[SPEAKER_02]: How is everybody else over there?

1007
01:02:38,561 --> 01:02:38,941
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm okay.

1008
01:02:38,961 --> 01:02:40,301
[SPEAKER_12]: The other two are kind of quiet tonight.

1009
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:42,122
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't want to participate in phone calls tonight.

1010
01:02:42,162 --> 01:02:42,762
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what's going on.

1011
01:02:42,782 --> 01:02:45,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine, just have, you know, a lot in my mind.

1012
01:02:45,683 --> 01:02:48,203
[SPEAKER_12]: They're having chat room sex online, actually.

1013
01:02:48,263 --> 01:02:48,643
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

1014
01:02:48,743 --> 01:02:49,764
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to take calls here.

1015
01:02:50,384 --> 01:02:51,204
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1016
01:02:51,384 --> 01:02:53,644
[SPEAKER_12]: But then, you know what, DarkSakura, you talk to Ranma.

1017
01:02:53,905 --> 01:02:54,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Ranma.

1018
01:02:54,325 --> 01:02:55,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to go pee anyway.

1019
01:02:55,265 --> 01:02:55,865
[SPEAKER_12]: You talk to Ranma.

1020
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:58,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's really fucking good radio, Rob.

1021
01:02:59,326 --> 01:03:00,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Way to go.

1022
01:03:00,106 --> 01:03:00,826
[SPEAKER_12]: He needs to go pee.

1023
01:03:01,106 --> 01:03:03,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's just, yeah, way to go, Rob.

1024
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to the bathroom.

1025
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:06,375
[SPEAKER_02]: What a wuss.

1026
01:03:07,796 --> 01:03:08,496
[SPEAKER_02]: What a wuss.

1027
01:03:10,157 --> 01:03:10,697
[SPEAKER_05]: So hi.

1028
01:03:10,717 --> 01:03:12,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey.

1029
01:03:13,197 --> 01:03:13,898
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind?

1030
01:03:13,918 --> 01:03:14,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a question.

1031
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:15,218
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1032
01:03:15,238 --> 01:03:16,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a question for you.

1033
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:19,019
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1034
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:33,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I read an article on Consumer sometime back about people complaining about GameStop, the fact that they open up the video games and put it on display, and then when they sell them, they sell them at the full price, they'd rather knock a couple bucks off.

1035
01:03:34,775 --> 01:03:35,856
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about that?

1036
01:03:36,096 --> 01:03:39,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first of all, I have no affiliation with GameStop whatsoever anymore.

1037
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:41,860
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine, I'm just saying.

1038
01:03:42,481 --> 01:03:46,844
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, they don't do that with all of their games.

1039
01:03:46,884 --> 01:03:48,525
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the last one.

1040
01:03:48,886 --> 01:03:50,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And it hasn't been played.

1041
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:54,109
[SPEAKER_05]: The disc has not been physically touched on the thing.

1042
01:03:54,129 --> 01:03:55,931
[SPEAKER_05]: It has not been inside of the system.

1043
01:03:56,331 --> 01:03:58,853
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an unused game.

1044
01:03:59,013 --> 01:04:00,754
[SPEAKER_05]: It is only that the case has been opened.

1045
01:04:02,516 --> 01:04:03,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

1046
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:04,257
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right on that, but

1047
01:04:04,773 --> 01:04:16,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess from my point of view from working retail, it seems like it belongs in an open box status where you want still new, it's open, and technically you really can't say it's new so you're going to knock a couple of dollars off.

1048
01:04:16,502 --> 01:04:18,563
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like a shades of gray when you think about it.

1049
01:04:18,763 --> 01:04:23,827
[SPEAKER_05]: I think open box really should apply to like hardware, like appliances.

1050
01:04:23,907 --> 01:04:32,013
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing with demo machines as well, but I remember a friend of mine, my friend Patty, we were looking for a game.

1051
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:33,094
[SPEAKER_02]: We found it.

1052
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:46,071
[SPEAKER_02]: but they wouldn't knock like a couple bucks off because it was like a display box you know they took the game out and all of that and the boxes are a little bit faded I mean they could at least get something well I think that um

1053
01:04:46,727 --> 01:04:47,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, look at it this way.

1054
01:04:47,988 --> 01:04:58,311
[SPEAKER_05]: If ever you go to the bookstore and you have books that are shrink-wrapped, you know, but you have books that are unwrapped, they're still going to sell you the book at the same price unless the book itself is damaged.

1055
01:04:58,912 --> 01:05:07,295
[SPEAKER_05]: If the game is not damaged, if the case is not damaged, then there's no reason for them to make any differentiation between it.

1056
01:05:10,176 --> 01:05:13,137
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right, but it's just that some people argue about that.

1057
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:18,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's one of the reasons I try not to shop at GameStop unless I really have to, you know?

1058
01:05:18,855 --> 01:05:24,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't shop at GameStop anymore at all, so don't blame me there.

1059
01:05:25,461 --> 01:05:26,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to GameCrazy.

1060
01:05:26,241 --> 01:05:29,344
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no GameCrazy down here in New York.

1061
01:05:29,664 --> 01:05:30,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I know of.

1062
01:05:30,905 --> 01:05:32,507
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be attached to a Hollywood video.

1063
01:05:33,214 --> 01:05:33,734
[SPEAKER_05]: if you got them.

1064
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:37,556
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a Hollywood video, but there is no GameCrazy there.

1065
01:05:37,797 --> 01:05:40,718
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sad.

1066
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:46,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, GameCrazy sells old games, and that's why I love them.

1067
01:05:47,202 --> 01:05:48,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just because Dan works there.

1068
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it works for me, definitely.

1069
01:05:53,425 --> 01:05:55,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, is there anything else, Ranma?

1070
01:05:57,207 --> 01:05:58,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to call you out, Sky.

1071
01:05:58,768 --> 01:06:01,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired of you talking trash about Vista.

1072
01:06:01,529 --> 01:06:02,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I'm tired of it.

1073
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,222
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not really talking a lot of trash about Vista, I'm just not that interested in it.

1074
01:06:08,743 --> 01:06:15,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the thing is, Windows XP, every box of XP is coming out, oh, new upgrades, brand new hardware.

1075
01:06:15,447 --> 01:06:22,271
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time the new OS came out, it's definitely time to upgrade, because it's been like maybe two or three years since the last upgrade.

1076
01:06:22,491 --> 01:06:29,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Since it was Vista, it's been a while since, you know, the last operating system was XP, so you got newer hardware for Vista to support.

1077
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,161
[SPEAKER_02]: and people complain about bugs left and right.

1078
01:06:32,482 --> 01:06:39,166
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those bugs do not even apply unless you're like a hardcore higher end user doing stuff you shouldn't even be doing.

1079
01:06:40,107 --> 01:06:41,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Why should I upgrade to Vista?

1080
01:06:43,549 --> 01:06:51,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, personally because there are newer hardware that's coming out that XP may not be able to support and the fact that XP and Vista

1081
01:06:51,664 --> 01:06:53,985
[SPEAKER_02]: is more secure, is more stable.

1082
01:07:14,602 --> 01:07:15,583
[SPEAKER_02]: We're perfectly honest.

1083
01:07:15,723 --> 01:07:19,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say now because if that was the case, I'd be very updated.

1084
01:07:19,628 --> 01:07:21,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew, he's already updated.

1085
01:07:21,209 --> 01:07:34,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting a month before I get all my hardware ready to go because I want to really try out this copy that's out in stores because I shouldn't be really saying this, but I was a beta tester and I've been playing around with it since it was mobile and I've seen...

1086
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:39,342
[SPEAKER_02]: The changes from 2004 all the way up to now.

1087
01:07:39,442 --> 01:07:41,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma, I got to be honest, you're not selling it to me.

1088
01:07:41,484 --> 01:07:44,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you're telling me that because everyone else is doing it, I should do it.

1089
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing the best that I can.

1090
01:07:47,649 --> 01:07:49,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I work retail, you know.

1091
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:56,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you don't work for... Look, let me tell you straight up, honestly, if you don't want to upgrade to Vista, that's fine.

1092
01:07:56,716 --> 01:07:58,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to each his own.

1093
01:07:58,518 --> 01:08:01,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, personally, I plan to do the upgrade in due time.

1094
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,902
[SPEAKER_02]: XP is still going to be around for a couple of years.

1095
01:08:04,426 --> 01:08:06,568
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1096
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:14,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read some chat comments on this and then wrap up here.

1097
01:08:14,355 --> 01:08:18,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I see James Patrick says, you can control audio for every separate program in Vista.

1098
01:08:18,138 --> 01:08:19,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Trying to help you out there with some good reasons.

1099
01:08:20,761 --> 01:08:21,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

1100
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:22,422
[SPEAKER_12]: What was it?

1101
01:08:22,462 --> 01:08:25,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody said they are on Windows.

1102
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:26,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, NM64 says, Vista?

1103
01:08:27,066 --> 01:08:28,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Heck, I still prefer Windows 2000.

1104
01:08:28,328 --> 01:08:28,688
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1105
01:08:30,612 --> 01:08:34,395
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well Ranma, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.

1106
01:08:34,455 --> 01:08:35,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Any last words for our listeners?

1107
01:08:37,937 --> 01:08:39,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to Uni's radio on Shoutcat.

1108
01:08:39,798 --> 01:08:42,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the name of it, but she should be posting it in the chat room.

1109
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, I'm sure she appreciates the plug.

1110
01:08:44,882 --> 01:08:45,262
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care.

1111
01:08:45,902 --> 01:08:46,923
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.

1112
01:08:46,943 --> 01:08:48,664
[SPEAKER_12]: But don't listen to it right now, because we're on the air.

1113
01:08:51,606 --> 01:08:52,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, take care.

1114
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:54,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, thanks so much for the call, and...

1115
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,854
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line now.

1116
01:08:57,894 --> 01:09:00,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much to those of you that got through tonight and participated in the show.

1117
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,255
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate it, as always.

1118
01:09:02,675 --> 01:09:05,276
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go around and ask if there's any last-minute stories.

1119
01:09:05,936 --> 01:09:06,777
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, anything?

1120
01:09:08,017 --> 01:09:09,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Not particularly.

1121
01:09:09,758 --> 01:09:12,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know, I'd like to remind everybody that I'm really awesome.

1122
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,559
[SPEAKER_04]: And, okay.

1123
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,180
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a story.

1124
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:16,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1125
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:20,361
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a thing that's coming out in Japan that's actually kind of funny.

1126
01:09:20,481 --> 01:09:25,463
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a painting program for the DS, and you basically paint, like,

1127
01:09:26,844 --> 01:09:31,085
[SPEAKER_09]: A Japanese man has blamed his 6-axis for a new impotence problem.

1128
01:09:57,888 --> 01:10:00,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, Mr. Owie, what's his name?

1129
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:04,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Owie Bailey says he cannot get an erection anymore.

1130
01:10:04,532 --> 01:10:09,835
[SPEAKER_12]: He says having his controller in his lap in close proximity to his penis has left him unable to perform.

1131
01:10:10,235 --> 01:10:14,277
[SPEAKER_12]: He thinks the controller is sending out a Bluetooth frequency that can cause bodily harm.

1132
01:10:14,858 --> 01:10:20,260
[SPEAKER_12]: He has contacted Sony to find out if he is not the only one having a problem from the PlayStation 3 controller, but has yet to get a response.

1133
01:10:20,681 --> 01:10:23,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Bailey plans on going to the doctor this week to try to get some answers.

1134
01:10:23,862 --> 01:10:26,344
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Bluetooth gives you...

1135
01:10:28,092 --> 01:10:29,313
[SPEAKER_12]: Impotence, apparently.

1136
01:10:29,833 --> 01:10:30,914
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell is this?

1137
01:10:30,994 --> 01:10:35,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not... I think he just has emotional problems, and that's why he's impotent.

1138
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:38,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Why is he trying to play the game with his penis, anyway?

1139
01:10:38,499 --> 01:10:42,221
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like he's trying to put the controller right there to maybe, like, look at a picture of a pretty girl.

1140
01:10:42,241 --> 01:10:45,743
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know about you, but when I play the game, I don't have my hand down there.

1141
01:10:45,863 --> 01:10:48,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the controller in my hands.

1142
01:10:48,405 --> 01:10:50,246
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the Al Bundy way of playing video games.

1143
01:10:50,286 --> 01:10:52,228
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, one hand down your pants, one, yeah, there you go.

1144
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:57,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, that's awfully lazy, and to be honest, I don't see that...

1145
01:10:58,206 --> 01:10:58,966
[SPEAKER_09]: That's stupid.

1146
01:11:00,007 --> 01:11:00,947
[SPEAKER_09]: How old is this guy?

1147
01:11:02,128 --> 01:11:02,668
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't say.

1148
01:11:03,309 --> 01:11:04,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

1149
01:11:04,749 --> 01:11:09,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm betting it's not anything that has to do with... Well, you know, here's what it is.

1150
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:16,455
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because the fucking imagery from the PlayStation 3 is so fucking sexy, his wife just doesn't do it for him anymore.

1151
01:11:17,836 --> 01:11:22,298
[SPEAKER_12]: NintendoManiac64 wants to know, why would you put the 6-axis on your dick?

1152
01:11:22,338 --> 01:11:23,279
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no rumble!

1153
01:11:25,453 --> 01:11:27,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess that's a good question to ask.

1154
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:33,019
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the OL Army recruits, meaning they haven't changed their nickname yet, says, That's how the Power Glove was invented.

1155
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Now you're playing with power.

1156
01:11:35,961 --> 01:11:36,681
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so bad.

1157
01:11:38,102 --> 01:11:38,422
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1158
01:11:39,703 --> 01:11:44,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, let's go around, if there's no more last-minute stories, and get everybody's final thought.

1159
01:11:45,147 --> 01:11:46,448
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll start with you tonight, DarkSakura.

1160
01:11:46,528 --> 01:11:47,309
[SPEAKER_12]: What's your final thought?

1161
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:49,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me money.

1162
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:53,353
[SPEAKER_12]: My final thought is Guinness World Records.

1163
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:54,770
[SPEAKER_12]: It's my final thought.

1164
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:56,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I've had like three glasses of it this week.

1165
01:11:56,731 --> 01:11:57,291
[SPEAKER_12]: It's good stuff.

1166
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, your final thought, please.

1167
01:11:59,891 --> 01:12:05,973
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is it's a lot harder to put PlayStation 1 games on your PSP.

1168
01:12:07,033 --> 01:12:08,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Were you successful in your attempts?

1169
01:12:08,794 --> 01:12:17,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I put it on there, but the thing is you need to have a bunch of different files from Hot Shots 2 actually from the PlayStation Store.

1170
01:12:17,656 --> 01:12:22,997
[SPEAKER_09]: And then because with each firmware update they change the encoding on the PS1 games, so

1171
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:24,197
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1172
01:12:36,462 --> 01:12:40,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

1173
01:12:40,203 --> 01:12:40,944
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are awesome.

1174
01:12:40,964 --> 01:12:43,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember, we do this for free for you guys.

1175
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:50,247
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you like what you hear, please tell two friends about Orange Lounge Radio because that way if you tell two friends, then they tell two friends and so on and so on.

1176
01:12:50,588 --> 01:12:51,988
[SPEAKER_12]: We slowly take over the world.

1177
01:12:52,008 --> 01:12:52,768
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how it works.

1178
01:12:52,888 --> 01:12:59,291
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how we get our name out there because we don't have any big corporate magazine or game company or website that backs us.

1179
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:01,735
[SPEAKER_12]: We're just us, three gamers like you guys.

1180
01:13:01,775 --> 01:13:03,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks so much to our chat room for joining us tonight.

1181
01:13:04,217 --> 01:13:05,758
[SPEAKER_12]: And thanks so much to all our callers tonight.

1182
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:06,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a great week.

1183
01:13:06,419 --> 01:13:07,219
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see you next week.

1184
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:08,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to be here, DarkSakura?

1185
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,481
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you had a week off coming up.

1186
01:13:09,501 --> 01:13:10,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you here next week?

1187
01:13:11,283 --> 01:13:11,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1188
01:13:12,303 --> 01:13:13,564
[SPEAKER_12]: There was some week you had off.

1189
01:13:13,604 --> 01:13:15,046
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember if it was this week or next.

1190
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,448
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, hopefully we'll all be here next week.

1191
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:21,431
[SPEAKER_12]: But if not, then some of us will see you here next week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1192
01:13:21,491 --> 01:13:21,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Take care.
