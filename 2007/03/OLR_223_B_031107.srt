Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, March 11, 2007 to be exact.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You might be thinking to yourself, if you're listening to this on your iPod or your Zune or whatever it is, your Zen that you have right now,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
you might be thinking, or your PSP, you might be thinking, wait a minute, it's way past March 11, what are you talking about?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, we record live on Sunday nights and then split up our show into two segments,

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
because we talk a lot here at Orange Lounge Radio and a lot about games, of course.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And we split it up into two segments and offer it on the podcast stream on Mondays and Wednesdays for you to listen to throughout the week.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And if you guys are ready, Dark Soccer and Loki, my lovely co-host in crime, we'll get back to the gaming news.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And we'll start it off with, that was a nice hearty okay there.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We'll start it off with the Nintendo keynote from Gay Developers Conference,

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
because we talked a lot in part eight about the Sony keynote and how Sony's winning a lot of people back over thanks to their announcements about home.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, what about Nintendo?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, Nintendo basically made only two unveilings in their conference at GDC,

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and that was a new Mario Galaxy trailer and the fact that it would be out this year,

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and a type of, I don't know what you'd want to call it, Mii Idol or something like that,

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
basically a do you like this Mii, it's like a Mii popularity channel has been announced for the Nintendo Wii.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Not a lot of announcements outside of that, but then again, a lot of people are saying,

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
ah Nintendo you guys suck, Sony made all these announcements and Nintendo you didn't do crap.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well, keep in mind folks, it was Game Developers Conference.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What did Miyamoto talk about?

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He talked about the WIFO meter, he talked about how Mario 128 kind of evolved into the game Peekman,

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
he talked about game development types of things.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
On that end, Nintendo really didn't disappoint I don't think.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But, you know, if you were there looking for the E3 Bang and Fireworks press conference,

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I guess you were going to be a little disappointed.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But of course we remember that story last week that said, hey Nintendo's got some stock things going on,

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
they're not going to be able to make any big announcements to GDC whether they want to or not.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So there you have it.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So unfortunately the only little trinkets you got there from Nintendo were those two things.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But curious, what do you guys think about that?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Do either of you guys watch the new Galaxy trailer? What did you think of it?

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That was okay, it just looked like Galaxy though.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I mean it wasn't anything different that I've seen.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The graphics were pretty rad.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I got to say I'm more excited about Super Paper Mario though after seeing some more footage of that than I am the Mario Galaxy.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Because it looks like you can flip 2D to 3D at the touch of a button.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Like if you're playing the 2D thing and you see a wheel thing.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There was one video I saw a wheel, a spiked wheel was coming at you.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You hit a button to go to 3D and then you can run around the wheel.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And then you go back to the 2D mode. It's so crazy.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I liked it. It was very cool.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So that was something I'm looking forward to way more than any of the other stuff that was talked about unfortunately.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Smash Brothers!

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll give Mario Galaxy a try of course.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I want my Smash Brothers.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We'll see.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Again, if you want to give your comments in chat, it's chat.orangeloungelounge.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's the second I've ever done this show.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm out of it tonight. Something's wrong.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
There's something in the water I'm drinking tonight.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
actdef says Super Paper Mario for the win.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
BlackWolf was at Game Developers Conference and played Super Paper Mario.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He says Super Paper Mario equals fun.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The A button goes to 3D.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Joshi says Super Paper Mario is when I get a Wii.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So it looks like a lot of folks are very excited.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
ssj100matt says yay more channels but how about Galaxy, Smash, and Metroid?

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There's your comments from chat.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This week we saw some pretty good stuff coming to the Virtual Console,

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
including Super Ghouls and Ghosts.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That was, of course, very fucking hard as usual.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And of course, Sword of Vermillion.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And Elevator Action for the role that was on the NES.

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And this week though, what are we going to be getting?

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, from what I've been hearing, I think Sonic Spinball was among those.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I know it was on the Japan launch there, at least what they're getting this week.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And if I remember correctly, they also were getting Excite Bike

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sweet! Oh my god, I love Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Serious? No, I'm like being serious.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I totally love that game on Super Nintendo.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And Turbografx-16 Fire Pro Wrestling combination tag.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But I know Spinball was confirmed coming out this week on the Virtual Console for Japan.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I can't remember about the US though.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Wasn't Tecmo Bowl discovered somehow, whether it be the ESRB thing or looking at the website thing?

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think it was on the website, yeah.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's still not officially out, so maybe that is on its way.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I think they saw Spinball there too, if I remember correctly.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Interesting.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can't remember.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But you know, you're going to expect some about three games tomorrow.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Or Monday.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Anything on Virtual Console that you were dying for still not out?

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I mean, I got Kid Icarus, so I kind of got my wish.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I have R-Type.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I know, but anything not out that you still want.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I mean, obviously Guardian Legend, but realistically, something from either Nintendo itself or one of their very close third-party developers.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Snow Brothers.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Snow Brothers. That's an interesting choice.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I remember that game, actually.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I would like to see, and I know Jamie hates this one, but I really like Strider on the NES.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I didn't say I hated it.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Actually, the game was based off of the Strider manga.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, okay.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But you told me once you hated it because the arcade one is so much better.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I didn't say I hated it.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I just said the arcade one is so much better.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Wouldn't it be neat, though, one week to get Strider on NES and Strider on Genesis?

105
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That would be kind of cool, wouldn't it?

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Mega Man would be my other wish.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, they need some Mega Man games on there would be pretty cool.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Actually, Capcom just needs some more stuff on there.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I would think it would be pretty cool.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You know, I was a fan of this game, at least.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Uniracers.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't know.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No one really played that game from Nintendo.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We've got a minute chat room here.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Of course, you know, you bring up Virtual Console.

117
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Everyone makes their list of demands.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
James Patrick says, Secret of Mana and Evermore.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Morrie says, Earthbound, please.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Ryoma says, Ice Climbers.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Actually, Ice Climbers is already up.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Go check it out.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Unless he was referring to something else, but I think that's the list.

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Salamander.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A life force in this country, but that would be cool.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
ActDef says, Kirby Superstar.

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There you go.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Mel B on our staff says, Tecmo Bowl, but will it be licensed?

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Not likely.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Just leave it in there with the old, like, 88 lineup or whatever that game had in it.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That would be funny.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Wouldn't it?

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Mm-hmm.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Mm-hmm.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Then you could still play the 40.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You could play as the 49ers and actually be good because it's 1988.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That was a sports joke.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't make those very often.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It was a sports joke for you guys out there.

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, for those who are disgusted with Rob's, you know, sports jokes, no, not really.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This has absolutely nothing to do with sports.

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We have Chocobo Tales coming out in May in the UK.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That is, it's coming out April 3rd here in the U.S.

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But you play as a Chocobo and you have to, you know, stop the bad guy from, you know,

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I guess being all evil even though he's all evil.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So, you go around and you do mini games and you build up a deck in card battles and save

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
the universe on your DS through the Wi-Fi.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So, it's saying that it's going to be, like I said, released in May in the UK and April

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
3rd in the U.S. but it's already out in Japan.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'd really like to know if anyone's already played it because I'm sort of thinking about

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
it.

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
All right.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
In an unannounced feature, it will actually enhance your DS to smell like Chocobo, actually.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Kentucky Ferraga Chocobo.

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No, but remember in, like, one of the Final Fantasy, I think it was Final Fantasy II U.S.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
for Japan, you would have to use the big carrot when it came up on the screen that said, it

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
smells like Chocobo and you kind of always wondered, what the hell does a Chocobo smell

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
like?

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Does it smell like farts or roses or what?

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Smells like chicken shit.

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Kentucky Fried Chicken?

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What?

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Smells like Kentucky Ferraga Chocobo.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Sorry.

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, okay, maybe I'm full of shit on that DS feature but this is something I'm not kidding

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
you about.

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The Opera DS browser is coming to North America on June 4th.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Unfortunately, you can't use Flash, you can't use video, you can't use sound, and you can't

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
use PDF.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But you can use the stylus and what's kind of cool is that you can have some handwriting

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
recognition there.

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The browser will be retailing for about $32 in Japan, $52 in Europe, no price announced

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
here yet but I guess based off those prices you could speculate $34 or $39.99, right?

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That would be a fair statement.

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I guess something to compete with the PSP a little bit although this is not included

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
with the DS.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's kind of something extra.

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But if you've ever wanted to surf the internet while on the go on your DS, there you have

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
it.

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I would not buy that.

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm not feeling this.

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm really not.

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You know what would have been cool is if I had the internet channel on my Wii then I

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
could beam it over to my DS.

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Where's that?

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Whatever happened to that functionality?

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Wasn't that something they said you could do at one point?

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Is that the DS would interface with the Wii?

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, they're going to have that with some future games but they may add that later.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I have a feeling that's something up their sleeve.

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
DS demos on your Wii a little later on.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why not?

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't know.

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But one thing I was going to say is I think that they've done this probably better at

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
home brew.

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,560
I mean, really the only problem and the reason why they don't have a lot of the flash support

197
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,640
and stuff is because there's not enough RAM in the system and there's no storage.

198
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,120
It's just pretty much the cart itself which doesn't hold that much.

199
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,480
You would probably need to have some sort of Game Boy Advance thing plugged in the bottom.

200
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,760
In fact, I think that's what they did in Japan.

201
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
A couple different versions of that.

202
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,760
Joshie16 wants to know is there going to be an OLR DS page since we have the PSP page

203
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,280
and a Wii one in the works.

204
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Probably not.

205
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
I can't imagine that either.

206
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,480
I don't think that many people are going to be using that.

207
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,800
Maybe like five people would use it if even that.

208
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,080
Do we even have five listeners of Orange Launch Radio?

209
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,320
I don't think we do actually so I don't think there'd be a lot of points to do that.

210
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,800
Five listeners of Orange Launch Radio?

211
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Yeah.

212
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,420
I think we have more than that.

213
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,420
Maybe a handful.

214
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,420
I don't know.

215
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,220
The first episode we only had five listeners but my how we've grown since then.

216
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,480
Thank you guys so much for supporting us over the years.

217
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,200
Our fifth anniversary is coming up in just two months.

218
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,300
Two months at the station but I think we're actually going to celebrate it with the first

219
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:10,160
live show which was June 23, 2002.

220
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,080
Last week we talked about how the Wii didn't have Wii support for third parties.

221
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,920
This week SNK's president says that they're not letting third parties have online capabilities

222
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,440
either.

223
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,220
Which is funny because Sega's got a Pachinko game coming out that does have online and

224
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:36,640
does have Wii support so I basically ask are they just not letting SNK have online support

225
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,560
or Wii support because to be honest I mean and I'm sure everyone can agree with me there

226
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,820
haven't really been any new SNK games coming out other than these collections or ports

227
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:54,160
of older games so I don't know maybe you should make something new for a change and from what

228
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,160
I hear I guess their next game is an art of fighting you know collection.

229
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,160
I can remember that got brought up on last week's show yeah.

230
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
Yay.

231
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
All right.

232
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
I can't wait for that.

233
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,800
I'm sure it's going to be uber awesome.

234
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,760
Totally retro hurrah.

235
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,840
Make something new.

236
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:19,240
All right well let's go on to another topic shall we?

237
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,360
Well this is something that we've been of course talking about since the announcement

238
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:32,280
of having our E3 taken from us but there is going to be E3 this year if you were invited

239
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:38,520
it's July 11th through 13th to quote the invite it says the opportunity to engage in one on

240
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,920
one meetings with leading game company executives in an intimate setting as well as network

241
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,680
socialized and test pilot major company offerings.

242
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,000
Well I got invited.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Congratulations.

244
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,280
So if it works out for me I'm going to go but I'm actually I sort of do see more now

245
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,080
of the logic in them changing it to a more of a meeting based I think we're still going

246
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,480
to have the demos and such it's just not going to be the big over the top production that

247
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,500
you know E3 was in the past.

248
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,120
And not really many people have figured out why you know people are getting invited.

249
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,600
I was actually looking just earlier today Joystiq ran an interesting story on the whole

250
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,560
thing and apparently they're saying they said here in the story this week that some journalists

251
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,920
received their invites but many did not and interesting enough Jamie did get an invite

252
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,880
but and so did someone else on our staff who works behind the scenes.

253
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,800
But Loki and I have not.

254
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,400
So where's the love you guys?

255
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,880
I know there's some developers out there listen to us sniff sniff cry cry send us an email

256
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,800
we want to go we'll interview you have you on the show we'll play beat the host with

257
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,800
you we'll bring our rig.

258
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,000
No but I do hope you know I had a lot of fun at the E3 shows and not just you know the

259
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,120
over the top stuff but actually just getting to play the games and reporting on it so I

260
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,680
hope from that perspective we get to go.

261
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,080
But if not then we'll just rely on Jamie she'll be a one woman show.

262
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,600
No offense you know I'm from the room where we kind of speculated yesterday or how people

263
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
got invited.

264
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,160
It's basically if you've had meetings with people you probably got invited type thing.

265
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,080
I don't know it's just like a lot of times like we didn't go to I mean we went to meetings

266
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,800
for some things but I got a lot of accomplishments booth tours and stuff like that and actually

267
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,640
meeting people face to face instead of just you know actually having meetings and stuff.

268
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,920
Rob went to meetings with me.

269
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,040
Yeah it's at this point it's really all speculation we just don't know how they're picking it.

270
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,280
It might also have to do with how you registered.

271
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,400
Who knows?

272
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I pre-registered.

273
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,680
Yeah so that was my request.

274
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,280
Some of the meetings that I went to were ones that required you to scan your card.

275
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,520
I don't know we'll see we can speculate till we're blue in the face but E3 is still a few

276
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,040
months away we shall see what happens.

277
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,400
We'll let you know the minute we hear if we're going or not we'll let you know.

278
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,000
Well shifting gears completely here going from E3 to talk about politics a little bit.

279
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,740
Game politics ran a story earlier this week about the video games made me do it defense.

280
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,960
Well apparently what happened is that this 19 year old Patrick Morris actually shot his

281
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,880
15 year old boy with a shotgun and used the good old excuse the video games made me do

282
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,720
it and his mom even you know tried to go in there and say he would just go into his room

283
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,920
and play those video games.

284
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,640
Well the prosecution brought out Dr. Michael Knapp from Ashland Oregon and he said it was

285
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,120
ridiculous to blame video games.

286
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,160
Moreover he said while you usually can't predict violent behavior other risk factors in Morris'

287
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,680
life such as his drug use and emotional disorders were much stronger factors.

288
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,240
So after 30 minutes of deliberations he she sentenced the judge sentenced Morris to life

289
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
in prison.

290
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,200
The video games made me do it defense carried no weight.

291
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,320
Because well it should have not had any weight because that's a stupid defense.

292
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,080
Because it's the hip hop music that did it.

293
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,320
No one made you press the power button asshole.

294
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,080
It was a hip hop music game that made me do it.

295
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,920
It's all Def Jam icons.

296
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,840
Def Jam icon absolutely.

297
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
But anyways.

298
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,600
Actually if anything makes me want to go out and get a shotgun and shoot people it would

299
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,040
probably be Sonic on the Playstation 3.

300
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,120
I don't know about you.

301
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,560
Please don't take me literally.

302
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,360
I hope you guys know I'm joking.

303
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:31,200
Well sometimes we talk about you know harming the certain beta testers of online functions

304
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,000
in say portable Grand Theft Auto games.

305
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,480
Because you fucking sucked at it.

306
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,360
But anyways.

307
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,440
One thing though that's going to make people you know especially Sega make some more games

308
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,440
is this online poll that they have where they're trying to figure out the interests of older

309
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,760
franchises what people want remakes of and so far Nite seems to be winning out.

310
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,200
Which is pretty awesome.

311
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,760
That was the funniest thing I think I've ever seen.

312
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,680
I looked up and randomly Nelly was poking Loki in the head.

313
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,920
Yes.

314
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,840
Anyway that was really good radio.

315
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,080
So Nite would you like to see Nite's come back?

316
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Oh hell yeah.

317
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Nite's would be awesome.

318
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:22,640
And you know I think it would be really good though to move on to something else that doesn't

319
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,960
have to do with video game news.

320
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,520
Really what would that be?

321
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
That would be the mailbag.

322
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,240
Ah but don't our emailers sometimes email us with video game related things?

323
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
I would hope so.

324
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Sometimes but I ignore it.

325
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,680
Alright well let's open up the old mailbag and see what's in store.

326
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,320
If you want to email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

327
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:49,800
Um today's first email actually comes from Grin without a cat.

328
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,720
Hi um hey guys I've dug up some sales figures for PS2 hardware after listening to you trying

329
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,800
to figure out why Sony hates Europe.

330
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,200
I don't think it's sales figures at the moment there's been 25 million PS2 sold in Japan

331
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,880
47 million in North America and 45 million sold in Europe.

332
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,120
The slimline model is actually sold better in Europe than anywhere else with 18 million

333
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,520
against North America 16 million and Japan 6 million.

334
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,760
Europe also seems to be the one who takes some interest in their casual and innovative

335
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,400
games such as Itoy, Singstar and Buzz.

336
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,080
A quiz game with buzzer peripherals.

337
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,680
They've all been big big sellers and done really well with non gamers.

338
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,720
And it's not like Europe is short of PS3 game developers either.

339
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,120
Titles coming out of Europe include Burnout Wipeout, Grand Theft Auto, Heavenly Sword

340
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,840
Killzone Motorstorm, Little Big Planet, Singstar and The Darkness.

341
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,180
It's kind of ironic in a way.

342
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,000
Before Sony came along it was Nintendo that screwed Europe with games being released here

343
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
years later and price is way higher than we pay now.

344
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,920
Some games didn't even show up at all but first two generations and it was actually

345
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,120
seen as something of a savior to the European market of the now it appears Microsoft has

346
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,400
taken that role as Nintendo is still screwing us on game releases so after all that we still

347
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,960
don't know why Sony hates Europe love you grin without a cat.

348
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,560
I don't know it seems like every week we're getting some type of email from a European

349
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,720
listener and understandably so don't get me wrong but a European listener who is a little

350
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,040
bit upset because they're constantly getting screwed by the game companies so unfortunately

351
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't have an easy answer for you on that one but thank you for the insight we do appreciate

352
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
that.

353
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,440
I thought that I was actually very well thought out email so thank you for sending it.

354
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,960
Next one comes up is from Bear Who Drive Car please make Sky stop attempting accents especially

355
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,840
British that is all well I don't know what you're talking about Rob that your accent

356
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
really is.

357
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Carry on.

358
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Would you like to go out and have some tea?

359
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,960
It's really awful Bear Who Drive Car would you like to go out and have some tea a spot

360
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,240
of tea or are you going to continue to be a tit?

361
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:56,520
Next up comes from Sy this is dear olr hi grin anyhow on my world warcraft server cough

362
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,440
Duran cough I guess there's a guild called less qq more pew pew just thought it was funny

363
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,400
love this show you guys rock stuff like that.

364
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,200
The olr guild is on Ravencrest by the way if you want more information go to the forums

365
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,160
although that is a great name for a guild less qq more pew pew I should look that up

366
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,000
on the armory.

367
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,020
So how about this this one comes from Ali so I thought I would voice a few opinions

368
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,960
on your cynicism toward the ps3 my brother had the opportunity to play a ps3 a couple

369
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,320
of days ago and he told me it was really a lot of fun I believe he played resistance

370
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,900
fall of man in gran turismo hd now granted my brother is pretty hardcore gamer he pulled

371
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,720
strings to get himself an xbox 360 at launch got a ps2 at launch etc now I thought I would

372
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,440
remind you of the ps2 launch everyone told us we were crazy for spending that much time

373
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,920
that much on the game system and the dreamcast was so much better I also remember reading

374
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,640
that the emotion engine was nigh impossible to program for however once time passed the

375
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,520
ps2 gained traction price wise the price stayed even as flint inflation went on and people

376
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,360
cracked how to get the most out of their ee now look at the ps3 everyone says the 360

377
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,400
is 100 times better that the cell is near impossible to program for and that it was

378
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,800
too expensive I think that will happen in a year or two the ps2 will see revival and

379
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,720
will take the market other than that I literally got my 360 a half hour ago and I got cracked

380
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,320
down call of duty 3 gears of war saints row and test drive unlimited the reason I'm telling

381
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,080
you this is that I want some good um some music games I heard that ddr for 360 wasn't

382
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,040
too good and as far as I can tell guitar hero 2 is not on xbox 360 will guitar hero come

383
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,520
out for the xbox 360 and is ddr any good on 360 um yeah it is coming out on 360 I believe

384
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,460
April is the big month for guitar hero 2 I like this insert usual love the show dribble

385
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,560
here thank you uh boom boom rocket I don't know much about but people that have gotten

386
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,560
their hands on it say if you like music games you're gonna like yourself some boom boom

387
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,760
rocket uh there's that I don't know when that'll be out though knowing uh the release schedule

388
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,600
it could be summer it could be the end of the year um ddr on the 360 is actually it's

389
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,780
a it's not that bad it's just components of it are bad um but the game itself the main

390
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,320
core element of the game I mean what's ddr it's songs and steps the songs are great and

391
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,600
the steps are great so that's it it's it's a fine game it's just all the other stuff

392
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,600
around it like quest mode sucks and some of the other stuff is not so hot but uh the game

393
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,640
itself is fine um it depends how much do you love ddr I mean you're willing to spend 80

394
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,760
bucks on it that's the question but it's some good songs and they'll keep you in shape and

395
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:37,160
all that good stuff and our last email of the uh day is uh from uh azhp hey guys just

396
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,960
had a comment possibly a very long comment on what did I miss him oh sorry lanky style

397
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,800
was here and leaving and I was trying to kiss him on his bald head okay um on the email

398
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,480
you guys got last week on the topic of piracy affecting game development first of all I'd

399
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,280
like to say that the fact that nintendo puts out arguably higher quality games than sony

400
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,560
and microsoft is that they simply care more about the fun factor in the games than any

401
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:05,720
other developer out there uh shigeru miyamoto said in his gdc keynote that if at any point

402
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,240
during the development he feels they have lost sight of the fact that this game is supposed

403
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,960
to make people happy he scraps it and redoes it from the ground up that's devotion secondly

404
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,520
the reason we are seeing more and more rehash equals is not because the developers do not

405
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,360
have the resource to make entirely new franchises or because piracy is affecting them in an

406
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,160
adverse fashion it is because the higher ups at companies decide they tell their developers

407
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,440
make this the same game as last year and put a new title on it so you can generate large

408
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,980
revenues this is purely marketing and financial based decision and is probably not affected

409
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,520
at all by the piracy issue nintendo is not like other companies in this regard they spend

410
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,080
as much time as they want or need pushing it back pushing back release dates if necessary

411
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,720
to ensure the highest quality games not the highest quantity lastly nintendo's consoles

412
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,400
are not much harder to pirate are not any harder to pirate games on than the xbox uh

413
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,600
than the ps2 or xbox i have a mod chip in my gamecube and i burn my original discs to

414
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,720
many dvdrs so that i don't have to lug around giant dvd cases that gamecube games come in

415
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,360
as i travel a lot there are also mods that allow you to use full-size dvds for your games

416
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,960
so the argument that nintendo games are harder to pirate as a reason that nintendo is succeeding

417
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,440
is not valid i honestly don't think that any company looks at pirating as a major reason

418
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,120
what their games are not selling as well because most people who pirate games wouldn't buy

419
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,200
the games they did not have the opportunity to pirate them so the ratio of pirates to

420
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,040
mass consumers is really low and mostly for people with the technical know-how anyway

421
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,320
that's just my two cents i hope this sparks some discussion between all of you as i wanted

422
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,160
to show the corporate side of gaming as another reason why games are not as high quality as

423
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,520
they used to be hey freaking men i i would agree that piracy is something really that

424
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:53,120
not the masses really gets in on i mean um very few people would know how to put ddr

425
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,320
fifth mix on a psp loki uh or would know how to you know do some of that stuff you know

426
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,400
they would know how to pirate or mod a gamecube and all that stuff it's not an easy thing

427
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,220
to do your average person is not going to be able to do it i kind of think about when

428
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,500
piracy got really busted and got out of control and i think about napster and when did napster

429
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,320
really cross the line when like every media outlet started reporting on it and then every

430
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,640
college kid in the nation was using napster to download music off each other and to some

431
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,800
extent yeah the piracy still goes on today but it's not as easy as it used to be right

432
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,640
like remember it used to be like you just download maps napster type in metallica and

433
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,680
bam you get like any song you want it right yeah now you have to download limewire and

434
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,800
type in metallica and then and hopefully you connect to the server and you have to configure

435
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,040
and the thing isn't as user-friendly and you have to configure all that stuff it's not

436
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,820
as easy it's all about bit torrent and you use groups or new use net i'm not saying just

437
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,560
because it's not easy makes it right but i'm just you know that that is true that you know

438
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,360
you're probably never going to eliminate piracy completely but you can make it difficult enough

439
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:02,440
for that most people aren't going to figure out how to do it or care right yeah loki you're

440
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,360
just an exception you're a special child face it let's give him some donuts all right is

441
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:14,080
that it for the mailbag that would be it well einhänder is awesome send more email mailbag

442
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,960
orange laws you have einhänder on your psp yeah god damn you mailbag orange launch radio

443
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,160
dot com well this is something else we can get mad about because we didn't have this

444
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:31,520
this is kind of old news but because it's ending like now but australia actually had

445
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,440
a free xbox live gold service all weekend long that ran this weekend march 9th through

446
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,840
march 11th so if you're an xbox live silver subscriber in australia you got three days

447
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:49,720
worth of gold so pretty cool there and crackdown appears to be the game that a lot of folks

448
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,080
were going to take advantage of with their free xbox live gold accounts for the weekend

449
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,280
no word on who underwrote it though you know how like last time we got a free weekend wasn't

450
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,520
sponsored by somebody and i completely forgot who it was sponsored by so it must not have

451
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,280
been very effective marketing no discovery channel gave the gears of war maps it wasn't

452
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,320
discovery channel somebody else i don't know was it what i think it was some type of network

453
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,840
or tv show or something i'm sure somebody in chat room remembers who knows i'm trying

454
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,260
to see um maybe not history channel dark knight says history no i don't think it was a history

455
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:35,600
channel was it i don't know all righty anyways um so people love free xbox live gold weekends

456
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:43,880
people don't like bullet which and uh bullet which is really bad in fact kotaku among other

457
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:52,340
people including um was it costume get and gang game rankings.com have been ever so nice

458
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:58,320
to point out the flaws in bullet which including idiotic ai unfinished graphics and ugly textures

459
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,000
lighted areas too bright no lock on cheap deaths horrendous voice acting cumbersome

460
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,720
systems for casting spells which i might agree that is pretty bad camera angle too low to

461
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,800
the ground and invisible and visible barriers all over the place i don't know it just sounds

462
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,440
to me it's sloppy stuff well a giant brain is kind of cool you know because that's just

463
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,120
an enemy that you fight and the fact that it's a giant brain makes it easier to hit

464
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,120
with their crappy targeting system so i don't know it's okay i think is one of those games

465
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,680
though that probably shouldn't have been brought over here um for you know the full price maybe

466
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:42,840
well it was $49.99 so maybe $39.99 would have been a better price maybe like they have to

467
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,680
pay us to play it yeah maybe free would have been a better price maybe hey at least it

468
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,280
wasn't as bad as bomberman act zero that is one thing great they could put that on the

469
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,360
sticker a little sticker so you know okie from morrisons radio says hey it wasn't as

470
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:04,580
bad as bomberman act zero well i have something that should make everybody happy um in regards

471
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:12,760
to uh xbox live we have the uh classic teenage mutant ninja turtles game going to xbox live

472
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:20,940
and it's going to be um actually uh out um i believe the date was march 21st which is

473
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,600
right before the movie comes out on march 23rd guys isn't that speculation still because

474
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,640
they don't really ever know for sure what the dates are well yeah that's speculation

475
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,480
but i think that makes sense smart date certainly i know the game's coming out like the actual

476
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,680
tmnt game well um at any rate it's uh going to have two to four player co-op over xbox

477
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:50,600
live um nothing saying about enhanced modes um it's going to be uh 400 points um you know

478
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:58,000
that's uh looks like it's going to be really awesome um oh also you can still play it alone

479
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,560
and um it's like co-op if you want it i guess but it's still turtles dibs on leonardo dibs

480
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:13,560
on donatello for me all right well um you know i i want to address this real quick before

481
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,340
we get into our next segment but i noticed this coming up quite a bit in our chat i've

482
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,860
seen this like twice now the night and it's coming up again and the person who's posting

483
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,240
it has an ol army recruit number in front of them so i can't credit it but somebody

484
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,080
is spreading around this story about mushroom kingdom hearts coming to the nintendo we that

485
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,760
was a it's got to be fake right it's an april fool's joke that's what it is every year they

486
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,880
do an april fool's joke and it's april April fool's day so oh i see so they're the upcoming

487
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,440
april issue of electronic gaming monthly and they always do some stupid ass april fool's

488
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:50,120
thing all right i get it it's got to be a joke it's a joke it is a joke they even pointed

489
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:57,020
out that it's a joke yeah all right it's a nice idea but i don't i would like a new mario

490
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:04,280
rpg yeah but it's never a great idea i think that's why it makes a pretty decent joke but

491
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:11,120
uh no sorry guys not a reality yeah all right well um since jamie brought up teenage mutant

492
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,920
ninja turtles being confirmed for xbox live arcade and all we thought we'd take this opportunity

493
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,200
to play a little game here on the show that we have not played in a long long long time

494
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:29,740
so we're gonna play tonight listless here's the way listless works you guys we're gonna

495
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,940
come up with the definitive list around a certain topic and it's been brought to my

496
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,940
attention by a long time listener and staff of the show uh dark to see that we may have

497
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,480
actually done this topic once before but we've deemed uh since it's been at least a year

498
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,380
since we've done this topic and so much has changed we have a lot of new listeners since

499
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,380
the last time we're gonna go ahead and do listless for this topic tonight and the listless

500
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:57,480
would be teenage mutant ninja turtles was one of the most sought after games for the

501
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:04,720
xbox live marketplace right um so what arcade game now do people want to see on xbox live

502
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,000
arcade now that ninja turtles has made its way over what games should be next so this

503
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,900

508
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,520
leaving a list of eight games after that the chat room will vote on their favorites and

509
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,740

00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:51,760
like to see ported over to xbox live arcade so let's start it off uh who wants to start

511
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,000
off tonight i shall all right ladies first uh what would be your pick for the game you

512
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,120
would most like to see on xbox live marketplace arcade games number three right number three

513
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:12,120
r-type r-type the arcade r-type why arcade r-type because it's fucking r-type all right

514
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:19,920
loki won't be your number three pick the arcade version of bionic commando wow that's kind

515
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,780
of obscure how is the arcade version of bionic commando different from the nes for those

516
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:29,440
that don't know hopefully not by much i don't know better graphics i could just tell you

517
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,720
like i haven't played bionic commando in the arcade but i can tell you that like rygar

518
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,400
in the arcade and on the nes were completely freaking different all right uh mikkel top

519
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:46,360
why don't you go next your number three pick i would say um the x-men game the six person

520
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,920
yeah yeah that was a good game we talked about that last week here on the show the x-men

521
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:56,920
game that's a very good choice all right x-men my number three pick would be quiz and dragons

522
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:02,000
so i can take on bobby blackwolf with the xbox quiz and dragons was this game and it

523
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,680
had like i think they used pretty much the same engine that magic sword and all those

524
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:11,000
other games magic sword god okay um like it was capcom made right and basically you would

525
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,680
roll dice and go around the board and you would battle monsters like slimes and whatever

526
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:21,360
and you battled them by answering trivia questions nerd it was awesome but insanely hard so quiz

527
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:29,960
and dragons my number three pick uh dark soccer my number two is planet harrier why planet

528
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,520
harrier planet harrier has not had a home release of any kind and it was the sequel

529
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,800
to um space harrier which was a really freaking awesome game and i i've played planet harrier

530
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,680
in the arcade it's really really fun and i think that it deserves some sort of home release

531
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:55,040
all right uh what next loki what would be your number two pick um my number two pick

532
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:03,280
would be you know actually i would like to see the name i i see the image of the game

533
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:12,960
i'm just have to go with um you know the beyonce metal slug actually because why the hell not

534
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,200
i mean they're gonna put metal slugging everything rather have some achievements for it all right

535
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,000
metal i can't believe you of all people just said i went i drew more metal slug you obviously

536
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:34,320
you're drawing a blank all right uh miklata you're number two turtles in time turtles

537
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,400
in time the sequel all right sounds fair it was so much fun to like throw the foot soldiers

538
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,880
at the screen i think that's the one you do it in and like it was like you could do it

539
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,360
in the first one too okay i was originally this is a case where the chat room yelling

540
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,000
out random things can't have influence on this because i'm actually going to pick one

541
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,040
from chat for my number two because um i originally was gonna say rampart because that game was

542
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,440
pretty awesome rampart you don't ever play our key into it was like young it was it was

543
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,200
kind of tetrisy because you would rotate pieces to build a wall but they have it on playstation

544
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,220
three i don't see why they can't have it so i'll take it off since it's on i'm gonna say

545
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:18,340
i love this idea nba jam totally needs to be on xbox live they have the codes though

546
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,960
for the um mortal kombat character and that game was so that could totally work too because

547
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,280
uh midway puts a bunch of stuff on my i want nba jam fuck yeah i'm putting nba jam down

548

549
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,760

00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:50,200
gs68 for blazing star but um but no it's got to be it's got to be radiant silver gun all

551
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,720

on the plane because those are fun the hentai kicks thing i remember what it was called

556
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,920
though oh you should just say gals panic that's what it was gals panic will we allow loki

557
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,320
to remove metal slug and put in gals panic sure all right fine we will allow metal slug

558
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:37,120
to come off the list in favor of gals panic there you go gals panic that's the first time

559
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,480
we've ever done that on a listless segment by the way allowed that to get changed all

560
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,640
right um mikotov you looked a little pissed off when loki took simpsons the arcade game

561
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,680
did you come up with a new number one i'm trying so hard but like that's all the arcade

562
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,600
games i played shall we go to the chat rooms for some ideas let me look at them would you

563
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,680
like me to read them to you um i'm just i can't credit all these because a lot of folks

564
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:06,080
are just yelling them out uh super super off-road moonwalker arcade uh dungeons and dragons

565
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:15,880
shadows over misteria um can i pick a ticket game no you can't do a ticket game um no there's

566
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:23,180
this crazy climber um no there's this game that everybody without getting it was by midway

567
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,920
and it had it had like a joystick and trackball and it was like first person shooter or third

568
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,760
person shooter type the grid the grid yeah you want the grid yeah i want the grid all

569
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,480
right the grid we just talked about that earlier in the show where were you well i was drooling

570
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,360

571
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:47,960
want anything from starbucks i'm like they're going back all right uh my number one pick

572
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:54,040
would be super puzzle fighter 2 turbo because that game was awesome and especially with

573
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,240
dance puzzle jojo and why not because they have you know street fighter 2 up why not

574
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:05,480
give us puzzle fighter 2 probably because the joystick sucks that's funny because act

575
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,920
deaf said that again in chat but i actually had that written down before he said that

576
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,760
act deaf and i are on very similar wavelengths tonight apparently so there you have it here's

577
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:19,880
the list this is stands so far before the elimination part of this list we have arcade

578
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:29,160
r-type bionic commando x-men quiz and dragons planet harrier gals panic turtles in time

579
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:37,320
nba jam radiant silver gun simpsons the grid and super puzzle fighter 2 turbo which of

580
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:47,320
these games is not worthy of being on the list dark sakura the grid oh the grid gets

581
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,120
denied i'm not very fond of that game miklotov says you know what i pulled that out of my

582
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,680
ass anyway so i'm okay with that elimination loki which of these games does not deserve

583
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:05,080
to be on the list um you know i would actually say well nba jam just because there's no way

584
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,040
there would be i mean it'd be nice such a cock but they can't do it blame ea they have

585
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,240
the rights to the nba franchise for years and years and years well actually no they

586
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,840
do it's the nfl not the nba right oh you're right you're right my mistake so uh next yeah

587
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,920
fine it'll stay um radiant silver gun because there's gonna be already like ikaru and a

588
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:33,760
bunch of other shit coming to live okay silver gun is unique it's gone no one anymore please

589
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,920
okay no donut for you bye bye radiant silver gun nice knowing you all right and and it's

590
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,280
funny because chat room was like fuck you loki fuck you and then i retract that fuck

591
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:50,320
you uh miklotov which of these comes off the list oh yeah these have these which one of

592
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,020
these uh does not deserve to be on the list um quiz and dragons because it's too nerdy

593
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:00,240
for that list i kind of i kind of accepted the fact that quiz and dragons would come

594
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:07,120
off the list so i'm okay with that um and i will um help jamie out and take a little

595
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,740
revenge on loki but um not how you think i'm gonna take off bionic commando because come

596
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,160
on he couldn't even tell me what was different from the nes version the nes version has better

597
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,040
graphics that's it no the nes version is awesome it's like what's the difference between contra

598
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,480
and contra in the arcade it has better graphics that's it that's the only one you need all

599
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,960
right uh and now there's objections going on in chat room uh black wolf has just told

600
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:37,120
miklotov to go die in a fire uh let's see anyway um all right let's look at the list how it

601
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:44,240
stands now and you guys can vote you can vote for either arcade r-type x-men planet harrier

602
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:52,360
gals panic turtles in time nba jam simpsons or super puzzle fighter 2 turbo the way this

603
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,260
works is you're going to send your number one and your number two pick and a private

604
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,740
message to sky in our chat room only if you're listening live you send your number one and

605
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,700
your number two pick clearly labeled that helps us break any ties so there it is um

606
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:12,780
arcade r-type x-men planet harrier gals panic turtles in time nba jam simpsons super puzzle

607
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,720
fighter 2 turbo what arcade games should they port next to xbox live arcade we'll have the

608
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,800
results later in the show it'd be awesome oh good it's a good thing you said the x-men

609
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,480
game because the other game i would have mentioned was the uh avengers game because the avengers

610
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,940
game i've been like everybody knows i've been getting back into my whole obsession with

611
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:35,160
captain america and i love the avengers so i've been like actually downloading them we

612
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,920
we actually uh played that the other day the old game i was gonna say uh i don't think

613
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,560
they would put gals panic on live arcade because it's too pornographic for them it's a fun

614
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,600
game though they could do girls of xbox well they have was it they don't they have the

615
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:57,600
one that's not gals panic but it's like gals panic but in 3d that it's not nudity but it's

616
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,360
just you know scantily clad you know it's broth and pennies exactly the brawn panty

617
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,760

623
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,680
somewhere else i'll tell you offline because you're more than invited which i told you

624
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,760
about the stream beach volleyball olr extreme beach volleyball i think not if you want to

625
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,680
see me in a speedo you need help i played volleyball in high school did you yes i did

626
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,600
because um i don't know why the they would always make me the server because i was short

627
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:55,360
and i couldn't spike you played volleyball in high school okay wow did it but was it

628
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:01,840
sunny enough in kansas to actually play volleyball oh it was indoor volleyball all right i played

629
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:06,640
uh marching band that's that was my sport i was a marching band too and your book something

630
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,080
else i played a lot of in high school that i haven't played a lot of since is earthworm

631
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:16,800
gym and guess what dave perry the shiny entertainment founder has hinted uh that a new earthworm

632
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,360
gym game is going to quote happen eventually apparently they have put together the pieces

633
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:28,120
of the development team uh to revive this game that originally came out in 1994 you

634
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,520
might remember it was the game where you could like launch cows and i remember the burping

635
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,960
theme so i went earthworm gym like when you like somebody burped the title and they recorded

636
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,120
it because that's how mature earthworm gym was of a game i think it would be kind of

637
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,440
fun to see that come back why do i have a feeling this might be an xbox live arcade

638
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,960
title i don't does it does it does it scream xbox live to anyone else is it just me yeah

639
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:56,400
it does no we'll see so um they did didn't they do like a 3d remake of it or something

640
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,880
like that that came out on the psp you're thinking of bubsy i think no no i'm thinking

641
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,920
earth was a gym yeah i don't know there was like a quasi 3d remake or something somebody

642
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,960
i just yeah ew 3d earthworm gym the new earthworm gym better be 2d so apparently there was one

643
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:18,240
i just never played it i guess that's a good thing anyways so um well earthworm gym you

644
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,920
know it's a great game the question is how do you get your girlfriend to play games with

645
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,440
you speaking of which you have excellent timing there is a list that's been posted on the

646
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,960
internet how to get your girlfriend to play video games with you you put lots of naked

647
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,240
people in it you put things that she likes in it and not things you like in it i don't

648
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,540
know number one they say find out if your girlfriend has ever played video games she

649
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,960
may not be a full-blown gamer but she may have played mario games when she was younger

650
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,120
and she may play games on the internet and stuff like that um to remind your girlfriend

651
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,320
that if you both play games you'll be able to spend even more quality time together bullshit

652
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:04,440
um pick out games she might like if you're not 100 sure she'll enjoy it you can rent

653
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,880
it uh try to choose a game or system um that isn't too confusing and doesn't require short

654
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,560
reaction time because because girls are feeble-minded apparently that's what i was just thinking

655
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,360
oh because my female brain can't figure out these buttons well the voice you're hearing

656
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,960
by the way is loki's wife nelly oh i'm sorry hi i'm nelly that's right and i'm retarded

657
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,680
because i can't figure out buttons what do i do with this i don't know where does the

658
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,640
thingy go uh if you can get a game that is multiplayer optimally co-op and says consider

659
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,440
your girlfriend's personality when picking out a game some girls may prefer brightly

660
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:47,760
colored all ages games like katamari bust a move or lego star wars sims or any mario

661
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,520
game but remember if your girlfriend is an individual who could just as well go for halo

662
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,160
resident evil or grand theft auto or nelly's case dead or alive extreme beach volleyball

663
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,700
too don't get games that involve things like strippers prostitutes sex unless she has a

664
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:05,520
sense of humor about the subject well i yeah it's a good thing that they added the sense

665
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,240
of humor thing but i was about to disagree and it says have fun when you play with her

666
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:16,600
even if you make a good time she'll enjoy it even if she's not into games and yada yada

667
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:22,240
yada and basically um i don't know so they have a whole bunch of tips out there it's

668
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,960
on wikihow.com get your girlfriend to play video games if you're really interested in

669
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,880
i just say you know like nelly said make sure that there's porn in there or something or

670
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,200
incentives get rez with the trans vibrator there you go all right well every week on

671
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,240
this program dark sakura likes to surf the internet up and down and left and right and

672
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,640
back and forth uh whatever she the ddr steps are that she's dancing to this week will be

673
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,780
the world wide web surfing to find the website of the week to share with you all here on

674
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:59,040
orange lounge radio so dark sakura what is your website of the week um you picked it

675
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,760
out i helped you you asked for ideas i gave you ideas but it would have been one that

676
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,340
i would have used um it's potterpuppetpals.com which i think was down for a while but um

677
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:16,040
and really it's just you know the ones that came out in the actual puppet version um with

678
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:24,040
the sexy snape animation and uh the muggle pants animation and stuff like that so potterpuppetpals

679
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:34,100
it's snape let's bother him um is that just potterpuppetpals.com yeah all right my favorite

680
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:40,560
part of that is every time snake comes out and like i snake the potion master i was like

681
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:46,920
yeah all right that was a very brief website of the week that's what happens when i suggest

682
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,680
it then dark sakura doesn't have anything to say about it really all right well if you

683
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,720
want to talk about something cooler than potter puppet pals uh let's talk resistance fall man

684
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,760
it's getting updated soon it's gonna have um some brand new multiplayer content as well

685
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:08,880
as um some episodic content new modes and maps and whatnot so that's kind of cool and

686
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:14,880
apparently on march 23rd uh coinciding with the european launch they're going to launch

687
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,840
the two multiplayer modes which is team conversion uh basically the conversion mode with teams

688
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:26,840
and assault and where you destroy your team's defending base and they're also adding a spectator

689
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:33,400
camera mode as well and um later on we should be getting some more story elements um in

690
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,160
the form of episodic content so i'm glad to see that they're actually doing some stuff

691
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,840
with this game because it is pretty an awesome game it's just you know once you finish with

692
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:46,020
it i guess multiplayer is the only thing left for you like go back through the game get

693
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:51,800
some more weapons but that's about it fun though all righty well we're going to open

00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,960
beatmania 10th style now this is an import game right yeah it's an import game so i have

715
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,000
to use uh swap magic all right well tell it or you have to own a japanese playstation

716
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,400
too like i actually own one uh it has a lot of dust on it but i have one yeah well tell

717
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:15,760
us your review uh beatmania 10th style well it has my favorite song list in it and uh

718
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,280
i heard a lot of complaints about it on uh just some of the various bimani communities

719
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:29,080
but i didn't really see it i mean it was what were some of the complaints i don't know like

720
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:35,760
i just heard that it was bad just people going this sucks you can't ever you can't ever take

721
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,760
that for an answer though you can't let somebody go this sucks you got it why why does it suck

722
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:47,760
yeah the only thing that i ever heard about it that was legitimate was that it's where

723
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:53,640
the difficulty really started ramping up there are a few songs in there where the difficulty

724
00:52:53,640 --> 00:53:00,120
just starts getting a little intense but um overall i mean i think it has the best song

725
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:06,240
list out of uh the releases that i've played it does have a pretty solid song list i remember

726
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:13,240
that what uh what types of songs would bimani fans be uh happy to know or in the game well

727
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:20,760
um there was eggsy on by led light and there uh there was a lot of uh sampling masters

728
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,600
sampling masters was really heavy in there there was both rattle the mercury and rattle

729
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:34,280
the sun of some sampling masters is stuff 108 daddy daddy it was really it was a talk

730
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:40,320
heavy um mixed there was a lot of there's a lot of talk songs in there if i've never

731
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,360
played a beatmania 2dx game before in my life but i just happen to have you know a playstation

732
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,960
2 japanese or a swapper or whatever do you think the beatmania 2dx 10 style is a good

733
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:56,800
entry into the series for someone entry level it depends because i'm training somebody right

734
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,360
now and they seem to really like and be able to play a lot of them but if you've never

735
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:07,380
played before i'd say maybe this one's just a little too hard because after maybe the

736
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:14,280
first five songs the difficulty starts to ramp up a bit so maybe not ten style but ten

737
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,400
style would be an awesome second or third game all right well there you have it any

738
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:26,720
final thoughts for our listeners paradox vincent on uh comment on the uh getting girls to play

739
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:35,800
games segments actually um like some of the games that i found worked really good were

740
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:46,560
you know katamari and uh ddr actually but no rez rez didn't work rez doesn't work even

741
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:55,040
with the attachment huh even with the trans vibrator attachment well i don't know about

742
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:01,360
the trans vibrator attachment maybe you need to have her take a second look uh maybe all

743
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,360
right paradox vincent thanks so much for the call uh we appreciate it and have fun with

746
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,640

747
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:29,320
about how do we get girls into gaming they mean the casual gaming girl i think not the

748
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:33,880
hardcore gamer nerds you know like you and i regardless of sex you know and all that

749
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:39,160

that's really difficult is uh excuse me the thing that's really difficult in that game

761
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,680
is moving around and doing tricks um because they do it a lot differently than you would

762
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:53,360
with a dualshock 2 controller um once once you get accustomed to that though um as the

763
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,340
tutorial does a great job of get having you get the hang of it it's a lot of fun when

764
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:07,560
will ssx tricky come out an ssx blur when people don't give a shit about ao ratings

790
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:22,760
call here hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's legend azaku hi legend azaku

791
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:30,000
what's on your mind buddy um just just ranting on the internets in particular how people

792
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,080
are just bitching and moaning about you know how how the ps1 ps3 game unreal 2003 is actually

793
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:41,280
getting keyboard and mouse support i would like to see that as an itune review by the

794
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:48,880
way as an itunes review of this program that's just ranting on the internets yeah yeah sorry

795
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:54,320
go ahead as you know they're saying that it's going to give you know pc gamers who basically

796
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,240
grew up on keyboard mouse myself uh it's going to give them an advantage over the the folks

797
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:05,920
that use access just to play the game and there's just uh some back and forth arguing

798
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,920
well what do you think is it really that big a deal or should people just shut up about

799
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,360
it or what the only exceptions to con you know the only good controls that i've seen

800
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:21,760
so far you know in console first person shooters is golden eye and perfect dark that's it because

801
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,360
they had that they had the benefit of the you know the the joystick on the n64 and it

802
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:35,020
actually felt nice on your hands whereas you know stuff like halo honestly you know personally

803
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:40,360
i found it really hard to just you know to actually aim and i found that and i found

804
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,600
it very difficult with every other first person shooter that i've seen on the console it's

805
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:49,000
just it was just horrible but now that they had a keyboard and mouse i could pretty much

806
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,200
it's easier for me to transition this is you know but then on the other side you could

807
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:01,600
actually use six axis you know you know to aim to move the to move the aim you know to

808
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,480
move you know to basically aim up and down and then you can just use the t-pad to move

809
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,520
to move forward backwards side to side since you since you brought up halo you know there

810
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:15,720
are current existing 360 games that will use any usb keyboard final fantasy 11 is what

811
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:20,800
i'm thinking of right but the halo 3 ought to accept a mouse and a keyboard usb mouse

812
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:25,640
and usb keyboard as possible control devices just to throw the piece of gamers a bone at

813
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:31,000
least because you know they're still out there and that that would pretty much on getting

814
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:36,160
halo 3 if it had that i could just hook up a you know mouse and keyboard and then i could

815
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,960
just you know play at my in my own comfort zone without having to go through hell trying

816
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,440
to learn the controls and trying to be good at it hmm interesting all right well any other

817
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:52,840
thoughts for our listeners tonight um um tune pawns initial d that's all i have to say all

818
01:01:52,840 --> 01:02:01,080
right what's that what maximum two oh i thought you said you want to comment on initial d

819
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:06,880

820
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,880
the soundtrack i would agree oh yeah that too and the fact that it's more real than

821
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:17,200
than initial d all right well uh racing game fans if you uh disagree with zaku uh call

830
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:10,240
good radio rob way to go yeah he's just yeah way to go rob go to bathroom hi what a wuss

831
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:21,200
hello hi hey what's on your mind i got a question what i got a question for you i read an article

832
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:26,640
on consumers sometime back about people complaining about game stop the fact that they open up

833
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,400
all the video games and put it out on display and then when they sell them they sell them

834
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,600
at the full price they'd rather not knock a couple bucks off um what do you think about

835
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,440
that well first of all i have no affiliation with game shop whatsoever anymore

836
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:47,920
that's fine but honestly they don't do that with all of their games that's like the last

837
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:54,120
one and it hasn't been played the disc has not been physically touched on the thing it

838
01:03:54,120 --> 01:04:00,280
has not been inside of the system it is an unused game it is only that the case has been

839
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:06,800
opened correct you're right on that but i guess from my point of view from working retail

840
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:13,320
it seems like it belongs in box status where you won't still new it's open and technically

841
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,880
you really can't say it's new so you're not a couple of dollars off it's sort of like

842
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,560
a shade of gray when you think about it i think open box really should apply to uh like

843
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:28,600
hardware like appliances the same thing thinking with demos and shoes as well but i remember

844
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,920
i was with a friend of mine you know my friend patty we were looking for a game we found

845
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:38,200
it but they would not get a couple bucks or because it was open it was like a display

846
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:41,760
box you know they took the game out and all of that and the boxes are a little bit faded

847
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,540
i mean at least they could at least get stumped well i think that um well okay look at it

848
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:50,820
this way um if ever you go to the bookstore and you have books that are shrink wrapped

849
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,560
you know but you have books that are unwrapped they're still going to sell you the book at

850
01:04:54,560 --> 01:05:00,480
the same at the same price unless the book itself is damaged if the game is not damaged

851
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:06,920
If the case is not damaged, then there's no reason for them to make any differentiation

852
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,920
between it.

853
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,480
You're right, but it's just that some people argue about that.

854
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,880
I mean, that's one of the reasons I try not to shop at GameStop unless I really have to,

855
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,880
you know?

856
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,880
Well, I don't shop at GameStop anymore at all, so don't blame me there.

857
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,880
Go to GameCrazy.

858
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,640
There's no GameCrazies out here in New York, not that I know of.

859
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,960
They should be attached to a Hollywood video, if you got them.

860
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,480
We have a Hollywood video, but there is no GameCrazies there.

861
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:38,480
That's sad.

862
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,480
Around here in New York City, you have the local shop, Best Buy, Cirque du Sole, if you

863
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,040
like me, there's a GameCrazy store.

864
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,280
Well, GameCrazy sells old games, and that's why I love them.

865
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,160
Not just because Dan Mina works there.

866
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,240
Well, it works for me, definitely.

867
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,880
All right, well, it sounds...

868
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:57,120
Is there anything else, Rama?

869
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,720
I want to call you out, Skye.

870
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,400
I'm tired of you talking trash about Vista.

871
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,400
I don't...

872
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,400
I'm tired of it.

873
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,760
I'm not really talking a lot of trash about Vista.

874
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,880
I'm just not that interested in it.

875
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,720
Yeah, but the thing is, there's no Windows XP.

876
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,480
Every popular XP coming out, oh, new upgrades, brand new hardware.

877
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:19,720
By the time the new OS came out, it's definitely time to upgrade, because it's been like maybe

878
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,840
two or three years since the last upgrade.

879
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:27,080
Since it was Vista, it's been a while since, you know, the last operating system was with

880
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,080
XP.

881
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:32,400
We got newer hardware for Vista to support, and people complain about bugs left and right.

882
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,880
A lot of those bugs do not even apply unless you're like a hardcore, higher-end user doing

883
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,160
stuff you shouldn't even be doing.

884
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,160
Why should I upgrade to Vista?

885
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:47,920
Well, personally, because if there are newer hardware that's coming out that XP may not

886
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:54,320
be able to support, and the fact that XP and Vista is more secure, is more stable, I've

887
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:55,320
been...

888
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,800
But that's Microsoft being a cunt about it.

889
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:02,400
I mean, seriously, because the new hardware doesn't have to lock out XP.

890
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:09,560
So besides the fact that, you know, I'm not going to have much choice to upgrade to Vista,

891
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,320
why do I need to upgrade to Vista now?

892
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:18,440
Well, to be perfectly honest, I can't say now, because if that was the case, I'd worry

893
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,440
I'd update it.

894
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,120
Drew and I, he's already updated.

895
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:26,000
I'm waiting a month before I get all my hardware upgrade ready to go, because I want to really

896
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,840
try out this copy that's out in stores, because I shouldn't be really famous, but I was a

897
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:35,280
beta tester, and I've been playing around with it since it was Lobo, and I've seen the

898
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,280
changes from like 2004 all the way up to now.

899
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,520
Ram, I've got to be honest, you're not selling it to me.

900
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:46,240
I mean, you're telling me that because everyone else is doing it, I should do it?

901
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,840
I'm doing the best that I can.

902
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,080
I work retail, you know?

903
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,080
I know, you don't work retail.

904
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,080
I'm going to be perfectly honest.

905
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:56,200
Look, let me tell you straight up, honestly, if you don't want to upgrade to Vista, that's

906
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,200
fine.

907
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,560
I mean, to each his own.

908
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:01,440
Me personally, I plan on doing the upgrade in due time.

909
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,280
XP is still going to be around for a couple of years.

910
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:08,240
The only time Microsoft is really going to force everyone to upgrade to Vista is when

911
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,800
they say, oh, we're no longer supporting Windows XP.

912
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,800
All right.

913
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,160
I'm going to read some chat comments on this and then wrap up here.

914
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:18,040
I see James Patrick says, you can control audio for every separate program in Vista.

915
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,920
I'm trying to help you out there with some good reasons.

916
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:21,920
Let's see.

917
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,920
What was it?

918
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,520
Somebody has said they are on Windows.

919
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,760
Oh, NM64 says, Vista, heck, I still prefer Windows 2000.

920
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,760
There you go.

921
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:30,760
All right.

922
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,560
Well, Ram, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.

923
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,480
Any last words for our listeners?

924
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,760
Listen to uni's radio or shout cat.

925
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,600
I don't remember the name of it, but she should be posting in the chat room.

926
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,600
All right.

927
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,000
I'm sure she appreciates the plug.

928
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Take care.

929
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
No problem.

930
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Bye.

931
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
But don't listen to it right now, because we're on the air.

932
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
All right.

933
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Take care.

934
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
All right.

935
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,840
Thanks so much for the call, and we're going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line now.

936
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,960
Thank you so much to those of you that got through tonight and participated in the show.

937
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,520
We appreciate it as always.

938
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:08,280
I'm going to go around and ask if there's any last minute stories, dark soccer, anything?

939
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:15,480
Not particularly, just I'd like to remind everybody that I'm really awesome, and okay.

940
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,480
That's not a story.

941
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,680
Loki.

942
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:22,360
There was a thing that's coming out in Japan that's actually kind of funny.

943
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:28,160
It's a painting program for the DS, and you basically paint like those paint by number

944
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:34,000
things, but for the DS, so it's like a coloring book.

945
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,320
Sounds kind of interesting.

946
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,320
Not really.

947
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,320
Yeah.

948
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:39,320
Not really.

949
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:44,120
I got to send an interesting last minute story here.

950
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:48,280
This was sent to me via email by Brad from PodCulture.net.

951
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,600
Let's see.

952
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:58,840
A Japanese man has blamed his six axis for a new impotence problem.

953
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:04,600
Mr. Aoi Bailey says he cannot get an erection anymore.

954
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,880
He says having his controller in his lap in close proximity to his penis has left him

955
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,280
unable to perform.

956
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:14,000
He thinks the controller is sending out a Bluetooth frequency that can cause bodily

957
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
harm.

958
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,720
He has contacted Sony to find out if he's not the only one having problem from the PlayStation

959
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,720
3 controller, but has yet to get a response.

960
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,920
Bailey plans on going to the doctor this week to try to get some answers.

961
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:29,960
So Bluetooth gives you impotence apparently.

962
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,840
What the hell is this?

963
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,360
I think he just has emotional problems, and that's why he's impotent.

964
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,520
Why is he trying to play the game with his penis anyway?

965
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:41,680
It sounds like he's trying to put the controller right there to maybe look at a picture of

966
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,680
a pretty girl.

967
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:45,800
I don't know about you, but when I play the game, I don't have my hand down there.

968
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,560
I have the controller in my hands.

969
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,520
That's the Al Bundy way of playing video games.

970
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,560
One hand down your pants, there you go.

971
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:58,400
That's awfully lazy, and to be honest, I don't see that.

972
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,060
That's stupid.

973
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,160
How old is this guy?

974
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,160
It didn't say.

975
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,640
Yeah, that's what I thought.

976
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,640
I'm betting it's not anything that has to do with...

977
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,000
Well, here's what it is.

978
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,840
It's because the fucking imagery from the PlayStation 3 is so fucking sexy, his wife

979
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,800
just doesn't do it for him anymore.

980
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:22,500
Nintendo Maniac 64 wants to know, why would you put the six axis on your dick?

981
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,720
There's no rumble.

982
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:28,520
I guess that's a good question to ask.

983
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,640
One of the OL Army recruits, meaning they haven't changed their nickname yet, says,

984
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,800
that's how the power glove was invented.

985
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,200
Now you're playing with power.

986
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,200
That's so bad.

987
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:43,980
All right, well, let's go around, if there's no more last minute stories, and get everybody's

988
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:44,980
final thought.

989
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:46,680
We'll start with you tonight, Dark Sakura.

990
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,640
What's your final thought?

991
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,840
Give me money.

992
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,040
My final thought is Guinness.

993
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,800
That's my final thought, because I've had like three glasses of it this week.

994
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:57,800
It's good stuff.

995
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,920
Loki, your final thought, please.

996
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:07,080
My final thought is, it's a lot harder to put PlayStation 1 games on your PSP.

997
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,720
Were you successful in your attempts?

998
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:13,800
I put it on there, but the thing is, you need to have a bunch of different files from Hot

999
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:19,960
Shots 2, actually from the PlayStation Store, and then, because with each firmware update,

1000
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:25,880
they change the encoding on the PS1 games, so say, for example, you find a game you like

1001
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:30,280
online that someone's already converted over, it will only work for one type of the custom

1002
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:35,600
firmware, which I don't have that type, so it's a pain in the ass.

1003
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,600
All right.

1004
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,240
Well, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

1005
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,240
You guys are awesome.

1006
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,840
Remember, we do this for free for you guys, so if you like what you hear, please tell

1007
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,620
two friends about Orange Lounge Radio, because that way, if you tell two friends, then they

1008
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:50,600
tell two friends, and so on and so on.

1009
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,140
We slowly take over the world.

1010
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:53,140
That's how it works.

1011
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:56,800
That's how we get our name out there, because we don't have any big corporate magazine or

1012
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,760
game company or website that backs us.

1013
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,920
We're just us, free gamers like you guys.

1014
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,000
Thanks so much to our chat room for joining us tonight, and thanks so much to all our

1015
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
callers tonight.

1016
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Have a great week.

1017
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
We'll see you next week.

1018
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Are you going to be here, Darksara?

1019
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I know you had a week off coming up.

1020
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,080
Are you here next week?

1021
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:12,440
I don't know.

1022
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,600
There's some week you had off.

1023
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,320
I don't remember if it was this week or next, but hopefully, we will all be here next week,

1024
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,560
but if not, then some of us will see you here next week on Orange Lounge Radio.

1025
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:22,560
Take care.

1026
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,560
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
