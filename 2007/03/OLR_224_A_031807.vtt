Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, March 18th, 2007

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
All next-gen systems are set to roll up

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
A beautiful Katamari

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Halo 3 is set to arrive in September

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
But on what day?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And what happens when two popular dance games get together and have a baby?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello everyone out there on the internet

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Yo

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
And also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Hi

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Alright, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
We'd like to welcome you to our little program

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
DarkSakura, Loki and I all met a few years ago at an arcade

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
And decided, hey let's start a radio show talking about games

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
And we've been doing this internet program for the past almost five years

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
It'll be five years in June

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Talking about for a while music-based video games

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
And a couple years ago expanding into podcasting

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
And talking about a general variety of games

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
We're going to deviate from our usual forum a little bit

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Usually we start off the show talking about how is your gaming week

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
But tonight, we want to get right into this

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
Because we think this might be possibly what might draw some new people to our site this week

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Is this particular story

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
I'm going to cite a particular story of this site

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
QJ.net ran this story

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
So let's take a look, shall we?

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
Rumor, release dates for beautiful Katamari for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Before we go any further, we'll take this moment to warn everyone

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
That this particular topic is currently marked with a huge red rumor flag

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
This is a report about something that has somehow made the internet implode

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
But until we get any official word from Namco Bandai about the whole issue

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
We suggest taking the following details with a grain of salt

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Okay, good

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Blah, blah, blah, there's reports going around about beautiful Katamari

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Blah, blah, blah, it's going to come out on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
October 17, 2007 for $39.99

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
On the Wii, November 14, 2007 for $29.99

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
The report goes on to say that the PlayStation 3 version will feature 6-axis support

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Though fails to elaborate on how exactly this will be implemented

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
And also points out that the release dates they gave actually coincide with a trademark

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Namco Bandai filed back in January

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
A screenshot has said trademark has been provided as proof

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Now as much as we want to start doing cartwheels of joy over this piece of news

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
There are several things we need to keep in mind

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
At the moment, the only source of these reports seem to be Orange Lounge Radio

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Who are they? I've never heard of them

02:41.000 --> 02:46.000
There's this really annoying guy and then this other really annoying guy and then this really awesome girl on it

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
A bunch of liars is who they are, they're a bunch of damn dirty liars

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Although they must have some pretty solid reasons on how they came up with this bit of news

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Skeptics can say that there are still some gaps that need to be filled in

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
We all have yet to receive official word from Namco Bandai

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Which either confirms or denies the existence of beautiful Katamari

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Trademarks get filed almost every day

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
But that doesn't necessarily mean that they actually get used

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
I don't know, they're really poking some holes in this theory here

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
This is something else

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
The team behind Katamari has already been disbanded

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
And as far as everyone knows, no sequels were planned

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Although Katamari trademarks were registered towards the end of 2006

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Well we just so happen to have the man who started this whole thing right here in studio tonight

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Loki, you goddamn liar

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Is this some type of April Fools joke you're playing on all of us?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
No

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Is that what it is?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
No

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Tell me Knights is coming to the Wii? What the hell?

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
That's not my story

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Alright, no

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Seriously though, it wasn't just Katamari

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
In fact, we have the whole lineup for Namco

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Which we'll be revealing a little later in the show

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
So it's not just Katamari

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I got excited by Katamari because I love the game

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
So I figured, share the story with everyone

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
That and I gotta get a jump on those big corporate sites

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Because, you know, they like to beat everybody to stuff

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Anyways, so

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Beautiful Katamari

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It is set for this fall

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
The Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Are set for October 17th

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
$39.99, which is great

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
You know, nice price point for a game like that

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
And if you remember, the original Katamari

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Also very inexpensive

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
And then of course the Wii version is coming in November

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
And that's also $29.99

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Now, we do have a big time span between now and the fall

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
So, I can confirm this much

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Okay, the game is coming out

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
That is for sure

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Whether Namco decides to release it on those exact dates

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Because, you know, dates change a lot

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
You know, especially with six months gaps in between them

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
I would say that yeah, it's gonna come around the fall for sure

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Those exact dates, who knows

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
But those are street dates, not ship dates

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Ship dates are a day before

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Because, you know, most retailers out there

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
And most distributors out there

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
They work on street date systems

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
As opposed to ship dates

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
As, you know, most publishers work on

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
So

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Let's say that someone's listening to this show for the first time

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Because they want to hear what a bunch of liars we really are

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Why should anyone believe you?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Tell me, tell us

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
How you got, tell us what happened Friday morning

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
What took us from you finding out about this

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
And how you found out about it too

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Posting it on the site and so on

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, I do a lot of work on order forms and stuff for my company

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm a, you know, I work at a game distributor

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
One of the big ones in the United States

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
And so, because I work on this show as well

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
And because I'm, you know, a huge freak

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
When it comes to making sure I have accurate dates

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
And all my, you know, order forms and stuff

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
I check our system for new stuff

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Almost twice daily, if not more

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Because I'm crazy like that

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
And so, I will look and see if there's new stuff

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Especially next gen stuff all the time

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
And when I saw, you know

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Actually, I think the first title I did see was

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Ace Combat 6

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Which we'll be talking about later

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
I saw that and the system was like

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Hey, that's kind of neat, new game

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
So I, you know, said

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Okay, well probably got some Namco title downloads

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
And sure enough, pulled up

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Oh, there's Katamari

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
So I was like, okay, I gotta let people know this

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Because I was literally like jumping up and down in my seat

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
You know, when I saw this

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
But anyways, as far as how I get these dates

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
These dates are actually straight from the publishers

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Usually their sales department, purchasing department

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Wherever you may call it

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Are they secret?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Are you breaking an NDA by posting these?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Can you get fired?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Can we get sued?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
No, no, there's no

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
This is public information

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Any one of our, you know, customers

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Has access to this information

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I'm assuming that most of them probably

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Don't, you know, work in internet radio as well

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
But at the same time, I mean, you see this stuff all the time

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Also on like, you know, GameStop or Amazon

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Or something like that

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
They get title downloads as well

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Sometimes, you know, GameStop and stuff like that

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
They'll put in arbitrary, you know, titles or dates

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Or whatever, you know, for preorders

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
But since we don't really work on a preorder system

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
We don't have anything like that

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
We pretty much, if they give us, you know, the information

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
To set up an item

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
We will set it up in our system

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
And with whatever information they give us

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Well, interestingly enough

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
One thing that we observed is that almost at the same time

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
And I don't know who posted it first

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
You, these guys, but this other site

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
Xbox IC had some guy renegade with a cell phone camera

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
At a blockbuster who took screenshots in their system

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Also of Ace Combat and beautiful Katamari

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
And so it was very weird because, you know, we don't talk to that site

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
They don't talk to us

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
But yet we posted almost very similar stories

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
At the exact same time

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
It's very interesting

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
And if you look at their dates on there

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Their dates are all Friday dates

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Whereas ours are all Wednesday dates

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
Wednesdays are typically when, you know, most companies get their games released

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Of course games come out every single day of the week

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
But for the most part it's usually Wednesdays, Thursdays or Tuesdays

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Usually in the middle of the week

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
Now blockbusters, they're one of two things

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
They're either gonna, most likely they're gonna be

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Not direct with a publisher

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
So for Blockbuster

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
They would be getting their product received into the distributor

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Or their corporate office or wherever

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
And shipped out to the store

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Usually about two days ground or whatnot

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
That's why they have Friday street dates in there instead of Wednesdays

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
It just, you know, makes the system nice and neat and stuff

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
So, yeah

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
That's basically how we come about most of our street, you know, street dates and stuff like that

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
It's from actual sources at these companies

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
The problem is though their marketing departments

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
And the sales departments don't always talk to each other

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
And so in the case of like, you know, Konami last year

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
When we released all the information about their E3 lineup

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
They apparently didn't really want that information to be, you know, leaked out

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
But unfortunately somebody in their sales department went and did that

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
But, you know, that's life

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
That was a very interesting thing

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Because, you know, we have friends that work at Konami

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Several friends work at Konami

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And they almost got a little heat

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Because Konami thought they blapped

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And that isn't the case

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
It was this whole roundabout thing that went on

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Which was very interesting last year when that all went down

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah

09:20.000 --> 09:26.000
Now you say that this news, you know, the dates could change

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
The prices could change

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
And a lot of websites who've been blocking about this

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Have been kind of saying that

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Wow, this is really ballsy of them to post some dates and some dollar amounts

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
When it's so far out of advance

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
But you're kind of admitting that that could change

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
If it changes, it won't be by much

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
I mean, usually, you know, Namco as far as I'm familiar with

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
They don't really change dates too much

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
As far as stuff releasing

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
You know, some companies, for example, some of the smaller ones

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
You know, there's titles they'll move each month

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
And, you know, we'll see a date change like six or seven times

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
You know, some companies are a little bit better by that

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
When they put a street date in the system

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
They'll actually stick to that

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
You know, Rockstar with Grand Theft Auto IV

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
That's been October 17th since it's been announced

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
But I think about Bethesda and Oblivion

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
And that date always falls back

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah, exactly

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And it can be, you know, a couple things

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
They can be trying to postpone it to a later date because it's not done

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
Or because they want to time it with, you know, certain releases or lack of releases

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
You know, it's really up to the company

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
But I, you know, I don't really kind of

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
If that were the case and if I was always afraid of dates changing

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Then I'd never be telling you guys news

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
But the reason is you, I mean, even if the date changes

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
That's, you know, whatever

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
But the fact is this game is coming out

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
Next question I'm going to ask you

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, and I think of

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
Let's think of some cases on this program where this was correct

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And you named games through the distribution system

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
People didn't have yet that ended up coming out

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
We may not have blogged about them on the site

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Because we don't have the resources to have people

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Crawling blog sites 24 hours a day, 7 days a week

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
And the distribution thing and the way the other sites do it

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
We don't, we have day jobs

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
We do this for fun in the evening, you know

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Like Logie said, his day job is distribution

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
So we don't have the resources to blog about it

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
And have it, you know, in writing that we were the first every time

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
And the fact is sometimes, you know, like I said

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
The marketing departments and sales departments of these companies

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Don't always work together

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Some of them do, like for example Nintendo

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
They know not to say anything about anything

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
And even when you feed them a lot of alcohol

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
They still will not say anything

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
But yet I seem to recall that you were the only one

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
That was willing to say that the Wii was going to come out

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
After the PlayStation 3

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Because at some point earlier in the year

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Nintendo had said, no, we're going to beat the PlayStation 3

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
And they didn't, remember the Wii came out a little bit later

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
And you called that, I remember that distinctly

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Not that I'm trying to inflate our own ego here

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
You know, it's not a big deal, honestly

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
But it just, I don't know

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
For me, I get a little bit frustrated when I see all these website headlines

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
And say, rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Yet when EB Games and GameStop will post dates

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
They'll block it with, EB Games says this is going to come out

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
And they don't say it's a rumor

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
Why couldn't this have been blocked saying, distribution leak says, blah, blah, blah

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Why does that have to be rumor, rumor, rumor?

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
Well it's because, you know, our website doesn't have the word game

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
In it or a company name like Nintendo or something like that

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
And that's why

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
For example though, I mean, look at the Konami releases and stuff

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Or for example, I think someone, I can't remember if you did this or not in the story

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
But the whole Wired article saying, Karaoke Revolution, American Idol

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
All these guys are a bunch of liars

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
And this thing is never coming out

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
And then it comes out

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Do we see, you know, a story run later?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Oh, they were right, no

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Everybody forgets that we mentioned it

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And once, you know, a big site runs the press release

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Then everybody forgets that we even mentioned anything

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
And this is how it's happened in the past

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I mean, full out of two on the PSP

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I kept seeing this weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks after each other

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
But no one remembered when, you know, was it one up ran the fucking press release

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Or ran the story that's coming out

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
I was like, oh look, it's coming out on the PSP now

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
The other one I think of is Oblivion on the PSP

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Because when you first said that on the show

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
I was like, what? How the hell are they going to do Oblivion on the PSP?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
But sure enough, we find out later on

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
A scaled down dungeon only version

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
And you know, sometimes they'll release press releases

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
About game announcements before sales will find out

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
Like I said, it all depends on, you know, what the marketing department wants to do

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And what the sales department wants to do

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
The sales department wants to make sure that the retailers and distribution
