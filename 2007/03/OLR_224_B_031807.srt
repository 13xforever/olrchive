00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It is March 18, 2007, and you're on Part B of our podcast.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Remember, we tape Orange Lounge Radio in two halves every week.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you're listening to us on the podcast or audio blog feed and you haven't yet heard Part A,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
you really should go back into iTunes or Podcast Alley or Yahoo Podcast, Dig Podcast,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
whatever you use to listen to this program.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You should go back and grab Part A because it's really great.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Loki goes and tells us about the beautiful Katamari controversy you could say around the internet.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He gives us the definitive date for Halo 3 in September, as he's heard,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and gives us a whole lot of other release date stuff in Part A.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So check that out.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Not that I'm saying you shouldn't listen to this half of the show, too,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
because we have some good stories for you in this half, right?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Because we missed so much stuff in the first half of the program.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We do tape live on Sunday nights at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Join us sometime, shall we?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
All right, let's get into some of that news I was talking about.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay, so anyway, one thing that's been going around, it's kind of a rumor right now.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Best Buy, there has been a shot from Best Buy's system, their POS system,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and it's basically, well, it's a printout, I should say, from their computer system,

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
showing the status of the 20GB model of the PS3 is discontinued.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And a lot of people have been saying, or actually Sony has been saying,

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
that it's because it's a choice for retailers, what systems they bring in,

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and that's why I haven't been able to find 20GB systems.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now, here's an interesting spin on it, though.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Our company, we haven't been able to get 20GB systems for a while now,

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and they basically have been discontinued in our system as well,

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and this has been, I think, going on for about over a month.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So I wouldn't be surprised if this is true, if they're discontinuing the 20GB system,

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
probably because they're making more money off the 60GB system,

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and not a lot of people were snatching up the 20GB system.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't know, I think 20GB was still pretty fine.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I mean, 20 is enough space for right now, at least, so I don't know.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Not for the Xbox 360 with all that movie stuff.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm almost out of space, so I don't know.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think about that with the PlayStation 3.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
When I jump ship, I probably will get the 60GB model just because I'm a consumer whore.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And how?

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will just upgrade my hard drive in there.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, here's something cool.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Speaking of, we had talked about Tecmo earlier.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Tecmo is bringing out Ninja Gaiden Sigma.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It has new backgrounds, enemies, characters, animations, textures,

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
completely revamped for the next system.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You can partially or fully install the game on the PS3 to help with load time.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It will run at 60 frames per second, self-shadowing, and in 720p.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So lots of Ninja Gaiden action.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You also get a playable Rachel.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Apparently, she's supposed to be very bouncy because it's Team Ninja.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My question is will I actually be able to get anywhere in the game

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
without getting frustrated so that I throw my controller through the screen?

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Nobody can help that you suck at it, Rob.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No, everybody sucks at Ninja Gaiden.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a fucking hard game.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Dan was doing pretty good at it.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, Dan is a god among men then, I guess.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know what to tell you.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, I only marry awesome.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All right.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Anyhow, a game I'm really looking forward to on the PlayStation 3,

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and how sad is it that this is one of the games I'm really looking forward to

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
on the PlayStation 3?

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Loki's wagging his finger already because he knows what I'm going to say.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Sing Star on the PlayStation 3 is coming out, of course.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
A lot of people thought it was going to be something that was

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
like a network download, but no, I think at E3 they said it was going to be a full game.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, it is coming on a Blu-ray disc, and there's going to be HD videos on it,

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
30 songs on the disc.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We don't know exactly what 30 songs we're talking about yet,

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
but I seem to remember at E3 last year,

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
they demoed Survivor by Destiny's Child as one of the songs.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Am I on crack?

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wasn't there a Fallout boys song?

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Wasn't Dance Dance one of them too?

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I could be wrong, but if you saw them at E3,

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
chances are those licenses have carried over.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We'll see.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Regardless, I will make it my life mission to, on game 3.0 or whatever they call it,

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I will make it my mission to get Loki YouTubed singing something.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Maybe Survivor would be a good song for Loki,

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
but we'll get that on the Internet for all our listeners to download.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Or just Bobby Black Wolf because he's Loki's only friend on the PlayStation 3.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't know.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No, I'm not.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry, you have like seven friends now.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm not his only friend.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh, sorry.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He's not my only friend.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're very popular.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Exactly.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Anyways, something that's kind of popular on the PC is distributed computing.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They have a similar thing with folding at home as well as SETI at home, that type of stuff.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, I think they even talked about this back a long time ago

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
when they were talking about the cell processor.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now you can actually, with the new firmware update 1.6,

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
they'll be downloading folding at home as well.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's a funky little screensaver that helps process stuff to cure cancer.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So you might have a part in curing diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis,

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and many cancers and stuff like that.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let me write that $600 check right now.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's for a good cause, right?

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Exactly.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You know, I don't know.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's interesting, that whole distributed, I think that website distributed net had something like that.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's a very interesting concept.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't know as it is.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The PlayStation 3 does suck a lot of power out of it.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I mean, if this was something on the Wii, I can have it in standby and it would do this.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There's Wii Connect 24 for you, huh?

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know if I really want my PlayStation 3 with this giant screensaver on HDTV

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
just sitting there all day long, even if it was for a good cause.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Fuck that shit.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It should be calculating what the winning lotto numbers are for me.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's the kind of computing I want to see the PlayStation 3 doing.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I want it to see it earning money to pay for itself.

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's what it should be doing.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Go out and get a job, PlayStation 3.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Go out and watch some dishes somewhere.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Get a job cooking French fries someplace.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Work the streets if you have to.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't care.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Just help me pay the rent, PlayStation 3.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Pimp that Blu-ray.

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
$600, make you holla.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Anyway.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, make you holla.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Why did I spend $600 on this goddamn Blu-ray player?

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Anyway.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, in other news regarding the player itself,

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the 1.6 firmware update for PS3 has a remote play function,

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:39,000
so you can bring up any audio, video, photo stored on the PS3 using your PSP.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Actually, just anywhere you can find an internet connection.

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So that's kind of cool.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Mighty porn, mighty porn.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Sorry, anytime you talk about sharing photos and movies and all that stuff,

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't help but think of porn.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Is that so wrong?

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I also can't help but think of Killzone on the PlayStation 3 coming out in July.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Actually, there's a lot of other things I can think of.

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I just needed to transition.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What?

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, go ahead.

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, anyway.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Phil Harrison revealed some footage of Killzone on the PlayStation 3,

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
of course, at Game Developers Conference.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I guess one of those things where the feedback from the journalist was not so hot,

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
so they didn't end up showing it at the full Sony conference,

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
even though folks were reporting they could see it on the screen,

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
like in the PS3, they didn't play it.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It was a tease thing.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But according to IGN, the game will, I guess, come out in July.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's not coming out in July.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The demo will come out in July.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Interesting.

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah, the game itself is nowhere near done.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But we'll probably see it at E3 or something like that.

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Interesting.

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Another game that we can be looking forward to pretty soon,

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
well, a few months off at least, but Grand Theft Auto IV.

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And it is thought, the rumor is that it's going to be set in a New York City setting.

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And this rumor comes from a couple of people that have been contracted

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
to come up with New York City themed music for the game.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So, you know, possibly hinting at a New York City type theme.

170
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If I were to guess, I would say Liberty City,

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
because that's supposed to be New York City anyways.

172
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So, I don't know.

173
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I would think Liberty City all over again is where it's going to be.

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But whatever, they could surprise us and have a real city in there.

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Either way, the game's not expected out until October.

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
However, the first ever trailer of the game will be available March 29th.

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And I cannot wait.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And it better not suck.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the previous Grand Theft Auto game,

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you could fly planes at some point, right?

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay. Now, isn't putting the thing in New York City,

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
look, I'm trying not to be wrong here, but just thinking aloud here,

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
by putting Grand Theft Auto in a town very similar to New York City,

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
doesn't that kind of open it up for folks at home

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
to do some really unpolitically correct things in their game?

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Y'all know what I'm talking about. I don't have to say it.

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But you know kids across America are going to try to imitate it.

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You know, you can already, to be honest with you,

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
you can't fly 747s or whatever.

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You can't fly giant jet planes.

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can fly biplanes and stuff like that into towers

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
or jets and stuff like that.

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Hell, if you want to do that now, go buy San Andreas

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
because you can do that right now.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
San Andreas was funny because you'd be driving along on a motorcycle

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and a plane would crash into you.

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Random plane crashes are kind of fun in that game, too.

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Either way, it's going to be awesome.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This game is going to sell crazy,

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and people are going to get their panties in a bunch

202
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
because it's uber violent.

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I wouldn't have it any other way.

204
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's why I bring this up.

205
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
DarkShy and Shadowcourse, Rob, you're horrible.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's why I bring this up because if you're able to do that in the game,

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
somebody's going to sue over it.

208
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Johnson is going to have his ego all over this crap with another lawsuit.

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let me put it this way.

210
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If I can have Sex with the Hooker in a jet,

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
flying towards a building,

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and then set a nuclear explosion off that wipes out the entire city,

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
that would be awesome.

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Everybody seems to agree here that it's going to take place in the future.

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
A, it's not really New York City.

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
B, even if it was modeled after New York City a lot,

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
it would be a future New York City

218
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
where that landmark I was previously referring to would be removed.

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But still, I don't know.

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can't help but think they might put something in there

221
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
where folks should be able to make it look like that.

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
All that would happen is you'd crash into the building

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and your plane explodes.

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The building does not explode or fall apart.

225
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's all that would happen is you're planning to explode

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and be like, huh, it's like 9-11.

227
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And then you'd get it out of your system

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and you'd go back to playing the damn game.

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Or you'd be like me and do it a few more times

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
until you got it out of your system.

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But can you not see Tack Jomson in a courtroom

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
playing this footage, telling the judge how Rockstar is evil

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and they're Al-Qaeda sympathizers

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and the game should be banned from the market forever?

235
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No, no, no. Hold on, hold on.

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're expecting him to actually show footage of the game.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I mean, he's trying to sue them now

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
about games that haven't even come out yet

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
that he doesn't know anything about

240
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
other than that they are making a game.

241
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He's an idiot.

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay, that's it. We're not talking about him anymore.

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Not done.

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He who shall not be named.

245
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's not even refer to him. Just done. We're done.

246
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Because there's stories about him this week I'm not talking about.

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Didn't we say we were going to do that like a year ago?

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What?

249
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And we're done. Done. Stop.

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We've already said too much.

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Now I keep going to see if Loki's head explodes.

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, you know what we should do for our foe, our nemesis?

253
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We should send him one of the pink PS2s

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that are out in Australia on the 15th.

255
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Do you mean over at...

256
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I had to censor myself.

257
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Is that what you mean by arch nemesis?

258
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No, I was actually...

259
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, he's not necessarily an arch nemesis.

260
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
He's more like a lackey.

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He would be like Toad is to Magneto.

262
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay.

263
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No, I was referring to he who shall not be named.

264
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But I think a pink PS2 would just be the perfect thing

265
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
to cheer him up and get that stick out of his ass.

266
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But anyway, the pink pinky pink pink pink PlayStation 2

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
is in Australia as of March 15th.

268
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And it's pink.

269
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's everything you lived with the PS2.

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Dude, I want the Sakura PS2 because it's like sort of purple and shiny.

271
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Anyway.

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I swear to God I am sick and tired of hearing about Warhawk

273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and whether it's going to be on a fucking disc

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
or downloadable title.

275
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Anyways, because of that, during Game Developers Conference,

276
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
because this is back when they said,

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
okay, downloadable only title, great.

278
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Apparently some people are a little bit pissed off.

279
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
A few people left the actual development team

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
because they were frustrated like this

281
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and basically saying crap product will sell like crap

282
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
if it's on the shelf or not.

283
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So that's kind of my take on this thing.

284
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The game looked okay, but you know what?

285
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I couldn't give a shit about whether it's on a disc,

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
it's on the PlayStation Network or both.

287
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Just release the damn game because I swear to God,

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
the longer it takes this game to come out,

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
the worse it seems to get.

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So that is it.

291
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm done with Warhawk.

292
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't care about Warhawk.

293
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I will never read another story about the game coming out on disc

294
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
or on the network or at all.

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You know, why are we bothered putting together an outline

296
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
if you're just going to skip my stories?

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Whatever.

298
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, it's fine.

299
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Didn't we talk about it last week anyway?

300
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah.

301
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
PlayStation 3 is getting episodic games.

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Who cares?

303
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Because I remember us having a conversation about this last week.

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Who has put together successfully an episodic franchise

305
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
except for Sam & Max as the only one I can think of

306
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
in the past little while that's been successful?

307
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't care about episodic games.

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You know why they're doing episodic games?

309
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's because they go,

310
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Ch-ching, ch-ching, oh, I can make some more money off this shit.

311
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah.

312
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Great, let's put some more episodic content out there

313
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
because the last stuff's done so well so far.

314
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Flaming Bozo in chat room says,

315
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Grand Theft Auto IV is going episodic.

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It has added content, but it has a full game before it.

317
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I guess you could say Oblivion, in a way, is episodic.

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Sort of, yeah.

319
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
A little bit.

320
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, it's the add-ons.

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Shivering Isles is a bit of a new episode.

322
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Resistance will have episodic content, which I can, whatever.

323
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, some of the episodic content you look forward to

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
in each and every episode of Orange Lounge Radio

325
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
is our mailbag.

326
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's the part of the show where you can interact with us

327
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
simply by sending an email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

328
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Dark Sakura will put some hand sanitizing rubber gloves on,

329
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
dive into the mailbag, and pull out her favorite emails

330
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and her least favorite emails to read here on the air.

331
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So you can't send average emails because they don't get read.

332
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No.

333
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
We try to read as many as we can,

334
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
but since, you know, we're so popular and all.

335
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah, right.

336
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No, but sometimes we just get too many.

337
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We can't read them here on the program.

338
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But Dark Sakura does read them all.

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Sometimes.

340
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I read most of them, too, actually.

341
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So unless you're a spammer, then do not actually send this email

342
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
because we're banning IPs.

343
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Let's open up the mailbag, shall we?

344
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Well, we have three.

345
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Dear O.L.R., I recently got a new gaming machine

346
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
and thought I'd send in a review.

347
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
A couple weeks ago, I bought myself a shiny Commodore 128.

348
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'd been wanting to play a 64 for some time,

349
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
largely due to the opinions expressed on your fine show,

350
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but eventually the used market prices dropped on the 128 model

351
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
and I decided that it was worth a dollar to get a newer machine.

352
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sure glad I did.

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What, Rob?

354
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I love whoever wrote this already.

355
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Finish it.

356
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Just read the whole thing.

357
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This is beautiful.

358
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Though having lesser system specs,

359
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
the C128 still holds up well feature-wise

360
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
against other consoles on the market.

361
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It offers backwards compatibility,

362
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
just like each of the major consoles on the market,

363
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
and even supports homebrew, just like modified PSPs do,

364
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
which so far only Microsoft seems to be interested in with their consoles.

365
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The C128 offers more buttons than any current console,

366
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
and it is available in a stylish off-white color

367
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
similar to the DS Lite, Xbox 360, and Wii,

368
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
although somewhat less glossy.

369
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Unfortunately, it still lacks some of the features of the other consoles.

370
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The 128 does not currently support HD output,

371
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
but it is not believed that the Commodore will be addressing that problem

372
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
through firmware or otherwise.

373
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The command mode basic interpreter is also a little bit more difficult to use

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
than, say, channels on the Wii,

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
where everything is laid out for you,

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
and you just point at what you want instead of typing

377
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
load, quote, asterisk, quote, comma, eight,

378
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and cursing whenever you hit the wrong key

379
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
or the file list is longer than one screen.

380
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I remember that for a freaking load runner.

381
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Of course, a system is only as good as the games that are on it,

382
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
and while there are very few C128 games,

383
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
backwards compatibility means that I can enjoy any C64 game

384
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I can get my hands on, of which there are many,

385
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and if you know the discs haven't disintegrated over the last two decades,

386
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
which I understand is a problem,

387
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I cannot seem to get Impossible Mission or The Last Ninja to work.

388
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I even tried blowing into them, but no such luck.

389
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Overall, however, I find the Commodore 128 to be a fine addition

390
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
to my game console lineup,

391
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and I intend to have many more hours of fun with it.

392
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
By right sucks, Warrior Bob.

393
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Seriously, Warrior Bob, I want to have your baby.

394
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That was an awesome email.

395
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Imagine, we could have a little house full of little VIC-20s

396
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and plus fours and sixteens running around everywhere.

397
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You know, that email was beautiful.

398
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Oh, he also sends another email to you.

399
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, really?

400
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You're a rock star.

401
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh, we're so going to get it on with our Commodore.

402
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We should do some Commodore Live gaming,

403
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and we could play, God, what the hell could you play over the modem

404
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
on the Commodore 64 on my 300 baud modem

405
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
that plugged into the back of the Commodore 64?

406
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What kind of games could I play?

407
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I guess over the local bulletin board systems.

408
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
God, no, not even then.

409
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I didn't really hit until I had an IBM.

410
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Was there anything you could play over the modem on the Commodore 64?

411
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Surely we had a modem for some reason.

412
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I played a whole shitload of Kix.

413
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Maybe there was.

414
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Kix was my game.

415
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We'll get together and play some Kix.

416
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Well, the last email comes from...

417
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Wait, you said three emails.

418
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I know, the second one was also from Warrior Bob.

419
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh.

420
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This one's from Philly Girl.

421
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Hi, Orange Lounge.

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I think you are the best podcast ever.

423
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You don't know how much I appreciate you guys,

424
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
but on to what I'm emailing you.

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I've got a dirty joke for you.

426
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What's six to eight inches long,

427
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
goes in and out of your mouth,

428
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
and leaves the white stuff around your lips?

429
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
A penis.

430
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
A toothbrush.

431
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
P.S., I've already signed up on your website

432
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
because you guys are so great.

433
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
My screen name is Vanity Angel from DDR.

434
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Thanks for putting this on the show.

435
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The email had nothing to do with video games.

436
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Somebody just emailed us going,

437
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
hey, I want to tell you a dirty joke.

438
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Pretty much.

439
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
God, I love our listeners.

440
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
In fact, that's even better.

441
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What you need to do is call our Skype line

442
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
or our toll-free number.

443
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

444
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And leave us a voicemail with your favorite dirty joke.

445
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That is a wonderful idea.

446
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Let's have a little contest.

447
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's see who can be the best OLR comedian.

448
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Leave us a voicemail on our Skype line

449
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
or 800 number sometime during the week,

450
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
and we'll play some of our favorites on next week's show.

451
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Just don't forget to leave your name.

452
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
There's a lot of good stuff.

453
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

454
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Toll-free.

455
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
U.S. and Canada.

456
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
U.K. Sorry, you guys are screwed.

457
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You're Australia.

458
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You guys got to use the regular Skype method to do it.

459
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Orange launch radio on Skype.

460
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's a beautiful idea.

461
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
If they're video game jokes, that's even better.

462
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
More points if it's video game themed.

463
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Like dirty Princess Peach jokes.

464
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That would be great.

465
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
This is also great, and it has nothing to do with porn

466
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
or emails or any of that.

467
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Wow, there really wasn't that many emails this week.

468
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's kind of sad.

469
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I cry.

470
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah.

471
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Aww.

472
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Mail back to orangelaunchradio.com.

473
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Send us more stuff.

474
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
This is great.

475
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Great, great news.

476
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Vivendi is looking to actually revive Sierra.

477
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh, this is great news because Vivendi,

478
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
you know, years ago, they bought out Sierra or whatever

479
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and they offshoot Sierra online.

480
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And now it looks like Vivendi is going to be reviving Sierra somewhat.

481
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Sierra, of course, is well known in the PC gaming segment,

482
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
but the name is going to get ramped up in the next few years

483
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
with other games that were originally released on the Sierra brand.

484
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
World in Conflict and Time Shift will be names that are coming out very soon

485
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
that will have the Sierra brand.

486
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Here's a quote here from Vivendi CEO Bruce Hack.

487
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Quote, the revival of the Sierra brand comes from product.

488
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Over time, as our products become better and establish themselves

489
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
as perennial franchises, the name Sierra will be given a stronger life.

490
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
As we move forward, our products get stronger,

491
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and as they are established as franchises, the name Sierra will be strengthened.

492
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
No news yet, though, on a new Police Quest game, which kind of makes me sad.

493
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Or Leisure Suit Larry.

494
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Well, I guess, then again, Leisure Suit Larry went somewhere else, right?

495
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He went to a dirty, dirty place.

496
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yeah, I remember that console title a couple years ago.

497
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It wasn't that hot.

498
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Or King's Quest.

499
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I mean, I know there's a fan project, don't get me wrong,

500
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
the silver lining game, but who wouldn't?

501
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I mean, even the guys behind that, I'm sure,

502
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
would love to see something official as well to complement that, though.

503
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
We'll see.

504
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Yeah.

505
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Anyways, in the meantime, if you can't get your King's Quest

506
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
or Leisure Suit Larry or Police Quest or Space Quest fix,

507
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
you can always get your Sam & Max fix.

508
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And, of course, they've already, I think they're up through Episode 6 now

509
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
of the first season of the Sam & Max episodic game.

510
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Well, if you don't want to download it via a download service,

511
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
you can play it when it comes to retail.

512
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And it actually is being, it's heading to retail,

513
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
thanks to Joe Wood for the U.K.,

514
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and I forget who's doing it in the U.S.,

515
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
but you soon will be able to purchase Sam & Max,

516
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and it will be available in August of 2007.

517
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Comments from the chat room on the last story.

518
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Sorry to deviate a little bit, but some interesting things on Sierra.

519
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
James Patrick in chat says, please, Sierra is dead.

520
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Sierra Studios, we're in the Sierra Mountains.

521
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That studio is closed.

522
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Therefore, Sierra, the real Sierra, is dead.

523
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And the adventure company is the one bringing it over here to the United States.

524
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I love Sam & Max, and I don't know why I haven't played it yet.

525
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
By the way, Sierra and Sam & Max have nothing to do with each other,

526
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
but the chat room is a little bit behind.

527
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
There's a little bit of live lag, so there you have it.

528
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Sorry, I had a complete and utter brain fart.

529
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Why? What happened? Were you daydreaming during the show?

530
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Is that what's going on?

531
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
No, I did my Reiki class today, so I've been sort of out of it.

532
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Maybe me and Captain America can run off and have a family together.

533
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'll pursue my massage therapy,

534
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
and he can have a successful business as a crime fighter.

535
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
What the fuck?

536
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Okay, so how about a story?

537
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I'd like to see that in a comic.

538
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
How about a story?

539
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
No, how about more Jamie and Captain America slash fanfic?

540
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
What?

541
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We'll name our family the Avengers.

542
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That's the custom license plate we'll have on our minivan.

543
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Can I please see this posted on fanfic.net or whatever that site is?

544
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
No, because anyone who writes any fanfiction at all

545
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,000
involving any characterization of me will be sued for libel or something.

546
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
No sense of humor.

547
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No, I have no sense of humor because it was stupid.

548
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Then make a character named Sark Dakra.

549
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
No.

550
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I can see it now.

551
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
They're barbecuing on a Weber grill that's painted to look like

552
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
the Captain America shield.

553
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That was stupid.

554
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
How about the next?

555
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Hey, you're the one that had a brain fart and derailed the show.

556
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Shut up.

557
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
No pie for you.

558
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I was going to get you pie.

559
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Anyway, story.

560
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
For anyone who likes their MMOs,

561
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Turbine is offering the former subscribers of the Dungeons & Dragons

562
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
online game a free weekend of gaming,

563
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
actually which is over right now.

564
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But for those in Europe,

565
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
you're going to get an additional bonus for 10 days of free gaming.

566
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So you can enjoy their module 3.3.

567
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's supposed to beef up their character stuff.

568
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Also, for those who are currently subscribed,

569
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
you will get 50% more experience and a plus one to loot found

570
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and lots of live events.

571
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So basically they're saying,

572
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
we don't want to go out of business.

573
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So there you go.

574
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
All righty.

575
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Well, changing gears completely here, talking about some,

576
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
well, maybe, I don't know, maybe they'll show D&D online at this.

577
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Who knows?

578
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But of course, the E for All Expo is being held October 18th

579
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
through the 21st at the LA Convention Center,

580
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
which is where E3 used to be.

581
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And of course, E for All is supposed to be kind of like that public version

582
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
of E3, but we're not sure exactly how much like E3 it's going to be

583
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
because part of us are kind of thinking,

584
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
well, they probably won't actually show any new games there.

585
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
They're just going to kind of show existing games and have tournaments.

586
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Who knows what's going to happen?

587
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But we do know that Sony and Nintendo have both signed on board.

588
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So they are going to be appearing at the E for All Expo.

589
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Now, the Expo is actually only going to be in the south hall.

590
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Now, those of you that went to E3 in the past know that

591
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Nintendo and Sony were traditionally in the west hall.

592
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So therefore, we know that Sony and Nintendo's boost will be

593
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
a little bit smaller than what we know from E3 past.

594
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
But still, the fact that they are going really gives a boost,

595
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I think, in some regards to the E for All Expo.

596
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
If you want to go, hey, it's only $100,

597
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
but the tickets are not currently on sale.

598
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
They will be made available in the future, I guess.

599
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But certainly, Sony and Nintendo signing on

600
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
does really help out this new show.

601
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So we'll see what happens.

602
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Will they be using Kensha Hall?

603
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
That would be fun.

604
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
They'll probably have a gun show going on in Kensha Hall while this is going on.

605
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Gun show?

606
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
No, seriously.

607
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
One time...

608
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
They should do Kensha Con.

609
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
No, for real.

610
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Like, one year I went to the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention

611
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
in Las Vegas, which is at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

612
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And we had the right side of the building for the costume contest,

613
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
the live speakers, because they had people from the movie there and everything.

614
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And then the left side was a gun show.

615
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So you had people in fishnets and full...

616
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
For those that have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.

617
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Full Dr. Frank-N-Furter garb and little Columbias in sequined outfits.

618
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
People just basically dressed like fucking freaks,

619
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
intermingling with the gun show people.

620
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And the most hilarious part was that the ATM was in the gun show room.

621
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So if any Rocky people wanted money to buy their crap,

622
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
they had to actually go into the gun show and get pointed at

623
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
and stared at by the folks there.

624
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So I would love to see the gun show go on at the same...

625
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Or the doll show.

626
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Because it's also inevitable that the gun show and the doll show is always together.

627
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Have you noticed this?

628
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
There's always, like, a gun show and a doll show.

629
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Or a bridal pair.

630
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah, the gun show, the doll show, and the bridal pair.

631
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Anyway, sorry.

632
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The Dolls with Guns show.

633
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That'd be funny.

634
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Anyways...

635
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Poto says, Guns next to games?

636
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Just what he who shall not be named once.

637
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Anyways, so there's a brand new game coming out now

638
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
that's probably one of those serious games

639
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
that will help kids deal with the complex emotions

640
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
surrounding marriage, or divorce in this case.

641
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The game is called Earthquake and Zipland

642
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and it deals with a king and queen who are suddenly separated by

643
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
when this giant zipper that's held the two parts of the small island together

644
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,000
has come apart and then your main character tries and tries and tries to

645
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
fix the island and combine them to bring the king and queen back together.

646
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
But spoiler alert!

647
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
They don't.

648
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And there's no way that he can.

649
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So there you go.

650
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
No way you can fix a marriage.

651
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You might as well throw yourself into the ocean and die.

652
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Does the game tell you that, too?

653
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That's really pleasant.

654
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
No, but that's where I took from it.

655
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I could be wrong, but, you know.

656
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh, okay.

657
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But then again, I'm not a 12-year-old that's played this game.

658
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'm neither of those.

659
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Dark Soccer, do you think we need a game to help kids understand divorce?

660
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Um, no.

661
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
People just shouldn't get married.

662
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
They should have an expo.

663
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Seriously, think about it.

664
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
If, like, there was, like, no marriage, you know, none at all,

665
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and everybody, you know, was just like, you know, had, like, common law deal

666
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
or, you know, then there wouldn't be a problem.

667
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh, well, Daddy decided that he and Mommy were going to break up,

668
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
so he just moved out.

669
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
No problem.

670
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
They should find out that the reason that the island split in two

671
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
is because the king was having sex with some other chick.

672
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Daddy's moving in with Uncle Bob.

673
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I personally, I basically, my parents were divorced, you know,

674
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
before I had any memory of them being married.

675
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So I, from that point of view, I couldn't really say if a game would help with that

676
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
because I just always grew up understanding what divorce was.

677
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Seriously, my parents have been together ever since, you know, I was born.

678
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
They were together for, like, you know, 15 years before I was born,

679
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and they're still together today, and I need a game to help me understand

680
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
why they're still together after all these years.

681
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
What I don't get is why people who obviously hate each other's fucking guts,

682
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
oh, we're staying together for the kids.

683
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Meanwhile, you're giving them a fucking complex because you hate each other.

684
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Why does Mommy and Daddy fight?

685
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Why do they hate each other?

686
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You would all be happier if you'd just go ahead and get a divorce.

687
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Well, I'm sure we'll be getting some e-mails on that one.

688
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Mailbag.

689
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't believe in staying together for the children.

690
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I believe in giving the children a healthier environment to exist in.

691
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
All right.

692
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Well, we'll see what kind of Pandora's Box that comment opens.

693
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I grew up just fine with my divorced parents, okay?

694
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
All right.

695
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
We'll see what happens.

696
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
All right, anyway, we're going to see what happens with this, too.

697
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It's our Website of the Week.

698
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
DarkSakura likes to surf the Internet every which way she possibly can every week,

699
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
and she finds a website suitable to share with the rest of you,

700
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
or in this week's case it may be a little bit unsuitable.

701
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
We shall see.

702
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It's DarkSakura's website, what?

703
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I heard about this site from you a long time ago.

704
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Don't say that because it's not in the proper context here.

705
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You're not giving it the proper context.

706
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You heard about it from me on a radio program a couple years ago.

707
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
La, la, la, la, la.

708
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Just play me my damn music.

709
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm going to go run and hide.

710
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:01,000
The Website of the Week, again, is one that Rob mentioned a long time ago.

711
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Mantis.net.

712
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Sorry.

713
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Mantis are panties made for men, and they're frilly and lacy,

714
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
and you can get them high cut.

715
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You can get briefs, and you can get nylon or lace,

716
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and they have all kinds of designs, and they have seven day ones,

717
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
and they're really pretty,

718
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and plus they're made spacious in the front for special needs of men.

719
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
So, guys, if you want to be pretty,

720
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
if you feel like being a little dressier than usual,

721
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:52,000
you should go to mantis.net.

722
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Chat room, the answer to your question is no.

723
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
That would be no.

724
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That's so wrong.

725
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I feel dirty.

726
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
But you can still feel dirty yet pretty underneath, and no one knows but you.

727
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
It's a great idea.

728
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm looking at the embroidered ones, and they have hearts on them or balloons.

729
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Hey, PowerShot Pinball Constructor is coming out for the Nintendo DS.

730
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Oxygen Games just announced this coming out very soon,

731
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
because Metroid Prime Pinball did pretty well, so here we go.

732
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
PowerShot Pinball Constructor.

733
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So I guess it sounds like you can make your own table in this game,

734
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
which sounds kind of cool.

735
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yeah, it has a table editor in it,

736
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
and of course that makes me think of pinball construction set on the Commodore 64.

737
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Pinball is fucking awesome.

738
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So now you can make your own table.

739
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So that means if I wanted to make a table of nothing but like 50 bumpers,

740
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
I could do that.

741
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Do you remember the hyperball machine, though?

742
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
All it was was nothing but multiball.

743
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Oh, I don't remember that.

744
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It would just shoot out a bunch of balls,

745
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and you'd have to shoot them back down on the thing.

746
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
If I wanted to build pinball machines,

747
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I would get Dan to buy one and fix it for me.

748
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
All right, well, now you can do it on the palm of your hand on the DS.

749
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
There you go.

750
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Anyways, so Zelda co-creator Eiji Aonuma,

751
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
confirmed in an interview with Game Informer

752
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:33,000
that Phantom Hourglass for the DS will feature an online multiplayer mode,

753
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
and they didn't really see what it's going to feature,

754
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
but he did answer yes when they asked

755
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
if there was going to be online battles over the Nintendo Wi-Fi service.

756
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
So that's interesting, I guess.

757
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Maybe I'm thinking it's going to be something like Four Swords, maybe.

758
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That would be kind of neat.

759
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I don't know.

760
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
That would be pretty cool.

761
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Four Swords was actually a really, really cool game.

762
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Four Swords was a much fun game on the GameCube.

763
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That game was awesome.

764
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
When you could find people that had the advances and the cords

765
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
to play the damn game with, it was a fun game.

766
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I thought I heard...

767
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Now, I can't remember...

768
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Correct me if I'm wrong,

769
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
because I never played Four Swords Adventure or something like that.

770
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Did it have an online mode or something where someone...

771
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
There's a couple tri-forces on the map or something like that.

772
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I think we talked about this maybe last week,

773
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
where you basically drew a path that this warrior thing follows or something.

774
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
That's the multiplayer in the Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

775
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh, okay.

776
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Yeah.

777
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I think that was Bobby telling us about him playing it at GDC.

778
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
That's right.

779
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That's what he was saying.

780
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's what we were hanging out with him last week.

781
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Yeah.

782
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Anyways, so as Bobby was telling us from GDC,

783
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
it's basically there's a couple tri-forces on the map,

784
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,000
and you can't, I think, see the player if they have a tri-force

785
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
or don't have a tri-force, something like that.

786
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Basically, one player controls the three guards,

787
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
and you draw a path that they follow and stuff like that.

788
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It sounds interesting.

789
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's kind of like that Pac-Man multiplayer game that was on the GameCube.

790
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Pac-Man Versus, which they so need on the Wii and online.

791
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Or on Xbox Live then, because if Nintendo's not going to do it,

792
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
then fucking put Pac-Man Versus on Xbox Live.

793
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
That's what we should have gotten instead of old-school Pac-Man,

794
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
but that's just my opinion.

795
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yeah.

796
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
What do I know?

797
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I don't know, Rob.

798
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
What do you know?

799
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
How about some stuff?

800
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I know stuff.

801
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
There is a little bit of information, though.

802
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I know I'm not visiting your website of the week this week.

803
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Rob.

804
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Yeah?

805
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So there is an unholy union between In the Groove and Pump It Up.

806
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's like they got together after taking a lot of LSD and bread.

807
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So now there's a Pump It Up Pro.

808
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yeah.

809
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm not going to say anything else about that.

810
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
God, where do I begin?

811
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
A, those of you that were saying that In the Groove was going to somehow be absorbed into Konami

812
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and Dance Dance Revolution.

813
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
No.

814
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Was going to have In the Groove songs.

815
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
No.

816
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And here's further proof that that ain't happening,

817
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
because it's been absorbed into Pump It Up, it looks like.

818
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's pretty much all the songs that were done by Kyle Ward are now on Pump It Up.

819
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
That's about it.

820
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
So in other words, Andy Mero threw a bunch of money at Kyle Ward, and that's it?

821
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Because Andy Mero, but Andy Mero and Roxor had, I guess, a working relationship, right?

822
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Because those In the Groove 2 cabinets, of which I've still never seen one in my entire life,

823
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
were made, well wait, I take that back.

824
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
There might have been one at that 8 on the Break place in Jersey when I went there a long time ago.

825
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I can't remember.

826
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
But regardless, Andy Mero made those cabinets for him, right?

827
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Yeah, I think so.

828
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So they already had a little bit of a working relationship.

829
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So this actually doesn't surprise me so much.

830
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yeah, you're going to see songs like, for example, Oasis, as well as,

831
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
there's a bunch of other stuff I recognized on there when I was watching the videos of them.

832
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Exotica, Esperanza, let's see here, Destiny.

833
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It was a bunch of songs, I think, from In the Groove that were in there.

834
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I mean, don't get me wrong, I like some of Kyle Ward's songs.

835
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I really like the stuff he does under, what is it, Bonsai is the name?

836
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The Zodiac and Anubis and all those songs.

837
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
But still, I don't know, it's just weird.

838
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
And I know, like, Miggletove wanted to come on the show tonight, but he had to leave.

839
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I know he's a hardcore Pump It Up fan.

840
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
He ain't happy about this.

841
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Zodiac?

842
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Is the In the Groove thing crossing over to Pump It Up?

843
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I don't think it's really crossing over.

844
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I think it's more of just they have him now as an artist, and that's it.

845
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So he's taking his songs with them.

846
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I mean, the guy's got to work, so whatever.

847
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That doesn't necessarily mean he's just, you know, it's In the Groove now.

848
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
They did, I like what they've done with the interface.

849
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The interface is not retarded as it usually is on Pump.

850
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So that's kind of nice.

851
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But other than that, I don't really think it's In the Groove.

852
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's just that it's got, you know, Kyle Ward doing music for him.

853
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Great.

854
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Well, I think what's great about this is it just proves us right,

855
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
that those songs were not going to be ever showing up in DDR.

856
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah.

857
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
In the Groove, DDR, right.

858
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Alrighty.

859
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Let's see, if you would like to call us, we're going to open up the Skype line here very shortly,

860
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
because we encourage your interaction here on this program as well.

861
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and our 800 number,

862
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
if you want to call us that way, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

863
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It looks like we have some In on the Break fans or folks that live near there.

864
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Blaze says, 8 on the Break for the win.

865
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
DDR Dollar Bill says, yeah, 8 on the Break.

866
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Rama says, Sky, that was a beta In the Groove 2.

867
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Chinatown Fair has In the Groove 2 and a Pump It Up box.

868
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
So yeah, I went to 8 on the, I've been to 8 on the Break.

869
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I want to say I've been there a couple times, actually.

870
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I think I went out there once randomly when I was on the East Coast.

871
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I went there again for some DDR tournament.

872
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And I played some game that was some beat game I'd never seen in my life.

873
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I don't remember, sorry.

874
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Let's see, Shadow Charlie wants to know what happened.

875
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Speaking of Zodiac, what happened to the Zodiac remix that Loki made

876
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
that was during the bonus segment of last week's show?

877
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Check his community page on all games.

878
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's there.

879
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And apparently 8 on the Break has 2 In the Groove 2 machines now.

880
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
There you have it.

881
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
All right, let's go ahead and head on over to the Skype line

882
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
and start taking some calls.

883
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

884
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Ravenstaufen. Let me turn down the thing.

885
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
All right, hi, Ravenstaufen. What's on your mind?

886
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I got a podcast now.

887
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You have a podcast now?

888
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Mm-hmm.

889
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Oh, God, everybody and their fucking mom has a podcast now.

890
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Why should we listen to yours?

891
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Because it's a tech podcast, Sky.

892
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Something different.

893
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
It's a tech podcast.

894
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
This Week in Ravenstaufen?

895
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Sort of.

896
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
What's it called?

897
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's called RavenstechReview.

898
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
All right, and where can we access RavenstechReview?

899
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
On the All Games forums.

900
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And it's being submitted to iTunes soon.

901
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Hope it's going to be up there.

902
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
All right, we'll see.

903
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Hopefully coming soon to the iTunes store.

904
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Well, Raven, talk games with us because we don't...

905
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Well, I mean, we do talk tech, but we talk video games.

906
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
What did you think of some of our stories tonight?

907
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I think they're interesting, but you're missing one more.

908
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And I viewed it on my site.

909
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It's the Commodore computer coming back.

911
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I didn't...

912
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Because I think we hit...

913
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
We talked about it last week.

914
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah, we talked about it last week.

915
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
That's why.

916
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Oh, yeah, you did?

917
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah, we did.

918
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yeah, that's all right.

919
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
What do you think?

920
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
As a tech-inclined individual, what do you think of Commodore making a comeback in the,

921
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I don't know, competing with Alienware or something market?

922
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I think it's interesting.

923
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I don't know if it's going to be an operating system.

924
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
You remember the Commodore had a different operating system than the DOS.

925
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Right.

926
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
So I don't know what they're going to do.

927
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I don't know if it's going to be Commodore just placed in there with a Windows operating system,

928
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
or they're going to go with something different.

929
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
But it's interesting.

930
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Something tells me, since Commodore BASIC is very antiquated,

931
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I think you're going to just get a normal Windows PC in there.

932
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I was just interesting about that.

933
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And I'll tell you, I'm not going to miss syntax error one bit or load quote star quote comma eight comma one.

934
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I ain't going to miss that shit.

935
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I don't miss it at all, but two more things.

936
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
The fuck did comma eight comma one mean anyway?

937
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I have no idea.

938
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Two more things.

939
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It was just their command line.

940
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I think it was like the device number or something.

941
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Well, why was the disk drive eight?

942
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It was always eight.

943
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I think like once in a blue moon you might have seven.

944
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
But anyway, sorry.

945
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
This would be This Week in Raven from 1984.

946
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
You have to listen to it.

947
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
What else is on your mind, Raven?

948
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Two more things on my mind.

949
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Vampire for the Commodore 64.

950
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You ever played Vampire?

951
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm familiar with the title, but I can't remember the game play.

952
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Fun game.

953
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It's on game tab.

954
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I was going to say, I think it's on game tab.

955
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I think that's where I've seen it.

956
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I have not played it.

957
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
What do you do in Vampire?

958
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And don't say you're a vampire.

959
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I am not a vampire.

960
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
No, I meant in the game.

961
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
This one goes to Dark Soccer.

962
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
What?

963
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Flintstones Pinball.

964
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You ever heard of it?

965
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I think so.

966
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I don't think I was very interested in it.

967
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Was it based off the movie?

968
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Yeah, it was.

969
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I played that table once, and because it was the movie,

970
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,000
it felt like I felt unclean after playing it.

971
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And I had to go change out of my manties.

972
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Alright.

973
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Bye Raven's Dolphin.

974
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Take care.

975
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Alright, if you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR,

976
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
or you can always call us on the Skype line, Orange Lounge Radio.

977
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Alright, let's go to the phones and take another call.

978
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

979
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Who's this?

980
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'll give you three guesses, and the first letters are J, A, and S.

981
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Oh, it's Jazz.

982
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
God, you haven't been on the show in a long time.

983
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
No.

984
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Hi, Jason.

985
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
What's on your mind?

986
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
You have to fail at spelling, Rob.

987
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Jeez.

988
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Mr. VX JasonXV himself, our webmaster extraordinaire.

989
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Extraordinaire.

990
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Hey, VX, our website held up amongst being on the front page

991
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
of Dig and Joystiq and Kotaku and all that stuff,

992
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Destructoid and all that this week.

993
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
So, good job.

994
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Really good to know.

995
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I've kept looking, and I've kept checking.

996
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I saw when you guys rumen always upsell.

997
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Crazy shit.

998
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Well, what do we owe this phone call to tonight?

999
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I would love a new Space Quest game.

1000
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Who wouldn't?

1001
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I would absolutely love it.

1002
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
But do you think it's actually going to happen?

1003
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I don't know.

1004
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Haven't kept up.

1005
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I just heard it, and I thought it was cool.

1006
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
How many games are in the Space Quest franchise?

1007
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I can't remember.

1008
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Six.

1009
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Wow.

1010
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So there were that many games in the Space Quest series?

1011
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I always thought there was only the three or four that were in it.

1012
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Wow.

1013
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
There was.

1014
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
The first four were all the keyboard navigational.

1015
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
The fifth actually introduced the mouse,

1016
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
and then the sixth actually introduced the announcer

1017
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
and even more interactivity.

1018
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Five was awesome.

1019
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's the first one I played.

1020
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I got the anthology and played the old ones,

1021
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and then I played six, and I was blown away

1022
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
because it was a big difference, and it was so good.

1023
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
For the kids today who may have never played Space Quest in the past,

1024
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
what makes this game so frickin' great?

1025
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Humor.

1026
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You have to read, but it's all in the humor,

1027
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
and it's a great puzzle game.

1028
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
All right.

1029
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Let's see.

1030
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
We out?

1031
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I was just saying that's the best part about it.

1032
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It is a funny game.

1033
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It is very witty.

1034
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
It's great to read.

1035
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It is a game that puts you through a book adventure,

1036
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
and I loved it.

1037
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
All right.

1038
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Well, I hope Vivendi, Sierra, whoever hears your calls,

1039
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
and maybe will come out with something new,

1040
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
but don't hold your breath.

1041
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Yeah.

1042
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
All right.

1043
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1044
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I believe so.

1045
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1046
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I beat Turtles Arcade at five o'clock in the morning.

1047
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Good job.

1048
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Were you by yourself, or did you have a bunch of other people?

1049
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I was by myself.

1050
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Oh, but you get unlimited continues by yourself.

1051
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
How many continues did you have to use?

1052
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Oh, I don't even know.

1053
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Call me back and brag when it's three or less, buddy.

1054
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
All right.

1055
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Just teasing.

1056
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Congratulations.

1057
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It's fine.

1058
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You know, actually, there's a YouTube I saw somewhere

1059
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
of a guy running through the entire game on one credit.

1060
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It was amazing.

1061
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I don't know how anyone does it.

1062
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
A lot of people claim about, you know, single credit arcade runs,

1063
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and I know I don't have any game I could say I've done such a thing with.

1064
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Me neither.

1065
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
All right.

1066
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
All right, Jason.

1067
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Well, thanks for all you do for us,

1068
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, all righty?

1069
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Sweet.

1070
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Later.

1071
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Have a good night.

1072
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
You too.

1073
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
All right.

1074
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
If you want to call us 1-877-GAME-OLR, remember it's your show, too.

1075
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
We want to hear what you guys have to say.

1076
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So let's go to another call here on the Skype line.

1077
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1078
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Who's this?

1079
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Hey, this is Darkshi.

1080
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Hi, Darkshi?

1081
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Yeah.

1082
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Ah, Darkshi.

1083
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
What's on your mind, my friend?

1084
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
First I want to say it's kind of amazing.

1085
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It's the first time on the air.

1086
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
I was going to say I don't recognize your name as calling in before.

1087
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I know your name from chat, but you've never called in before,

1088
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
so welcome, noob.

1089
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
What's on your mind?

1090
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Well, first off, I just saw 300 today, and I heard of a game coming out.

1091
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And my friend's all, so I saw, like, oh, it should be on PS3.

1092
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's so amazing it deserves to be on PS3.

1093
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And I've never heard of it.

1094
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Like, what?

1095
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
It does sound a little bit like a fanboy's wet dream such as Kill Bill the game.

1096
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
If there's any game that's slated to come out, Loki would know about it.

1097
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
300?

1098
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Are they really making a game out of 300?

1099
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Yeah, they did a PSP game, and it wasn't very good.

1100
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Oh, so there is a PSP game, huh?

1101
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah.

1102
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
What do you do in the PSP game?

1103
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
You just hack and slash type stuff.

1104
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Put your ears through people's faces and all that fun stuff?

1105
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I guess.

1106
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
It didn't give very good reviews, and it came out a couple weeks ago, last week in February.

1107
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So, but you say your friend said it should come out on PS3.

1108
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah, he said, like, oh, it's such a great game, and he's a PS3 fanboy.

1109
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
He wants every single game.

1110
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Did he not get his PSP and his PS3 confused, maybe?

1111
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Because we don't know of its existence on PlayStation 3.

1112
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I told him, like, he said it deserves to be on PS3.

1113
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
He's saying, like, oh, it's so amazing.

1114
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
At the same time, the PS3 wasn't all that great.

1115
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Well, you know, I think the movie's been doing very well.

1116
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
It was at the top of the box office again the second week in a row.

1117
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I think it's inevitable you're going to see a sequel to 300 at some point.

1118
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Well, can you do a sequel to 300?

1119
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I guess not, because it's based on history, huh?

1120
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It's based on a comic series.

1121
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Oh, is it? Well, then there might, I guess, who knows?

1122
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I haven't seen it. I'm not on the 300 fan wagon.

1123
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I don't know if it's just one novel thing or something.

1124
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Well, we'll see. So maybe, if possible, they'll have a sequel later on.

1125
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Otherwise, you'll see something like it.

1126
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
And who knows? Again, if it's tied into comics and they do more comics,

1127
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
it could be possible you get another game or two out of this a little later on down the line,

1128
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
especially with the movie being as popular as it is.

1129
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yeah, yeah. And I have one more thing.

1130
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Sure. What's up?

1131
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
All right. I remember so, so many years ago about hearing about Phantom Hourglass,

1132
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
and it just came out now, or coming out now,

1133
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
and I'm like, is this like a tradition for the Zelda games or something?

1134
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Yes.

1135
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Pretty much, sadly. Yeah.

1136
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Phantom Hourglass, they debuted at what?

1137
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Didn't they first show that off at E305, I almost want to say?

1138
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Maybe it was E306.

1139
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It was either E306 or it was either that or Tokyo Game Show or something like that.

1140
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Yeah, it has been a long time.

1141
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Yeah, it's pretty much tradition for the Zelda series at this point.

1142
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Oh, except the CDI ones came out pretty quickly.

1143
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Just kidding. All right.

1144
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Well, are you looking forward to Phantom Hourglass?

1145
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yeah, I'm a big fan of Zelda.

1146
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't own every game.

1147
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
What do you think about the multiplayer mode we were talking about?

1148
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Do you think it's going to be fun on the Internet?

1149
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I'm hoping so, because I can't really think of Zelda online,

1150
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
so maybe they'll surprise me.

1151
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It's hard to think about Nintendo online these days,

1152
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
but yeah, Zelda's definitely a step in the right direction, so we'll see.

1153
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah.

1154
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
All right. Well, Darkside, thank you so much for the call,

1155
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
and call again sometime, all right?

1156
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
All right.

1157
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Later.

1158
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Have fun with Phantom Hourglass and all those hours you're going to be putting into that.

1159
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
All right, I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

1160
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Sorry to those folks that did not get through.

1161
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
We apologize, but everybody's trying to hammer the line there, so it happens.

1162
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Let's see, going to the chat room, trying to read the comments there

1163
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
to some of those previous calls we took.

1164
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
SSJ100Matt says, I hear the 300 game is awful.

1165
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
GS68 says, bring on the max 300 jokes.

1166
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Let's see, SSJ100Matt says you could have 302 electric boogaloo.

1167
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
All right, there you have it.

1168
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
We'll take more calls next week.

1169
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Of course, again, Loki's challenge to leave us a dirty joke on the Skype line,

1170
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
that's open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1171
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You can do that all week long.

1172
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I'm going to go around and see if there's any last-minute stories

1173
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
anybody would like to share tonight, last-minute stories.

1174
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I've been trying to find the information on it, but I can't actually find it.

1175
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
There's actually a new pinball table coming out later this year

1176
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
that's a Monty Python theme, and we're actually going to get it.

1177
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Like a Spamalot table?

1178
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I don't know if it's Spamalot, because there's already a Holy Grail table.

1179
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I thought that they were either going to do Meaning of Life or Life of Brian.

1180
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I think it's Meaning of Life.

1181
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I think that's pretty cool.

1182
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Always look on the bright side.

1183
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
That was Life of Brian.

1184
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah, I know, but you know.

1185
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Meaning of Life had the...

1186
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It's just a way for thin mint.

1187
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Wasn't Meaning of Life the one that was in the office building in the beginning?

1188
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
That was actually a different...

1189
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It was supposed to be a lot shorter,

1190
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
but unfortunately they let Terry Gilliam have his way,

1191
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
and it was the...

1192
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
What was it? The Crimson something assurance?

1193
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I remember that scene going on forever.

1194
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
All forever a scene went on.

1195
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I love that scene.

1196
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Anyhow.

1197
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Isn't it great to charter an accountant?

1198
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
That one.

1199
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
The Rob D. says about the Monty Python table,

1200
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:21,000
every time you hit a bumper, I fart in your general direction.

1201
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Every time you hit a bumper.

1202
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
That's cute.

1203
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And now for something completely different.

1204
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Monty Python pinball table.

1205
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
That's a good name for a table.

1206
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Loki, anything from you?

1207
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Just a couple small things.

1208
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
One, Splatterhouse is supposed to be...

1209
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
is confirmed apparently for Virtual Console this Monday.

1210
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So we're going to be seeing that.

1211
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I'm going to tell you right now,

1212
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Splatterhouse is one of those games

1213
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
you're going to think back to your childhood and go,

1214
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
this game was awesome,

1215
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
but when you all downloaded on Monday,

1216
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
the game was not that good.

1217
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It really wasn't.

1218
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I remember how bad it was.

1219
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
But it's still funny though.

1220
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
If you want that Friday the 13th vibe to it.

1221
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
There you go.

1222
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Let's see what else here.

1223
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Oh, apparently it started now on the PlayStation 3

1224
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
on one of the previous firmwares.

1225
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Up until 1.51, they're seeing holes

1226
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and they've exploited a TIFF exploit,

1227
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
basically causing a buffer overflow like they did on the PSP

1228
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
to run their own code.

1229
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
So it's only a matter of time before they break the PlayStation 3

1230
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
and have piracy rampant on there as well as homebrew and stuff.

1231
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
So I'm waiting.

1232
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
That's it.

1233
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
All right.

1234
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
And I don't have anything either.

1235
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So I guess we're here to the end of the show.

1236
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
So that's it.

1237
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1238
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I'll start.

1239
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Loki, Loki, your final thought.

1240
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
My final thought is...

1241
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I think I have some good games on Virtual Console.

1242
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I haven't bought anything lately.

1243
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
My final thought is Moonkin Forum is only 15,000 experience away.

1244
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Woot.

1245
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And I'm a wow addict.

1246
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
DarkSakura, your final thought.

1247
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
We're finishing pretty fucking early.

1248
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yeah, this is the short show tonight.

1249
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It's kind of weird for us, but that's okay.

1250
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
It's been a compact and good show, a lot of information.

1251
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
We talked about it a lot in part A and part B.

1252
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
We'll do it all again next week.

1253
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
In the meantime, thank you guys so much for tuning into

1254
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and supporting independent internet radio.

1255
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You guys are awesome, and it's because of you,

1256
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
we continue to do this show every week in and week out.

1257
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
So we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio,

1258
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
March the 25th for episode number 225.

1259
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Is that like a landmark number?

1260
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Because it's like a multiple of 25.

1261
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I don't know.

1262
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Not so much.

1263
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
All right.

1264
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
250 maybe.

1265
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
250 maybe.

1266
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Or our five-year birthday is just around the corner.

1267
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I say we get a stripper for the fifth birthday.

1268
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
We'll see.

1269
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
All right.

1270
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Anyhow, in the meantime, that's it for this week.

1271
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

1272
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Tune in next week to find out which website calls us a liar next.

1273
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
That'll be fun.

1274
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Bye.

1275
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
