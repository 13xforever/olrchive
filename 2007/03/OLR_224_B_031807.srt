00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:14,755
[SPEAKER_08]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:19,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:22,439
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:27,722
[SPEAKER_10]: It is March 18, 2007, and you're on Part B of our podcast series.

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,951
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

7
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:52,675
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

8
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:19,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Best Buy, Best Buy, Best Buy

9
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:49,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, here's an interesting spin on it, though.

10
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:54,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Our company, we haven't been able to get 20 gig systems for a while now.

11
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:59,465
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are basically have been discontinued in our system as well.

12
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:02,707
[SPEAKER_06]: And this has been, I think, going on for about over a month.

13
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:09,972
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wouldn't be surprised if this is true, if they're discontinuing the 20 gig system, probably because they're making more money off the 60 gig system.

14
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:13,435
[SPEAKER_06]: And not a lot of people were snatching up the 20 gig system.

15
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:14,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

16
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I think 20 gig was still pretty fine.

17
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:16,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

18
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,540
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 is enough space for right now at least.

19
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,500
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

20
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Not for the Xbox 360 with all that movie stuff.

21
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:24,841
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm almost out of space.

22
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:27,102
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I don't know.

23
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:28,322
[SPEAKER_10]: I think about that with the PlayStation 3.

24
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:31,963
[SPEAKER_10]: When I jump ship, I probably will get the 60 gig model just because I'm a consumer whore.

25
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:32,964
[SPEAKER_04]: And how?

26
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:36,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I will just upgrade my hard drive in there.

27
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:39,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's something cool.

28
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:42,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of, we had talked about Tecmo earlier.

29
00:02:43,787 --> 00:02:45,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Tecmo is bringing out Ninja Gaiden Sigma and

30
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:55,142
[SPEAKER_04]: as a has new backgrounds, enemies, characters, animations, textures completely revamped for the next system.

31
00:02:56,483 --> 00:03:01,287
[SPEAKER_04]: You can partially or fully install the game on the PS3 to help with load time.

32
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:07,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It will run at 60 frames per second, self-shadowing, and in 720p.

33
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:10,734
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots of Ninja Gaiden action.

34
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:13,936
[SPEAKER_04]: You also get a playable Rachel.

35
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:17,649
[SPEAKER_04]: You, uh, apparently supposed to be very bouncy.

36
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, it's Team Ninja.

37
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:21,711
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

38
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:30,437
[SPEAKER_10]: My question is, will I actually be able to get anywhere in the game without getting frustrated so that I throw my controller through the screen?

39
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody can help that you suck at it, Rob.

40
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:34,400
[SPEAKER_10]: No, everybody sucks at Ninja Gaiden.

41
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:34,840
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

42
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,021
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fucking hard game.

43
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:37,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan was pretty good at it.

44
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:40,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Dan is a god among men then, I guess.

45
00:03:40,624 --> 00:03:41,404
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what to tell you.

46
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:43,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I only marry awesome.

47
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:44,146
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

48
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:48,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, a game I'm really looking forward to on the PlayStation 3.

49
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:53,172
[SPEAKER_10]: And how sad is it that this is one of the games I'm really looking forward to on the PlayStation 3?

50
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:57,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki's wagging his finger already because he knows what I'm going to say.

51
00:03:58,173 --> 00:04:01,834
[SPEAKER_10]: SingStar on the PlayStation 3 is coming out, of course.

52
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:10,115
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people thought it was going to be something that was like a network download, but no, I think at E3 they said it was going to be a full game.

53
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:14,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it is coming on a Blu-ray disc and there's going to be HD videos on it.

54
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:16,737
[SPEAKER_10]: 30 songs on the disc.

55
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:21,758
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know exactly what 30 songs we're talking about yet, but I seem to remember E3...

56
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:26,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Survivor by Destiny's Child

57
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:53,255
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get that on the internet for all our listeners to download.

58
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:56,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Or just Bobby Blackwolf because he's Loki's only friend on the PlayStation 3.

59
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:57,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

60
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,038
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not.

61
00:04:59,478 --> 00:04:59,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's right.

62
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:00,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

63
00:05:00,238 --> 00:05:01,279
[SPEAKER_10]: You have like seven friends now.

64
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:02,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not his only friend.

65
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:02,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.

66
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,360
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not my only friend.

67
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,281
[SPEAKER_06]: You're very popular.

68
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

69
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:16,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, something that's kind of popular on the PC is distributed... What is it?

70
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:17,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Computing.

71
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,568
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a similar thing with Folding at Home.

72
00:05:21,107 --> 00:05:22,008
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

73
00:05:42,034 --> 00:05:43,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff to cure cancer.

74
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:53,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might have a part in curing diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Cystic Fibrosis, and many cancers.

75
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff like that.

76
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, let me write that $600 check right now.

77
00:05:57,701 --> 00:05:59,102
[SPEAKER_10]: It's for a good cause, right?

78
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

79
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:04,604
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't know.

80
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:06,125
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting.

81
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:11,067
[SPEAKER_10]: That whole, you know, distributed, I think that that website distributed net had something like that.

82
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:11,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

83
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:14,170
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very interesting concept.

84
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, as it is, the PlayStation 3 does suck a lot of power out of it.

85
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:23,254
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if this was something on the Wii, I could have it in standby and it would do this.

86
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:26,035
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Wii Connect 24 for you, huh?

87
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:36,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I really want my PlayStation 3, this giant screensaver on an HDTV, just sitting there all day long, even if it was for a good cause.

88
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that shit.

89
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,342
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be calculating what the winning lotto numbers are for me.

90
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:44,024
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the kind of computing I want to see the PlayStation 3 doing.

91
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:49,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to see, you know, it earning money to pay for itself.

92
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:50,748
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it should be doing.

93
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:52,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Go out and get a job, PlayStation 3.

94
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Go out and wash some dishes somewhere.

95
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:58,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Get a job cooking french fries someplace.

96
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:03,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Work the streets if you have to.

97
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:04,107
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

98
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:05,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Just help me pay the rent, PlayStation 3.

99
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Pimp that Blu-ray.

100
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:08,448
[SPEAKER_04]: $600, make you holler.

101
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:11,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

102
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:12,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, make you holler.

103
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:18,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did I spend $600 on this goddamn Blu-ray player?

104
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:18,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

105
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:28,894
[SPEAKER_04]: In other news regarding the player itself, the 1.6 firmware update for PS3 has a remote play function, so you can...

106
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:37,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring up any audio, video, photo stored on the PS3 using your PSP.

107
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:41,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, just anywhere you can find an internet connection.

108
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:43,314
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool.

109
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:47,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn.

110
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:49,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Mighty porn, mighty porn, porn, porn.

111
00:07:49,956 --> 00:07:50,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

112
00:07:52,878 --> 00:07:59,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, anytime you talk about sharing photos and movies and all that stuff, I can't help but think of porn.

113
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:02,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that so wrong?

114
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:10,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I also can't help but think of Killzone on the PlayStation 3 coming out in July.

115
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:12,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, there's a lot of other things I can think of.

116
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:13,733
[SPEAKER_10]: I just needed to transition.

117
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:16,354
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

118
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:17,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, go ahead.

119
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:26,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anyway, Phil Harrison revealed some footage of Killzone on the PlayStation 3, of course, at Game Developers Conference.

120
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:28,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it was...

121
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:41,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess one of those things where the feedback from the journalists was not so hot, so they didn't end up showing it at the full Sony conference, even though folks were reporting they could see it on the screen, like in the PS3, they didn't play it.

122
00:08:41,502 --> 00:08:42,382
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a tease thing.

123
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:49,725
[SPEAKER_10]: But according to IGN, the game will, I guess, come out in July.

124
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:53,106
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not coming out in July, the demo will come out in July.

125
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:54,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

126
00:08:54,987 --> 00:08:57,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the game itself is nowhere near done.

127
00:08:57,907 --> 00:09:01,750
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll probably see it at E3 or something like that.

128
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:03,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

129
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:11,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Another game that we can be looking forward to pretty soon, well, a few months off at least, but Grand Theft Auto 4.

130
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:17,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is thought, the rumor is that it's going to be set in a New York City setting.

131
00:09:18,444 --> 00:09:24,970
[SPEAKER_06]: And this rumor comes from a couple of people that have been

132
00:09:25,994 --> 00:09:54,380
[SPEAKER_06]: um contracted to come up with New York City themed music for the game so um you know possibly hinting that a New York City type theme if I were to guess I would say it's Liberty City because that's supposed to be New York City anyways so I don't know I would think Liberty City all over again is where it's going to be but whatever they could surprise us and have a real you know city in there either way it's um

133
00:09:55,574 --> 00:10:03,399
[SPEAKER_06]: The game's not expected out until October, however, the first ever trailer of the game will be available March 29th.

134
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,761
[SPEAKER_06]: And I cannot wait.

135
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:08,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And it better not suck.

136
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:13,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the previous Grand Theft Auto game you could fly planes at some point, right?

137
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:14,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

138
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:22,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, now, isn't putting the thing in New York City, look, I'm trying not to be wrong here, but just, you know, thinking aloud here.

139
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:34,042
[SPEAKER_10]: By putting Grand Theft Auto in a town very similar to New York City, doesn't that kind of open it up for folks at home to do some really unpolitically correct things in their game?

140
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:35,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Y'all know what I'm talking about.

141
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:39,866
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have to say it, but you know kids across America are going to try to imitate it.

142
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:45,977
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can already, to be honest, you can't fly 747s or whatever.

143
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:47,778
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't fly giant jet planes.

144
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:53,959
[SPEAKER_06]: You can fly biplanes and stuff like that into, you know, towers or make, you know, jets and stuff like that.

145
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, if you want to do that now, go buy San Andreas because you can do that right now.

146
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,121
[SPEAKER_06]: San Andreas was funny because you'd be driving along on a motorcycle and then all of a sudden a plane would crash into you.

147
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:06,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So random plane crashes are kind of fun in that game too.

148
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:08,469
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

149
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:34,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Tack Johnson is going to have his ego all over this crap with another lawsuit.

150
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:34,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put it this way.

151
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:43,013
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can have Sex with the Hooker in a jet flying towards a building and then set a nuclear explosion off that wipes out the entire city, that would be awesome.

152
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:47,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody seems to agree here that it's going to take place in future.

153
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:50,879
[SPEAKER_10]: A, it's not really New York City.

154
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:59,286
[SPEAKER_10]: B, even if it was modeled after New York City a lot, it would be a future New York City where that landmark I was previously referring to would be removed.

155
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,202
[SPEAKER_10]: But, still.

156
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:03,784
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I don't know.

157
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:09,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't help but think, you know, if they might put something in there where folks would be able to make it look like that.

158
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,171
[SPEAKER_06]: All that would happen is you crash into the building and your plane explodes.

159
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:15,613
[SPEAKER_06]: The building does not explode or fall apart.

160
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:17,455
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all that would happen.

161
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:20,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your plane would explode and people would be like, Ha!

162
00:12:20,337 --> 00:12:20,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like 9-11!

163
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:24,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you would, you know, get it out of your system and you'd go back to playing the damn game.

164
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you'd be like me and do it a few more times until you got it out of your system and then... But can you not see...

165
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:41,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Tack Johnson in a courtroom playing this footage telling the judge how Rockstar is evil and they're Al-Qaeda sympathizers and the game should be banned from the market forever.

166
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,860
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

167
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, hold on.

168
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,401
[SPEAKER_06]: You're expecting him to actually show footage of the game.

169
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:52,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he's trying to sue them now about games that haven't even come out yet that he doesn't know anything about other than that they are making a game.

170
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:53,703
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an idiot.

171
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:54,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's it.

172
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:55,664
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not talking about it anymore.

173
00:12:55,744 --> 00:12:55,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Done.

174
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:58,665
[SPEAKER_04]: He Who Shall Not Be Named

175
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:26,588
[SPEAKER_04]: We should send him one of the pink PS2s that are out in Australia on the 15th.

176
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:31,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you mean over at... I had to censor myself.

177
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what you mean, my arch-nemesis?

178
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,470
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was actually... Well, he's not necessarily an arch-nemesis.

179
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,110
[SPEAKER_04]: He's more like a lackey.

180
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:40,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, anyway, sorry.

181
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:42,351
[SPEAKER_04]: He would be like Toad is to Magneto.

182
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

183
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:47,152
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was referring to He Who Shall Not Be Named.

184
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:49,203
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

185
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:28,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, I swear to God, I am sick and tired of hearing about Warhawk and whether it's going to be on a fucking disc or downloadable title.

186
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:36,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, because of that, during Game Developers Conference, because this is back when they said, okay, downloadable only title, great.

187
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, some people are a little bit pissed off.

188
00:14:39,814 --> 00:14:46,618
[SPEAKER_06]: A few people left the actual development team because, you know, they were frustrated like this and basically saying, you know, crap product will sell like crap.

189
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:50,535
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's on the shelf or not.

190
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:52,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of my take on this thing.

191
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:54,819
[SPEAKER_06]: The game looked okay, but you know what?

192
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:01,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't give a shit about whether it's on a disc, it's on the PlayStation Network, or both.

193
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:07,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Just release the damn game, because I swear to God, the longer it takes this game to come out, the worse it seems to get.

194
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,031
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that is it.

195
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:10,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done with Warhawk.

196
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:18,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I will never read another story about the game coming out on disc or on the network.

197
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:19,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Or at all.

198
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:24,047
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, why are we bothered putting together an outline if you're just going to skip my stories?

199
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:26,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

200
00:15:28,268 --> 00:15:28,908
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's fine.

201
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:31,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't we talk about it last week anyway?

202
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:32,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

203
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,889
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation 3 is getting episodic games.

204
00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:35,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares?

205
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:38,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I remember us having a conversation about this last week.

206
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:41,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Who has put together successfully an episodic franchise

207
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:43,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Except for Sam and Max.

208
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:47,516
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the only one I can think of in the past little while that's been successful.

209
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:49,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care about episodic games.

210
00:15:49,438 --> 00:15:50,919
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why they're doing episodic games?

211
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,882
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because they go, cha-ching, cha-ching, oh, I can make some more money off this shit.

212
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:55,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

213
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:58,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, let's put some more episodic content out there.

214
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:01,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the last stuff's done so well so far.

215
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:05,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Flaming Bozo in chat room says, Grand Theft Auto 4 is going episodic.

216
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:09,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Has added content, but it has a full game before it.

217
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:09,974
Hmm.

218
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:12,788
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura will put some hand sanitizing rubber gloves on

219
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:45,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Dive into the mailbag and pull out her favorite emails and her least favorite emails to read here on the air.

220
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:47,656
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can't send average emails because they don't get read.

221
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:48,137
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

222
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:53,178
[SPEAKER_10]: We try to read as many as we can, but since, you know, we're so popular and all.

223
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:54,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, right.

224
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,119
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but sometimes we just get too many.

225
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:58,920
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't read them here on the program.

226
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,320
[SPEAKER_10]: But DarkSakura does read them all.

227
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes.

228
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:03,401
[SPEAKER_10]: I read most of them, too, actually.

229
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:09,143
[SPEAKER_10]: So unless you're a spammer, then do not actually send us email because we're banning IPs.

230
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:11,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's open up the mailbag, shall we?

231
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:19,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we have three.

232
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear LLR, I recently got a new gaming machine and thought I'd send in a review.

233
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:26,679
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple weeks ago, I bought myself a shiny Commodore 128.

234
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:39,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been wanting to play a 64 for some time largely due to the opinions expressed on your fine show, but eventually the used market prices dropped on the 128 model and I decided that it was worth a dollar to get a newer machine.

235
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:40,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure glad I did.

236
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:41,927
[SPEAKER_04]: What, Rob?

237
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:46,047
[SPEAKER_10]: I love whoever wrote this already.

238
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:46,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Finish it.

239
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:47,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Just read the whole thing.

240
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:48,949
[SPEAKER_10]: This is beautiful.

241
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:55,194
[SPEAKER_04]: So having lesser system specs, the C128 still holds up well feature-wise against other consoles on the market.

242
00:17:55,234 --> 00:18:04,520
[SPEAKER_04]: It offers backwards compatibility just like each of the major consoles on the market and even supports homebrew just like modified PSPs do, which so far only Microsoft seems to be interested in with their consoles.

243
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:11,886
[SPEAKER_04]: The C128 offers more buttons than any current console and it is available in a stylish off-put color similar to the DS Lite, Xbox 360, and

244
00:18:12,706 --> 00:18:14,347
[SPEAKER_04]: and Wii, although somewhat less glossy.

245
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:18,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, it still lacks some of the features of the other consoles.

246
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:26,315
[SPEAKER_04]: The 128 does not currently support HD output, but it is not believed that Commodore will be addressing that problem through firmware or otherwise.

247
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:40,144
[SPEAKER_04]: The command mode basic interpreter is also a little bit more difficult to use than, say, channels on the Wii, where everything is laid out for you and you just point at what you want instead of typing load, quote, asterisk, quote, uh,

248
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:45,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Comma 8 and cursing whenever you hit the wrong key or the file list is longer than one screen.

249
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:48,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that for freaking Lode Runner.

250
00:18:49,747 --> 00:19:01,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, and while there are very few C128 games, backwards compatibility means that I can enjoy any C64 game I can get my hands on, of which there are many.

251
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:10,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you know the discs haven't disintegrated over the last two decades, which I understand is a problem, I cannot seem to get Impossible Mission or The Last Ninja to work.

252
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:13,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I even tried blowing into them, but no such luck.

253
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:20,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, however, I find the Commodore 128 to be a fine addition to my game console lineup, and I intend to have many more hours of fun with it.

254
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:21,679
[SPEAKER_04]: By right sucks, Warrior Bob.

255
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:26,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, Warrior Bob, I want to have your baby.

256
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:27,801
[SPEAKER_10]: That was an awesome email.

257
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:35,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine, we could have a little house full of little VIC-20s and Plus 4s and 16s running around everywhere.

258
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:36,985
[SPEAKER_10]: That email was beautiful.

259
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:38,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he also sends another email to you.

260
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:39,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

261
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:40,467
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a rock star.

262
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:42,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we're so going to get it on.

263
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:44,433
[SPEAKER_10]: with our Commodore.

264
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:55,738
[SPEAKER_10]: We should do some Commodore live gaming and we could play... God, what the hell could you play over the modem on the Commodore 64 on my 300 baud modem that plugged into the back of the Commodore 64?

265
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:57,619
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of games could I play?

266
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,940
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess over the local bulletin board systems.

267
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,001
[SPEAKER_10]: God, no, not even... Even then, I didn't really hit until I had an IBM.

268
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:06,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Was there anything you could play over the modem on the Commodore 64?

269
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:08,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Surely we had a modem for some reason.

270
00:20:08,803 --> 00:20:10,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd play a whole shitload of kicks.

271
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:11,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe there was.

272
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Kix was my game.

273
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,137
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get together and play some Kix.

274
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:18,619
[SPEAKER_04]: The last email comes from... Wait, you said three emails.

275
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the second one was also from Warrior Bob.

276
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:20,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

277
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,321
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's from Philly Girl.

278
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:24,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Orange Lounge.

279
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:27,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you are the best podcast ever.

280
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:30,885
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know how much I appreciate you guys, but onto what I'm emailing you.

281
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:32,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a dirty joke for you.

282
00:20:33,726 --> 00:20:37,848
[SPEAKER_04]: What's six to eight inches long, goes in and out of your mouth, and leaves the white stuff around your lips?

283
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:38,368
[SPEAKER_10]: A penis.

284
00:20:38,388 --> 00:20:38,648
[SPEAKER_10]: A toothbrush.

285
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:39,749
[SPEAKER_04]: A toothbrush.

286
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:41,244
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

287
00:20:41,304 --> 00:20:43,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already signed up on your website because you guys are so great.

288
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:45,848
[SPEAKER_04]: My screen name is VanityAngel from DDR.

289
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:47,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for putting this on the show.

290
00:20:52,514 --> 00:20:54,636
[SPEAKER_10]: The email had nothing to do with video games.

291
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:57,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody just emailed us going, hey, I want to tell you a dirty joke.

292
00:20:57,598 --> 00:20:57,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much.

293
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,361
[SPEAKER_10]: God, I love our listeners.

294
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:03,123
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, that's even better.

295
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:07,326
[SPEAKER_06]: What you need to do is call our Skype line or our...

296
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:08,813
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR

297
00:21:37,091 --> 00:22:06,342
[SPEAKER_10]: UK sorry you guys are screwed you gotta you're Australia you guys gotta use the regular Skype method of doing it Orange Lounge Radio on Skype that's a beautiful idea if they're video game jokes that's even better I would love to hear some really more points if it's video game themed like Dirty Princess Peach jokes that would be great this is also great and it has nothing to do with porn or emails or any of that wow there really wasn't that many emails this week that's kind of sad I cry yeah aww

298
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:09,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at orangeonstrider.com Send us more stuff.

299
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,008
[SPEAKER_10]: This is great.

300
00:22:11,828 --> 00:22:12,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, great news.

301
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:18,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Vivendi is looking to actually revive Sierra.

302
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:26,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this is great news because Vivendi, you know, years ago, they bought out Sierra or whatever and they're offshoot Sierra online.

303
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:33,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it looks like Vivendi is going to be reviving Sierra somewhat.

304
00:22:34,093 --> 00:22:35,214
[SPEAKER_10]: The Vendy CEO Bruce Hack

305
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:58,592
[SPEAKER_10]: The revival of the Sierra brand comes from product.

306
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:05,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Over time, as our products become better and establish themselves as perennial franchises, the name Sierra will be given a stronger life.

307
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:11,655
[SPEAKER_10]: As we move forward, our products get stronger, and as they are established as franchises, the name Sierra will be strengthened.

308
00:23:13,156 --> 00:23:15,937
[SPEAKER_10]: No news yet, though, on a new Police Quest game, which kind of makes me sad.

309
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:16,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Or Leisure Suit Larry.

310
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:20,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess, then again, Leisure Suit Larry went somewhere else, right?

311
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:22,772
[SPEAKER_06]: He went to a dirty, dirty place.

312
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:47,534
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

313
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:44,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Sam and Max and it will be available in August of 2007 comments in the chat room on the last story sorry to deviate a little bit but some interesting things on Sierra James Patrick in chat says please Sierra is dead Sierra Studios were in the Sierra Mountains that studio is closed therefore Sierra the real Sierra is dead and the adventure company is the one bringing it over here to the United States so

314
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Sam & Max, and I don't know why I haven't played it yet.

315
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:54,875
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, Sierra and Sam & Max have nothing to do with each other, but I was... Well, the chat room's a little bit behind.

316
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:56,796
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a little bit of live lag, so there you have it.

317
00:25:01,158 --> 00:25:03,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I had a complete and utter brain fart.

318
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:03,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

319
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,340
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened?

320
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you daydreaming during the show?

321
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:06,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what's going on?

322
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:11,504
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I did my Reiki class today, so I've been sort of out of it.

323
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe me and Captain America can run off and have a family together.

324
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:24,188
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pursue my massage therapy and he can have a successful business as a crime fighter.

325
00:25:25,289 --> 00:25:28,031
[SPEAKER_01]: What the fuck?

326
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:28,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so how about a story?

327
00:25:28,952 --> 00:25:30,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to see that in a comic.

328
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:31,473
[SPEAKER_10]: How about a story?

329
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:35,476
[SPEAKER_10]: No, how about more Jamie and Captain America slash fanfic?

330
00:25:40,965 --> 00:25:42,806
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll name our family the Avengers.

331
00:25:42,947 --> 00:25:46,389
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the custom license plate we'll have on our minivan.

332
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I please see this posted on fanfic.net or whatever that site is?

333
00:25:50,932 --> 00:26:01,780
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because anyone who writes any fanfiction at all involving any characterization of me will be sued for libel or something.

334
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,701
[SPEAKER_10]: No sense of humor.

335
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:04,562
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have no sense of humor because it was stupid.

336
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:08,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Then make a character named Sark Dakara.

337
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:10,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see it now.

338
00:26:10,973 --> 00:26:15,397
[SPEAKER_06]: They're barbecuing on a Weber grill that's painted to look like the Captain America shield.

339
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:16,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

340
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,081
[SPEAKER_04]: That was stupid.

341
00:26:19,821 --> 00:26:24,485
[SPEAKER_10]: So how about the next... Hey, you're the one that had a brain fart and derailed the show.

342
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:27,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

343
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:28,909
[SPEAKER_04]: No pie for you.

344
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:29,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to get you pie.

345
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:31,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, story.

346
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:33,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, um...

347
00:26:34,958 --> 00:26:48,564
[SPEAKER_04]: For anyone who likes their MMOs, Turbine is offering the former subscribers of the Dungeons & Dragons online game a free weekend of gaming, actually, which is over right now.

348
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:54,727
[SPEAKER_04]: But for those in Europe, you're going to get an additional bonus for 10 days.

349
00:26:56,608 --> 00:26:57,808
[SPEAKER_04]: of Free Gaming.

350
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:02,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can enjoy their Module 3.3.

351
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to beef up their character stuff.

352
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:20,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, for those who are currently subscribed, you will get 50% more experience and a plus one to loot found and lots of live events.

353
00:27:20,693 --> 00:27:23,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically they're saying, we don't want to go out of business.

354
00:27:24,214 --> 00:27:24,874
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

355
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:52,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty, well, changing gears completely here, talking about, well, maybe, I don't know, maybe they'll show D&D online at this, who knows, but of course, the E for All Expo is being held October 18th through the 21st at the LA Convention Center, which is where E3 used to be, and of course, E for All is supposed to be kind of like that public version of E3, but we're not sure exactly how much like E3 it's going to be, because part of us are

356
00:27:53,342 --> 00:27:54,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo and Sony were traditionally in the West Hall.

357
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:27,125
[SPEAKER_10]: So therefore, we know that Sony and Nintendo's boost will be a little bit smaller than what we know from E3 past.

358
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:33,711
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, the fact that they are going really gives a boost, I think, in some regards to the E for All Expo.

359
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:38,435
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to go, hey, it's only $100, but the tickets are not currently on sale.

360
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:41,017
[SPEAKER_10]: They will be made available in the future, I guess.

361
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:46,701
[SPEAKER_10]: But certainly, Sony and Nintendo signing on does really help out this new show.

362
00:28:47,022 --> 00:28:47,762
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see what happens.

363
00:28:48,523 --> 00:28:49,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Will they be using Kensha Hall?

364
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,620
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be fun.

365
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:54,822
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll probably have a gun show going on in Kenshiya Hall while this is going on.

366
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:55,962
[SPEAKER_10]: No, seriously.

367
00:28:57,422 --> 00:29:00,243
[SPEAKER_10]: One time... No, for real.

368
00:29:00,463 --> 00:29:08,006
[SPEAKER_10]: One year I went to the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention in Las Vegas, which is at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

369
00:29:08,066 --> 00:29:13,267
[SPEAKER_10]: We had the right side of the building for the costume contest, the live speakers, because they had people from the movie there and everything.

370
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:16,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the left side was a gun show.

371
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:17,909
[SPEAKER_10]: So you had

372
00:29:18,683 --> 00:29:33,970
[SPEAKER_10]: People in fishnets and full, you know, doctor, for those that have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about, like full Dr. Frankenfurter garb and, you know, little Columbia's and sequined outfits and, you know, people just basically dressed like fucking freaks intermingling with the gun show people.

373
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:39,353
[SPEAKER_10]: And the most hilarious part was that the ATM was in the gun show room.

374
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:48,017
[SPEAKER_10]: So if any rocky people wanted money to buy their crap, they had to actually go into the gun show and get pointed at and stared at by the folks there.

375
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Guns Next To Games Just What He Who Shall Not Be Named Once

376
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:29,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so there's a brand new game coming out now that's probably one of those serious games that will help kids deal with the complex emotions surrounding marriage or divorce in this case.

377
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:31,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Earthquake and Zipland

378
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:01,608
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

379
00:31:02,288 --> 00:31:03,589
[SPEAKER_06]: No way you can fix a marriage.

380
00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:06,630
[SPEAKER_06]: You might as well throw yourself into the ocean and die.

381
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, does the game tell you that, too?

382
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,570
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really pleasant.

383
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,091
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but that's where I took from it.

384
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I could be wrong, but, you know.

385
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:14,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

386
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:16,992
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, I'm not a 12-year-old that's played this game.

387
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:19,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm neither of those.

388
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:24,294
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, do you think we need a game to help kids understand divorce?

389
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:28,175
[SPEAKER_04]: No, people just shouldn't get married.

390
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,696
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have an expo.

391
00:31:29,716 --> 00:31:30,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, think about it.

392
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:43,750
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was no marriage, none at all, and everybody had a common law deal, then there wouldn't be a problem.

393
00:31:45,211 --> 00:31:49,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, Daddy decided that he and Mommy were going to break up, so he just moved out.

394
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:51,078
[SPEAKER_04]: No problems.

395
00:31:52,725 --> 00:31:58,151
[SPEAKER_06]: They should find out that the reason that the island split in two is because the king was having sex with some other chick.

396
00:31:58,192 --> 00:31:59,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Daddy's moving in with Uncle Bob.

397
00:32:03,998 --> 00:32:10,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally, I basically, my parents were divorced before I had any memory of them being married.

398
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:11,427
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

399
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:20,586
[SPEAKER_04]: From that point of view, I couldn't really say if a game would help with that, because I just always grew up understanding what divorce was.

400
00:32:20,846 --> 00:32:23,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, my parents have been together ever since I was born.

401
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:31,594
[SPEAKER_10]: They were together for like 15 years before I was born, and they're still together today, and I need a game to help me understand why they're still together after all these years.

402
00:32:32,015 --> 00:32:39,341
[SPEAKER_04]: What I don't get is why people who obviously hate each other's fucking guts, Oh, we're staying together for the kids.

403
00:32:39,421 --> 00:32:42,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, you're giving them a fucking complex because you hate each other.

404
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does Mommy and Daddy fight?

405
00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:46,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do they hate each other?

406
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,654
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd all be happier if you'd just go ahead and get a divorce.

407
00:32:50,014 --> 00:32:51,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm sure we'll be getting some emails on that one.

408
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:53,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag.

409
00:32:53,676 --> 00:32:55,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe in staying together for the children.

410
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:58,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe in giving the children a healthier environment to exist in.

411
00:32:59,278 --> 00:32:59,618
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

412
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:02,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we'll see what kind of Pandora's box that comment opens.

413
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:05,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up just fine with my divorced parents, okay?

414
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:06,661
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

415
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:07,322
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see what happens.

416
00:33:07,762 --> 00:33:08,022
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

417
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:08,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

418
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,575
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

419
00:33:35,856 --> 00:33:37,556
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not giving it the proper context.

420
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:42,598
[SPEAKER_10]: You heard about it from me on a radio program a couple years ago.

421
00:33:42,998 --> 00:33:44,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Just play me my damn music.

422
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:45,858
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go run and hide.

423
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:58,501
[SPEAKER_04]: The website of the week, again, is one that Rob mentioned a long time ago.

424
00:34:01,702 --> 00:34:02,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Mantis.net Mantis.net

425
00:34:05,885 --> 00:34:06,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

426
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:09,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Mantis are panties made for men.

427
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're frilly and lacy.

428
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:14,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can get them high cut.

429
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,314
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get briefs.

430
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:21,659
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can get nylon or lace.

431
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have all kinds of designs.

432
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:25,962
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have seven day ones.

433
00:34:26,603 --> 00:34:28,104
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're really pretty.

434
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:32,228
[SPEAKER_04]: And plus they're made spacious in the front for special needs of men.

435
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:33,529
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

436
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:54,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, if you want to be pretty, if you feel like being a little dressier than usual, you should go to mantis.net Chat room, the answer to your question is no.

437
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:57,253
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be no.

438
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:00,997
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so wrong.

439
00:35:02,678 --> 00:35:03,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel dirty.

440
00:35:06,912 --> 00:35:11,775
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can still feel dirty, yet pretty underneath, and no one knows but you.

441
00:35:13,936 --> 00:35:14,856
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great idea.

442
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:20,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm looking at the embroidered ones, and they have hearts on them or balloons.

443
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:24,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, PowerShop Pinball Constructors coming out for the Nintendo DS.

444
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:28,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Oxygen Games just announced this coming out very soon.

445
00:35:29,912 --> 00:35:46,441
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, cause Metroid Prime Pinball did pretty well, so here we go, Pinball, Powershot Pinball Constructor So I guess it sounds like you can make your own table in this game, which sounds kinda cool, yeah, it has a table editor in it And of course that makes me think of Pinball Construction Set on the Commodore 64 Pinball's fucking awesome!

446
00:35:46,841 --> 00:35:55,466
[SPEAKER_10]: So now you can make your own table, so that means if I wanted to make a table of nothing but like 50 bumpers, I could do that Do you remember the Hyperball machine though?

447
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:57,667
[SPEAKER_04]: All it was was nothing but multiball

448
00:35:58,411 --> 00:35:59,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I don't remember that.

449
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,272
[SPEAKER_04]: It would just shoot out a bunch of balls and you'd have to shoot them back down on the thing.

450
00:36:01,812 --> 00:36:06,174
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, if I want to build pinball machines, I just get Dan to buy one and fix it for me.

451
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:12,336
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, now you can do it all in the palm of your hand on the DS.

452
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:12,837
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

453
00:36:13,977 --> 00:36:23,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so Zelda co-creator Eiji Aonuma, I guess, Aonuma, confirmed in an interview with Game Informer

454
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:32,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Phantom Hourglass for the DS will feature in online multiplayer mode.

455
00:36:32,945 --> 00:36:42,051
[SPEAKER_06]: And they didn't really say what it's going to feature, but he did answer yes when they asked if there's going to be online battles over the Nintendo Wi-Fi service.

456
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:45,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's interesting, I guess.

457
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:48,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, I'm thinking it's going to be something like Four Swords, maybe?

458
00:36:49,596 --> 00:36:50,196
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be kind of neat.

459
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:51,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

460
00:36:52,078 --> 00:36:52,758
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be pretty cool.

461
00:36:54,526 --> 00:36:56,427
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 Swords was actually a really, really cool game.

462
00:36:56,447 --> 00:37:00,168
[SPEAKER_10]: 4 Swords was a much fun game, like on the GameCube.

463
00:37:00,188 --> 00:37:01,188
[SPEAKER_10]: That game was awesome.

464
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:07,209
[SPEAKER_10]: When you could find people that had the advances and the chords to play the damn game with, it was a fun game.

465
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:14,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I heard... Now, I can't remember... Correct me if I'm wrong, because I never played 4 Swords Adventure or something like that.

466
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:16,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it have an online mode or something where someone...

467
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:20,162
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like a couple Triforces on the map or something like that.

468
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:26,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we talked about this maybe last week, where you basically drew a path that this warrior thing follows or something.

469
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:30,946
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the multiplayer in the Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

470
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:31,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

471
00:37:31,907 --> 00:37:32,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

472
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:36,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that was Bobby telling us about him playing it at GDC.

473
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:37,129
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

474
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:37,869
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what he was saying.

475
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,229
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we were hanging out with him last week.

476
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:43,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, anyways, so as Bobby was telling us from GDC, it's basically...

477
00:37:43,715 --> 00:37:53,359
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a couple Triforces on the map, and you can't, I think, see the player if they have a Triforce or don't have a Triforce, something like that.

478
00:37:53,779 --> 00:38:00,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically, one player controls, there's three guards, and you draw a path that they follow, and stuff like that.

479
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:01,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sounds interesting.

480
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:07,005
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like that Pac-Man multiplayer game that was on the GameCube.

481
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:10,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Pac-Man Versus, which they so need on the Wii and online.

482
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:16,588
[SPEAKER_10]: or on Xbox Live then, because if Nintendo's not going to do it, then fucking put Pac-Man vs. on Xbox Live.

483
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:20,389
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we should have gotten instead of old school Pac-Man, but that's just my opinion.

484
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

485
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,350
[SPEAKER_10]: What do I know?

486
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:24,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Rob.

487
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:25,751
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you know?

488
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:27,331
[SPEAKER_04]: How about some stuff?

489
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I know stuff.

490
00:38:29,112 --> 00:38:31,392
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a little bit of information, though.

491
00:38:31,552 --> 00:38:33,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I'm not visiting your website of the week this week.

492
00:38:36,754 --> 00:38:36,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

493
00:38:37,294 --> 00:38:37,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?

494
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:47,008
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is an unholy union between In The Groove and Pump It Up.

495
00:38:47,788 --> 00:38:51,630
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like they got together after taking a lot of LSD and bread.

496
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:55,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So now there's a Pump It Up Pro.

497
00:38:57,634 --> 00:38:57,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

498
00:38:58,555 --> 00:38:59,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say anything else about that.

499
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:01,997
[SPEAKER_10]: God, where do I begin?

500
00:39:02,017 --> 00:39:02,037
[SPEAKER_10]: A.

501
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:09,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Those of you that were saying that In The Groove was going to somehow be absorbed into Konami and Dance Dance Revolution No!

502
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:11,199
[SPEAKER_10]: It was going to have In The Groove songs, no.

503
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,484
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's further proof that that ain't happening because it's been absorbed into Pump It Up, it looks like.

504
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:21,129
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much all the songs that were done by Kyle Warder now on Pump It Up, that's about it.

505
00:39:21,696 --> 00:39:25,179
[SPEAKER_10]: So, in other words, Andamiro threw a bunch of money at Kyle Ward, and that's it?

506
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:30,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Andamiro... But Andamiro and Roxor had, I guess, a working relationship, right?

507
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:35,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Because those In The Groove 2 cabinets, of which I've still never seen one in my entire life, were... Well, wait.

508
00:39:35,847 --> 00:39:36,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I take that back.

509
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:40,832
[SPEAKER_10]: There might have been one at that 8 on the Break place in Jersey when I went there a long time ago.

510
00:39:40,872 --> 00:39:41,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't remember.

511
00:39:41,392 --> 00:39:44,575
[SPEAKER_10]: But regardless, Andamiro made those cabinets for him, right?

512
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:45,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

513
00:39:46,216 --> 00:39:46,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.

514
00:39:46,956 --> 00:39:47,257
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

515
00:39:48,115 --> 00:39:50,257
[SPEAKER_10]: They already had a little bit of a working relationship.

516
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:52,598
[SPEAKER_10]: So this actually doesn't surprise me so much.

517
00:39:52,979 --> 00:40:02,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're going to see songs like, for example, Oasis, as well as... There's a bunch of other stuff I recognized on there when I was watching the videos of them.

518
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:10,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Exotica, Esperanza, let's see here, Destiny.

519
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:14,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a bunch of songs, I think, from In The Groove that were in there, so...

520
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:17,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong, I like some of Kyle Ward's songs.

521
00:40:17,964 --> 00:40:21,487
[SPEAKER_10]: I really like the stuff he does under, was it Banzai is the name?

522
00:40:21,827 --> 00:40:24,949
[SPEAKER_10]: The Zodiac and Anubis and all those songs.

523
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:26,210
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, I don't know.

524
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,653
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just weird.

525
00:40:30,213 --> 00:40:32,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Miklatov wanted to come on the show tonight, but he had to leave.

526
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:34,697
[SPEAKER_10]: I know he's a hardcore Pump It Up fan.

527
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,258
[SPEAKER_10]: He ain't happy about this.

528
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:40,982
[SPEAKER_10]: He does not like the In The Groove thing crossing over to Pump It Up.

529
00:40:41,002 --> 00:40:42,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's really crossing over.

530
00:40:42,563 --> 00:40:45,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's more of just they have him now as an artist.

531
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:45,713
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

532
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:47,633
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's taking his songs with him.

533
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:51,394
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the guy's got to work, so whatever.

534
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:54,815
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't necessarily mean he's just, you know, it's in the groove now.

535
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:58,435
[SPEAKER_06]: They did, I like what they've done with the interface.

536
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:01,376
[SPEAKER_06]: The interface is not retarded as it usually is on Pump.

537
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:02,816
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of nice.

538
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:06,997
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, I don't really think it's in the groove.

539
00:41:07,057 --> 00:41:10,878
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that it's got, you know, Kyle Ward doing music for him.

540
00:41:12,698 --> 00:41:12,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

541
00:41:13,837 --> 00:41:14,498
[SPEAKER_10]: In the group, DDR, right.

542
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:14,799
[SPEAKER_10]: All righty.

543
00:41:26,055 --> 00:41:33,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, if you would like to call us, we're going to open up the Skype line here very shortly because we encourage your interaction here on this program as well.

544
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:41,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and our 800 number if you want to call us that way, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

545
00:41:41,686 --> 00:41:44,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like we have some Ain't On The Break fans or folks that live near there.

546
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:46,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Blaze says, Ain't On The Break for the win.

547
00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:48,291
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR Dollar Bill says, yeah, Ain't On The Break.

548
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:51,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Rama says, Sky, that was a beta in the Groove 2.

549
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:54,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Chinatown Fair has in the Groove 2 and a Pump It Up box.

550
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:56,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been to Ant on the Break.

551
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,830
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say I've been there a couple times, actually.

552
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:02,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I went out there once randomly when I was in the East Coast.

553
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:04,851
[SPEAKER_10]: I went there again for some DDR tournament.

554
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:12,252
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played some game that was some beat game I'd never seen in my life.

555
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:13,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember, sorry.

556
00:42:14,353 --> 00:42:14,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

557
00:42:16,193 --> 00:42:17,514
[SPEAKER_10]: ShadowCharlie wants to know what happened.

558
00:42:17,554 --> 00:42:22,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of Zodiac, what happened to the Zodiac remix that Loki made that was during the bonus segment of last week's show?

559
00:42:22,495 --> 00:42:24,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Check his community page on all games.

560
00:42:24,355 --> 00:42:24,675
[SPEAKER_10]: It's there.

561
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,593
[SPEAKER_10]: and apparently 8 on the Break has two in the group, two machines now.

562
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:29,134
[SPEAKER_10]: There you have it.

563
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:33,876
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's go ahead and head on over to the Skype line and start taking some calls.

564
00:42:34,676 --> 00:42:35,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

565
00:42:35,977 --> 00:42:36,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

566
00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:38,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Raven Stolfen.

567
00:42:38,758 --> 00:42:39,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me turn down the thing.

568
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:40,619
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

569
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:41,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Raven Stolfen.

570
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:42,179
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

571
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a podcast now.

572
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,341
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a podcast now?

573
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:48,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

574
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:48,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

575
00:42:48,982 --> 00:42:51,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody and their fucking mom has a podcast now.

576
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Why should we listen to yours?

577
00:42:53,763 --> 00:42:55,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he's a tech podcast guy.

578
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:56,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Something different.

579
00:42:57,025 --> 00:42:58,526
[SPEAKER_10]: A tech podcast.

580
00:42:58,966 --> 00:43:00,628
[SPEAKER_10]: This week in Raven's Dolphin?

581
00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:02,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of.

582
00:43:02,889 --> 00:43:03,489
[SPEAKER_10]: What's it called?

583
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,331
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Raven's Tech Review.

584
00:43:06,532 --> 00:43:06,792
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

585
00:43:06,872 --> 00:43:09,153
[SPEAKER_10]: And where can we access Raven's Tech Review?

586
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:11,175
[SPEAKER_03]: On the All Games Forum.

587
00:43:11,575 --> 00:43:13,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's being submitted to iTunes soon.

588
00:43:13,796 --> 00:43:14,517
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be up there.

589
00:43:14,817 --> 00:43:15,077
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

590
00:43:15,097 --> 00:43:15,397
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

591
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:17,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully coming soon to the iTunes store.

592
00:43:17,979 --> 00:43:19,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Raven, talk games with us.

593
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we don't... Well, I mean, we do talk tech, but we talk video games.

594
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:23,723
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think of some of our stories tonight?

595
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:28,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're interesting, but you're missing one more, and I viewed it on my site.

596
00:43:28,682 --> 00:43:29,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

597
00:43:29,743 --> 00:43:32,144
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Commodore computer coming back.

598
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,347
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about it last week.

599
00:43:35,367 --> 00:43:38,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we did.

600
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:40,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's all right.

601
00:43:40,931 --> 00:43:47,835
[SPEAKER_10]: As a tech-inclined individual, what do you think of Commodore making a comeback in the competing with Alienware or something market?

602
00:43:48,956 --> 00:43:49,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's interesting.

603
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:53,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's going to be an operating system.

604
00:43:53,596 --> 00:43:56,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you remember the Commodore had a different operating system than the DOS.

605
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:57,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

606
00:43:57,841 --> 00:43:59,362
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what they're going to do.

607
00:43:59,482 --> 00:44:06,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's going to be Commodore just placed in there with a Windows operating system, or they're going to go with something different.

608
00:44:07,891 --> 00:44:14,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Something tells me, since Commodore Basic is very antiquated, I think you're going to just get a normal Windows PC in there.

609
00:44:17,107 --> 00:44:18,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just interesting about that.

610
00:44:18,688 --> 00:44:24,572
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll tell you, I'm not going to miss syntax error one bit or load, quote, star, quote, comma, eight, comma, one.

611
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:25,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I ain't going to miss that shit.

612
00:44:27,574 --> 00:44:29,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't miss it at all, but two more things.

613
00:44:29,995 --> 00:44:32,197
[SPEAKER_10]: The fuck did comma, eight, comma, one mean anyway?

614
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:33,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea.

615
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:34,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Two more things.

616
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:36,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just their command line.

617
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was like the device number or something.

618
00:44:38,621 --> 00:44:40,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, why was the disk drive eight?

619
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:41,123
[SPEAKER_10]: It was always eight.

620
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:43,485
[SPEAKER_10]: I think like once in a blue moon you might have seven.

621
00:44:44,385 --> 00:44:45,546
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, sorry.

622
00:44:47,942 --> 00:44:50,244
[SPEAKER_10]: This would be This Week in Raven from 1984.

623
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:52,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, what else?

624
00:44:52,626 --> 00:44:53,667
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you have to listen to it.

625
00:44:53,687 --> 00:44:54,968
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, what else is on your mind, Raven?

626
00:44:55,668 --> 00:44:56,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Two more things on my mind.

627
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:58,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Vampire for the Commodore 64.

628
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:01,192
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever play Vampire?

629
00:45:02,393 --> 00:45:05,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm familiar with the title, but I can't remember the gameplay.

630
00:45:05,856 --> 00:45:06,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun game.

631
00:45:07,017 --> 00:45:07,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on GameTap.

632
00:45:07,978 --> 00:45:09,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, I think it's on GameTap.

633
00:45:09,238 --> 00:45:09,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's where I've seen it.

634
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:10,700
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not played it.

635
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:12,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

636
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:13,362
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you do in Vampire?

637
00:45:13,382 --> 00:45:13,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Last thing.

638
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,098
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't say you're a vampire.

639
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:17,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not a vampire.

640
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:19,039
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I meant in the game.

641
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:21,519
[SPEAKER_03]: This one goes to DarkSakura.

642
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:22,820
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

643
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Flintstones Pinball.

644
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:25,980
[SPEAKER_03]: You ever heard of it?

645
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:28,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

646
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:29,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I was very interested in it.

647
00:45:29,801 --> 00:45:31,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it based off the movie?

648
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:32,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was.

649
00:45:32,402 --> 00:45:39,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I played that table once, and because it was the movie, it felt like I felt unclean after playing it.

650
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:42,804
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had to go change out of my mantis.

651
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:48,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, bye Raven's Dolphin, take care.

652
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:57,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can always call us on the Skype line, Orange Lounge Radio.

653
00:45:58,557 --> 00:46:01,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go to the phones and take another call.

654
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:03,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

655
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:09,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you three guesses and the first letters are J-A-N-S.

656
00:46:10,483 --> 00:46:11,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's Jazz.

657
00:46:11,703 --> 00:46:13,604
[SPEAKER_10]: God, you haven't been on the show in a long time.

658
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:15,045
[SPEAKER_10]: No, hi Jason, what's on your mind?

659
00:46:15,745 --> 00:46:17,786
[SPEAKER_07]: You fail at spelling, Rob.

660
00:46:17,907 --> 00:46:18,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeez.

661
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:23,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. VXJasonXV himself, our webmaster extraordinaire.

662
00:46:24,831 --> 00:46:26,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Extraordinarily extraordinary.

663
00:46:26,272 --> 00:46:35,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, VX, our website held up amongst being on the front page of Dig and Joystick and Kotaku and all that stuff, Destructoid and all that this week.

664
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:36,940
[SPEAKER_10]: So, good job.

665
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Really good to know.

666
00:46:38,741 --> 00:46:40,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I've kept looking and I've kept checking.

667
00:46:40,482 --> 00:46:41,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw when you guys...

668
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:42,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumor noise up, Sal.

669
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love a new Space Quest game.

670
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,391
[SPEAKER_10]: I would absolutely love it.

671
00:46:45,411 --> 00:46:45,891
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

672
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:46,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Haven't kept up.

673
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I just heard it, and I thought it was cool.

674
00:46:49,451 --> 00:46:49,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Six.

675
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:12,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, so there were that many games in the Space Quest series?

676
00:47:12,982 --> 00:47:15,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I always thought there was only like the three or four that were in it.

677
00:47:15,111 --> 00:47:15,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

678
00:47:16,808 --> 00:47:26,612
[SPEAKER_07]: There was, the first four were all the keyboard navigational, the fifth actually introduced the mouse, and then the sixth actually introduced the announcer, and even more interactivity.

679
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:28,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Five was awesome, that's the first one I played.

680
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:37,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I got the anthology and played the old ones, and then I played six, and I was blown away, because it was a big difference, and it was so good.

681
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:39,478
[SPEAKER_07]: For the kids today...

682
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:47,577
[SPEAKER_10]: What makes this game so freaking great?

683
00:47:49,057 --> 00:47:49,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Humor.

684
00:47:50,678 --> 00:47:52,218
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to read, but it's all in the humor.

685
00:47:52,918 --> 00:47:54,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a great puzzle game.

686
00:47:55,379 --> 00:47:55,699
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

687
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:58,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

688
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah?

689
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:03,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just saying, I mean, that's the best part about it.

690
00:48:03,082 --> 00:48:04,482
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a funny game.

691
00:48:04,642 --> 00:48:05,482
[SPEAKER_07]: It is very witty.

692
00:48:05,902 --> 00:48:06,703
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to read.

693
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:09,023
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a game that puts you through a book adventure.

694
00:48:09,664 --> 00:48:10,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And I loved it.

695
00:48:10,744 --> 00:48:11,024
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

696
00:48:11,482 --> 00:48:16,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I beat Turtles Arcade at 5 o'clock in the morning Were you by yourself or did you have a bunch of other people?

697
00:48:36,053 --> 00:48:36,833
[SPEAKER_10]: I was by myself.

698
00:48:37,093 --> 00:48:39,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but you get unlimited continues by yourself.

699
00:48:40,195 --> 00:48:41,675
[SPEAKER_10]: How many continues did you have to use?

700
00:48:43,036 --> 00:48:43,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I don't even know.

701
00:48:44,997 --> 00:48:47,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Call me back and brag when it's three or less, buddy.

702
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:50,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, just teasing.

703
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:51,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

704
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,140
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fine.

705
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,522
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, actually, there's a YouTube I saw somewhere of a guy running through the entire game on one credit.

706
00:48:58,742 --> 00:48:59,422
[SPEAKER_10]: It was amazing.

707
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:02,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how anyone does it.

708
00:49:04,036 --> 00:49:06,858
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people claim about, you know, single credit arcade runs.

709
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:10,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know I don't have any game I could say I've done such a thing with.

710
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:11,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Me neither.

711
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:12,982
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

712
00:49:13,843 --> 00:49:14,443
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Jason.

713
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:16,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thanks for all you do for us.

714
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,925
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls.

715
00:49:17,965 --> 00:49:18,245
[SPEAKER_10]: All righty?

716
00:49:19,246 --> 00:49:19,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

717
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:19,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

718
00:49:21,307 --> 00:49:21,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good night.

719
00:49:22,028 --> 00:49:22,328
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

720
00:49:22,868 --> 00:49:23,249
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

721
00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:25,690
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

722
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, it's your show too.

723
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,812
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to hear what you guys have to say.

724
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:32,775
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's go to another call here on the Skype line.

725
00:49:33,223 --> 00:49:34,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

726
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:34,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

727
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:37,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, this is Dark Shy.

728
00:49:37,885 --> 00:49:38,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Dark Shy?

729
00:49:40,206 --> 00:49:40,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

730
00:49:40,946 --> 00:49:41,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, Dark Shy.

731
00:49:41,547 --> 00:49:42,447
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind, my friend?

732
00:49:42,467 --> 00:49:45,228
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I want to say it's kind of amazing.

733
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:46,509
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the first time on the air.

734
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:49,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, I don't recognize your name as calling in before.

735
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,011
[SPEAKER_10]: I know your name from chat, but you've never called in before.

736
00:49:52,051 --> 00:49:52,891
[SPEAKER_10]: So, welcome, noob.

737
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:55,873
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

738
00:49:56,353 --> 00:50:01,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, first off, I just saw 300 today, and I heard of a game coming out.

739
00:50:03,977 --> 00:50:08,240
[SPEAKER_05]: And my friends all, so I saw like, oh, it should be on PS3.

740
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,241
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so amazing it deserves to be on PS3.

741
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,322
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've never heard of it.

742
00:50:12,462 --> 00:50:13,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, what?

743
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:19,126
[SPEAKER_10]: It does sound a little bit like a fanboy's wet dream, such as Kill Bill, the game.

744
00:50:19,707 --> 00:50:23,069
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's any game that's slated to come out, Loki would know about it.

745
00:50:23,389 --> 00:50:23,069
300?

746
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:24,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they really making a game out of 300?

747
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they did a PSP game.

748
00:50:27,011 --> 00:50:28,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't very good.

749
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:31,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking... Did he not get his PSP and his PS3 confused, maybe?

750
00:50:57,873 --> 00:51:02,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I told him that he said it deserves to be on PS3.

751
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:05,416
[SPEAKER_05]: He's saying, like, oh, it's so amazing.

752
00:51:06,216 --> 00:51:09,257
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, the PS3 wasn't all that great, so...

753
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,400
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

754
00:51:42,101 --> 00:51:48,723
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be possible you get another game or two out of this a little later on down the line, especially with the movie being as popular as it is.

755
00:51:50,344 --> 00:51:51,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

756
00:51:51,804 --> 00:51:52,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one more thing.

757
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:53,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, what's up?

758
00:51:55,285 --> 00:52:07,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I remember so many years ago about hearing about Phantom Hourglass, and it just came out now, or coming out now, and I'm like, is this like a tradition for the Zelda games or something?

759
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:07,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

760
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:07,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

761
00:52:09,005 --> 00:52:10,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much, sadly.

762
00:52:10,185 --> 00:52:13,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the Phantom Hourglass, they debuted at what?

763
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:17,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't they first show that off at E305, I almost want to say?

764
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:19,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it was E306.

765
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:24,469
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was either E306 or it was either that or Tokyo Game Show or something like that.

766
00:52:24,649 --> 00:52:26,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it has been a long time.

767
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:28,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's pretty much tradition for the Zelda series at this point.

768
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:32,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, except the CD-i ones came out pretty quickly.

769
00:52:35,212 --> 00:52:35,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

770
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:36,613
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

771
00:52:37,475 --> 00:52:39,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, are you looking forward to Phantom Hourglass?

772
00:52:40,617 --> 00:52:43,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm a big fan of Zelda.

773
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,682
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of the multiplayer mode we were talking about?

774
00:52:47,742 --> 00:52:49,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think it's going to be fun on the internet?

775
00:52:51,184 --> 00:52:56,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping so, because I can't really think of Zelda online, so maybe they'll surprise me.

776
00:52:57,988 --> 00:53:04,392
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard to think about Nintendo online these days, but yeah, I mean, Zelda's definitely a step in the right direction, so we'll see.

777
00:53:05,773 --> 00:53:06,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

778
00:53:06,574 --> 00:53:06,794
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

779
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:09,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, DarkSakura, thanks so much for the call, and call again sometime, all right?

780
00:53:11,204 --> 00:53:11,504
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

781
00:53:11,864 --> 00:53:12,184
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

782
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:17,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun with Phantom Hourglass and all those hours you're going to be putting into that.

783
00:53:17,686 --> 00:53:18,046
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

784
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:20,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

785
00:53:20,608 --> 00:53:22,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to those folks that did not get through.

786
00:53:22,648 --> 00:53:23,569
[SPEAKER_10]: We apologize.

787
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:26,570
[SPEAKER_10]: But everybody's trying to hammer the line there, so it happens.

788
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:27,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

789
00:53:28,011 --> 00:53:34,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to the chat room, trying to read the comments there to some of those previous calls we took.

790
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:37,649
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100 Matt says, I hear the 300 game is awful.

791
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:41,931
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 says, bring on the max 300 jokes.

792
00:53:43,612 --> 00:53:47,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, SSJ100 Matt says, you could have 302 electric boogaloo.

793
00:53:49,514 --> 00:53:50,315
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, there you have it.

794
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:53,056
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll take more calls next week.

795
00:53:53,076 --> 00:53:56,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, again, Loki's Challenge to leave us a dirty joke on the Skype line.

796
00:53:56,757 --> 00:53:58,958
[SPEAKER_10]: That's open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

797
00:53:58,998 --> 00:54:00,159
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do that all week long.

798
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:05,374
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to go around and see if there's any last minute stories anybody would like to share tonight.

799
00:54:05,494 --> 00:54:06,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Last minute stories.

800
00:54:08,937 --> 00:54:12,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying to find the information on it, but I can't actually find it.

801
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,464
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually a new pinball table coming out later this year that's a Monty Python theme.

802
00:54:20,106 --> 00:54:21,227
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're actually going to get it.

803
00:54:21,387 --> 00:54:22,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a Spamalot table?

804
00:54:23,128 --> 00:54:25,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's Spamalot, because there's already a Holy Grail table.

805
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:28,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that they were either going to do Meaning of Life or Life of Brian.

806
00:54:28,893 --> 00:54:29,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's Meaning of Life.

807
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:31,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's pretty cool.

808
00:54:32,785 --> 00:54:34,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Always look on the bright side.

809
00:54:34,787 --> 00:54:35,808
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Life of Brian.

810
00:54:35,868 --> 00:54:37,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know, but, you know.

811
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:43,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Meaning of Life had, um... Had, um... The, uh... It's just a waifu thin mint.

812
00:54:45,656 --> 00:54:48,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't the Meaning of Life the one that was in, like, the office building in the beginning?

813
00:54:49,759 --> 00:54:54,243
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually a different... It was supposed to be a lot shorter.

814
00:54:55,063 --> 00:54:57,505
[SPEAKER_04]: But, unfortunately, they let Terry Gilliam have his way.

815
00:54:58,166 --> 00:54:59,567
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was the, uh...

816
00:55:01,072 --> 00:55:01,772
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

817
00:55:02,072 --> 00:55:03,933
[SPEAKER_04]: The Crimson something assurance.

818
00:55:04,293 --> 00:55:05,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that scene going on forever.

819
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:06,693
[SPEAKER_04]: With all the tax preparers.

820
00:55:06,953 --> 00:55:08,453
[SPEAKER_10]: All forever a scene went on.

821
00:55:08,494 --> 00:55:09,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that scene.

822
00:55:09,594 --> 00:55:09,894
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

823
00:55:10,314 --> 00:55:10,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow.

824
00:55:10,734 --> 00:55:13,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it great to charge your own accountant?

825
00:55:13,975 --> 00:55:14,495
[SPEAKER_04]: That one.

826
00:55:15,835 --> 00:55:22,476
[SPEAKER_10]: TheRobD says about the Amani Python table, every time you hit a bumper, I fart in your general direction every time you hit a bumper.

827
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:24,457
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cute.

828
00:55:24,517 --> 00:55:26,797
[SPEAKER_10]: LegendZaku says, and now for something completely different.

829
00:55:28,206 --> 00:55:29,387
[SPEAKER_10]: and Monty Python Pinball Table.

830
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:30,968
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good name for a table.

831
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:32,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, anything from you?

832
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:34,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple small things.

833
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:40,313
[SPEAKER_06]: One, Splatterhouse is confirmed apparently for Virtual Console this Monday.

834
00:55:41,753 --> 00:55:43,014
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to be seeing that.

835
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:48,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to tell you right now, Splatterhouse is one of those games you're going to think back to your childhood and go, this game was awesome.

836
00:55:48,837 --> 00:55:52,319
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you all download it on Monday, the game was not that good.

837
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:53,680
[SPEAKER_10]: It really wasn't.

838
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember how bad it was.

839
00:55:56,435 --> 00:55:57,376
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still funny though.

840
00:55:57,936 --> 00:56:02,659
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want that Friday the 13th vibe to it, there you go.

841
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:04,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what else here.

842
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:11,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, apparently it started now on the PlayStation 3 on one of the previous firmwares.

843
00:56:11,964 --> 00:56:16,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Up until 1.51, they're seeing holes and they've exploited a TIFF exploit.

844
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:28,512
[SPEAKER_06]: basically causing a buffer overflow like they did on the PSP to run their own code.

845
00:56:28,932 --> 00:56:36,536
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's only a matter of time before they break the PlayStation 3 and have piracy rampant on there as well as homebrew and stuff.

846
00:56:36,616 --> 00:56:39,318
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm waiting.

847
00:56:41,479 --> 00:56:41,779
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

848
00:56:42,299 --> 00:56:42,599
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

849
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:47,121
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't have anything either, so I guess we're here to the end of the show.

850
00:56:47,662 --> 00:56:48,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's it.

851
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,400
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

852
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,841
[SPEAKER_10]: We're finishing pretty fucking early.

853
00:56:51,861 --> 00:56:53,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is a short show tonight.

854
00:56:54,001 --> 00:56:57,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of weird for us, but that's okay.

855
00:56:57,482 --> 00:56:58,242
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a, you know, compact and

856
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:17,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Good show.

857
00:57:17,432 --> 00:57:18,234
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of information.

858
00:57:18,274 --> 00:57:21,380
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about a lot in Part A and Part B. We'll do it all again next week.

859
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,667
[SPEAKER_10]: In the meantime, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting Independent.

860
00:57:25,106 --> 00:57:25,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Internet Radio.

861
00:57:25,867 --> 00:57:30,611
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys are awesome, and it's because of you we continue to do this show every week in and week out.

862
00:57:30,931 --> 00:57:36,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio, March the 25th, for episode number 225.

863
00:57:37,077 --> 00:57:38,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that like a landmark number?

864
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:40,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's like, you know, multiple 25?

865
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:42,142
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

866
00:57:42,282 --> 00:57:42,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Not so much.

867
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:43,143
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

868
00:57:43,163 --> 00:57:44,324
[SPEAKER_10]: 250 maybe.

869
00:57:44,344 --> 00:57:44,944
[SPEAKER_10]: 250 maybe.

870
00:57:44,964 --> 00:57:47,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Or our five-year birthday is just around the corner.

871
00:57:47,927 --> 00:57:49,589
[SPEAKER_10]: I say we get a stripper for the fifth birthday.

872
00:57:49,629 --> 00:57:49,929
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

873
00:57:50,575 --> 00:57:52,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyhow, in the meantime, that's it for this week.
