00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And we are back on Orange Lounge Radio here with part B of our podcast or audio blog, audio cast, whatever you want to call it.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's the audio archive of our program and it's split up into two parts.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Part A is released usually early, early Monday morning, late Sunday night, however you want to look at it.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Part B comes out sometime on Wednesday whenever we get around to uploading it.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But this is the second half of a continuing show that is taped live on Sunday nights.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And if you feel like coming down for a show, you should join us.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
www.orangeloungeradio.com, we have a chat room, hi chat room.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And you missed our great bonus segment and things you can only hear live or on our rebroadcast at allgames.com.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We were playing porn or game and the sound effects were either from a porno or from a game.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It was awesome.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And we didn't do that well.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We only got 8 out of 10 I think.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So that was a B.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Jamie and I played together.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It was hot.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
B for boobs.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Alright, anyhow.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Back into the news.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Starting off this segment with some pretty big news.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It has to do with the Halo 3 beta.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Rumor is that the Halo 3 beta is going to be split into two sessions.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The first session will begin on March 21st.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Seems pretty bold that these predictions are naming dates.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But this is from Xbox Portugal who also brought the first Halo 3 beta screenshots.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The first session will only be for those that got emails from Bungie.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That starts March 21st.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The second session will be also open to those who bought Crackdown.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That will end in June but no start date given for that yet.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But Loki, you were telling me during the break you heard this is bullshit.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, I heard it's bullshit.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How was it proven wrong?

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I think it was either someone at Microsoft or someone at Bungie that said that it would just be one giant session.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That they weren't going to do two different ones.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well there you have it.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So Xbox Portugal lies.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Maybe not.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Miscommunications or you know.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, Loki said Halo 3 would be coming out in the spring which was also a lie.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So there you have it.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's alright, it happens.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Lies.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You should be ashamed.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Something though that actually is pretty cool.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
As announced in OXM, the Halo theme is going to be a downloadable track for Guitar Hero 2.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think that's pretty cool.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's definitely going to be something that I think is going to get a lot of people to look more into those downloaded tracks.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's going to be something that's going to make a little bit of revenue so why not.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It'll be cool.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hey here it's going to be free.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Which makes sense.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I like free.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And yeah it would be a good promotion for the Halo 3 game.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What I also want to know though is can Master Chief be one of the guitarists that you can play as.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That would be cool.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That would be awesome.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Because it was pretty awesome to have Master Chief in Dead or Alive 4.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well it wasn't Master Chief.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Spartan.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Female Spartan.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Whatever.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You know having a Halo character in the game was kind of funny.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mistress Chief.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Sorry.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
My bad.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Mistress Chief.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That would be Chieftess.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Anyway.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So yes.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
One of my favorite topics of discussion is how people are hacking firmwares on consoles.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
One very famous group, Team Executor, one of the ones I think pioneered some of the homebrew stuff on the PSP.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Have broken the firmware for the Xbox 360.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now, right now there's apparently a, and they can't disclose too much, but there is a glitch in one of the older firmwares for the 360 that will allow you to use a copy of King Kong to run your own code.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Kind of similar to what they're doing with some of the older firmwares on the PSP where you could run homebrew with Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Apparently one of the shaders I guess that was in King Kong was actually unsigned and so they could buffer overflow it and cause it to run their own stuff.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And they actually released a proof of concept I think like Hello World or something like that that you can run on your 360 if you happen to have this firmware.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And apparently there's a way to check it by going to your system menu and stuff like that.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But like I said, if you're getting your automatic updates on live like most people are, you probably have already patched the hole in this because the problem has been patched in some of the future firmwares.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Basically right now there's no way to roll back the firmware kind of like you can do on the PSP.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Although if you have the older firmware there is apparently a thing you can break on the motherboard or something that you can do that will allow you to be able to roll it back no matter what firmware you have later on.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Can Microsoft just patch this right away?

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They can.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They're pretty good.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Of all the companies they're the fastest at closing up these loopholes real quick.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
At least on the 360 not so much Windows XP.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And right now really I don't think there's a way you can really detect this because it's being run in a game almost.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's loading with a game so unless they just ban the use of King Kong altogether it's going to be pretty hard for them to stop it altogether.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't know though.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But they've already pretty much done.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
They've patched the hole for this.

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So I don't know there's not too much else I guess they can do right now about it.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But anyways as I was going to say the first proof of concept they've got out there and this was I believe on QJNet was shown.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
At least they linked to it.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can't remember what it was.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I think it's just a hello world type thing.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah hello world pretty much.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is some unsigned code.

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So that's kind of interesting it's I guess the Hypervisor vulnerability.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's found in kernel versions 4532 and 4548.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So apparently if you pull up your Xbox 360 under the system menu and look up system information.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There's a little thing on the bottom of the screen that says D and then there's a bunch of numbers and then K and a bunch of numbers.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If your kernel says 2.0 point and then the either the 40 or the what was it the 4532 4548 so yeah.

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's kind of cool though.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I mean got to start small and then they're just going to blow it up.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But the rumor is also Team Executor is going to be releasing a actual PS3 thing that's going to launch ISO's off the hard drive once the European launch happens.

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So hopefully we'll see some more like that because I can't afford these expensive games.

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh yes because the rampant piracy will certainly make the games even better.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That was sarcasm.

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hasn't hurt the PS2 any more or the PSP.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well there are some franchises that every so often will rear their ugly heads in over the course of video gaming history.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well Ubisoft has released information on the new Prince of Persia game for the Xbox 360.

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Apparently it's going back to the roots of the game with more jumping around and grabbing stuff and climbing and things.

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And the prince is going to have a gauntlet instead of a knife.

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So it will be not so stabby oriented.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
God.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Prince of Persia not so stabby.

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I was never a fan of the Prince of Persia game so I'm like wow.

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They're not bad. The new ones aren't bad.

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't think they're quite like oh my god as a lot of people said they are but I played some of the older ones on GameTap.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They're not bad.

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
For a 3D action type game they're pretty solid.

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It was a pretty good game and I don't know.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can see why it does as well.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They have the one coming off the Wii, the port of two thrones I guess but Rival swords they call it something new because they added some chariot racing in there.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If you like Prince of Persia that's going to be a pretty cool game to check out.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Another cool thing about Prince of Persia is it's becoming a movie as well.

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Disney is behind this as well as Jerry Brockheimer.

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They're bringing Prince of Persia the Sands of Time and it is legit.

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
They've got some concept art on it.

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's pretty cool.

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Didn't Disney already put out Aladdin?

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes.

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I think it would be a pretty cool action movie.

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm looking forward to it.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Just don't fuck it up.

140
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If they pull it off you might have a really good movie translation for a game.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's been lacking lately.

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Jamie, you're not a fan of the game but would the movie perk your interest?

143
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Maybe it would work as a movie.

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No.

145
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That was very definitive. Why not?

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Just not your thing?

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The Arabian Nights thing not your thing?

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I've seen Aladdin and I watched the Sinbad movie back in the day when it was a tiny color.

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well shit.

150
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Anyway, of course you can download movies on iTunes and you can download music.

151
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
For those wondering where's all the gaming music?

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Electronic Arts has launched the EA Tracks service as a part of iTunes.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Basically what they've done is they've compiled all the EA games.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The interesting thing is they've said music from all EA games past and present now available on the iTunes store.

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Well, okay, but when you say all EA games past and present that makes me go wow.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You mean I could even go to the ECA games from the Commodore 64 days?

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
No.

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Basically what that means is your burnouts, your sports games with the licensed music, the Madden's.

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Any of the games with EA Tracks.

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If you've got those EA Tracks you can download those songs on iTunes so there you go.

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Did you know that Burnout Dominator is supposed to have Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend in it?

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Which, oh boy, that's a pretty bad song.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I like the last one she did for the movie.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But.

165
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This song's bad.

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But.

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's not something I would want the EA name on.

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Would it make you want to crash into things?

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's a very good point.

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's true that there's pedestrians in the next Burnout game.

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It would make me want to run over them.

172
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Dominator would not have pedestrians.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Dammit.

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Dominator is kind of a best of built off the Revenge Engine I believe.

175
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Well we have our own Revenge Engine built into Orange Lounge Radio and that is our mailbag.

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
When you guys don't like something you heard on the show, or you know when you like something you heard on the show.

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can send us an email to mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
and DarkSakura will open up the email bag and pull out some of her favorite emails to read here live on the program.

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And I believe this week we got a lot of emails didn't we DarkSakura?

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Uh yeah but I picked only a few.

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So please don't be offended if your email is not read on air because some, you know it's weird.

182
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Some weeks we get nothing, some week we get a bunch.

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
There's a few I'd like to go back and repost.

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Probably on Tuesday I'll have them up on the site as well as the one from last week.

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Alright well let's play the cute little theme music so we can get into the emails that you did select for this week.

186
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The first email of the week without the sexy commentary actually comes from...

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Email number one.

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Hey Rob shut up.

189
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Um comes from uh Heon. Uh dear OLR first of all I absolutely love the show you guys are excellent radio show hosts and are very talented.

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you so much for making the show so fun by interacting with your audience.

191
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Onto my questions Super Mario Brothers Ocarina of Time, Kid Icarus, A Link to the Past.

192
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
These are just several of the classics that are currently available on the North American Virtual Console.

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's been only four months.

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The Wii still has four to five years to go.

195
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
At this rate they're going to be scraping the bottom of the barrel near the end of its life.

196
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I know that Nintendo's got a significant amount of masterpieces still to release on Virtual Console.

197
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But are they going too fast?

198
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Sincerely Heon.

199
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
P.S. Um I am now a Pastafarian thanks to the show.

200
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
FSM loves.

201
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Flying Spaghetti Monster.

202
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Wow.

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I fear the day that Marissa has influence on anyone.

204
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Um.

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
All hail his noodly goodness.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Love you Marissa.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Anyhow actually I actually.

208
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
She'll be up here in two weeks.

209
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
She's coming back.

210
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
A lot sooner than we thought so that's going to be a very interesting program.

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Anyhow.

212
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Back to the content of the email.

213
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Um.

214
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What was the email about again?

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
About if Nintendo's releasing whatever Rob.

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Virtual Console games coming out too fast or whatever's going on.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Um.

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Right now.

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
No.

220
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I mean keep in mind what we were talking about earlier in the program.

221
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That there's this big drought going on with the games.

222
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And although Reggie Fils-Aime lied and said we wouldn't have these droughts this time around.

223
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Keep in mind one thing he did say is that the Virtual Console releases, the big ones.

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Would supplement the lack of Wii games during these slow periods.

225
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So I think right now.

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No.

227
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
They're not necessarily doing the Virtual Console games too fast.

228
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I think this was probably a pretty decent time to release Ocarina and Kid Icarus and some of those really big titles people want.

229
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I think when you get into November of this year when you know some of the bigger titles start coming out.

230
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Hopefully your Mario Galaxy.

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Probably your Metroid and so on and so on.

232
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Um.

233
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're probably going to see the Virtual Console releases get very slowed up.

234
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Maybe you'll get one new game a week.

235
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
From some obscure title.

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Like we're starting to see.

237
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You have to admit now on the TurboGrafx-16 and Genesis side.

238
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We're really starting to dip into the obscure games coming out on Virtual Console.

239
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I've never even heard of a lot of those games coming out.

240
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Um.

241
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Especially but if they're going to open up the door to Commodore 64.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
As I believe the rumor had said before that Commodore 64 is a possibility coming.

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And as well as MSX and so on.

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Especially if they blow up in that Commodore 64 door.

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That is going to be a shitload of games that they can add there as well.

246
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I guess it would depend on what publishers.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Um.

248
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I think there's still a lot of room for Virtual Console to go.

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Uh.

250
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And hopefully someday we'll start getting the multiplayer add-ons.

251
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Maybe some of our games will be enabled for multiplayer slowly but surely.

252
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Maybe we'll get our cheat codes.

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I could see that as something that happens slowly but surely in 2008.

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I want Icarus to fight Medusa Angels.

255
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And I want my Justin Bailey in Metroid.

256
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
And hopefully originals too.

257
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Don't we want some Wii originals?

258
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Some more original Wii games?

259
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Heck yeah.

260
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That would be hopefully where the console goes in 2008 and 2009.

261
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So we will see what happens.

262
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Next email is very special.

263
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Dear OLR crew, my name is Rama from Indonesia.

264
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I am a classic video game lover.

265
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I believe that I am probably the first person from Indonesia becoming one of your loyal fans.

266
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Right now I have to know.

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm going to check stats.

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Right now I'm working as a journalist and most of my articles about technology and video games.

269
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm also working as a local video game music composer.

270
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
One thing that will probably surprise you that I am blind.

271
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I was born with only 10% sight ability after being operated.

272
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Now how can I operate a computer?

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm using screen reader that enables me to read object shown on my laptop so I can read and write,

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
browse the internet, and even download your show.

275
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
When I was a child I was so interested in video games because it had attractive sounds and graphics.

276
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I even owned an Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, NES, Genesis, and SNES.

277
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
With only 10% sight I could still enjoy classic games.

278
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I could not recognize objects or details, but I could still understand, for instance,

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
which one is my hero and which one is the enemy.

280
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I even finished many famous classic games such as Super Mario series, Contra, Gradius,

281
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Sonic series, and many more.

282
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But when 3D gaming era came out, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Saturn,

283
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I decided to give up because I could not play games with so many movements.

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
After that I decided to enjoy video games in other fashions.

285
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I started to record or collect music from games I played.

286
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'll share with you some of my listening later.

287
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So now on to my comments about you guys.

288
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Scroll down.

289
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, I could not say a word but awesome.

290
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Your podcast is the first experience enjoying video games news on an audio forum.

291
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I actually found your site last January and started to become your fan.

292
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I even quoted some of your information in my articles.

293
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Sky Logie and DarkSakura, you are the craziest gang I have ever loved.

294
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I feel like having lots of friends video game folks that refreshes my energy and brain during the working hour.

295
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You should know that not many Indonesians have intention to talk about video games that much.

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And man, your other soldiers are awesome too.

297
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I suggest that you go on this way and besides video games, bring along more laughter and joy.

298
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh, that's so sweet. There's more.

299
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Wow.

300
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Those are reasons I keep downloading your show even though Indonesian internet connection is like a turtle crawling along the beach.

301
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That requires more than 12 hours to download your A and B segment.

302
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But that's fine as I can enjoy your show.

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't know if this one will ever interest you but have you ever tried audio games?

304
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This is another genre of gaming which was built specifically for the blind so they can play games too.

305
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
There are many kinds of games such as card games with voice, chess and even more advanced platforms like RPG, spaceship battle games.

306
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It takes advantage of stereo sound systems.

307
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
For example, if you're playing spaceship battle game and your enemy is on your left,

308
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
you can hear their ship on your left speaker and can shoot them.

309
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You can also chase them if they dodge your attack.

310
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's say they move from left to right.

311
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm going to scroll down.

312
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Again, pay attention to the speaker.

313
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And it did something like that with that Atari controller that you use your forehead to play.

314
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And Sega did a couple of audio only games on the Saturn.

315
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You can try them here. It's at audiogames.net.

316
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I wonder if it can be Dark Sakura Side of the Week.

317
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We'll see.

318
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Well, I think that's all I can share.

319
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I hope I keep in touch with you guys.

320
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This email can be read on air.

321
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
As for joining your show via Skype, I think it is difficult because the connection, like I've mentioned before, is very slow to make such a call.

322
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Plus the time difference.

323
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Lastly, I'm working on an Xbox 360 project along with a local game developer at max-studio.net to produce independent games.

324
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Well, I don't really know about the program, but I heard that Microsoft is holding a contest for XNA Game Engine to produce games for 360.

325
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So I hope I can do well.

326
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Good luck for you guys.

327
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I will probably make an interview and write more about your show later.

328
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
P.S. I love Chicken Shoot.

329
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's signed by Rama.

330
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I think that came up the week you weren't here, Dark Sakura.

331
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
There was a game called Chicken Shoot.

332
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Wow, what an amazing email.

333
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That was really cool.

334
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There's a lot that we take for granted sometimes, I think.

335
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Emails like this can be very humbling in a way that sometimes we take for granted our mega fast internet connections we have, our site that we have to play video games.

336
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You know what's interesting is actually this person is not the first person I've heard on a gaming podcast talk about the difficulty of being legally blind, so to speak.

337
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Just because you're legally blind doesn't mean you can't see it all.

338
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Like this guy said, he has 10% vision.

339
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It makes perfect sense for things that are 2D with minimal movement going on to be much easier to see than our 3D games.

340
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I imagine that actually it might even be easier to see the smaller sprites, the collection of sprites as they'll have a cleaner color palette than even things moving around in life.

341
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We take our vision for granted, just all the things that go on around us but the moment that it's gone.

342
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's actually a good thing that I think is really neat about this audio game.

343
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This goes back to my love of the Discovery Channel.

344
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:43,000
They were talking about how they had a group of blind people riding their bicycle down the road using clicking to determine location of cars and other things in the road.

345
00:20:43,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Their study group actually managed to avoid children running out on the road, avoided trash in the street by using their sense of hearing to determine space relation around them.

346
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:13,000
They say that if you lose one capability, your other capabilities become so much more sensitive so that really makes sense I think.

347
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'd be very curious what this listener has to think about the Wii because he does have at least the 10% sight.

348
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The Wii is interesting because it has that rumble and the speaker that's actually in the Wiimote as well as the rumble depending on where your cursor is on screen.

349
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It could help you identify if you're pointing at a certain object.

350
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I imagine not all games would work but I'm kind of curious could the Wii maybe be something that would help bring the sky back into gaming where the 3D games and the ultra-intensive graphics have made him unable to play.

351
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I would have never known about this type of sight and the way they make these games.

352
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I guess I'm just ignorant that way. I would have never known how to not pay for this email.

353
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Thank you very much for the email.

354
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm going to check that site out just because I want to know.

355
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I want to see what kind of games there are.

356
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:08,000
There have been other games and I don't think they were necessarily brought out for the blind in particular but Sega, there were a number of Saturn games that focused only on audio.

357
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
There was one game that came with a packet of seeds where you had to use the audio to raise a plant.

358
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Very interesting. Alpha Canagram reminds us and SSG100 Matt chimes in too about how Ellen actually gave a blind kid a Wii on her show.

359
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Remember that? That was some gaming news a while back.

360
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That was before the Wii's were even out. So kind of an interesting reminder there from the chat room.

361
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's why we love chat because they remember things and we don't.

362
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This next email comes from Bear Who Drive Car.

363
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I love that name.

364
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's so great. French fries, sorry.

365
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Okay, I have to stop for just a minute. Loki, what the hell is it? You have DDR fifth mix on your PSP?

366
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah.

367
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What are you hacking over there?

368
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I was putting the PS1 image on here.

369
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
God, I'm so far behind on my PlayStation. Dang, you mean if I get a card you can do that with PlayStation 1 games for my PSP?

370
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, you put a custom firmware on there and you can convert any PS1 image to play on a PSP given that you have the big enough...

371
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Now my next question for you is why the fuck do you have DDR on your PSP?

372
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So I can play with the controller. That's how I play normally.

373
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Back to the emails.

374
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Sorry.

375
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Anyway, yo, just writing to vent about the Wii. I do like it, but you guys mentioned that there are too many controllers.

376
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Well, I can't agree more.

377
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
First I got Super Mario Brothers with the Wii mode.

378
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's kind of odd because of the shape and size, but that was okay.

379
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Then I got Smash Brothers Melee and all of a sudden to play multiplayer I needed two GameCube controllers.

380
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay, not too bad.

381
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Then I bought Contra and that's when I noticed if you try to play with the GameCube controller...

382
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
No, I try to play with the GameCube controller, but if you recall the locations, the YB on SNES and Game Boy controllers are totally different.

383
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
By the way, I hate the GameCube controller and it's asymmetrically sized buttons.

384
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So now I have to buy a Wii Classic Controller, two for multiplayer.

385
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I've also purchased three Wiimotes and four Nunchucks.

386
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So Nintendo Wii $250, three Wiimotes $120, four Nunchucks $80, two GameCube controllers $40, two Wii Classic controllers $40.

387
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Spending $530 to play a glorified GameCube, priceless.

388
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Fanboys claiming the Wii is a value system cannot be more wrong.

389
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I get the point, but at the same time you didn't have to buy the controllers.

390
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You just didn't like the way it felt on the GameCube controllers.

391
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And again, you're not forced to even buy Contra or any Super Nintendo game at all.

392
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Whereas PlayStation 3, you have to buy a Blu-ray drive, like it or not.

393
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Granted, I'm comparing apples to oranges a little bit here,

394
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
but I think that's where your point kind of has a little bit of a flaw.

395
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You're saying that you feel you have to buy these to have that.

396
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And again, I don't have four Wii controllers.

397
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I probably didn't even really need to get a second one.

398
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I just did it because we usually have a lot of people over and I wanted to play Wii Tennis.

399
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But ideally, a lot of people have their own Wiimotes and so on and so on.

400
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I do get what you're saying though.

401
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
There are a lot of hidden fees, but you kind of get that with every console.

402
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
PlayStation 3 doesn't come with a component cable, if I remember right.

403
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Wasn't that something we covered on a previous show that actually didn't come with the component or HDMI cable?

404
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
PlayStation 3 only came with the other one.

405
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Xbox 360, granted their premium unit is much better than their core unit, coming with a lot of the basics.

406
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But if you want to get a wireless headset, that's more money.

407
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And I say, yeah, you kind of do need that wireless headset if I want to play DDR or so on.

408
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Anyhow, interesting point, but I think a slightly flawed one.

409
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I don't know.

410
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I think that there's something to it, but it all depends on how far you'll go for the sake of convenience.

411
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Anyway, next email comes up.

412
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Actually, granted, could I just say some quick points from chat that came up here?

413
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Let's see, what's going on?

414
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Leon wants to start a fight here.

415
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You are not good enough for the GameCube controller, you noob.

416
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And Blay says, boo-fucking-hoo, do your research before you buy a system.

417
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
So a couple of people throw in some rocks there.

418
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
SkyWarrior, that's with a Y, not an I.

419
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Says, value, what makes the Wii so compelling?

420
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Too bad the PlayStation 3 has no value as of now.

421
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Very interesting.

422
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And some interesting comments there from the chat room there.

423
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
James Patrick says, a lot of Wii games only need one remote, and you pass it around.

424
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So, kind of interesting there. Ooh, food.

425
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And also they have games coming out now like Wing Island and Koro Impa that use one remote and Nunchuck for two players.

426
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So they've got all that stuff going on.

427
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Jamie's got them out. I don't want that now after you put your mouth all over it.

428
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I only ate off one side of it.

429
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's fine. It doesn't look that good anyway.

430
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm starting South Beach tomorrow again.

431
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Anyway.

432
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
This email actually is not the last one. It comes from Nekky.

433
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Really the one thing that I wanted to go in here.

434
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And it's a really long email, and this is going to be one that I'm going to leave on the website.

435
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But I wanted to mention this.

436
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I like the idea of telling people, now you have posted a site plug for you on my home forum, dscommunity.co.uk, to plug the site for them.

437
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And Xbox 360 Fanatics link is z6.envisionfree.com slash 360 underscore fanatics slash index dot php.

438
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
We are currently quite small, but invite everyone to join no matter where you are.

439
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And that includes you, Jamie, Loki, and Rob.

440
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I wanted to do that, though, just because Nekky writes us regularly.

441
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And I'm going to be posting this in the thing, but I thought that it would be nice for me to go ahead and give the little plug.

442
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I remember the first email from the taped segment was a loving rant about the last few episodes.

443
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I do feel slightly likewise, but I agree with you, Jamie and Rob, that it does keep your show unique.

444
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Inviting Casper the Gay and Rice Princess every week may not be such a good idea, though.

445
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I do not hold anything against them, but having them on every week would alter many people's views of your show.

446
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Well, that's why these folks are guests, not hosts.

447
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Well, you said it out of love, not hate.

448
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Gotcha.

449
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Anyway, that one's going to get reposted.

450
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Sorry, I'm actually trying to do a search. I want to see where this post comes up.

451
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm looking at this site. It's dscommunity.co.uk.

452
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's a whole little DS, and I imagine there's lots of friend code training going on.

453
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Oh, here it is.

454
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
There's actually a forum called Plug a Site, and there's this post there.

455
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Great site for podcasts and live shows focusing on video gaming.

456
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Past available on iTunes, MP3 download available on actual website.

457
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Covers release dates for most of the world.

458
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Most are accurate, as they have insider sources.

459
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
One of the guys works for a game distribution company.

460
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Good fun to listen to, especially when you have nothing to do or on a commute.

461
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I like that. Orange Launch Radio, better than nothing.

462
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Yeah.

463
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
No, thank you very much for the plug.

464
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
We appreciate that.

465
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You are a true veteran of the O.L. Army, and we salute you.

466
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
We got an email from Gaming Nerd about...

467
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Nerd.

468
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Hey, now.

469
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Anyway, from Gaming Nerd, it says,

470
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Hey, O.L.R., I know this is kind of a risky subject to mention,

471
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
but I feel it must be heard so that people understand what could be happening in the future in gaming.

472
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
After listening to Loki's rant in the last week's episode about there not being any good games for PS3 and 360,

473
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and only average ones, it got me looking back at the numerous anonymous sites that I've been to.

474
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Excuse me.

475
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm finding it pretty easy to download pirated PS2 and Xbox games off the net,

476
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and bringing them to DVDRs and playing them on modded consoles.

477
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Knowing how easy it is to download PS2 and Xbox games,

478
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
it gets you wondering just how much money game companies are losing just from these two consoles.

479
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
With that loss in money,

480
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
there's only so much money that can be spent to produce average titles of the kind of graphics power

481
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and development tools that are provided for the PS3 and 360.

482
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's no wonder the Wii is overtaking the competition with its console

483
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
for the simple reason that the GameCube ran games off unique media that wasn't easily accessible to the public.

484
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Thus, more money was earned through the sales in the games for the GameCube,

485
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and money being able to produce the awesomeness that is the Wii and its games.

486
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Also, something I should point out is that Nintendo has been notorious for proprietary software

487
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
for their storage capacity.

488
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,000
This is probably one of the reasons why I think Square jumped ship with them with the Final Fantasy franchise.

489
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
It'll only be a matter of time before we see a Blu-ray burner and PS3 games get pirated.

490
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
A mod ship is released to the console, which will result in even more money lost to the companies that make their games for the PS3.

491
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm even more surprised the Japanese market isn't complaining about piracy,

492
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
but that you could only mean there's much more loyal to gaming than some of us here in the States.

493
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Especially when it comes to buying my PS2 imports, I'm more than willing to spend $64 to buy games like Puyo Puyo Fever 2,

494
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Melty Blood, DDR Supernova, BeatMania 2DX, and supporting the companies that made these games.

495
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And like most people that I've heard who just go ahead and download imports,

496
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,000
since they either can't find a store that sells them or don't want to spend an extra $14 off everyday $50 US titles,

497
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
they might have just come out.

498
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Anyways, I hope this letter gives a better understanding as to why big names aren't really as big anymore,

499
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
as it partially is due to the loss of money and loss of quality for the games themselves.

500
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I can remember when it was really big news for a game like Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo, and Final Fantasy to get new sequels,

501
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
but nowadays it's just the same thing because there isn't enough money to do much else in the games.

502
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Unique aspects are gone and there's not much else we can say about gaming other than stop the piracy and the magical return.

503
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You're truly a gaming nerd.

504
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Very often you hear from people who are willing to defend the fact that video game piracy is a bad thing.

505
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So, very interesting email.

506
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Don't copy that floppy, as a famous musician once said.

507
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Loki, I'm curious what your feedback is on this whole piracy is bad for the industry angle.

508
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Sure, it's bad for the industry, but to be honest, nowadays a lot of the stuff, if it's not worth playing,

509
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I won't even go and pirate it or anything like that. I'll just not play it.

510
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But, I mean, I guess I buy normally, I mean, I buy a lot of stuff that just comes out

511
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
and I find out, you know, the hard way that a lot of the games do suck.

512
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
So I can see where a lot of people get burned by these games that, you know, get great reviews

513
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and they're like, what the fuck? This is crap. Driver 3, for example.

514
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yeah, piracy is, especially if you make it so easy, like it is on the PlayStation 2, or even the original PlayStation,

515
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
yeah, it's going to be a huge issue, but I don't know. It's all morals.

516
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
If you think stealing is bad, then you're not going to do it, but, you know.

517
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Bandit says, bad for the industry, but good for Loki, in our chat room.

518
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
GS68 says, I buy legit copies, though I admit I've done my share of ROM downloading.

519
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I think ROMs are not quite as bad. In fact, they're really not as bad, because usually the things you're pirating ROMs of.

520
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I mean, if you're doing current DS games, that's one thing, but if you're downloading ROMs of, you know,

521
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,000
years old, you know, Commodore 64 and NES games that folks aren't going to be, you know, playing anytime soon,

522
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
or selling anytime soon, that's not as bad.

523
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,000
For the record, I have DDR5 mix at home. I just don't have a copy that'll work on my PSP.

524
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You might say Virtual Console makes ROMs bad, but I don't know. I'll admit, I've downloaded my fair share of ROMs.

525
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Charging $5 for an NES game makes Virtual Console bad.

526
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I have a ROM of Kid Icarus on my computer. I don't like to play Kid Icarus on my computer.

527
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I like to play it on my television like I did when I was a kid, so for that, it was worth the $5 to me,

528
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
because I love Kid Icarus that much.

529
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
To be honest, I've got to play PS1 games on my PSP, because what else am I going to play?

530
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Grand Theft Auto? I mean, seriously, what else is out for the PSP?

531
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
A whole lot of stuff I'm not interested in.

532
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It sounds like a lot of stuff coming soon, though.

533
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Soon. It's always coming soon.

534
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Ah, whatever, whatever.

535
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Anyway, may I read the next email?

536
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You sure may.

537
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Thank you. Last email.

538
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Hiya, guys. I just want to know what it is that we in Europe and Australia have done to piss off Sony.

539
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Whatever it was, I'm sure we could apologize.

540
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's the funny accents.

541
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
No, shut up.

542
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Maybe come to some kind of arrangement.

543
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You don't get this kind of treatment in America.

544
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
How come? Is it cash, bribes, sexual favors?

545
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm sure you know why it is I'm feeling hard done by.

546
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I was accepting of the higher price tag. We are used to that.

547
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Also, the late release date.

548
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I've only just bought my copy of Final Fantasy XII.

549
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
We're used to having to wait, but waiting longer to pay extra for an inferior piece of hardware is taking the biscuit.

550
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Full backwards compatibility.

551
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Well, there's another thing. You call it a biscuit.

552
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I mean, come on.

553
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Rob!

554
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
The expression is take the cake.

555
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, shut up.

556
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What?

557
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm just, obviously I'm kidding. Come on.

558
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Stuff it!

559
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Thank you.

560
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm going to flip Jamie off the British way. There you go.

561
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Up your arse.

562
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Hey, two fingers salute for you.

563
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You're being a real tit.

564
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Don't be such a tit.

565
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm done. I promise.

566
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
To use a bit of proper colloquialism. Rob's doing my head in here.

567
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So shall I continue?

568
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I suppose.

569
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Okay. Wanker.

570
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Full backwards compatibility was one of the biggest selling points for the PS2 for me and would have been on the PS3.

571
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Being able to play a session of San Andreas and putting on Bishi Bashi Special if mates come over without switching consoles or messing with wires is important to me.

572
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm starting to wonder whether Sony actually wants to sell any consoles over here.

573
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
PS3s are available on pre-order from every UK shop and website.

574
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:14,000
No one is worried about shortages because there are none and there is a conspicuous lack of interest in the approaching release.

575
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Is there any way of getting an import yet or have Sony still got sniffer dogs in customs?

576
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
IBOs maybe?

577
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Asiya Lee, Marketing Manager, OLR, UK Division.

578
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Oh, yes. This guy.

579
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yes.

580
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Amazing work.

581
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Bandit calls this whole thing bux.

582
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That's a bandit has to say about it.

583
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I offered you some. Don't give me that look.

584
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
What?

585
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You're looking at my cupcake and then I ate that big thing of icing.

586
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It looks like a yummy cupcake, but I don't want it.

587
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I offered you some.

588
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Cupcakes make me fat. I don't want it.

589
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
You put your fingers all over that cupcake.

590
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You haven't even like torn off the paper.

591
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You've just dived into the cupcake.

592
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I asked you if you wanted some and you said no so I started licking the ice.

593
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Don't be such a twat.

594
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You're being a real twat.

595
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Wanker.

596
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Anyway, no seriously.

597
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I think the reason why Europe gets shit on is I think they sell the least amount of consoles there.

598
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
The end.

599
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Right? Am I right?

600
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
No.

601
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Loki says I'm wrong.

602
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I would think that's what it is.

603
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I don't know.

604
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Don't they sell more consoles in Japan and America than they do in Europe?

605
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Maybe.

606
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I guess it depends what you consider to be Europe.

607
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Do you consider Europe to be everything on the other side of the Atlantic?

608
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Or do you consider Europe to be, you know...

609
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I just think that they think that their US and Japan markets are more important than their UK markets.

610
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
They want to make sure they have enough consoles for us because we're spending more money on games.

611
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I always said the TVs too because the Japan and US share the same TV format standard whereas NTSC...

612
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It doesn't matter with HD.

613
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
If Sony's really pushing the HD format then having PAL or NTSC is not going to matter.

614
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But not everybody has an HD TV yet so the systems have to work with the old TVs whether they are whoring up the HD angle or not.

615
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
That should be pretty easy to do though.

616
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Just a thought.

617
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You have to figure out what components they're going to take out of your PS3 so that they can lower the price on their end.

618
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
That's what they have to do.

619
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
All right. Well, we don't know.

620
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
That's the Sony question we've given you our thoughts though.

621
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Regardless, it's not nice that they keep giving you the shot over there on the different games.

622
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Rob.

623
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
What?

624
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm sorry. No.

625
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
The international listeners ought to know I love them.

626
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I tease because I love.

627
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
As somebody in chats, I don't even know who said this here.

628
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Who said my accents were so bad they were good?

629
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Somebody there said my accents are so bad.

630
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Oh, there it is.

631
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Sky Warrior says Sky's accents are so bad they're funny.

632
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Uni says Sky's accents are like my mom trying to do a British accent and completely miserably failing at it.

633
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Oh, goodie.

634
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Now I'm like your mom.

635
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
That's a very nice compliment.

636
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Like your mom.

637
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

638
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It's like your mom.

639
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Go leave that on an iTunes review.

640
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I want one of our British listeners to record that for us so that we can make a bumper out of it.

641
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
We need to bring back the bumpers.

642
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I missed the bumper.

643
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

644
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It's like your mom.

645
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I could do that better.

646
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I could do that better.

647
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
All right. Sorry.

648
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Forget it.

649
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
No, seriously. I could.

650
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Any more emails?

651
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
No.

652
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

653
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Send us more.

654
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Send emails. My accent wants some fan mails.

655
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
We need to do what this says.

656
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You lose because we say so.

657
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
You're just crazy.

658
00:39:47,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Apparently the rumor is much like the online libraries, they are also withholding the Mii libraries for the Nintendo Wii from third-party developers

659
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
and not letting them develop games that will utilize the Miis,

660
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:14,000
which is kind of disappointing because I would like to use my Miis in a lot more things than just Wii Sports or WarioWare, I guess.

661
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I don't see why they don't.

662
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Don't use your Miis in Grand Theft Auto.

663
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh, my God. That would be awesome.

664
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That would be so cool.

665
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Even stuff like maybe your face or something on SSX Blur or something like that.

666
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Create a character type thing.

667
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Or your mom.

668
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Literally put your mom in the game.

669
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Something like that, yeah.

670
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I don't know why they don't. I think it's stupid.

671
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But if it's anything like the online stuff was, they want to make sure they get it right first before they put it out to everybody.

672
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Which is a poor excuse if you ask me, but whatever.

673
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm sure, like the online, it will be something that's implemented later on.

674
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
While it may not be happening now, it will happen later.

675
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah, third-parties will get their Miis soon enough.

676
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Although I agree, they should have had it from the start.

677
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Well, GameTap, we mentioned in part A when I was talking about Myst online.

678
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
What should be noted is that GameTap is also now starting to really get behind the independent game movement.

679
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Seems like a really good fit for GameTap, if you ask me.

680
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Well, GameTap has announced they're going to be doing a new indie game label.

681
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
What they're going to do, they're going to sign and distribute any worthy indie project over the GameTap service.

682
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
This would be a really great way to get your game out there, because GameTap has their user base.

683
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
They won't say how big it is, which makes me think it's not that big.

684
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I don't know, I guess a lot of people are still not willing to fork over the $10 a month to pay the games.

685
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But this would be a really great way for GameTap to get more games that you can't get other places.

686
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I think it's a really good fit for GameTap and a smart thing for them to be doing right now.

687
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
If you want more information, GameTap.com.

688
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:00,000
They will also probably be announcing, I believe I read somewhere else, not this particular article I'm looking at now.

689
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I believe they announced somewhere else that a game developer conference are going to announce the first batch of games that are going to be on the indie label.

690
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So that's kind of cool.

691
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So, Loki, is this something that might get you on GameTap finally?

692
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Nope. I don't have time to be paying for online monthly subscriptions for games.

693
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I thought I'd ask anyway.

694
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I was just choking up a baby.

695
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Okay. Apparently this show has that effect on people.

696
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I'm sorry. I just coughed up a baby listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

697
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:44,000
They were talking about babies flying out of vaginas in one part and in the second part they coughed up a baby.

698
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It's amazing.

699
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Okay. There is some love coming out thanks to SNK.

700
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Art of Fighting actually is going to be having a collection to be released stateside.

701
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Art of Fighting was a very interesting game because it was a big definite knockoff in some respects of Street Fighter II,

702
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
what with, you know, Rio and, you know, Robert Garcia and all of them.

703
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Two of them also gave us Dan and later ones too.

704
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
But, I don't know. It's kind of cool.

705
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I always liked Art of Fighting because they did name a fighter after me.

706
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Having a rob in a fighting game was pretty cool.

707
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I also like that old school zoom in and out effect it did.

708
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Art of Fighting, though, gave us King.

709
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
That's right.

710
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And King was awesome.

711
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Big ol' lesbian.

712
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And Yuri with the flying butt attack.

713
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Got a lot of flying butt attacks.

714
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
In fact, I'm going to do a flying butt attack on Dark Sakura right now.

715
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Get your ass off me.

716
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I've been rubbed with gay ass.

717
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Anyways, if you like ridiculous weapons much like Rob's flying butt attack,

718
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
then you're definitely going to love Worms HD, which is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

719
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Speaking of ass worms.

720
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Finally, this Wednesday.

721
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So, that is awesome.

722
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's supposed to be 800 Microsoft points or $10 in real money.

723
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
And it's awesome.

724
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It's Worms.

725
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It's 2D.

726
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And, yeah, I can't wait to play it.

727
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
It's about fucking time this game came out to Xbox Live Arcade.

728
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Exploding Sheep, no Holy Hand Grenade.

729
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
That's the only disappointment for me, but that is still a fucking awesome game.

730
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Oh, Lord, bless this thy hand grenade.

731
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Well, what could also be very awesome for Xbox Live Arcade would be Sam and Max.

732
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And there are rumors abounding.

733
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
There's been for a little while that Sam and Max, of course, again, we mentioned GameTap earlier.

734
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It's kind of all coming together now.

735
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
The new Sam and Max adventures, I believe the most recent one was Episode 4, Abe Lincoln Must Die.

736
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The rumor is that these Sam and Max games might be ported over to Xbox Live Arcade.

737
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Now, Telltale Games finally said something this week about the whole thing.

738
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
They said they will, quote,

739
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
look closely at releasing a potential Sam and Max project.

740
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Quote,

741
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:14,000
We can confirm that we are hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, although we do not have any official Xbox project announcements to share right now.

742
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Well, I would think if they're hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, they've got something planned.

743
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And what else would be better than a Sam and Max game?

744
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I guess, granted, it doesn't have to be the same games that GameTap is getting,

745
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
but certainly bringing the Sam and Max series to Xbox Live Arcade, I'm sure Microsoft would be all over that.

746
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Well, something that our listeners are all over week in and week out is DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

747
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
DarkSakura surfs the internet up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

748
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I don't know what that meant.

749
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Every week.

750
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And she finds a website suitable to share with all of you.

751
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:57,000
We call it DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

752
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
My Website of the Week is a marvelously special one.

753
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It is Marvel.com, which I've been spending a whole shitload of time on,

754
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
downloading, I'm actually mostly just downloading wallpaper.

755
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,000
But they have, I think it's cool, they actually have some of the, I'd say comics from like a few months ago,

756
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
uploaded so that you can read them.

757
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
They have links to the toys, the movie news.

758
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
There's blogs up there, podcasts, stuff for mobile.

759
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It's actually pretty cool.

760
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I've been pretty happy with it.

761
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So I'd say check it out.

762
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It's really fun for a commercial site.

763
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
All right.

764
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
What are you surprised?

765
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
No, I'm just, I'm reading chat.

766
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I'm arguing with Black Wolf right now in chat.

767
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Hey Rob, do your job.

768
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Loki's friend is fighting me in chat right now.

769
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Loki's one friend saying that it's going to be hard to fit Sam and Max on Xbox Live Arcade

770
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
because of the size limit.

771
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And I said, well, they upped the size limit to 250 megabytes, remember?

772
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And Black Wolf says, yes, they'd have to make it more though.

773
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And Black Wolf says, I just don't want 360 people to get my Sam and Max heart game tab.

774
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
So that's sort of true.

775
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You don't want people to have your Loki, and you don't want people to have your Sam and Max.

776
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You are a very possessive individual, Mr. Bobby Black Wolf.

777
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I'm nobody's person, so, eh.

778
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
By the way, Bobby does his own show, Sunday Nights on All Games Radio.

779
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
A lot of our live listeners kind of see it as a pre-show to Orange Lounge Radio in some ways.

780
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
No, just teasing.

781
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Our shows complement each other very well.

782
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Bobby also is a big fan of the music games.

783
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You can check his show out at allgames.com.

784
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And listen to him stalk Loki on his program.

785
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Anyways, so apparently they've spotted a couple games on the Vice, or, I see VC and I think Vice City.

786
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Virtual Console Servers, because I know you can still do that little hack with the web browsers to view what's on those.

787
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But anyways, two games that have been spotted.

788
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
One of them being Elevator Action, which is pretty awesome, and then Tech Mobile.

789
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
No it's not.

790
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Elevator Action sucks.

791
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
It's one of those games people remember.

792
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
No, I'm talking about Tech Mobile.

793
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Oh, Tech Mobile's awesome.

794
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Yeah, fuck Elevator Action.

795
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Tech Mobile on the NES was awesome, but Tech Mobile on the arcade was not so awesome.

796
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Because I have the Tech Mobile arcade game on some Tech Mobile collection I had on the Xbox randomly.

797
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
But Tech Mobile on the NES was pretty rad.

798
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So I'm looking forward to seeing that.

799
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
That would be pretty cool.

800
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Elevator Action, not so much.

801
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Elevator Action was not that good.

802
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It's just people remember it because, ooh, it's a game with elevators.

803
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
You don't see that a lot.

804
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I really wish they would have new Rob.

805
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Even though Keystone Capers was a long time before it.

806
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,000
They need a Rob the Robot that plugs into one of your Wii U remotes.

807
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And then they need to release those games on there.

808
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Because I think that would be funny.

809
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Like a little miniature Rob the Robot.

810
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
They don't need it.

811
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Yes they do.

812
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Because I want Rob the Robot.

813
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Why?

814
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Rob the Robot.

815
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
For those two shit games they had for it.

816
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I mean to re-release Rob the Robot.

817
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
They can make new games.

818
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Do Rob 2.

819
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
How about Rob Roberts, the bot?

820
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
That'd be good.

821
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
No.

822
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
They need to bring back.

823
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
How about a Jamie bot where it just nags you to do things?

824
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That would be a woman bot, okay?

825
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Turn on your system.

826
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Download this upgrade.

827
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
No.

828
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I only called you once to ask you to turn on your aims.

829
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I'm going to send you the fucking pre-show.

830
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Do not be a bitch to Rob.

831
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Turn on your AOL.

832
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,000
If you think that I'm going to download your updates for you, you're completely wrong.

833
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I'm an independent woman.

834
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I'll do what I want.

835
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I'm shutting off in the middle of your game now.

836
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Wow.

837
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I love this show.

838
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I really, really love this show.

839
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
My battle aura.

840
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
All your memes have been deleted.

841
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I have a power level of over 4,000 now, Rob.

842
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I love you, Jamie.

843
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
The hell you do.

844
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And Jamie bot.

845
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
The hell you do.

846
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
You treat me like this.

847
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Look.

848
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Here.

849
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Look.

850
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Jamie, I got a story that'll make you happy because I know you love Zork and Leisure Suit

851
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Larry.

852
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Who doesn't love Leisure Suit?

853
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
No.

854
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And King's Quest?

855
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Actually, I never really played any of them except for the first Zork.

856
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Can't you just play along?

857
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Vodka.

858
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't think Vodka was a game.

859
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Okay.

860
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
How about the Indiana Jones games?

861
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Vodka Cures PMS.

862
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Maniac Mansion?

863
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah.

864
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I love Maniac Mansion.

865
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
There we go.

866
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Well, Maniac Mansion, I'm sure there'll be a mention of it at Adventure Con.

867
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
But news alert.

868
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Adventure Con is an adventure game convention that's going to happen August 28th and 29th

869
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
at the Mirage Hotel right on the Vegas Strip.

870
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
It's going to be two days of adventure game nerdom.

871
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
There's actually going to be a Zork room because, basically, Adventure Con had started

872
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
out as a 30th birthday celebration for Zork.

873
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And so they decided to – it kind of grew into this all-encompassing adventure game

874
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
thing.

875
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I don't know how many times Andreo started about music games, but now we're all video

876
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
games because we did that.

877
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So there you go.

878
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
That's kind of neat.

879
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And this, by the way, this is the first Adventure Con.

880
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So it started off being a Zork thing.

881
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Now it's this whole big thing because they're actually going to have Al Lowe from Sierra

882
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
there, Jane Jensen, the creator of the Gabriel Knights games.

883
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It's pretty rad.

884
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I did not realize that Zork 1 was written in 1977.

885
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
The White House with the mailbox here seems so, so long ago.

886
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Hey, Rob?

887
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
What?

888
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I just unleashed a grue in your underwear.

889
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Thank you.

890
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It's squishy.

891
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Anyway, moving on for some different news.

892
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
The games for Windows Live beta sign-up is now open.

893
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It's the Microsoft PC version of Xbox Live, and the two are going to be tied together

894
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
for cross-platform play.

895
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So go check it out if you are not blessed enough to console game with the rest of us

896
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
cool kids.

897
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,000
And I will not be checking this out because I do not have Vista.

898
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I do not want Vista.

899
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Nor do I want to play PC.

900
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Do not want.

901
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
But, what's kind of cool though, everyone remembers Wii-Cade.

902
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Wait, I have to say this real fast.

903
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You know why I don't want Windows Vista?

904
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Because I do not want my computer to look like those god-awful Heroes previews that

905
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
were brought to us by Windows Vista.

906
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Oh, I pissed off.

907
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
That turned me off to Windows Vista.

908
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I was like, what have you done to my Heroes?

909
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Do not want.

910
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And it's simulated Vista.

911
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Your offering has not pleased Kitty.

912
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
More.

913
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
No more.

914
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Do not want.

915
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So, Wii-Cade, Flashlight that has games made for the Wii browser.

916
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Well, they have just opened up a downloadable API that will allow developers of other Flash

917
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
games to use the Wii Remote's buttons for actual gameplay.

918
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Before, it used to be limited to kind of mouse games that use only the A button for clicking

919
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
and stuff like that.

920
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
But now they've actually figured out how to use every single button on the Wii Remote,

921
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
which is pretty fucking awesome.

922
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So, hopefully we'll see some pretty cool games come from this.

923
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
And hopefully I will actually work on OLRWii.com at some point.

924
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Yeah, you had to do that because there was some website I saw that had all these popular

925
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Wii game things listed or something.

926
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And I did not see OLRWii.com and I remembered, oh yeah, there's nothing on it.

927
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Sorry.

928
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Crackdown.

929
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's been a problem.

930
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
By the way, going back to the last story, it was commented in our chat room,

931
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Loki does not have friends on Vista.

932
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Where's Black Wolf now, Loki?

933
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Black Wolf even made that comment, so you got no friends now.

934
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I don't have Vista.

935
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Oh no.

936
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It's a joke.

937
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Well, here's the thing though.

938
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Windows Live, you remember, is part of the Live Anywhere, so technically I have a lot

939
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:23,000
more games for Windows Live than I do for actual the PS3 network.

940
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:31,000
So, ha, I do have friends on there and I don't even have it.

941
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Something that you can't play with friends, although I think it would be fun if you could.

942
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It's a SimCity DS.

943
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Actually, I don't know much about this.

944
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Perhaps maybe you can play with friends.

945
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Oh, there is wireless data exchange in this game.

946
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
You can't play with friends.

947
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
SimCity DS.

948
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It has officially been announced that it will be coming to the US.

949
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Yay.

950
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Other things that SimCity DS allows you to do.

951
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
You can blow out fires by blowing on the DS's microphone.

952
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Doesn't that actually keep fires going?

953
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Ah, forget it.

954
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You sign off proclamations using the stylus.

955
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
That's fun.

956
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So, there you have it.

957
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
That will be coming out in June, by the way.

958
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
That's a nice little translation time between Japan and the US there.

959
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Because I believe this game just came out in Japan like last week.

960
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I have to admit I'm not as excited about this game because it's based off the SimCity 2000 engine.

961
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And I didn't like SimCity when it went 3D.

962
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It was too much for my feeble brain to handle.

963
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Bring me my old school 2D SimCity.

964
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I actually have it on Virtual Console and I never play it because I get sucked into other games.

965
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Like World of Warcraft.

966
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Well, you know, that's just because you're an addict, Rob.

967
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
How about a different game?

968
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
How about Darwinia?

969
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Darwinia, as announced by Introversion, is going to be multiplayer in 2008.

970
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Excuse me.

971
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It's set for release on its own.

972
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It's called Multi-Winia. We'll let you play cooperatively or competitively.

973
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,000
The number of people on, they're not really sure how much they're going to be able to handle.

974
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:24,000
But they're hoping that they're going to go really, really massive.

975
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I'm going to reserve judgment for actually seeing it.

976
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:42,000
They're saying that there's a quote by John Nottenbelt saying that it will let you organize your Darwinians into ranks and create massive armies.

977
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
So that would be kind of cool.

978
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I don't know. I'm still going to reserve judgment for actually seeing it.

979
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Is that a free game? I can't remember. Was Darwinia a free one?

980
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I believe it was. I thought about playing it.

981
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:01,000
The chat, I'm sure, knows because I believe some folks ought to know what's going on there.

982
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Let me see if anybody in chat can answer my question there.

983
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Oh, they say no it wasn't.

984
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I think you could download a demo for free is what it was.

985
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Hitstun says Darwinia had a demo but the game was $20.

986
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I was going to see if it was something I wanted to check out.

987
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I'll check out the demo because I'm kind of curious.

988
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:27,000
By the way, I'm very proud of Miklotov because he's been unlocking achievements in Crackdown for me while this show's been going on.

989
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So he got me this First Blood achievement, which I didn't have, and Bare Knuckle Brawler.

990
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Kill 150 gang members with your bare hands. Nice.

991
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So if you wondered how I was on Xbox Live during the show, it's actually Miklotov playing Crackdown right now.

992
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Awesome.

993
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
But I have more achievements than you do at Crackdown.

994
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Alrighty. Yeah, you have a shitload of achievements in Crackdown.

995
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I have more achievements than you do in Universe.

996
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Oh God, I can't believe I didn't mention this at the top of the show.

997
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
That's alright. Nobody gets to the end of the show.

998
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Do you know who I got a message from on Xbox Live while I was playing DDR Universe?

999
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
No.

1000
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Strip Club DJ. Do you know who that person is?

1001
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Yes.

1002
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:10,000
He is like the guy who was, for a long time, he was the number one gamer points holder on all of Xbox Live, right?

1003
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
He has over 100,000 gamer score.

1004
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I got a message from him, and it said simply,

1005
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Can you use the joystick on DDR?

1006
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Because I think he's probably contemplating, do I want to get DDR to get the 1,000 achievement points out of?

1007
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
So I replied. I replied with a voice message though.

1008
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
But I said something like, yes you can, but obviously you're supposed to use the dance pad,

1009
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
but if you're just trying to run through the game, you'll probably just want to use the controller.

1010
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
But I said something about quest mode sucking, and a lot of the unlocks coming through that.

1011
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Yeah, see I was stupid and I told somebody there was like 75 unlocks because in quest mode it says 0 of 75 for music stuff.

1012
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
That's how much you own, or how many songs you own in quest mode, right?

1013
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
That's what it is.

1014
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,000
When you buy a song in quest mode to have the advantage in quest mode, that's...

1015
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
See, the game doesn't fucking explain any of this.

1016
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
That's why quest mode sucks.

1017
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I didn't even know what the hell that meant.

1018
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
That's what it means.

1019
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
So there you go.

1020
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
But that was kind of funny to get a message from him because I guess apparently at one point,

1021
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
and I looked at my gamercard.net right after that because that's the one that ranks,

1022
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I was apparently like number six or seven in the world for gamer score earned in DDR universe.

1023
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Really?

1024
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Yeah, because I ran through the game and played all the songs.

1025
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I got like 400 achievement points and then I just ran through a lot of the game real fast.

1026
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm sure I'm not up there anymore when you look.

1027
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I gotta just play through it. I can probably get way up there.

1028
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I think it's getting harder and harder now.

1029
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I doubt I'm even in the top 25 at this point.

1030
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Now you got me all curious. I'm gonna look.

1031
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
See, am I even up there now?

1032
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Oh wow, I'm still number 17.

1033
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Look at that. There I am.

1034
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Does anyone have all of them?

1035
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Somebody has 900 points, 900 of the points, and somebody else has 860.

1036
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But nobody has all 1,000 yet.

1037
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I only have 480 points in the game.

1038
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It's not that hard to...

1039
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I mean, I could probably, if I really just sat down and played it,

1040
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I could probably crank out the whole game in one day.

1041
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I may think achievement points are fun and all,

1042
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
and they kind of add something to the game,

1043
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
but I would not consider myself an achievement point whore, so to speak.

1044
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So it was kind of just interesting that I did show up on there

1045
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
and got contacted by Strip Club DJ.

1046
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
A true achievement points whore because of it, so interesting.

1047
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Anyhow, we're gonna open up the Skype line.

1048
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
If you want to give us a call and interact with our program, you can do so.

1049
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
The number is 1-877-GAME-OLR,

1050
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
or you can always use Skype to give us a call.

1051
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

1052
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
If you want more information on that, you can visit www.orangeloungeradio.com

1053
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
and click on Interact With Us,

1054
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
and we'll wait for some calls to start coming in.

1055
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
While we wait for something to come in, does anybody have a last-minute story?

1056
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Yep.

1057
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
What do you want, Jamie?

1058
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Well, Lucky had one first, right?

1059
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Just real quick.

1060
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Just one story for now, and then we'll get to some other calls.

1061
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Just real quick.

1062
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
In God of War 2, someone had gotten the game out before it's come out,

1063
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
and on the back of the manual, it says God of War PSP coming in 2007.

1064
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So confirm it is coming on the PSP.

1065
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
All right, there you have it.

1066
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Now we can go to the phones.

1067
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Well, wait.

1068
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
We'll get more last-minute stories in a minute.

1069
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
No problem.

1070
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Hi, you're on Renaissance Radio.

1071
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Who's this?

1072
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Legend of Zaku.

1073
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Hi, Legend of Zaku.

1074
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

1075
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I already know about, you know, that Gold test is going to be released tomorrow for the location test, right?

1076
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I think you said, because you're dropping out there on the stream a little bit,

1077
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
you said something about 2DX Gold coming out tomorrow for a location test.

1078
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Yeah, we mentioned that on last week's show.

1079
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Why?

1080
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,000
No, I mean, they're all saying that, you know, from what I'm hearing right now is that,

1081
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
you know, it has to do really good in order for it to actually move any further.

1082
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
It's like a one-shot deal at the moment right now.

1083
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Well, but wait a minute, though.

1084
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I mean, what about those arcades that import Japanese games anyway,

1085
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
like Arcade Infinity and whatever that one is on the East Coast that was...

1086
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:09,000
But it changes on that single location test happening tomorrow and for the next two weeks.

1087
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So this is the one that might tip the scale.

1088
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Well, what city is it in again?

1089
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It's somewhere in Illinois, right?

1090
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Naperville.

1091
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Naperville?

1092
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Yeah.

1093
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
In Illinois?

1094
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Yeah, it's near Betzen's locations nearby in Chicago.

1095
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
All right.

1096
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Well, if you are in the Chicago Naperville area and you are a music video game fan

1097
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
and you want to see BeatMania make a U.S. debut in arcades, you've got to go.

1098
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You've got to help out.

1099
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
If you want to see it out, go through.

1100
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Come through on it.

1101
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
All right.

1102
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Well, thank you for the reminder, Mr. Zaku.

1103
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I unfortunately cannot attend.

1104
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Chicago's a little far.

1105
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It's several thousand miles.

1106
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I know there's listeners probably in Illinois hearing this right now.

1107
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
That's very true.

1108
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
We do have the luxury of being not too far from L.A.

1109
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
where we can drive for six hours to play 2DX Gold whenever they get it.

1110
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
If they don't already have it, I don't even know.

1111
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I haven't actually followed BeatMania in a while, sadly.

1112
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Right.

1113
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
All right.

1114
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Well, anything else, Zaku?

1115
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Just Sony's rumbling about why they didn't bother to settle quickly with immersion

1116
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
rather than just wait until they drop the PS3.

1117
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Pride.

1118
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Pride is more like they were banking on a sinking ship called their lawsuit.

1119
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Well, remember that Rumble is so last gen.

1120
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Well, they're spinning and they're in denial.

1121
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
It's like a little kid.

1122
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,000
They know they fucked up, and so they're just like they don't want to admit it.

1123
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
They don't want to admit they fucked up badly.

1124
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And that's why PS3 is not even worth getting right now, not even for another year.

1125
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
All right.

1126
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Well, Zaku, thank you very much for the call, and good luck with your 2DX Gold promotion.

1127
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
All right.

1128
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Thank you.

1129
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
All right.

1130
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Let's go to another phone call.

1131
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Hi.

1132
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1133
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Who's this?

1134
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Hey.

1135
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
What's up, guys?

1136
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It's the Rob D.

1137
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Hi, Rob D. Are you still bitter about your loss from last week?

1138
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Not so much.

1139
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
All right.

1140
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I'm just giving you a hard time.

1141
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Lucky did a good job on that.

1142
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Very good sport about the whole thing.

1143
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

1144
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Not too much.

1145
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Just wondering what you guys thought about the news about the 20-gigabyte PS3 being possibly

1146
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
discontinued.

1147
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I don't know if you heard about that.

1148
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Kind of.

1149
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
We actually did cover it in part A. I don't know if Bobby's show ran long tonight or what.

1150
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
No, I suck then.

1151
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
It's okay.

1152
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I've actually been busy recording some stuff, but that's a different story altogether.

1153
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
That's all right.

1154
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
We'll forgive you.

1155
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:39,000
You know, the 20-gig model, I mean, it was not something I was interested in anyway,

1156
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
so I'm a little bit, you know, kind of about the whole thing anyway.

1157
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
I think, to be honest, the 20-gig model is just as good as the 60-gig as far as what's

1158
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
available for it.

1159
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I mean, if I were to buy one, I would pick the 20-gig.

1160
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I have a 20-gig, and it's great.

1161
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I mean, it's not like I have to worry about filling up with downloads because there's

1162
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
nothing to download on it.

1163
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Well, isn't the 60-gigabyte version supposed to have dual HDMI ports?

1164
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Oh, wait.

1165
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
No, it doesn't.

1166
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
And then all models do have HDMI access.

1167
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
No, I'm kidding.

1168
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
That's what they said to E3.

1169
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But, yeah.

1170
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Other than that, that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about.

1171
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
All right.

1172
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Well, thank you very much for the call, Rob D. We appreciate it.

1173
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Thank you for taking my call.

1174
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
See you guys later.

1175
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
No problem.

1176
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Have a good week.

1177
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Bye.

1178
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
All right.

1179
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Bye.

1180
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
All right.

1181
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
If you want to give a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you got to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1182
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Dark Soccer, why don't you throw us your last-minute story while we're waiting for a call.

1183
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Well, it was actually something posted by Tigerclaw in the chat room during the break

1184
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,000
was Activision released a screenshot from the new Transformers game that they're putting

1185
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
out.

1186
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Yeah, it makes my heart break.

1187
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I'm not going to like the movie.

1188
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I don't think.

1189
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It doesn't look like Transformers.

1190
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,000
And the game makes my heart hurt.

1191
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
What's so bad about it?

1192
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
What isn't so bad about it?

1193
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh, my God.

1194
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Did you see it?

1195
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
No.

1196
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
What does it look like?

1197
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It's fucking awesome is what it is.

1198
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
The fuck it is?

1199
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
That does not look like Bumblebee.

1200
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
It looks like a bee's head and like junk.

1201
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I can't wait to see this movie.

1202
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
It's going to be awesome.

1203
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Look.

1204
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
I know.

1205
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
It's awesome.

1206
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I mean, I'll go see it because I have to, but God, it's fucking ugly.

1207
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
All right.

1208
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Well, let's go to another call here on the Skype line and see what you folks have to

1209
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
say.

1210
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Hi.

1211
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

1212
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Who's this?

1213
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Whoa.

1214
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Can you guys hear me?

1215
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Hi.

1216
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Yes.

1217
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
We can hear you.

1218
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
What's up?

1219
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Hey.

1220
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
This is DDR Dollar Bill.

1221
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.

1222
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
What's on your mind?

1223
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Nothing much.

1224
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I got a Wii for Valentine's Day.

1225
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Oh, wheelie.

1226
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Yes, wheelie.

1227
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It's a nice little present, too, I figured.

1228
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
What did you think?

1229
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Me and a girlfriend love it a lot.

1230
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:10,000
We play mostly Wii Sports and Wii Play, and we also ended up getting into Metal Slug Anthology.

1231
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:20,000
My big thing was that, did somebody in the show say that Metal Slug Anthology stunk?

1232
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
No.

1233
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It's awesome.

1234
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I haven't played Metal Gear Anthology.

1235
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I'm sorry.

1236
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Metal Slug Anthology.

1237
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,880
I think what we said on the show is that Kropotkin and Hendrix reviewed it this week.

1238
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:36,520
We were teasing the All Games thing because they play Kropotkin and Hendrix between our

1239
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,080
show.

1240
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,760
I don't know if they said it sucked.

1241
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,280
I unfortunately did not get a chance to hear their show yet this week.

1242
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:43,560
I don't think they did, though.

1243
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,560
I think they liked it.

1244
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,560
Yeah.

1245
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:50,280
It's pretty much better than the other emulations that came out for the other systems because

1246
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:54,480
in most other emulated versions, like the Xbox, for example, there were loading times

1247
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,360
in between each level.

1248
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,680
This one has none.

1249
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:03,080
It just pretty much goes into the game and plays it straight through, so it's exactly

1250
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,560
like the arcade.

1251
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,560
Interesting.

1252
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:09,880
What else on the Wii have you been playing?

1253
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,800
So obviously Metal Slug Anthology.

1254
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:18,920
I tried the Wii Sports and the Wii Play, and the Wii Play, it's alright.

1255
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,560
It was just worth it for the other controller, you know?

1256
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,560
Gotcha.

1257
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,440
Yeah, but the Wii Sports is a blast.

1258
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,960
What do you think the Wii's chances are against the 360 and the PlayStation 3?

1259
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:31,960
You live...

1260
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,160
Where was it that you live again?

1261
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,760
New York, nearby where Rama lives.

1262
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,000
What do you think, I thought for some reason you were in another country, what do you think

1263
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,840
the chances are of the Wii doing against the 360 and the PS3 in the long run?

1264
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:52,280
If they can get better games that just don't rely on the Wii controls, but rather makes

1265
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:57,840
something like the original stuff and a good third party support, yeah, it's definitely

1266
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:03,640
going to be allowed for a while, and not just thought of as a party system, you know?

1267
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,660
Anything else you want to share with our listeners, my friend?

1268
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:06,660
One question.

1269
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:07,660
Yes.

1270
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:13,680
What was the exact difference with Zelda on the GameCube and the Wii?

1271
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:18,760
Everything is right-handed on the Wii and left-handed on the GameCube.

1272
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,360
So they have the same graphics and music and all that?

1273
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,360
Actually, no.

1274
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,640
The GameCube does not support the 16 by 9.

1275
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,640
Gotcha.

1276
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,080
Everything will be in the square as well, and that's why the graphics suffer a little

1277
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,080
bit.

1278
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,080
Oh, okay.

1279
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,080
So, there you go.

1280
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,080
All right.

1281
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,240
All right, well thank you so much for the call, buddy, and enjoy the Wii.

1282
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,960
Thanks, see you guys.

1283
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:40,960
Later.

1284
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,960
All right, we'll try at least one more call here on the Skype line.

1285
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,040
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1286
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,680
It's deep breathing.

1287
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:49,680
Sorry.

1288
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,680
It's me.

1289
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:51,680
It's you.

1290
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,680
I thought it was an erotic phone call.

1291
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,680
Who's this?

1292
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,680
This is Youni.

1293
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,680
Hi, Youni.

1294
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,840
What's on your mind, buddy?

1295
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,560
I was wondering about something.

1296
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:04,040
I was thinking about getting a PS3, but you know how crappy they are?

1297
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,400
Yeah, yeah.

1298
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,080
What might be swaying your mind on this?

1299
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:15,740
Well, I do play a lot of PS2 games on my PS2 and everything.

1300
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:21,880
I don't know why I would want to buy one other than it enhances the graphics on your PS2

1301
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,880
games.

1302
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:29,040
And even for a while, it was de-hancing them, if you might have seen anything a while back.

1303
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,320
It's like, why should you buy one?

1304
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:38,680
Because they're like a 300 or 400, maybe 500 piece of crap, really.

1305
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:44,680
I'm just thinking about what I should buy, because I'm not really sure yet.

1306
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:48,760
I don't think the PlayStation 3 is worth it at the time.

1307
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,800
Again, you've got to remember the golden rule of gaming here at Orange Launch Radio.

1308
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:57,600
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1309
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,560
So it's really about what type of games you want to play.

1310
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:06,840
I mean, if first person shooters are your thing, oh my God, Xbox 360 all the way.

1311
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:11,920
If you want something that's a little more lighthearted, fun type of games, the Wii is

1312
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,040
very your active system type of game.

1313
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,080
And then, of course, you've got the PlayStation 3, which doesn't have a lot right now.

1314
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,960
It's thought that a little later on down the line, it's strengths will be role playing

1315
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,000
games and so on, just like it was on PlayStation 2.

1316
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,360
But right now, not a lot going for it.

1317
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,920
And you've got Microsoft trying to step it up with what they were lacking with the Xbox

1318
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,840
the first time around.

1319
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:36,280
They're talking about bringing out another MMO from Square Enix called Final Fantasy

1320
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,280
13.

1321
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,160
I'm not really sure about it.

1322
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:44,200
I mean, it might bring me back to Square Enix, but they're really sitting on their thumbs

1323
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:48,460
most of the time when you're calling a GM on Final Fantasy 11.

1324
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:55,080
I've been playing WoW, and when you call a GM, it's like that.

1325
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,640
You get the call, they answer it, they really care about their customers.

1326
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,840
Well, thank God Final Fantasy 13 is not online then.

1327
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,680
Yeah, I agree.

1328
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,280
I think WoW, to WoW's credit, they probably have a bigger budget because they have like

1329
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,960
umpteen million subscribers.

1330
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,560
They probably have people on the clock 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

1331
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,560
That's true.

1332
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,920
But Final Fantasy 13 versus is not going to be online.

1333
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:20,160
I think it's going to be more of a Kingdom Hearts-ish game, but that sounds pretty hot

1334
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:21,160
to me.

1335
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,160
Yeah.

1336
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:26,440
Final Fantasy 13 probably will be the game that gets me on PlayStation.

1337
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:33,400
I also heard that Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories is coming to the PS2.

1338
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,600
I saw the trailer for it.

1339
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,240
There's a big trailer report on YouTube.

1340
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,840
It's completely redone, full style for the Kingdom Hearts games.

1341
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:46,160
It's really, really awesome looking.

1342
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:49,860
If I can remember where to find it, I should see if I can't repost the YouTube link.

1343
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:52,120
I'm very curious to check this out myself.

1344
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,680
It is freaking awesome.

1345
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:55,360
You should check it out.

1346
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,360
It better be.

1347
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,360
All right.

1348
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,800
Because if I'm rebuying Kingdom Hearts 2 for it, it better be.

1349
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,800
All right.

1350
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,760
Well, UNI, thanks so much for the call, and take care, and good luck on your system hunting.

1351
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:05,760
You too.

1352
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,760
Thank you.

1353
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,760
Thank you.

1354
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,760
All right.

1355
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,760
Let's see if we get any more calls.

1356
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,760
Ring, ring, ring.

1357
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,760
Oh.

1358
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,760
Well, that must be on the back line.

1359
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,760
Hi.

1360
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:14,760
Who's this?

1361
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,760
This is Shane.

1362
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,760
Oh, hi.

1363
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:17,760
Oh, hey.

1364
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:18,760
Shane's standing right in front of me.

1365
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:19,760
Hi, Shane.

1366
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,760
Hi.

1367
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,760
AKA Miklatov.

1368
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,760
That's what I am this week.

1369
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,760
We can't call you Miklatov anymore.

1370
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,840
Well, I had to change it because I'm trying to get into a pump group, and there was already

1371
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,920
a Miklatov in pump, so I have to go by my more recent nickname of Arx.

1372
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,200
Well, whatever the hell your name is.

1373
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,200
That's why I just go by Shane.

1374
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,200
All right.

1375
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,200
Then what do you want?

1376
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,200
Crackdown's the best game ever.

1377
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,200
I love it.

1378
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,200
It's in my mind.

1379
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,200
Yeah.

1380
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,200
I saw you unlock some achievements for me.

1381
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,200
I appreciate that.

1382
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,200
Heck, yeah.

1383
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,200
It's so much fun kicking them.

1384
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,200
What?

1385
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,200
I wasn't really getting into it.

1386
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,200
What really do you love about this game?

1387
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:50,840
You can jump really high, and you jump across rooftops, and you're like the Tick, that superhero.

1388
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,400
Was it just because I hadn't leveled up enough that I couldn't do it?

1389
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,400
No.

1390
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,080
I think you just didn't understand what you were doing, and...

1391
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,080
You're right.

1392
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,080
I didn't.

1393
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:03,200
You're supposed to go and shoot people and kick them and jump from roof to roof, and

1394
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,560
it's so much fun, and I really want it.

1395
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:06,560
All right.

1396
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,440
Well, you can't have my copy because now that you've told me it's fun, I need to go back

1397
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,440
and play it more.

1398
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,440
It's a terrible game.

1399
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,440
Lies.

1400
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:13,440
Yeah.

1401
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,440
Lies.

1402
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,440
You played Myst Online a little bit.

1403
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,440
What'd you think of that?

1404
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:22,400
I think I would like it a whole lot if it didn't have the worst controls I've ever touched.

1405
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,400
It's really terrible.

1406
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,040
But it's simple.

1407
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,400
Simply hard.

1408
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:37,120
Maybe if it had a game pad input thing I could use, but I can't use W-A-S-D, and it goes

1409
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:41,640
back to that old Resident Evil style where up is always forward no matter which way you're

1410
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:46,720
facing, and I don't dig that, and the mouse is awkward to use.

1411
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:50,240
But I think I will probably give it another shot because it was really cool because I

1412
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,840
like solving puzzle things.

1413
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,320
All right.

1414
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,680
And Crackdown is a great game.

1415
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,680
It's so much fun.

1416
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,840
I would say something more, but it's probably racist.

1417
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,160
It is so funny.

1418
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,560
Can I say it anyway?

1419
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,560
I guess.

1420
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:12,880
It's so much fun kicking the Mexicans in the head.

1421
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,360
Orange Lounge Radio has just been banned from Mexico.

1422
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,360
Look at that.

1423
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:17,360
How do you like that?

1424
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,520
That's the only part I'm at right now.

1425
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:22,840
I'm sure once I beat that part I can go kick some other race, but Mexicans are so easy

1426
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,840
to target.

1427
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,840
All right.

1428
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,840
There you go.

1429
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,840
Click.

1430
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,560
DDR dollar bill says holy racist remark.

1431
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,560
My God.

1432
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,560
Act Deafed.

1433
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,560
Act Deafed is a Mexican.

1434
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,560
Didn't like that comment.

1435
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:35,520
Did not like that comment.

1436
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:41,840
That's okay because I'm like a quarter Brazilian and that's all I know, so I'm dirty too.

1437
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:49,880
You can send those cards and letters to Shane or Miklata or whatever the fuck your name

1438
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,800
is this week at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1439
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:00,320
Act Deafed says I'm a Mexican, but I agree with Miklata, so there you go.

1440
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,320
The violence.

1441
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,320
The violence.

1442
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,960
I do not appreciate the violence.

1443
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,160
Our phone lines are ringing off the hook and everyone's trying to get in.

1444
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,160
All right.

1445
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,160
One more call.

1446
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:11,160
Hi.

1447
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,160
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1448
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,160
Who's this?

1449
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,160
Hi.

1450
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,160
This is Agent Otto.

1451
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,160
Agent Otto.

1452
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,040
I don't recognize your name.

1453
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,040
What do you want, Agent Otto?

1454
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,240
Are you a new listener?

1455
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,200
Are you a new listener of Orange Lounge Radio?

1456
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,600
I'm from Elevator Action.

1457
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,600
Oh.

1458
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,600
Oh, God.

1459
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,600
Oh, yes.

1460
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:30,200
Elevator Action, that horribly overrated game from the 1980s.

1461
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,600
How are you, Agent Otto?

1462
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,600
I'm doing great.

1463
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,000
I don't know what your problem is with my game and what I do for a living.

1464
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,600
I go into buildings, find documents, and not get shot in the head and not get crushed by

1465
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:41,600
elevators.

1466
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,600
Well, what do you do?

1467
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,360
You sit there and talk about how bad my game is?

1468
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,860
Well, Agent Otto, your game bored the shit out of me because it was pretty much the same

1469
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:51,880
joke after the first two minutes for hours on end.

1470
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,720
You know the game's actually hard, right?

1471
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:56,720
Yes, it is pretty hard.

1472
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,760
That's another reason why I don't play it.

1473
01:16:58,760 --> 01:16:59,760
Oh.

1474
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,440
Well, then you probably didn't play anything from the 80s then because you clearly hate

1475
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,440
hard games.

1476
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,800
No, I actually played a lot of games from the 80s, like Crystal Castles.

1477
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,500
Actually, I don't know if you listened to the program last week, but we had a whole

1478
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:13,600
segment on 80s games that I'd played and beat the host.

1479
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,840
I don't listen to your show.

1480
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,840
I'm too busy going to...

1481
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:20,560
How do you get the number to this program then, Agent Otto?

1482
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:25,080
Because I'm at DMN's house drinking beer, and I heard you talking shit about me.

1483
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,320
Why are you hanging out with DMN?

1484
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,000
He sucks.

1485
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,680
Because I have no one better to hang out with.

1486
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,680
I see.

1487
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:35,200
So, Agent Otto is DMN's only friend, just like Black Wolf is Loki's only friend.

1488
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,280
Yeah, I know.

1489
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,480
He's a pretty sad guy.

1490
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:44,640
Well, then, much like I do to DMN, Agent Otto, I'm hanging up on you now.

1491
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:52,360
Going to the chat room, let's see.

1492
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,240
Sky Warrior says DMN is not funny.

1493
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,520
Alpha Catagram says DMN sucks.

1494
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:04,760
You can hear DMN here on Orange Lounge Radio on Thursday nights on STFU, if you want to

1495
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:05,760
hear that.

1496
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,760
Uni says DMN is not funny.

1497
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,760
Aw, poor DMN.

1498
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,760
Poor baby.

1499
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:14,960
Alright, sorry to those folks we didn't get to, but we got to get the show wrapped up

1500
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,560
because it's already like 20 minutes after 9, we're running a little long tonight, and

1501
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,320
we'd like to go home at a decent hour tonight.

1502
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:25,120
So if there's any more last minute stories, now's a good time to get them out?

1503
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,120
Nope.

1504
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,120
Loki?

1505
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,120
Nope.

1506
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,680
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1507
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,240
Loki, your final thought?

1508
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,760
I need to finish Crackdown.

1509
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,280
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

1510
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,600
I need to play more Captain America.

1511
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:45,680
My final thought is Pants!

1512
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,560
Thank you so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent gaming

1513
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:50,560
radio.

1514
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,880
If you want to show your appreciation for Orange Lounge Radio and us doing this crap

1515
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:58,880
for free, you can tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio, because if everybody tells two

1516
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,000
people about Orange Lounge Radio, within weeks we will have taken over the world.

1517
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,760
So thank you very much, and if you have no friends to tell about Orange Lounge Radio,

1518
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:14,080
you can always leave us a nice review on iTunes or Digg or Podcast Alley or one of those sites.

1519
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,600
That will work as well.

1520
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,480
All right, so that's going to do it for the show.

1521
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,040
We'll see you here next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1522
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,040
