00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:14,737
[SPEAKER_12]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,457 --> 00:00:19,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:27,465
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are back on Orange Lounge Radio here with part B of our podcast, or audio blog, audio cast, whatever you want to call it.

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,231
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the audio archive of our program, and it's split up into two parts.

6
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:36,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Part A is released usually early, early Monday morning, late Sunday night, however you want to look at it.

7
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:40,452
[SPEAKER_11]: Part B comes out sometime on Wednesday, whenever we get around to uploading it.

8
00:00:40,892 --> 00:00:44,913
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is the second half of a continuing show that is taped live on Sunday nights.

9
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:47,713
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you feel like coming down for a show, you should join us.

10
00:00:48,453 --> 00:00:51,174
[SPEAKER_11]: www.orangeloungeradio.com We have a chat room.

11
00:00:51,354 --> 00:00:51,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, chat room.

12
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:57,075
[SPEAKER_11]: And you missed our great bonus segment and things you can only hear live or on our rebroadcast at allgames.com.

13
00:00:57,851 --> 00:00:59,412
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:18,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Starting off this segment with some pretty big news.

15
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,000
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to do with the Halo 3 beta.

16
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Rumor is that the Halo 3 beta is going to be split into two sessions.

17
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:27,446
[SPEAKER_11]: The first session will begin on March 21st.

18
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:30,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Seems pretty bold that these predictions are naming dates.

19
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:35,092
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is from Xbox Portugal, who also brought the first Halo 3 beta screenshots.

20
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:38,915
[SPEAKER_11]: The first session will only be for those that got emails from Bungie.

21
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:40,616
[SPEAKER_11]: That starts March 21st.

22
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:44,459
[SPEAKER_11]: The second session will be also open to those who bought Crackdown.

23
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,800
[SPEAKER_11]: That will end in June, but no start date given for that yet.

24
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,480
[SPEAKER_11]: But, Loki, you were telling me during the break you heard this is bullshit.

25
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I heard it's bullshit.

26
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:52,681
[SPEAKER_11]: How is it proven wrong?

27
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:57,802
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was either someone at Microsoft or someone at Bungie that said that it would just be one giant session.

28
00:01:58,102 --> 00:01:59,583
[SPEAKER_10]: That they weren't going to do two different ones.

29
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:01,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there you have it.

30
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:04,524
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Xbox Portugal lies.

31
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:05,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe not.

32
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:06,964
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just miscommunications.

33
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:12,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki said Halo 3 would be coming out in the spring, which was also a lie.

34
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:14,186
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there you have it.

35
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:16,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Lies!

36
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:19,383
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be ashamed.

37
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:19,823
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

38
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:34,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Something, though, that actually is pretty cool, as announced in OXM, the Halo theme is going to be a downloadable track for Guitar Hero 2.

39
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's pretty cool.

40
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:49,501
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely going to be something that I think is going to get a lot of people to look more into those downloaded tracks and something that's going to make a little bit of revenue.

41
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:50,041
[SPEAKER_08]: So why not?

42
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:50,582
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be cool.

43
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:53,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, here it's going to be free.

44
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:56,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

45
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:57,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I like free.

46
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:00,664
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, it would be a good promotion for the Halo 3 game.

47
00:03:01,184 --> 00:03:05,265
[SPEAKER_11]: What I also want to know, though, is can Master Chief be one of the guitarists that you can play as?

48
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:05,765
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be cool.

49
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:06,285
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be awesome.

50
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:08,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it was pretty awesome to have Master Chief in Dead or Alive 4.

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it wasn't Master Chief.

52
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:11,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Spartan.

53
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:12,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Female Spartan.

54
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:14,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

55
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:16,585
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, having a Halo character in the game was kind of funny.

56
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:18,546
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Mistress Chief.

57
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:19,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, my bad.

58
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:20,908
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be Chieftess.

59
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:31,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, so yes, one of my favorite topics of discussion is how people are hacking firmwares on consoles.

60
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:39,561
[SPEAKER_10]: And one very famous group, Team Executor, one of the ones I think pioneered some of the homebrew stuff on the PSP,

61
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:45,461
[SPEAKER_10]: have broken the firmware for the Xbox 360.

62
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:50,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, right now, there's apparently a...

63
00:03:51,877 --> 00:04:02,721
[SPEAKER_10]: and they can't disclose too much but there is a glitch in one of the older firmwares for the 360 that will allow you to use a copy of King Kong to run your own code.

64
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:11,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of similar to what they're doing with some of the older firmwares on the PSP where you could run homebrew with Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.

65
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:21,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently one of the shaders I guess that was in King Kong was actually unsigned and so they could buffer overflow it and cause it to run their own

66
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:32,867
[SPEAKER_10]: And they actually released a proof of concept, I think like Hello World or something like that, that you can run on your 360 if you happen to have this firmware.

67
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:36,611
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently there's a way to check it by going to your system menu and stuff like that.

68
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:49,762
[SPEAKER_10]: But like I said, if you're getting your automatic updates on live like most people are, you probably have already patched the hole in this because the problem has been patched in some of the future firmwares.

69
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:50,042
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

70
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:58,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, right now, there's no way to roll back the firmware, kind of like you can do on the PSP.

71
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:08,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, if you have the older firmware, there is apparently a thing you can break on the motherboard or something that you can do that will allow you to be able to roll it back no matter what firmware you have later on.

72
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:09,835
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

73
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:13,336
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, can't Microsoft just patch this right away?

74
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:14,137
[SPEAKER_10]: They can.

75
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:15,517
[SPEAKER_11]: They're pretty good.

76
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:20,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Of all the companies, they're the fastest at closing up these loopholes real quick.

77
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:21,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

78
00:05:22,282 --> 00:05:33,951
[SPEAKER_10]: At least on the 360, not so much Windows XP, but... And right now, really, I don't think there's a way, I mean, you can really detect this because it's, you know, it's being run in a game almost.

79
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:43,699
[SPEAKER_10]: It's loading with a game, so unless they just ban the use of King Kong altogether, it's going to be pretty hard for them to, you know, stop it altogether.

80
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:44,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, though.

81
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,084
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, they've already pretty much done, they've patched the whole for this, so...

82
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,031
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

83
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:27,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Vulnerability, and it's found in kernel versions 4532 and 4548.

84
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:39,285
[SPEAKER_10]: So apparently if you pull up your Xbox 360 under the system menu and look up system information, there's a little thing on the bottom of the screen.

85
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:42,606
[SPEAKER_10]: It says D, and then there's a bunch of numbers, and then K and a bunch of numbers.

86
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:50,028
[SPEAKER_10]: If your kernel says 2.0 point and then either the 40 or the, what was it,

87
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:53,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Christ is a lot of specifics.

88
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:25,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yes, because the rampant piracy will certainly make the games even better.

89
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:27,583
[SPEAKER_11]: That was sarcasm.

90
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:30,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Hasn't hurt the PS2 anymore.

91
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:32,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Or the PSP.

92
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:42,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there are some franchises that every so often will rear their ugly heads over the course of video gaming history.

93
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:43,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

94
00:07:45,254 --> 00:07:47,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Prince of Persia, not so stabity.

95
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:21,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, I was never a fan of the Prince of Persia games, so I'm like, wow.

96
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:23,043
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not bad.

97
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,044
[SPEAKER_11]: The new ones aren't bad.

98
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:29,567
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they're quite like, oh my god, as a lot of people have said they are, but I played some of the older ones on GameTap.

99
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:30,848
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not bad.

100
00:08:31,848 --> 00:08:35,411
[SPEAKER_11]: For a 3D action type game, they're pretty solid.

101
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:37,192
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a pretty good game, and...

102
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:39,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

103
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:40,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I can see why it does as well.

104
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:45,082
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the one coming off the Wii, the Port of Two Thrones, I guess, but it rivals swords, I guess.

105
00:08:45,703 --> 00:08:48,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Calling it something new because they added some chariot racing in there.

106
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:53,748
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, if you like Prince Persia, that's going to be a pretty cool game to check out.

107
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:55,048
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

108
00:08:55,629 --> 00:09:00,132
[SPEAKER_10]: But another cool thing, though, about Prince of Persia is it's becoming a movie as well.

109
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:06,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And Disney is behind this as well as Jerry Brockheimer.

110
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,911
[SPEAKER_10]: They're bringing Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time.

111
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:11,272
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is legit.

112
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:13,213
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got some concept art on it.

113
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:15,475
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty cool.

114
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:18,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think the Sands of Time... Didn't Disney already put out Aladdin?

115
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:21,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

116
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:24,120
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it would be a pretty cool action movie.

117
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking forward to it.

118
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,462
[SPEAKER_10]: So, just don't fuck it up.

119
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:35,406
[SPEAKER_10]: You might actually have, if they pull it off, you might have a really good movie translation for a game.

120
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:36,467
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, because...

121
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:38,149
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

122
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:06,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, of course, you can download movies on iTunes, and you can download music.

123
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:09,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And for those wondering, where's all the gaming music?

124
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:15,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Electronic Arts has launched the EA Tracks service as a part of iTunes.

125
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:19,270
[SPEAKER_11]: And basically what they've done is they've compiled all the EA games.

126
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:28,955
[SPEAKER_11]: The interesting thing is they said, music from all EA games, past and present, now available on the iTunes Store.

127
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:37,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, okay, but, you know, when you say all EA games past and present, that makes me go, wow, you mean I could even go to the ECA games from the Commodore 64 days?

128
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:37,947
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

129
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:44,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically what that means, like, you know, your burnouts, your sports games with the licensed music, you know, the Maddens.

130
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:45,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Any of the games with EA tracks.

131
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,214
[SPEAKER_11]: You got it.

132
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:50,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Those EA tracks, you can download those songs on iTunes, so there you go.

133
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:55,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you know that Burnout Dominator is supposed to have Avril Lavigne's girlfriend in it?

134
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, oh boy.

135
00:10:58,848 --> 00:10:59,869
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a pretty bad song.

136
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:04,171
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the last one she did for the movie, but this song's bad.

137
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:07,332
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not something I would want the EA name on.

138
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:10,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Would it make you want to crash into things?

139
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:12,355
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a very good point.

140
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:17,077
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's true that there's pedestrians in the next Burnout game, it would make me want to run over them.

141
00:11:17,418 --> 00:11:19,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Dominator would not have pedestrians.

142
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:19,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it!

143
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:24,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Dominator's kind of a best-of built off the Revenge engine, I believe.

144
00:11:26,124 --> 00:11:26,544
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

145
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:46,626
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

146
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:27,071
[SPEAKER_08]: The first email of the week, without the sexy commentary, actually comes from... Email number one.

147
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Rob, shut up.

148
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:30,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Comes from Heon.

149
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:33,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear OLR, first of all, I absolutely love the show.

150
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:36,700
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are excellent radio show hosts and are very talented.

151
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for making the show so fun by interacting with your audience.

152
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:44,809
[SPEAKER_08]: On to my questions, Super Mario Bros., Ocarina of Time, Kid Icarus, A Link to the Past.

153
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,393
[SPEAKER_08]: These are just several of the classics that are currently available on the North American Virtual Console.

154
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:51,315
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been only four months.

155
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,697
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii still has four to five years to go.

156
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:57,219
[SPEAKER_08]: At this rate, they're going to be scraping the bottom of the barrel near the end of its life.

157
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,464
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that Nintendo's got a significant amount of masterpieces still to release on Virtual Console, but are they going too fast?

158
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:04,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Sincerely, Heon.

159
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:04,866
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

160
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:07,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I am now a Pastafarian thanks to the show.

161
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:08,689
[SPEAKER_08]: FSM lives.

162
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:10,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Flying Spaghetti Monster.

163
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:11,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

164
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,474
[SPEAKER_11]: I fear the day that Marissa has influence on anyone.

165
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:17,816
[SPEAKER_11]: All hail his noodley goodness.

166
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:18,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Love you, Marissa.

167
00:13:19,237 --> 00:13:21,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, actually, I actually... She'll be up here in two weeks.

168
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:25,963
[SPEAKER_11]: She's coming back a lot sooner than we thought, so that's going to be a very interesting program.

169
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:30,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, back to the content of the email.

170
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:32,088
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the email about again?

171
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:35,351
[SPEAKER_07]: About if Nintendo's releasing... whatever, Rob.

172
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:38,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Virtual console games coming out too fast or whatever's going on.

173
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:40,040
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, no.

174
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,622
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, keep in mind what we were talking about earlier in the program, that there's this big drought going on with the games.

175
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:56,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And although Reggie Fils-Aimé lied and said we wouldn't have these droughts this time around, keep in mind one thing he did say is that the virtual console releases, the big ones, would supplement the lack of Wii games during these slow periods.

176
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:01,610
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think right now, no, they're not necessarily doing the virtual console games too fast.

177
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:07,033
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this was probably a pretty decent time to release Ocarina and Kid Icarus and some of those really big titles people want.

178
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,527
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

179
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,780
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

180
00:14:57,391 --> 00:15:00,953
[SPEAKER_11]: and hopefully someday we'll start getting the multiplayer add-ons.

181
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe some of our games will be enabled for multiplayer slowly but surely.

182
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:05,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll get our cheat codes.

183
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:08,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I could see that as something that happens slowly but surely in 2008.

184
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:10,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Icarus to fight Medusa Angels.

185
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:12,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want my Justin Bailey in Metroid.

186
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:14,319
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully originals too.

187
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't we want some Wii originals?

188
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Some more original Wii games?

189
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:18,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Heck yeah.

190
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:21,603
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would be hopefully where the console goes in 2008 and 2009.

191
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:23,144
[SPEAKER_11]: So we will see what happens.

192
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:25,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Next email is very special.

193
00:15:26,713 --> 00:15:29,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear OLR crew, my name is Ranma from Indonesia.

194
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:31,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a classic video game lover.

195
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:36,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that I am probably the first person from Indonesia becoming one of your loyal fans.

196
00:15:37,674 --> 00:15:38,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I have to know.

197
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to check stats.

198
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:43,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now I'm working as a journalist in most of my articles about technology and video games.

199
00:15:43,637 --> 00:15:46,039
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also working as a local video game music composer.

200
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,281
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that will probably surprise you is that I am blind.

201
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:52,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I was born with only 10% sight ability after being operated.

202
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:55,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Now how can I operate a computer?

203
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:59,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm using screen reader that enables me to read objects shown on my laptop so I can read and write.

204
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,062
[SPEAKER_08]: and even download your show.

205
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:06,706
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was a child, I was so interested in video games because it had attractive sounds and graphics.

206
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:12,631
[SPEAKER_08]: I even owned an Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, NES, Genesis and SNES.

207
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:15,673
[SPEAKER_08]: With only 10% sight, I could still enjoy classic games.

208
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:21,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I could not recognize objects or details, but I could still understand, for instance, which one is my hero and which one is the enemy.

209
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:26,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I even finished many famous classic games such as Super Mario series, Contra Gradius,

210
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:34,622
[SPEAKER_08]: and many more, but when 3D gaming era came out, Playstation, Nintendo 64 and Saturn, I decided to give up because I could not play games with so many movements.

211
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:39,144
[SPEAKER_08]: After that, I decided to enjoy video games in other fashions.

212
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:43,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I started to record or collect music from games I played.

213
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:45,947
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll share you some of my listening later.

214
00:16:46,387 --> 00:16:48,148
[SPEAKER_08]: So now on to my comments about you guys.

215
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:49,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Scroll down.

216
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:53,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I could not say a word but awesome.

217
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:57,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Your podcast is the first experience enjoying video games news on an audio form.

218
00:16:58,187 --> 00:17:00,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually found your site last January and started to become your fan.

219
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:02,808
[SPEAKER_08]: I even noticed some of your information.

220
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:05,429
[SPEAKER_08]: I even quoted some of your information in my articles.

221
00:17:06,129 --> 00:17:11,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, you are the craziest gang I have ever loved.

222
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:16,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like having lots of friends video game folks that refreshes my energy and brain during the working hour.

223
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:18,933
[SPEAKER_08]: You should know that not many Indonesians

224
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:20,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

225
00:17:37,472 --> 00:17:37,932
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

226
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,882
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes advantage of stereo sound systems.

227
00:17:58,982 --> 00:18:04,584
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, if you're playing a spaceship battle game and your enemy is on your left, you can hear their ship on your left speaker and can shoot them.

228
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:07,024
[SPEAKER_08]: You can also chase them if they dodge your attack.

229
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:09,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's say they move from left to right.

230
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to scroll down.

231
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:13,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, pay attention to the speaker.

232
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:16,827
[SPEAKER_08]: They did something like that with that Atari controller that you use your forehead to play.

233
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:21,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sega did a couple of audio-only games on the Saturn.

234
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,242
[SPEAKER_08]: You can try them here.

235
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,503
[SPEAKER_08]: It's at audiogames.net.

236
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:27,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if it can be DarkSakura's side of the week.

237
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:27,905
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

238
00:18:29,266 --> 00:18:30,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think that's all I can share.

239
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:33,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope I keep in touch with you guys.

240
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:35,210
[SPEAKER_08]: This email can be read on air.

241
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:41,635
[SPEAKER_08]: As for joining your show via Skype, I think it is difficult because the connection, like I've mentioned before, is very slow to make such a call.

242
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:43,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus the time difference.

243
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:51,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, I'm working on an Xbox 360 project along with a local game developer at max-studio.net to produce independent games.

244
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,400
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

245
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:16,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, what an amazing email.

246
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:18,206
[SPEAKER_11]: That was really cool.

247
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:37,660
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

248
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,310
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

249
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:42,413
[SPEAKER_08]: They were talking about how they had a group of blind people riding their bicycle down the road using clicking to determine location of cars and other things in the road.

250
00:20:43,114 --> 00:20:57,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And that their study group actually managed to avoid children running out in the road, avoided trash in the street, by using their sense of hearing

251
00:20:58,534 --> 00:21:02,277
[SPEAKER_08]: to determine space relation around them.

252
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:12,124
[SPEAKER_08]: They say that if you lose one capability, your other capabilities become so much more sensitive, so that really makes sense, I think.

253
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:18,969
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be very curious what this listener has to think about the Wii, because he does have at least the 10% site.

254
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:31,947
[SPEAKER_11]: The Wii is interesting because it has that rumble and the speaker that's actually in the Wiimote, as well as the rumble, depending on where your cursor is on screen, that could help you identify if you're pointing at a certain object.

255
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:44,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I imagine not all games would work, but I'm kind of curious, could the Wii maybe be something that would help bring this guy back into gaming, where the 3D games and the ultra-intensive graphics have kind of made him unable to play?

256
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:49,553
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have never known about this type of site and the way they make these games.

257
00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:51,737
[SPEAKER_11]: and I guess I'm just ignorant that way.

258
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,258
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have never known had it not been for this email.

259
00:21:53,318 --> 00:21:54,799
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much for the email.

260
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,462
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to check that site out just because I want to know.

261
00:21:57,522 --> 00:21:59,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see what kind of games there are.

262
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:08,491
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been other games, and I don't think they were necessarily brought out for the blind in particular, but Sega, there were a number of Saturn games that focused only on audio.

263
00:22:08,992 --> 00:22:14,857
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one game that came with a packet of seeds where you had to use the audio to raise a plant.

264
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting.

265
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Alpha Canogram reminds us, and SSJ100 Matt chimes in too, about how Ellen actually gave a blind kid a Wii on her show.

266
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:22,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember that?

267
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:24,225
[SPEAKER_11]: That was some gaming news a while back.

268
00:22:24,905 --> 00:22:26,326
[SPEAKER_11]: That was before the Wiis were even out.

269
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:30,789
[SPEAKER_11]: So kind of an interesting reminder there from the chat room.

270
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,010
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why we love chat, because they remember things and we don't.

271
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:35,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this next email comes from BearWhoDriveCar.

272
00:22:36,452 --> 00:22:36,933
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that name.

273
00:22:37,353 --> 00:22:37,853
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so great.

274
00:22:39,715 --> 00:22:40,355
[SPEAKER_08]: French fries, sorry.

275
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:42,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I have to stop for just a minute.

276
00:22:42,873 --> 00:22:44,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, what the hell is it?

277
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,854
[SPEAKER_11]: You have DDR5thMix on your PSP?

278
00:22:46,094 --> 00:22:46,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

279
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:47,295
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you hacking over there?

280
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:51,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I was putting a PS1 image on here.

281
00:22:51,477 --> 00:22:54,658
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know it... God, I'm so far behind on my PlayStation.

282
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Dang, you mean if I get a card you can do that with PlayStation 1 games for my PSP?

283
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:09,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you put a custom firmware on there and you can convert any PS1 image to play on a PSP given that you have the big enough... Now my next question for you is why the fuck do you have

284
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:11,196
[SPEAKER_11]: and DDDR on your PSP.

285
00:23:12,297 --> 00:23:13,198
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can play with the controller.

286
00:23:14,418 --> 00:23:15,499
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how I play normally.

287
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Back to the emails.

288
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:16,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

289
00:23:17,941 --> 00:23:18,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

290
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:21,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, just writing to Vent about the Wii.

291
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:23,945
[SPEAKER_08]: I do like it, but you guys mentioned that there are too many controllers.

292
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:25,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I can't agree more.

293
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:26,967
[SPEAKER_08]: First, I got Super Mario Bros.

294
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:27,648
[SPEAKER_08]: with the Wiimote.

295
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:31,191
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of odd because of the shape and size, but that was okay.

296
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:32,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I got Smash Bros.

297
00:23:32,592 --> 00:23:35,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Melee, and all of a sudden, to play multiplayer, I needed two GameCube controllers.

298
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:37,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, not too bad.

299
00:23:37,734 --> 00:23:49,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I bought Contra, and that's when I noticed if you try to play with the GameCube controller, I try to play with the GameCube controller, but if you recall the locations, the YB on SNES and Game Boy controllers are totally different.

300
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:52,768
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, I hate the GameCube controller and its asymmetrically sized buttons.

301
00:23:53,228 --> 00:23:55,731
[SPEAKER_08]: So now I have to buy a Wii Classic controller, two for multiplayer.

302
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:58,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I've also purchased three Wiimotes and four Nunchucks.

303
00:23:58,473 --> 00:24:00,735
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Nintendo Wii, $250, three Wiimotes, $120, four Nunchucks, $80.

304
00:24:03,948 --> 00:24:07,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I get the point, but at the same time, you didn't have to buy the controllers.

305
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:10,049
[SPEAKER_08]: You just didn't like the way it felt on the GameCube controllers.

306
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:13,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, you're not forced to even buy Contra or any Super Nintendo game at all.

307
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas PlayStation 3...

308
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:36,873
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to buy a Blu-ray drive, like it or not.

309
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,810
[SPEAKER_11]: and so on and so on.

310
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:28,684
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you want to get a wireless headset, that's more money.

311
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:33,407
[SPEAKER_11]: And I say, yeah, you kind of do need that wireless headset if I want to play DDR or so on.

312
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:38,889
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyhow, interesting point, but I think a slightly flawed one.

313
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

314
00:25:41,771 --> 00:25:48,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that there's something to it, but it all depends on how far you'll go for the sake of convenience.

315
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, next email comes up.

316
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:54,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, could I just say some quick points from chat that came up here?

317
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:55,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see what's going on.

318
00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:58,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Heon wants to start a fight here.

319
00:25:59,194 --> 00:26:01,435
[SPEAKER_11]: You are not good enough for the GameCube controller, you noob.

320
00:26:02,015 --> 00:26:05,256
[SPEAKER_11]: And Blaze says, boo-fucking-hoo, do your research before you buy a system.

321
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:06,877
[SPEAKER_11]: So a couple of people throwing some rocks there.

322
00:26:07,657 --> 00:26:12,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Sky Warrior, that's with a Y, not an I, says, value, what makes the Wii so compelling?

323
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:15,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Too bad the PlayStation 3 has no value as of now.

324
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:16,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting.

325
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,061
[SPEAKER_11]: And some interesting comments there from the chat room there.

326
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:24,482
[SPEAKER_11]: James Patrick says, a lot of Wii games only need one remote and you pass it around.

327
00:26:25,174 --> 00:26:26,415
[SPEAKER_11]: So, kind of interesting there.

328
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:27,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, food.

329
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:36,642
[SPEAKER_10]: And also they have games, they have games like coming out now like Wing Island and Kororimpa that use one remote and nunchuck for two players.

330
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:39,144
[SPEAKER_10]: So, they've got all that stuff going on.

331
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:42,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie's got a mouth.

332
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:44,267
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want that now after you put your mouth all over it.

333
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:45,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I only ate off one side of it.

334
00:26:45,468 --> 00:26:45,808
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fine.

335
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:47,629
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't look that good anyway.

336
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:49,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm starting South Beach tomorrow again.

337
00:26:49,371 --> 00:26:49,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

338
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:50,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

339
00:26:51,672 --> 00:26:52,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Last email.

340
00:26:52,533 --> 00:26:53,673
[SPEAKER_08]: This email actually is not the last one.

341
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:54,354
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes from Necky.

342
00:26:57,864 --> 00:27:24,484
[SPEAKER_08]: really the one thing that I wanted to go in here and it's a really long email and this is going to be one that I'm going to leave on the website but I wanted to mention this I like the idea of telling people now you've posted a site plug for you on my home forum dscommunity.co.uk to plug the site for them and xbox360fanatics link is z6.envisionfree.com slash 360 underscore fanatics slash index dot php

343
00:27:25,114 --> 00:27:30,598
[SPEAKER_08]: We are currently quite small, but invite everyone to join no matter where you are, and that includes you, Jamie, Loki, and Rob.

344
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:42,187
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to do that, though, just because Neki writes us regularly, and I'm going to be posting this in the thing, but I thought that it would be nice for me to go ahead and give the little plug.

345
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:51,634
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also another bit in here that says, I remember the first email of last from the taped segment was a loving rant about the last few episodes.

346
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:53,516
[SPEAKER_08]: I, too, feel slightly likewise, but I agree.

347
00:27:54,412 --> 00:27:58,635
[SPEAKER_08]: with you, Jamie and Rob, that it does keep your show unique.

348
00:27:58,695 --> 00:28:02,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Inviting Casper the Gay and Rice Princess every week may not be such a good idea, though.

349
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:07,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not hold anything against them, but having them on every week would alter many people's views of your show.

350
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:10,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's why these folks are guests, not hosts.

351
00:28:11,142 --> 00:28:12,623
[SPEAKER_08]: They said it out of love, not hate.

352
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:13,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

353
00:28:13,784 --> 00:28:15,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that one's going to get reposted.

354
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:20,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I'm actually trying to do a search.

355
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see where this post comes up.

356
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,761
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking at this site.

357
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,641
[SPEAKER_11]: DScommunity.co.uk.

358
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:26,122
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a whole little DS.

359
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:27,923
[SPEAKER_11]: And I imagine there's lots of friend code training going on.

360
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:28,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, here it is.

361
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:30,764
[SPEAKER_11]: There's actually a forum called Plug A Site.

362
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:33,365
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's this post there.

363
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:38,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Great site for podcasts and live shows focusing on video gaming.

364
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:40,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Podcasts available on iTunes.

365
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:42,189
[SPEAKER_11]: MP3 download available on actual website.

366
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:44,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Covers release dates for most of the world.

367
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Most are accurate as they have insider sources.

368
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,051
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the guys works for a game distribution company.

369
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:51,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Good fun to listen to, especially when you have nothing to do or on a commute.

370
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,029
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that.

371
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:53,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Launch Radio, better than nothing.

372
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

373
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:57,012
[SPEAKER_11]: No, thank you very much for the plug.

374
00:28:57,292 --> 00:28:58,032
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate that.

375
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:01,715
[SPEAKER_11]: You are a true veteran of the OL Army, and we salute you.

376
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:06,838
[SPEAKER_08]: We got an email from Gaming Nerd about... Nerd.

377
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:09,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, now.

378
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:10,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway...

379
00:29:13,746 --> 00:29:19,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, OLR, I know this is kind of a risky subject to mention, but I feel it must be heard so that people understand what could be happening in the future in gaming.

380
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:30,519
[SPEAKER_08]: After listening to Loki's rant in the last week's episode about there not being any good games for PS3 and 360, and only average ones, it got me looking back at the numerous anonymous sites that I've been to.

381
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:38,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm finding it pretty easy to download pirated PS2 and Xbox games off the net and burning them to DVD-Rs and playing them on modded consoles.

382
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:46,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Knowing how easy it is to download PS2 and Xbox games, it gets you wondering just how much money game companies are losing just from these two consoles.

383
00:29:47,332 --> 00:29:55,354
[SPEAKER_08]: With that loss in money, there's only so much money that can be spent to produce average titles with the kind of graphics power and development tools that are provided for the PS3 and 360.

384
00:29:55,654 --> 00:30:05,356
[SPEAKER_08]: It's no wonder that Wii is overtaking the competition with its console for the simple reason that GameCube ran games off any unique media that wasn't easily accessible to the public.

385
00:30:06,297 --> 00:30:07,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Thus, more money was earned

386
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:09,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

387
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:38,243
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll only be a matter of time before we see a Blu-ray burner and PS3 games get pirated.

388
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:43,766
[SPEAKER_08]: A mod chip is released to the console, which will result in even more money lost to the companies that make their games for the PS3.

389
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:52,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm even more surprised the Japanese market isn't complaining about piracy, but that you could only mean there's much more loyalty to gaming than some of us here in the States.

390
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:58,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially when it comes to buying my PS2 imports, I'm more than willing to spend $64 to buy games like Puyo Puyo Fever 2

391
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:14,296
[SPEAKER_08]: MeltyBlood, DDR Supernova, Beatmania2DX and supporting the companies that made these games and like most people that I've heard who just go ahead and download imports since they either can't find the store that sells them or don't want to spend an extra $14 off everyday $50 US titles that might have just come out.

392
00:31:15,637 --> 00:31:24,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, I hope this letter gives a better understanding as to why big names aren't really as big anymore as it partially is due to the loss of money and loss of quality for the games themselves.

393
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:30,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I can remember when it was really big news for a game like Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo, and Final Fantasy to get new sequels.

394
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,864
[SPEAKER_08]: But nowadays, it's just the same thing because there is enough money to do much else in the games.

395
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:41,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Unique aspects are gone and there's not much else we can say about gaming other than stop the piracy and the magical return.

396
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:43,130
[SPEAKER_08]: You're truly a gaming nerd.

397
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,255
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not often you hear from people who are willing to defend the fact that video game piracy is a bad thing.

398
00:31:50,095 --> 00:31:51,737
[SPEAKER_11]: So, very interesting email.

399
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:53,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't copy that floppy.

400
00:31:54,093 --> 00:32:01,719
[SPEAKER_11]: As a famous musician once said, Loki, I'm curious what your feedback is on this whole piracy is bad for the industry angle.

401
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:12,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, it's bad for the industry, but, you know, to be honest, nowadays, a lot of stuff, if it's not worth playing, I won't even go and pirate it or anything like that.

402
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:15,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just not play it, but, I mean...

403
00:32:16,383 --> 00:32:24,585
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, I buy normally, I mean, I buy a lot of stuff that just comes out and I find out, you know, the hard way that a lot of the games do suck.

404
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:31,106
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can see where a lot of people get burned by these games that, you know, get great reviews and they're like, what the fuck, this is crap.

405
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:33,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Driver 3, for example.

406
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:44,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, piracy is, especially if you make it so easy like it is on the PlayStation 2 or even the original PlayStation, yeah, it's going to be a huge issue, but

407
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:46,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

408
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:47,684
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all morals.

409
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:50,246
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think stealing's bad, then you're not going to do it.

410
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:53,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Bandit says, bad for the industry, but good for Loki.

411
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:54,950
[SPEAKER_11]: In our chatroom.

412
00:32:58,553 --> 00:33:02,777
[SPEAKER_11]: GS68 says, I buy legit copies, though I admit I've done my share of ROM downloading.

413
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:06,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I think ROMs are not quite as bad.

414
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,625
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, they're really not as bad, because usually the things you're pirating ROMs of, I mean, if you're doing current DS games, that's one thing.

415
00:33:12,964 --> 00:33:13,504
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR5thMix Virtual Console

416
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:44,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a ROM of Kid Icarus on my computer.

417
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:47,310
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like to play Kid Icarus on my computer.

418
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,131
[SPEAKER_11]: I like to play it on my television like I did when I was a kid.

419
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:54,653
[SPEAKER_11]: So for that, it was worth the $5 to me because I love Kid Icarus that much.

420
00:33:55,053 --> 00:33:59,075
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, I've got to play PS1 games on my PSP because what else am I going to play?

421
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:00,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Grand Theft Auto?

422
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:01,312
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously.

423
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:03,252
[SPEAKER_10]: What else is out for the PSP?

424
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:06,713
[SPEAKER_10]: A whole lot of stuff I'm not interested in.

425
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:08,734
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like a lot of stuff coming soon, though.

426
00:34:09,854 --> 00:34:10,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Soon.

427
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:11,415
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always coming soon.

428
00:34:11,435 --> 00:34:12,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever, whatever.

429
00:34:13,556 --> 00:34:14,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, may I read the next email?

430
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:15,916
[SPEAKER_11]: You sure may.

431
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:16,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

432
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:17,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Last email.

433
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:19,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Hiya, guys.

434
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:24,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to know what it is that we in Europe and Australia have done to piss off Sony.

435
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever it was, I'm sure we could apologize.

436
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:29,627
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the funny accents.

437
00:34:30,547 --> 00:34:31,268
[SPEAKER_08]: No, shut up.

438
00:34:33,209 --> 00:34:35,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe come to some kind of arrangement.

439
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,231
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't get this kind of treatment in America.

440
00:34:37,271 --> 00:34:37,711
[SPEAKER_08]: How come?

441
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:39,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it cash bribes, sexual favors?

442
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:43,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you know why it is I'm feeling hard done by.

443
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:47,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I was accepting of the higher price tag.

444
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:48,316
[SPEAKER_08]: We are used to that.

445
00:34:48,957 --> 00:34:52,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the late release date, I've only just bought my copy of Final Fantasy XII.

446
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:53,859
[SPEAKER_08]: We're used to having to wait.

447
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:57,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Waiting longer to pay extra for an inferior piece of hardware is taking the biscuit.

448
00:34:58,015 --> 00:34:59,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Full backwards compatibility.

449
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:00,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's another thing.

450
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:01,757
[SPEAKER_11]: You call it a biscuit.

451
00:35:01,897 --> 00:35:02,718
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on.

452
00:35:03,058 --> 00:35:03,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob!

453
00:35:03,258 --> 00:35:04,259
[SPEAKER_11]: My expression is take the cake.

454
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:07,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

455
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

456
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:07,821
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

457
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:09,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just, obviously I'm kidding.

458
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:10,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

459
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:10,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Stuff it!

460
00:35:11,323 --> 00:35:11,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

461
00:35:13,464 --> 00:35:15,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to flip Jamie off the British way.

462
00:35:15,665 --> 00:35:16,085
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

463
00:35:16,565 --> 00:35:17,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Up your arse.

464
00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:18,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, two-finger salute for you.

465
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:22,209
[SPEAKER_11]: You're being a real tit.

466
00:35:23,769 --> 00:35:24,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't be such a tit.

467
00:35:30,391 --> 00:35:30,711
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm done.

468
00:35:31,232 --> 00:35:31,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I promise.

469
00:35:31,913 --> 00:35:38,018
[SPEAKER_08]: To use a bit of proper colloquialism, Rob's doing my head in here.

470
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:39,700
[SPEAKER_08]: So shall I continue?

471
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:40,861
[SPEAKER_11]: I suppose.

472
00:35:40,881 --> 00:35:41,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

473
00:35:42,222 --> 00:35:42,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Wanker.

474
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:47,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Full backwards compatibility was one of the biggest selling...

475
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:51,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Points for the PS2 from me and would have been on the PS3.

476
00:35:51,473 --> 00:35:59,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Being able to play a session of San Andreas and putting on Bishi Bashi Special if mates come over without switching consoles or messing with wires is important to me.

477
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yes, this guy.

478
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:00,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

479
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing work.

480
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Bandit calls this whole thing bullocks.

481
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:34,699
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what Bandit has to say about it.

482
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:38,221
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, here's why... I offered you some.

483
00:36:38,241 --> 00:36:39,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't give me that look.

484
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:39,562
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

485
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,822
[SPEAKER_07]: You look at my cupcake.

486
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:43,824
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like a yummy cupcake, but I don't want it.

487
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:45,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Cupcakes make me fat.

488
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want it.

489
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:48,687
[SPEAKER_11]: You put your fingers all over that cupcake.

490
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:50,768
[SPEAKER_11]: You haven't even, like, torn off the paper.

491
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:52,849
[SPEAKER_11]: You've just dived into the cupcake.

492
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:56,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked you if you wanted some, and you said no, so I started licking the ice.

493
00:36:56,691 --> 00:36:57,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't be such a twat.

494
00:37:04,273 --> 00:37:08,714
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the reason why Europe gets shit on is I think they sell the least amount of consoles there.

495
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:09,274
[SPEAKER_11]: The end.

496
00:37:09,715 --> 00:37:09,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

497
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:10,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I right?

498
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:12,295
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

499
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:13,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki says I'm wrong.

500
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:16,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think that's what it is.

501
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:17,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

502
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't they sell more consoles in Japan and America than they do in Europe?

503
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:25,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

504
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:27,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it depends what you consider to be Europe.

505
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:32,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you consider Europe to be everything on the other side of the Atlantic?

506
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:36,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do you consider Europe to be, you know... I just think that they think that their U.S.

507
00:37:36,814 --> 00:37:39,076
[SPEAKER_10]: and Japan markets are more important than their U.K.

508
00:37:39,116 --> 00:37:43,779
[SPEAKER_10]: markets, and they want to make sure they have enough consoles for us because we're spending more money on games.

509
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:51,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I always said the TVs, too, because the Japan and U.S.

510
00:37:51,465 --> 00:37:55,388
[SPEAKER_11]: share the same TV format standard, whereas NTSC... It doesn't matter with HD.

511
00:37:56,241 --> 00:38:00,004
[SPEAKER_08]: If Sony's really pushing the HD format, then having PAL or NTSC is not going to matter.

512
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:08,991
[SPEAKER_11]: But, not everybody has an HD TV yet, so the systems have to work with the old TVs, whether they are this, you know, whoring up the HD signal or not.

513
00:38:09,011 --> 00:38:09,972
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be pretty easy to do, though.

514
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:10,792
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think.

515
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:11,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a thought.

516
00:38:11,673 --> 00:38:12,754
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just processing a lot here.

517
00:38:12,774 --> 00:38:18,018
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to figure out what components they're going to take out of your PS3 so that they can lower the price on their end.

518
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:19,719
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they have to do.

519
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:22,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well.

520
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:23,561
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know.

521
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:24,942
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's a Sony question.

522
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:26,822
[SPEAKER_11]: We've given you our thoughts, though.

523
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:34,585
[SPEAKER_11]: And regardless, it's not nice that they keep giving you the shaft over there on the different games.

524
00:38:35,485 --> 00:38:35,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob.

525
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:36,305
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

526
00:38:37,886 --> 00:38:38,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, no.

527
00:38:38,426 --> 00:38:42,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, the international listeners ought to know I love them.

528
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:44,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I tease because I love.

529
00:38:44,568 --> 00:38:46,829
[SPEAKER_11]: And as somebody in chats, I don't even know who said this here.

530
00:38:48,169 --> 00:38:50,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Who said my accents were so bad they were good?

531
00:38:51,561 --> 00:38:58,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody there said my accents are so bad they're funny.

532
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:04,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Uni says Sky's accents are like my mom trying to do a British accent and completely miserably failing at it.

533
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:06,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh goody, now I'm like your mom.

534
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:07,547
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a very nice compliment.

535
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:09,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Like your mom.

536
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:13,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio, it's like your mom.

537
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:15,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Go leave that on an iTunes review.

538
00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:21,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I want one of our British listeners to record that for us so that we can make a bumper out of it.

539
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:22,563
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to bring back the bumpers.

540
00:39:22,883 --> 00:39:23,444
[SPEAKER_11]: I miss the bumper.

541
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:23,964
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

542
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:24,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lingerie.

543
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:25,645
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like your mom.

544
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:27,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I could do that better.

545
00:39:28,688 --> 00:39:29,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I could do that better.

546
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:29,588
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

547
00:39:29,608 --> 00:39:29,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

548
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:30,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Forget it.

549
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:31,109
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously.

550
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:31,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I could.

551
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Any more emails?

552
00:39:32,731 --> 00:39:33,291
[SPEAKER_11]: That was it, right?

553
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Mailbag at OrangeLingerie.com.

554
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:35,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Send us more.

555
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:37,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Send emails.

556
00:39:37,895 --> 00:39:39,296
[SPEAKER_11]: My accent wants some fan mails.

557
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:43,739
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to do one that says, you lose because we say so.

558
00:39:45,217 --> 00:40:13,592
[SPEAKER_10]: So... So anyways, apparently the rumor is much like the, you know, online libraries, they are also withholding the Mii libraries for the Nintendo Wii from third-party developers and not letting them develop games that will utilize the Miis, which is kind of disappointing because I would like to use my Miis in a lot more things than just, you know, Wii Sports or WarioWare, I guess.

559
00:40:14,193 --> 00:40:14,553
[SPEAKER_10]: But, um...

560
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:15,776
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see why they don't.

561
00:40:15,796 --> 00:40:17,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't use your me's in Grand Theft Auto.

562
00:40:18,278 --> 00:40:19,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, that would be awesome.

563
00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:21,280
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be so cool.

564
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:31,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Even stuff just like maybe your face or something on SSX Blur or something like that.

565
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:31,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Or your mom.

566
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,812
[SPEAKER_11]: You could literally put your mom in the game.

567
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:37,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that, yeah.

568
00:40:37,837 --> 00:40:39,277
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know why they don't.

569
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:45,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's stupid, but if it's anything like the online stuff was, they want to make sure they get it right first before they put it out to everybody.

570
00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:48,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is a poor excuse if you ask me, but whatever.

571
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:54,266
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'm sure, like the online, it'll be something that's implemented later on.

572
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:59,428
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, while it may not be happening now, it will happen later.

573
00:40:59,548 --> 00:41:01,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the third parties will get their me's soon enough.

574
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I agree, they should have had it from the start.

575
00:41:05,372 --> 00:41:05,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, um...

576
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:15,807
[SPEAKER_11]: GameTap, we mentioned in Part A when I was talking about Myst Online, and what should be noted is that GameTap is also now starting to really get behind the independent game movement.

577
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Seems like a really good fit for GameTap, if you ask me.

578
00:41:19,248 --> 00:41:29,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, GameTap has announced they're going to be doing a new indie game label, and what they're going to do, they're going to sign and distribute any worthy indie project over the GameTap service.

579
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:32,994
[SPEAKER_11]: And this would be a really great way to get your game out there, because GameTap has their user base.

580
00:41:33,014 --> 00:41:35,935
[SPEAKER_11]: They won't say how big it is, which makes me think it's not that big.

581
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:37,116
[SPEAKER_11]: GameTap.com

582
00:42:06,004 --> 00:42:06,745
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of cool.

583
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:10,649
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Loki, is this something that might get you on GameTap finally?

584
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:10,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

585
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:14,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have time to be paying for online monthly subscriptions for games.

586
00:42:15,153 --> 00:42:16,374
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I'd ask anyway.

587
00:42:17,896 --> 00:42:19,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, excuse me.

588
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:21,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I was just choking up a baby.

589
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

590
00:42:26,063 --> 00:42:28,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently this show has that effect on people.

591
00:42:29,887 --> 00:42:30,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

592
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:30,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

593
00:42:31,286 --> 00:42:37,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I just coughed up a baby listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

594
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:43,189
[SPEAKER_11]: They were talking about babies flying out of vaginas in one part, and in the second part, they coughed up a baby.

595
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:44,549
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing.

596
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:52,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, there is some love coming out thanks to SNK.

597
00:42:52,951 --> 00:42:58,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Art of Fighting actually is going to be having a collection to be released stateside.

598
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:14,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Art of Fighting was a very interesting game because it was a big, definite knockoff in some respects of Street Fighter II, what with, you know, Rio and Robert Garcia and all of them.

599
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:18,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the two of them also gave us Dan and later ones, too.

600
00:43:19,032 --> 00:43:20,093
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

601
00:43:20,593 --> 00:43:21,213
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of cool.

602
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:24,074
[SPEAKER_11]: I always liked Art of Fighting because they did name a fighter after me.

603
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:25,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Having a Rob in a fighting game was pretty cool.

604
00:43:26,915 --> 00:43:29,476
[SPEAKER_11]: I also like that old school zoom in and out effect it did.

605
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:32,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Art of Fighting, though, gave us King.

606
00:43:32,324 --> 00:43:32,804
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

607
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:34,124
[SPEAKER_08]: And King was awesome.

608
00:43:34,605 --> 00:43:35,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Big ol' lesbian.

609
00:43:36,185 --> 00:43:36,605
[SPEAKER_08]: And Yuri.

610
00:43:37,005 --> 00:43:37,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

611
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:38,526
[SPEAKER_08]: With the flying butt attack.

612
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:43,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Gotta love flying butt attacks.

613
00:43:43,927 --> 00:43:47,409
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I'm gonna do a flying butt attack on DarkSakura right now.

614
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:48,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your ass off me!

615
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been rubbed with gay ass.

616
00:43:52,541 --> 00:44:02,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, if you like ridiculous weapons much like Rob's flying butt attack, then you're definitely going to love Worms HD, which is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

617
00:44:02,543 --> 00:44:03,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of ass worms.

618
00:44:03,824 --> 00:44:06,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, this Wednesday.

619
00:44:07,005 --> 00:44:08,865
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is awesome.

620
00:44:08,925 --> 00:44:12,406
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be 800 Microsoft points or $10 in real money.

621
00:44:13,366 --> 00:44:15,127
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's awesome.

622
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:15,747
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Worms.

623
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:16,567
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 2D.

624
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:19,528
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yeah, I can't wait to play it.

625
00:44:20,174 --> 00:44:21,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh lord, bless this thy hand grenade

626
00:44:34,366 --> 00:44:35,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam & Max GameTap

627
00:44:56,624 --> 00:45:00,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Telltale Games finally said something this week about the whole thing.

628
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:05,628
[SPEAKER_11]: They said they will, quote, look closely at releasing a potential Sam & Max project.

629
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:13,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Quote, we can confirm that we are hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, although we do not have any official Xbox project announcements to share right now.

630
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:18,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I would think if they're hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, they've got something planned.

631
00:45:18,455 --> 00:45:19,015
[SPEAKER_11]: And what else?

632
00:45:19,534 --> 00:45:20,454
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura's Website of the Week

633
00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:00,913
[SPEAKER_08]: My website of the week is a marvelously special one.

634
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:05,056
[SPEAKER_08]: It is marvel.com, which I've been spending a whole shitload of time on.

635
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:08,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Downloading, actually mostly just downloading wallpaper.

636
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:18,188
[SPEAKER_08]: But they have, I think it's cool, they actually have some of the, I'd say comics from like a few months ago uploaded so that you can read them.

637
00:46:18,228 --> 00:46:20,210
[SPEAKER_08]: They have links to the toys, the movie news.

638
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:25,986
[SPEAKER_08]: There's blogs up there, podcasts, stuff for mobile.

639
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:27,127
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually pretty cool.

640
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:29,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been pretty happy with it.

641
00:46:30,007 --> 00:46:32,428
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd say check it out.

642
00:46:32,528 --> 00:46:33,168
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really fun.

643
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:36,689
[SPEAKER_08]: For a commercial site.

644
00:46:38,749 --> 00:46:39,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

645
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,970
[SPEAKER_08]: What, are you surprised?

646
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:43,250
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm just reading chat.

647
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,671
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm arguing with Black Wolf right now in chat.

648
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Rob, do your job.

649
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:57,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki's friend is fighting me in chat right now, Loki's one friend, saying that it's going to be hard to fit Sam and Max on Xbox Live Arcade because of the size limit.

650
00:46:57,686 --> 00:47:00,607
[SPEAKER_11]: And I said, well, they upped the size limit to 250 megabytes, remember?

651
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:03,388
[SPEAKER_11]: And BlackWolf says, yes, they'd have to make it more, though.

652
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:08,491
[SPEAKER_11]: And BlackWolf says, I just don't want 360 people to get my Sam and Max hard game tab.

653
00:47:09,851 --> 00:47:10,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, so that's sort of true.

654
00:47:10,852 --> 00:47:14,254
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want people to have your Loki, and you don't want people to have your Sam and Max.

655
00:47:14,274 --> 00:47:14,974
[SPEAKER_11]: You are a very

656
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Possessive individual, Mr. Bobby Blackwolf

657
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:51,131
[SPEAKER_10]: So apparently they've spotted a couple games on the Vice, or I see VC and I think Vice City.

658
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:59,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Virtual console servers, because I know you can still do that little hack with the web browsers to view what's on those.

659
00:47:59,714 --> 00:48:07,497
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, two games that have been spotted, one of them being Elevator Action, which is pretty awesome, and then Tecmo Bowl.

660
00:48:08,726 --> 00:48:09,246
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not.

661
00:48:09,426 --> 00:48:10,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Elevator Action sucks.

662
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:11,967
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of those games people remember.

663
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:12,988
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Tecmo Bowl.

664
00:48:13,128 --> 00:48:14,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Tecmo Bowl's awesome.

665
00:48:14,688 --> 00:48:15,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, fuck Elevator Action.

666
00:48:15,969 --> 00:48:19,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Tecmo Bowl on the NES was awesome, but Tecmo Bowl on the arcade was not so awesome.

667
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:28,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I have the Tecmo Bowl arcade game on some Tecmo collection I have on the Xbox randomly, but Tecmo Bowl on NES was pretty rad.

668
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,574
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm looking forward to seeing that.

669
00:48:30,614 --> 00:48:31,414
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be pretty cool.

670
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:33,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Elevator Action, not so much.

671
00:48:33,295 --> 00:48:34,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Elevator Action was not that good.

672
00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:37,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob the Robot Rob the Robot

673
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:08,109
[SPEAKER_11]: How about Rob Roberts, the bot?

674
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:08,889
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be good.

675
00:49:09,009 --> 00:49:09,510
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

676
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,132
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to bring back... How about a Jamie bot where it just nags you to do things?

677
00:49:15,212 --> 00:49:16,553
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a woman bot, okay?

678
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:18,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Turn on your system!

679
00:49:18,934 --> 00:49:20,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Download this upgrade!

680
00:49:21,756 --> 00:49:22,236
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

681
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:26,078
[SPEAKER_08]: I only called you once today to ask you to turn on your aim so I could send you the fucking pre-show.

682
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:28,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not be a bitch to me, Rob.

683
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:29,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Turn on your AOL.

684
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,223
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think that I'm going to download your updates for you, you're completely wrong.

685
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,452
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm an independent woman.

686
00:49:38,492 --> 00:49:39,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll do what I want.

687
00:49:41,254 --> 00:49:43,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm setting up in the middle of your game now.

688
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:48,676
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this show.

689
00:49:48,756 --> 00:49:49,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I really, really love this show.

690
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:50,697
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

691
00:49:50,917 --> 00:49:53,958
[SPEAKER_08]: My battle aura has... All your memes have been deleted.

692
00:49:53,978 --> 00:49:58,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a power level of over 4,000 now, Rob.

693
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,801
[SPEAKER_11]: I love you, Jamie.

694
00:50:00,441 --> 00:50:01,981
[SPEAKER_11]: The hell you do!

695
00:50:02,001 --> 00:50:03,082
[SPEAKER_11]: And JamieBot, and JamieBot.

696
00:50:03,122 --> 00:50:03,922
[SPEAKER_07]: The hell you do.

697
00:50:03,982 --> 00:50:05,023
[SPEAKER_07]: You treat me like this.

698
00:50:05,463 --> 00:50:06,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, here, look.

699
00:50:06,992 --> 00:50:11,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamie, I got a story that'll make you happy because I know you love Zork and Leisure Suit Larry.

700
00:50:11,957 --> 00:50:12,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Who doesn't love Leisure Suit Larry?

701
00:50:12,978 --> 00:50:13,819
[SPEAKER_11]: And King's Quest?

702
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I never really played any of them except for the first Zork.

703
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:18,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't you just play along?

704
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:20,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Vodka.

705
00:50:21,047 --> 00:50:21,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Vodka.

706
00:50:23,516 --> 00:50:24,496
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think Vodka was a game.

707
00:50:24,536 --> 00:50:26,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well how about the Indiana Jones?

708
00:50:26,617 --> 00:50:28,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Vodka cures PMS!

709
00:50:28,118 --> 00:50:28,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Maniac Mansion?

710
00:50:29,038 --> 00:50:30,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I love Maniac Mansion.

711
00:50:30,419 --> 00:50:30,879
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

712
00:50:30,899 --> 00:50:34,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Maniac Mansion, I'm sure there'll be a mention of it at AdventureCon.

713
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,260
[SPEAKER_11]: But news alert!

714
00:50:35,761 --> 00:50:44,904
[SPEAKER_11]: AdventureCon is an adventure game convention that's going to happen August 28th and 29th at the Mirage Hotel right on the Vegas Strip.

715
00:50:45,224 --> 00:50:48,185
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be two days of adventure game nerdom.

716
00:50:48,865 --> 00:50:50,506
[SPEAKER_11]: There's actually going to be a Zork room.

717
00:50:50,919 --> 00:51:19,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Because basically AdventureCon had started out as a 30th birthday celebration for Zork And so they decided to, it kind of grew into this all-encompassing adventure game thing Kind of like how Orange Lingerie started about music games, but now we're all video games because we did that So, there you go That's kind of neat And this, by the way, this is the first AdventureCon So it started off being a Zork thing, now it's this whole big thing because they're actually going to have Al Lowe from Sierra there

718
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:22,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Jane Jensen, the creator of the Gabriel Knights games.

719
00:51:23,017 --> 00:51:23,537
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty rad.

720
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,818
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not realize that Zork 1 was written in 1977.

721
00:51:26,598 --> 00:51:32,942
[SPEAKER_11]: The White House with a mailbox here seems so, so long ago.

722
00:51:34,602 --> 00:51:35,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Rob.

723
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:35,623
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

724
00:51:35,643 --> 00:51:37,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I just unleashed a grew in your underwear.

725
00:51:37,684 --> 00:51:38,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

726
00:51:39,645 --> 00:51:41,266
[SPEAKER_08]: It's squishy.

727
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:47,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, moving on for some different news.

728
00:51:49,028 --> 00:51:53,890
[SPEAKER_08]: The games for Windows Live Beta sign-up is now open.

729
00:51:54,850 --> 00:52:03,252
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Microsoft PC version of Xbox Live, and the two are going to be tied together for cross-platform play.

730
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:11,555
[SPEAKER_08]: So go check it out if you are not blessed enough to console game with the rest of us cool kids.

731
00:52:14,656 --> 00:52:14,816
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

732
00:52:16,772 --> 00:52:19,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I will not be checking this out because I do not have Vista.

733
00:52:20,393 --> 00:52:21,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not want Vista.

734
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Nor do I want to play PC.

735
00:52:23,134 --> 00:52:23,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not want!

736
00:52:25,615 --> 00:52:32,097
[SPEAKER_10]: But, what's kind of cool though, everyone remembers Wii Kade, that Flash... Wait, I have to say this real fast.

737
00:52:32,117 --> 00:52:33,637
[SPEAKER_11]: You know why I don't want Windows Vista?

738
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:40,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I do not want my computer to look like those god-awful Heroes previews that were brought to us by Windows Vista.

739
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:43,720
[SPEAKER_11]: That turned me off to Windows Vista.

740
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,141
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, what have you done to my Heroes?

741
00:52:45,781 --> 00:52:46,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not want!

742
00:52:48,897 --> 00:52:50,198
[SPEAKER_10]: and SimulatedVista.

743
00:52:50,259 --> 00:52:52,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Your offering has not pleased Kitty!

744
00:52:54,623 --> 00:52:55,303
[SPEAKER_10]: More!

745
00:52:56,845 --> 00:52:57,586
[SPEAKER_07]: No more!

746
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:00,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not want!

747
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:05,133
[SPEAKER_10]: So WeCade, a flashlight that has games made for the Wii browser.

748
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:16,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they've just opened up a downloadable API that will allow developers of other Flash games to use the Wii Remote's buttons for actual gameplay.

749
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:22,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Before, it used to be limited to kind of mouse games that use only the A button for clicking and stuff like that.

750
00:53:23,055 --> 00:53:28,619
[SPEAKER_10]: But now they've actually figured out how to use every single button on the Wii Remote, which is pretty fucking awesome.

751
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:31,862
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully we'll see some pretty cool games come from this.

752
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:36,664
[SPEAKER_10]: and hopefully I will actually work on OLRWee.com at some point.

753
00:53:36,724 --> 00:53:47,487
[SPEAKER_11]: You had to do that because there was some website I saw that had all these popular Wii game things listed or something and I did not see OLRWee.com and I remembered, oh yeah, there's nothing on it.

754
00:53:48,407 --> 00:53:49,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

755
00:53:50,187 --> 00:53:50,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Crackdown.

756
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,328
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a problem.

757
00:53:52,508 --> 00:53:57,629
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, going back to the last story, it was commented in our chat room, Loki does not have friends on Vista.

758
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's Black Wolf now, Loki?

759
00:54:01,192 --> 00:54:04,133
[SPEAKER_11]: BlackWolf even made that comment, so you got no friends now.

760
00:54:04,554 --> 00:54:05,434
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have Vista.

761
00:54:06,755 --> 00:54:07,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no.

762
00:54:07,395 --> 00:54:08,695
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a joke.

763
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:09,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's the thing, though.

764
00:54:10,476 --> 00:54:23,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Windows Live, you remember, is part of the Live Anywhere, so technically I have a lot more friends on Games for Windows Live than I do for actual the PS3 network.

765
00:54:23,442 --> 00:54:27,904
[SPEAKER_10]: So, ha, I do have friends on there, and I don't even have it.

766
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:34,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that you can't play with friends, although I think it would be fun if you could.

767
00:54:35,203 --> 00:54:36,563
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a SimCity DS.

768
00:54:36,723 --> 00:54:39,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I don't know much about this.

769
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:40,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps maybe you can play with friends.

770
00:54:40,984 --> 00:54:42,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there is wireless data exchange in this game.

771
00:54:42,884 --> 00:54:43,504
[SPEAKER_11]: I stand corrected.

772
00:54:43,524 --> 00:54:44,284
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can play with friends.

773
00:54:44,604 --> 00:54:45,585
[SPEAKER_11]: SimCity DS.

774
00:54:46,365 --> 00:54:50,585
[SPEAKER_11]: It has officially been announced that it will be coming to the U.S.

775
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:51,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

776
00:54:52,186 --> 00:54:54,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Other things that SimCity DS allows you to do.

777
00:54:54,346 --> 00:54:57,447
[SPEAKER_11]: You can blow out fires by blowing on the DS's microphone.

778
00:54:57,507 --> 00:54:59,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't that actually keep fires going?

779
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:00,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, forget it.

780
00:55:00,911 --> 00:55:03,613
[SPEAKER_11]: You sign off proclamations using the stylus.

781
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:04,814
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fun.

782
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:07,215
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you have it.

783
00:55:07,996 --> 00:55:09,757
[SPEAKER_11]: That will be coming out in June, by the way.

784
00:55:09,797 --> 00:55:14,700
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a nice little translation time between Japan and the U.S.

785
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:14,960
[SPEAKER_11]: there.

786
00:55:15,481 --> 00:55:18,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I believe this game just came out in Japan like last week.

787
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:24,467
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have to admit I'm not as excited about this game because it's based off the SimCity 2000 engine.

788
00:55:25,607 --> 00:55:27,388
[SPEAKER_11]: And I didn't like SimCity when it went 3D.

789
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:29,690
[SPEAKER_11]: It was too much for my feeble brain to handle.

790
00:55:31,397 --> 00:55:33,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Bring me my old school 2D, SimCity.

791
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:40,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually have it on virtual console and I never play it because yeah, I get sucked into other games like World of Warcraft.

792
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:44,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, that's just because you're an addict, Rob.

793
00:55:46,827 --> 00:55:48,288
[SPEAKER_08]: How about a different game?

794
00:55:48,408 --> 00:55:49,349
[SPEAKER_08]: How about Darwinia?

795
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:56,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Darwinia, as announced by Introversion, is going to be multiplayer in 2008.

796
00:55:56,534 --> 00:55:58,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

797
00:55:59,116 --> 00:55:59,436
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a

798
00:55:59,915 --> 00:56:03,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Set for release on its own, it's called Multiwinia.

799
00:56:04,618 --> 00:56:09,360
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll let you play cooperatively or competitively.

800
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:21,227
[SPEAKER_08]: The number of people on, they're not really sure how much they're going to be able to handle, but they're hoping that they're going to go really, really massive.

801
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:29,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to, you know, reserve judgment for actually seeing it, you know.

802
00:56:30,631 --> 00:56:42,079
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying that there's a quote by John Nottenbelt saying that it will let you organize your Darwinians into ranks and create massive armies.

803
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:43,560
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be kind of cool.

804
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:44,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

805
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still going to reserve judgment for actually seeing it.

806
00:56:47,622 --> 00:56:48,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a free game?

807
00:56:48,563 --> 00:56:49,183
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't remember.

808
00:56:49,283 --> 00:56:50,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Was Darwinia a free one?

809
00:56:50,604 --> 00:56:52,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it was.

810
00:56:53,526 --> 00:56:58,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody in chat I'm sure knows because I believe some folks ought to know what's going on there.

811
00:56:59,270 --> 00:56:59,570
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um,

812
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:03,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me see if anybody in chat can answer my question there.

813
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:05,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, they say no it wasn't.

814
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you could download a demo for free is what it was.

815
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:12,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Hitstun says Darwinia had a demo but the game was $20.

816
00:57:12,382 --> 00:57:15,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I was going to see if it was something I wanted to check out.

817
00:57:15,403 --> 00:57:17,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll check out the demo because I'm kind of curious.

818
00:57:18,564 --> 00:57:26,587
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, I'm very proud of Miklatov because he's been unlocking achievements in Crackdown for me while this show's been going on.

819
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:30,708
[SPEAKER_11]: So he got me this First Blood achievement which I didn't have and Bare Knuckle Brawler

820
00:57:31,294 --> 00:57:33,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Kill 150 gang members with your bare hands.

821
00:57:33,475 --> 00:57:33,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

822
00:57:35,415 --> 00:57:40,077
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you wondered how I was on Xbox Live during the show, it's actually Miklatov playing Crackdown right now.

823
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:41,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

824
00:57:42,617 --> 00:57:44,558
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have more achievements than you do at Crackdown.

825
00:57:45,638 --> 00:57:45,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Alrighty.

826
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:48,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you have a shitload of achievements in Crackdown.

827
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:48,819
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

828
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:50,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I have more achievements than you do in Universe.

829
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God, I can't believe I didn't mention this at the top of the show.

830
00:57:54,121 --> 00:57:54,581
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all right.

831
00:57:54,661 --> 00:57:55,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody gets to the end of the show.

832
00:57:56,022 --> 00:58:00,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know who I got a message from on Xbox Live while I was playing DDR Universe?

833
00:58:00,263 --> 00:58:00,403
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

834
00:58:00,951 --> 00:58:02,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Strip Club DJ.

835
00:58:02,652 --> 00:58:03,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know who that person is?

836
00:58:04,353 --> 00:58:10,476
[SPEAKER_11]: He is like the guy who was like, for a long time, he was the number one gamer points holder on all of Xbox Live, right?

837
00:58:11,236 --> 00:58:12,857
[SPEAKER_11]: He has over 100,000 gamer score.

838
00:58:13,137 --> 00:58:18,259
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a message from him, and it said simply, can you use the joystick on DDR?

839
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:23,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think he's probably contemplating, do I want to get DDR to get the 1,000 achievement points out of?

840
00:58:23,772 --> 00:58:24,432
[SPEAKER_11]: So I replied.

841
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:26,114
[SPEAKER_11]: I replied with a voice message, though.

842
00:58:26,894 --> 00:58:34,439
[SPEAKER_11]: But I said something like, yes, you can, but obviously you're supposed to use the dance pad, but if you're just trying to run through the game, you'll probably just want to use the controller.

843
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:39,302
[SPEAKER_11]: But I said something about quest mode sucking and a lot of the unlocks coming through that.

844
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:46,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, see, I was stupid, and I told somebody there was like 75 unlocks, because in quest mode it says 0 of 75 for music stuff.

845
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:50,369
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how much you own, or how many songs you own in quest mode, right?

846
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:51,370
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it is.

847
00:58:51,923 --> 00:58:58,285
[SPEAKER_11]: When you buy a song in quest mode to have the advantage in quest mode, that's... See, the game doesn't fucking explain any of this.

848
00:58:58,305 --> 00:58:58,965
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why quest mode sucks.

849
00:58:58,985 --> 00:59:00,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even know what the hell that meant.

850
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:01,226
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it means.

851
00:59:02,866 --> 00:59:03,406
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there you go.

852
00:59:07,007 --> 00:59:19,931
[SPEAKER_11]: But that was kind of funny to get a message from him, because I guess, apparently, at one point, and I looked at my gamercard.net right after that, because that's the one that ranks... I was apparently, like, number six or seven in the world for gamer score earned in DDR Universe.

853
00:59:20,091 --> 00:59:20,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

854
00:59:20,771 --> 00:59:21,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

855
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:23,411
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen

856
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,080
[SPEAKER_11]: But nobody has all 1,000 yet.

857
00:59:54,181 --> 00:59:55,761
[SPEAKER_11]: I only have 480 points in the game.

858
00:59:55,781 --> 00:59:56,721
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that hard.

859
00:59:56,861 --> 01:00:03,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I could probably, if I really just sat down and played it, I could probably crank out the whole game in one day.

860
01:00:03,663 --> 01:00:12,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, not that I'm not, you know, I may think achievement points are fun and all, and, you know, they kind of add something to the game, but I would not consider myself an achievement point whore, so to speak.

861
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:18,787
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was kind of just interesting that I was, I did show up on there and got contacted by Strip Club DJ.

862
01:00:18,807 --> 01:00:19,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

863
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,301
[SPEAKER_11]: True Achievement Points Horror because of it.

864
01:00:21,462 --> 01:00:22,582
[SPEAKER_11]: So, interesting.

865
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:25,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, we're going to open up the Skype line.

866
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:28,967
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to give us a call and interact with our program, you can do so.

867

871
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:49,454
[SPEAKER_11]: While we wait for someone to come in, does anybody have a last minute story?

872
01:00:50,174 --> 01:00:50,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

873
01:00:50,694 --> 01:00:51,335
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want, Jamie?

874
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Loki had one first, right?

875
01:00:54,176 --> 01:00:54,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Just real quick.

876
01:00:54,797 --> 01:00:56,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Just one story for now and then we'll get to some other calls.

877
01:00:56,898 --> 01:00:57,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Just real quick.

878
01:00:57,878 --> 01:01:06,182
[SPEAKER_10]: In God of War 2, someone had gotten the game out before it's come out and on the back of the manual there it says God of War PSP coming 2007.

879
01:01:06,623 --> 01:01:09,224
[SPEAKER_10]: So, confirm it is coming on the PSP.

880
01:01:09,244 --> 01:01:11,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, there you have it.

881
01:01:11,265 --> 01:01:12,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we can go to the phones.

882
01:01:12,786 --> 01:01:12,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

883
01:01:13,752 --> 01:01:17,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Legend of Zaku You already know about that gold is going to be released tomorrow for the location test, right?

884
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:19,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we mentioned that on last week's show.

885
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:19,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

886
01:01:39,682 --> 01:01:50,065
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, they're all saying that, you know, from what I'm hearing right now, is that, you know, it has to do really good in order for it to actually move any further.

887
01:01:50,825 --> 01:01:53,025
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a one-shot deal at the moment right now.

888
01:01:53,725 --> 01:01:54,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, but wait a minute, though.

889
01:01:54,966 --> 01:02:03,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, what about those arcades that import Japanese games anyway, like Arcade Infinity and whatever that one is on the East Coast that was...

890
01:02:09,156 --> 01:02:12,879
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the one that might tip the scale.

891
01:02:13,259 --> 01:02:14,940
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what city is it in again?

892
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,041
[SPEAKER_11]: It's somewhere in Illinois, right?

893
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Naperville.

894
01:02:17,662 --> 01:02:18,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Naperville?

[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

896
01:02:19,243 --> 01:02:19,704
[SPEAKER_01]: In Illinois?

897
01:02:19,724 --> 01:02:24,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's near Benson's location, nearby Chicago.

898
01:02:24,347 --> 01:02:33,053
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, if you are in the Chicago, Naperville area, and you are a music video game fan, and you want to see Beatmania make a U.S.

899
01:02:33,073 --> 01:02:34,795
[SPEAKER_11]: debut in arcades, you've got to go.

900
01:02:34,815 --> 01:02:35,415
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to help out.

901
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:38,404
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see it out, go through.

902
01:02:38,424 --> 01:02:39,204
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm through on it.

903
01:02:39,685 --> 01:02:39,965
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

904
01:02:40,285 --> 01:02:42,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you for the reminder, Mr. Zaku.

905
01:02:42,407 --> 01:02:43,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I unfortunately cannot attend.

906
01:02:43,628 --> 01:02:44,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Chicago's a little far.

907
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:45,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Several thousand miles.

908
01:02:46,891 --> 01:02:49,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's probably no one who's hearing this right now.

909
01:02:49,973 --> 01:02:50,454
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very true.

910
01:02:50,874 --> 01:02:53,496
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have the luxury of being not too far from L.A.

911
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:57,760
[SPEAKER_11]: where we can drive for six hours to play 2DX Gold whenever they get it.

912
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,661
[SPEAKER_11]: If they don't already have it, I don't even know.

913
01:02:59,902 --> 01:03:01,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't actually followed B-Mania in a while, sadly.

914
01:03:02,684 --> 01:03:02,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

915
01:03:03,124 --> 01:03:03,385
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

916
01:03:03,925 --> 01:03:04,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anything else, Zaku?

917
01:03:06,008 --> 01:03:18,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just Sony's rumbling about why they just, why they didn't bother to settle quickly with immersion rather than just wait till they drop the PS3.

918
01:03:18,255 --> 01:03:18,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Pride.

919
01:03:20,217 --> 01:03:25,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Pride is more like they were banking on some, you know, on a sinking ship called their lawsuit.

920
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, remember that Rumble is so last gen.

921
01:03:29,422 --> 01:03:32,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's, they're spinning it in, they're in denial.

922
01:03:33,336 --> 01:03:40,298
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a little kid, they know they fucked up, and so they're just like, they don't want to admit it.

923
01:03:40,538 --> 01:03:42,098
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to admit they fucked up badly.

924
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:46,940
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, you know, PS3 is not even worth getting right now, not even for another year.

925
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:47,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

926
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:54,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Zaku, thank you very much for the call, and good luck with your 2DX Gold promotion.

927
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:56,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, thank you.

928
01:03:57,483 --> 01:03:59,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's go to another phone call.

929
01:03:59,804 --> 01:04:01,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

930
01:04:02,537 --> 01:04:03,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up, guys?

931
01:04:03,157 --> 01:04:06,419
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Rob D. Hi, Rob D. Are you still bitter about your loss from last week?

932
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:08,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, not so much.

933
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,720
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I'm just giving you a hard time.

934
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:10,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki did a good job on that.

935
01:04:10,621 --> 01:04:11,921
[SPEAKER_11]: You were a very good sport about the whole thing.

936
01:04:11,941 --> 01:04:12,582
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind, buddy?

937
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:13,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too much.

938
01:04:13,922 --> 01:04:19,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wondering what you guys thought about the news about the 20 gigabyte PS3 being possibly discontinued.

939
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:20,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you heard about that.

940
01:04:21,595 --> 01:04:25,218
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually did cover it in part A. I don't know if Bobby's show ran long tonight or what.

941
01:04:25,939 --> 01:04:26,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I suck then.

942
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:26,979
[SPEAKER_11]: It's okay.

943
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually been busy recording some stuff, but that's a different story altogether.

944
01:04:30,542 --> 01:04:31,543
[SPEAKER_11]: That's alright, we'll forgive you.

945
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:42,452
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't... The 20 gig model, I mean, it was not something I was interested in anyway, so I'm a little bit, you know, kind of about the whole thing anyway.

946
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:48,256
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, to be honest, the 20 gig model is just as good as the 60 gig as far as what's available for it.

947
01:04:48,316 --> 01:04:49,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if I were the

948
01:04:49,964 --> 01:04:50,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy one.

949
01:04:50,764 --> 01:04:52,505
[SPEAKER_10]: I would pick the 20 gig.

950
01:04:52,705 --> 01:04:54,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a 20 gig, and it's great.

951
01:04:55,105 --> 01:04:59,246
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's not like I have to worry about filling up with downloads because there's nothing to download on it.

952
01:05:00,507 --> 01:05:03,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, isn't the 60 gigabyte version supposed to have dual HDMI ports?

953
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:04,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait.

954
01:05:04,428 --> 01:05:04,988
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it doesn't.

955
01:05:05,088 --> 01:05:06,448
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

956
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,048
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they said on E3.

957
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:11,409
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah.

958
01:05:11,809 --> 01:05:15,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about.

959
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:16,010
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

960
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:18,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you very much for the call, Rob D. We appreciate it.

961
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:20,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for taking my call.

962
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:21,550
[SPEAKER_04]: See you guys later.

963
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:22,091
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem.

964
01:05:22,131 --> 01:05:22,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good week.

965
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:23,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

966
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:23,711
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

967
01:05:23,751 --> 01:05:23,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

968
01:05:24,651 --> 01:05:24,891
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

969
01:05:24,951 --> 01:05:32,753
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to give a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you got to call.

970
01:05:32,773 --> 01:05:33,713
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

971
01:05:34,193 --> 01:05:37,334
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, why don't you throw us your last minute story while we're waiting for a call?

972
01:05:37,454 --> 01:05:43,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it was actually something posted by TigerClaw in the chat room during the break.

973
01:05:43,895 --> 01:05:48,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Activision released a screenshot from the new Transformers game that they're putting out.

974
01:05:49,339 --> 01:05:53,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, it makes my heart break.

975
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not gonna like the movie, I don't think.

976
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,441
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't look like Transformers.

977
01:05:57,341 --> 01:06:01,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And the game makes my heart hurt.

978
01:06:02,722 --> 01:06:03,663
[SPEAKER_11]: What's so bad about it?

979
01:06:04,403 --> 01:06:05,783
[SPEAKER_08]: What isn't so bad about it?

980
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:07,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, did you see it?

981
01:06:08,324 --> 01:06:08,384
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

982
01:06:08,404 --> 01:06:09,104
[SPEAKER_08]: What did it look like?

983
01:06:09,864 --> 01:06:11,544
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fucking awesome is what it is.

984
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:12,765
[SPEAKER_08]: The fuck it is?

985
01:06:12,985 --> 01:06:14,345
[SPEAKER_08]: That does not look like Bumblebee.

986
01:06:14,365 --> 01:06:18,026
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like a bee's head and, like, junk.

987
01:06:19,454 --> 01:06:20,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait to see this movie.

988
01:06:20,395 --> 01:06:21,236
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be awesome.

989
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:21,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

990
01:06:21,816 --> 01:06:22,397
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome.

991
01:06:23,057 --> 01:06:25,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'll go see it because I have to, but God!

992
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:26,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking ugly.

993
01:06:30,244 --> 01:06:30,545
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

994
01:06:30,705 --> 01:06:34,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let's go to another call here on the Skype line and see what you folks have to say.

995
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:36,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

996
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:36,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

997
01:06:37,371 --> 01:06:37,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa.

998
01:06:37,972 --> 01:06:38,592
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys can hear me?

999
01:06:39,053 --> 01:06:40,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, yes, we can hear you.

1000
01:06:40,094 --> 01:06:40,394
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up?

1001
01:06:41,075 --> 01:06:42,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, this is DDR Dollar Bill.

1002
01:06:43,217 --> 01:06:44,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.

1003
01:06:44,157 --> 01:06:44,658
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

1004
01:06:45,698 --> 01:06:46,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, not that much.

1005
01:06:47,018 --> 01:06:48,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a Wii for Valentine's Day.

1006
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:51,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Wii-ly!

1007
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Wii-ly!

1008
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice little present, too, I figured.

1009
01:06:57,202 --> 01:06:57,802
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you think?

1010
01:06:59,022 --> 01:07:01,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, me and a girlfriend love it a lot.

1011
01:07:01,923 --> 01:07:08,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We play mostly Wii Sports, Wii Play, and we're also getting into Metal Slug Anthology.

1012
01:07:11,846 --> 01:07:15,007
[SPEAKER_05]: My big thing was that, did somebody in the show...

1013
01:07:15,997 --> 01:07:18,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I said the Metal Slug Anthology stunk.

1014
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:19,300
[SPEAKER_11]: The what?

1015
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:20,220
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1016
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,962
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awesome.

1017
01:07:23,062 --> 01:07:24,824
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't played Metal Gear Anthology.

1018
01:07:24,944 --> 01:07:27,826
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, I'm sorry, Metal Slug Anthology.

1019
01:07:28,146 --> 01:07:31,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what we said on the show is that Kropotkin and Hendrix reviewed it this week.

1020
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:36,672
[SPEAKER_11]: We were teasing the all games thing because they play Kropotkin and Hendrix between our show.

1021
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,735
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know if they said it sucked.

1022
01:07:39,815 --> 01:07:41,916
[SPEAKER_11]: I unfortunately did not get a chance to hear their show yet this week.

1023
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:43,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they did though.

1024
01:07:43,557 --> 01:07:44,218
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they liked it.

1025
01:07:45,123 --> 01:07:55,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's pretty much better than the other emulations that came out for the other systems because in most of the emulated versions, like the Xbox for example, there were loading times in between each level.

1026
01:07:56,248 --> 01:07:57,269
[SPEAKER_05]: This one has none.

1027
01:07:57,649 --> 01:08:00,310
[SPEAKER_05]: It just pretty much comes into the game and plays it straight through.

1028
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's exactly like the arcade.

1029
01:08:05,292 --> 01:08:06,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

1030
01:08:08,474 --> 01:08:09,794
[SPEAKER_11]: What else on the Wii have you been playing?

1031
01:08:09,834 --> 01:08:11,235
[SPEAKER_11]: So obviously Metal Slug Anthology.

1032
01:08:12,095 --> 01:08:13,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried the Wii Sports and the Wii Play.

1033
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:18,099
[SPEAKER_05]: We play, it's alright.

1034
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,461
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just waiting for the other controller, you know.

1035
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:21,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

1036
01:08:22,382 --> 01:08:24,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but the Wii Sports is a blast.

1037
01:08:26,344 --> 01:08:29,886
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think the Wii's chances are against the 360 and the PlayStation 3?

1038
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, you live, where was it that you live again?

1039
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:36,049
[SPEAKER_05]: New York, right nearby where Ranma lives.

1040
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:37,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

1041
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:39,571
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think, I thought for some reason you were in another country.

1042
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:44,334
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think the chances are of the Wii doing against the 360 and the PS3 in the long run?

1043
01:08:46,797 --> 01:08:58,646
[SPEAKER_05]: If they can get better games that just don't rely on the Wii controls, but rather make something like the original stuff and a good third-party support, yeah, it's definitely going to be a lamp for a while.

1044
01:08:58,666 --> 01:08:59,787
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1045
01:09:00,388 --> 01:09:02,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And not just thought of as a party system, you know?

1046
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:03,370
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1047
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:04,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners, my friend?

1048
01:09:05,632 --> 01:09:06,192
[SPEAKER_05]: One question.

1049
01:09:06,532 --> 01:09:06,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1050
01:09:07,373 --> 01:09:11,276
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the exact difference with Zelda on the GameCube and the Wii?

1051
01:09:13,245 --> 01:09:17,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything is right-handed on the Wii and left-handed on the GameCube.

1052
01:09:18,707 --> 01:09:21,608
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have the same graphics and music and all that?

1053
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:22,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, no.

1054
01:09:22,928 --> 01:09:24,569
[SPEAKER_11]: The GameCube does not support the 16x9.

1055
01:09:24,609 --> 01:09:30,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything will be in the square as well, and that's why the graphics suffer a little bit.

1056
01:09:32,051 --> 01:09:32,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1057
01:09:32,891 --> 01:09:33,871
[SPEAKER_11]: So there you go.

1058
01:09:33,891 --> 01:09:34,932
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1059
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:35,712
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1060
01:09:35,732 --> 01:09:37,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you so much for the call, buddy, and enjoy the Wii.

1061
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:38,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

1062
01:09:38,933 --> 01:09:39,373
[SPEAKER_05]: See you guys.

1063
01:09:39,473 --> 01:09:39,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

1064
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:39,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

1065
01:09:40,623 --> 01:09:42,825
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we'll try at least one more call here on the Skype line.

1066
01:09:43,265 --> 01:09:44,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1067
01:09:44,366 --> 01:09:44,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

1068
01:09:47,007 --> 01:09:47,948
[SPEAKER_11]: It's deep breathing.

1069
01:09:48,648 --> 01:09:49,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, it's me.

1070
01:09:49,509 --> 01:09:50,690
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Uni.

1071
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:52,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was an erotic phone call.

1072
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:52,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's this?

1073
01:09:53,532 --> 01:09:54,252
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Uni.

1074
01:09:54,412 --> 01:09:54,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Uni.

1075
01:09:54,912 --> 01:09:56,534
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1076
01:09:56,914 --> 01:09:58,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering about something.

1077
01:09:59,075 --> 01:10:03,038
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was thinking about getting a PS3, but you know how crappy they are?

1078
01:10:04,098 --> 01:10:05,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

1079
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:07,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what might be swaying your mind on this?

1080
01:10:08,388 --> 01:10:14,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I do play a lot of PS2 games on my PS2 and everything.

1081
01:10:14,992 --> 01:10:21,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, I don't know why I would want to buy one other than it enhances the graphics on your PS2 games.

1082
01:10:23,077 --> 01:10:27,519
[SPEAKER_11]: And even for a while it was de-hancing them, if you might remember that thing a while back.

1083
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:32,082
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, why should you buy one?

1084
01:10:32,102 --> 01:10:33,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they're like a 300 or 400, maybe 500 piece of crap, really.

1085
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:44,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just thinking about what I should buy because I'm not really sure yet.

1086
01:10:46,685 --> 01:10:48,586
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think the PlayStation 3 is worth it at the time.

1087
01:10:48,646 --> 01:10:53,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, you've got to remember the golden rule of gaming here at Orange Lingerie.

1088
01:10:53,768 --> 01:10:56,789
[SPEAKER_11]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1089
01:10:57,549 --> 01:11:00,090
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's really about what type of games you want to play.

1090
01:11:00,652 --> 01:11:06,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if first-person shooters are your thing, oh my god, Xbox 360 all the way.

1091
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:14,379
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want something that's a little more light-hearted, fun type of games, the Wii is very your active system type of game.

1092
01:11:14,899 --> 01:11:17,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, you've got the PlayStation 3, which doesn't have a lot right now.

1093
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:22,783
[SPEAKER_11]: It's thought that a little later on down the line, its strengths will be role-playing games and so on, just like it was on PlayStation 2.

1094
01:11:23,223 --> 01:11:25,204
[SPEAKER_11]: But right now, not a lot going for it.

1095
01:11:25,805 --> 01:11:29,647
[SPEAKER_11]: And you've got Microsoft trying to step it up with what they were lacking with the Xbox the first time around.

1096
01:11:30,067 --> 01:11:30,227
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1097
01:11:30,765 --> 01:11:36,850
[SPEAKER_06]: They're talking about bringing out another MMO from Square Enix called Final Fantasy XIII.

1098
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:38,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really sure about it.

1099
01:11:39,272 --> 01:11:47,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it might bring me back to Square Enix, but they're really sitting on their thumbs most of the time when you're calling a GM on Final Fantasy XI.

1100
01:11:48,599 --> 01:11:53,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing WoW, and when you call a GM, it's like that.

1101
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:54,624
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you

1102
01:11:55,046 --> 01:11:55,947
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1103
01:12:14,406 --> 01:12:16,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy XIII Versus is not going to be online.

1104
01:12:16,968 --> 01:12:19,030
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's going to be more of a Kingdom Hearts-ish game.

1105
01:12:19,311 --> 01:12:20,492
[SPEAKER_11]: But that sounds pretty hot to me.

1106
01:12:22,393 --> 01:12:25,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy XIII probably will be the game that gets me on PlayStation.

1107
01:12:26,517 --> 01:12:30,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I also heard that Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories is coming to the PS2.

1108
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:34,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw the trailer for it.

1109
01:12:34,473 --> 01:12:36,254
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a big trailer for it on YouTube.

1110
01:12:37,174 --> 01:12:41,615
[SPEAKER_08]: It's completely redone, full style for the Kingdom Hearts games.

1111
01:12:41,755 --> 01:12:44,495
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really, really awesome looking.

1112
01:12:46,135 --> 01:12:49,756
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can remember where to find it, I should see if I can't repost the YouTube link.

1113
01:12:49,956 --> 01:12:51,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very curious to check this out myself.

1114
01:12:52,077 --> 01:12:53,937
[SPEAKER_08]: It is freaking awesome.

1115
01:12:54,477 --> 01:12:55,277
[SPEAKER_11]: You should check it out.

1116
01:12:55,297 --> 01:12:55,857
[SPEAKER_11]: It better be.

1117
01:12:56,297 --> 01:12:59,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if I'm rebuying Kingdom Hearts 2 for it, it better be.

1118
01:13:00,054 --> 01:13:04,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well, Yuni, thanks so much for the call, and take care, and good luck on your system hunting.

1119
01:13:04,697 --> 01:13:05,438
[SPEAKER_06]: You too, thank you.

1120
01:13:05,718 --> 01:13:06,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

1121
01:13:07,339 --> 01:13:09,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's see if we get any more calls.

1122
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:10,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Ring, ring, ring.

1123
01:13:11,081 --> 01:13:12,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, that must be on the back line.

1124
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:14,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, who's this?

1125
01:13:14,183 --> 01:13:14,844
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Shane.

1126
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:17,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, hey, Shane's standing right in front of me.

1127
01:13:17,145 --> 01:13:17,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Shane.

1128
01:13:18,006 --> 01:13:18,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

1129
01:13:18,486 --> 01:13:18,806
[SPEAKER_11]: A.K.A.

1130
01:13:19,386 --> 01:13:20,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Miklatov.

1131
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:21,528
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't call you Miklatov anymore.

1132
01:13:21,548 --> 01:13:27,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I had to change it because I'm trying to get into a pump group, and there was already a Miklatov in pumps, so I have to go buy my

1133
01:13:28,263 --> 01:13:29,944
[SPEAKER_09]: More recent nickname of Arx.

1134
01:13:30,024 --> 01:13:31,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, whatever the hell your name is.

1135
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:32,085
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I just go by Shane.

1136
01:13:32,145 --> 01:13:32,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, then what do you want?

1137
01:13:33,326 --> 01:13:35,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Crackdown's the best game ever.

1138
01:13:35,107 --> 01:13:35,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

1139
01:13:35,527 --> 01:13:36,507
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's on my mind.

1140
01:13:36,527 --> 01:13:38,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I saw you unlock some achievements for me.

1141
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:38,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate that.

1142
01:13:38,828 --> 01:13:39,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Heck yeah, it's so much fun.

1143
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,370
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't really getting into it.

1144
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:44,992
[SPEAKER_11]: What really do you love about this game?

1145
01:13:45,232 --> 01:13:49,774
[SPEAKER_09]: You can jump really high, and you jump across rooftops, and you're like the tick, that superhero.

1146
01:13:50,795 --> 01:13:52,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it just because I hadn't leveled up enough that I couldn't do it?

1147
01:13:53,636 --> 01:13:57,058
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I think you just didn't understand what you were doing, and...

1148
01:13:57,737 --> 01:13:58,457
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right, I didn't.

1149
01:13:58,957 --> 01:14:02,759
[SPEAKER_09]: You're supposed to go and shoot people and kick them and jump from roof to roof.

1150
01:14:03,019 --> 01:14:04,079
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's so much fun.

1151
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:05,160
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really want it.

1152
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:05,920
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1153
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you can't have my copy because now that you've told me it's fun, I need to go back and play it more.

1154
01:14:09,881 --> 01:14:10,982
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a terrible game.

1155
01:14:11,782 --> 01:14:12,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Lies.

1156
01:14:12,462 --> 01:14:12,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1157
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:13,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Lies.

1158
01:14:13,742 --> 01:14:14,923
[SPEAKER_11]: You played Myst Online a little bit.

1159
01:14:14,943 --> 01:14:15,563
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you think of that?

1160
01:14:16,503 --> 01:14:21,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I would like it a whole lot if it didn't have the worst controls I've ever touched.

1161
01:14:22,265 --> 01:14:23,566
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really terrible.

1162
01:14:23,586 --> 01:14:24,006
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's simple.

1163
01:14:24,813 --> 01:14:45,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Simply Hard, maybe if it had like a gamepad input thing I could use, but I can't use WASD and it's just, it goes back to that old Resident Evil style where up is always forward no matter which way you're facing and I don't dig that and the mouse is awkward to use.

1164
01:14:46,508 --> 01:14:51,632
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think I will probably give it another shot because it was really cool because I like solving puzzle things.

1165
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:52,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1166
01:14:53,127 --> 01:14:54,609
[SPEAKER_09]: And Crackdown's a great game.

1167
01:14:55,911 --> 01:14:56,912
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so much fun.

1168
01:14:57,613 --> 01:15:01,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say something more, but it's probably like racist.

1169
01:15:01,499 --> 01:15:02,540
[SPEAKER_09]: It is so funny.

1170
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I say it anyway?

1171
01:15:03,662 --> 01:15:04,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

1172
01:15:04,503 --> 01:15:07,207
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so much fun kicking the Mexicans in the head.

1173
01:15:12,927 --> 01:15:15,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio has just been banned from Mexico.

1174
01:15:15,228 --> 01:15:15,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at that.

1175
01:15:15,908 --> 01:15:16,548
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you like that?

1176
01:15:16,848 --> 01:15:18,469
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only part I'm at right now.

1177
01:15:18,509 --> 01:15:23,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure once I beat that part, I can go kick some other race, but Mexicans are so easy targets.

1178
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:23,990
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, there you go.

1179
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:25,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Click.

1180
01:15:26,071 --> 01:15:28,191
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Dollar Bill says, Holy racist remark.

1181
01:15:29,512 --> 01:15:30,052
[SPEAKER_09]: My God.

1182
01:15:30,212 --> 01:15:31,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft is a Mexican.

1183
01:15:31,892 --> 01:15:32,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't like that comment.

1184
01:15:33,513 --> 01:15:34,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Did not like that comment.

1185
01:15:35,293 --> 01:15:39,274
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay, because I'm like a quarter Brazilian, and that's all I know.

1186
01:15:39,815 --> 01:15:40,855
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm dirty, too.

1187
01:15:44,755 --> 01:15:44,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft.com

1188
01:16:14,474 --> 01:16:17,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Agent Otto, I don't recognize your name.

1189
01:16:17,935 --> 01:16:18,836
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want, Agent Otto?

1190
01:16:20,196 --> 01:16:21,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you a new listener of Orange On Radio?

1191
01:16:22,237 --> 01:16:23,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Elevator Action.

1192
01:16:24,078 --> 01:16:24,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh!

1193
01:16:24,798 --> 01:16:25,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God!

1194
01:16:25,798 --> 01:16:29,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yes, Elevator Action, that horribly overrated game from the 1980s.

1195
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,020
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you, Agent Otto?

1196
01:16:31,658 --> 01:16:32,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing great.

1197
01:16:32,318 --> 01:16:35,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what your problem is with my game and what I do for a living.

1198
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:40,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I go into buildings, find documents, and not get shot in the head and not get crushed by elevators.

1199
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:41,641
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?

1200
01:16:41,721 --> 01:16:44,101
[SPEAKER_02]: You sit there and talk about how bad my game is?

1201
01:16:44,481 --> 01:16:50,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Agent Otto, your game bored the shit out of me because it was pretty much the same joke after the first two minutes for, you know, hours on end.

1202
01:16:51,823 --> 01:16:53,724
[SPEAKER_11]: You know the game's actually hard, right?

1203
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:56,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is pretty hard.

1204
01:16:56,604 --> 01:16:57,885
[SPEAKER_11]: That's another reason why I don't play it.

1205
01:16:59,225 --> 01:16:59,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1206
01:16:59,784 --> 01:17:04,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then you probably didn't play anything from the 80s then, because you clearly hate hard games.

1207
01:17:04,347 --> 01:17:06,908
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I actually played a lot of games from the 80s, like Crystal Castles.

1208
01:17:06,968 --> 01:17:12,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I don't know if you listened to the program last week, but we had a whole segment on 80s games that I played in Beat the Host.

1209
01:17:13,952 --> 01:17:15,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't listen to your show.

1210
01:17:15,914 --> 01:17:19,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too busy going through... How did you get the number to this program then, Agent Otto?

1211
01:17:20,116 --> 01:17:24,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm at DMN's house drinking beer, and I heard you talking shit about me.

1212
01:17:25,019 --> 01:17:26,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you hanging out with DMN?

1213
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:26,760
[SPEAKER_02]: He sucks.

1214
01:17:27,642 --> 01:17:29,503
[SPEAKER_02]: because I have no one better to hang out with

1215
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:03,711
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can hear DMN here on Orange Lounge Radio on Thursday nights on STFU.

1216
01:18:03,731 --> 01:18:05,152
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to hear that.

1217
01:18:05,352 --> 01:18:06,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Uni says DMN is not funny.

1218
01:18:07,012 --> 01:18:08,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Aw, poor DMN.

1219
01:18:08,632 --> 01:18:09,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Poor baby.

1220
01:18:10,773 --> 01:18:11,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1221
01:18:12,253 --> 01:18:16,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry to those folks we didn't get to, but we gotta get the show wrapped up because it's already like 20 minutes after 9.

1222
01:18:16,994 --> 01:18:18,155
[SPEAKER_11]: We're running a little long tonight.

1223
01:18:18,515 --> 01:18:19,895
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like to go home at a decent hour tonight.

1224
01:18:20,275 --> 01:18:23,556
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there's any more last minute stories, now's a good time to get them out.

1225
01:18:24,396 --> 01:18:24,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

1226
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:25,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki?

1227
01:18:26,837 --> 01:18:26,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope.

1228
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:28,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around and get everybody's

1229
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:29,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Final thought.

1230
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:30,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, your final thought.

1231
01:18:32,771 --> 01:18:33,831
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to finish Crackdown.

1232
01:18:34,632 --> 01:18:35,752
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1233
01:18:36,352 --> 01:18:39,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to play more Captain America.

1234
01:18:40,973 --> 01:18:42,914
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is Pants.

1235
01:18:45,535 --> 01:18:50,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for tuning in to and supporting independent podcasting and independent gaming radio.

1236
01:18:50,516 --> 01:18:54,297
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to show your appreciation for Orange Lounge Radio and us doing this crap for free...

1237
01:18:55,073 --> 01:19:02,478
[SPEAKER_11]: You can tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio because if everybody tells two people about Orange Lounge Radio, within weeks we will have taken over the world.

1238
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:03,738
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much.

1239
01:19:04,259 --> 01:19:13,584
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you have no friends to tell about Orange Lounge Radio, you can always leave us a nice review on iTunes or Dig or Podcast Alley or one of those sites.

1240
01:19:14,005 --> 01:19:14,965
[SPEAKER_11]: That will work as well.

1241
01:19:15,646 --> 01:19:15,926
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1242
01:19:16,746 --> 01:19:18,007
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's going to do it for the show.

1243
01:19:18,427 --> 01:19:20,969
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see you here next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1244
01:19:24,514 --> 01:19:26,936
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1245
01:19:27,256 --> 01:19:30,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1246
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:40,007
