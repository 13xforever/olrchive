[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:19,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on March 25th, 2007.

4
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:25,667
[SPEAKER_07]: We tape Orange Lounge Radio in two parts.

5
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:31,653
[SPEAKER_07]: If this is your very first time downloading Orange Lounge Radio to listen to us, please check our RSS feed for past shows.

6
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:36,097
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can hear part A of this episode where we talked about the launch of the PlayStation 3.

7
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:37,859
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about the black Xbox 360.

8
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:39,476
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on and so on.

9
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:41,697
[SPEAKER_07]: When I say launch of the PlayStation 3, I mean in Europe, of course.

10
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:42,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Not here.

11
00:00:42,497 --> 00:00:46,298
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be old news, and we try to avoid old news, if possible, on this program.

12
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:58,201
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura is not here tonight, and I was out of town for the past four days, so Loki's taking over the news tonight, and I am simply commenting here with Rice Princess, who's filled in tonight and is making the occasional comment while playing on the laptop.

13
00:00:59,441 --> 00:00:59,701
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

14
00:01:00,402 --> 00:01:01,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, take it away.

15
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:05,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well this week we had some more news that wasn't really favorable for Sony.

16
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:10,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was more exclusives leaving Sony and going to the Xbox 360.

17
00:01:10,832 --> 00:01:14,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily being exclusive for the 360, but for now for both systems.

18
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:22,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So, for example, the first title, and actually a big one, Devil May Cry 4, has been confirmed to be on the Xbox 360 and the PSP...

19
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:52,823
[SPEAKER_05]: and that is confirmed according to Capcom Japan so um that sucks and according to Xbox product manager of Microsoft Germany Boris Schneider Schneider John I guess hyphen in the name Devil May Cry is only the first there will be three exclusives total that are coming to the Xbox 360 and um

20
00:01:55,646 --> 00:02:01,907
[SPEAKER_05]: According to that, I believe it was Final Fantasy XIII and Metal Gear Solid 4, the other two.

21
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:04,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Boy, that would be a 1, 2, 3 knockout.

22
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:18,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, honestly, Final Fantasy XIII for me is kind of one of the few things that Sony seems to be hanging on with right now because Xbox 360 kind of lacks really solid role-playing, next-gen role-playing games right now.

23
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, sure, you've got Enchanted Arm, but that is...

24
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:27,973
[SPEAKER_07]: While it wasn't a bad game, it wasn't a OMG, memorable, wonderful, forever title.

25
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:32,278
[SPEAKER_07]: And although Final Fantasy XIII may indeed suck, it is a Final Fantasy game.

26
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:33,439
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be people lined up for it.

27
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:37,943
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, though, this was in his blog post, because I guess that's the way he keeps blogs nowadays.

28
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:40,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, chat room says Blue Dragon.

29
00:02:41,086 --> 00:02:42,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, true, true, you got me there.

30
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:45,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, though, these are just...

31
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:48,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of a personal shopping list.

32
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily anything confirmed.

33
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,650
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a rumor for now.

34
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:56,832
[SPEAKER_05]: But Devil May Cry 4 is definitely... That's going to hurt.

35
00:02:57,452 --> 00:03:04,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, though, you kind of have to be stupid unless there's a lot of money on the table to release something just on PlayStation 3.

36
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:07,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, especially if you're looking to sell lots of copies of it.

37
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:09,655
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just not that many units out there.

38
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:12,456
[SPEAKER_05]: For now, but we don't know what Sony might have in the pipeline.

39
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:13,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's companies that are doing that.

40
00:03:13,556 --> 00:03:14,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, look at...

41
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:17,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Ubisoft, for example.

42
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:22,567
[SPEAKER_05]: How long has Rainbow Six Vegas for the PlayStation 3 been delayed?

43
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:24,409
[SPEAKER_05]: A long time.

44
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:34,455
[SPEAKER_05]: It originally was supposed to be coming out at launch, and then it was delayed to January, then February, then March, now I think April and possibly May.

45
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:35,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

46
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:43,444
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, yeah, they're really pushing along until there's enough units out there, and it will keep moving until Christmas if it has to.

47
00:03:43,644 --> 00:03:45,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I be honest for a minute, though?

48
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:54,412
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how sometimes folks assume, because we do this podcast in our spare time and everything, that we play every single game that's out there and stuff, but that's not true.

49
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:55,413
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have time to play everything.

50
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:55,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be honest.

51
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:58,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Devil May Cry is one of those series I never have played.

52
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:03,279
[SPEAKER_07]: As much as I would like it, it looks fun, it looks interesting, I just have never really sat down and played it.

53
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:06,616
[SPEAKER_07]: So to me, this news just kind of made me go, meh, that sucks for Sony.

54
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:09,498
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I didn't, that was pretty much all I said.

55
00:04:09,578 --> 00:04:17,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't really like, oh my god, you know, this whole thing, because I'm not like super into Devil May Cry, because again, I've just never, it's one of those series I just haven't had a chance to get into.

56
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:20,542
[SPEAKER_05]: If they lose Final Fantasy XIII, that's going to be hard.

57
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:28,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, for me, that's a big deal, because Metal Gear Solid, I am not that into that series as I am Final Fantasy.

58
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:32,868
[SPEAKER_07]: If Final Fantasy XIII has lost to the Xbox 360, I have zero reason to get a PlayStation 3.

59
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:34,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly.

60
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:45,411
[SPEAKER_05]: My thinking, though, in this, and this is just kind of going back to what they did with the Final Fantasy VII series, is that they're going to release a version on PlayStation 3, and they're going to release a different version on the Xbox 360.

61
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:50,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they're going to have something else on the PSP, and then they're going to have something else on the DS.

62
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:57,576
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the kind of, do these ten title releases for one game type thing, you know, like they did with Final Fantasy VII.

63
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:00,017
[SPEAKER_05]: How uber ridiculous that was.

64
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,238
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

65
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:04,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And the game could suck.

66
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

67
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:44,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I guess I'd give that, although, well, Sony does have, again, the track record, that's kind of what I'm looking at right now, when PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and maybe that's not a fair comparison, but you kind of think that, okay, well, if it was that way before, but I get what you're saying, you know, they didn't have Mistwalker last time, and that's a pretty big something something, I'll give you that.

68
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:45,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me a break for forgetting Blue Dragon.

69
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been out of town the past four days.

70
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:49,435
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to keep using that as my excuse as much as I can.

71
00:05:50,336 --> 00:05:53,777
[SPEAKER_07]: James Patrick says, also, Final Fantasy XIII uses the white engine.

72
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:57,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Unreal Engine 3 is being used for something they haven't announced.

73
00:05:58,118 --> 00:06:00,239
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would bet it's a spinoff.

74
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is something else.

75
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,601
[SPEAKER_05]: They are going to be announcing something new during that May Final Fantasy party or whatever.

76
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:07,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

77
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:10,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Jumpman says, maybe Kingdom Hearts 3 for Unreal.

78
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:11,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

79
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:14,273
[SPEAKER_07]: or how about a new series out of Squeenix?

80
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:16,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it wouldn't kill them to come up with a new series, would it?

81
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:17,617
[SPEAKER_05]: True.

82
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:22,502
[SPEAKER_05]: However, though, fear not, Sony, because not all is lost.

83
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:34,294
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, you may remember, I don't know, a while ago, there was a partnership between Namco Bandai and Sony called Celis or Celius, I guess.

84
00:06:35,015 --> 00:07:04,158
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's a brand new partnership that they are creating some brand new games including three games that have been announced so far and actually they showed up in Famitsu Magazine Brave Arms which appears to be like a third person action game kind of like Ninja Gaiden there was another game called Chain Limit which is kind of a James Bond or Jack Bauer style spy adventure game and Second Season 1 which is a first person drama sci-fi action title

85
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:09,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And I gotta say, from looking at the screenshots of it in Fumitsu Magazine, those look damn good.

86
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So, way to go.

87
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:14,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's some good stuff right there.

88
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:18,375
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they just need to have some more exclusive titles to them that look really nice.

89
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, people will be all over that stuff.

90
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:23,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they look really nice.

91
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:24,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait for these games to come out.

92
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so kind of moving along here.

93
00:07:31,536 --> 00:07:32,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Night, Night, Night, Night

94
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:59,148
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, it's coming out, and if you think so at this point that it's not, you're an idiot, or you're the biggest conspiracy theorist in the world.

95
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:00,368
[SPEAKER_07]: It is coming out.

96
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:00,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Period.

97
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:07,010
[SPEAKER_05]: One person, though, that's not really interested in the New Knights game is Yuji Naka.

98
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:20,153
[SPEAKER_05]: He's basically saying that at the present, I have no such intentions to create another game in the franchise, so much like Katamari, it will probably live on without him.

99
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:26,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Duke Nukem Forever Duke Nukem Forever

100
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:52,751
[SPEAKER_05]: and hopefully we'll be out soon.

101
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:57,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Other info... Wasn't there some type of promise it was going to be out before the end of the year?

102
00:08:57,593 --> 00:08:59,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it last year?

103
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:00,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

104
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:01,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, fuck it.

105
00:09:02,014 --> 00:09:03,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even listen to them anymore.

106
00:09:04,355 --> 00:09:05,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other interesting stuff, though.

107
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:12,417
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rumored that the composer for Elder Scrolls Oblivion has jumped on board to score Duke Nukem Forever.

108
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:14,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And a couple of things hinting to that.

109
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:20,699
[SPEAKER_05]: 3D Realms developer Raphael Van Lietrop, it looks like, discussed in his blog about a recent visit

110
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:24,860
[SPEAKER_05]: from Julian Soul, the guy who did the score.

111
00:09:25,301 --> 00:09:31,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, in Insider's only interview at IGN, Jeremy left one hint about his secretive upcoming project.

112
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:32,585
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, when it's done.

113
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:35,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that was another quote that they had for Duke Nukem.

114
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:44,512
[SPEAKER_07]: We should get him on the show, because we had some guy from that site where they sell his music previously on the program, and we were going to try and get an interview with that guy.

115
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:46,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can try and beat him down for the details.

116
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:49,015
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's an excellent composer.

117
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:50,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Oblivion had some incredible music.

118
00:09:51,229 --> 00:10:18,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And as did, you know, Prey, he did the music for that as well And Prey had some pretty awesome songs in it But also Guild Wars has a really great soundtrack If you've ever listened to it And he did that as well So that's pretty exciting if he's doing Duke Nukem Forever But that's a very, I mean, you know, Oblivion and Guild Wars are very, you know, medieval type You know, have a certain sound to them I would see, obviously, Duke Nukem Forever's score sounding a little more like the Prey But, I don't know, it could be interesting Could be interesting He's a talented guy

119
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:24,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since we're talking about stuff coming out, might as well start talking about what's coming out this week.

120
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:28,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to start off here real quick with what's coming out in the UK.

121
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:34,621
[SPEAKER_05]: And you had lots of stuff this week, of course, with the PlayStation, well, last week with the PlayStation 3 launch and whatnot.

122
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:47,432
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, though, we've got some good stuff coming out for you, including we've got this week Gran Turismo 4 Mobile, although I would believe that when I see it, because I haven't heard anything about that.

123
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:48,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if I'll believe that, but

124
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:52,246
[SPEAKER_05]: God of War 2 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2.

125
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:56,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Fear is coming out on PlayStation 3 for you guys.

126
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:59,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that game has been delayed forever over here.

127
00:10:59,367 --> 00:10:59,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

128
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:00,527
[SPEAKER_07]: You're doing the Euro dates.

129
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:00,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind.

130
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, didn't God of War 2 already come out over here?

131
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:04,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it did.

132
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:06,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

133
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:09,149
[SPEAKER_05]: 300 March of Glory is finally making its way out to the PSP.

134
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:12,570
[SPEAKER_05]: After Burner Black Falcon is also coming out.

138
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,150

139
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,110
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a pretty cool lineup.

140
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I guess, looks like a Heat Seeker on the Wii and the PSP.

141
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully that stuff comes out here pretty soon.

142

145
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:52,972
[SPEAKER_05]: For the U.S., we've got some good stuff coming out.

146
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:55,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, this week, not a whole lot.

147
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:59,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a few movie tie-ins, like, for example, Meet the Robinsons.

148
00:11:59,694 --> 00:12:01,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Got some games coming out for that.

149
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:07,036
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox 360, the Wii, the DS, the Game Boy Advance, and PSP.

150
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:10,237
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, lots of systems for that game.

151
00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:12,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, on...

152

00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:24,370

[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

155

[SPEAKER_05]: The Shivering Isles

157
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:56,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to spend the hundred hours to just explore every nook and cranny.

158
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,853
[SPEAKER_05]: If you happen to be in the mood for some really weird PC titles, I've got a couple titles.

159
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:03,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I think these have to be my favorites for the week.

160
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:07,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Granny 3 on the PC.

161
00:13:07,897 --> 00:13:09,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Rad, what do you do in Super Granny 3?

162
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:14,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure, but it looks pretty awesome.

163
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently... Gilf 3.

164
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:43,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Granny 3 but that's still not my favorite title my favorite title has to be this Alien Disco Safari that one is that has to be my favorite title of the week and that's going to be coming out no idea but maybe we'll see Super Granny 4 meets the Alien Disco Safari Granny's Alien Disco Safari 4 winner Cabela's Alien Disco Safari

165
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:44,624
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

166
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:48,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I haven't been good for much this week, but at least maybe I can get out some Japanese release dates.

167
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:48,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Would that be okay?

168
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,651
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be okay.

169
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:50,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any exclusives, by the way?

170
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:52,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hear any of the good stuff.

171
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,467
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't really have too much to announce.

172
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:56,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you know, not a big surprise.

173
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this has been announced originally.

174
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,469
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they were doing Guitar Hero 80s edition or something.

175
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:02,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was no surprise.

176
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:03,189
[SPEAKER_05]: That's coming out in June.

177
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,189
[SPEAKER_07]: You landed a date.

178
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,670
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it was weird.

179
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,451
[SPEAKER_07]: We got linked from, like, some, like, punk rock music news site linked that.

180
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:14,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, a lot of folks kind of forgot that they've already said they're doing an 80s edition or they've hinted at it.

181
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:18,593
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of folks are kind of taking that as, you know, news for the first time.

182
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:20,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, it's this.

183
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:21,472
[SPEAKER_05]: This stuff is nothing new.

184
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:26,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I just thought I'd point it out because everyone's, you know, got a big boner over Guitar Hero.

185
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:31,314
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, especially with the new game coming out next week, you know, so that's going to be big.

186
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:32,494
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

187
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:33,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Look forward to more Guitar Hero.

188
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:37,455
[SPEAKER_05]: They're definitely keeping up with their promise with releasing multiple releases throughout the week.

189
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:41,296
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not the only franchise that's promised to do that, and we'll get into that a little bit later.

190
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:44,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Japanese release dates.

191
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:46,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I get into those, looking at the chat room here,

192
00:14:47,744 --> 00:14:48,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

193
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:50,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Meklar says, Super Granny 3, you have to save cats.

194
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,028
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be a joke.

195
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:53,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

196
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And then ShadowNextGen says, Shivering Isles is coming out the day Xbox Live is down.

197
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:00,094
[SPEAKER_07]: LOL.

198
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:04,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And Joshi16 follows up that with, it's only down for 14 hours.

199
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:04,858
[SPEAKER_07]: It's official.

200
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:07,940
[SPEAKER_07]: But don't those things usually take longer than they say they do?

201
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, apparently it's not for anything specific.

202
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:15,506
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they had a lot of work to do on the back end, so they're kind of doing that right now.

203
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:27,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Going back in chat to the Duke Nukem Forever chat, TheRobD from This Day in Gaming says, I like how the creators of DNF, Duke Nukem Forever, actually take responsibility for screwing it up.

204
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,800
[SPEAKER_07]: They have no excuses, just we screwed up.

205
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,221
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura made a cameo on This Day in Gaming this week, by the way.

206
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:36,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Check that out, it's hilarious.

207
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:38,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Japanese release dates.

208
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:49,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox 360 gets Absolute Blazing Infinity, Call of Duty 3, and Asia gets the release of Rayman Raving Rabbids all on the 29th of March.

209
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:58,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Mizase Surimaster is coming out from Hudson for the Nintendo Wii.

210
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:02,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And this looks to be some type of sports title that's coming out.

211
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,002
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like it involves fishing.

212
00:16:05,022 --> 00:16:07,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Hasn't this been announced for the U.S.

213
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:08,044
[SPEAKER_07]: as some other name?

214
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:09,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it looks like it's all fishing.

215
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:10,451
[SPEAKER_07]: is what it is.

216
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Some type of fishing game.

217
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw some screenshots for this.

218
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:15,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

219
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:18,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe somebody in chat room would know more information about that whole thing.

220
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:19,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

221
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:22,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Also coming out on the... Well, that's it.

222
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:28,937
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get some controller covers and stuff for like $5, $10 on Nintendo Wii.

223
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:33,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Raven and Raven Rabbids is coming out because that's another game that they kind of delayed.

224
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,839
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very last minute too.

225
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:37,400
[SPEAKER_05]: It was supposed to be coming out this week and then I think it got moved to May.

226
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:37,840
[SPEAKER_07]: For the 360.

227
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,461
[SPEAKER_07]: For the 360.

228
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:39,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

229
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:48,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Winning Post 7 Maximum 2007 on the 29th of March for the PlayStation 3.

230
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:50,324
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a horsey racing game.

231
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:53,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy your horsey racing if you are into that.

232
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:59,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out over on the PlayStation 2, Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix.

233
00:16:59,445 --> 00:17:01,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I know a lot of folks are very excited about that.

234
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Vitamin X. I like the name of this game.

235
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:06,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Vitamin X is coming out.

236
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,727
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a limited edition available.

237
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:13,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if this is based on an anime or what, because I haven't been keeping tabs on my anime, but it's certainly got one of those covers.

238
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:15,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess, you know a lot about anime.

239
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:16,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Vitamin X an anime?

240
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:16,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never heard of it.

241
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:17,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

242
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Vitamin X?

243
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,260
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

244
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,701
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a little cover there.

245
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:22,262
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an action game.

246
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,743
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not ringing a bell for me.

247
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:25,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe somebody in chat knows.

248
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:26,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Couldn't tell you that one there.

249
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:31,087
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, this other one, this sounds like a very interesting game coming out in Japan.

250
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:37,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Gouken Utopia, Manabi Straight, Kira Kira Happy Festa is coming out.

251
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:41,929
[SPEAKER_07]: and this is an adventure game with a bunch of girly anime characters on the cover.

252
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like a chibi punch and kick game.

253
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,350
[SPEAKER_07]: But it has a cute name.

254
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:46,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

255
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So have fun with that.

256
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:50,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if anything else is coming out of the other systems.

257
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:51,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Nintendo DS.

258
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:52,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Digimon.

259
00:17:52,493 --> 00:17:54,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Two Digimon games coming out from Bandai.

260
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:56,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Moonlight and Sunburst.

261
00:17:56,994 --> 00:18:00,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really say what Vitamin X is, but it says it's a love adventure game by D3.

262
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:02,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, a love adventure game, huh?

263
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that mean it's like a dating sim?

264
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:04,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

265
00:18:05,658 --> 00:18:05,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

266
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:06,498
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

267
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,146
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much all I got for you guys over in Japan.

268
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:12,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun with your chibi girly fighting game.

269
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:18,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the US is going to see something else coming soon to your local video store, I guess.

270
00:18:20,492 --> 00:18:35,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Blu-ray or a Blu-ray release of the classic video game and arcade classic, Dragon's Lair will be coming out soon and not really a big surprise because it's been out on DVD for a while now and they expect that

271
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,382
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be on HD DVD at some point, and it's going to be sold for $49.95.

272
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:42,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Yikes, that's quite expensive.

273
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:45,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how you could really, well, I don't know.

274
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:50,106
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the graphics were probably as good as you can get on Dragon's Lair.

275
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:52,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can't really re-enhance it anymore.

276
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:54,528
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems a little bit pointless to me.

277
00:18:54,828 --> 00:19:04,692
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, Dragon's Lair has kind of already been done, you know, on DVD, and that's about as, I mean, the original was on Laserdisc.

278
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:07,342
[SPEAKER_07]: and it wasn't that pretty.

279
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:08,382
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, did they clean it up?

280
00:19:08,422 --> 00:19:09,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they do anything to it?

281
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I can see.

282
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:11,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

283
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:15,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there you have it.

284
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:18,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Dragon's Lair a reason to buy a $600 PlayStation 3?

285
00:19:19,126 --> 00:19:19,386
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

286
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:21,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, says Miklatov.

287
00:19:22,827 --> 00:19:23,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Miklatov's just fucking with us.

288
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:24,828
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just kidding.

289
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:33,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, another... Now, release Super Granny 3 on Blu-ray and we're talking or Ultimate Duck Hunter from the bonus segment tonight or whatever the fuck that game was.

290
00:19:33,624 --> 00:19:34,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimate Duck Hunting

291
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:54,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Jake Gyllenhaal

292
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:20,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of stuff that's been delayed, Calling All Cars.

293
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:25,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Brand new game that's supposed to be coming out to the PlayStation Network.

294
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,379
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be one of their downloadable games.

295
00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:32,864
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been moved to April and this is done by the same guy that did God of War, David Jeff.

296
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:40,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, I don't know, he's just hit a roadblock as far as putting it out on the PlayStation Network.

297
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Never really given any reasons why.

298
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:45,273
[SPEAKER_05]: They did have some gameplay footage of it and it

299
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:51,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, though, I mean, he's not trying to compete with, like, a Halo or anything, or even God of War or this.

300
00:20:52,769 --> 00:20:55,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still saying it looks like crap.

301
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says it's all about the fun factor.

302
00:20:58,491 --> 00:20:59,391
[SPEAKER_05]: It did not look fun at all.

303
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:00,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

304
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:01,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked pretty boring.

305
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:05,032
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hopefully I'm wrong, and it'll come out to be pretty fun.

306
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:07,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

307
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:08,093
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to see.

308
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully they release a demo.

309
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:10,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

310
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:13,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Another game that's getting yet another release, especially next week.

311
00:21:13,915 --> 00:21:16,336
[SPEAKER_05]: They have SingStar Pop coming out over here.

312
00:21:16,696 --> 00:21:17,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not all.

313
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:22,779
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be seeing six SingStars come out by next year.

314
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:24,760
[SPEAKER_05]: On PlayStation 2 or mixed?

315
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:28,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I think both because I know PlayStation 3 is getting SingStar coming out.

316
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:33,725
[SPEAKER_07]: But wasn't PlayStation 3 only supposed to get like one SingStar and that's it?

317
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:35,886
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they download everything with that?

318
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:36,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think so.

319
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:37,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

320
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,311
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I mean, you never know.

321
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:43,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember originally Karaoke Revolution was going to have add-ons to it and that never happened?

322
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:46,794
[SPEAKER_07]: They figured out, hey, we can... We got like a couple packs here, a couple packs there.

323
00:21:47,154 --> 00:21:48,814
[SPEAKER_05]: We can sell whole games and make more money.

324
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:53,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, that's scary and I'm not playing any of them.

325
00:21:53,475 --> 00:21:57,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Actdeft was asking in chat the ultimate question, will Loki buy it?

326
00:21:57,576 --> 00:21:58,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not touch this.

327
00:21:58,057 --> 00:21:59,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And will we put it on YouTube?

328
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:00,397
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I will not touch this game.

329
00:22:00,517 --> 00:22:02,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if I get it free, I will be burning it.

330
00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:06,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a horrible, horrible, horrible game.

331
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:06,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Karaoke...

332
00:22:07,352 --> 00:22:09,994
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

333
00:22:31,713 --> 00:22:34,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRater.com if you'd like to send us an email.

334
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:39,016
[SPEAKER_07]: I just randomly picked a few emails for this week, so I apologize if I didn't get to you tonight.

335
00:22:39,336 --> 00:22:40,977
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll just have to deal with that rejection.

336
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:46,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start with an email from Meklar, who writes to say, Just a quick email to say, you rock!

337
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:51,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And a quick little tidbit I heard from a friend who recently left the employment of Sega.

338
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:56,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Nights is coming to the Wii, but also seems to be heading to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, too!

339
00:22:58,064 --> 00:23:10,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Seems to her, the game now plays like the magic carpet from Sonic and the Secret Rings.

340
00:23:10,826 --> 00:23:12,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Either way, it's something I've not heard before.

341
00:23:12,587 --> 00:23:13,767
[SPEAKER_07]: How about you guys and Gal?

342
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:23,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely I knew about the Wii through something similar, like a friend of a friend at Sega, but I did not hear of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

343
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:24,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting, if true.

344
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:25,549
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes sense, though.

345
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:26,669
[SPEAKER_07]: It does make sense.

346
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:31,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, Knights is one of those franchises I think people have been wanting to see come back for a while.

347
00:23:31,298 --> 00:23:32,839
[SPEAKER_07]: So, very interesting.

348
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:34,439
[SPEAKER_07]: I want new Rez.

349
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Me too, but too bad it's a different company altogether.

350
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:39,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you for the email.

351
00:23:40,142 --> 00:23:43,064
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an email from Sakura Max.

352
00:23:44,404 --> 00:23:46,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Says, Dear OLR, first order of business.

353
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:47,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, don't be such a tit.

354
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:49,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop the accent.

355
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,707
[SPEAKER_07]: You disgrace my friends.

356
00:23:51,588 --> 00:23:53,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody's taking issue to my British accent.

357
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:55,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I do hear on the program sometimes.

358
00:23:55,229 --> 00:23:56,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be such a tit about it.

359
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:58,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Just teasing.

360
00:23:58,443 --> 00:24:02,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess part of the charm is that my accents are so horrible, I don't know what else to tell you.

361
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Second order of business, Jamie.

362
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:11,508
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason I say Rondo of Blood sucks is because it's on PSP, one of the consoles I don't own, and I've lost my loyalty to Sony.

363
00:24:12,508 --> 00:24:16,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, though, with some of these big games, it seems like they're trying to woo some people back to PSP.

364
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it too little, too late?

365
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

366
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:19,050
[SPEAKER_07]: You think so?

367
00:24:20,131 --> 00:24:26,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there a story this week, and I don't know if it's something upcoming, forgive me, but I want to say I read something on the internet before I left for my trip that said that

368
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:32,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Retailers are getting pissed that Sony will not do a price cut on the PSP, and some are threatening to just get the damn thing off their shelves.

369
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:36,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was at the PlayStation, or Destination PlayStation show.

370
00:24:36,155 --> 00:24:41,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently they were demanding that the price be lowered for the system.

371
00:24:42,236 --> 00:24:45,677
[SPEAKER_05]: I did see, though, what they were, GameStop was doing a special this week.

372
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:50,298
[SPEAKER_05]: They had the, was it the, they had like a bundle pack a long time ago.

373
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:55,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when the PlayStation Portable first came out where it had like the case and the memory stick and stuff like that?

374
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently now they don't have that.

375
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,172
[SPEAKER_05]: The core system is just PSP, charger, done.

376
00:25:02,392 --> 00:25:07,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So now they were offering that one at $199 because originally it was $250.

377
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:10,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of a markdown, but yeah.

378
00:25:11,255 --> 00:25:14,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think they're probably going to redesign it or something.

379
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:16,097
[SPEAKER_05]: So get people to buy it again.

380
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:16,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Bastards.

381
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, there you go.

382
00:25:18,915 --> 00:25:23,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, DarkSakura was not here tonight to respond to your comment, but if we remember, we'll tell her next week.

383
00:25:23,677 --> 00:25:26,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Third order of business, I just got DDR Supernova on my arcade.

384
00:25:27,198 --> 00:25:29,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations on being about six months late to that party.

385
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:30,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.

386
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:37,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Fourth order of business, DDR Supernova might not be too good, considering the fact that the first one wasn't too successful.

387
00:25:38,081 --> 00:25:44,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not... Yeah, I'm not sure I understand that statement, because what... What first one are we basing it off of?

388
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, do we mean like DDR Supernova...

389
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,506
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Supernova Supernova 2 Arcade

390
00:26:16,244 --> 00:26:21,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Sakura Max is the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old and signs that email and says, P.S.

391
00:26:21,966 --> 00:26:22,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Duskcap.

392
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:24,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

393
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:25,807
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what he says in his email.

394
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:28,148
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old.

395
00:26:28,448 --> 00:26:30,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Do your parents know you listen to this?

396
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:30,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Shame on you.

397
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:37,030
[SPEAKER_11]: That closing statement right there just makes you realize why a 12-year-old shouldn't be on the internet.

398
00:26:40,572 --> 00:26:40,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.

399
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.

400
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, you're so awesome.

401
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:46,901
[SPEAKER_05]: N.A.I.F.

402
00:27:04,782 --> 00:27:07,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Last week you asked us to send you our favorite jokes.

403
00:27:08,144 --> 00:27:10,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is my all-time favorite joke.

404
00:27:10,525 --> 00:27:12,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Because remember last week we had the email?

405
00:27:12,146 --> 00:27:12,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

406
00:27:12,426 --> 00:27:13,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely forgot about it last week.

407
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:14,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here we go.

408
00:27:15,227 --> 00:27:17,088
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a joke back.

409
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:20,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, we do remember we said voicemail, not email.

410
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:20,990
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

411
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't think we got really any voicemails.

412
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:23,671
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

413
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:24,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't check.

414
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:25,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I've been kind of gone.

415
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:27,033
[SPEAKER_07]: So, here we go.

416
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:33,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's an old one, but every time I tell it to my friends, they really enjoy it, and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

417
00:27:33,677 --> 00:27:39,260
[SPEAKER_07]: So Rice, Princess, and Loki and Miklatov will be our judges on how funny this joke is.

418
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like American Idol for jokes.

419
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:41,982
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be funny.

420
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:42,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Something like that.

421
00:27:42,842 --> 00:27:46,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I kind of feel like we should have some music that plays with this or something.

422
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:51,207
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we should have some joke-telling music while we read the rest of this email.

423
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:52,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to play some joke-telling music.

424
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:52,948
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready?

425
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:54,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

426
00:27:58,164 --> 00:28:07,487
[SPEAKER_07]: One day, the teacher walks into her classroom and announces to the class that on each Friday, she will ask a question to the class and anyone who answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the following Monday.

427
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:12,049
[SPEAKER_07]: On the first Friday, the teacher asks, how many grains of sand are in the beach?

428
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:14,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Needless to say, no one could answer.

429
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,071
[SPEAKER_07]: The following Friday, the teacher asks the class, how many stars are in the sky?

430
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:20,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, no one could answer.

431
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:27,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Frustrated, little Johnny decides that the next Friday, he would somehow answer the question and get a three-day weekend.

432
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:32,074
[SPEAKER_07]: So Thursday night, Johnny takes two ping pong balls and paints them black.

433
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,154
[SPEAKER_07]: The next day, he brings them to school in a paper bag.

434
00:28:35,634 --> 00:28:44,056
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of the day, just when the teacher says, here's this week's question, Johnny empties the bag to the floor, sending the ping pong balls rolling to the front of the room.

435
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:49,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they are young kids who find any disruption of class amusing, the entire class starts laughing.

436
00:28:50,237 --> 00:28:53,898
[SPEAKER_07]: The teacher says, okay, who's the comedian with the black balls?

437
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Immediately, little Johnny stands up and says, Bill Cosby, see you on Tuesday.

438
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:03,633
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty funny.

439
00:29:03,693 --> 00:29:06,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I got one laugh in the room, a little chuckle from Loki.

440
00:29:06,414 --> 00:29:07,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I have bacon.

441
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:10,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you laughing at the bacon or are you laughing at the joke?

442
00:29:10,255 --> 00:29:10,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Joke.

443
00:29:10,695 --> 00:29:10,935
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

444
00:29:11,495 --> 00:29:13,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go around and judge that scale on 1 to 10.

445
00:29:13,556 --> 00:29:14,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be like the gong show here.

446
00:29:14,656 --> 00:29:15,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we going to gong the joke?

447
00:29:16,357 --> 00:29:18,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Rice Princess, on a scale of 1 to 10, how was the joke?

448
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:21,899
[SPEAKER_02]: W. W?

449
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:22,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

450
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:23,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

451
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:25,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki on a scale of 1 to 10, how was that joke?

452
00:29:27,024 --> 00:29:27,725
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be like a 7.

453
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:31,126
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely an intelligent joke.

454
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:33,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard it before, so props for that.

455
00:29:33,827 --> 00:29:34,628
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

456
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:35,588
[SPEAKER_07]: It was good.

457
00:29:35,928 --> 00:29:37,209
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and Mikozov?

458
00:29:37,229 --> 00:29:37,209
1.

459
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,090
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, why such a low score?

460
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Because talking about Bill Cosby's balls is never a good thing, and it's not funny.

461
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:44,752
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gross.

462
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:45,252
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

463
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:45,672
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

464
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:49,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think this is going to encourage people to send us more jokes?

465
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:49,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

466
00:29:49,894 --> 00:29:51,054
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 for the bacon.

467
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:54,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Gods and Heroes Rome Rising

468
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:27,715
[SPEAKER_07]: A brief description of our game is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game set to Roman mythology.

469
00:30:27,735 --> 00:30:29,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, I have the hiccups during this poor email.

470
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:37,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Some key features is being able to play your hero character however you like with six different classes and an extensive character customization.

471
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:43,781
[SPEAKER_07]: You also get to control up to eight minions at a time as well as have a visceral experience.

472
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:45,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I like D&L's use of vis, where is there?

473
00:30:45,902 --> 00:30:46,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Visceral.

474
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:46,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Visceral.

475
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,559
[SPEAKER_02]: What's visceral?

476
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:49,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I'm probably pronouncing it wrong.

477
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,500
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean, visceral?

478
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Visceral, yeah, sure, visceral experience.

479
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:53,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Visceral.

480
00:30:53,822 --> 00:30:54,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten!

481
00:30:57,284 --> 00:30:57,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you all.

482
00:30:57,764 --> 00:30:59,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, that was the best joke ever.

483
00:30:59,105 --> 00:31:00,425
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, never leave me again.

484
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:02,747
[SPEAKER_07]: With paired combat animation.

485
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:09,510
[SPEAKER_07]: If interested, please sign up in our very active forums at community.godsandheroes.com Love and pointy things DNL.

486
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,912
[SPEAKER_07]: So I like how DNL is using our mailbag to spam her game, but we'll give her that right here.

487
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:14,653
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact...

488
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:18,590
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, why doesn't D&L get us an interview with peoples from the game?

489
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,170
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll take them.

490
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:29,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if I can do anything and I can control up to eight minions, can I, like, sit back and, like, drink ale and have my minions, like, kill things while I just sit there and not do anything?

491
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:32,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I get level, you know, experience points for that?

492
00:31:33,476 --> 00:31:33,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

493
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:35,697
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

494
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:36,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Folks, let's see.

495
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:40,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Blackboy in chat says, wait, Sky's reading an ad that was thinly disguised as an email.

496
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess.

497
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:44,420
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was from a friend of ours, so I'm okay with it.

498
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:47,748
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game I hadn't heard about before, so there you have it.

499
00:31:48,768 --> 00:31:50,729
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll check it out and give an honest opinion either way.

500
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:52,269
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you have it.

501
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:53,009
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it for the mailbag.

502
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:55,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you'd like to send us emails.

503
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:08,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, earlier we were talking a little bit, we mentioned that the Shivering Isles was coming out for the Xbox, well, for Oblivion on PC and Xbox 360, but it was going to be downloadable on the 360.

504
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:15,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Conveniently enough, there is some other stuff you can download off of Microsoft's Marketplace

505
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, you cannot download porn, as Mikulatov would say.

506
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:21,504
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not available yet.

507
00:32:22,005 --> 00:32:25,287
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they do need a porno channel on the IPTV thing.

508
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:27,429
[SPEAKER_05]: That would sell systems.

509
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:32,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, Jetpack, or the new Jetpack game is coming out.

510
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:36,816
[SPEAKER_05]: If you might remember Rare's kind of little logo there.

511
00:32:37,697 --> 00:32:42,981
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, yeah, Jetpack Refueled will be hitting the marketplace on Wednesday.

512
00:32:43,782 --> 00:32:44,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will feature...

513
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:50,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Obscenely Colorful Graphics, whatever that's supposed to mean.

514
00:32:50,864 --> 00:32:53,486
[SPEAKER_05]: It's obscene.

515
00:32:53,506 --> 00:32:56,288
[SPEAKER_05]: 128 levels, multiplayer capabilities.

516
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:57,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Multiplayer capabilities.

517
00:32:58,089 --> 00:32:58,929
[SPEAKER_07]: See, this is porn.

518
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:06,595
[SPEAKER_05]: The original arcade version and continued exclusion of the letter K from the

519
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:10,087
[SPEAKER_07]: And money shots, says Miklatov.

520
00:33:10,147 --> 00:33:16,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be available on the marketplace and will cost you 400 Microsoft points or $5 in real money.

521
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Miklatov, you're giving this the thumbs down.

522
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this one of those other games you've probably played that you're not supposed to talk about?

523
00:33:22,571 --> 00:33:23,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it suck?

524
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:24,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you talk about it?

525
00:33:26,424 --> 00:33:27,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does it suck?

526
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's not fun to play.

527
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:30,288
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell do you do?

528
00:33:30,568 --> 00:33:35,914
[SPEAKER_11]: You shoot things and then you fly away and it's really boring and it's not Boom Boom Rocket, so why are we talking about it?

529
00:33:36,555 --> 00:33:37,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the people want to know.

530
00:33:37,836 --> 00:33:39,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they don't anymore.

531
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:41,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, I suppose.

532
00:33:42,942 --> 00:33:47,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, this week, and Jamie will love this, but

533
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:56,613
[SPEAKER_05]: On the Xbox Live Marketplace, they had brand new heroes and villains that you could download to expand Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

534
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:09,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And it featured eight new playable characters, including the Incredible Hulk, Magneto, Hawkeye, Sabretooth, Doctor Doom, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Venom.

535
00:34:09,961 --> 00:34:15,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, you've got brand new signature power skins,

536
00:34:16,411 --> 00:34:19,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Dialogue, Conversations, and Achievement Points.

537
00:34:20,213 --> 00:34:22,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't Cyclops one-eyed?

538
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:25,315
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

539
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:27,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Total porn on Xbox Live Marketplace.

540
00:34:27,435 --> 00:34:29,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they want you to download one-eyed monsters on Xbox Live.

541
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:32,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Does he blast stuff out of his one eye?

542
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Total porn.

543
00:34:34,618 --> 00:34:36,019
[SPEAKER_07]: He doesn't have one eye.

544
00:34:36,819 --> 00:34:38,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't Cyclops mean one eye?

545
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,682
[SPEAKER_07]: One-eyed monster that shoots things.

546
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a penis.

547
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:48,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they have it divided up into two different packs.

548
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:50,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there's no need to go there, Rice Princess.

549
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:51,357
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just dirty.

550
00:34:52,097 --> 00:34:52,497
[SPEAKER_07]: It's disgusting.

551
00:34:52,517 --> 00:34:58,681
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a hero and villain pack, each of which were 500 points, or $6.25.

552
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:05,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, you can also buy the combo pack, which features both, and save a little bit of money.

553
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:06,945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 800 Microsoft points, or $10.

554
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:08,245
[SPEAKER_05]: So, saving a good $2.50 there.

555
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:20,550
[SPEAKER_05]: and also they have heroes and villains gamer picks that you can download and those are each 80 Microsoft points or $1.

556
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And chatroom, yes, I was kidding.

557
00:35:24,912 --> 00:35:26,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course I know who Cyclops is.

558
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:27,814
[SPEAKER_07]: I did see the X-Men movies.

559
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:29,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched the cartoon when I was a kid.

560
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:29,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

561
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:31,516
[SPEAKER_07]: James Marsters.

562
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:35,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, now let's talk about a game.

563
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:37,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you laughing at me?

564
00:35:38,961 --> 00:35:39,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're funny.

565
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:40,917
[SPEAKER_02]: and Visceral.

566
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:42,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to hell.

567
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:47,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's talk about a game that came out a couple weeks ago.

568
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Ghost Recon 2 Advanced Warfare 2.

569
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:57,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, Mexico doesn't like the game too much.

570
00:35:58,062 --> 00:36:01,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it has something to do with the Mexican terrorists in the game.

571
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:02,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck Mexico!

572
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:02,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Actdeft.

573
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:03,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

574
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:13,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what's most interesting about this story though, because apparently the game has been blacklisted, and I want to say Chihuahua, Mexico?

575
00:36:13,846 --> 00:36:15,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there such a thing as a Chihuahua, Mexico?

576
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, but it has nothing to do with the dog.

577
00:36:18,114 --> 00:36:20,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a weed California, Loki.

578
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:23,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Towns get names weird things all the time.

579
00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:27,161
[SPEAKER_05]: But weed makes sense, though, because weeds are just out there, and that just happens to be slang.

580
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:28,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Chihuahua's not slang.

581
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:29,663
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dog.

582
00:36:29,903 --> 00:36:33,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Or Chihuahua's like, you know, they're an animal that runs around in parks like we have squirrels.

583
00:36:34,587 --> 00:36:36,188
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mexico hates it because they don't bathe.

584
00:36:37,216 --> 00:36:39,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway... Wow.

585
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,281
[SPEAKER_07]: The views and opinions expressed.

586
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:52,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft says, and it's a state, like, you know, how... Well, it's not really a state, but, you know... Anyways, so Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior Fighter 2 has been blacklisted in Chihuahua, Mexico, and...

587
00:36:53,610 --> 00:37:06,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides the fact that the city's got a weird name, there has been apparently orders, Mexico has apparently ordered the confiscation of any and all copies of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 that surface in the state.

588
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:10,515
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a site report from El Dario.

589
00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:14,096
[SPEAKER_05]: El Dario.

590
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:19,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that also a town named after the water?

591
00:37:19,757 --> 00:37:22,878
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not El Dario, it's

592
00:37:23,346 --> 00:37:24,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's El Diero.

593
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:27,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

594
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:35,432
[SPEAKER_05]: A Mexican broadsheet which says that the action was taken after Mayor Hector I'm not even going to start pronouncing these names.

595
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:42,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I would fucking buy Ghost Recon if they had El Diario as like a terrorist in it.

596
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:49,218
[SPEAKER_05]: They've slammed the game as being a crime against the intellectual capacity of the Juarez residents.

597
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:50,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Um

598
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:53,344
[SPEAKER_05]: and apparently they've decided to take action.

599
00:37:53,504 --> 00:38:03,386
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in any case, GamePolitics also notes that a statement they took from the mayor who said that violent video games instill values which are upside down.

600
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:11,327
[SPEAKER_05]: These actions are despicable because they attempt to divide the good and wool, a goodwill of the residents of America and Mexican cities.

601
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,908
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you won't be able to get your fix on Ghost Recon Advanced Warfare 2.

602
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:20,009
[SPEAKER_05]: However, God of War 2, I'm sure, is still selling like hotcakes.

603
00:38:20,149 --> 00:38:20,309
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

604
00:38:22,907 --> 00:38:23,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft

605
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:39,687
[SPEAKER_05]: However though, if you want to get in on some of that Ghost Recon Advanced Warfare 2 action, it will be available on the PC.

606
00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:42,288
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing the beta test, which is starting in April.

607
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:51,550
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely go and sign up on the website, which is ghostrecon.uk.ubi.com.

608
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:57,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess this would be the UK beta test, now that I've noticed that.

609
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:03,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so on to a different game.

610
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:11,779
[SPEAKER_05]: If you may not be able to play Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 and you live in Mexico, maybe you want to participate in the beta for Quake Wars.

611
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:17,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Because id Software is looking for some good first-person shooter clans to get in on this beta test.

612
00:39:17,863 --> 00:39:23,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically what you'll need to do is have your clans register for this.

613
00:39:24,307 --> 00:39:29,291
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically you can participate by sending your application to etqw...

614
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:44,085
[SPEAKER_05]: BetaTest at Activision.com and with following your clan name, number of active members, games played regularly and played competitively, your website and details like that.

615
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:48,486
[SPEAKER_07]: 100 OLR achievement points to the first person to make the El Diario clan.

616
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:52,287
[SPEAKER_05]: But Quake Wars looks awesome.

617
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:55,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't wait to play it when it comes out on the 360 PlayStation 3 and PC.

618
00:39:55,888 --> 00:39:55,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Sigh.

619
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:02,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, kind of off to a little bit of a different tangent here.

620
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:06,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Another first person game that's definitely popular out there right now is Gears of War.

621
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:20,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And New Line apparently found time to register the rights for the movie, or secure the rights for the movie, so that they can make yet another horrible video game movie.

622
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:21,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

623
00:40:22,242 --> 00:40:35,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, Variety was reporting that New Line Cinema has snagged rights to Gears of War and that Stuart Beatty will be writing the script with Marty Bowen and Wick Godfrey.

624
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:36,015
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll suck.

625
00:40:36,816 --> 00:40:38,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can't say that I recognize any of those people.

626
00:40:38,718 --> 00:40:39,479
[SPEAKER_07]: How can it be good?

627
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:40,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

628
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:41,761
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll suck like all the other games.

629
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:45,344
[SPEAKER_05]: So the rights went up for auction with a 21-page treatment by Beatty.

630
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:49,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Best known for his script work on Collateral and Derailed.

631
00:41:06,536 --> 00:41:07,356
[SPEAKER_02]: God awful.

632
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:10,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to gouge out my eyes and stuff afterwards.

633
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:13,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it make you want to kill yourself like Ultimate Duck Hunt?

634
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:13,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

635
00:41:13,658 --> 00:41:14,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh man.

636
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,099
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be pretty good.

637
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:26,582
[SPEAKER_11]: They could flesh out the somewhat existent story and actually make something that's entertaining and kind of interesting, which video game movies usually lack.

638
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:29,423
[SPEAKER_11]: At least good entertaining, not like ha-ha entertaining.

639
00:41:29,563 --> 00:41:33,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that idea worked so well with Resident Evil and Doom.

640
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:35,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Resident Evil is decent.

641
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:37,607
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

642
00:41:54,772 --> 00:41:58,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Capcom, why you got against Torch Lounge Radio?

643
00:41:58,774 --> 00:42:00,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Afraid we're going to say something we shouldn't.

644
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:01,436
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell was that?

645
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:02,676
[SPEAKER_08]: My pouty voice.

646
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:03,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my.

647
00:42:04,077 --> 00:42:05,177
[SPEAKER_08]: No love from Capcom.

648
00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:07,158
[SPEAKER_08]: No love from Capcom.

649
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:10,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I was a little hard on Dead Rising, but anyways.

650
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Their Capcom day is going to be April 12th.

651
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,223
[SPEAKER_05]: One game has been announced already.

652
00:42:16,676 --> 00:42:29,942
[SPEAKER_05]: and that would be the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii and that's one thing that they're hoping that will be featured there as well as some info on Resident Evil 5 for the PlayStation 3 and 360.

653
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:37,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing though is they're going to be announcing a brand new game and so we don't know what exactly that is.

654
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:39,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a brand new game.

655
00:42:39,066 --> 00:42:41,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful Joe again or maybe Mega Man.

656
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:41,847
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be nice.

657
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:45,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Miklatov is adamant about a Phoenix Wright 3.

658
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:46,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope not.

659
00:42:48,683 --> 00:42:52,466
[SPEAKER_11]: That's only the best game they've ever had in, like, ten years.

660
00:42:52,686 --> 00:42:53,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Ever.

661
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:54,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Ever in ten years.

662
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,351
[SPEAKER_07]: What about a new Mega Man game?

663
00:42:58,371 --> 00:42:59,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that be kind of cool?

664
00:43:00,332 --> 00:43:02,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's... Well, how about taking Mega Man back to its roots?

665
00:43:03,395 --> 00:43:03,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking it back.

666
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:04,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Taking it back.

667
00:43:04,856 --> 00:43:05,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to its roots.

668
00:43:05,537 --> 00:43:07,158
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great if they did that.

669
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:11,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know what's up with all the... Mega Man Z. Battle Network, whatever crap.

670
00:43:11,461 --> 00:43:13,423
[SPEAKER_05]: They already did Mega Man Z, and it sucked.

671
00:43:13,443 --> 00:43:13,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Mega Man 9.

672
00:43:14,544 --> 00:43:14,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Crap.

673
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:15,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Mega Man 9?

674
00:43:15,805 --> 00:43:17,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd go for that.

675
00:43:17,326 --> 00:43:18,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Mega Man ZX.

676
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Horrible.

677
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,160
[SPEAKER_07]: How about just Mega Man?

678
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,801
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think folks will forgive you if you just want to start over.

679
00:43:23,861 --> 00:43:25,341
[SPEAKER_05]: How about just redo Mega Man Legends?

680
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:26,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Legends was pretty fun.

681
00:43:27,642 --> 00:43:28,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Legends 3.

682
00:43:28,862 --> 00:43:30,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, bring Tron Bon back.

683
00:43:30,962 --> 00:43:31,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I'm done.

684
00:43:31,482 --> 00:43:32,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyways.

685
00:43:34,123 --> 00:43:37,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, this kind of goes... Gotta bring it full circle.

686
00:43:37,643 --> 00:43:39,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

687
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Move over, King Kong!

688
00:43:42,224 --> 00:43:47,405
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a new leader of ultimate easy achievement points, and that is TMNT, the game.

689
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:49,075
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

690
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,527
[SPEAKER_05]: TeamXbox GameSpot

691
00:44:38,627 --> 00:44:44,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Even still, the better graphics and achievements ultimately make the 360 version the best by default.

692
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:46,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

693
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:48,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

694
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:49,991
[SPEAKER_07]: I might check it out.

695
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:52,791
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like something that would be like a rental, but I don't know if I'd buy that.

696
00:44:53,312 --> 00:44:54,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially just for a thousand achievement points.

697
00:44:54,972 --> 00:44:55,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care, you know.

698
00:44:56,252 --> 00:44:59,914
[SPEAKER_07]: The Tetris game I bought today seems to have, you know, okay achievement points.

699
00:44:59,974 --> 00:45:03,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's doable if you are any good at Tetris.

700
00:45:03,915 --> 00:45:04,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you.

701
00:45:04,375 --> 00:45:04,595
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

702
00:45:05,054 --> 00:45:06,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Earth Defense Force 2017.

703
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:09,997
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the dumbest game on the face of the earth, but so fun to play.

704
00:45:10,238 --> 00:45:13,620
[SPEAKER_07]: But do you have easy... Not easy achieving points at all.

705
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, actually, no, probably beating a game on easy and normal would be relatively easy.

706
00:45:18,623 --> 00:45:19,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Although normal is pretty hard.

707
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,205
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what's kind of...

708
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:25,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Skypline is open by the way, username OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype, 1-877-GAME-OLR

709
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:47,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus you unlock different weapons that might help out with playing through the levels at harder difficulty or something like that.

710
00:45:47,632 --> 00:45:49,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of strategy involved there.

711
00:45:49,733 --> 00:45:52,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus it's just so cheesy and stupid that you gotta play it.

712
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:57,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because your other guys will yell weird shit like, Oh no!

713
00:45:57,656 --> 00:45:58,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiny died!

714
00:45:58,816 --> 00:45:59,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no!

715
00:45:59,517 --> 00:46:00,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Big stuff died!

716
00:46:00,877 --> 00:46:01,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

717
00:46:01,698 --> 00:46:05,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to keep playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night right now, to be honest.

718
00:46:05,919 --> 00:46:07,320
[SPEAKER_07]: All over again, like it was the first time.

719
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:07,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.

720
00:46:08,288 --> 00:46:10,108
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a call on the old Skype line.

721
00:46:10,328 --> 00:46:11,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

722
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:11,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

723
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:14,329
[SPEAKER_04]: This is DMN.

724
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:15,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, DMN.

725
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:16,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Long time no talk.

726
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,590
[SPEAKER_04]: This is CNN.

727
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,190
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

728
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't get us sued.

729
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:22,191
[SPEAKER_07]: This is OLR.

730
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:23,231
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, DMN?

731
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:30,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I came across your website a couple days ago, and I noticed the Katamari story got removed.

732
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:32,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

733
00:46:32,113 --> 00:46:32,853
[SPEAKER_07]: You should bring that up.

734
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:36,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what do you want to say about it?

735
00:46:37,934 --> 00:46:38,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

736
00:46:38,706 --> 00:46:41,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck Gamespot and everything it stands for regarding that.

737
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:49,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they pull the story up only a few days after and not even cite Orange Lounge Radio for it?

738
00:46:50,655 --> 00:46:52,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't comment on this at this time.

739
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:57,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week we'll have an official statement on what's going on, but we can't comment on what's going on at this time.

740
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

741
00:46:59,401 --> 00:46:59,981
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's it.

742
00:47:01,102 --> 00:47:01,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

743
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else you want to ask us about?

744
00:47:03,684 --> 00:47:05,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for bringing that up.

745
00:47:08,956 --> 00:47:09,356
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

746
00:47:10,377 --> 00:47:12,237
[SPEAKER_07]: What'd you say, Mikotov?

747
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:17,259
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to ask him about how much he hates the stupid people in WoW, because he was complaining about it earlier.

748
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:18,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, you're in our WoW guild.

749
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,240
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on in WoW?

750
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:27,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just getting sick of all the stupid people who think that internet shorthand is okay in that fucking game.

751
00:47:28,003 --> 00:47:30,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's acceptable to a degree.

752
00:47:32,345 --> 00:47:34,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Like LOL and stuff like that?

753
00:47:35,726 --> 00:47:36,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

754
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:37,667
[SPEAKER_04]: For example...

755
00:47:39,853 --> 00:47:41,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't use the letter U to represent you.

756
00:47:42,295 --> 00:47:44,576
[SPEAKER_04]: It's two extra fucking letters you can type.

757
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:47,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Y-O-U.

758
00:47:47,418 --> 00:47:48,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus Christ.

759
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:56,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't there some type of add-on that you can get for World of Warcraft that will allow you to automatically, like, I remember Drew Nami was telling me about this once when he was here.

760
00:47:56,744 --> 00:48:03,728
[SPEAKER_07]: It was something about, like, I don't know, some filter that would automatically, like, change the letter U into Y-O-U, and it would change, like, a lot of the noob speak for you.

761
00:48:05,129 --> 00:48:06,250
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I need to find that.

762
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Drew Nami's in chat.

763
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,091
[SPEAKER_07]: He says it's called Eloquence.

764
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:09,409
[SPEAKER_04]: is what it's called.

765
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:16,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to pick that up because I don't mind typing out full words and full sentences, but I guess I'm the only person.

766
00:48:17,835 --> 00:48:21,277
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why you should just stay with your guild because we all type normally.

767
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:22,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my guild.

768
00:48:22,658 --> 00:48:23,398
[SPEAKER_04]: My guild's awesome.

769
00:48:23,739 --> 00:48:24,459
[SPEAKER_04]: We are awesome.

770
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:28,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And go vote for the songs for the STFU song tournament.

771
00:48:28,282 --> 00:48:29,322
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at the Sweet 16.

772
00:48:29,382 --> 00:48:31,664
[SPEAKER_04]: The big matchup right now is Colors vs. So Deep.

773
00:48:32,765 --> 00:48:33,305
[SPEAKER_11]: So Deep.

774
00:48:33,665 --> 00:48:34,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Go So Deep.

775
00:48:34,446 --> 00:48:36,267
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys should vote and

776
00:48:37,388 --> 00:48:39,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready, set, Rob's going to hang up on me.

777
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,311
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not.

778
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:43,513
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you very much for striking the nerve and allowing me to tease next week.

779
00:48:45,615 --> 00:48:45,995
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.

780
00:48:46,015 --> 00:48:46,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good weekend.

781
00:48:46,615 --> 00:48:47,216
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you too.

782
00:48:48,076 --> 00:48:48,497
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, bye.

783
00:48:48,697 --> 00:48:48,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

784
00:48:49,037 --> 00:48:49,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, DMN.

785
00:48:50,879 --> 00:48:55,002
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number.

786
00:48:55,482 --> 00:48:59,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can call us, username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

787
00:49:00,846 --> 00:49:02,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear we didn't pay him to call in and ask about that.

788
00:49:05,982 --> 00:49:06,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny you should mention that.

789
00:49:06,862 --> 00:49:08,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki and I were just talking about that before the show.

790
00:49:09,904 --> 00:49:10,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to another call.

791
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:12,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

792
00:49:12,305 --> 00:49:12,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

793
00:49:13,985 --> 00:49:16,046
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Legend of Zaku.

794
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:17,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Legend of Zaku.

795
00:49:18,007 --> 00:49:18,607
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

796
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:30,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, just chilling, nothing much, but I'm off the heels of a shitty tournament that I went to yesterday that I'm getting filmed for a DDR documentary.

797
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:33,133
[SPEAKER_07]: You went to a DDR tournament yesterday that was shitty.

798
00:49:33,193 --> 00:49:33,913
[SPEAKER_07]: What tournament was this?

799
00:49:34,926 --> 00:49:42,493
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one hour long island, far from where I live, but me and three other players from the city just went out there.

800
00:49:42,654 --> 00:49:43,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't they have pretty good transit, though?

801
00:49:43,995 --> 00:49:45,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you can take transit out.

802
00:49:45,837 --> 00:49:47,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we took the railroad.

803
00:49:47,678 --> 00:49:48,139
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

804
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:51,402
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have much better out there when it comes to transit than we do.

805
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:52,403
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of better out here.

806
00:49:53,384 --> 00:49:56,307
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the place we went to was really accessible.

807
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:04,767
[SPEAKER_00]: The only good thing about it was the documentary that two NYU students were filming on DDR players.

808
00:50:04,887 --> 00:50:05,788
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the documentary?

809
00:50:05,808 --> 00:50:07,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to be honest, though.

810
00:50:07,528 --> 00:50:09,789
[SPEAKER_07]: A DDR documentary does not strike me as anything new.

811
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,229
[SPEAKER_07]: What makes this one special?

812
00:50:12,249 --> 00:50:18,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, this NYU film student was just filming the four of us through the tournament.

813
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,642
[SPEAKER_00]: and just do our normal routines, just doing all the stupid things that we do.

814
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:34,004
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, we were actually interviewed.

815
00:50:34,204 --> 00:50:40,328
[SPEAKER_00]: We were asked questions about the basic stuff about how long we've been playing DDR, what got into it.

816
00:50:41,069 --> 00:50:47,312
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have other questions such as, how do you see yourself in the scene years from now?

817
00:50:47,853 --> 00:50:48,493
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of thing.

818
00:50:48,553 --> 00:50:50,034
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a future perspective.

819
00:50:51,438 --> 00:50:56,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I was once interviewed for one of these documentaries and I believe it was right when we'd started Orange Lounge.

820
00:50:56,381 --> 00:50:59,202
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about a year after we started, but I don't think these people knew about the radio stations.

821
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:06,106
[SPEAKER_07]: But I used to do freestyling under a pseudonym, Dr. Dick, and I just would get up on the machine and do an improv and just fuck off and I'd wear a funny hat.

822
00:51:06,573 --> 00:51:10,317
[SPEAKER_07]: and they wanted to interview me for this documentary and they wanted me to wear the funny hat and I said no.

823
00:51:10,577 --> 00:51:14,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I knew they would edit me to look like an idiot and I didn't want that.

824
00:51:15,982 --> 00:51:20,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so the documentary right now is still ongoing.

825
00:51:21,106 --> 00:51:30,815
[SPEAKER_00]: She plans on filming more tournaments in the next few weeks, especially some major ones, you know, some in the group 2 tournaments with R21.

826
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:37,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there's only the tip of the iceberg right now, so she has plenty of time to work on it.

827
00:51:37,638 --> 00:51:43,100
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a little bit more in-depth than just a one-time thing.

828
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:45,641
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

829
00:51:46,121 --> 00:51:49,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sorry to hear the tournament was not all that fun.

830
00:51:49,142 --> 00:51:53,983
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think a future tournament organizer should consider in planning a DDR tournament?

831
00:51:54,424 --> 00:51:55,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix the pads.

832
00:51:55,704 --> 00:51:57,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Needs better pads, period.

833
00:51:57,725 --> 00:52:01,606
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing that just killed it right there is just pads.

834
00:52:02,395 --> 00:52:02,835
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

835
00:52:02,855 --> 00:52:03,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, Zaku.

836
00:52:03,595 --> 00:52:04,556
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate the call.

837
00:52:04,576 --> 00:52:04,836
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

838
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:05,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Later.

839
00:52:05,696 --> 00:52:05,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Later.

840
00:52:06,096 --> 00:52:06,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

841
00:52:06,236 --> 00:52:06,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

842
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:06,756
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

843
00:52:06,776 --> 00:52:09,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to chat room and looking at comments while we wait for more phone calls.

844
00:52:09,777 --> 00:52:10,057
[SPEAKER_00]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

845
00:52:32,223 --> 00:52:34,804
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Dollar Bill says, Dr. Dick, that was you?

846
00:52:35,605 --> 00:52:38,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I didn't think there was anything on YouTube.

847
00:52:38,466 --> 00:52:40,647
[SPEAKER_07]: It was some freestyle video floating around for a little while.

848
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:41,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just dancing like an idiot.

849
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:42,668
[SPEAKER_07]: It was nothing serious.

850
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:43,449
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just silly.

851
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:45,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

852
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Blackboy, I guess I'm going to say this.

853
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:52,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Blackboy in chat says, so wait, IGN or GameSpot ripped off OLR's news and didn't credit them.

854
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:54,914
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's not what's going on.

855
00:52:55,074 --> 00:52:58,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we can't say too much yet because we're kind of...

856
00:52:59,728 --> 00:53:03,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Waiting to make an official thing, but we're not claiming that at all.

857
00:53:04,312 --> 00:53:13,119
[SPEAKER_07]: But what we will say is that it is interesting that other sites are reporting the exact same thing that we did, and other sites are continuing to run that information.

858
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:14,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And I suppose that's all we can say at this time.

859
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:15,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct?

860
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:16,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

861
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:17,462
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

862
00:53:17,502 --> 00:53:19,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Then let's go to another call, that being said.

863
00:53:21,626 --> 00:53:23,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

864
00:53:23,047 --> 00:53:23,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

865
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:24,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up, guys?

866
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:25,249
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Toshin.

867
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:26,590
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Toshin.

868
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:27,030
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

869
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:31,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to bring this all to a WoW tangent, but I gotta ask something, okay?

870
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:31,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

871
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:35,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, in the last couple weeks, you've said you've been playing WoW a lot, right?

872
00:53:35,814 --> 00:53:36,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

873
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:38,375
[SPEAKER_09]: How long have you been playing WoW?

874
00:53:39,956 --> 00:53:45,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, how many hours a week do I put in the game, or how long, like, have I been... Overall.

875
00:53:45,819 --> 00:53:46,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Overall?

876
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:52,183
[SPEAKER_07]: This recent round, I just started playing right when Burning Crusade came out about a week after, so January of this year.

877
00:53:52,603 --> 00:53:54,524
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've played on and off since...

878
00:53:55,396 --> 00:53:57,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh hell, I don't even remember when I made the first character.

879
00:53:57,958 --> 00:54:01,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably about a year ago, I want to say.

880
00:54:03,121 --> 00:54:04,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it a hard game to get into?

881
00:54:05,223 --> 00:54:11,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I must be the only one that I know, speaking for myself, that has never played a multiplayer RPG or anything like that.

882
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:13,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Mikotov wants to chime in.

883
00:54:13,248 --> 00:54:16,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you started playing it yet, or are you just thinking about it?

884
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:20,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, my friends, and I know a lot of people, including Rob, who have

885
00:54:21,169 --> 00:54:28,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played it a lot, somewhat, and I mean, I find it interesting and stuff, but I've just never come to, like, bring myself to invest the time in it.

886
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:31,754
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was just, is it like a hard thing to get into, or?

887
00:54:32,455 --> 00:54:36,417
[SPEAKER_11]: It really depends on, like, what class you play, what, um...

888
00:54:37,318 --> 00:54:39,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Blizzard has it set up really easy for you to take your first hit.

889
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:04,519
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

890
00:55:26,508 --> 00:55:29,589
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've never played an MMO before, it might be a little weird at first.

891
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:30,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'd be a total noob.

892
00:55:30,229 --> 00:55:31,130
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're a total noob.

893
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:40,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's cool, because you've called into this show enough before, and you've been in chat long enough, so that I know you're not a dumbass, and you speak intelligently when you type and everything.

894
00:55:40,573 --> 00:55:42,434
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't use the letter U for you and all that.

895
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:47,696
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think you're going to really have a problem fitting in, so to speak, into WoW.

896
00:55:48,356 --> 00:55:51,717
[SPEAKER_07]: But have you ever played Diablo or a game like it?

897
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:53,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I've fiddled with it.

898
00:55:54,288 --> 00:55:57,652
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend's like, here, take my map and run over to this spot on the map.

899
00:55:57,712 --> 00:55:59,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, what do I do if I run into something?

900
00:56:00,168 --> 00:56:01,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Click the mouse button or something like that.

901
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:04,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of getting into WoW, don't be afraid to die.

902
00:56:04,391 --> 00:56:06,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody dies the first couple times they play.

903
00:56:06,173 --> 00:56:10,216
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is not set up so that your character will get deleted forever if you die a few times.

904
00:56:10,276 --> 00:56:13,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Dying is kind of cool because it changes the way the game looks until you get to your body.

905
00:56:14,979 --> 00:56:15,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Die a lot.

906
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:20,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly found WoW a lot easier to get into than Final Fantasy XI.

907
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not trying to knock Final Fantasy XI.

908
00:56:21,724 --> 00:56:24,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I played it for a long time and I have some good memories from that game.

909
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,082
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

910
00:56:32,273 --> 00:56:33,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question for you guys.

911
00:56:33,794 --> 00:56:35,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys ever read the manual?

912
00:56:35,836 --> 00:56:36,336
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

913
00:56:36,797 --> 00:56:39,159
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like a really thick book that I definitely did not use.

914
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:40,480
[SPEAKER_07]: But I never read manuals to games.

915
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, nor do I. Actually, I'll take that back.

916
00:56:42,962 --> 00:56:46,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I cracked open Final Fantasy XI's manual because I got so frustrated that I didn't know how to do something.

917
00:56:47,005 --> 00:56:48,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally had to look it up how to do it.

918
00:56:48,607 --> 00:56:52,510
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I did too, but that was during the 13-hour install of the game.

919
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:53,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just like, I need something to do.

920
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:57,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see, I think if you're brand new to MMOs, it wouldn't hurt to...

921
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Toshin, I guess I end with this.

922
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:00,595
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got to lose?

923
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:25,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Your life, actually.

924
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:26,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Your real life.

925
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:31,492
[SPEAKER_07]: You can at least get the free trial to start it off, you know?

926
00:57:31,772 --> 00:57:33,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Join Ravencrest and we'll help you out.

927
00:57:33,293 --> 00:57:35,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Ravencrest Horde side and you can play with us and we're cool.

928
00:57:36,234 --> 00:57:36,934
[SPEAKER_09]: How long's the trial?

929
00:57:37,255 --> 00:57:37,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten days.

930
00:57:37,635 --> 00:57:38,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten days?

931
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:43,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough for you to take your first hit and decide if it's something you want to continue and then you can go from there.

932
00:57:43,477 --> 00:57:44,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's what, $12.95, $14.95 a month?

933
00:57:44,938 --> 00:57:47,539
[SPEAKER_11]: $14.95, but you get a limited character.

934
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:48,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how much Canadian?

935
00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:49,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Tosh is in Canada, so...

936
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:51,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

937
00:57:51,451 --> 00:57:51,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Who cares?

938
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:52,372
[SPEAKER_07]: A little more.

939
00:57:52,392 --> 00:57:52,852
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

940
00:57:52,892 --> 00:57:53,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

941
00:57:53,312 --> 00:57:54,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares, eh?

942
00:57:54,613 --> 00:57:55,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares, eh?

943
00:57:55,794 --> 00:57:56,094
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

944
00:57:57,115 --> 00:57:57,395
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

945
00:57:57,455 --> 00:58:00,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Toshin, we hope to see you online, but if not, you know.

946
00:58:00,998 --> 00:58:01,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in the chat room.

947
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:02,379
[SPEAKER_09]: You know where to find me.

948
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:02,719
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

949
00:58:02,739 --> 00:58:02,940
[SPEAKER_07]: We do.

950
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other thoughts or comments tonight?

951
00:58:07,103 --> 00:58:07,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

952
00:58:07,603 --> 00:58:11,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to just say, Travis, thanks for letting me win the game yesterday.

953
00:58:12,267 --> 00:58:12,707
[SPEAKER_07]: There you have it.

954
00:58:12,727 --> 00:58:14,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Travis Donovan live on Saturday nights.

955
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:17,951
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to know what the hell Toshin's talking about, you've got to download Saturday's archive, correct?

956
00:58:17,971 --> 00:58:18,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

957
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,260
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

958
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:19,600
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

959
00:58:50,186 --> 00:58:52,607
[SPEAKER_07]: You were in chat saying WoW can be played casually.

960
00:58:52,647 --> 00:58:53,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see you doing that.

961
00:58:53,247 --> 00:58:59,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody asked what's an MMO that can be played casually, and WoW has that rest bar feature that makes it very easy.

962
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:09,213
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I liked about WoW is that it has the rest bar so that the addicts get a little bit of a handicap, shall we say, amongst the folks who only can log in occasionally.

963
00:59:09,553 --> 00:59:14,314
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what's kept me afloat sometimes in that game because I just went four days without signing in.

964
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:15,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably have so much rest bar.

965
00:59:15,435 --> 00:59:16,055
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

966
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:21,440
[SPEAKER_11]: It also just depends on the MMO you pick if you really feel like you need to dedicate a lot of time to it.

967
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:25,621
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Final Fantasy XI casually, and that's not a casual game whatsoever.

968
00:59:25,801 --> 00:59:26,841
[SPEAKER_07]: One more call then, shall we?

969
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:27,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do another call.

970
00:59:27,661 --> 00:59:27,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

971
00:59:29,062 --> 00:59:29,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hi!

972
00:59:29,982 --> 00:59:30,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

973
00:59:30,622 --> 00:59:30,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it!

974
00:59:31,282 --> 00:59:32,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

975
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:32,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

976
00:59:33,522 --> 00:59:34,723
[SPEAKER_07]: One more thing, Raven's Dolphin.

977
00:59:35,763 --> 00:59:37,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how you've incorporated that into your name.

978
00:59:37,623 --> 00:59:39,384
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, one more thing, Raven's Dolphin?

979
00:59:41,024 --> 00:59:43,384
[SPEAKER_10]: The Sony PlayStation launch in Europe.

980
00:59:43,444 --> 00:59:44,725
[SPEAKER_10]: That's been on my mind for a while.

981
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:45,465
[SPEAKER_07]: How so?

982
00:59:45,505 --> 00:59:46,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Why has that been on your mind?

983
00:59:47,847 --> 00:59:48,687
[SPEAKER_07]: We got shot!

984
00:59:51,048 --> 00:59:51,788
[SPEAKER_07]: We got shot?

985
00:59:51,808 --> 00:59:53,929
[SPEAKER_07]: We as a collective people got shot.

986
00:59:55,529 --> 00:59:58,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you get shot looking for your PlayStation 3?

987
00:59:59,651 --> 01:00:00,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, I stood in my bunker.

988
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:01,852
[SPEAKER_10]: I was in my room.

989
01:00:01,952 --> 01:00:04,192
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

990
01:00:04,412 --> 01:00:07,153
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're saying you're surprised because we were all getting shot over it?

991
01:00:07,653 --> 01:00:08,074
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

992
01:00:09,154 --> 01:00:13,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony gave out TVs for the Europeans and I thought that was nice.

993
01:00:14,596 --> 01:00:15,536
[SPEAKER_10]: But they didn't do it for us.

994
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:18,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you think Sony kind of owed Europe something, though?

995
01:00:18,903 --> 01:00:20,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, sorry you had to wait six months.

996
01:00:21,324 --> 01:00:22,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, most definitely.

997
01:00:23,764 --> 01:00:32,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, what's interesting is that the first hundred folks got a TV, but the second hundred folks got flak jackets in case they got shot.

998
01:00:32,807 --> 01:00:35,108
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Sony is very nice over there in Europe.

999
01:00:35,728 --> 01:00:39,069
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a one also on the jokes.

1000
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:40,830
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I get for improvising here on the program.

1001
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:45,551
[SPEAKER_07]: What else is on your mind concerning this whole PlayStation 3 stuff, Raven's Dolphin?

1002
01:00:46,138 --> 01:00:47,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Two more things, Skye.

1003
01:00:47,539 --> 01:00:47,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1004
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:56,484
[SPEAKER_10]: How is that bad ability testing going at the Sony Corporation?

1005
01:00:57,285 --> 01:00:58,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I still stick to what I said.

1006
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:01,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki gave that joke a one.

1007
01:01:02,028 --> 01:01:06,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I still stick to what I said when that whole joke came up in the first place on All Games Interactive.

1008
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:12,514
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're buying a PlayStation 3 to play PlayStation 2 games, you are buying a PlayStation 3 for the wrong reasons.

1009
01:01:13,695 --> 01:01:14,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1010
01:01:14,536 --> 01:01:15,256
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a joke for you.

1011
01:01:16,209 --> 01:01:17,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Goodie, I can't wait for this.

1012
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:18,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what is that?

1013
01:01:18,851 --> 01:01:22,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, a man walked into a doctor's office wearing saran wrap.

1014
01:01:22,693 --> 01:01:23,113
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1015
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:25,134
[SPEAKER_10]: What did the doctor say?

1016
01:01:25,174 --> 01:01:25,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Let him finish!

1017
01:01:27,296 --> 01:01:28,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Raven Stolvin, what?

1018
01:01:29,717 --> 01:01:35,461
[SPEAKER_10]: A man walked into a doctor's office and he's dressed in saran wrap.

1019
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:37,222
[SPEAKER_10]: What did the doctor say?

1020
01:01:37,242 --> 01:01:43,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, why the fuck are you sitting in my office dressed in fucking saran wrap, you fucking freak?

1021
01:01:44,466 --> 01:01:45,667
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I see you're nuts.

1022
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:53,145
[SPEAKER_07]: One.

1023
01:01:53,486 --> 01:01:54,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be a little nicer.

1024
01:01:54,286 --> 01:01:55,627
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd give it a three, Raven Stolfen.

1025
01:01:56,548 --> 01:01:57,229
[SPEAKER_11]: A for effort.

1026
01:01:57,269 --> 01:01:58,950
[SPEAKER_11]: What's with the balls jokes?

1027
01:01:59,451 --> 01:02:02,093
[SPEAKER_11]: First it was Bill Cosby, and now it's just some random guy.

1028
01:02:02,433 --> 01:02:03,114
[SPEAKER_07]: They got the memo.

1029
01:02:03,134 --> 01:02:03,714
[SPEAKER_07]: You like balls.

1030
01:02:05,035 --> 01:02:05,275
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1031
01:02:05,315 --> 01:02:05,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1032
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:07,477
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Raven Stolfen, thanks for the call.

1033
01:02:07,497 --> 01:02:09,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Visit checkinggames.com.

1034
01:02:09,259 --> 01:02:09,919
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, bye.

1035
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:17,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

1036
01:02:17,745 --> 01:02:18,126
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

1037
01:02:18,326 --> 01:02:19,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a good way to end the calls for tonight.

1038
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:20,408
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?

1039
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:23,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I see you're nuts, Rice Princess!

1040
01:02:24,753 --> 01:02:26,434
[SPEAKER_07]: You're fucking nuts!

1041
01:02:29,597 --> 01:02:30,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it for the show?

1042
01:02:30,437 --> 01:02:32,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any other last-minute stories you came across, Loki?

1043
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:35,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one.

1044
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:36,402
[SPEAKER_07]: It's big.

1045
01:02:36,702 --> 01:02:39,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a big last-minute story for you guys.

1046
01:02:40,145 --> 01:02:49,152
[SPEAKER_07]: A little birdie has told me, and this is a rumor, but a little birdie told me that Paper Mario may be on its way to Virtual Console sooner than you think.

1047
01:02:49,824 --> 01:02:53,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Paper Mario's release may coincide with that.

1048
01:02:54,788 --> 01:02:57,691
[SPEAKER_07]: So stop booing Paper Mario, Miklatov.

1049
01:02:57,731 --> 01:02:58,471
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fine game.

1050
01:02:58,932 --> 01:02:59,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have it.

1051
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:01,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't count that game out just yet.

1052
01:03:01,974 --> 01:03:04,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that a GameCube title or is that a 64 title?

1053
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:10,201
[SPEAKER_07]: It was originally Nintendo 64, but I believe there was a paper... Yeah, there was the Thousand Year Door or whatever was on GameCube.

1054
01:03:10,222 --> 01:03:11,022
[SPEAKER_07]: But the original was Nintendo 64.

1055
01:03:11,082 --> 01:03:11,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, cool.

1056
01:03:12,423 --> 01:03:14,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I just got a good news story right here.

1057
01:03:14,525 --> 01:03:15,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, what's that?

1058
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:47,010
[SPEAKER_05]: in actual news though here's another rumor for you don't laugh it encourages her and this is going to be even more confusing but apparently according to was it the NGC magazine in the UK an article in there said there's no screenshots of it yet but the UK version of Pokemon Battle Revolution will not have the restrictions of the friend code system

1059
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:49,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1060
01:03:49,511 --> 01:03:50,431
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's confusing.

1061
01:03:51,872 --> 01:03:59,154
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in other words, Europe might not have to, because they don't have child molesters in Europe, I guess, they're not going to have to worry about friend codes, maybe.

1062
01:03:59,294 --> 01:03:59,594
[SPEAKER_05]: You hear that?

1063
01:03:59,614 --> 01:04:02,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe they're just, I don't know, a little laid back.

1064
01:04:02,094 --> 01:04:08,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody needs to look Reggie Fils-Aimé in the eye and go, friend codes, yes or no, I want a clear answer, don't BS me.

1065
01:04:09,256 --> 01:04:15,137
[SPEAKER_05]: What they should do is say, I will arm wrestle you, Reggie, and the winner decides the friend codes thing.

1066
01:04:15,337 --> 01:04:16,298
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it should be done.

1067
01:04:16,438 --> 01:04:17,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But Reggie would win.

1068
01:04:18,297 --> 01:04:18,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time.

1069
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:20,598
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to get someone stronger.

1070
01:04:21,598 --> 01:04:22,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get Chuck Norris.

1071
01:04:23,178 --> 01:04:24,058
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we need to do.

1072
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:25,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

1073
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:28,860
[SPEAKER_05]: What else?

1074
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:31,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

1075
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:37,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Three Speech, which I remember... A chatter sent me a story I need to read, but go ahead and do yours first.

1076
01:04:37,222 --> 01:04:42,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Three Speech is saying that there's more download content on the way.

1077
01:04:42,843 --> 01:04:46,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, if I remember correctly, that's the semi-official Sony blog...

1078
01:04:47,153 --> 01:04:55,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, Genji, Days of Blade, says more excitement will be coming, including new armor, I guess.

1079
01:04:57,279 --> 01:05:01,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and yeah, new armor for your four playable characters.

1080
01:05:02,782 --> 01:05:04,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't care, don't care.

1081
01:05:04,763 --> 01:05:08,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Ridge Racer 7, supposed to be getting some more decal packs.

1082
01:05:09,986 --> 01:05:12,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, so I guess that's neat.

1083
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:13,676
[SPEAKER_05]: and MotorStorm.

1084
01:05:13,736 --> 01:05:18,737
[SPEAKER_05]: It says any PS3 player playing MotorStorm Online will receive time trial mode automatically.

1085
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:22,738
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually, I think, was launched this week, so I know that's going into effect.

1086
01:05:22,758 --> 01:05:27,880
[SPEAKER_05]: There's supposed to be some new friend codes, or not friend code system, like a friends list system for that as well.

1087
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,901
[SPEAKER_05]: And Resistance Fallen Man, two new playable maps, Western Moreland and Kambor.

1088
01:05:34,721 --> 01:05:35,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are coming soon as well.

1089
01:05:35,722 --> 01:05:36,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I think those are coming in April.

1090
01:05:38,304 --> 01:05:40,505
[SPEAKER_07]: One of our users, Meklar, wanted me to share this with you.

1091
01:05:40,546 --> 01:05:41,466
[SPEAKER_07]: He sent me this in chat.

1092
01:05:41,506 --> 01:05:42,627
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a story from Kotaku.

1093
01:05:43,627 --> 01:05:48,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody named John, I guess who's a reader of the site, just got home from the launch at the Virgin Megastore in London.

1094
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:51,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, they were all given some chairs.

1095
01:05:51,112 --> 01:05:53,633
[SPEAKER_07]: There were some friendly folks on hand giving out some camping chairs.

1096
01:05:54,213 --> 01:05:57,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the back of the chairs, it said, shouldn't have kept you waiting.

1097
01:05:57,595 --> 01:06:01,978
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was www.shkyw.org.

1098
01:06:02,078 --> 01:06:03,679
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you visit the URL...

1099
01:06:05,137 --> 01:06:08,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox welcomes PlayStation 3 to the next generation.

1100
01:06:09,319 --> 01:06:10,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony, you're late.

1101
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:14,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the games begin.

1102
01:06:15,402 --> 01:06:17,362
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks to be just a big Microsoft ad here.

1103
01:06:17,382 --> 01:06:18,323
[SPEAKER_07]: There might be sound with this.

1104
01:06:18,363 --> 01:06:18,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm visiting.

1105
01:06:20,124 --> 01:06:22,004
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a little flash animation that goes on.

1106
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:24,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Xbox welcomes PlayStation 3 to the next generation.

1107
01:06:24,706 --> 01:06:28,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows if that was an official Microsoft-sanctioned thing, but that's pretty funny either way.

1108
01:06:28,647 --> 01:06:31,749
[SPEAKER_05]: They had barges and stuff there during the France launch as well.

1109
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:32,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1110
01:06:33,029 --> 01:06:33,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1111
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:34,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha, ha, ha.

1112
01:06:35,851 --> 01:06:36,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Cute!

1113
01:06:36,632 --> 01:06:37,472
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cute, Microsoft!

1114
01:06:37,532 --> 01:06:46,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there is a 2D version of Ocarina of Time being made by some guy, looks like, named Richard, and he's dead now from a car crash.

1115
01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:49,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So no 2D Ocarina of Time for you.

1116
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:54,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so glad Loki doesn't report the real news, because he would have no sensitivity whatsoever.

1117
01:06:54,424 --> 01:07:00,889
[SPEAKER_05]: In better news, though, Matrix is coming to HD, DVD, and Blu-ray, and that's awesome.

1118
01:07:01,269 --> 01:07:04,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I say I'm sorry to hear about the guy behind the project?

1119
01:07:04,872 --> 01:07:05,372
[SPEAKER_07]: That's too bad.

1120
01:07:06,052 --> 01:07:06,792
[SPEAKER_05]: VEHICULAR VEHICULAR VEHICULAR

1121
01:07:35,228 --> 01:07:35,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1122
01:07:38,089 --> 01:07:39,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we please end the damn show now?

1123
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:40,949
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

1124
01:07:40,989 --> 01:07:41,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Viscarole?

1125
01:07:41,949 --> 01:07:43,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Viscarole, whatever it was.

1126
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:51,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you're here to make the occasional fart joke and then tease me about mispronouncing words.

1127
01:07:51,392 --> 01:07:53,732
[SPEAKER_07]: What the fuck else did you contribute to tonight's show?

1128
01:07:55,552 --> 01:07:56,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesomeness?

1129
01:07:56,313 --> 01:07:56,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1130
01:07:58,873 --> 01:07:59,693
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I think so.

1131
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,100
[SPEAKER_07]: EarthDefenseForce2017 Team

1132
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I gotta wait until Super Paper Mario comes out before I get to play something new.

1133
01:08:36,882 --> 01:08:37,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do I?

1134
01:08:39,663 --> 01:08:41,724
[SPEAKER_07]: The hell's that supposed to mean, you smug little bastard?

1135
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:42,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you know what it means.

1136
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:43,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, alright, maybe.

1137
01:08:44,486 --> 01:08:52,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, and my final thought, thank you very much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting Independent Radio.

1138

[SPEAKER_07]: Please leave us a kind review on iTunes or tell a friend, if you tell two friends about Orange Lounge Radio, then we take over the world slowly but surely.

1140
01:09:02,175 --> 01:09:02,755
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it works.

1141
01:09:03,484 --> 01:09:06,005
[SPEAKER_07]: and Rice Princess's fart noises can spread throughout the world.

1142
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:06,926
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great thing.

1143
01:09:06,966 --> 01:09:07,326
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1144
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:09,628
[SPEAKER_07]: With her mouth, folks, not her butt.

1145
01:09:09,768 --> 01:09:10,248
[SPEAKER_07]: That's gross.

1146
01:09:10,848 --> 01:09:11,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great week.
