6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,940
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on March 25th, 2007.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,140
We tape Orange Lounge Radio in two parts.

00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,240

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,860
check our RSS feed for past shows and you can hear part A of this episode where we talked

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,360
about the launch of the PlayStation 3, we talked about the black Xbox 360, and so on.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,200
When I say launch of the PlayStation 3, I mean in Europe, of course.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Not here.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,880
That would be old news and we try to avoid old news if possible on this program.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,080
Dark Soccer is not here tonight and I was out of town for the past four days, so Lokiís

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,240
taken over the news tonight and I am simply commenting here with Rice Princess whoís

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,880
filled in tonight and is making the occasional comment while playing on the laptop.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
Mm-hmm.

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
All right.

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,880
Loki, take it away.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
All right.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,240
Well, this week we had some more news that wasnít really favorable for Sony and it was

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,260
more exclusives leaving Sony and going to the Xbox 360, not necessarily being exclusive

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,360
for the 360 but for now for both systems.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,840
So for example, the first title and actually big one, Devil May Cry 4, has been confirmed

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:29,440
to be on the Xbox 360 and the PSP, or not PSP, PC, and that is confirmed according to

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,120
Capcom Japan.

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,580
So that sucks.

28
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:42,800
And according to Xbox product manager of Microsoft Germany, Boris Schneider, Schneider John,

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,400
I guess, hyphen in the name, Devil May Cry is only the first.

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:56,200
There will be three exclusives total that are coming to the Xbox 360 and according to

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,120
that I believe it was Final Fantasy 13 and Metal Gear Solid 4, the other two.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,720
Boy, that would be a one, two, three knockout.

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:11,200
I mean honestly, Final Fantasy 13 for me is kind of one of the few things that Sony seems

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,920
to be hanging on with right now because Xbox 360 kind of lacks really solid role playing,

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,760
next gen role playing games right now, I mean sure you've got Enchanted Arm but that is,

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,520
while it wasn't a bad game, it wasn't a OMG memorable, wonderful forever title and although

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,880
Final Fantasy 13 may indeed suck, it is a Final Fantasy game, there's going to be people

38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
lined up for it.

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,560
Now, to be fair though, this was in his blog post because I guess everybody keeps blogs

40
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
nowadays.

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,160
Oh sorry, chat room says Blue Dragon, yeah true, you got me there.

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,720
And to be honest though, these are just kind of a shopping, a personal shopping list, it's

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,600
not necessarily anything confirmed, this is just a rumor for now, but Devil May Cry 4

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,480
is definitely, that's going to hurt and to be honest though, you kind of have to be stupid

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,240
unless there's a lot of money on the table to release something just on Playstation 3,

46
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,760
I mean especially if you're looking to sell lots of copies of it, there's just not that

47
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,680
many units out there.

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,360
For now, but we don't know what Sony might have in the pipeline.

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,680
For now, and there's companies that are doing that, I mean look at Ubisoft for example,

50
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,640
how long has Rainbow Six Vegas for the Playstation 3 been delayed?

51
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,060
A long time, it originally was supposed to be coming out at launch, and then it was delayed

52
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:36,400
to January, then February, then March, now I think April and possibly May, I mean that's

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,720
yeah, they're really pushing it along until there's enough units out there and it will

54
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,760
keep moving until Christmas if it has to.

55
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,720
Can I be honest for a minute though, you know how sometimes folks assume because we do this

56
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,860
podcast in our spare time and everything that we play every single game that's out there

57
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,280
and stuff, but that's not true, we don't have time to play everything, I'm going to be honest,

58
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,980
Devil May Cry is one of those series I never have played.

59
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,500
As much as I would like, it looks fun, it looks interesting, I just have never really

60
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,680
sat down and played it.

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,800
So to me, this news just kind of made me go, meh, that sucks for Sony, but that was pretty

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,640
much all I said, I wasn't really like, oh my god, you know this whole thing because

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm not super into Devil May Cry because again, it's one of those series I just haven't had

64
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,120
a chance to get into.

65
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,880
If they lose Final Fantasy 13, that's going to be fun.

66
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,400
For me, that's a big deal because Metal Gear Solid, I am not that into that series as I

67
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,400
am Final Fantasy, if Final Fantasy 13 is lost to the Xbox 360, I have zero reason to get

68
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
a Playstation 3.

69
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Honestly.

70
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,360
Um, my thinking though in this, and this is just kind of going back to what they did with

71
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,880
the Final Fantasy 7 series, is that they're going to release a version on Playstation

72
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,520
3 and they're going to release a different version on the Xbox 360, and then they're

73
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,600
going to have something else on the PSP, and then they're going to have something else

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
on the DS.

75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,960
You know, they kind of do these ten title releases for one game type of thing, you know,

76
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,920
like they did with Final Fantasy 7, how uber ridiculous that was, so, I don't know.

77
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
We'll have to see.

78
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,080
And the game could suck.

79
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,080
I don't know.

80
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Yeah.

81
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,520
I mean, look at Dirge of Service, perfect example.

82
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,440
So right now.

83
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,440
James Patrick is in our chat right now and makes a few comments.

84
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,600
Currently, by the way, chat.orangeonsrated.com, currently 360 has more JRPG's coming than

85
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,840
Playstation 3 because of the whole Mistwalker alignment.

86
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,240
Um, okay, I guess I could give that, although I don't, well Sony does have again the track

87
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
record.

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,640
That's kind of what I'm looking at right now with Playstation 2 and Xbox, and maybe that's

89
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,800
not a fair comparison, but you kind of think that okay, well if it was that way before,

90
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,120
but I get what you're saying, you know, they didn't have Mistwalker last time, and that's

91
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,640
a pretty big something something, I'll give you that.

92
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,280
Give me a break for forgetting Blue Dragon, I've been out of town the past four days.

93
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,360
I'm going to keep using that as my excuse as much as I can.

94
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,440
James Patrick says, also Final Fantasy 13 uses the white engine, Unreal Engine 3 is

95
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,240
being used for something they haven't announced.

96
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,720
But I would bet it's a spinoff.

97
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,840
There is something else, they are going to be announcing something new during that May

98
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,560
Final Fantasy party or whatever, so.

99
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Interesting.

100
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,080
Jumpman says maybe Kingdom Hearts 3 for Unreal, I don't know.

101
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,720
Or how about a new series out of Squeenix, I mean it wouldn't kill them to come up with

102
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,560
a new series, would it?

103
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
True.

104
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
However though, fear not Sony, because not all is lost.

105
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,800
In fact, you may remember, I don't know, a while ago there was a partnership between

106
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:37,080
Namco Bandai and Sony called Celis, or Celius I guess, and it's a brand new partnership

107
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,960
that they are creating some brand new games, including three games that have been announced

108
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,680
so far and actually they showed up in Famitsu Magazine.

109
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,720
Brave Arms, which appears to be like a third person action game, kind of like Ninja Gaiden.

110
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,560
There was another game called Chain Limit, which is kind of a James Bond or Jack Bauer

111
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,280
style spy adventure game, and second season one, which is a first person drama sci-fi

112
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,840
action title.

113
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,440
And I gotta say from looking at the screenshots of it in Famitsu Magazine, those look damn

114
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,520
good.

115
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,500
So way to go, I mean that's some good stuff right there, you know, they just need to have

116
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,620
some more exclusive titles to them that look really nice, and you know, people will be

117
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,620
all over that stuff.

118
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,520
I mean, they look really nice.

119
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,200
I can't wait for these games to come out.

120
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,360
Anyways, so kind of moving along here, we've got some other interesting stuff.

121
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,840
More upcoming games, not necessarily for the Playstation 3.

122
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,120
Thing we talked about last week, Knights, which is rumored to be coming to the Wii and

123
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:51,960
pretty much confirmed in the official Nintendo Magazine in the UK and other sources.

124
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,040
But anyways, in other words, it's coming out, and if you think so at this point that it's

125
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,320
not, you're an idiot, or you're the biggest conspiracy theorist in the world.

126
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
It is coming out.

127
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Yes.

128
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Period.

129
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,960
One person though that's not really interested in the new Knights game is Yuji Naka.

130
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:14,760
And you know, basically saying that at the present, I have no such intentions to create

131
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:20,000
another game in the franchise, so much like Katamari, it will probably live on without

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,400
him.

133
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,840
Bull deal.

134
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,240
Let's see.

135
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,720
Moving along though.

136
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,320
Another game that's been in development forever.

137
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Duke Nukem Forever?

138
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Yes.

139
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
Oh wow, I'm good.

140
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,800
I didn't even peek, I promised I didn't peek over Loki's shoulder, I just kind of guessed.

141
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,920
It's still plugging away, and basically 3D Realms admits to screwing up and promises

142
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,840
that the new Duke Nukem game will be multi-platform, and hopefully will be out soon.

143
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Other info...

144
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Wasn't there some type of promise it was going to be out before the end of the year?

145
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
I still remember.

146
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Was it last year?

147
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
I don't know.

148
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
Ah, fuck it.

149
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,440
I don't even listen to them anymore.

150
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,960
Some other interesting stuff though, it's rumored that the composer for Elder Scrolls

151
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,920
Oblivion has jumped on board to score Duke Nukem Forever, and a couple of things hinting

152
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
to that.

153
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,880
The first developer, Raphael van Lietrop, it looks like, discussed in his blog about

154
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,480
a recent visit from Julian Soule, the guy who did the score.

155
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,520
Also an insider's only interview at IGN, Jeremy left one hint about his secretive upcoming

156
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,640
project.

157
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,920
He said, when it's done.

158
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
That was another quote that they had for Duke Nukem Forever.

159
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,640
Let's see if we can get him on the show, because we had some guy from that site where they

160
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,940
sell his music previously on the program, and we were going to try and get an interview

161
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,940
with that guy.

162
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,160
Maybe we can try and beat him down for the details.

163
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,960
These are excellent composers.

164
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,520
Like Oblivion had some incredible music, and as did Prey, he did the music for that as

165
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
well.

166
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,880
Prey had some pretty awesome songs in it, but also Guild Wars has a really great soundtrack

167
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,160
if you've ever listened to it, and he did that as well.

168
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,900
That's pretty exciting if he's doing Duke Nukem Forever, but Oblivion and Guild Wars

169
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,720
are very medieval type, have a certain sound to them.

170
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,080
I would see Duke Nukem Forever's score sounding a little more like the Prey, but it could

171
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
be interesting.

172
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
It could be interesting.

173
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
He's a talented guy.

174
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,640
Well, since we're talking about stuff coming out, might as well start talking about what's

175
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,680
coming out this week, and I'm going to start off here real quick with what's coming out

176
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,080
in the UK, and you have lots of stuff this week, of course, with the PlayStation 3 launch

177
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,580
and whatnot, but now though we've got some good stuff coming out for you, including we've

178
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:46,120
got this week Gran Turismo 4 Mobile, although I would believe that when I see it, because

179
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,600
I haven't heard anything about that.

180
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm not sure if I'll believe that, but God of War 2 is going to be coming out on PlayStation

181
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,420
2, FEAR is coming out on PlayStation 3 for you guys, and I know that game has been delayed

182
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,420
forever over here.

183
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,420
Oh, I'm sorry, you're doing the Euro date, never mind.

184
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,640
I was like, didn't God of War 2 already come out over here?

185
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,160
Yes, it did.

186
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Just kidding!

187
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,800
300 March of Glory is finally making its way out to the PSP, After Burner Black Falcon

188
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,080
is also coming out, Bionicle Heroes for the Wii being put out by Eidos as well, Call of

189
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:25,920
Duty Roads to Victory for the PSP, Command & Conquer 3 Tiberian Wars for the PC, and

190
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,240
Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 coming out for the Wii, so that's a pretty cool lineup,

191
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,000
also I guess looks like a heat seeker on the Wii and the PSP, hopefully that stuff comes

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
out here pretty soon, and Medal of Honor Vanguard on the Wii and PlayStation 2 will be out this

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,480
week, as well as Test Drive Unlimited, and looks like Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell double

194
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,140
agent as well on the PlayStation 3.

195
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:56,240
For the US, we've got some good stuff coming out, of course this week, not a whole lot,

196
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,700
got a few movie tie-ins, like for example, Meet the Robinsons got some games coming out

197
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,480
for that, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox 360, the Wii, the DS, the Game Boy Advance, and

198
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:15,080
PSP, so, you know, lots of systems for that game, and of course on PlayStation 2 and the

199
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,740
Wii we have Medal of Honor Vanguard, which is going to be coming out, Metal Slug Anthology

200
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,000
is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, hopefully this week, because it's been delayed

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,520
a lot, let's see here, on the PlayStation 3, Splinter Cell double agent, so that should

202
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:41,760
be coming out this week, on PC, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, the expansion to that, Shivering

203
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,520
Isles, yes, that should be making its way on PC, we can actually buy that and then downloadable

204
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,240
on the Xbox 360, fucking need to play more Oblivion, I really do, it was so incredible,

205
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,280
I need to spend a hundred hours to just explore every nook and cranny, if you happen to be

206
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,480
in the mood for some really weird PC titles, I've got a couple titles, I think these have

207
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,160
to be my favorites for the week, Super Granny 3, on the PC, Rad, what are you doing Super

208
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:18,680
Granny 3, I'm not sure, but it looks pretty awesome, apparently, Guild 3, Super Granny

209
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,480
3, but that's still not my favorite title, my favorite title has to be this, Alien Disco

210
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,760
Safari, that one is, that has to be my favorite title of the week, and that's going to be

211
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:37,680
coming out, no idea, but maybe we'll see Super Granny 4 meets the Alien Disco Safari, Granny's

212
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,920
Alien Disco Safari 4, yeah, maybe, winner, Cabela's Alien Disco Safari, alright, well

213
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,760
I haven't been good for much this week, but at least maybe I can get out some Japanese

214
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,600
release dates, would that be ok? Would you have any exclusives, by the way, I didn't

215
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,840
hear any of the good stuff. You didn't really have too much to announce, of course, not

216
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,560
a big surprise, I think this has been announced originally, they said they were doing Guitar

217
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,200
Hero 80's edition or something, yeah, that was no surprise, you landed a date, but it

218
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,720
was weird, we got linked from some punk rock music news site, linked that, a lot of folks

219
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,840
kind of forgot that they've already said they're doing an 80's edition or they've hinted at

220
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:21,280
it, so a lot of folks are taking that as news for the first time. Yeah, this stuff is nothing

221
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,920
new, I just thought I'd point it out because everyone's got a big boner over Guitar Hero,

222
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,760
especially with the new game coming out next week, so that's going to be big, I don't know,

223
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,440
looking forward to more Guitar Hero, they're definitely keeping up with their promise with

224
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,160
releasing multiple releases throughout the week, they're not the only franchise that's

225
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,080
promised to do that, we'll get into that a little bit later. Japanese release dates,

226
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,640
before I get into those, looking at the chat room here, let's see, Mecklar says Super Granny

227
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,480
3, you have to save cats, that could be a joke, I don't know, and then Shadow Next Gen

228
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,020
says Shivering Isles is coming out the day Xbox Live is down, lol, and Joshi16 follows

229
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,360
up with that, it's only down for 14 hours, it's official, but don't those things usually

230
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,920
take longer than they say they do? Yeah, apparently it's not for anything specific, they said

231
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,080
they had a lot of work to do on the back end, so they're kind of doing that right now. Going

232
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,680
back in chat to the Duke Nukem Forever chat, the Rob D from This Day in Gaming says I like

233
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,960
how the creators of DNF, Duke Nukem Forever, actually take responsibility for screwing

234
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:33,200
it up, they have no excuses, just we screwed up. Dark Sakura made a cameo on This Day in

235
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:40,000
Gaming this week, by the way, check that out, it's hilarious. Japanese release dates, Xbox

236
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,560
360 gets Absolute Blazing Infinity, Call of Duty 3, and Asia gets the release of Rayman

237
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:56,020
Raving Rabbids all on the 29th of March. Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Mizase Suri Master

238
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,400
is coming out from Hudson for the Nintendo Wii, and this looks to be some type of sports

239
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,540
title that's coming out, it looks like it involves fishing, and hasn't this been announced

240
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,120
for the US as some other name? Because it's all fishing, is what it is, some type of fishing

241
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,720
game. I saw some screenshots for this. Maybe. Maybe somebody in chat room would know more

242
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,880
information about that whole thing. Let's see, also coming out on the, well that's it.

243
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,040
You can get some controller covers and stuff for like 5 bucks, 10 bucks on Nintendo Wii.

244
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,760
I don't know if Rayman Raving Rabbids is coming out, because that's another game that they

245
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,720
kind of delayed, it was very last minute too, it was supposed to be coming out this week,

246
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,840
and then got moved to May. For the 360. For the 360. I don't know, we'll see. Coming out

247
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,440
on the Playstation 3, Winning Post 7 Maximum 2007 on the 29th of March for the Playstation

248
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,800
3, that's a horsey racing game. Enjoy your horsey racing if you are into that. Coming

249
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,380
out over on the Playstation 2, Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix, I know a lot of folks are very

250
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:06,280
excited about that. Vitamin X. I like the name of this game. Vitamin X is coming out.

251
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,680
There's also a limited edition available. I'm not sure if this is based on an anime

252
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,480
or what, because I haven't been keeping tabs on my anime, but it's certainly got one of

253
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,680
those covers. Rice Princess, you know a lot about anime. Is Vitamin X an anime? I've never

254
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,560
heard of it. I think so. Vitamin X? I don't know, it's got a little cover there. It's

255
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,040
an action game. It's not ringing a bell for me. Maybe somebody in chat knows. Couldn't

256
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,440
tell you that one there. But also, this other one, this sounds like a very interesting game

257
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,300
coming out in Japan. Gaokan Utopia, Manabe Straight, Kira Kira Happy Festa is coming

258
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,440
out. And this is an adventure game with a bunch of girly anime characters on the cover.

259
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,760
Looks like a chibi punch and kick game. But it has a cute name. Yay. So, have fun with

260
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,000
that. Let's see if anything else is coming out on the other systems. Oh, Nintendo DS,

261
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,360
Digimon. Two Digimon games coming out from Bandai. Moonlight and Sunburst. It doesn't

262
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,560
really say what Vitamin X is, but it says it's a love adventure game by D3. Oh, a love

263
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,240
adventure game, huh? Does that mean it's like a dating sim? I don't know. Maybe. We'll see.

264
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,100
That's pretty much all I got for you guys over in Japan. Have fun with your chibi girly

265
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,480
fighting game. Well, the U.S. is going to see something else coming soon to your local

266
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:26,840
video store, I guess. Blu-ray release of the classic video game and arcade classic, Dragon's

267
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Lair will be coming out soon. And not really a big surprise because it's been out on DVD

268
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:38,280
for a while now. And they expect that it's going to be on HD DVD at some point and it's

269
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,960
going to be sold for $49.95. Yikes. That's quite expensive. I don't know how you could

270
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,400
really, well, I don't know. I thought the graphics were probably as good as you can

271
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,080
get on Dragon's Lair. They can't really enhance it anymore. It seems a little bit pointless

272
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:01,760
to me. I mean, you know, Dragon's Lair has kind of already been done, you know, on DVD

273
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,400
and that's about as good. I mean, the original was on LaserDisc and it wasn't that pretty.

274
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,200
I mean, did they clean it up? Did they do anything to it? Not that I can see. Interesting.

275
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:20,960
Well, there you have it. Is Dragon's Lair a reason to buy a $600 PlayStation 3? No. Yes,

276
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,160
says Miklotov. Miklotov's just fucking with us. He's just kidding. Now release Super Granny

277
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,900
3 on Blu-ray and we're talking. Or Ultimate Duck Hunter from the bonus segment tonight

278
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,520
or whatever the fuck that game was. Ultimate Duck Hunting. Ultimate Duck Hunting. You'll

279
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:42,080
either kill the ducks or they will kill you. That's right. Wouldn't that be funny if like

280
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,800
Ultimate Duck Hunting like kind of was a little bit like Donnie Darko or something like that,

281
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:53,720
you know, where it's like a lot of head games and stuff. That would be awesome. And it has

282
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,680
what? What did you say about Jake Gyllenhaal over there? I'm sorry. I'm having private

283
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,900
message chat with other people in our channel. Well, he was saying something about Donnie

284
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,120
Darko and I said some other words and then I said Jake Gyllenhaal because he's in it

285
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,320
and he's hot. He totally is. I should totally option Ultimate Duck Hunting for a movie.

286
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,920
I bet they'd sell the rights pretty cheap. You never know. Anyways, so speaking of stuff

287
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,160
that's been delayed, Calling All Cars, brand new game that's supposed to be coming out

288
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,840
to the Playstation Network. It's going to be one of their downloadable games. It's been

289
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:35,480
moved to April and this is done by the same guy that did God of War, David Jeff. Basically,

290
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,380
I don't know, he's just hit a roadblock, you know, as far as putting it out on the Playstation

291
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,240
Network. Never really given any reasons why. He did have some gameplay footage of it and

292
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,840
it did look all that pretty. And he said though, I mean, he's not trying to compete with like

293
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,920
a Halo or anything or even God of War with us. I'm still saying it looks like crap. And

294
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,680
he says it's all about the fun factor. It did not look fun at all. It looked pretty

295
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:07,600
boring. So, hopefully I'm wrong and it'll come out to be pretty fun. I don't know. We'll

296
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,840
have to see. Hopefully they release a demo. Another game that's getting yet another release,

297
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,640
especially next week, they have Sing Star Pop coming out over here. Well, that's not

298
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,320
all. They're going to be seeing six Sing Stars come out by next year.

299
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,600
Oh, nice. On Playstation 2 or Mix?

300
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,360
Think both because I know Playstation 3 is getting Sing Star coming out in June.

301
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,240
But wasn't Playstation 3 only supposed to get like one Sing Star and that's it? And

302
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,880
then they download everything with that?

303
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,560
Well, I think so. I mean, but then again, I mean, you never know. Remember originally

304
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,200
Karaoke Revolution was going to have add ons to it and that never happened. They figured

305
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,180
out, Hey, we got like a couple packs here, a couple packs there. We can sell whole games

306
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:53,560
and make more money. So yeah, that's scary. And I'm not playing any of them.

307
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,540
Yeah. Act Deft was asking in chat the ultimate question. Will Loki buy it?

308
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,540
I will not touch it.

309
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,540
And will we put it on YouTube?

310
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,000
No, I will not touch this game. Even if I get it free, I will be burning it. Yeah. It's

311
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,320
a horrible, horrible, horrible game. Karaoke is awful. Now, of course, you know, stuff

312
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,960
being delayed and stuff. We've been delaying the mailbag for a while. So Rob, why don't

313
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,000
you make yourself useful and take Jamie's job, put on the gloves and dive into the mailbag.

314
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,840
Sure. Why not? It's the least I could do for my dear friend Loki.

315
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,860
Mailbag orange lounge trader.com. If you'd like to send us an email, I just randomly

316
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,620
picked a few emails for this week. So I apologize if I didn't get to you tonight, you'll just

317
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,520
have to deal with that rejection. Let's start with an email from Meglar who writes to say,

318
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,740
just a quick email to say you rock. And a quick little tidbit. I heard from a friend

319
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,340
who recently left the employment of Sega Knights is coming to the Wii, but also seems to be

320
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,780
heading to the PlayStation three and Xbox three 62. Seems to her the game now plays

321
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,900
like, Oh God, he just gave away who it is. I mean, how many female employees have just

322
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,620
recently left Sega? I don't know. Seems to her the game now plays like the magic carpet

323
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,800
from Sonic and the secret rings. Either way, it's something I'd not heard before. How about

324
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,580
you guys and gal? Definitely. I knew about the Wii through something similar, like a

325
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:23,860
friend of a friend at Sega, but I did not hear of PlayStation three and Xbox three 60.

326
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,260
Very interesting. If true, it makes sense though. It does make sense. I mean, you know,

327
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,500
Sega Knights is one of those franchises. I think people have been wanting to see come

328
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:37,300
back for awhile. So very interesting. I want new rez. Me too, but too bad it's a different

329
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:42,540
company altogether. Well, thank you for the email. Uh, we have an email from, uh, Sakura

330
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:49,500
max says, dear OLR first order of business, Rob, don't be such a tit. Stop the accent.

331
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,180
You disgrace my friends. Somebody is taking issue to my British accent. I do hit on the

332
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:59,380
program. Sometimes don't be such a tit about it. Just teasing. I guess part of the charm

333
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,020
is that my accents are so horrible. I don't know what else to tell you. Uh, second order

334
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,420
of business, Jamie, the reason I say Rondo of blood sucks is because it's on PSP. One

335
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:13,100
of the consoles I don't own and I've lost my loyalty to Sony. I don't know though with

336
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,820
it, with some of these big games, it seems like they're trying to woo some people back

337
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:21,580
to PSP. Is it too little too late? Yes. You think so? I was there a story this week and

338
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,380
I don't know if it's something upcoming. Forgive me, but I want to say I read something on

339
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,020
the internet before I left for my trip that said that retailers getting pissed that Sony

340
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,760
will not do a price cut on the PSP and some are threatening to, to just get the damn thing

341
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,460
off their shelves. Yeah. I was at the PlayStation, um, or destination PlayStation show. Apparently

342
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:43,220
they were demanding that the price be, uh, lowered for the system. I did see though what

343
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,940
they were, the GameStop was doing a special this week. They had, uh, the, was it the,

344
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,580
they had like a bundle pack a long time ago. Remember when the PlayStation or portable

345
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,460
first came out where it had like the case and the memory stick and stuff like that.

346
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Apparently now they don't have that. The core system is just PSP charger done, you know,

347
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,180
so now, um, they were offering that one at $1.99 cause originally it was $2.50. So there

348
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,460
was kind of a markdown, but yeah, well I think they're, they're probably going to redesign

349
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:19,620
it or something. So get people to buy it again. All right, well there you go. Uh, sorry. Dark

350
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,780
Soccer was not here tonight to respond to your comment, but if we remember, we'll tell

351
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,900
her next week. Uh, third order of business. I just got DDR Supernova in my arcade. Congratulations

352
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,620
on being about six months late to that party. Just kidding. Fourth order of business. DDR

353
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:38,020
Supernova might not be too good considering the fact that the first one wasn't too successful.

354
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:43,740
I'm not, I'm not, yeah, I don't sure I understand that statement because what, what first one

355
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,720
are we basing it off of? Oh, do we mean like DDR Supernova at home? Assuming there's going

356
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,900
to be a second mix this year, which I can't possibly see how there wouldn't be one. DDR

357
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,540
Supernova, um, still one of the top selling titles actually out there. I'm surprised every

358
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,820
time I see that too. Well, there you have it. I'm not, it's a very, it's, it's not something

359
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,320
the hardcore players go for, but for the family game, like when mom and dad are looking for

360
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,840
a game to buy the young kids for their birthday, I'm sure DDR jumps out, jumps off shelves

361
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,380
for that reason. Yeah, we think he means Supernova 2 arcade. He just left a two off there. So

362
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,680
whatever. Uh, Sakura Max is the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old and signs that email

363
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,500
and says PS desk cap. I don't know. That's, that's what he says in his email. He says

364
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,500
the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old. Do your parents know you listen to this? Shame

365
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,500
on you. That, uh, closing statement right there just makes you realize why 12 year olds

366
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:48,260
shouldn't be on the internet. Ouch. All right. Wow. You're so awesome. Totally awesome. Um,

367
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,780
more emails. We have a email from, I, uh, I horribly apologize if I'm mispronouncing

368
00:26:53,780 --> 00:27:00,780
his name. Nate and a I F could be knife. Nate, I think it's Nate. Uh, Hey guys, I really

369
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:05,020
love your show and I think it's one of the best shows on the web dealing with video games.

370
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,820
This week you asked us to send you our favorite jokes. Well, this is my all time favorite

371
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,300
joke because remember last week we had the email. I completely forgot about last week.

372
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,460
Well, here we go. We got a, we got a joke back. So we do remember we said voicemail,

373
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,020
not email, but well, that's all right. We'll take it cause I don't think we got really

374
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:26,740
any voicemails. So I don't know. I didn't check again. I've been kind of gone. Uh, so

375
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,700
here we go. Uh, I know it's an old one, but every time I tell it to my friends, they really

376
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,380
enjoy it. And I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did. So we'll, we'll, uh, rice princess

377
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:40,460
and a Loki and Michael top will be our judges on how funny this joke is. It's like American

378
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,780
idol for jokes. That'd be funny. Something like that. Although I kind of feel like we

379
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,940
should have like some music that plays with this or something. So maybe we should have

380
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,920
some joke telling music while we read the rest of this email. I'm going to play some

381
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,920
joke telling music. You ready? One day the teacher walks into her classroom and announces

382
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,800
to the class that on each Friday she will ask a question to the class. And anyone who

383
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,040
answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the following Monday. On the first Friday,

384
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,440
the teacher asks, how many grains of sand are in the beach? Needless to say, no one

385
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,440
could answer the following Friday. The teacher asks the class, how many stars are in the

386
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:22,440
sky? And again, no one could answer frustrated. Little Johnny decides that the next Friday,

387
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,440
he would somehow answer the question and get a three day weekend. So Thursday, Friday,

388
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,880
Thursday, Thursday night, Johnny takes two ping pong balls and paints them black. The

389
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,880
next day he brings them to school in a paper bag. At the end of the day, just when the

390
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,640
teacher says, here's this week's question, Johnny empties the bag to the floor, sending

391
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,120
the ping pong balls rolling to the front of the room because they are young kids who find

392
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:52,160
any disruption of class amusing. The entire class starts laughing. The teacher says, okay,

393
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:58,920
who's the comedian with the black balls? Immediately, Little Johnny stands up and says, Bill Cosby,

394
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:05,780
see you on Tuesday. That's pretty funny. I got one laugh in the room, a little chuckle

395
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,520
from Loki. Bacon. Are you laughing at the bacon or are you laughing at the joke? Joke.

396
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,240
All right. Let's go around and judge that scale on one to ten. It'll be like the gong

397
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,960
show here. Are we going to gong the joke? Rice Princess, on a scale of one to ten, how

398
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:27,080
was the joke? W. W? Yeah. Okay. Loki, on a scale of one to ten, how was that joke? It

399
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,440
would be like a seven. It's definitely no intelligent joke. I haven't heard it before,

400
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:40,600
so props for that. All right. And Mikolaj. One. All right. Why such a low score? Because

401
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,920
talking about Bill Cosby's balls is never a good thing and it's not funny. It's gross.

402
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,960
There you go. All right. Do you think this is going to encourage people to send us more

403
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,800
jokes? I have no idea. Ten for the bacon. All right. See, we all laughed at that. That

404
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:03,200
joke got a ten. Good job, Loki. See, none of you comedians will ever be as good as Loki.

405
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,480
Last email this week from our friend, DNL, also known as Renee. She's been on this show

406
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,040
before, but it's been a long time since she's been on the program. I know Renee is great.

407
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,120
Hi, OLR. This is DNL. I currently work at Perpetual Entertainment as an associate producer.

408
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,840
As you guys liked MMORPGs, I thought you might be interested in the game I'm working on called

409
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,080
Gods and Heroes Rome Rising. A brief description of our game is a massively multiplayer online

410
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,180
role playing game set to Roman mythology. Excuse me. I have the hiccups during this poor

411
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:34,360
email. Some key features is being able to play your hero character however you like

412
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,080
with six different classes and an extensive character customization. You also get to control

413
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,160
up to eight minions at a time, as well as have a visceral experience. I like DNL's use

414
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,520
of vis, where is there? Visceral? What's visceral? I don't know. I'm probably pronouncing

415
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,520
you wrong. What do you mean, visceral? Visceral. Yeah, sure. Visceral experience. Visceral.

416
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:03,800
Ten. I hate you all. This is Dark Sakura, never leave me again. With paired combat animation.

417
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,400
If interested, please sign up in our very active forums at community.godsandheroes.com.

418
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,960
Seven pointy things DNL. So I like how DNL is using our mailbag to spam her game, but

419
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,960
we'll give her that right here. In fact, why doesn't DNL get us an interview with peoples

420
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,900
from the game? We'll take them. Now if I can do anything and I can control up to eight

421
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:28,020
minions, can I like sit back and like drink ale and have my minions like kill things while

422
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,880
I just sit there and not do anything? Do I get level, you know, experience points for

423
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:38,480
that? I guess, I don't know. Folks, let's see, blackboy in chat says, wait, Sky's reading

424
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,400
an ad that was thinly disguised as an email. Yeah, I guess, but it was from a friend of

425
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,400
ours so I'm okay with it. And it's a game I hadn't heard about before, so there you

426
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,400
have it. We'll check it out and give an honest opinion either way. So there you have it,

427
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,040
that's it for the mailbag. Mailbag at orangelaunchrater.com if you'd like to send us emails. Well earlier

428
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,480
we were talking a little bit, we mentioned that the Shivering Isles was coming out for

429
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,280
the Xbox, well for Oblivion on PC and Xbox 360, but it was going to be downloadable on

430
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:14,120
the 360. Conveniently enough, there is some other stuff you can download off of Microsoft's

431
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:21,640
marketplace. Well, no, you cannot download porn, as Mikul Tov would say. That's not available

432
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:28,080
yet. However, they do need a porno channel on the IPTV thing. That would sell systems.

433
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:35,640
Anyways, Jetpack, or the new Jetpack game is coming out, if you might remember Rare's

434
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:42,320
kind of little logo there. But anyways, Jetpack Refueled will be hitting the marketplace on

435
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:51,000
Wednesday and it will feature obscenely colorful graphics, whatever that's supposed to mean.

436
00:32:51,000 --> 00:33:03,360
That's obscene. 128 levels, multiplayer capabilities, the original arcade version, and continued

437
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,440
exclusion of the letter K from the title. And money shots, says Mikul Tov. It will be

438
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,560
available on the marketplace and will cost you 400 Microsoft points or $5 in real money.

439
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,840
Mikul Tov, you're giving this the thumbs down, is this one of those other games you've probably

440
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,200
played that you're not supposed to talk about? Does it suck? Can you talk about it?

441
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
It sucks.

442
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,000
Mikul Tov says, why does it suck?

443
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,560
Because it's not fun to play.

444
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
What the hell do you do?

445
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,200
You shoot things and then you fly away and it's really boring and it's not Boom Boom

446
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,680
Rocket, so why are we talking about it?

447
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,760
Well, the people want to know.

448
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,320
Well, they don't anymore.

449
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,200
Thank you very much, I suppose.

450
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:54,520
On the Xbox Live Marketplace, they had brand new heroes and villains that you could download

451
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:02,200
to expand Marvel Ultimate Alliance. It featured eight new playable characters, including the

452
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:12,040
Incredible Hulk, Magneto, Hawkeye, Sabretooth, Doctor Doom, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Venom.

453
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:20,120
They've got brand new signature powers, skins, dialogue conversations, and achievement points.

454
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
New achievement points.

455
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Isn't that a Cyclops one-eye?

456
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,800
No.

457
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,160
Total porn on Xbox Live Marketplace. Now they want you to download one-eyed monsters on

458
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:35,880
Xbox Live. Does he blast stuff out of his one-eye? Total porn is what the Xbox 360 is

459
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,880
turning to.

460
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
He doesn't have one eye. God.

461
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Does the Cyclops mean one eye?

462
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,680
It's a one-eyed monster that shoots things.

463
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,480
Like a penis.

464
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,920
You can, it's basically they have it divided up into two different packs.

465
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,240
Now, there's no need to go there, Rise Princess. That's just dirty. It's disgusting.

466
00:34:52,240 --> 00:35:00,360
They have a hero and villain pack, each of which were 500 points, or $6.25. Otherwise,

467
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:06,440
you can also buy the combo pack, which features both, and save a little bit of money. It's

468
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:12,640
800 Microsoft points, or $10. So, saving a good $2.50 there.

469
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,400
And also, they have heroes and villains gamer picks that you can download, and those are

470
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,680
each 80 Microsoft points, or $1.

471
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,440
And Chat Room, yes. I was kidding. Of course, I know who Cyclops is. I did see the X-Men

472
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,440
movies. I watched the cartoon when I was a kid. Please. James Marsters.

473
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,040
Anyways, now let's talk about a game.

474
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,160
Why are you laughing at me?

475
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,320
Because you're funny.

476
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
And Visceral.

477
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Go to hell.

478
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:55,880
Now let's talk about a game that came out a couple of weeks ago. Ghost Recon 2. Apparently,

479
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,920
Mexico doesn't like the game too much. I guess it has something to do with the Mexican terrorists

480
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
in the game.

481
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,060
Fuck Mexico. Sorry, Act Deft. Sorry.

482
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:09,120
I think what's most interesting about this story, though, because apparently the game

483
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:15,120
has been blacklisted, and I want to say Chihuahua, Mexico. Is there such a thing as a chihuahua

484
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,520
Mexico?

485
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,280
Yes, but it has nothing to do with the dog. I mean, there's a weed California, Loki. Towns

486
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
get names weird things all the time.

487
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,760
But weed makes sense, though, because weeds are just out there, and that just happens

488
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
to be slang.

489
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,680
Chihuahua's not slang. It's a dog.

490
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,240
Or Chihuahua's like, you know, they're an animal that runs around in parks like we have

491
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,480
squirrels. And Mexico hates it because they don't bathe.

492
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
Anyways.

493
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,160
Wow. The views and opinions expressed. Act Deft says, and it's a state. Like, you know,

494
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,640
how, well, it's not really a state, but, you know.

495
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,400
Anyways, so Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior Fighter 2 has been blacklisted in Chihuahua, Mexico.

496
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,120
And, you know, besides the fact that the city's got a weird name, there has been apparently

497
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:03,080
orders. Mexico has apparently ordered the confiscation of any and all copies of Tom

498
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:08,160
Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior 2 that surfaced in the state.

499
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,160
This is a report from El Diario.

500
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,360
El Diario.

501
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,760
Is that also a town?

502
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
I'm guessing they...

503
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
After the water.

504
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,720
It's not El Diario. I think it's El Diaro.

505
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:33,960
A Mexican broadsheet, which says that the action was taken after Mayor Hector... I'm

506
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,400
not even going to start pronouncing these names.

507
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:42,960
I would fucking buy Ghost Recon if they had El Diario. It's like a terrorist in it.

508
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,720
They've slammed the game as being a crime against the intellectual capacity of the Juarez

509
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:56,640
residents. And apparently, they've decided to take action. So, in any case, Game Politics

510
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,280
also notes that a statement they took from the mayor who said that violent video games

511
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,280
instill values which are upside down, these actions are despicable because they attempt

512
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,640
to divide the goodwill of the residents of America and Mexican cities.

513
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,320
So, you won't be able to get your fix on Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior 2. However, God of

514
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,760
War 2, I'm sure, is still selling like hotcakes.

515
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,680
I'd like to give our apologies to ActDeaf and any other Mexican listeners we might have.

516
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,760
Hope we didn't offend you too bad, but seriously, El Diario. That was funny.

517
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,280
However, though, if you want to get in on some of that Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior

518
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,560
2 action, it will be available on the PC. They're doing the beta test, which is starting

519
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:51,840
in April. So, definitely go and sign up on the website, which is ghostrecon.uk.ubi.com.

520
00:38:51,840 --> 00:39:01,000
I guess this would be the UK beta test, now that I've noticed that.

521
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,560
Anyways, so onto a different game. If you may not be able to play Ghost Recon Advanced

522
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,640
Warrior 2, and you live in Mexico, maybe you want to participate in the beta for Quake

523
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,480
Wars, because id Software is looking for some good first-person shooter clans to get in

524
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,680
on this beta test. And basically, what you'll need to do is have your clans register for

525
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:35,200
this, and basically you can participate by sending your application to etqwbetatestatactivision.com,

526
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,640
and with it following your clan name, number of active members, games played regularly,

527
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,320
and played competitively, your website, and details like that.

528
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:51,000
100 OLR achievement points to the first person to make the El Diario clan.

529
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,280
But Quake Wars looks awesome, can't wait to play it when it comes out on the 360. PlayStation

530
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,040
3 and PC.

531
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,800
Anyways, kind of off to a little bit of a different tangent here. Another first-person

532
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,880
game that's definitely popular out there right now is Gears of War, and New Line apparently

533
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:16,200
found time to register the rights for the movie, or secure the rights for the movie,

534
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,880
so that they can make yet another horrible video game movie.

535
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
Awesome.

536
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,080
Anyways, Variety was reporting that New Line Cinemas has snagged the rights to Gears of

537
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:35,160
War, and that Stuart Beattie will be writing the script with Marty Bowen and Wick Godfrey.

538
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
It'll suck.

539
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,760
Yeah, I can't say that I recognize any of those people.

540
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,440
How can it be good? I'm sorry, it'll suck.

541
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,920
The rights went up for auction with a 21-page treatment by Beattie, best known for his script

542
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,960
work on Collateral and Derailed. Well, Collateral and Derailed are pretty good, so...

543
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
The movie Derailed?

544
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
Yeah.

545
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,400
Oh, man, that was like the worst movie ever made. Derailed?

546
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
Yeah.

547
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
Yeah, with Jennifer Aniston?

548
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
Oh!

549
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Yeah, I forgot to...

550
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Oh, yeah!

551
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,400
Collateral's good, though. Collateral's good.

552
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,960
I never saw Collateral, but Derailed was god-awful. I wanted to, like, gouge out my eyes and stuff

553
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,960
afterwards.

554
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
I have my hopes for this movie, though.

555
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Did it make you want to kill yourself, like Ultimate Duck Hunt?

556
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,160
Yeah. I was like, oh, man.

557
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,480
It could be pretty good. They could flesh out the somewhat-existent story and actually

558
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:26,280
make something that's entertaining and kind of interesting, which video game movies usually

559
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,760
lack. At least good entertaining, not, like, ha-ha entertaining.

560
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,400
Because that idea worked so well with Resident Evil and Doom.

561
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:39,720
Resident Evil is decent. Not this new one that has that horror from Heroes on it, but...

562
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
The movies, you mean?

563
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Yeah.

564
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
Oh, they're all great.

565
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,360
Funny you should mention Resident Evil, because...

566
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
Segways!

567
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:52,560
I love Segways, because Capcom is having their Capcom Day, which I might add we weren't invited

568
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,760
to. Thank you very much.

569
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,760
What was it?

570
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,760
Capcom!

571
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
April 12th.

572
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,240
Why you got against Orange Loud Radio? Afraid we're going to say something we should?

573
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,880
What the hell was that?

574
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,880
My pouty voice.

575
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
Oh, my.

576
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
No love from Capcom.

577
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,880
Okay.

578
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,880
No love from Capcom.

579
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,360
Maybe I was a little hard on Dead Rising, but anyways.

580
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,960
Another Capcom Day is going to be April 12th. One game has been announced already, and that

581
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,220
would be the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii, and that's one thing that they're

582
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,840
hoping that will be featured there, as well as some info on Resident Evil 5 for the PlayStation

583
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,240
3 and 360.

584
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,600
Another thing, though, is they're going to be announcing a brand new game, and so we

585
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,480
don't know what exactly that is. Just a brand new game.

586
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,160
Evil Joe again, or maybe Mega Man. That would be nice.

587
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,440
Megalotov is adamant about a Phoenix Wright 3.

588
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,920
I hope not.

589
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,840
That's only the best game they've ever had in, like, ten years.

590
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
Ever.

591
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,240
Ever in ten years.

592
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,680
What about a new Mega Man game? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?

593
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
Well, there's...

594
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,560
Well, how about taking Mega Man back to its roots?

595
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,560
Taking it back.

596
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,560
Taking it back. Back to its roots.

597
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,720
That would be great if they did that, because I don't know what's up with all the...

598
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Mega Man Z.

599
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
The whole new franchise.

600
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,720
Battle Network, whatever, crap.

601
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,720
They already did Mega Man Z, and it sucked.

602
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,720
Oh.

603
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
Mega Man 9.

604
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,720
Crap.

605
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
Just Mega Man 9? I'd go for that.

606
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,840
Mega Man ZX. It was horrible.

607
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,520
How about just Mega Man? You know, I think folks will forgive you if you just want to

608
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,520
start over with his name.

609
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,640
How about just redo Mega Man Legends? Legends was pretty fun. Legends 3. Seriously, bring

610
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Tron Bon back.

611
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,640
Alright, I'm done.

612
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,640
Alright, anyways.

613
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:40,440
Finally, this kind of... got to bring it full circle back to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

614
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,960
Move over, King Kong! There's a new leader of ultimate easy achievement points, and that

615
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:52,080
is TMNT the game. Apparently, you can get all 1000 achievement points within 4 hours.

616
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,080
It is that easy.

617
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,080
Dang.

618
00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:00,920
So, the game itself, though, hasn't been getting that very good reviews, but hey, it's worth

619
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,760
a rental for an easy 1000 achievement points.

620
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,000
What do you do in it? Did they say what the achievement points are?

621
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,680
They haven't said, but basically, the quote, Team Xbox. If there's one good thing about

622
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,080
TMNT, it's the fact that the game steals the title for easiest 1000 achievement points

623
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:24,040
from Ubisoft's own King Kong. You'll probably be able to get all 1000 in less than 4 hours.

624
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:29,200
Let's see what else here. GameSpot says there's also achievements to consider, but they also

625
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,800
happen to be incredibly easy to acquire, with many of them regulated to points for beating

626
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,280
levels and pulling off individual special abilities. Even still, the better graphics

627
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:45,400
and achievements ultimately make the 360 version the best by default.

628
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,960
Hmm. Interesting. I might check it out. It seems like something that would be like a

629
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,960
rental, but I don't know if I'd buy that, especially just for 1000 achievement points.

630
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,360
I don't care. The Tetris game I bought today seems to have okay achievement points. It's

631
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,560
doable if you are any good at Tetris.

632
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:08,800
I'm telling you. Earth Defense Force 2017. It's the dumbest game on the face of the earth,

633
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,320
but so fun to play.

634
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,120
But is it easy to use?

635
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,200
Not easy achievement points at all. Although, actually, no. Probably beating a game on easy

636
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,680
and normal would be relatively easy, although normal is pretty hard. But that's what's the

637
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,680
good thing about it.

638
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,000
It's open, by the way. A username, OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype. 1-877-GAME-OLR.

639
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,080
That's kind of the good thing about it, though, is because it is so hard, it will take you

640
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:36,600
a while to beat the game. Yes, it does get frustrating, but you can strategize and replay

641
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:42,960
certain levels to get your hit points up as you keep playing them. Plus, you unlock different

642
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,160
weapons that might help out with playing through the levels at a harder difficulty or something

643
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,320
like that. There's a lot of strategy involved there. Plus, it's just so cheesy and stupid

644
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:57,960
that you gotta play it. I mean, your other guys will yell weird shit like, oh no! Tiny

645
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,520
died! Oh no! Big stuff died!

646
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,600
I don't know. I just want to keep playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night right now,

647
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,320
to be honest. All over again. Like, it was the first time.

648
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,320
Heck yeah.

649
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,040
We got a call on the old Skype line. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

650
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,040
This is DMN.

651
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,440
Hello, DMN! Long time, no talk. What's on your mind?

652
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,720
This is CNN.

653
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,480
No, it's not. Don't get us sued. This is OLR. What's on your mind, DMN?

654
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,880
Well, I came across your website a couple days ago, and I noticed the Katamari story

655
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,640
got removed.

656
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:38,880
Interesting you should bring that up. What do you want to say about it?

657
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,880
Fuck GameSpot and everything it stands for regarding that. Didn't they pull the story

658
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,560
up only a few days after, and not even cite OrangeLoungeRadio for it?

659
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,860
I can't comment on this at this time. Next week we'll have an official statement on what's

660
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,920
going on, but we can't comment on what's going on at this time.

661
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,920
Wow.

662
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,960
So, that's it.

663
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,960
Okay.

664
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,120
Anything else you want to ask us about? Thanks for bringing that up.

665
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:12,120
What'd you say, Mikal Tom?

666
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,600
I was going to ask him about how much he hates the stupid people in WoW, because he was complaining

667
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
about it earlier.

668
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,080
Oh yeah, you're in our WoW guild. What's going on in WoW?

669
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,280
I'm just getting sick of all the stupid people who think that Internet shorthand is okay

670
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,440
in that fucking game. Like, it's acceptable to a degree.

671
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,600
Like, OOL and stuff like that?

672
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:43,880
Okay. For example, don't use the letter U to represent you. It's two extra fucking letters

673
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,400
you can type. Y-O-U. Jesus Christ.

674
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,280
Isn't there some type of add-on that you can get for World of Warcraft that will allow

675
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,520
you to automatically... I remember DrewNami was telling me about this once when he was

676
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,280
here. It was something about, I don't know, some filter that would automatically change

677
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,680
the letter U into Y-O-U and it would change a lot of the noob speak for you.

678
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,240
God, I need to find that.

679
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,520
DrewNami's chat, he says it's called Eloquence, is what it's called.

680
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:15,000
I'll have to pick that up, because I don't mind typing out full words in full sentences,

681
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,760
but I guess I'm the only person.

682
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,480
That's why you should just stay with your guild, because we all type normally.

683
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,320
I love my guild. My guild's awesome.

684
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,600
We are awesome.

685
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,600
And go vote for the songs for the STFU song tournament. We're at the Sweet 16. The big

686
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,600
match-up right now is Colors vs So Deep.

687
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,640
Go So Deep.

688
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,160
Alright, you guys should vote. Ready, set, Rob's going to hang up on me.

689
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,520
No, I'm not, but thank you very much for striking the nerve and allowing me to tease next week.

690
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,600
No problem. Have a good weekend.

691
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,600
Alright, you too.

692
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,600
Alright, bye.

693
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,600
Bye.

694
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,600
Bye, DMN.

695
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:56,840
If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number, or you can call us, username

696
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:03,000
is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype. I swear we didn't pay him to call in and ask about that.

697
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,080
Funny you should mention that. Loki and I were just talking about that before the show.

698
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,080
Let's go to another call.

699
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,080
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

700
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,520
It's Legend of Zaku.

701
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,640
Hi, Legend of Zaku. What's on your mind?

702
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:26,360
Nah, just chilling. Nothing much, but I'm off the heels of a shitty tournament that

703
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,640
I went to yesterday, then getting filmed for a DDR documentary.

704
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,040
You went to a DDR tournament yesterday that was shitty. What tournament was this?

705
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:41,280
This was one out in Long Island, far from where I live, but me and three other players

706
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,640
from the city just went out there.

707
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,840
Don't they have pretty good transit, though? Because you can take transit out to the whole

708
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,840
city.

709
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,840
Of course, we took the railroad.

710
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,640
There you go. You guys have much better out there when it comes to transit than we do.

711
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,680
It's kind of harder out here.

712
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:00,720
The place we went to was really accessible. The only good thing about it was the documentary

713
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,040
that two NYU students were filming on DDR players.

714
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,000
What's the documentary? I have to be honest, though. A DDR documentary does not strike

715
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,760
me as anything new. What makes this one special?

716
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:25,680
One day, this NYU film student was just filming the four of us through the tournament and

717
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:32,320
just through our normal routines, just doing all the stupid things that we do. In addition,

718
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:38,200
we were actually interviewed. We were asked questions about the basic stuff about how

719
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,200
long we've been playing DDR. We got into it.

720
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:47,960
Then we have other questions such as how do you see yourself in the scene years from now?

721
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,360
That sort of thing. It's kind of like a future perspective.

722
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:56,000
I was once interviewed for one of these documentaries. I believe it was right when we started Orange

723
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,640
Lounge. It was about a year after we started. I don't think these people knew about the

724
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,640
radio stations.

725
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,960
I used to do freestyling under a pseudonym, Dr. Dick. I just would get up on the machine

726
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,800
and do an improv and just fuck off. I'd wear a funny hat. They wanted to interview me for

727
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,000
this documentary. They wanted me to wear the funny hat. I said no because I knew they would

728
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,040
edit me to look like an idiot. I didn't want that.

729
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:25,880
The documentary right now is still ongoing. She plans on filming more tournaments in the

730
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:34,080
next few weeks, especially some major ones, some in the group two tournaments with R21.

731
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:38,280
It's only the tip of the iceberg right now since she has plenty of time to work on it.

732
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:46,680
It's going to be a little bit more in depth than just a one-time thing.

733
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,120
I'm sorry to hear the tournament was not all that fun. What do you think a future tournament

734
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,640
organizer should consider in planning a DDR tournament?

735
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:00,400
Fix the pads. It needs better pads, period. That's the only thing that just killed it

736
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:08,400
right there. The pads were pretty horrible. For certain players, they got lucky because

737
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,480
they were managing to get by, but they were getting a lot of pad misses. It just didn't

738
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
feel right.

739
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,640
Make sure your damn machine is working before you have a tournament. Fair enough?

740
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,640
All right.

741
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,960
Thank you, Zaku. We appreciate the call.

742
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,960
All right.

743
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,960
Later.

744
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,960
Bye.

745
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,960
Bye.

746
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,880
Going to chat room and looking at comments while we wait for more phone calls. 1-877

747
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:37,600
Game OLR. DDR dollar bill says, Dr. Dick, that was you? Yeah. I didn't think there was

748
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,680
anything on YouTube. There was some freestyle video floating around for a little while.

749
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,880
I was just dancing like an idiot. It was nothing serious. It was just silly.

750
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,080
Let's see. Black boy, I guess I'm going to say this. Black boy in chat says, so wait,

751
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:54,200
IGN or GameSpot ripped off OLR's news and didn't credit them. No, that's not what's

752
00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:01,020
going on. Again, we can't say too much yet because we're kind of waiting to make an official

753
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:06,940
thing, but we're not claiming that at all. What we will say is that it is interesting

754
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:11,760
that other sites are reporting the exact same thing that we did and other sites are continuing

755
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,240
to run that information. I suppose that's all we can say at this time. Correct?

756
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,240
Correct.

757
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:22,960
All right. Let's go to another call, that being said. Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

758
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,960
Who's this?

759
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,960
Hey, what's up guys? It's Toshin.

760
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,960
Hi, Toshin. What's on your mind?

761
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:33,440
I don't want to bring this all to a wow tangent, but I got to ask something. In the last couple

762
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,800
weeks, you said you've been playing well a lot, right?

763
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,800
Yep.

764
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,160
How long have you been playing well?

765
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,680
Like how many hours a week do I put in the game or how long have I been?

766
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,680
Overall.

767
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,240
Overall? This recent round, I just started playing right when Burning Crusade came out

768
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,960
about a week after, so January this year. I've played on and off since, oh hell, I don't

769
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:03,180
even remember when I made the first character, probably about a year ago, I want to say.

770
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:08,760
Is it a hard game to get into? I must be the only one that I know, speaking for myself,

771
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,160
that has never played a multi RPG or anything like that.

772
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,240
Migotov wants to chime in.

773
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,880
Have you started playing it yet or are you just thinking about it?

774
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:23,320
My friends, and I know a lot of people, including Rob, who have played it a lot somewhat, and

775
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:28,360
I find it interesting stuff, but I've just never come to bring myself to invest the time

776
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,520
in it. Is it a hard thing to get into?

777
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:38,560
It really depends on what class you play, what server you're playing on. If you're playing

778
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,560
with friends or not.

779
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,720
I think, yeah, because the social element of the game is huge.

780
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,360
If you were to join our guild, you'd probably have a good time as long as you picked a decent

781
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,320
class to play around with. Something that's not so hard, something you can just pick up

782
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:55,720
and be like, oh, I can do this on my own without too much problem.

783
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,340
It definitely feels rewarding sometimes playing in it. It's pretty fun.

784
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:02,920
I think the nice thing about WoW is that Blizzard has it set up really easy for you to take

785
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,560
your first hit, basically. You can download essentially the whole damn thing and get easily

786
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:13,080
a 10-day free trial from somebody. I'm sure Migotov, myself, or any of us would be willing

787
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,080
to hook you up with a 10-day trial.

788
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,960
You can download it on WoW's site now, because you don't even have to know somebody that

789
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,560
has the game. You can just download it free time.

790
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,240
That's cool. It's very easy to set up and run with now, to at least try it out and see

791
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:29,160
if it's something for you. If you've never played an MMO before, it might be a little

792
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,160
weird.

793
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,160
Yeah, it'd be a total noob.

794
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,160
So you're a total noob. Well, that's cool, because you've called into this show enough

795
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,120
before, and you've been in chat long enough so that I know you're not a dumbass, and you

796
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,800
speak intelligently when you type and everything. You don't use the letter U for U and all that.

797
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,520
So I don't think you're going to really have a problem fitting in, so to speak, into WoW.

798
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:52,480
But have you ever played Diablo, or a game like it?

799
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,600
I've fiddled with it. My friend's like, here, take my map and run over to this spot on the

800
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,160
map. I'm like, what do I do if I run into something? Click the mouse button or something

801
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,160
like that.

802
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,720
Part of getting into WoW, don't be afraid to die. Everybody dies the first couple of

803
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:09,160
times they play. The game is not set up so that your character will get deleted forever

804
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,160
if you die a few times.

805
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,800
Dying is kind of cool because it changes the way the game looks until you get to your body,

806
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,600
so die a lot.

807
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,920
I honestly found WoW a lot easier to get into than Final Fantasy XI. I'm not trying to knock

808
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,640
Final Fantasy XI. I played it for a long time, and I have some good memories from that game,

809
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:29,680
but it was a lot harder to figure out the first time than WoW was. WoW was set up pretty

810
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,440
easy to just kind of jump into and go.

811
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,720
Well, I have a question for you guys. Did you guys ever read the manual?

812
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,720
No.

813
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,720
No.

814
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,720
Yeah.

815
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,440
I've never read manuals to games.

816
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,440
Really?

817
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,440
Yeah, nor do I.

818
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,280
Actually, I'll tell you that I cracked open Final Fantasy XI's manual because I got so

819
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,560
frustrated I didn't know how to do something. I finally had to look it up how to do it.

820
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,960
I think I did too, but that was during the 13-hour install of the game. I was just like,

821
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,960
I need something to do.

822
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:58,800
Yeah. See, I think if you're brand new to MMOs, it wouldn't hurt to go through the manual

823
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:05,000
and see some of the advice it gives and how to do certain things because my first MMO

824
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,800
was Guild Wars, and I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

825
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,800
Guild Wars was confusing.

826
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:15,000
It was confusing. When I started playing WoW, I thought I knew what I was doing, but I kind

827
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
of didn't. I looked in the manual, and it helped me a lot, so that would be my advice.

828
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,240
Joshin, I guess I end with this. What do you got to lose?

829
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,240
Money?

830
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,440
Your life, actually. Your real life, you have to lose.

831
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,720
You can at least get the free trial to start it off, you know?

832
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,280
Join Ravencrest, and we'll help you out.

833
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,280
Yeah, Ravencrest Horde side, and you can play with us, and we're cool.

834
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,280
How long's the trial?

835
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,280
Ten days.

836
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,280
Ten days?

837
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,120
Enough for you to take your first hit and decide if it's something you want to continue,

838
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,760
and then you can go from there. I know it's, what, 1295, 1495 months?

839
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,760
1495, but you get limited character.

840
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,240
How much Canadian? Toshin's in Canada, so...

841
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,240
I don't know.

842
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,240
Who cares?

843
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,240
A little more.

844
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,240
There you go. Who cares?

845
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,760
Who cares, eh? Who cares, eh?

846
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,760
All right.

847
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,760
All right.

848
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,160
Well, Toshin, we hope to see you online, but if not, you know...

849
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,440
I'm in the chat room. You know where to find me.

850
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:07,200
All right, we do. Any other thoughts or comments tonight?

851
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,520
Not really. I'd like to just say, Travis, thanks for letting me win the game yesterday.

852
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,480
There you have it. Travis Donovan live on Saturday nights. If you want to know what

853
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,760
the hell Toshin's talking about, you've got to download Saturday's archive, correct?

854
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,760
That's correct.

855
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,760
There you go.

856
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,760
Not pimping or anything. I'm here for Olara only.

857
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,680
That's fine. That's fine. Travis has an OLR program. We love having him on board.

858
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,680
Okay.

859
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:27,680
All right. Take care, buddy.

860
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,680
See you later.

861
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,680
See you.

862
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:44,720
All right, well, we'll see you in the next one.

863
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,720
Bye.

864
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,720
Bye.

865
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,720
Bye.

866
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,720
Bye.

867
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:59,720
You were in chat saying WoW can be played casually. And WoW has that rest bar feature.

868
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:05,600
That's what I liked about WoW is that it has the rest bar so that the addicts get a little

869
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,800
bit of a handicap, shall we say, amongst the folks who only can log in occasionally. And

870
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,860
that's what's kept me afloat sometimes in that game because I just went four days without

871
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,480
signing in. I probably have so much rest bar. It's crazy.

872
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,640
It also just depends on the MMO you pick if you really feel like you need to dedicate

873
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,720
a lot of time to it. I played Final Fantasy XI casually and that's not a casual game whatsoever.

874
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,680
One more call then, shall we? Let's do another call.

875
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,680
Yes.

876
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:33,420
Well, hi. Yes. Damn it. Hi. You're on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?

877
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:35,760
One more thing, Ravenstaufen.

878
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,660
I like how you've incorporated that into your name. What's on your mind, One More Thing,

879
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,080
Ravenstaufen?

880
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,880
The Sony PlayStation launch in Europe. That's been on my mind for a while.

881
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,920
And how so? Why has that been on your mind?

882
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,120
We got shot.

883
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,120
We got shot?

884
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,640
We as a collective people got shot.

885
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,600
Did you get shot looking for your PlayStation 3?

886
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,960
Oh no. I stood in my bunker. I was in my room.

887
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:06,200
There you go. Well, what do you mean? So you're saying you're surprised because we were all

888
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,960
getting shot over it and what's that?

889
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,860
And Sony gave out TVs for the Europeans and I thought that was nice. But they didn't

890
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,440
do it for us.

891
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,000
Don't you think Sony kind of owed Europe something though? Like, sorry you had to wait

892
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
six months.

893
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,820
Oh, most definitely.

894
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:29,360
So what's interesting is that the first hundred folks got a TV but the second hundred folks

895
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:35,960
got flak jackets in case they got shot. So Sony is very nice over there in Europe.

896
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,960
That's a one also on the jokes there.

897
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,960
That's a W.

898
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,400
That's what I get for improvising here on the program.

899
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,160
What else is on your mind concerning this whole PlayStation 3 stuff Raven's Dolphin?

900
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,120
Two more things, Sky.

901
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:56,720
How is that capability testing going at the Sony Corporation?

902
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:05,560
I still stick to what I said when that whole joke came up in the first place on All Games

903
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,780
Interactive. If you're buying a PlayStation 3 to play PlayStation 2 games, you are buying

904
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:13,520
a PlayStation 3 for the wrong reasons.

905
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,160
Okay, I got a joke for you.

906
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,800
Goodie, I can't wait for this. All right, what is that?

907
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:22,600
All right, a man walked into a doctor's office wearing ceram wrap.

908
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,600
What?

909
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,600
What did the doctor say?

910
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:29,640
Let him finish. Sorry Raven's Dolphin, what?

911
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:36,920
A man walked into a doctor's office and he dressed in ceram wrap. What did the doctor

912
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,400
say?

913
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,280
Why the fuck are you sitting in my office dressed in fucking ceram wrap, you fucking

914
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,280
freak?

915
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,280
No, I see you're nuts.

916
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,280
One.

917
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,280
One.

918
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:56,420
I'd be a little nicer. I'd give it a three, Raven's Dolphin.

919
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:57,420
A for effort.

920
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:02,480
What's with the balls jokes? First it was Bill Cosby and now it's just some random guy.

921
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,640
They got the memo, you like balls.

922
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,640
All right.

923
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,640
Okay.

924
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,640
All right, Raven's Dolphin, thanks for the call, but on that note-

925
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,640
Visit secondgames.com.

926
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,640
All right, bye.

927
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:18,280
Good times, it's paid.

928
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,880
I think that's a good way to end the calls for tonight. What do you think?

929
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,880
Sure, why not?

930
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,920
I see you're nuts, Riz Princess. You're fucking nuts.

931
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:26,920
That's awkward.

932
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,920
Fucking butts.

933
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:35,360
Is that it for the show? Are there any other last minute stories you came across, Loki?

934
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,120
I have one, it's big. I have a big last minute story for you guys.

935
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,120
Let's go.

936
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:45,160
A little birdie has told me, and this is a rumor, but a little birdie told me that Paper

937
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:51,520
Mario may be on its way to Virtual Console sooner than you think. Super Paper Mario's

938
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:59,000
release may coincide with that. Stop booing Paper Mario, Miklotov, it's a fine game. So

939
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,880
there you have it. Don't count that game out just yet.

940
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:04,120
Wasn't that a GameCube title or is that a 64 title?

941
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:09,520
It was originally Nintendo 64, but I believe there was the thousand year door or whatever

942
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,600
was on GameCube. The original was Nintendo 64.

943
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,600
Oh, cool.

944
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,440
Oh, I just got a good news story right here.

945
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:19,440
What's that?

946
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,800
In actual news though, here's another rumor for you.

947
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,800
Don't laugh, it encourages her.

948
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:33,720
And this is going to be even more confusing, but apparently according to NGC magazine in

949
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:42,360
the UK, an article in there said, there's no screenshots of it yet, but the UK version

950
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:49,340
of Pokemon Battle Revolution will not have the restrictions of the friend code system.

951
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:50,340
Really?

952
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:51,340
So that's confusing.

953
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:56,920
So in other words, Europe might not have to, because they don't have child molesters in

954
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,280
Europe I guess, they're not going to have to worry about friend codes maybe.

955
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,440
Hear that or maybe they're just, I don't know, a little laid back.

956
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,720
Everybody needs to look Reggie Fils-Aime in the eye and go, friend codes, yes or no, I

957
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,360
want a clear answer, don't BS me.

958
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:14,560
What they should do is say, I will arm wrestle you, Reggie, and the winner decides a friend

959
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,560
code thing. That's how it should be done.

960
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,800
But Reggie would win every time.

961
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:23,920
You just got to get someone stronger. We need to get Chuck Norris. That's what we need to

962
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:24,920
do.

963
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:34,040
Anyways, um, what else? Let's see here, 3Speech, which I remember from-

964
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,360
The chatter sent me a story I need to read, but go ahead and do yours first.

965
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:43,960
3Speech is saying that there's more download content on the way, and I think if I remember

966
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,000
correctly that's the semi-official Sony blog.

967
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:57,240
Anyways, Genji Dazeblade says more excitement will be coming, including new armor, I guess.

968
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:02,920
Oh, and yeah, new armor for your four playable characters.

969
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,920
Don't care.

970
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,920
Don't care.

971
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:10,920
Ridge Racer 7, I'm supposed to be getting some more decal packs.

972
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,760
So I guess that's neat.

973
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:17,760
MotorStorm, it says any PS3 player playing MotorStorm online will receive time trial

974
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,760
mode automatically.

975
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,760
That actually, I think, was launched this week, so I know that's going into effect.

976
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:26,700
There's supposed to be some new friend codes, er, not friend codes, system, like a friends

977
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,760
list system for that as well.

978
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:34,920
And Resistance Fallen Man, two new playable maps, Western Moreland and Kambor, those are

979
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,380
coming soon as well. I think those are coming in April.

980
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:41,600
One of our users, Meklar, wanted me to share this with you. He sent me this in chat. It's

981
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,960
a story from Kotaku. Somebody named John, I guess, who's a reader of the site, just

982
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,960
got home from the launch at the Virgin Mega Store in London.

983
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,520
Apparently, they were all given some chairs. There were some friendly folks on hand giving

984
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,960
out some camping chairs.

985
01:05:53,960 --> 01:06:02,120
And on the back of the chairs, it said, shouldn't have kept you waiting. And it was www.shkyw.org.

986
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:09,320
And if you visit the URL, Xbox welcomes PlayStation 3 to the next generation.

987
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:15,520
Sony, you're late. Let the games begin.

988
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,440
And it looks to be just a big Microsoft ad here. There might be sound with this. I'm

989
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,440
visiting.

990
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,800
Oh, it's just a little flash animation that goes, Xbox welcomes PlayStation 3 to the next

991
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,800
generation.

992
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,840
Who knows if that was an official Microsoft sanctioned thing, but that's pretty funny

993
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,840
either way.

994
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,760
They had barges and stuff there during the France launch as well.

995
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,760
Really?

996
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,760
Yeah.

997
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,760
Cute.

998
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,760
Apparently, there is a...

999
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:36,760
That's cute, Microsoft.

1000
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:45,320
A 2D version of Ocarina of Time being made by some guy, looks like named Richard. And

1001
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:49,720
he's dead now from a car crash. So no 2D Ocarina of Time for you.

1002
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:54,320
I'm so glad Loki doesn't report the real news because he would have no sensitivity whatsoever.

1003
01:06:54,320 --> 01:07:01,200
In better news though, Matrix is coming to HD DVD and Blu-ray and that's awesome.

1004
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,960
Can I say I'm sorry to hear about the guy behind the project? That's too bad.

1005
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,480
Ocarina of Time was overrated anyways. Why would you want to make a 2D version of that

1006
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,480
anyway?

1007
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,800
I am so distancing myself from Loki's comments. Now is not the time to bring up that issue,

1008
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,040
Loki. Now is not the time.

1009
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:23,760
Because it's an incorrect statement. It's not overrated. It's overgood.

1010
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,760
Overgood.

1011
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,760
Yeah.

1012
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,760
More gooder.

1013
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,760
Overgooder.

1014
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,440
More gooder. This for the person who is teasing me over the whole vehicular or whatever the

1015
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,440
fuck I said earlier.

1016
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,640
Alright. Alright. Can we please end the damn show now?

1017
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,640
What was it? Visceral?

1018
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,640
Visceral. Whatever it was.

1019
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,280
Oh man, I have a funny laugh.

1020
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:50,720
I'm glad you're here to make the occasional fart joke and then tease me about mispronouncing

1021
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,880
words. What the fuck else did you contribute to tonight's show?

1022
01:07:53,880 --> 01:08:00,480
Awesomeness? I don't know. At least I think so.

1023
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:08,000
Alright. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Rice Princess, we'll start

1024
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
with you.

1025
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,560
I just want to say thanks to everyone who added me as friends on the All Games Radio

1026
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,560
community.

1027
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,560
Yep.

1028
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,920
Miklotov, do you have a final thought?

1029
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,440
Why are you staring at me?

1030
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,440
Nope.

1031
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:25,760
Loki, do you have a final thought?

1032
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:33,520
Well, I'm looking forward to playing more Earth Defense Force 2017. I guess I have to

1033
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:39,680
wait until Super Paper Mario comes out before I get to play something new. Or do I?

1034
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,720
The hell is that supposed to mean, you smug little bastard?

1035
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,720
I think you know what it means.

1036
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:50,120
Alright. Alright. Maybe. Alright. And my final thought. Thank you very much for listening

1037
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,560

1038

a kind review on iTunes or tell a friend. If you tell two friends about Orange Launch

1040
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,240
Princess's fart noises can spread throughout the world. It's a great thing. There you go.

1041
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:12,040
With her mouth, folks, not her butt. That's gross. Have a great week. We'll see you next
