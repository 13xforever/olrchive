14177	25263	Tonight, March 25th, 2007, Black Xbox 360s turn out to be real, Devil May Cry 4 is no longer an exclusive, and an old 80s arcade classic comes to Blu-ray.
27725	35429	Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35469	37830	We are that video game podcast dedicated...
38171	38591	TechMasterLoki
56806	57026	DarkSakura
76663	80766	I was all excited, too, because I saw a Doctor Who pinball machine this weekend, which I'll get into a little bit.
81046	84488	No, but seriously, I was like, oh my gosh, this is like, this is Jamie times two.
84568	87070	These are like two of her loves rolled up into one.
87410	91532	Like, sort of like what I thought of, like, Loki, I've had this thought about you before.
91573	97196	The first time I ever went to that restaurant in the Bay Area that serves the slabs of meat, and they served the chicken wrapped in bacon.
97236	99337	That made me think of you, because I was like, it's two of Loki's loves.
99357	102779	I might add the chicken wrapped in bacon wasn't that great when I had it, so.
103060	103560	Sorry to hear that.
103956	107038	All right, well, we do have a female perspective on tonight's program.
107058	111262	You know, not that we really need one, but we have one anyway.
111622	113403	Just teasing to all the ladies out there listening.
113443	114704	Say hello to Rice Princess.
115125	116045	Hello, everyone.
116245	117426	How are you doing, Miss Rice Princess?
117667	118327	I'm doing well.
118387	119328	How about you, Rob?
119828	120549	Oh, pretty good.
120789	122010	It's been an interesting week.
122597	123297	Yeah, I agree.
123317	124038	I agree.
124178	124478	It has.
124718	126960	So you were talking about movies before we came in tonight.
126980	127700	What did you see this week?
128020	129801	I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
129941	130502	Now how was it?
130522	133083	Because I read a review in some magazine that said it was absolute crap.
133243	136465	Well, that magazine's absolute crap because it was so fucking awesome.
137046	138447	Like, it was fucking epic.
138667	139127	It was great.
139347	142849	Was it better than the old school ones from like the 90s with the ninja rap?
143009	144010	They're two different things.
144050	145191	That's apples and oranges.
145351	148153	I just, I loved it and I love the old movies too.
148213	148773	Chime in, Matt.
149272	151976	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
163118	165100	But I swear, go see it.
165320	166221	It's fucking awesome.
166261	170384	And the reason why, they did make... It does tie in with the other three movies.
171725	174747	And they do make some changes to the storyline.
175328	177790	It basically takes place after everything.
177890	180772	And so April O'Neil's not a reporter anymore.
180912	184175	And Casey Jones isn't exactly like he was in the other movies.
184635	185296	But that's fine.
185516	187217	You kind of forgive that when you see it.
187478	187798	It's just...
188490	189311	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
209369	217755	It was very satisfying, and I really suggest just ignore the negative reviews out there for it, because it really is good, and I cannot wait for the sequel.
218155	220377	Are you on somebody's payola, like New Line's payola?
220397	220537	I'm not.
220577	222719	I'm not on anybody's payroll for this kind of stuff.
222899	227582	It was awesome, and yeah, I would love to see it again.
227682	236448	It really, there's a lot of parts that even have, you know, I was telling Irene about one scene towards the end of the movie or something, which has to do with my Cage Man song, by the way.
236849	237129	Yeah.
237828	241750	That it's just when that scene kicked in, it was like, fuck, yeah, that's awesome.
241870	248354	So highly, highly recommend this movie, especially if you're a fan of, you know, the original Ninja Turtles movie.
248834	251135	Maybe not so much number two and definitely not three.
251235	254717	But, you know, even the old series and stuff, it really works.
254817	259300	And it sounds like that this is going to be something that kind of jump starts the whole movie series all over again.
259840	271144	I'm looking at our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show, because, you know, part of what makes this show so unique, shall we say, is that we always encourage the live interaction with our chat room and the phone calls, which we'll take later.
271224	274985	Chat.OrangeLawnRadio.com if you want to join in, if you're listening live on this Sunday night.
275946	276766	Let's see, we have...
277734	280837	Blaze from the OL Army says, TMNT was fucking amazing.
281638	283619	Joshi16 says, one of the turtles is gay.
283960	284720	Is there a gay turtle now?
284740	286001	There's not a gay turtle in there.
286402	286982	Not at all.
287042	287723	Okay.
287803	288243	Let's see.
288624	291446	WonderDogHerald says, are they really still teenagers at this point?
292627	293528	Okay, well, maybe not.
293728	295209	Yeah, because they're pretty old by now.
295270	298773	But I was kind of thinking, well, maybe teenage for, like, turtles.
298793	300754	I don't know how long turtles live, but, you know.
301755	302536	Yeah, I've never done that.
302556	304037	Maybe it's, like, dog ears or something like that.
304217	304758	No, so I don't know.
304997	317167	Well, I mean, not to, I don't think this is spoiling anything, but they've all like kind of, I guess, taken on like responsibilities or have like moved on past like how they used to live before.
317287	321010	So I guess it's kind of showing that they've like grown up a little bit, but I don't know.
321050	323492	They still, I guess their mentality is still kind of like a teenage mentality.
323512	325874	There was a lot of adult humor in it, which is great.
326054	327616	Like a lot of funny stuff.
327836	328957	It was just awesome.
329017	329257	I mean,
330343	333785	I mean, if anyone's going to see it, obviously it doesn't have to do a shredder anymore.
333825	335205	This is kind of after all that.
335245	336046	They defeated them.
336086	339827	The Foot Clan's kind of been disbanded a little bit, or at least they've gone underground.
340307	348691	And then it's kind of what they've done since then that kind of went on with their lives is because now they don't have to really protect New York from anything.
349211	350672	They're just kind of living.
352753	355754	So now they have to kind of come together and, you know,
356460	357861	It was really awesome.
357961	363164	Even the opening scene where they're showing kind of that flashback with the battle and stuff, that was awesome.
363204	365045	That was great.
365285	369268	Right now I was like, oh my god, this movie's going to be cool.
369328	371229	It never let you down at all.
371569	381735	There was a little bit of humor from the show because they were kind of, you know, Michelangelo of course is still goofy and stuff, but it wasn't detracting and it fit.
381835	383256	It fit with the characters and
383988	388053	I'm just really glad they kind of respected the actual characters and didn't make it so...
388729	389629	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
416670	420653	I know, I know, like I'm all, did like some Chinese dude like those boys?
420673	421593	No, he sounded Jewish.
421853	422054	Really?
422534	423094	You think so?
423915	424735	I'm like, wow.
424815	426016	Oh my god, Turtles.
426476	428298	I know, seriously, it was kind of weird.
428398	430039	Well, alright, we could talk movies all night.
430059	431820	Did any of you guys play the games yet?
431840	432640	The new Turtles games?
433101	434201	I played the old one on Netflix.
434221	436083	That and like the movie did kind of suck.
436923	442687	Alright, well let's get into a little bit of how was your gaming week where we talk about the video games that we've been playing this week here on the program.
442907	443968	Rice Princess, what have you been playing?
445509	445689	Um...
446486	449234	I have actually not played anything.
449844	454407	This week, like I said before, I canceled my WoW account for the time being.
454647	454847	Ouch.
455107	459990	So I kind of have been not doing, I've been like doing stuff around the house.
460150	463792	Did you watch anyone play something that looked cool that you wanted to have?
464112	465253	Oh, no, you know what I played?
465293	466333	I played DDR.
466753	467234	Did you?
467314	467734	In the arcade.
467754	468614	There you go, there's something.
468634	470335	Yeah, so the first time in like two years.
470375	471256	It was awesome.
471656	473517	It was Supernova, Extreme.
473817	478260	I played Supernova and I played a little bit of, whatever is that golf line?
478460	478640	Yeah.
479258	479958	Earth Defense Force 2017
507401	508142	It is awesome.
508362	515166	It is so stupid and so ridiculous, and the voice acting is so horrible, but it's so fun to play.
515306	518728	It's just, basically, at least... I know nothing about this game.
518748	519188	What is this?
519248	525251	It is basically these aliens come and start attacking Earth, and it is so B-movie cheesy and stuff.
525291	526952	I mean, for example... Like, destroy all humans?
527413	528093	Not exactly.
528213	531095	Like, we're talking, like, robots and giant ants.
531335	533036	I mean, that's giant ants.
533156	536438	That's what you're fighting for the first few levels is giant ants.
537140	539121	and it works.
539141	542361	Well, in Final Fantasy you fight giant slimes to level up.
542601	547403	Okay, but still though, I mean, it's giant ants and the voice acting is so horrible.
547443	552424	Like, for example, they're all, look, it's flying, or look at those alien spaceships.
552464	554564	It's like something out of the science fiction movie.
554684	557605	Not a science fiction movie, the science fiction movie.
557805	560086	Like the one and only that's ever been made.
560546	561626	And so, um...
562671	564492	I don't know, it's just, I can't stop playing.
564533	568075	Basically, you have, you can collect up to 200 weapons in this game.
568415	573299	And by replaying the levels over and over, you can level up your characters or whatever, get your stamina higher.
573659	576622	And you can actually, you can play it through five different difficulty levels.
576962	580264	I've been playing it through, like, Normal and Easy, and even Normal's starting to get hard now.
580284	586889	I've been playing it on Hard, which is not even all the way up to, like, they have, like, Extreme and Inferno or something.
587430	591393	Hard is fucking impossible, so Inferno's gotta be...
592279	592879	Oh my god.
594040	595960	But it's pretty fun, though.
596521	599422	It's two-player co-op, which is kind of cool, split-screen.
599822	601842	So I'm really looking forward to playing that at work.
601942	603563	But it's just so cheesy, though.
603723	605704	It's really worth picking up.
606264	607825	The achievements are not easy in it.
608305	612746	It's basically beating the game on each difficulty and unlocking every single weapon.
612806	613727	That's your achievements.
614067	616127	Six achievements for 1,000 points.
616207	620449	But it's one of those games, though, you have infinite ammo.
621068	623330	and you have some weird weapons that are in the game.
623370	626031	In fact, there's one missile that I unlocked in the very beginning.
626071	626832	It's a piece of shit.
627392	629553	It's the slowest moving missile I've ever seen.
629893	632155	I mean, the thing is going, like, less than five miles an hour.
632175	635877	It's just crawling across the air and doesn't hardly do any damage.
635937	640880	But it's fun because you can pick, you know, one of two weapons to use throughout the whole game.
641440	644082	So you just select your weapons, play your mission, and that's it.
644342	646404	And the best part about it, though, you can blow up everything.
646664	647604	Buildings, doesn't matter.
647684	648685	No one gives a crap because...
649281	650142	You're saving the Earth.
650422	651443	So what do I do?
651524	655848	I just start launching random missiles into every single skyscraper I see and watching them all fall.
656089	659593	And it's entertaining because they're there at the next level because there's no continuity whatsoever.
660874	661355	See, that's awesome.
661375	662336	So do you recommend the game?
662476	663397	I highly recommend the game.
664398	664999	Let me tell you.
665620	670842	The frame rate's crap, the graphics suck, the sound is awful, and the voice acting's horrible.
670862	672623	And the AI is pretty retarded as well.
673303	675104	So are you saying it's so bad it's good?
675184	675604	It is.
675684	677705	It's the showgirls of video games?
678105	680166	It's so bad, but that's the thing.
680206	683807	You've got to play it realizing that it's going to suck in these areas.
683867	685828	And to be honest, the graphics don't need to be that great.
685868	687108	It's like an old arcade game.
687468	692510	I mean, old arcade games, there's not that many polygons and stuff, but it works.
692570	693631	It's just fun to play.
694715	695816	It may look like crap.
696657	698218	It may be very fucking hard at times.
698258	707225	The AI can be dumb, because I saw some soldier or whatever that was... I was trying to find these people, so they would join me and help kill the alien ants.
707786	712209	And this guy was shooting a shotgun into a building, because he was stupid and couldn't figure out how to get around the building.
712750	715332	So... That's awesome.
715572	715912	I don't know.
716253	719736	It's just... It's funny, but it's still a lot of fun to play.
719956	720216	It just...
720922	722903	It does not stop getting fun.
723023	725125	So really highly recommend this game.
725485	729267	It's only like $40 for the 360, so definitely worth picking up.
729488	731069	Even if you can find it used, that's even better.
731269	733010	So I recommend it.
733070	734131	It's a lot of fun.
734691	737573	Definitely a lot better than from what I've heard for Armored Core 4.
738273	740355	And other than that, I played Crackdown a little bit.
741996	742656	That's about it, though.
742676	745718	I haven't really... I've been just trying to get the last few achievements and stuff.
746198	750301	Kind of getting a little bored of the game, because now that you're at the end of the game and stuff, there's not much to do.
752627	755028	Oh, and Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, we've been playing that.
755548	761029	At work, we put custom firmwares in all of our PSPs now, so we're all playing it overclocked, which is fun.
761129	762130	It actually looks a lot nicer.
762390	769851	We have a guy that's working this... Actually, he's a pretty famous cheat designer for the Vice City Stories, DurkaDurkaman.
770372	774713	He's working on a multiplayer code to switch out some of the weapons and get some different stuff.
774733	780574	So hopefully that'll happen, and I am so looking forward to this week when the Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer hits on Friday.
780919	782820	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
802676	804397	Only been playing two things.
804877	805797	World of Warcraft.
805977	807758	I made my alternate character.
808178	811499	His name is Agathon and his pet is named Helo.
811719	812719	Oh my gosh, that's awesome.
812759	816000	Because I'm a big Battlestar nerd now because it's so good.
816240	817100	It is so good.
817200	819941	It's the best and Helo's hot.
820641	823822	And then other than that, finally at work.
824465	826966	Thanks for being at a developer place.
827326	833088	I've been playing a lot of Boom Boom Rocket, and it's the best game I've ever played in my life called Boom Boom Rocket.
834048	835369	And it's pretty, and I love it.
835509	836649	I'm not sure how to take that.
836689	838750	It's the best game you've ever played in your life called that.
838770	844652	I could say Big Mother Truckers was the best game I ever played in my life named Big Mother Truckers.
844672	846353	That's a lie, because it wasn't a good game at all.
846992	853297	But Boom Boom Rocket, you know, if I didn't have a 360, would sell me on a 360 because it's really just that much fun.
853357	854057	What the hell is it?
854077	855739	Because I still don't know that much about it.
855939	859461	It's like... Are you allowed to tell us what's... I won't mention specifics.
859521	859982	I don't know.
860142	861002	It's not our game.
861163	861663	I don't care.
861923	862303	All right.
865425	888247	It's a music game with fireworks, so it's like Fantavision meets DDR with a touch of Beatmania, because the fireworks, you know, they make noise for Beatmania, and if you hit arrows when you're not supposed to, it penalizes you like Beatmania does as well, so you can't just mess around, but the track list is not stellar, but it gets the job done, and
889148	893051	If you like Fantavision and you like pretty things, it's really, really fun.
893111	894171	Lots of explosions.
894572	895652	High def, good stuff.
895693	897073	Yeah, oh my goodness.
897354	901356	I don't know, I must have played that a lot this week.
901396	902357	I got all the achievements.
902377	905419	They're all really easy, especially if you play music games.
907420	909242	And it's just a whole lot of fun.
910222	916106	I don't know, it almost convinced somebody at work to get a 360 too, because he was really enjoying it.
916566	918768	Interesting, so the music game fans will be all over this.
921064	927707	Maybe, it depends on if you care about the quality of music you're playing the game to.
927967	930609	Alpha Canogram says it sounds like every Xtend Extra.
931569	932610	No, because this game's good.
933566	935547	I liked every extent extra, whatever.
935887	937928	No, every extent extra.
939088	943009	Music was a part of it, kind of like Rez, but Rez wasn't really a music game.
943089	944530	It's just that music was an important element.
944750	945990	That's what every extent extra is like.
946110	947230	This is a rhythm game.
947631	953092	It's not a game where you blow something up to cause chain reactions.
953292	957254	Every time you hit one of those arrows, fireworks explosions happen.
957614	960755	So, I mean, it's like DDR once you hit 100 combo.
961969	963390	You get a little flashy explosions.
964571	968353	But there's timing issues with the game, too, and I don't think they'll be fixed before.
968733	971775	I'm pretty sure what I was playing is the release candidate.
972255	974837	I just need it to come out now really bad.
975577	975918	That's it.
976578	977198	We'll see what happens.
978699	984723	My gaming week, interestingly enough, I don't know if you were listening last week, but I mentioned I was going to be going on vacation for a little while.
985083	986985	So I have been on vacation the past four days.
987025	990887	In the middle of nowhere, I was up in the Mendocino, Fort Bragg, coastal area, Northern California.
991408	995910	No internet, no phones, no games, really nothing.
996010	998991	So it's just nice to have a break away from everything.
999372	1002553	And I'll get into kind of what effect that's going to have on tonight's show in just a minute.
1003773	1005534	But yeah, so I just took a break.
1005594	1010136	But before I left, I did get to sneak in a little bit of Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live.
1010156	1010877	Oh, man.
1011117	1013378	Oh, my heck, it is awesome.
1013738	1014858	It's so great.
1015359	1018580	I mean, just the fact that, I mean...
1019022	1019502	XBOX LIVE ARCADE
1044636	1045457	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1072963	1075165	Didn't you mention something about no loading times or anything?
1075185	1076206	Oh yeah, there's no loading times.
1076226	1078168	You don't have to wait for anything.
1078248	1080030	They kept all the voice acting intact.
1080350	1080990	It's great.
1081451	1085274	I mean, I definitely recommend, especially if you've never played it before.
1085454	1086075	Oh my gosh.
1086135	1089498	It's got a lot of hours that you can put into the game if you've never played it before.
1089758	1092961	There's no excuse to have never played that game before.
1093501	1094642	Like, I don't care.
1095223	1097045	I'm looking in chatroom.
1097085	1099186	Blaze says, Sky was a hippie for four days, basically.
1099206	1099747	Yeah, basically.
1100273	1101994	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1125208	1127248	But I'll give you my full thoughts on that next week.
1127268	1131029	Because it doesn't seem bad, but it doesn't seem as great as Tetris DS either.
1131169	1132850	And those are just my initial five minute thoughts.
1133010	1134550	But I'll look at it more in depth later.
1134830	1136690	They have like videos playing in the background.
1136770	1138131	The HD videos look pretty hot.
1138831	1145052	But what's kind of interesting though is they also had, you can cheat in it just like you can with the Tetris DS.
1145112	1153374	You can rotate blocks or whatever and then you can actually basically kind of hover them there forever until you decide where you want to put them.
1154354	1154914	That's pretty sweet.
1156295	1158697	I'll give you more thoughts on that next week here on the program.
1182213	1184535	Obviously the live element is an important part of our show.
1184555	1187216	We don't want it to go anywhere, so we suggest you guys all check this out.
1188197	1192960	I know our buddy Travis Donovan went into detail on this on his program on Saturday night.
1193420	1199304	I haven't had a chance to listen to it yet, so if you want to go check him out on iTunes under Travis Donovan, you can check out what he has to say on it.
1200065	1201766	We don't know what we're going to do about this yet.
1201806	1208290	We understand it has changed some rules already on Life 365, which may be kind of a pain in the butt to listen to us on Life 365.
1209250	1211492	Long story short, we don't play enough...
1212754	1213695	and DarkSakura.com.
1233630	1243538	Worst case scenario, if the rates of Live 365 had to go through the roof, we might have to go a couple weeks with no live element, but we would find a new home, set up something on Shoutcast, I don't know.
1243879	1253807	But seeing as Orange Dawn Radio is a bit of a network now, because we have some other great shows like STFU on Thursdays and Travis Donovan on Saturdays, we don't want to lose any of those other shows that we've built up over time.
1253887	1258631	So more to come on that when we have some time to kind of sit down and
1259333	1260954	Take this all in, what's going on with us.
1260974	1264495	Because again, I'm just getting back and hitting all this news.
1265035	1270396	And I want to check out what the rest of our staff has to say about it.
1270456	1270997	So we'll see.
1272817	1282500	Travis Donovan is in chat and says, urges folks to visit Life35.com slash choice and says, you all need to contact your local congressperson and let them know they need to level the playing field again.
1282920	1287181	Over the air radio does not pay royalty rates, but internet and satellite radio must.
1287321	1288822	Doesn't sound very fair to me.
1289389	1295413	and it's going to hurt the little guys like us and other great live 365 and just internet radio stations in general.
1296474	1297355	So that kind of sucks.
1297755	1300017	So we'll have more info on that next week.
1301058	1301398	We'll see.
1302385	1303026	DarkSakura.com
1329099	1330680	PlayStation 3 finally came out for you.
1330720	1332420	That time has finally come.
1333241	1335582	You can finally buy your overpriced gaming machine.
1337263	1340164	And there were some interesting stories coming out about that.
1340264	1342425	Of course, one that pretty much sums everything up.
1342965	1351469	Phil Harrison basically was saying that Europe is the most important continent for the gaming industry.
1351649	1354990	Which is funny because it was also the last one to get the PlayStation 3.
1356051	1358692	But apparently the third is also the most important
1359700	1369166	And he was told, you know, this gameindustry.biz, big industry site, it's got the most countries and it's got the most people.
1369466	1371327	It's also got the most cultures.
1371828	1384135	The fact that we've got the launch here with more consoles shipped on day one than we've ever had in our history is a compliment to the most important market of the world, the European market.
1385876	1389018	I don't know, that sounds a lot of sucking up to me if you ask me, especially since...
1390610	1391110	and DarkSakura.
1414540	1416202	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1429181	1431282	They would have done things a little differently, correct?
1431602	1433343	But oh wait, it doesn't stop there.
1433703	1444867	To prove that point, they even went out of their way to give out free TVs to the first 100 people purchasing the PlayStation 3 at their London launch event.
1444987	1449448	Free 46-inch HD TVs and a free taxi ride home with those.
1449808	1451929	Jesus, that's not a bad deal.
1452129	1453250	Where's my damn TV?
1453310	1453770	I want to know...
1454500	1459244	Wait, wait, the 100 people that sat out in line, like it's incentive to wait in the cold or whatever?
1459424	1460465	Yeah.
1460505	1460685	Huh.
1461266	1465529	So, you know, in the U.S., you know, you have to wait two days to get... And dodge bullets.
1465769	1466910	Yeah, dodge bullets and stuff.
1466930	1470353	Maybe have to race and slam into a pole and get sent to the hospital in a coma.
1470653	1471113	Exactly.
1471153	1475477	And then in the U.K., you get free TVs to go with your gaming systems and stuff.
1476978	1479640	Yeah, Raven's Dolphin in chat says, we get shot, they get TVs.
1479680	1480161	What the fuck?
1480381	1481061	That's a big PR.
1481101	1482663	Is that just because British people are nicer?
1482923	1483463	Or what is that?
1483483	1483784	Maybe.
1483804	1484084	Maybe.
1486502	1489244	Is that to encourage people to actually go outside and wait in line or what?
1489684	1491285	Well, they didn't know that this was going to happen.
1491325	1493927	This was just something that they did.
1494227	1499210	I mean, if they said, hey, by the way, we're going to give away free 46-inch TVs, everyone would have been there.
1500083	1501104	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1518145	1524209	for the media to photograph so they can go, hey, look how popular the PS3 is in Europe even though they had to wait six months for it.
1524229	1524869	Here's the thing, though.
1524889	1528511	If they did something like that, they'd be like, yeah, but it's only because you're giving away free TVs.
1528551	1532614	I mean, it's not because of the PlayStation 3 and they would have just spun it that way.
1533254	1535535	I think this is just kissing ass.
1535595	1536896	It's a whole lot of kissing ass.
1536916	1542159	It's like, please don't be mad at us that we waited so long and you have to pay more for a system that actually does less.
1543280	1543840	Please don't be mad.
1544240	1544801	Fire games.
1544841	1546842	Joshi16 says, Sony was eating crayons.
1547742	1552203	They weren't eating crayons, they were just kissing ass, that's all it was.
1552303	1560886	Now, GS68 says it doesn't free stuff bundles with something up the price, but you're saying these are absolutely free TVs that they gave away to the first... Absolutely free.
1561146	1562886	At, like, one particular London store?
1563347	1571529	I think so, it was where they were doing their launch event, where the Sony president would be handing out the first PS3 type thing, you know, something like that, so...
1572441	1576964	Sony withheld the release of the PlayStation 3 in order to build up stock levels for the launch.
1601457	1607099	A situation where the Xbox 360 was terrible and the Wii doesn't even hit the sides when it comes in.
1608239	1612100	It says, I think this is a very good move on Sony's part.
1612120	1616161	It won't have that negativity of not being able to supply enough units.
1617601	1619822	So that's good that they're able to supply enough units.
1619942	1622743	I don't know if that's really an issue, though.
1622763	1625424	I mean, I think the demand's just less for it.
1625524	1628364	Cool.
1628744	1630745	Cool that they have enough units out there.
1631678	1641940	Unfortunately, though, and it kind of gets into that whole demand thing, outside of the launch event, it wasn't so pretty for Sony.
1642320	1647481	In fact, there was a few situations where you only had a few people lining up for the system, and no one cared.
1649242	1659104	For example, Virgin Megastore, they had some campers outside, but it was really only about three or so people that were waiting in line for the system.
1660152	1686820	and a lot of other stores you know there were some situations where they're breaking street in Italy and stuff like that and there's also stuff where people were just not coming in pre-ordering or even buying the system at all so a lot of people said who cares at this point I don't know so it's kind of negative a little bit what do you think made the UK folks not want to line up for it do you think it was because of what happened over here do you think maybe they just don't
1687170	1688191	Get Excited Like This
1718632	1720953	And I think it's a little bit what Shane said, maybe not so harsh.
1721193	1723314	It's not a lot of games out there right now.
1723634	1726255	Not a lot of exclusive stuff that's really, you know, must-have.
1726415	1729836	I mean, it's really one of those systems that, okay, maybe it's better off to wait.
1730117	1732518	When the price comes down a little bit and there's more of a library.
1732898	1734838	Also, they were kind of getting shafted for a while.
1734878	1737820	A lot of people that were waiting, you know, the six months or whatever.
1738180	1738680	Not six months.
1739685	1761479	4 months, 3 months, you know, to get the system, probably like say, hey, you know what, maybe 360 is a little bit better, maybe I should just pick this up now, because I can get it now, and there's a big library of games out there, or get the Wii, and then just, making them wait for a while, if they're really itching to get, you know, their grasp of the new game systems, they're just going to go someplace else and get something that's out now.
1762119	1768423	So, I don't know, they're really having a hard time distinguishing themselves as why you need this system.
1769989	1770889	So that's one thing.
1772070	1776191	And UK wasn't the only problem with... They didn't have the only problems with launches.
1776812	1779373	Australia, the launch wasn't very great over there.
1779453	1785095	In fact, their launch event only drew about... I want to say like 40 people is what I was reading.
1785315	1792058	I had read that a lot of these launch events were getting cancelled because of the fear of gunshots and all the crap that happened here.
1792978	1797980	I didn't hear too many of that, but I know the ones that they were talking about in Australia...
1798776	1810023	They had about maybe 40 people show up, another 30 that were press, and it was pretty much like kind of, I don't know, just people weren't really excited about it.
1810203	1816466	I don't know if it's just because not a lot of people were pre-ordering them or just no one really wanted them.
1816907	1819048	Rice Princess, you had one comment earlier but got cut off.
1819208	1820309	What did you want to say about all this?
1820329	1822810	I was just going to say they're all busy playing Wii Bowling.
1824651	1827713	They're too busy to go stand out in line and wait for a Sony because they're all busy playing Wii Bowling.
1828049	1828989	Because they're playing Wii Bowling.
1829049	1830710	Okay, I got you.
1830870	1831890	Would you have camped out for this?
1832430	1832531	No.
1832971	1833291	Why not?
1834671	1835532	Let's say you had the money.
1836072	1838953	Let's say you had 600 euros, dollars, whatever right now.
1839313	1840373	Would you go camp out?
1840613	1845235	No, because I probably already have a Wii, and I don't have a desire to have a PS3.
1845275	1846515	I'd be spending my time on the Wii.
1846755	1847436	I got a question for you.
1847456	1850717	You've been very vocal about your hate for Xbox on this show previously.
1851057	1854078	Would you buy an Xbox at this point before a PlayStation 3, Xbox 360?
1854358	1857499	If I had... Okay, in terms of if I had to...
1857964	1858764	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1881570	1882410	Yes, I like the 360.
1882811	1886232	I seem to recall, though, on this program, you were very excited about the Wii.
1886352	1886813	I was.
1886873	1888493	So when did this change in heart happen?
1888773	1893015	Well, it was when Nintendo decided that they were too good to release games anymore.
1893736	1897237	And I don't want to play crappy games, and that's all they've been giving us lately.
1897398	1899819	You do this all the time, though, to be fair.
1900639	1904241	I distinctly remember you sold your Xbox 360 back for the same reason.
1905862	1907202	How many PS2s have I had?
1907282	1910884	When Final Fantasy XI came out, you bought a new one eventually because you were like,
1911266	1913127	Ooh, I have to be a Corsair because they're pretty.
1913687	1915808	I mean, have you sold your Wii back at this point?
1915969	1920731	No, but my Wii has been broken since I got it, and I have my little return sticker for Nintendo.
1920751	1922212	I need to call and get a new one, actually.
1922652	1927835	But I have no desire to send it back because, like, what am I going to play on it right now?
1927935	1928956	I've never finished Zelda.
1929036	1930477	I mean, seriously, you can sell it.
1930517	1934140	They're going for a lot of money right now because they can't find them and people want them.
1934701	1936502	So if you don't want yours, might as well sell it.
1936542	1939345	But at the end of the year, you're going to get your Mario Galaxy, your Metroid.
1939365	1940346	You're going to want one anyway.
1940426	1942688	I have no desire for Mario Galaxy, thanks to Sunshine.
1942708	1943468	But Metroid, yeah.
1943809	1944649	Smash Bros., yeah.
1945030	1946491	Maybe they'll have another color by then.
1946511	1947832	I'm a color whore anyway.
1948273	1949213	That's true.
1949594	1950975	I want something you'll talk about later.
1952917	1953137	Let's see.
1953157	1953717	Let's see.
1956397	1962740	Joshi16 says the exact same thing happened on the DS, don't act surprised Blaze says die Miklatov die
1979451	1980252	You can die too.
1980712	1987297	DarkTetsuya says, Miklatov's Wii's been broken, which Sakuramax follows right up with, Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
1987837	1990879	That's creepy, and so quit talking, please.
1992080	1996723	For the record, if you listened to last week's program, I was all excited about playing Cooking Mama this week.
1996984	2002207	I went to Toys R Us today to try to get it when I bought Tetris, because I had something to take back, so I had a credit there anyway.
2002568	2004069	And they told me it didn't come out until next week.
2005089	2006611	It came out last week.
2007151	2007651	They're retarded.
2007671	2008532	So Toys R Us lied to me.
2009008	2012269	Yeah, they have old information or their shipments didn't come in.
2012769	2013129	Bitch!
2015450	2017130	It was not something that was delayed.
2018351	2019011	It's been out there.
2019031	2020911	I've heard the game's been in crap reviews anyway.
2020951	2021812	I'm a little worried.
2022492	2025833	I saw a blockbuster yesterday, so I know it's out there.
2026593	2027453	I don't know.
2028874	2031094	Mama needs to fix her shipping dates.
2031114	2031914	That's what she needs to fix.
2031954	2033415	I'm like, I'm not even going to rent this.
2034475	2035015	No thank you.
2035035	2035795	Well, I'm going to buy it.
2035855	2037596	You know I'm going to buy it because I'm dumb.
2039264	2040405	Cookin' Mama on the Wii.
2040445	2041645	Oh my god, that looks so great, I want it.
2041705	2043506	But it's been getting negative reviews everywhere.
2043786	2045687	It looks great, but it controls like crap.
2046147	2047328	Why would you be excited for it?
2047368	2048929	Because you're a woman and you do that already.
2050669	2051850	But not on a DS.
2052270	2052650	It's a Wii.
2052710	2053911	On a Wii, stupid!
2054371	2055712	Or on a Wii, shut up.
2055812	2062815	It's really disappointing that it controls like crap, because I mean, I was hoping that it would be, it looked fun, and the DS one looked fun too, it's just,
2063584	2067105	Well, there were some control issues, and really, that frustrates the hell out of you.
2067385	2068286	More comments from chat.
2068306	2071687	I'm really relying on chat tonight, because I have not been reading the internet this week.
2071887	2074368	Zappy says, the original Cookie Mama got bad reviews, too.
2074928	2076129	Because it had control issues.
2076609	2077769	It has control issues.
2078069	2078529	Let's see.
2079930	2084071	Skylark makes a good point and says, luckily, Super Paper Mario comes out in a few weeks.
2085772	2085952	What?
2085992	2088173	You're booing Super Paper Mario, Mikotov?
2088931	2089572	The crap!
2089712	2091013	What's wrong with Super Paper Mario?
2091033	2091793	It looks great!
2092294	2098239	Um, I don't like it because it is a Paper Mario title, and I don't like Paper Mario games.
2098279	2103903	I know it's a frickin' platformer game, but I'm sick of platformers, and I hate everything.
2104064	2105465	So, there.
2106225	2108007	Wait, you heard about the Power Rangers game that's coming out?
2108467	2109068	Just kidding!
2110529	2110969	I gotcha.
2110989	2111249	Sucker!
2114810	2117071	Blaze wanted to point out Miklatov just won my love back.
2117352	2117672	LOL.
2118012	2119713	No one makes Power Ranger games anymore.
2119793	2120574	I don't know what he didn't say.
2121054	2122955	And GS68 says Cooking Milf.
2123816	2124736	Maybe that'll be the sequel.
2124857	2125417	Cooking Milf.
2126458	2127178	That's wrong.
2128819	2134183	Something else that's wrong is removing the emotion engine out of the PlayStation 3 to cut down costs.
2134683	2136384	Granted, okay, I will give them this.
2136564	2138766	It does now, they have with the new...
2139699	2140920	V1.6 firmware.
2141481	2146726	The original PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games are emulated now with software emulation instead of hardware.
2146746	2151290	Of the 2,451 PlayStation 2 titles in the European region, only 1,782 titles work.
2162873	2165615	Which, to be honest though, that's a lot better than the 360.
2165675	2168457	That is a lot better than the 360.
2168517	2171319	Of course, you know, what does that really mean?
2171339	2176323	I mean, because that's a lot of titles, but maybe it's a lot of, you know, Barbie Horse Adventures type stuff.
2176663	2179665	I mean, really, how much of this stuff am I going to want to play?
2179765	2183408	And which games, you know, are working, not working, etc.
2184169	2190213	And I'm trying to remember here, I want to say of the list that they are saying that
2190934	2191615	weren't working.
2191755	2198123	I want to see Final Fantasy 7, Resident Evil 2, Ratchet and Clank, Metal Gear Solid 2.
2198203	2200967	Those are some of the PS1 games that weren't working.
2201788	2205733	And, um, let's see, uh, big name issue, or there was, um,
2207346	2211107	550 of the games that had noticeable issues, according to Sony.
2211628	2220991	Among the big-name titles like Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider 2 on the PlayStation 1, Final Fantasy X, Kingdom Hearts, SingStar, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas on the PlayStation 2.
2223252	2224512	Those are all ones that didn't work?
2224552	2226593	Those are all ones that had noticeable issues.
2227013	2228193	Oh, lame.
2228733	2230434	Okay, to be fair, to be fair, though,
2231408	2240292	A thousand... You know, 1,700 titles for your system that are backwards compatible, a lot better than over 300, you know, for the 360, so... Yeah, I guess that's true.
2240773	2243594	I mean, they're working on it, so give them some credit.
2243614	2252759	That's a lot more than I was expecting to work with the system, so... They're doing something right, at least, but I still think it's kind of crappy that it's, you know, software emulation now.
2252919	2253439	Who cares, though?
2253459	2257161	I have one of the original PlayStation 3s, and it plays it on hardware emulation, so...
2258160	2258680	Who cares?
2258700	2259380	Pardon me for a minute.
2259420	2261801	I have a sidebar issue completely unrelated to take care of.
2262141	2267802	Why is it when I got up to sneak to go use the bathroom, the magic of radio, I can get up and leave and you don't even know?
2268722	2274303	But yet I noticed in chat I suddenly said, I'm Rob, I'm so flamey, blah, blah, blah.
2276043	2276943	Wow, Rob, you're amazing.
2277003	2278944	I'm going to let you take a guess who said that.
2279064	2281124	Yeah, it was probably Miklatov.
2282364	2283504	You're probably right.
2283524	2285145	They're pointing back and forth at each other.
2285165	2286805	You guys are jerks.
2287369	2287849	Hey, man.
2287869	2288929	Banned from the show forever.
2289509	2289710	Aw.
2289990	2291850	Wah, wah, wah.
2292030	2292670	It was funny, though.
2292710	2300352	So, with the PlayStation 1.6 firmware for the PlayStation 3, you got some other stuff.
2300892	2303193	Not just, you know, some backwards compatibility vehicle.
2303213	2303633	Wait, hold on.
2303653	2305633	I want to comment on the whole backwards compatibility thing.
2305673	2306533	Yeah.
2306813	2307214	It sucks.
2307934	2308214	That's all.
2309074	2309234	Yeah.
2309838	2310699	Well, here's the thing.
2310719	2311560	What else is there to say?
2311580	2313441	I don't know.
2313641	2314182	It's weird.
2314562	2326051	But at the same time, I do feel like, okay, if you're going to buy a PlayStation 3... You know, I called into All Games Radio very randomly on Tuesday or Wednesday, one of the days before I leave, to talk about this, and I kind of made a little joke.
2326432	2328133	Because, I don't know, they were doing something on there.
2328353	2332757	They were joking that the whole cast of OLR was at the Sony factory doing backwards compatibility.
2333217	2333698	Don't ask.
2333738	2335319	I don't remember what it was.
2335719	2337661	So I called in pretending to be at the Sony factory.
2337681	2338822	I made this little joke about...
2339645	2346231	If you're going to buy a PlayStation 3 to play all your old PlayStation 2 games, maybe you ought to save $400 and buy a PlayStation 2.
2347192	2347453	Right?
2347553	2348053	Fair?
2348133	2348414	Yeah.
2348894	2349635	So I don't know why.
2350391	2374723	at one point I do want to go well that kind of sucks you can't play all your old games but seeing as the system doesn't really upscale it yet like it was supposed to right they don't actually the software emulation will allow it to upscale so that is good but it's not that big a deal it's not that big a deal it's not going to suddenly make your games HD beautiful blah blah blah it's just going to be like a little bit smoother honestly ask yourself I mean really if you've got a Playstation 3
2375723	2378828	and you're really gearing to play some next-gen games.
2379068	2381071	Are you really playing PlayStation 1 games?
2381712	2382092	I'm not.
2382192	2383454	I have PlayStation 2 games.
2383654	2385156	I have a PlayStation 2 as well.
2385657	2386578	I don't touch the thing.
2386779	2388000	I don't play any of those games.
2388180	2389142	I'm playing new stuff.
2389422	2392787	If I really want to go back and play Kingdom Hearts 2 or whatever...
2393167	2394409	I'll play it on my PlayStation 2.
2395270	2397794	I mean... I mean, PlayStation 2s are still selling really well.
2397934	2398475	Exactly.
2398716	2402161	And they're sort of readily available out there.
2402201	2407388	I mean, and they're not that expensive and they'll probably drop in price again once we get down to Christmas time again.
2408089	2408270	So...
2409099	2416261	At the same time, though, I do get a little irritated when Xbox 360 talks about how they're going to abandon pretty much the old Xbox stuff come 2008.
2416301	2417461	I think we had a story on that last week.
2417761	2420802	And I know people go, well, just play it on your old Xbox, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2421162	2422502	But I don't know.
2422562	2423683	Sometimes I don't feel like cooking.
2423703	2426423	I only have so much room in my living room for so many game systems.
2426903	2429944	So it is kind of convenient sometimes to be able to do the backwards compatibility thing.
2430064	2433165	And it's a nice thing that they've added since, I think, was it?
2433906	2436588	Um, the PlayStation 2 was the first system to actually do that.
2436608	2437649	And it was a great selling point.
2437669	2440471	You know, all your PlayStation 1 games actually makes them run a little bit better.
2441072	2444094	Um, you can do better graphics or, you know, better load times.
2444414	2445315	So that was kind of cool.
2445555	2450499	Which I might add, PlayStation 1 load times, or PlayStation 3 load times kind of suck on certain games.
2450700	2451260	Ghetto.
2451280	2453782	Um, they should allow to all install the hard drive.
2453802	2454463	That'd be really nice.
2454803	2455824	But either way, um,
2457020	2462883	It's still, it's not, I would say though, 1700 games working for your system is a lot better than 300.
2463283	2465024	Okay, that's something that they've got.
2465064	2468325	But the Xbox did not have as big of a library as the PlayStation 2.
2468365	2468626	True.
2468766	2472247	Because they didn't have anything before Xbox.
2472547	2472768	True.
2472808	2474288	Microsoft didn't compete with PlayStation 1.
2475249	2483933	And really, I'm hoping that they do stick on, you know, they really concentrate on the backwards compatibility instead of just saying, ah, fuck it, you know, we got this made to work, so.
2485216	2485537	That's it.
2486057	2486418	We're done.
2486698	2487079	Good enough.
2487479	2494370	SSJ100Matt says, It's funny that Microsoft killed the Xbox One right away, and PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 are still around.
2494450	2500239	I don't know so much about PlayStation 1, but certainly PlayStation 2's still got quite a bit of life, it seems, left in it.
2500529	2505290	I don't know if God of War 2 is like its last gasp of air or if that's going to be the last big game.
2505310	2509912	That may be the last Sony game, but they're still making games throughout the year.
2509952	2511092	They're coming out for the PlayStation 2.
2511152	2514913	And I'm sure we'll get Sudoku Master for years to come on PlayStation 2.
2515533	2516774	I played a lot of Sudoku.
2517114	2520095	When you don't have a PSP or a DS, it's all about Sudoku.
2520315	2521435	It's cheap to develop for.
2521455	2521935	That's what it is.
2522075	2523756	It's the one system that has...
2524192	2524372	and so on.
2549102	2549583	and so on.
2572482	2576344	Let me quickly go to another sidebar comment, then we get back into the news here.
2577565	2579826	The comments in the chatroom, this is an interesting conversation.
2579887	2584089	Jvmon says, if you have a PlayStation 3, why the hell are you still playing Final Fantasy VII?
2584489	2589132	And then ShadowNextGen says, Jvmon, Final Fantasy VII is a classic that I will always play.
2590310	2611782	and then moving on let's see JV Mon says then play it on your PlayStation 2 and Hippolytus says this he says I for example never owned a PlayStation I think he means PS1 but now that I have a PlayStation 2 I can play PlayStation 1 games but that begs the comment how many people do you know that's actually you're going to go get a PlayStation 3 who never had a PlayStation 2
2612549	2614030	But I do know of one person.
2614110	2619212	I do have a friend who's considering getting a PlayStation 3 and he never had a PlayStation 2 or a PlayStation 1.
2619372	2622513	He's thinking about getting it because he can play all the backwards compatible stuff.
2622553	2623654	In this country, you still can.
2623834	2627095	If this is a big concern for them, I would recommend that they do.
2627575	2635599	And this is going to be a different SKU or slightly different item, not item number, like, you know, their Sony item numbers or whatever.
2635859	2640061	Either way, you're going to be able to look on the box and tell which version of the PlayStation 3 this is.
2640101	2640801	The one that has...
2641408	2641989	and DarkSakura.com
2671434	2673756	But the thing is that it's going to come at a cost.
2673776	2678180	You're not going to have that chip on there, and they've already said they're going to take it out for the U.S.
2678300	2678460	ones.
2678580	2682464	So if it's a real big deal for you, maybe spend the extra money.
2682744	2685586	I mean, it's either that or you're going to spend another $99 on a PlayStation 2.
2686687	2688589	So pick your poison.
2688629	2692312	I mean, this way you get a larger hard drive with it at the same time.
2692913	2695135	You can buy a more expensive system or something.
2695155	2696556	I don't know.
2698231	2703794	Anyways, so back to the PlayStation 3 1.6 firmware that's out there.
2704414	2712679	Finally, they've added background downloading, something that they should have had from the beginning because this thing downloads, like, fucking slow.
2713659	2715980	Well, to be fair, 360 didn't have it at first either.
2716000	2716440	Exactly.
2716501	2717601	It badly needed it, too.
2717681	2722964	But I would have hoped that since, you know, the PlayStation 3 came out a year later that they would kind of learn from it.
2722984	2723444	I'll give you that.
2723644	2724965	Learn from their mistakes, so...
2725757	2739228	Either way, so now it does work and it is confirmed that it will work while you're watching a Blu-ray movie or playing an offline game, non-online game, just like basically the same rules as a 360, so that's kind of cool.
2740289	2744533	Another thing, well, and also kind of another thing, why would you really need background downloading?
2744553	2747035	Because there's not a lot to download on the store right now.
2747575	2748216	So, anyways.
2749257	2754161	Another thing that does add, and this is kind of neat, is that folding at home
2755041	2763785	That basically the kind of program that runs in the background to help crunch numbers to figure out how to come up with cures for diseases and whatnot.
2764346	2778192	Interesting enough, this was released this week, the firmware update, and already the PlayStation 3 is processing a lot more numbers than anything else.
2778412	2781754	In fact, even more than most of the Windows PCs out there.
2783035	2801805	Right now they are currently doing 251 teraflops, which is $100 trillion more than... They were saying that the PlayStation 3 machines are delivering over 251 trillion floating point operations per second.
2802606	2806828	$100 trillion more than 10 times the number of active PC CPUs.
2807811	2820719	Is this folding at home thing, and forgive my ignorance a little bit because I don't have a PlayStation 3, so I'm not really following this very much, but is this something that you automatically kind of stealth installs in your PlayStation 3 and just runs without you knowing it?
2820759	2826383	I think you have to download this, or it's basically a, I'm not sure if it's included with the update.
2826563	2828644	If it is included with the update, it's a program you have to run.
2828764	2831866	It runs almost like a screensaver, and it will crunch numbers automatically.
2833247	2837991	But yeah, for a PC, you would have to elect to download this and kind of seek it out, right?
2838332	2842656	Yes, but the thing is, though, you have to run it in order for it to actually run.
2842696	2844417	It's not something that will run automatically.
2846199	2848981	Kind of like distributed net, because I used to run that back in college.
2849061	2850002	It's like that.
2850082	2852705	It's basically like the old SETI at home, stuff like that.
2852725	2854306	A little cow icon.
2854806	2859931	Except now, instead of searching for extraterrestrial life, because I guess they gave up on that.
2861151	2865014	Instead of that, they're looking to, you know, cure cancer.
2865694	2872659	Because I can't wait for the press release when one of these PlayStation 3s happens to crunch the magical number to cure cancer.
2873340	2874701	Sony cures cancer.
2874821	2877203	I mean, I can see that PR right now.
2878103	2882507	Joshi16 in chat says, Cure cancer, 1,000 gamer points, and a home trophy.
2882807	2883167	There you go.
2884228	2885629	Yeah, I want the cure cancer trophy.
2886349	2886850	Anyways...
2887819	2890641	Onto a completely different system and subject.
2891602	2895704	This rumor of the black Xbox 360 just will never die.
2896405	2898526	And it's now confirmed to be real.
2899166	2900607	Probably why the rumor never died.
2901128	2911815	But in the latest issue of Game Informer Magazine... Which further goes to show Microsoft rumors 90% of the time, unless you made it up yourself, Microsoft rumors are always true.
2913436	2913836	Always true.
2916091	2922354	It has been announced, at least according to the article in Game Informer, not officially announced yet, but anyways.
2923155	2929838	An HDMI-enabled black unit is coming out for $479.
2929978	2932419	It's going to be a limited edition in black.
2932719	2933860	It will be in white later.
2934260	2936181	But limited edition for $479.
2936581	2937721	And it's supposed to have a larger hard drive, 120 GB.
2944134	2953356	and other rumored options with this is that it's supposed to also have black accessories coming out for it, so eventually you'll see different colored controllers and whatnot.
2954056	2960838	And one thing also they're talking about is the IPTV is supposed to be enabled in it as well.
2961338	2962458	So that's something interesting.
2962798	2970400	If you've already spent the money, though, on your 360, you'll be happy to know there will be a larger hard drive coming out for under $200.
2971904	2983293	and the other rumor with that is that there is going to be a data cable included with the new 360 and the new hard drive that will allow you to be able to hook up your old hard drive to transfer any saves you have.
2983473	2985395	So I hope that's true.
2987596	2990899	Well, Microsoft rumors usually end up being true, so it would make sense.
2990999	2992600	But interesting.
2993201	2994021	But I don't know.
2994081	2999946	I can't get too excited about the black Xbox 360 because I think, well, the first Xbox was black and nobody cared.
3000560	3002481	Well, it's going to be called the Elite.
3002881	3004821	I mean, that's what they're calling it right now.
3005202	3008063	The Core system's not going away.
3008483	3010163	The Premium system's not going away.
3010303	3016805	It's basically, this is just going to be another SKU that's added on, and eventually it will become a white system.
3016885	3023048	I'm not sure if it's going to replace the Premium system or not, but they're going to eventually all be white.
3025688	3026009	I don't know.
3026229	3026889	It's interesting.
3027969	3030050	Hopefully we'll see a price drop for the Core, because that'd be kind of nice.
3031556	3032817	I heard they're ditching the core.
3033617	3033997	I don't know.
3034298	3039800	I would think they would because they want to urge people to download movies and stuff, so that means you have to have a hard drive, right?
3040340	3043902	Yeah, but at the same time, they want to still be able to compete against the Wii and stuff.
3044242	3046303	I mean, they've got to have that lower price point out there.
3046603	3048684	Drop the premium to $2.99, there you go.
3050165	3051325	Yeah, that would be good.
3052186	3053867	I think if they do price drop to drop it to $2.99...
3055595	3059019	They could keep the core around for $199 or something like that.
3059339	3063323	If they're not going to keep it around, then so be it.
3063423	3065686	So they'll have a unit that's not out there.
3066326	3069610	ShadowNextGen says, New Xbox 360 hard drive for under $200 equals $199.99.
3073407	3082970	If I were to guess, actually, I can't remember, because originally the core system, it was $299, and the hard drive is $99, so that would equal $399, roughly.
3083051	3083731	This is $479, so...
3091579	3091959	I don't know.
3092639	3094180	Core system plus new hard drive.
3094280	3095540	I'm guessing the hard drive is $179.99.
3095580	3099341	That would be my guess.
3099841	3103582	Blaze says, Sky, new colors always make people go, ooh.
3103982	3104322	I don't know.
3104342	3114025	I kind of like the white because, you know, for my setup, it's kind of nice because my, you know, Ikea TV table is a light color and then you have the white Wii on one side and the white Xbox 360 on the other side.
3114425	3115225	Everything looks nice.
3115285	3119806	Rob, you got to understand, though, people are stupid and they will buy different colored stuff because...
3120046	3123327	I can understand for the HDMI cable, the big hard drive and that stuff.
3123347	3124727	Maybe, I don't know.
3125888	3126668	I'm not going to get it.
3127328	3128228	Yeah, I'm not going to get it.
3128268	3131709	I might get the new hard drive or something if I really need it or something.
3132189	3133910	But I don't need the HDMI.
3133930	3136250	My TV doesn't have HDMI, so that's a big deal.
3137350	3142072	Black, I couldn't give a crap if the thing was bright green or pink or something.
3143152	3143512	Who cares?
3144905	3148387	Raven's Dolphin wants to know if you've seen this through your insider sources.
3148447	3148687	Nope.
3149187	3153950	Because certain companies will not talk about stuff before it needs to be out there.
3154190	3158693	Certain companies are a little better about keeping tabs on that stuff than others.
3158793	3166799	Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony, they're an expert in the PR department and they will not leak crap like this out there.
3166879	3170001	In fact, I'm surprised that it would even be out there in some of those systems stuff.
3170021	3171902	Unless they're doing like test stuff, I don't know.
3171942	3173583	But yeah, this stuff...
3174093	3174874	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3204443	3206304	So, I don't know.
3206905	3209546	That might be good to boost stock prices or something.
3210307	3215310	Anyways, on to the final new system out there, the Wii.
3216270	3220973	They are getting the final version of the internet channel towards the end of April.
3221994	3223415	And it's supposed to be...
3225613	3227354	having some more features added to it.
3227494	3231556	I believe they're improving the... Like getting rid of that goddamn bar that sits at the bottom of your page?
3232816	3233417	I hope so.
3233617	3234137	I can't remember.
3234157	3240920	I have to find the exact details for it, but I remember improved zooming, auto-resizing of text.
3241760	3248823	I think they're improving the little virtual keyboard that's on there so that it has some more preset stuff like www.
3249223	3250504	and HTML and stuff like that.
3251625	3252585	So that stuff on there.
3253464	3256326	Hopefully they're removing the little bar on there.
3256346	3263351	And I think they're extending the free web browser until June now.
3263691	3267594	Well, that's a nice thing to do considering a lot of people that want to get Wii still can't get them.
3268434	3268655	Yeah.
3268675	3268955	You know?
3269855	3271777	And really, I mean, the web browser is five bucks.
3271797	3275599	I mean, when it does eventually, you know, when they start charging for it.
3276920	3277220	I don't know.
3277701	3279222	I can't see how that would be.
3281423	3287365	You know, the Wii web browser has been getting a little bit of play in this house because we use it for YouTube.
3288205	3291766	You know, when there's like seven people over, we want to show something funny on YouTube.
3291806	3295747	Like, hey, look at this Kelly video on YouTube because you're the only person on the planet that still hasn't seen it.
3296147	3303049	We'll go to YouTube and bring it up on the TV and it's kind of cool except for that bar that sits at the bottom of the page and kind of eats up all the space.
3304009	3304949	Or Pornotube.
3305362	3306382	or PornoTube.
3306422	3307583	I remember the New Year's party.
3307623	3310484	Good times.
3311364	3313225	Yes, it's the gateway to porn.
3315246	3319027	Anyways, back on the subject of the Wii here.
3319588	3323189	EA announced a brand new game for the Wii called Boogie.
3323989	3325870	I think we had covered a story.
3326430	3330212	They were talking about how there was going to be a 70s style music game coming out for the Wii.
3330979	3331981	and I believe this is it.
3332622	3334806	Is this the Harmonix partnership?
3335247	3335488	No.
3335948	3336049	Oh.
3336409	3338273	Because there's that going on too, right?
3338633	3343222	I seem to remember last week there was some sort of, from Game Developers Conference, EA said...
3343663	3346865	We're gonna get in bed with Harmonix for one game type thing going on.
3347206	3348026	Is this related?
3348247	3350708	I don't think this has anything to do with Harmonix.
3350829	3351509	Alright.
3351689	3352210	Just curious.
3352230	3358755	It's basically a Wii exclusive game and you're gonna be using the nunchuck as well as the remotes to disco dance.
3358935	3366581	And your character kind of looks almost like, I don't know, definitely not human, but there's these evil looking Pikmin things in the background.
3366601	3368102	Everybody disco dancing!
3368642	3370684	So it's interesting what they're doing with that.
3371504	3372145	Could be kind of fun.
3372625	3372925	I don't know.
3373326	3373486	So.
3375370	3377292	I'm looking forward to it.
3377312	3381555	That should be out later this year, of course, no specific anything on that.
3381575	3382816	Yeah, it's still a little vague for me.
3382836	3386759	I want to know more about, like, you know, are there videos out there of people playing it?
3386779	3387000	Pictures.
3387400	3387820	Pictures?
3387880	3389161	Pictures of the game.
3389221	3389762	Looks pretty good.
3390522	3402192	Another thing that was announced, or at least reconfirmed, Guitar Hero for the Wii is supposed to be coming out, and they're saying that they're going to actually be doing controllers as well that look like guitars.
3402332	3403073	Not a big surprise.
3403813	3404394	And, um,
3405816	3411440	Yeah, it's kind of going back to when they were talking about... Wait, they're going to make controllers that look like guitars?
3412040	3412901	That's what they were saying.
3412941	3416803	But wouldn't that be a given because Guitar Hero uses a guitar controller?
3416823	3421106	Or are they saying that feasibly you're going to be able to play this game with no special controller?
3421446	3423248	I think they're actually making new controllers for it.
3423988	3424208	Huh.
3424228	3424348	Yeah.
3427474	3431677	It says the cult rhythm game Guitar Hero is on its way to the Wii.
3431697	3436841	It comes with a guitar-shaped controller and plays convincingly enough to make you think you're making real music.
3437241	3441685	Hopefully we'll get the actual guitar and not pretend we're... Ah, so it's speculation.
3441745	3442245	Never mind.
3444226	3446908	So no idea if they're going to actually have a real guitar thing.
3447268	3448229	I would hope that they're going to.
3448489	3453733	If they want to cut costs, just make a plug-in for the Wii Remote.
3454053	3454874	Stick it in there and...
3455771	3461335	I don't know what the Wii version is going to have to really have something special to make me want to buy another guitar controller.
3485905	3491752	and another, you know, I kind of wish they would put out a guitar that would just work on all the systems, kind of like you can get DDR pads to do that.
3491952	3492192	Yeah.
3492733	3493153	I'll be nice.
3495055	3496016	Then let's see here.
3496036	3501703	I have one more story, and I think you talked about this a little bit last week, Rob, and it's been finally confirmed.
3501843	3507329	A Nintendo rep has confirmed individual friends lists for the Wii titles.
3507990	3532675	So yes, they have worked they have done nothing to change the fucking hassle that was DS friends list system and basically they've said I can confirm that the friend code system in the Wi-Fi connection service for the Wii will be the same as it was for the Nintendo DS meaning game specific friend codes and separate friends rosters are used in each game where players can play with identified friends.
3533095	3537716	As with the Nintendo DS, the system was created to ensure gaming environment is kept
3538331	3539431	Fun for everyone.
3540352	3544293	Except for the people that have to enter in the 5,000 codes for each damn game.
3546433	3547054	Retarded.
3547394	3549894	I just... I don't know.
3549934	3551495	I talked about this so I was blue in the face last night.
3551535	3552935	I just don't get it.
3553515	3554976	What do you... You weren't here last week.
3554996	3557156	What do you think of this whole friend codes thing on the Wii?
3557536	3561198	That you're going to have to basically enter in your friend code every time to get new players.
3561918	3562098	What?
3562178	3562698	That's dumb.
3563598	3564679	Like you do on the DS, right?
3564719	3565540	You know how you do that on the DS?
3565560	3566100	You enter a friend code.
3566120	3567541	Now you're going to have to do the same thing on the Wii.
3567662	3572346	Even though we already put in friend codes to send the messages back and forth on it, you're going to have to do it for every single game.
3572366	3577810	Because heaven forbid you get a, I don't know, a predator on Wii or something.
3578111	3584156	I hope that this is something that's not required for third parties or something.
3584356	3584977	This could be fun.
3585457	3588580	I'm fine with the first party stuff if they want to do that.
3589244	3595866	Great, but so far with Konami, they have Elebits and WeConnect24 stuff.
3596206	3598047	I don't know.
3598127	3600907	I guess that's not really playing with anyone online, though.
3600927	3603568	That's just exchanging levels or something.
3603588	3607629	I still think it's retarded, though.
3608509	3611070	Why would you want to be a friend in one game and not another?
3611890	3612211	Why?
3612371	3613451	It doesn't make any sense.
3614626	3615687	No sense whatsoever.
3615967	3618890	I don't understand why they have to complicate things.
3619550	3624894	I'm sure they got an over, you know, what was the response to the DS one?
3624934	3627917	I mean, no one I think actually was positive on it.
3627977	3629458	Everyone was like, this fucking sucks.
3629998	3634862	So what would make you decide, hmm, people really hated it before, let's do it again.
3635022	3635983	That'd be awesome.
3636583	3638945	I mean, really, what was the thought behind this?
3639345	3639926	I don't get it.
3640595	3641736	Maybe there wasn't any thought.
3641876	3645398	I mean, people aren't really being kidnapped with the goddamn DS.
3645558	3646579	I mean, seriously.
3647499	3649461	Skylark says, friend codes are horrible.
3649541	3651022	Hasn't Nintendo learned anything?
3651442	3654984	I'd rather take the risk of meeting child molesters than not be able to play online at all.
3656765	3659887	And really, how hard is it anyways to add someone?
3659947	3661428	I mean, you just put in a friend code.
3661468	3664530	It's basically like accepting, like hitting yes or something.
3664550	3667252	I mean, people, they won't.
3667882	3671583	People can add you to their friends list, but you have to add them back first.
3671663	3676885	So it would be just like, you know, if I sent a friend request to somebody, they don't have to agree to do it.
3678045	3681727	So why just leave it as yes, no, instead of numbers?
3681847	3683407	I don't know why you have to complicate things.
3683627	3691990	Mori in our chat room live on this Sunday evening at chat.org.com says, It's a really flawed system, especially considering Nintendo's justification.
3693786	3697370	QWhat5565 says, Nintendo can't be that stupid.
3697651	3699673	They have to be coming out with an easier add-on.
3699933	3701055	Maybe a report button.
3702476	3702717	Hmm.
3703898	3705660	Well, I mean, here, let me put it this way.
3706341	3709385	We still got time until the first, you know...
3709864	3710645	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3731741	3732842	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3752347	3753387	Just put yes or no.
3753508	3755809	I mean, is that so hard instead of having to enter in?
3756109	3760130	People put their damn friend codes on websites anyways, and they exchange them that way.
3760250	3763472	So how is that any different than yes or no?
3764152	3772416	You know what we should do is create a website, childmolesterfriendcodes.com, and encourage people to use the friend code systems to meet child molesters.
3773676	3775077	Obviously, I'm joking, people.
3775177	3777758	But, you know, I mean, Loki brings up a good point.
3778960	3784222	You can trade codes online with complete strangers who might turn out to be people you don't expect them to be.
3784482	3784982	I don't get it.
3785783	3790905	I don't get it either because if someone ends up being creepy or something, you delete their friend code.
3791605	3794566	Or, for example, with Xbox Live, you just defriend them.
3795706	3797367	Or push the button that reports them.
3797407	3798287	It's not that hard.
3798367	3799828	Although I know a lot of people don't use it.
3800328	3801528	I mean, how hard is it?
3801548	3805470	Oh no, people are going to send you stupid messages.
3805750	3807671	Oh, it's so hard to just delete them.
3807751	3808011	I mean...
3810131	3811492	GS68 says, how to meet child molesters?
3836499	3837419	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3856963	3865605	Oh no, wait, no, I can't do that, because I have to email all my damn friends now with the Wii system and say, hey, what's your friend code for Pokemon Battle Revolution?
3865905	3867986	Because I can't play you until, you know, I get this.
3868286	3872847	So it may take me a couple days before I'm actually able to play the game online with friends.
3874507	3879088	Hooray, mission accomplished, you've really, you know, embraced online.
3880268	3882709	Well, I think there's only one thing left to say about all of this.
3895021	3898563	For the second week in a row inspired by Nintendo Friend Codes.
3898643	3900764	No DarkSakura tonight, so Loki, you get first dibs.
3902666	3904327	My FU goes to drama.
3904587	3906888	I hate drama, and I hate drama that's unnecessary.
3906908	3908850	I'm leaving it at that for now.
3911131	3912552	My FU goes to bullies.
3913032	3920477	They come in all shapes and sizes, and Fortune 500 sizes, and bullies are not cool.
3921198	3923199	and Double Standards suck as well.
3923339	3924539	I really hate Double Standards.
3924899	3933723	I really, really, really, really hate when you see one thing applied this way here and then it's applied totally or a blind eye is turned over here.
3933883	3934963	I think that's stupid.
3935664	3936004	That's all.
3936324	3941886	Rice Princess, do you have anything you want to share?
3942906	3945427	Yes, so FU to Immaturity.
3945447	3947868	Yes, that's pretty much it.
3948048	3949349	I'm not going to get into specifics.
3951102	3953083	Some very vague FUs this week.
3953103	3956163	FU to the last Mimsy because it just got ridiculous towards the end.
3956583	3961425	Really ridiculous.
3961485	3966266	Some chatroom folks are entering honorary FUs on behalf of DarkSakura for not being here.
3966286	3968927	Joshi16 says, DarkSakura, FU to fucking drivers.
3968967	3969527	Drivers suck.
3969587	3969967	I hate them.
3970007	3970927	They should die in a fire.
3970967	3971767	Kingdom Hearts rules.
3971867	3972568	No FU to them.
3974983	3975644	That's great.
3975764	3977965	Oh, Drunami says F you to e-sluts on Myspace.
3978246	3979046	Yes, amen.
3979086	3981829	You know, I've been gone for four days, so I logged into Myspace.
3981969	3983490	I swear to God, 15 e-sluts.
3983750	3987013	That is going to kill Myspace, just like Slowness killed Friendster.
3987473	3987974	It really is.
3988614	3993538	It would not be that hard for Myspace to institute some way to get around that.
3993758	3995340	I think they kind of are right now.
3995440	4002986	Well, they have that whole thing where you can know my last name and get around it that way, so I'm thinking about putting this big thing on my profile that says my last name is Roberts.
4003817	4011500	You know, because I've used my fake last name that I use on the radio on the MySpace profile so that people in my real life I don't want to find me can't find me because they don't know my stage name.
4012081	4016043	So I'm thinking about just putting that really big so that the cam girls are fooled and they can't add me.
4016063	4022085	At least turn it on for a little while and hopefully it will get them to stop hitting my profile.
4022145	4022565	I don't know.
4023466	4025547	Just do what I do, Robin.
4025567	4027968	Just not check MySpace after, you know...
4028769	4029169	and DarkSakura.com.
4050233	4053996	That's, you know, there's that All Games community site, which is pretty rad as well.
4054036	4057058	Rice Princess, you should sign up for that because they talk games on there a lot.
4057078	4058359	I thought I did, but I guess I didn't.
4058379	4058559	Did you?
4058939	4059239	I don't know.
4059279	4060420	Well, maybe you did it while I've been gone.
4060460	4062161	I haven't checked the site in a few days.
4062201	4063722	There could have been some great blog posts.
4063762	4064223	I don't even know.
4064703	4068205	I have some game review haikus I have to catch up on for the community site.
4068225	4070607	So that's community.allgames.com.
4070627	4074670	Our buddies over there at All Games have set up their answer to Myspace.
4075149	4077791	minus the camhors plus all the gaming chat.
4078131	4078471	Really?
4078611	4079292	Yes, it's good times.
4079752	4080773	Then I might have to go there.
4080793	4083334	You'll probably get a lot of friend ads because OMG a chick.
4084355	4085015	Oh, okay.
4085095	4085696	No, not really.
4085776	4087517	I'm going to go in as a dude.
4087557	4088957	You get a lot of cool people over there.
4088998	4089638	It's a good community.
4089758	4097943	Because all listeners of this show and All Games and all the other shows that are on AllGames.com about the six or seven other indie podcasts they have that are on that network.
4097983	4098383	So it's cool.
4098823	4099244	Good times.
4099404	4100024	I'll check it out.
4100244	4100845	Good times.
4100905	4101165	Sweet.
4102848	4107310	Okay, TigerClaw wants to know if I checked the games and porn community site as well.
4107350	4111332	Apparently, All Games has these two spin-off community sites.
4111552	4116734	One of them is Rhythm Nation, which is for music-based games, and the other one is games and porn.
4117614	4121036	I have not looked at games and porn yet, but Rice Princess, that sounds right up your alley.
4121476	4122096	It totally is.
4122396	4123136	You might have to check that out.
4123196	4124097	Or just the porn.
4124657	4125337	That works too.
4126318	4128038	So no more news this segment, Loki?
4128879	4131660	That's it for Part A. Saving the good stuff for Part B?
4132373	4133014	A little bit, yeah.
4133114	4133394	All right.
4133635	4136117	Well, then we're going to take a little break here on Orange Launch Radio.
4136157	4150132	We'll be back in a little bit with more, including our Part B. And if you listen to us on the podcast feed, keep in mind you have to wait just a couple days for Part B. That way you get your OLR spaced out throughout the week, so that way you get a little bit to get you through the workday or the commute or the jog.
4150172	4154457	However you listen to us, you get a little bit on Mondays and you get a little more on Wednesdays.
4154858	4159383	For those of you guys listening live though, you only have to wait a few minutes and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4159764	4164749	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
4165210	4169515	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
