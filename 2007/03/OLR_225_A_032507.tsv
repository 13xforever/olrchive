0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and the Lowkey Arcade
14000	25000	Tonight, March 25th, 2007, Black Xbox 360s turn out to be real, Devil May Cry 4 is no longer an exclusive, and an old 80's arcade classic comes to Blu-ray
25000	29000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	40000	We are that video game podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know
41000	43000	You know, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, and all that fun stuff
44000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky if you check our forums or whatever
48000	49000	That's S-K-I-E, Sky
50000	53000	Joining us, as always, say hello to Tech Master Loki
53000	54000	Hello
54000	55000	How you doing Tech Master Loki?
55000	56000	I'm doing okay
57000	60000	Alright, you might wonder where Dark Sakura is at tonight, unfortunately she's not joining us tonight
61000	64000	She's very sick, she sends her love to all of you guys, but she has a sinus infection
65000	67000	I spoke to her on the phone briefly before we started tonight
68000	72000	And she apparently slept for 14 hours yesterday, which is, you know, a pretty surefire sinus
73000	75000	Someone's pretty sick, so, sorry Dark Sakura, rest up, feel better
76000	80000	And I was all excited too because I saw a Doctor Who pinball machine this weekend, which I'll get into in a little bit
80000	84000	No, but seriously, I was like, oh my gosh, this is like, this is Jamie times two
85000	87000	These are like two of her loves rolled up into one
88000	91000	Sort of like what I thought of, like Loki, I've had this thought about you before
92000	95000	The first time I ever went to that restaurant in the Bay Area that serves the slabs of meat
96000	97000	And they served the chicken wrapped in bacon
98000	99000	That made me think of you, because I was like, it's two of Loki's love
100000	102000	I might add, the chicken wrapped in bacon wasn't that great when I had it, so
103000	104000	Sorry to hear that
105000	107000	Alright, well we do have a female perspective on tonight's program
107000	110000	You know, not that we really need one, but we have one anyway
111000	112000	Just teasing, to all the ladies out there listening
113000	114000	Say hello to Rice Princess
115000	116000	Hello everyone
117000	118000	How are you doing Miss Rice Princess?
119000	120000	I'm doing well, how about you Rob?
121000	122000	Oh, pretty good, it's been an interesting week
123000	124000	Yeah, I agree
125000	126000	I agree
127000	128000	So you were talking about movies before we came in tonight, what did you see this week?
129000	130000	I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
131000	133000	Now how was it, because I read a review in some magazine that said it was absolute crap
133000	136000	Well that magazine's absolute crap, because it was so fucking awesome
137000	139000	Like it was fucking epic, it was great
140000	142000	Was it better than the old school ones from like the 90s with the ninja wrap?
143000	144000	There are two different things, that's apples and oranges
145000	147000	I just, I loved it, and I loved the old movies too
148000	149000	Chime in Matt
150000	153000	I did see it yesterday as well, and I, because I was a little scared
154000	156000	Because when I first saw the first trailer that came out, it looked badass
157000	158000	It was like, oh yeah
159000	160000	Then I saw these new trailers that they're showing on TV and stuff
160000	162000	And they kind of made it look stupid
163000	165000	But I swear, go see it, it's fucking awesome
166000	170000	And the reason why, they did make, it does tie in with the other three movies
171000	173000	And they do make some changes to the storyline
174000	177000	You know, it basically takes place after everything
178000	180000	And so, you know, April O'Neil's not a reporter anymore
181000	183000	And Casey Jones isn't exactly like he was in the other movies
184000	186000	But that's fine, you kind of forgive that when you see it
186000	189000	It's just, it never lets you down
190000	193000	It was one of those movies that I was watching it, and I was just like, fuck, this is awesome
194000	199000	You know, it wasn't, really I haven't had that much of a satisfying movie experience in a while
200000	202000	And this was one of those movies that just, it was awesome
203000	208000	It brought me back to what made Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles so cool in the first place
209000	211000	It just, it was very satisfying
212000	214000	And I really suggest, just ignore the negative reviews out there for it
214000	217000	Because it really is good, and I cannot wait for the sequel
218000	220000	Are you on somebody's payola, like New Line's payola?
221000	222000	I'm not, I'm not on anybody's payroll for this kind of stuff
223000	227000	It was awesome, and yeah, I would love to see it again
228000	231000	It really, there's a lot of parts that even have, you know
232000	234000	I was telling Irene about one scene towards the end of the movie or something
235000	236000	Which has to do with my Cage Man song, by the way
237000	241000	That, it's just, when that scene kicked in, it was like, fuck yeah, that's awesome
241000	245000	So, highly, highly recommend this movie, especially if you're a fan of
246000	250000	You know, the original Ninja Turtles movie, maybe not so much number two and definitely not three
251000	254000	But, you know, even the old series and stuff, it really works
255000	259000	And it sounds like that this is going to be something that kind of jump starts the whole movie series all over again
260000	262000	I'm looking in our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show
263000	266000	Because, you know, part of what makes this show so unique, shall we say
267000	269000	Is that we always encourage the live interaction with our chat room
269000	273000	And the phone calls, which we'll take later, chat.orangelaundry.com if you want to join in
274000	275000	If you're listening live on this Sunday night
276000	280000	Let's see, we have Blaze from the O.L. Army says TMNT was fucking amazing
281000	284000	Joshi16 says one of the turtles is gay, is there a gay turtle now?
285000	287000	There's not a gay turtle in there, not at all
288000	291000	Let's see, Wonder Dog Harold says are they really still teenagers at this point?
291000	298000	Okay, well maybe not, yeah, because they're pretty old by now, but I was kind of thinking, well maybe teenage for, like, turtles
299000	301000	I don't know how long turtles live, but, you know
302000	303000	Yeah, I've never done that
304000	305000	Maybe it's like dog ears or something like that, you know, I don't know
306000	313000	Well, I mean, not to, I don't think this is spoiling anything, but they've all, like, kind of, I guess, taken on, like, responsibilities
314000	317000	Or have, like, moved on past, like, how they used to live before
317000	320000	So I guess it's kind of showing that they've, like, grown up a little bit, but
321000	323000	I don't know, they still, I guess their mentality is still kind of, like, a teenage mentality
324000	327000	There was a lot of adult humor in it, which is great, like, a lot of funny stuff
328000	333000	It was just awesome, I mean, I mean, if anyone that's going to see it obviously doesn't have to do a shredder anymore
334000	338000	This is kind of after all that, they've defeated them, the Foot Clan's kind of been disbanded a little bit
339000	343000	Where at least they've gone underground, and then it's kind of what they've done since then
343000	348000	They kind of went on with their lives, because now they don't have to really protect, you know, New York from anything
349000	354000	They're just kind of living, and so now they have to kind of come together
355000	357000	And, you know, it's just, it was really awesome
358000	361000	Even the opening scene where they're showing kind of that flashback with the battle and stuff
362000	363000	That was awesome
364000	365000	That was great, oh my gosh
366000	367000	Right now I was like, oh my god, this movie's going to be cool
368000	371000	Because it was just, it never let you down at all
371000	373000	There was a little bit of humor, you know, from the show
374000	377000	Because, I mean, they were kind of, you know, Michelangelo, of course, is still goofy and stuff
378000	382000	But it wasn't, like, detracting, and it was, it fit, it fit with the characters
383000	386000	And I'm just really glad they kind of respected the actual characters
387000	390000	And didn't make it so retarded and all one-liners
391000	392000	I mean, there were one-liners in there, but it worked
393000	398000	Yeah, it did, like, a lot of them were puns, but I absolutely love puns
398000	400000	I think puns are, like, the greatest jokes ever
401000	404000	And, like, it really worked, I mean, if you were a fan of the old cartoon series
405000	407000	Or if you watched the movies, I mean, you saw that anyway in the movies or the series
408000	411000	So it's, like, it was just more of that, you know, and it was appropriate to the times, too
412000	415000	The only thing that really kind of annoyed me was Splinter's voice
416000	420000	I know, I know, like, I'm all, did, like, some Chinese dude, like, do his voice or something?
421000	422000	No, he sounded Jewish
423000	424000	Really? You think so? I'm like, wow, Splinter
425000	426000	Oh my god, Turtles
426000	428000	I know, seriously, it was kind of weird, but
429000	430000	Well, alright, we can talk movies all night
431000	432000	Did any of you guys play the games yet? The Ninja Turtles games?
433000	433000	No, no
434000	435000	I played the old one on Ninja Turtles
436000	437000	That, unlike the movie, did kind of suck
438000	439000	Alright, well, let's get into a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week
440000	442000	Where we talk about the video games that we've been playing this week here on the program
443000	444000	Rice Princess, what have you been playing?
445000	450000	Um, I have actually not played anything this week
451000	454000	I, like I said before, I cancelled my WoW account for the time being
454000	455000	Ouch
456000	460000	So I kind of have been not doing, I've been, like, doing stuff around the house
461000	463000	Did you watch anyone play something that looked cool and that you wanted to have?
464000	466000	Oh, no, you know what I played? I played DDR
467000	468000	Did you? Alright, there you go
469000	471000	In the arcade, yes, for the first time in, like, two years, it was awesome
472000	473000	What was it, Supernova, Extreme?
474000	478000	Um, I played, um, Supernova and I played a little bit of, um, whatever's that golfing?
479000	480000	The other one, Extreme, I think it was
481000	482000	Max 2, I think
482000	484000	I played that, yeah, it was good times
485000	486000	Memories?
487000	491000	Yeah, like, I was surprised because I could actually do, like, 7 and 8 footers again
492000	493000	Whereas I couldn't do that, like, two years ago
494000	495000	And I was like, sweet, I don't suck anymore
496000	497000	So, yeah, it was good times
498000	499000	Cool, Loki!
500000	502000	I finally, I've been waiting for this game for a while
503000	504000	And it's just a really weird game to wait for
505000	508000	But Earth Defense Force 2017, it is awesome
508000	512000	It is so stupid and so ridiculous and the voice acting is so horrible
513000	514000	But it's so fun to play
515000	516000	It's just, basically, at least
517000	518000	I know nothing about this game, what is this?
519000	521000	It is basically these aliens come and start attacking Earth
522000	524000	And it is so B-movie, cheesy and stuff
525000	525000	I mean, for example
526000	526000	Like, Destroy All Humans?
527000	530000	Not exactly, like, we're talking, like, robots and giant ants
531000	532000	I mean, that's giant ants
533000	536000	That's what you're fighting for the first few levels is giant ants
536000	538000	And it works
539000	542000	Well, in Final Fantasy, you fight giant slimes to level up
543000	544000	Okay, but still, though, I mean, it's giant ants
545000	547000	And the voice acting is so horrible
548000	550000	Like, for example, they're all, look, it's flying
551000	552000	Or, look at those alien spaceships
553000	554000	It's like something out of the science fiction movie
555000	557000	Not a science fiction movie, the science fiction movie
558000	559000	Like, the one and only that's ever been made
560000	560000	Exactly
561000	564000	And so, I don't know, it's just, I can't stop playing
564000	568000	Basically, you have, you can collect up to 200 weapons in this game
569000	571000	By replaying the levels over and over, you can level up your characters
572000	573000	Or whatever, get your stamina higher
574000	576000	And you can actually, you can play it through five different difficulty levels
577000	578000	I've been playing it through, like, normal and easy
579000	580000	And even normal is starting to get hard now
581000	583000	Playing it on hard, which is not even all the way up to, like,
584000	586000	They have, like, extreme inferno or something
587000	589000	Hard is fucking impossible
590000	592000	So, inferno's gotta be, oh my god
592000	593000	Oh my god
594000	596000	But, it's pretty fun though
597000	599000	It's two player co-op, which is kinda cool, split screen
600000	601000	So I'm really looking forward to playing that at work
602000	603000	But, it's just so cheesy though
604000	605000	It's really worth picking up
606000	607000	The achievements are not easy in it
608000	610000	It's basically beating the game on each difficulty
611000	612000	And unlocking every single weapon
613000	613000	That's your achievements
614000	615000	Six achievements for 1,000 points
616000	618000	But, it's, you know, it's one of those games though
619000	620000	You have infinite ammo
620000	622000	And you have some weird weapons that are in the game
623000	625000	In fact, there's one missile that I unlocked in the very beginning
626000	627000	It's a piece of shit
628000	629000	It's the slowest moving missile I've ever seen
630000	631000	I mean, the thing is going, like, less than five miles an hour
632000	633000	Just crawling across the air
634000	635000	And it doesn't hardly do any damage
636000	638000	But, it's fun because you can pick, you know, one of two weapons
639000	640000	To use each, throughout the whole game
641000	643000	So you just select your weapons, play your mission, and that's it
644000	646000	And the best part about it though, you can blow up everything
647000	648000	Buildings, doesn't matter, no one gives a crap
648000	649000	Because you're saving the earth
650000	652000	So, what do I do? I just start launching random missiles
653000	654000	Into every single skyscraper I see
655000	656000	And watching them all fall
657000	658000	And it's entertaining because they're there at the next level
659000	660000	Because there's no continuity whatsoever
661000	662000	So do you recommend the game?
663000	663000	I highly recommend the game
664000	666000	Let me tell you, the frame rate's crap
667000	668000	The graphics suck, the sound is awful
669000	670000	And the voice acting's horrible
671000	672000	And the AI is pretty retarded as well
673000	674000	So are you saying it's so bad it's good?
675000	675000	It is
675000	677000	It's the showgirls of video games?
678000	679000	It's so bad, it's so bad
680000	681000	But that's the thing, you gotta play it
682000	683000	Realizing that it's gonna suck in these areas
684000	685000	And to be honest, the graphics don't need to be that great
686000	687000	It's like an old arcade game
688000	691000	I mean, old arcade games, they're not that many polygons and stuff
692000	693000	But it works, it's just fun to play
694000	695000	So it may look like crap
696000	697000	It may be very fucking hard at times
698000	699000	The AI can be dumb
700000	701000	Because I saw some soldier or whatever
702000	703000	I was trying to find these people
703000	706000	So they would join me and help kill the alien ants
707000	709000	And this guy was shooting a shotgun into a building
710000	712000	Because he was stupid and couldn't figure out how to get around the building
713000	714000	That's awesome
715000	716000	I don't know, it's funny
717000	719000	But it's still a lot of fun to play
720000	722000	It does not stop getting fun
723000	724000	So really highly recommend this game
725000	727000	It's only like 40 bucks for the 360
728000	729000	Definitely worth picking up
730000	731000	Even if you can find it used, that's even better
731000	732000	So I recommend it
733000	734000	It's a lot of fun
735000	737000	Definitely a lot better than from what I've heard from Armored Core 4
738000	740000	And other than that, I played Crackdown a little bit
741000	742000	That's about it though
743000	745000	I've been just trying to get the last few achievements and stuff
746000	747000	Kind of getting a little bored with the game
748000	749000	Because now that you're at the end of the game and stuff
750000	751000	There's not much to do
752000	754000	Oh, and Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories
755000	756000	We've been playing that
757000	758000	At work we put custom firmwares in all of our PSPs now
758000	760000	So we're all playing it overclocked, which is fun
761000	762000	It actually looks a lot nicer
763000	764000	We have a guy that's working
765000	768000	Actually he's a pretty famous cheat designer for the Vice City Stories
769000	770000	Durga Durga Man
771000	773000	He's working on a multiplayer code to switch out some of the weapons
774000	775000	And get some different stuff
776000	777000	So hopefully that'll happen
778000	780000	And I am so looking forward to this week when the Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer hits on Friday
781000	782000	That is going to be awesome
783000	784000	I am going to watch that thing like 16 times on Friday
785000	786000	Analyze every frame
786000	787000	Oh yeah
788000	790000	Alright, we'll be looking forward to your thoughts on that trailer on Sunday then
791000	791000	Oh yeah
792000	793000	Alright
794000	796000	Miggletov, I noticed you snuck in here while we were starting the show
797000	798000	First off, hello, how are you doing?
799000	800000	Hello, I'm fine
801000	802000	Alright, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing?
803000	804000	Only been playing two things
805000	807000	World of Warcraft, I made my alternate character
808000	809000	His name is Agathon
810000	811000	And his pet is named Helo
812000	812000	Oh my gosh, that's awesome
813000	814000	Because I'm a big Battlestar nerd now
814000	815000	Because it's so good
816000	817000	It is so good
818000	819000	It's the best and Helo's hot
820000	823000	And then other than that, finally at work
824000	826000	Thanks to being at a developer place
827000	829000	I've been playing a lot of Boom Boom Rocket
830000	833000	And it's the best game I've ever played in my life called Boom Boom Rocket
834000	835000	And it's pretty and I love it
836000	837000	I'm not sure how to take that
838000	839000	It's the best game you've ever played in your life called that
839000	843000	I could say Big Mother Truckers was the best game I ever played in my life
844000	846000	That's a lie, because it wasn't a good game at all
847000	851000	But Boom Boom Rocket, if I didn't have a 360, would sell me on a 360
852000	853000	Because it's really just that much fun
854000	855000	What the hell is it? Because I still don't know that much about it
856000	857000	Are you allowed to tell us what it is?
858000	859000	I won't mention specifics, I don't know
860000	861000	It's not our game, I don't care
865000	867000	It's a music game with fireworks
867000	871000	So it's like Fantavision meets DDR with a touch of Beatmania
872000	874000	Because the fireworks make noise for Beatmania
875000	877000	And if you hit arrows when you're not supposed to
878000	880000	It penalizes you like Beatmania does as well
881000	882000	So you can't just mess around
883000	887000	But the track list is not stellar, but it gets the job done
888000	891000	And if you like Fantavision and you like pretty things
892000	894000	It's really, really fun and lots of explosions
894000	896000	High def, good stuff?
897000	898000	Yeah, oh my goodness
899000	901000	I don't know, I must have played that a lot this week
902000	904000	I got all the achievements, they're all really easy
905000	906000	Especially if you play music games
907000	909000	And it's just a whole lot of fun
910000	914000	I don't know, it almost convinced somebody at work to get a 360 too
915000	916000	Because he was really enjoying it
917000	919000	Interesting, so the music game fans will be all over this
919000	927000	Maybe, it depends on if you care about the quality of music you're playing the game to
928000	930000	Alpha Canogram says it sounds like every Xtend Xtra
931000	932000	No, because this game is good
933000	935000	I liked every Xtend Xtra, whatever
936000	937000	Every Xtend Xtra
938000	940000	Music was a part of it, kind of like Rez
941000	942000	But Rez wasn't really a music game
943000	944000	The music was an important element
945000	946000	That's what every Xtend Xtra is like
946000	953000	This is a rhythm game, it's not a game where you blow something up to cause chain reactions
954000	957000	Every time you hit one of those arrows, fireworks explosions happen
958000	961000	It's like DDR once you hit a hundred combo
962000	963000	You get a little flashy explosions
964000	966000	But there's timing issues with the game too
967000	968000	And I don't think they'll be fixed before
969000	971000	I'm pretty sure what I was playing is the release candidate
972000	974000	I just need it to come out now really bad
974000	975000	That's it
976000	977000	Alright, we'll see what happens
978000	980000	My gaming week, interestingly enough
981000	982000	I don't know if you were listening last week
983000	984000	But I mentioned I was going to be going on vacation for a little while
985000	987000	So I have been on vacation the past four days in the middle of nowhere
988000	990000	I was up in the Mendocino, Fort Bragg, coastal area, Northern California
991000	995000	No internet, no phones, no games, really nothing
996000	998000	So it's just nice to have a break away from everything
999000	1002000	I'll get into what effect that's going to have on tonight's show in just a minute
1002000	1004000	But yeah, I just took a break
1005000	1009000	But before I left, I did get to sneak in a little bit of Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live
1010000	1012000	Oh my heck, it is awesome
1013000	1014000	It's so great
1015000	1021000	Just the fact that they brought back one of the greatest video games of all time
1022000	1023000	And they didn't change much
1024000	1026000	They do have that enhanced mode
1026000	1032000	Which basically means somewhat smoother, cleaner sprites and changed sound effects
1033000	1034000	But really they didn't change that much
1035000	1037000	Don't let that talk of a new high def mode thing fool you
1038000	1039000	It still looks like the old PlayStation 1 game
1040000	1041000	But that's not a bad thing
1042000	1042000	No, obviously
1043000	1044000	Especially for Xbox Live Arcade
1045000	1046000	Yeah, if it ain't broke, don't fix it
1047000	1049000	Exactly, and really they didn't change anything
1050000	1052000	It's an awesome deal for $10
1052000	1055000	I mean, great, if you still have your old PlayStation hooked up
1056000	1060000	And you've got your disc available to play the PlayStation games or whatever
1061000	1063000	Then have fun, go play the old version as you remember it
1064000	1067000	But for the rest of us, our PlayStations were thrown in the closet a long time ago
1068000	1070000	We lost our copies of Castlevania Symphony of the Night
1071000	1072000	This is awesome
1073000	1074000	Didn't you mention something about no loading times or anything?
1075000	1076000	Oh yeah, there's no loading times
1077000	1077000	You don't have to wait for anything
1078000	1079000	They kept all the voice acting intact
1079000	1082000	It's great, I mean, I definitely recommend
1083000	1084000	Especially if you've never played it before
1085000	1086000	Oh my gosh
1087000	1088000	It's got a lot of hours that you can put into the game if you've never played it before
1089000	1092000	There's no excuse to have never played that game before
1093000	1094000	Like, I don't care
1095000	1098000	I'm looking in chatroom, Blay says Sky was a hippie for four days basically
1099000	1099000	Yeah, basically
1100000	1100000	When it comes down to it, I was
1101000	1102000	Yeah, so back to Symphony of the Night
1103000	1105000	Well, I'll be playing plenty more Symphony of the Night now that I'm back from vacation
1105000	1109000	And another game I picked up today was Tetris Evolution on 360
1110000	1112000	But I've literally played it for 15 minutes, so I don't have enough to say on it
1113000	1116000	My initial impressions are, why didn't they just put this on Live Arcade?
1117000	1118000	But then again, it was only $30, so it was a cheaper title
1119000	1123000	And the idea of being able to play Tetris on Xbox Live is pretty cool
1124000	1126000	But I'll give you my full thoughts on that next week
1127000	1130000	Because it doesn't seem bad, but it doesn't seem as great as Tetris DS either
1131000	1132000	And those are just my initial five minute thoughts
1132000	1134000	But I'll look at it more in depth later
1135000	1136000	It looked okay, they had videos playing in the background
1137000	1138000	The HD videos looked pretty hot, so I'll give you that
1139000	1141000	But what was kind of interesting though is they also had
1142000	1144000	You can cheat in it just like you can with the Tetris DS
1145000	1148000	You can rotate blocks or whatever and then you can actually
1149000	1153000	Basically kind of hover them there forever until you decide where you want to put them
1154000	1155000	That's pretty sweet
1156000	1158000	Alright, so I'll give you more thoughts on that next week here on the program
1158000	1161000	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight
1162000	1165000	While I was out for four days, apparently some stuff has gone down on Live 365
1166000	1171000	And it has to do with this new CRB, the Copyright Royalty Board
1172000	1176000	If you want to know more information on it, go to www.live365.com slash choice
1177000	1180000	And of course, Live 365 is where we broadcast our live feed
1181000	1184000	Obviously the live element is an important part of our show
1184000	1187000	We don't want it to go anywhere, so we suggest you guys all check this out
1188000	1192000	I know our buddy Travis Donovan went into detail on this on his program on Saturday night
1193000	1197000	I haven't had a chance to listen to it yet, so if you want to go check him out on iTunes under Travis Donovan
1198000	1199000	You can check out what he has to say on it
1200000	1201000	We don't know what we're going to do about this yet
1202000	1204000	We understand it has changed some rules already on Live 365
1205000	1208000	Which may be kind of a pain in the butt to listen to us on Live 365
1208000	1214000	Long story short, we don't play enough ASCAP, BMI type music on this program
1215000	1218000	To justify if they're going to raise the rates much more of keeping Live 365
1219000	1220000	We don't know yet what we're going to do
1221000	1223000	We do have other offers on the table we're going to be looking at
1224000	1226000	And if we have to go underground, we may just do that as well
1227000	1229000	But obviously the live element is an important factor of our show
1230000	1231000	And we don't want to lose that anytime soon
1232000	1233000	This shouldn't affect the podcast feed
1233000	1237000	Worst case scenario, if the rates of Live 365 had to go through the roof
1238000	1240000	We might have to go a couple of weeks with no live element
1241000	1243000	But we would find a new home, set up something on Shoutcast, I don't know
1244000	1246000	But seeing as we're Orange Mountains Radio is a bit of a network now
1247000	1248000	Because we have some other great shows like STFU on Thursdays
1249000	1250000	And Travis Donovan on Saturdays
1251000	1253000	We don't want to lose any of those other shows that we've built up over time
1254000	1259000	More to come on that when we have some time to sit down and take this all in
1260000	1261000	What's going on with us
1261000	1264000	Because again, I'm just getting back and kind of hitting all this news
1265000	1270000	And I want to check out what the rest of the OLR staff has to say about it
1271000	1272000	So we'll see
1273000	1274000	Travis Donovan is in chat and says
1275000	1277000	Urges folks to visit Live 365.com slash choice
1278000	1280000	And says you all need to contact your local congress person
1281000	1282000	And let them know they need to level the playing field again
1283000	1285000	Over the air radio does not pay royalty rates
1286000	1287000	But internet and satellite radio must
1288000	1289000	Doesn't sound very fair to me
1289000	1292000	And it's going to hurt the little guys like us and other great Live 365
1293000	1295000	And just internet radio stations in general
1296000	1297000	So that kind of sucks
1298000	1300000	So we'll have more info on that next week
1301000	1302000	We'll see
1303000	1304000	Also, as far as housekeeping goes
1305000	1306000	Tonight we're going to change things up a little bit
1307000	1308000	Dark Sakura's not here
1309000	1310000	And I, of course, have been out of town for the last four days
1311000	1312000	So I'm a little bit out of the loop on gaming news
1313000	1314000	So Loki's going to be news boy tonight
1315000	1317000	And all of our news tonight will be presented by Loki
1317000	1319000	So we are going to break our usual format a little bit
1320000	1322000	So take it away Loki, what happened this week?
1323000	1324000	Hooray, well the big thing that happened, of course
1325000	1327000	At least if you're in the UK and most of the other world
1328000	1330000	The PlayStation 3 finally came out for you
1331000	1332000	That time has finally come
1333000	1335000	You can finally buy your overpriced gaming machine
1336000	1339000	And there were some interesting stories coming out about that
1340000	1342000	Of course, one that pretty much sums everything up
1343000	1344000	Phil Harrison
1344000	1349000	Basically was saying that Europe is the most important continent
1350000	1351000	For the gaming industry
1352000	1355000	Which is funny because it was also the last one to get the PlayStation 3
1356000	1358000	But apparently the third is also the most important
1359000	1361000	And he was told
1362000	1364000	You know, this gameindustry.biz
1365000	1366000	Big industry site
1367000	1369000	It's got the most countries and it's got the most people
1370000	1371000	It's also got the most cultures
1371000	1373000	The fact that we've got the launch here
1374000	1376000	With more consoles shipped on day one
1377000	1378000	Than we've ever had in our history
1379000	1381000	Is a compliment to the most important market
1382000	1384000	Of the world, the European market
1385000	1387000	I don't know, that sounds a lot of sucking up to me
1388000	1389000	Especially since
1390000	1391000	What?
1392000	1394000	They've had so many delays, they've had to pay more
1395000	1397000	They didn't get the 20 YIG model at launch
1397000	1400000	Oh, and which we'll get into a little bit later
1401000	1403000	Their backwards compatibility has kind of been
1404000	1405000	Hurt a little bit
1406000	1407000	So
1408000	1409000	I don't know, I think it's kind of stupid
1410000	1411000	This strikes me as nothing more than fluffy PR
1412000	1413000	Nothing less, nothing more
1414000	1416000	This is just nice little sound bite statements
1417000	1419000	Made by official Sony people to get all over the Europe press
1420000	1421000	About how freaking important they are blah blah blah
1422000	1423000	And believe me, listeners abroad
1424000	1425000	I'm not trying to belittle the situation
1425000	1426000	But obviously
1427000	1428000	If Sony cared that much
1429000	1431000	They would have done things a little differently, correct?
1432000	1433000	But oh wait, it doesn't stop there
1434000	1435000	To prove that point
1436000	1439000	They even went out of their way to give out free TVs
1440000	1442000	To the first 100 people purchasing the Playstation 3
1443000	1444000	At their London launch event
1445000	1447000	Free 46 inch HDTVs
1448000	1449000	And a free taxi ride home with those
1450000	1451000	Jesus, that's not a bad deal
1452000	1453000	Where's my damn TV?
1453000	1454000	I want to know
1455000	1457000	Wait, the 100 people that sat out online
1458000	1459000	Like this incentive to wait in the cold or whatever?
1460000	1461000	Yeah
1462000	1464000	So in the US, you have to wait two days
1465000	1466000	And dodge bullets
1467000	1468000	Maybe have to race and slam into a pole
1469000	1470000	And get sent to the hospital in a coma
1471000	1473000	Exactly, and then in the UK you get free TVs
1474000	1475000	To go with your gaming systems and stuff
1477000	1478000	Yeah, Raven's Dolphin in chat says
1479000	1480000	We get shot, they get TVs, what the fuck?
1480000	1482000	That's a big PR
1483000	1484000	Is that just because British people are nicer, or what is that?
1485000	1486000	Maybe
1487000	1489000	Is that to encourage people to actually go outside and wait in line or what?
1490000	1491000	Well, they didn't know that this was going to happen
1492000	1494000	This was just something that they did
1495000	1497000	I mean, if they said, hey, by the way, we're going to give away free 46 inch TVs
1498000	1499000	Everyone would have been there
1500000	1502000	It would have been like the opening of an Ikea
1503000	1504000	When Ikea's open, everybody knows
1505000	1506000	The first people in line get huge certificates
1507000	1508000	And suddenly the lines are around the block
1508000	1509000	Yeah
1510000	1511000	Well, that's interesting, though
1512000	1513000	That they didn't announce that
1514000	1515000	Because why wouldn't they announce it
1516000	1519000	And get the long lines for the media to photograph
1520000	1522000	So they can go, hey, look how popular the PS3 is in Europe
1523000	1524000	Even though they had to wait six months for it
1525000	1526000	But here's the thing, though
1527000	1528000	If they did something like that, they'd be like, yeah, but it's only because you're giving away free TVs
1529000	1530000	I mean, it's not because of the PlayStation 3
1531000	1532000	And they would have just spun it that way
1533000	1535000	I think this is just kissing ass
1535000	1537000	It's a whole lot of kissing ass
1538000	1539000	It's like, please don't be mad at us that we waited so long
1540000	1542000	And you have to pay more for a system that actually does less
1543000	1544000	Please don't be mad
1545000	1546000	Joshi16 says, Sony was eating crayons
1547000	1548000	They weren't eating crayons
1549000	1550000	They were just kissing ass
1551000	1552000	That's all it was
1553000	1556000	Now, GS68 says, doesn't free stuff, bundles with something up the price
1557000	1558000	But you're saying these are absolutely free TVs
1559000	1560000	That they gave away to the first
1561000	1562000	Absolutely free
1562000	1564000	Is it the UK Retailer London store?
1565000	1566000	I think so
1567000	1568000	It was where they were doing their launch event
1569000	1570000	Where the Sony president would be heading out the first PS3 type thing
1571000	1572000	Something like that
1573000	1574000	I don't know
1575000	1576000	Anyways, along the lines of that
1577000	1578000	The UK Retailer game
1579000	1586000	They were quoted as saying that they were very happy with the amount of supply and demand that they had for the console
1586000	1592000	And it was actually the first time that they were actually able to fulfill all the demand in short term
1593000	1595000	So that's something that's never happened before
1596000	1600000	Sony withheld the release of the PS3 in order to build up stock levels for the launch
1601000	1603000	The situation with the Xbox 360 was terrible
1604000	1607000	And the Wii doesn't even hit the sides when it comes in
1607000	1616000	I think it's a very good move on Sony's part, it won't have that negativity of not being able to supply enough units
1617000	1619000	So that's good that they're able to supply enough units
1620000	1622000	I don't know if that's really an issue though
1623000	1625000	I think the demand is just less for it
1628000	1630000	Cool that they have enough units out there
1631000	1632000	Unfortunately though
1633000	1635000	And it kind of gets into that whole demand thing
1635000	1638000	Because outside of the launch event
1639000	1641000	It wasn't so pretty for Sony
1642000	1647000	In fact, there was a few situations where you only had a few people lining up for the system and no one cared
1648000	1650000	For example, Virgin Megastore
1651000	1653000	They had some campers outside
1654000	1659000	But it was really only about three or so people that were waiting in line for the system
1659000	1665000	And a lot of other stores, there were some situations where they were breaking street in Italy and stuff like that
1666000	1670000	And there's also stuff where people were just not coming in pre-ordering or even buying the system at all
1671000	1673000	So a lot of people said, who cares at this point
1674000	1676000	I don't know, so it's kind of negative a little bit
1677000	1682000	What do you think made the UK folks not want to line up for it?
1683000	1684000	Do you think it was because of what happened over here?
1684000	1688000	Do you think maybe they just don't get excited like this?
1689000	1692000	Although I seem to think that I remember the UK folks were lining up for the Wii and everything
1693000	1695000	They don't want to line up for it because it costs too much and it's a stupid system
1696000	1697000	There you go
1698000	1699000	Why? Why is it a stupid system?
1700000	1701000	Because it has no games on it
1702000	1705000	It has everything you can get on the 360 except resistance
1706000	1707000	But Gundam!
1708000	1709000	Jokes
1709000	1715000	And the only thing cool about the PS3 is that stupid home thing that's coming out this summer or fall or whatever and I want that
1716000	1717000	But other than that, it's stupid
1718000	1720000	Yeah, I think it's a little bit what Shane said, maybe not so harsh
1721000	1723000	It's not a lot of games out there right now
1724000	1726000	Not a lot of exclusive stuff that's really must have
1727000	1732000	It's really one of those systems that maybe it's better off to wait when the price comes down a little bit and there's more of a library
1733000	1734000	Also, they were kind of getting shafted for a while
1735000	1737000	A lot of people that were waiting the six months or whatever
1737000	1738000	Not six months
1739000	1740000	Four months
1741000	1742000	Three months to get the system
1743000	1744000	Probably say, hey, you know what?
1745000	1746000	Maybe 360 is a little bit better
1747000	1748000	Maybe I should just pick this up now
1749000	1750000	Because I can get it now and there's a big library of games out there
1751000	1752000	Or get the Wii
1753000	1754000	Making them wait for a while
1755000	1758000	If they're really itching to get their grasp of the new game systems
1759000	1761000	They're just going to go someplace else and get something that's out now
1762000	1763000	I don't know
1763000	1768000	They're really having a hard time distinguishing themselves as why you need this system
1769000	1770000	So that's one thing
1771000	1776000	The UK didn't have the only problems with launches
1777000	1779000	Australia, the launch wasn't very great over there
1780000	1784000	In fact, their launch event only drew about 40 people
1785000	1787000	I had read that a lot of these launch events were getting cancelled
1787000	1792000	Because of the fear of gunshots and all the crap that happened here
1793000	1794000	I didn't hear too many of that
1795000	1798000	But I know the ones that they were talking about in Australia
1799000	1801000	They had about maybe 40 people show up
1802000	1804000	Another 30 that were press
1805000	1807000	And it was pretty much like kind of
1808000	1810000	I don't know, just people weren't really excited about it
1811000	1815000	I don't know if it's just because not a lot of people were pre-ordering them
1815000	1816000	Or just no one really wanted them
1817000	1819000	Rice Princess, you'd want to comment earlier but got cut off
1820000	1823000	I know, I was just going to say they're all busy playing Wii bowling
1824000	1826000	They're too busy to go stand out in line and wait for Sony?
1827000	1828000	Yeah, because they're playing a good system
1829000	1830000	Because they're playing Wii bowling, okay
1831000	1832000	Would you have camped out for this?
1833000	1834000	No
1835000	1836000	Let's say you had the money
1837000	1839000	Let's say you had 600 euros, dollars, whatever right now
1840000	1841000	Would you go camp out?
1842000	1843000	No, because I probably already have a Wii
1843000	1844000	And I don't have a desire to have a PS3
1845000	1846000	I'd be spending my time on the Wii
1847000	1848000	I've got a question for you
1849000	1850000	You've been very vocal about your hate for Xbox on this show previously
1851000	1853000	Would you buy an Xbox at this point before Playstation 3?
1854000	1855000	If I had?
1856000	1857000	In terms of if I had to
1858000	1860000	Because obviously I wouldn't buy it on my own
1861000	1862000	But if I had to
1865000	1866000	Probably
1867000	1868000	I probably would
1869000	1870000	Huh, that's a very interesting thing
1870000	1872000	Miklotov wants to comment, he's dying over there
1873000	1874000	Why would they be playing Wii bowling?
1875000	1876000	Because the Wii sucks
1877000	1878000	I don't like it
1879000	1881000	Wait a minute, wait so you hate the Wii and the Playstation 3?
1882000	1883000	Yes, I like the 360
1884000	1886000	I seem to recall though on this program you were very excited about the Wii
1887000	1888000	I was
1889000	1890000	When did this change in heart happen?
1891000	1893000	Well it was when Nintendo decided that they were too good to release games anymore
1894000	1895000	And I don't want to play crappy games
1896000	1897000	And that's all they've been giving us lately
1897000	1899000	You do this all the time though, to be fair
1900000	1904000	I distinctly remember you sold your Xbox 360 back for the same reason
1905000	1906000	How many PS2's have I had?
1907000	1909000	When Final Fantasy 11 came out you bought a new one eventually
1910000	1912000	Because you were like, ooh I have to be a corsair because they're pretty
1913000	1915000	I mean, have you sold your Wii back at this point?
1916000	1918000	No, but my Wii has been broken since I got it
1919000	1920000	And I have my little return sticker for Nintendo
1921000	1922000	I need to call and get a new one actually
1923000	1925000	But I have no desire to send it back because
1925000	1927000	What am I going to play on it right now?
1928000	1929000	Sell it, I mean seriously you can sell it
1930000	1932000	They're going for a lot of money right now because they can't find them
1933000	1934000	And people want them
1935000	1936000	So if you don't want yours, might as well sell it
1937000	1938000	But at the end of the year you're going to get your Mario Galaxy
1939000	1940000	Your Metroid, you're going to want one anyway
1941000	1942000	I have no desire for Mario Galaxy thanks to Sunshine
1943000	1944000	But Metroid, yeah, Smash Brothers, yeah
1945000	1946000	Maybe they'll have another color by then
1947000	1948000	I'm a color whore anyway
1949000	1951000	I want something you'll talk about later
1952000	1953000	Let's see
1953000	1954000	Let's see
1955000	1956000	Let's see
1957000	1960000	Joshi16 says the exact same thing happened on the DS, don't act surprised
1961000	1962000	What, the
1963000	1964000	Oh, I was thinking the color changes, like yeah
1965000	1966000	But oh, the lack of games
1967000	1968000	Lack of games
1969000	1970000	Yeah, but you know what, I could play some good games on like
1971000	1972000	From Game Boy Advance
1973000	1974000	I could play GameCube games on this and not be fulfilled
1975000	1976000	Because GameCube games aren't that good either
1977000	1979000	Blaze says die, Miklotov die
1980000	1981000	You can die too
1981000	1983000	Tetsuya says Miklotov's Wii's been broken
1984000	1985000	Which SakuraMax follows right up with
1986000	1987000	Don't worry, Mama will fix it
1988000	1990000	That's creepy and so quit talking please
1991000	1992000	For the record
1993000	1996000	If you listen to last week's program I was all excited about playing Cookie Mama this week
1997000	1999000	I went to Toys R Us today to try to get it when I bought Tetris
2000000	2002000	Because I had something to take back so I had a credit there anyway
2003000	2004000	And they told me it didn't come out until next week
2005000	2006000	It came out last week
2007000	2008000	They're retarded
2008000	2010000	They're just lying to me, to my face
2011000	2012000	Yeah, they have old information or their shipments didn't come in
2013000	2014000	Bitch!
2015000	2017000	It's not, it was not something that was delayed
2018000	2019000	It's been out there
2020000	2021000	I've heard the games being crap reviews anyway
2022000	2023000	I'm a little worried
2024000	2025000	I saw it, let me put it this way, I saw Blockbuster yesterday
2026000	2027000	So I know it's out there, I don't know
2028000	2030000	It just, I looked at it and I'm like
2031000	2032000	Mama needs to fix her shipping dates, that's what she needs to fix
2033000	2034000	I'm like, I'm not even going to rent this
2035000	2036000	No thank you
2036000	2038000	I know I'm going to buy it because I'm dumb
2039000	2040000	Cookie Mama on the Wii
2041000	2042000	Oh my god, that looks so great, I want it
2043000	2044000	But it's been getting negative reviews everywhere
2045000	2046000	It looks great but it controls like crap
2047000	2048000	Why would you be excited for it?
2049000	2050000	Because you're a woman and you do that already
2051000	2052000	But not on a DS
2053000	2054000	On a Wii, stupid!
2055000	2056000	Or on a Wii, shut up
2057000	2058000	It's really disappointing that it controls like crap
2059000	2060000	Because I was hoping that it would be, it looked fun
2061000	2062000	And the DS one looked fun too
2062000	2065000	It's just, well there were some control issues
2066000	2067000	And it really, that frustrates the hell out of you
2068000	2069000	More comments from chat, I'm really relying on chat tonight
2070000	2071000	Because I have not been reading the internet this week
2072000	2074000	Zappy says the original Cookie Mama got bad reviews too
2075000	2076000	Because it had control issues
2077000	2078000	It has control issues
2079000	2081000	Let's see, Skylark makes a good point
2082000	2084000	And says, luckily Super Paper Mario comes out in a few weeks
2085000	2088000	What, you're booing Super Paper Mario, Mikotov?
2088000	2091000	The crap, what's wrong with Super Paper Mario, it looks great
2092000	2096000	I don't like it because it is a Paper Mario title
2097000	2098000	And I don't like Paper Mario games
2099000	2100000	And I know it's a freaking platformer game
2101000	2102000	But I'm sick of platformers
2103000	2105000	And I hate everything, so there
2106000	2108000	Well you heard about the Power Rangers game that's coming out
2109000	2110000	Just kidding, I got you
2111000	2112000	Sucker!
2112000	2117000	Blaze wanted to point out, Mikotov just won my love back, lol
2118000	2119000	No one makes Power Rangers games anymore
2120000	2122000	And GS68 says Cooking Milf
2123000	2125000	Maybe that'll be the sequel, Cooking Milf
2126000	2127000	That's wrong
2128000	2129000	Something else is wrong
2130000	2132000	Is removing the Emotion Engine out of the Playstation 3
2133000	2134000	To cut down costs
2135000	2136000	Granted, okay, I will give them this
2137000	2140000	It does now, they have with the new version 1.6 firmware
2140000	2144000	The original Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games
2145000	2146000	Actually I think more Playstation 2
2147000	2149000	Are emulated now with the Emotion
2150000	2152000	Like kind of a software emulation instead of hardware
2153000	2159000	So of the 2,451 Playstation 2 titles in the European region
2160000	2162000	Only 1,782 titles work
2163000	2164000	Which to be honest though
2165000	2166000	That's a lot better than the 360
2167000	2168000	That is a lot better than the 360
2168000	2170000	Of course, what does that really mean?
2171000	2172000	Because that's a lot of titles
2173000	2175000	But maybe it's a lot of barbie horse adventures type stuff
2176000	2178000	Really how much of this stuff am I going to want to play
2179000	2182000	And which games are working, not working, etc.
2183000	2185000	And I'm trying to remember here
2186000	2190000	I want to say of the list that they were saying that weren't working
2190000	2197000	I want to say Final Fantasy VII, Resident Evil 2, Ratchet and Clank, Metal Gear Solid 2
2198000	2200000	Those are some of the PS1 games that weren't working
2201000	2204000	And let's see, big name issues
2205000	2209000	There was 550 of the games that had noticeable issues
2210000	2211000	According to Sony
2212000	2215000	Among the big name titles like Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider 2 on the Playstation 1
2215000	2221000	Final Fantasy X, Kingdom Hearts, Sing Star, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas on the Playstation 2
2222000	2224000	Those are all ones that didn't work
2225000	2226000	Those are all ones that had noticeable issues
2227000	2228000	Lame
2229000	2230000	To be fair though
2231000	2235000	1700 titles for your system that are backwards compatible
2236000	2238000	A lot better than over 300 for the 360
2239000	2240000	I guess that's true
2241000	2242000	They're working on it
2242000	2246000	So give them some credit, that's a lot more than I was expecting to work with the system
2247000	2249000	They're doing something right at least
2250000	2252000	But I still think it's kind of crappy that it's software emulation now
2253000	2256000	Who cares though, I have one of the original Playstation 3's and it plays on hardware emulation
2257000	2258000	So who cares
2259000	2261000	Pardon me for a minute, I have a sidebar issue completely unrelated to take care of
2262000	2264000	Why is it when I got up to sneak to go use the bathroom
2265000	2267000	The magic of radio I can get up and leave and you don't even know
2267000	2274000	But yet I noticed in chat I suddenly said I'm Rob, I'm so flamey blah blah blah
2275000	2277000	Wow Rob you're amazing
2278000	2279000	I'm going to let you take a guess who said that
2280000	2281000	Yeah it was probably Miklotov
2282000	2283000	You're probably right
2284000	2285000	They're pointing back and forth at each other
2286000	2287000	You guys are jerks
2288000	2289000	Banned from the show forever
2292000	2293000	It was funny though
2293000	2298000	With the Playstation 1.6 firmware for the Playstation 3
2299000	2300000	You got some other stuff
2301000	2303000	Not just some backwards compatibility
2304000	2305000	Wait hold on I want to comment on the whole backwards compatibility thing
2306000	2307000	It sucks
2308000	2309000	That's all
2310000	2311000	Well here's the thing
2312000	2313000	What else is there to say
2314000	2315000	I don't know it's weird
2316000	2318000	But at the same time I do feel like if you're going to buy a Playstation 3
2318000	2323000	You know I called in to All Games Radio very randomly on Tuesday or Wednesday
2324000	2325000	One of the days before I leave to talk about this
2326000	2327000	And I kind of made a little joke
2328000	2329000	Because I don't know they were doing something on there
2330000	2332000	They were joking that the whole cast of OLR was at the Sony factory doing backwards compatibility
2333000	2334000	Don't ask I don't remember what it was
2335000	2337000	So I called in pretending to be at the Sony factory
2338000	2339000	I made this little joke about
2340000	2343000	If you're going to buy a Playstation 3 to play all your old Playstation 2 games
2344000	2346000	Maybe you ought to save $400 fucking dollars and buy a Playstation 2
2346000	2347000	Right fair
2348000	2349000	So I don't know why
2350000	2351000	At one point I do want to go well that kind of sucks
2352000	2353000	You can't play all your old games
2354000	2355000	But seeing as the system doesn't really upscale it yet
2356000	2357000	Like it was supposed to right
2358000	2360000	Actually the software emulation will allow it to upscale
2361000	2362000	So that is good
2363000	2364000	But it's not that big a deal
2365000	2366000	It's not that big a deal
2367000	2368000	It's not going to suddenly make your games HD beautiful blah blah blah
2369000	2370000	It's just going to be a little bit smoother
2371000	2372000	Honestly ask yourself
2372000	2375000	I mean really if you've got a Playstation 3
2376000	2378000	And you're really gearing to play some next gen games
2379000	2381000	Are you really playing Playstation 1 games?
2382000	2383000	I'm not I have Playstation 2 games
2384000	2385000	I have a Playstation 2 as well
2386000	2387000	I don't touch the thing
2388000	2389000	I don't play any of those games
2390000	2391000	I'm playing new stuff
2392000	2393000	If I really want to go back and play Kingdom Hearts 2 or whatever
2394000	2395000	I'll play it on my Playstation 2
2396000	2397000	I mean Playstation 2's are still selling really well
2398000	2399000	Exactly
2399000	2402000	They're sort of readily available out there
2403000	2404000	And they're not that expensive
2405000	2406000	And they'll probably drop in price again
2407000	2408000	Once we get down to Christmas time again
2409000	2410000	At the same time though
2411000	2412000	I do get a little irritated
2413000	2414000	Like when Xbox 360 talks about how they're going to abandon
2415000	2416000	Pretty much the old Xbox stuff come 2008
2417000	2418000	I think we had a story on that last week
2419000	2420000	And I know people go
2421000	2422000	Well why don't you just play it on your old Xbox blah blah blah blah
2423000	2424000	But I don't know
2425000	2426000	Sometimes I don't feel like cooking
2426000	2428000	I don't feel like cooking the game systems
2429000	2430000	So it is kind of convenient sometimes to be able to do the backwards compatibility thing
2431000	2432000	It is
2433000	2434000	And it's a nice thing that they've added
2435000	2436000	I mean since I think was it
2437000	2438000	The Playstation 2 was the first system to actually do that
2439000	2440000	And it was a great selling point
2441000	2441000	It plays all your Playstation 1 games
2442000	2443000	It actually makes them run a little bit better
2444000	2445000	You can do better graphics or you know
2446000	2447000	Better load times
2448000	2449000	So that was kind of cool
2450000	2451000	Which I might add
2452000	2453000	Playstation 3 load times kind of suck on certain games
2453000	2455000	If you were going to install it through the hard drive that would be really nice
2456000	2457000	But either way
2458000	2459000	It's still
2460000	2461000	I would say though
2462000	2463000	1700 games working for your system is a lot better than 300
2464000	2465000	Okay
2466000	2467000	That's something that they've got
2468000	2469000	But the Xbox did not have as big of a library as the Playstation 2
2470000	2473000	Because they didn't have anything before Xbox
2474000	2475000	Microsoft didn't compete with Playstation 1
2476000	2478000	And really I'm hoping that they do stick on
2479000	2480000	You know
2480000	2482000	The backwards compatibility instead of just saying
2483000	2484000	Ah fuck it you know we got this mini to work so
2485000	2486000	That's it
2487000	2488000	We're done
2489000	2491000	SSJ100Matt says it's funny that Microsoft killed the Xbox One right away
2492000	2494000	And Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 are still around
2495000	2496000	I don't know so much about Playstation 1
2497000	2498000	But certainly Playstation 2 still got quite a bit of life
2499000	2500000	It seems left in it
2501000	2502000	Oh yeah
2503000	2504000	I don't know if God of War 2 is like it's last gasp of air
2505000	2506000	Or if that's going to be the last big game
2507000	2508000	That may be the last Sony game
2508000	2509000	That may be the last games throughout the year
2510000	2511000	That are coming out for the Playstation 2
2512000	2513000	And I'm sure we'll get Sudoku Master for years to come
2514000	2515000	On Playstation 2
2516000	2517000	I played a lot of Sudoku
2518000	2519000	When you don't have a PSP or a DS
2520000	2521000	It's all about Sudoku
2522000	2523000	It's cheap to develop for
2524000	2525000	That's what it is
2526000	2527000	It's the one system that has the largest user base out there
2528000	2529000	Over three times of what the 360 has
2530000	2532000	And of course they're going to still make games for it
2533000	2534000	I mean 30 million people have the damn system
2535000	2536000	It would be dumb not to make games for it
2536000	2539000	But I mean certain games like the new Ghost Recon games
2540000	2541000	And stuff like that
2542000	2543000	You just can't do them on the Playstation 2
2544000	2545000	You've got to cut your costs
2546000	2547000	Either make the next gen version look pretty
2548000	2549000	Or just skip the current gen one
2550000	2551000	Maybe do something like EA is doing
2552000	2554000	Like Medal of Honor Vanguard for the Wii and Playstation 2
2555000	2556000	And then make a new one
2557000	2558000	Medal of Honor Airborne
2559000	2561000	For the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360
2562000	2563000	That way everybody's happy
2563000	2566000	And they've saved their costs a little bit on the games
2567000	2570000	That don't necessarily need the huge graphic budgets
2571000	2572000	And stuff like that
2573000	2574000	Let me quickly go to another sidebar comment
2575000	2576000	And then we'll get back into the news here
2577000	2578000	The comments from the chat room
2579000	2580000	This is an interesting conversation
2581000	2582000	JVmon says, if you have a Playstation 3
2583000	2584000	Why the hell are you still playing Final Fantasy 7?
2585000	2587000	And then ShadowNextGen says, JVmon Final Fantasy 7 is a classic
2588000	2589000	That I will always play
2590000	2591000	And then moving on
2591000	2594000	Let's see, JVmon says then play it on your Playstation 2
2595000	2596000	And Hippolytus says this
2597000	2599000	He says, I for example never owned a Playstation
2600000	2601000	I think he means PS1
2602000	2603000	But now that I have a Playstation 2
2604000	2605000	I can play Playstation 1 games
2606000	2607000	But that begs the comment
2608000	2610000	How many people do you know that's actually going to go get a Playstation 3
2611000	2612000	Who never had a Playstation 2?
2613000	2614000	But I do know of one person
2615000	2617000	I do have a friend who's considering getting a Playstation 3
2618000	2619000	And he never had a Playstation 2 or a Playstation 1
2619000	2620000	He's thinking about getting it
2621000	2622000	Because he can play all the backwards compatible stuff
2623000	2624000	In this country you still can
2625000	2626000	If this is a big concern for them
2627000	2628000	I would recommend that they do
2629000	2630000	And it's going to be a different SKU
2631000	2632000	Or a slightly different item
2633000	2634000	Not item member
2635000	2636000	They're Sony item members
2637000	2638000	Either way, you're going to be able to look on the box
2639000	2640000	And tell which version of the Playstation 3 this is
2641000	2642000	The one that has
2643000	2644000	One of the original launch ones
2645000	2646000	Or one of the ones that got the
2646000	2648000	65 nanometer chips in them
2649000	2650000	And it's software emulation now
2651000	2653000	So if it's a real big concern for your backwards compatibility
2654000	2655000	Make sure you get one of the older ones
2656000	2657000	And that's all you really need to do
2658000	2659000	Or buy an older one that's used or something
2660000	2661000	I'd recommend that's the case
2662000	2663000	Because really it's going to drop in price
2664000	2665000	Probably in the fall
2666000	2667000	I mean they probably will need to
2668000	2669000	Especially if Microsoft drops their price
2670000	2671000	But the thing is
2672000	2673000	That it's going to come at a cost
2673000	2675000	You're not going to have that chip on there
2676000	2677000	And they've already said they're going to take it out
2678000	2679000	For the US ones
2680000	2681000	So if it's a real big deal for you
2682000	2683000	Maybe spend the extra money
2684000	2685000	I mean it's either that or you're going to spend another
2686000	2687000	$99 on a Playstation 2
2688000	2689000	So pick your poison
2690000	2691000	I mean this way you get a larger hard drive
2692000	2693000	With it at the same time
2694000	2695000	You can buy a more expensive system or something
2696000	2697000	I don't know
2698000	2699000	Anyways
2700000	2701000	So back to the Playstation 3 1.6
2701000	2702000	Oh firmware that's out there
2703000	2704000	Finally they've added
2705000	2706000	Background downloading
2707000	2708000	Something that they should have had from the beginning
2709000	2710000	Because this thing downloads like
2711000	2712000	Fucking slow
2713000	2714000	Well to be fair 360 didn't have it at first
2715000	2716000	It badly needed it too
2717000	2718000	But I would have hoped that since
2719000	2720000	The Playstation 3 came out a year later
2721000	2722000	That they would kind of learn from
2723000	2724000	I'll give you that
2725000	2726000	Either way so now it does work
2727000	2729000	And it is confirmed that it will work
2729000	2730000	While you're watching a blu-ray movie
2731000	2732000	Or playing an offline game
2733000	2734000	Not an online game
2735000	2736000	Basically the same rules as a 360
2737000	2738000	So that's kind of cool
2739000	2740000	Another thing
2741000	2742000	Well and also kind of another thing
2743000	2744000	Why would you really need background downloading
2745000	2746000	Because there's not a lot to download on the store right now
2747000	2748000	So anyways
2749000	2750000	Another thing that does add
2751000	2752000	And this is kind of neat
2753000	2754000	Is that folding at home
2755000	2756000	That basically the kind of program
2756000	2758000	That runs in the background to help
2759000	2760000	Crunch numbers to figure out
2761000	2763000	How to come up with cures for diseases and whatnot
2764000	2765000	Interesting enough
2766000	2767000	This was released this week
2768000	2769000	The firmware update
2770000	2771000	And already the Playstation 3
2772000	2775000	Is processing a lot more
2776000	2777000	Numbers than anything else
2778000	2779000	In fact even more than
2780000	2781000	Most of the Windows PC's out there
2782000	2784000	Right now they are currently
2784000	2785000	Doing what was it
2786000	2787000	251 teraflops
2788000	2789000	Which you know that's
2790000	2791000	100 trillion
2792000	2793000	More than
2794000	2795000	They were saying that
2796000	2797000	The Playstation 3 machines are delivering
2798000	2799000	Over 251 trillion
2800000	2801000	Floating point operations per second
2802000	2803000	100 trillion more than
2804000	2805000	10 times the number of
2806000	2807000	Active PC CPU's
2808000	2809000	Is this folding at home thing
2810000	2811000	Forgive my ignorance a little bit
2811000	2813000	Because I don't have a Playstation 3 so I haven't been really following this very much
2814000	2815000	But is this something that you
2816000	2818000	It automatically kind of stealth installs in your Playstation 3
2819000	2820000	And just runs without you knowing it
2821000	2822000	I think you have to download this
2823000	2824000	Or it's basically a
2825000	2826000	I'm not sure if it's included with the update
2827000	2828000	If it is included with the update it's a program you have to run
2829000	2830000	It runs almost like a screen saver
2831000	2832000	And it will crunch numbers
2833000	2834000	But yet for a PC
2835000	2836000	You would have to elect to download this
2837000	2838000	And kind of seek it out right
2838000	2840000	Yes but the thing is though you have to run it
2841000	2842000	In order for it to actually run
2843000	2844000	It's not something that will run automatically
2845000	2846000	So
2847000	2848000	Kind of like distributed net
2849000	2850000	Because I used to run that back in college
2851000	2852000	It's basically like the old study at home
2853000	2854000	Little cow icon
2855000	2856000	Except you know now instead of searching
2857000	2858000	For extraterrestrial life
2859000	2860000	Because I guess they gave up on that
2861000	2862000	Instead of that they're looking to
2863000	2864000	You know
2865000	2866000	Cure cancer
2866000	2867000	I can't wait for the press release
2868000	2869000	When one of these Playstation 3's
2870000	2871000	Happens to crunch the magical number
2872000	2873000	To cure cancer
2874000	2875000	Sony cures cancer
2876000	2877000	I mean I can see that PR right now
2878000	2879000	Joshi16 in chat says
2880000	2881000	Cure cancer
2882000	2883000	1000 gamer points and a home trophy
2884000	2885000	There you go
2886000	2887000	Yeah I want the cure cancer trophy
2888000	2889000	Anyways
2890000	2891000	On to a completely different system and subject
2892000	2893000	This rumor of the
2893000	2895000	Black Xbox 360 just will never die
2896000	2898000	And it's now confirmed to be real
2899000	2900000	Probably why the rumor never died
2901000	2903000	And the latest issue of Game Informer magazine
2904000	2905000	Which further goes to show
2906000	2908000	Microsoft rumors 90% of the time
2909000	2910000	Unless you made it up yourself
2911000	2912000	Microsoft rumors are always true
2913000	2914000	Always true
2915000	2918000	It has been announced at least through
2919000	2920000	According to the article in Game Informer
2920000	2922000	Not officially announced yet but anyways
2923000	2926000	An HDMI enabled black unit
2927000	2929000	Is coming out for $479
2930000	2931000	It's going to be a limited edition
2932000	2933000	In black it will be in white later
2934000	2935000	But limited edition for
2936000	2937000	Yeah $479
2938000	2939000	And
2940000	2941000	It's supposed to have a larger hard drive
2942000	2943000	120 gigabytes
2944000	2947000	And other rumored options with this
2947000	2949000	Is that it's supposed to also have black accessories
2950000	2951000	Coming out for it
2952000	2953000	So eventually you'll see different colored controllers and whatnot
2954000	2956000	And one thing also they were talking about
2957000	2960000	Is the IPTV is supposed to be enabled in it as well
2961000	2962000	So that's something interesting
2963000	2964000	If you've already spent the money though
2965000	2966000	On your 360
2967000	2968000	You'll be happy to know there will be a larger hard drive
2969000	2971000	Coming out for under $200
2972000	2974000	And the other rumor with that is
2974000	2977000	That there is going to be a data cable included with the new 360
2978000	2981000	And a new hard drive that will allow you to be able to hook up your old hard drive
2982000	2983000	To transfer any saves you have
2984000	2985000	So I hope that's true
2986000	2989000	Well Microsoft rumors usually end up being true
2990000	2991000	So that would make sense
2992000	2993000	But interesting
2994000	2996000	I don't know I can't get too excited about the black Xbox 360
2997000	3000000	Because I think well the first Xbox was black and nobody cared
3001000	3002000	Well it's going to be called the elite
3002000	3004000	I mean that's what they're calling it right now
3005000	3007000	The core system is not going away
3008000	3009000	The premium system is not going away
3010000	3012000	It's basically this is just going to be another skew that's added on
3013000	3016000	And eventually it will become a white system
3017000	3019000	I'm not sure if it's going to replace the premium system or not
3020000	3022000	But they're going to eventually all be white
3023000	3026000	So I don't know it's interesting
3027000	3028000	Hopefully we'll see a price drop for the core
3029000	3030000	Because that would be kind of nice
3030000	3032000	I heard they're ditching the core
3033000	3034000	I don't know
3035000	3037000	I would think they would because they want to urge people to download movies and stuff
3038000	3039000	So that means you have to have a hard drive right
3040000	3043000	Yeah but at the same time they want to still be able to compete against the Wii and stuff
3044000	3046000	I mean they've got to have that lower price point out there
3047000	3048000	Drop the premium to $299 there you go
3049000	3051000	Yeah that would be good
3052000	3054000	I think if they do a price drop to drop it to $299
3055000	3058000	They could keep the core around for like $199 or something like that
3058000	3062000	If they're not going to keep it around then so be it
3063000	3065000	So they'll have a unit that's not out there
3066000	3071000	Shadownextgen says a new Xbox 360 hard drive for under $200 equals $199.99
3072000	3074000	If I were to guess actually
3075000	3079000	I can't remember because originally the core system
3080000	3083000	It was $299 and the hard drive is $99
3084000	3086000	So that would equal $399 roughly
3086000	3088000	This is $479
3089000	3091000	So I don't know
3092000	3094000	Core system plus new hard drive
3095000	3097000	I'm guessing the hard drive is $179.99
3098000	3099000	That would be my guess
3100000	3103000	Blaze says Sky new colors always make people go ooooh
3104000	3107000	I don't know I kind of like the white because for my setup it's kind of nice
3108000	3110000	Because my Ikea TV table is a light color
3111000	3113000	And then you have the white Wii on one side and the white Xbox 360 on the other side
3113000	3115000	Everything looks nice
3116000	3119000	Rob you got to understand though people are stupid and they will buy different colored stuff
3120000	3123000	I can understand for the HDMI cable the bigger hard drive and that stuff
3124000	3126000	I don't know I'm not going to get it
3127000	3131000	I might get the new hard drive or something if I really need it or something
3132000	3136000	But I don't need the HDMI my TV doesn't have HDMI so that's a big deal
3136000	3142000	Black I couldn't give a crap if the thing was bright green or pink or something
3143000	3144000	Who cares
3145000	3148000	Ravenstaufen wants to know if you've seen this through your insider sources
3149000	3153000	Nope because certain companies will not talk about stuff before it needs to be out there
3154000	3158000	Certain companies are a little better about keeping tabs on that stuff than others
3159000	3163000	Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony they're an expert in the PR department
3163000	3166000	And they will not leak crap like this out there
3167000	3169000	In fact I'm surprised that it would even be out there in some of those system stuff
3170000	3172000	Unless they're doing like test stuff I don't know
3173000	3176000	But yeah this stuff will not be out there until they want it to be out there
3177000	3178000	Anyways
3179000	3181000	So other stuff about that
3182000	3184000	Well actually they don't really have anything else other than that
3185000	3187000	Hopefully April I mean it's not that far away so
3188000	3190000	If we're going to hear an update about this it's going to be pretty damn soon
3190000	3194000	So keep your eyes peeled for an actual press release about this
3195000	3196000	And hopefully more exciting stuff to come from
3197000	3199000	Does Microsoft have any events coming up in April where they could drop this bombshell
3200000	3203000	No but I think they're getting close to the end of their fiscal year
3204000	3206000	So I don't know
3207000	3209000	That might be good to make boost stock prices or something
3210000	3214000	Anyways on to the final new system out there the Wii
3214000	3220000	They are getting the final version of the internet channel towards the end of April
3221000	3226000	And it's supposed to be having some more features added to it
3227000	3228000	I believe they're improving the
3229000	3231000	Like getting rid of that goddamn bar that sits at the bottom of your page?
3232000	3235000	I hope so I can't remember I have to find the exact details for it
3236000	3240000	But I remember improved zooming auto resizing of text
3240000	3245000	I think they're improving the little virtual keyboard that's on there
3246000	3250000	So that has like some more preset stuff like www. and html and stuff like that
3251000	3252000	So that stuff on there
3253000	3256000	Hopefully they're removing the little bar on there
3257000	3263000	And I think they're extending the free web browser until June now
3264000	3267000	Well that's a nice thing to do considering a lot of people that want to get Wii still can't get them
3267000	3275000	The web browser is five bucks when they start charging for it
3276000	3279000	I don't know I can't see how that would be
3280000	3285000	You know the Wii web browser has been getting a little bit of play in this house
3286000	3287000	Because we use it for YouTube
3288000	3291000	When there's like seven people over we want to show something funny on YouTube
3292000	3295000	Like hey look at this Kelly video on YouTube because you're the only person on the planet that still hasn't seen it
3295000	3300000	We'll go to YouTube and bring it up on the TV and it's kind of cool except for that bar
3301000	3303000	That sits at the bottom of the page and kind of eats up all the space
3304000	3305000	Or porno tube
3306000	3308000	Or porno tube is also yeah I remember the New Year's party good times
3309000	3310000	Good times
3311000	3313000	Yes it's a gateway to porn
3315000	3316000	Anyways
3317000	3319000	Back on the subject of the Wii here
3320000	3323000	EAA announced a brand new game for the Wii called Boogie
3323000	3325000	This was I think we had covered a story
3326000	3330000	They were talking about how there was going to be a 70's style music game coming out for the Wii
3331000	3332000	And I believe this is it
3333000	3334000	Is this the harmonix partnership?
3335000	3336000	No
3337000	3338000	Because there's that going on too right?
3339000	3342000	I seem to remember last week there was some sort of from game developers conference
3343000	3346000	EA said we're going to get in bed with harmonix for one game type thing going on
3347000	3348000	Is this related?
3349000	3350000	I don't think this has anything to do with harmonix
3350000	3352000	Alright just curious
3353000	3358000	It's basically a Wii exclusive game and you're going to be using the nunchuck as well as the remotes to disco dance
3359000	3363000	And your character kind of looks almost like I don't know definitely not human
3364000	3366000	But there's these evil looking peak men things in the background
3367000	3368000	Everybody disco dancing
3369000	3370000	So it's interesting what they're doing with that
3371000	3373000	Could be kind of fun I don't know
3374000	3376000	So I'm looking forward to it
3376000	3380000	That should be out later this year of course no specific anything
3381000	3382000	Still a little vague for me
3383000	3386000	I want to know more about like you know were there videos out there of people playing it
3387000	3388000	Pictures
3389000	3390000	Looks pretty good
3391000	3393000	Another thing that was announced or at least reconfirmed
3394000	3397000	Guitar Hero for the Wii is supposed to be coming out
3398000	3402000	And they're saying that they're going to actually be doing controllers as well that look like guitars
3403000	3404000	Not a big surprise
3404000	3408000	And yeah kind of going back to when they were talking about
3409000	3411000	Wait they're going to make controllers that look like guitars?
3412000	3413000	That's what they were saying
3414000	3416000	But wouldn't that be a given because Guitar Hero uses a guitar controller
3417000	3421000	Or are they saying that feasibly you're going to be able to play this game with no special controller
3422000	3423000	I think they're actually making new controllers for it
3424000	3425000	Because
3425000	3433000	Yeah they said it says the Colt rhythm game Guitar Hero is on its way to the Wii it comes with a guitar shaped controller
3434000	3436000	And plays convincingly enough to make you think you're making real music
3437000	3440000	Hopefully we'll get the actual guitar and not pretend we're up
3441000	3442000	So it's speculation never mind
3443000	3446000	So no idea if they're going to actually have a real guitar thing
3447000	3450000	I would hope that they're going to if they want to cut costs you know
3450000	3454000	Just make a plugin for like the Wiimote you know stick it in there
3455000	3459000	I mean because the things made to build off of it you know that's why they have that stupid little
3460000	3463000	Almost like a USB thing on the bottom for all those attachments
3464000	3468000	Build something that works onto it like slide the guitar or the Wiimote into the guitar
3469000	3473000	I don't like this whole thinning of the Guitar Hero franchise amongst all the consoles you know
3474000	3477000	I already passed on Guitar Hero 2 for Playstation because I knew the 360 version was coming
3477000	3485000	And now I don't know I don't know what the Wii version is going to have to really have something special to make me want to buy another guitar controller
3486000	3489000	And another you know I kind of wish they would put out a guitar that would just work on all the systems
3490000	3491000	Kind of like you can get DDR pads to do that
3492000	3493000	Yeah
3494000	3495000	I'll be nice
3496000	3499000	Then let's see here have one more story and I think you talked about this a little bit last week Rob
3499000	3507000	And it's been finally confirmed a Nintendo rep has confirmed individual friends list for the Wii titles
3508000	3515000	So yes they have worked they have done nothing to change the fucking hassle that was DS friends list system
3516000	3524000	And basically they've said I can confirm that the friend code system in the Wi-Fi connection service for the Wii will be the same as it was for the Nintendo DS
3524000	3532000	Meaning game specific friend codes and separate friends rosters are used in each game where players can play with identified friends
3533000	3539000	As with the Nintendo DS the system was created to ensure gaming environment is kept fun for everyone
3540000	3544000	Except for the people that have to enter in the 5000 codes for each damn game
3545000	3547000	Retarded
3548000	3552000	I just I don't know I talked about this so I was blue in the face last night I just don't get it
3552000	3557000	Rice Brothers you weren't here last week what do you think of this whole friend codes thing on the Wii
3558000	3561000	That you're going to have to basically enter in your friend code every time to get new players
3562000	3563000	What that's dumb
3564000	3567000	Like you do on the DS right you know how you do that on the DS you enter a friend code now you have to do the same thing on the Wii
3568000	3572000	Even though we already put in friend codes to send the messages back and forth you have to do it for every single game
3573000	3577000	Because heaven forbid you get a I don't know a predator on Wii or something
3577000	3584000	I hope I hope that these that this is something that's not required for like third parties or something this this could be fun
3585000	3591000	I'm fine with the first party stuff if they're doing what they want to do that great but I you know so far with like Konami
3592000	3600000	They have a little bit so we connect 24 stuff you know I'm I don't know I don't well I guess that's not really playing with anyone online though
3600000	3610000	That's just exchanging like levels or something so I still think it's retarded though it why would you want to be a friend in one game and not another
3611000	3618000	I why it doesn't make any sense no sense whatsoever I don't understand why they have to complicate things
3619000	3627000	And I'm sure they got an over you know what was the response to the DS one I mean no one I think actually was positive on it
3627000	3635000	Everyone was like this fucking sucks so what would make you decide hmm people really hated it before let's do it again that'd be awesome
3636000	3639000	I mean really what was the thought behind this I don't get it
3640000	3641000	Maybe there wasn't any thought
3642000	3646000	I mean people aren't really being kidnapped with the goddamn DS I mean seriously
3647000	3655000	Skylark says friend codes are horrible haven't Nintendo learned anything I'd rather take the risk of meeting child molesters than not be able to play online at all
3655000	3664000	And really how hard is it anyways to add someone I mean you just put in a friend code it's basically like accepting like hitting yes or something
3665000	3677000	I mean people you they won't people can add you to their friends list but you have to add them back first so it would be just like you know if I send a friend request to somebody they don't have to agree to do it
3678000	3683000	So why just leave it as yes no instead of numbers I don't know why you have to complicate things
3683000	3692000	Maury in our chat room live on this Sunday evening at chat.org.com says it's a really flawed system especially considering Nintendo's justification
3693000	3701000	Qwhat5565 says Nintendo can't be that stupid they have to be coming out with an easier add-on maybe a report button
3701000	3712000	Well I mean here let me put it this way we still got time until the first you know online game comes out this could change before then
3713000	3719000	But not really because we've had Elibits and that worked fine but I know you don't play versus or whatever but
3719000	3730000	I'm just saying right now though they could change I hope they change it I mean I really do because it's just a pain in the ass it really is
3731000	3738000	I'm glad that they want to protect the children out there from you know child molesters and stuff to be honest I don't think you're really gonna have that problem
3738000	3748000	Because you don't have video chat you don't really have voice chat you don't have even normal chat it's just fucking exchanging messages back and forth like you know email
3749000	3758000	I don't see what the big deal is just just put yes or no I mean is that so hard instead of having to enter and people put their damn friend codes on websites anyways
3759000	3763000	And they exchange them that way so how is that any different than you know yes or no
3763000	3772000	You know what we should do is create a website childmolesterfriendcodes.com and like encourage you know people to use the friend code systems to meet child molesters
3773000	3784000	Obviously I'm joking people but you know I mean Loki brings up a good point you can trade codes online with complete strangers who might turn out to be people you don't expect them to be I don't get it
3784000	3794000	I don't get it either because if you know someone ends up being creepy or something you delete their friend code or for example with Xbox Live you just befriend them
3795000	3796000	Whoa that's
3797000	3799000	Or push the button that reports them it's not that hard although I know a lot of people don't use it
3800000	3807000	I mean how hard is it I mean people oh no people are gonna send you like stupid messages oh it's so hard to just delete them I mean
3807000	3815000	I just don't understand why they have to make extra hoops to jump through for a system that can be so simple
3816000	3822000	Rant rant rant rant rant jumpman says historically Nintendo hasn't been great with new technology look at the virtual boy
3823000	3830000	Skylark says how do they honestly think friend codes are a good idea if they do anything they prevent us from playing together totally not we
3830000	3839000	Making a little play on that play together line get it GS68 says how to meet child molesters come down to the Silicon Valley area and take the line 22 bus after 10pm
3840000	3848000	Well here's the thing it's like okay I have a huge list of friends or whatever that you know I've got in my Wii system right now
3849000	3856000	I get you know not that I would actually play Pokemon I get Pokemon battle revolution or something like that great I want to play against my friends
3856000	3865000	Oh no wait no I can't do that because I have to email all my damn friends now with the Wii system and say hey what's your friend code for Pokemon battle revolution
3866000	3873000	Because I can't play you until you know I get this so it may take me a couple days before I'm actually able to play the game online with friends
3874000	3879000	Hooray mission accomplished you've really you know embraced online
3880000	3883000	Well I think there's only one thing left to say about all of this
3883000	3897000	That would be the FUs of the week for the second week in a row inspired by Nintendo friend codes
3898000	3901000	No dark soccer tonight so Loki you get first dibs
3902000	3909000	My FU goes to drama I hate drama and I hate drama that's unnecessary I'll leave it at that for now
3909000	3920000	My FU goes to bullies they come in all shapes and sizes and fortune 500 sizes and bullies are not cool
3921000	3929000	And double standards suck as well I really hate double standards I really really really really hate when you see one thing applied this way here
3930000	3935000	And then it's applied totally or a blind eye is turned over here I think that's stupid
3935000	3938000	That's all. Rice Princess do you have anything you want to share?
3939000	3949000	Well I second both of your FUs but yes so FU to immaturity yes that's pretty much it I'm not going to get into specifics yep
3950000	3957000	Oh and one last thing some very vague FUs this week FU to the last Mimsy because it just got ridiculous towards the end really ridiculous
3957000	3965000	Some chat room folks are entering honorary FUs on behalf of dark sakura for not being here
3966000	3972000	Joshi16 says dark sakura FU to fucking drivers drivers suck I hate them they should die in a fire Kingdom Hearts rules no FU to them
3972000	3988000	That's great oh drunami says FU to e-sluts on myspace yes amen you know I've been gone for 4 days so I logged into myspace I swear to god 15 e-sluts that is going to kill myspace just like slowness killed fredster it really is
3989000	3993000	It would not be that hard for myspace to institute some way to get around that
3994000	3995000	I think they kind of are right now
3995000	4002000	Well they have that whole thing where you can know my last name and get around it that way so I'm thinking about putting this big thing on my profile that says my last name is roberts
4003000	4011000	You know because I've used my fake last name that I use on the radio on myspace profile so that people in my real life I don't want to find me can't find me because they don't know my stage name
4012000	4022000	So I'm thinking about just putting that really big so that the cam girls are cool and they can't at least shut it off turn it on for a little while and hopefully it will get them to stop hitting my profile I don't know
4022000	4033000	Just do what I do robin just not check myspace after you know once every 2 weeks or something because by the time you get back there most of the profiles have been deleted anyways
4034000	4045000	I like getting the ads from listeners of the show and things of that you know and people that I you know meet in my real life who I tell how to find my profile and all that stuff
4045000	4053000	You know I like getting that I don't like having to wait through the cam horse to do it but that's you know there's that all games community site which is pretty rad as well
4054000	4057000	Rice Princess you should sign up for that because they talk games on there a lot
4058000	4064000	Did you? I don't know well maybe you did it while I've been gone I haven't checked the site in a few days there could have been some great blog posts I don't even know
4064000	4077000	I have some game review haikus I have to catch up on for the community site so that's community.allgames.com our buddies over there at all games have set up there their answer to myspace minus the cam horse plus all the gaming chat
4078000	4079000	Really? Yes it's good times
4080000	4081000	But I might have to go there
4082000	4083000	You'll probably get a lot of friend ads because OMG a chick
4084000	4085000	Oh ok
4086000	4087000	I'm going to go in as a dude
4087000	4098000	You get a lot of cool people over there it's a good community because all listeners of this show and all games and you know all the other shows that are on allgames.com about the six or seven other indie podcasts they have that are on that network so it's cool
4099000	4100000	Yeah I'll check it out
4101000	4102000	Good times
4102000	4116000	Ok Tigerclaw wants to know if I check the games and porn community site as well apparently all games has these two spin off community sites one of them is rhythm nation which is for like music based games and the other one is games and porn
4117000	4120000	I've not looked at games and porn yet but rice princess that sounds right up your alley
