487	5570	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5891	14737	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15457	19139	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19900	27465	And we are back on Orange Lounge Radio here with part B of our podcast, or audio blog, audio cast, whatever you want to call it.
28010	31231	It's the audio archive of our program, and it's split up into two parts.
31871	36471	Part A is released usually early, early Monday morning, late Sunday night, however you want to look at it.
36491	40452	Part B comes out sometime on Wednesday, whenever we get around to uploading it.
40892	44913	But this is the second half of a continuing show that is taped live on Sunday nights.
45393	47713	And if you feel like coming down for a show, you should join us.
48453	51174	www.orangeloungeradio.com We have a chat room.
51354	51854	Hi, chat room.
52254	57075	And you missed our great bonus segment and things you can only hear live or on our rebroadcast at allgames.com.
57851	59412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
76437	78158	Starting off this segment with some pretty big news.
78178	80000	It has to do with the Halo 3 beta.
80340	84403	Rumor is that the Halo 3 beta is going to be split into two sessions.
84824	87446	The first session will begin on March 21st.
87866	90788	Seems pretty bold that these predictions are naming dates.
90848	95092	But this is from Xbox Portugal, who also brought the first Halo 3 beta screenshots.
95432	98915	The first session will only be for those that got emails from Bungie.
99175	100616	That starts March 21st.
100896	104459	The second session will be also open to those who bought Crackdown.
104879	107800	That will end in June, but no start date given for that yet.
108100	110480	But, Loki, you were telling me during the break you heard this is bullshit.
110540	111661	Yeah, I heard it's bullshit.
111801	112681	How is it proven wrong?
112941	117802	I think it was either someone at Microsoft or someone at Bungie that said that it would just be one giant session.
118102	119583	That they weren't going to do two different ones.
121043	121783	Well, there you have it.
122423	124524	So, Xbox Portugal lies.
125264	125724	Maybe not.
125744	126964	It's just miscommunications.
128885	132606	Loki said Halo 3 would be coming out in the spring, which was also a lie.
133026	134186	So, there you have it.
135982	136502	Lies!
136902	139383	You should be ashamed.
139643	139823	No.
141503	154126	Something, though, that actually is pretty cool, as announced in OXM, the Halo theme is going to be a downloadable track for Guitar Hero 2.
156666	157427	I think that's pretty cool.
160279	169501	It's definitely going to be something that I think is going to get a lot of people to look more into those downloaded tracks and something that's going to make a little bit of revenue.
169561	170041	So why not?
170061	170582	That would be cool.
172402	173722	Hey, here it's going to be free.
173742	176423	Does that make sense?
177303	177903	I like free.
178503	180664	And yeah, it would be a good promotion for the Halo 3 game.
181184	185265	What I also want to know, though, is can Master Chief be one of the guitarists that you can play as?
185405	185765	That would be cool.
185785	186285	That would be awesome.
186305	188666	Because it was pretty awesome to have Master Chief in Dead or Alive 4.
190080	191121	Well, it wasn't Master Chief.
191441	191981	Spartan.
192141	192822	Female Spartan.
193542	194063	Whatever.
194203	196585	You know, having a Halo character in the game was kind of funny.
196705	198546	So, Mistress Chief.
198686	199307	Sorry, my bad.
199327	200908	That would be Chieftess.
202249	211055	Anyway, so yes, one of my favorite topics of discussion is how people are hacking firmwares on consoles.
211815	219561	And one very famous group, Team Executor, one of the ones I think pioneered some of the homebrew stuff on the PSP,
220714	225461	have broken the firmware for the Xbox 360.
226522	230448	Now, right now, there's apparently a...
231877	242721	and they can't disclose too much but there is a glitch in one of the older firmwares for the 360 that will allow you to use a copy of King Kong to run your own code.
242801	251024	Kind of similar to what they're doing with some of the older firmwares on the PSP where you could run homebrew with Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.
252185	261168	Apparently one of the shaders I guess that was in King Kong was actually unsigned and so they could buffer overflow it and cause it to run their own
262118	272867	And they actually released a proof of concept, I think like Hello World or something like that, that you can run on your 360 if you happen to have this firmware.
272887	276611	And apparently there's a way to check it by going to your system menu and stuff like that.
277071	289762	But like I said, if you're getting your automatic updates on live like most people are, you probably have already patched the hole in this because the problem has been patched in some of the future firmwares.
289862	290042	So...
291789	298311	Basically, right now, there's no way to roll back the firmware, kind of like you can do on the PSP.
298731	308715	Although, if you have the older firmware, there is apparently a thing you can break on the motherboard or something that you can do that will allow you to be able to roll it back no matter what firmware you have later on.
308915	309835	So, I don't know.
310515	313336	I was going to say, can't Microsoft just patch this right away?
313597	314137	They can.
314877	315517	They're pretty good.
315897	320679	Of all the companies, they're the fastest at closing up these loopholes real quick.
321621	321841	Yeah.
322282	333951	At least on the 360, not so much Windows XP, but... And right now, really, I don't think there's a way, I mean, you can really detect this because it's, you know, it's being run in a game almost.
334031	343699	It's loading with a game, so unless they just ban the use of King Kong altogether, it's going to be pretty hard for them to, you know, stop it altogether.
344479	344920	I don't know, though.
345140	350084	But, I mean, they've already pretty much done, they've patched the whole for this, so...
351770	353031	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
381281	387443	Vulnerability, and it's found in kernel versions 4532 and 4548.
388863	399285	So apparently if you pull up your Xbox 360 under the system menu and look up system information, there's a little thing on the bottom of the screen.
399485	402606	It says D, and then there's a bunch of numbers, and then K and a bunch of numbers.
402686	410028	If your kernel says 2.0 point and then either the 40 or the, what was it,
411761	413322	Christ is a lot of specifics.
441917	445501	Oh yes, because the rampant piracy will certainly make the games even better.
446822	447583	That was sarcasm.
449045	450526	Hasn't hurt the PS2 anymore.
451928	452528	Or the PSP.
453890	462319	Well, there are some franchises that every so often will rear their ugly heads over the course of video gaming history.
463220	463440	Well...
465254	467436	Prince of Persia, not so stabity.
494418	501662	Just, you know, I was never a fan of the Prince of Persia games, so I'm like, wow.
502383	503043	They're not bad.
503203	504044	The new ones aren't bad.
504324	509567	I don't think they're quite like, oh my god, as a lot of people have said they are, but I played some of the older ones on GameTap.
510368	510848	They're not bad.
511848	515411	For a 3D action type game, they're pretty solid.
515471	517192	It was a pretty good game, and...
518678	519078	I don't know.
519138	520099	I can see why it does as well.
520239	525082	They have the one coming off the Wii, the Port of Two Thrones, I guess, but it rivals swords, I guess.
525703	528324	Calling it something new because they added some chariot racing in there.
529005	533748	But, I mean, if you like Prince Persia, that's going to be a pretty cool game to check out.
533848	535048	So, I don't know.
535629	540132	But another cool thing, though, about Prince of Persia is it's becoming a movie as well.
540612	546996	And Disney is behind this as well as Jerry Brockheimer.
547810	549911	They're bringing Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time.
550211	551272	And it is legit.
551332	553213	They've got some concept art on it.
554394	555475	That's pretty cool.
556215	558937	I mean, I think the Sands of Time... Didn't Disney already put out Aladdin?
560758	561138	Yes.
561718	564120	But I think it would be a pretty cool action movie.
564620	565480	I'm looking forward to it.
566441	568462	So, just don't fuck it up.
568582	575406	You might actually have, if they pull it off, you might have a really good movie translation for a game.
575927	576467	You know, because...
577449	578149	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
602742	606444	Also, of course, you can download movies on iTunes, and you can download music.
606944	609365	And for those wondering, where's all the gaming music?
610326	615849	Well, Electronic Arts has launched the EA Tracks service as a part of iTunes.
616369	619270	And basically what they've done is they've compiled all the EA games.
621511	628955	The interesting thing is they said, music from all EA games, past and present, now available on the iTunes Store.
629620	637607	Well, okay, but, you know, when you say all EA games past and present, that makes me go, wow, you mean I could even go to the ECA games from the Commodore 64 days?
637827	637947	No.
638648	644152	Basically what that means, like, you know, your burnouts, your sports games with the licensed music, you know, the Maddens.
644312	645813	Any of the games with EA tracks.
645833	646214	You got it.
646334	650958	Those EA tracks, you can download those songs on iTunes, so there you go.
651298	655101	Did you know that Burnout Dominator is supposed to have Avril Lavigne's girlfriend in it?
655742	657203	Which, oh boy.
658848	659869	That's a pretty bad song.
661129	664171	I like the last one she did for the movie, but this song's bad.
664851	667332	That's not something I would want the EA name on.
667592	670034	Would it make you want to crash into things?
671234	672355	That's a very good point.
672835	677077	If it's true that there's pedestrians in the next Burnout game, it would make me want to run over them.
677418	679038	Dominator would not have pedestrians.
679279	679619	Damn it!
680499	684001	Dominator's kind of a best-of built off the Revenge engine, I believe.
686124	686544	DarkSakura.com
705785	706626	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
737562	747071	The first email of the week, without the sexy commentary, actually comes from... Email number one.
747291	749533	Hey Rob, shut up.
749593	750894	Comes from Heon.
751815	753857	Dear OLR, first of all, I absolutely love the show.
753877	756700	You guys are excellent radio show hosts and are very talented.
757080	760003	Thank you so much for making the show so fun by interacting with your audience.
760726	764809	On to my questions, Super Mario Bros., Ocarina of Time, Kid Icarus, A Link to the Past.
765610	769393	These are just several of the classics that are currently available on the North American Virtual Console.
769813	771315	It's been only four months.
771855	773697	The Wii still has four to five years to go.
774177	777219	At this rate, they're going to be scraping the bottom of the barrel near the end of its life.
777760	783464	I know that Nintendo's got a significant amount of masterpieces still to release on Virtual Console, but are they going too fast?
783725	784405	Sincerely, Heon.
784525	784866	P.S.
785766	787588	I am now a Pastafarian thanks to the show.
788008	788689	FSM lives.
789509	790270	Flying Spaghetti Monster.
791610	791970	Wow.
793192	795474	I fear the day that Marissa has influence on anyone.
796054	797816	All hail his noodley goodness.
798056	798596	Love you, Marissa.
799237	801539	Anyhow, actually, I actually... She'll be up here in two weeks.
801559	805963	She's coming back a lot sooner than we thought, so that's going to be a very interesting program.
807444	810007	Anyhow, back to the content of the email.
811248	812088	What was the email about again?
812909	815351	About if Nintendo's releasing... whatever, Rob.
815411	818094	Virtual console games coming out too fast or whatever's going on.
818979	820040	Right now, no.
820320	824622	I mean, keep in mind what we were talking about earlier in the program, that there's this big drought going on with the games.
825222	836808	And although Reggie Fils-Aimé lied and said we wouldn't have these droughts this time around, keep in mind one thing he did say is that the virtual console releases, the big ones, would supplement the lack of Wii games during these slow periods.
837208	841610	So I think right now, no, they're not necessarily doing the virtual console games too fast.
841630	847033	I think this was probably a pretty decent time to release Ocarina and Kid Icarus and some of those really big titles people want.
847546	848527	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
875919	876780	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
897391	900953	and hopefully someday we'll start getting the multiplayer add-ons.
901033	904295	Maybe some of our games will be enabled for multiplayer slowly but surely.
904555	905915	Maybe we'll get our cheat codes.
906095	908377	I could see that as something that happens slowly but surely in 2008.
908417	910217	I want Icarus to fight Medusa Angels.
910938	912599	And I want my Justin Bailey in Metroid.
912699	914319	And hopefully originals too.
914720	915980	Don't we want some Wii originals?
916260	917621	Some more original Wii games?
918001	918461	Heck yeah.
918762	921603	So that would be hopefully where the console goes in 2008 and 2009.
922163	923144	So we will see what happens.
924464	925725	Next email is very special.
926713	929278	Dear OLR crew, my name is Ranma from Indonesia.
929859	931242	I'm a classic video game lover.
931362	936091	I believe that I am probably the first person from Indonesia becoming one of your loyal fans.
937674	938455	Now I have to know.
938495	939397	I'm going to check stats.
940034	943617	Right now I'm working as a journalist in most of my articles about technology and video games.
943637	946039	I'm also working as a local video game music composer.
946639	949281	One thing that will probably surprise you is that I am blind.
950022	952844	I was born with only 10% sight ability after being operated.
953764	955125	Now how can I operate a computer?
955366	959929	I'm using screen reader that enables me to read objects shown on my laptop so I can read and write.
961042	962062	and even download your show.
962603	966706	When I was a child, I was so interested in video games because it had attractive sounds and graphics.
967247	972631	I even owned an Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, NES, Genesis and SNES.
973111	975673	With only 10% sight, I could still enjoy classic games.
976234	981998	I could not recognize objects or details, but I could still understand, for instance, which one is my hero and which one is the enemy.
982379	986142	I even finished many famous classic games such as Super Mario series, Contra Gradius,
987298	994622	and many more, but when 3D gaming era came out, Playstation, Nintendo 64 and Saturn, I decided to give up because I could not play games with so many movements.
995682	999144	After that, I decided to enjoy video games in other fashions.
999664	1003806	I started to record or collect music from games I played.
1004446	1005947	I'll share you some of my listening later.
1006387	1008148	So now on to my comments about you guys.
1009469	1009809	Scroll down.
1011525	1013246	Well, I could not say a word but awesome.
1013266	1017727	Your podcast is the first experience enjoying video games news on an audio form.
1018187	1020908	I actually found your site last January and started to become your fan.
1021308	1022808	I even noticed some of your information.
1022828	1025429	I even quoted some of your information in my articles.
1026129	1031951	Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, you are the craziest gang I have ever loved.
1032851	1036812	I feel like having lots of friends video game folks that refreshes my energy and brain during the working hour.
1037272	1038933	You should know that not many Indonesians
1039688	1040548	Thank you for watching!
1057472	1057932	DarkSakura.com
1077142	1078882	It takes advantage of stereo sound systems.
1078982	1084584	For example, if you're playing a spaceship battle game and your enemy is on your left, you can hear their ship on your left speaker and can shoot them.
1084944	1087024	You can also chase them if they dodge your attack.
1087084	1089605	Let's say they move from left to right.
1089625	1090365	I'm going to scroll down.
1091906	1093246	Again, pay attention to the speaker.
1093766	1096827	They did something like that with that Atari controller that you use your forehead to play.
1098487	1101448	And Sega did a couple of audio-only games on the Saturn.
1102541	1103242	You can try them here.
1103302	1104503	It's at audiogames.net.
1105043	1107044	I wonder if it can be DarkSakura's side of the week.
1107545	1107905	We'll see.
1109266	1110687	Well, I think that's all I can share.
1110787	1113549	I hope I keep in touch with you guys.
1113589	1115210	This email can be read on air.
1115350	1121635	As for joining your show via Skype, I think it is difficult because the connection, like I've mentioned before, is very slow to make such a call.
1122135	1123056	Plus the time difference.
1124197	1131362	Lastly, I'm working on an Xbox 360 project along with a local game developer at max-studio.net to produce independent games.
1131980	1132400	DarkSakura.com
1155265	1156626	Wow, what an amazing email.
1156866	1158206	That was really cool.
1176499	1177660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1204269	1205310	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1230208	1242413	They were talking about how they had a group of blind people riding their bicycle down the road using clicking to determine location of cars and other things in the road.
1243114	1257280	And that their study group actually managed to avoid children running out in the road, avoided trash in the street, by using their sense of hearing
1258534	1262277	to determine space relation around them.
1262998	1272124	They say that if you lose one capability, your other capabilities become so much more sensitive, so that really makes sense, I think.
1273365	1278969	I'd be very curious what this listener has to think about the Wii, because he does have at least the 10% site.
1280943	1291947	The Wii is interesting because it has that rumble and the speaker that's actually in the Wiimote, as well as the rumble, depending on where your cursor is on screen, that could help you identify if you're pointing at a certain object.
1292207	1304911	I imagine not all games would work, but I'm kind of curious, could the Wii maybe be something that would help bring this guy back into gaming, where the 3D games and the ultra-intensive graphics have kind of made him unable to play?
1305352	1309553	I would have never known about this type of site and the way they make these games.
1310095	1311737	and I guess I'm just ignorant that way.
1311777	1313258	I would have never known had it not been for this email.
1313318	1314799	So thank you very much for the email.
1315040	1317462	I'm going to check that site out just because I want to know.
1317522	1319303	I want to see what kind of games there are.
1319423	1328491	There have been other games, and I don't think they were necessarily brought out for the blind in particular, but Sega, there were a number of Saturn games that focused only on audio.
1328992	1334857	There was one game that came with a packet of seeds where you had to use the audio to raise a plant.
1335679	1336140	Very interesting.
1336400	1342384	Alpha Canogram reminds us, and SSJ100 Matt chimes in too, about how Ellen actually gave a blind kid a Wii on her show.
1342444	1342804	Remember that?
1342824	1344225	That was some gaming news a while back.
1344905	1346326	That was before the Wiis were even out.
1346746	1350789	So kind of an interesting reminder there from the chat room.
1350809	1353010	That's why we love chat, because they remember things and we don't.
1353391	1355732	Well, this next email comes from BearWhoDriveCar.
1356452	1356933	I love that name.
1357353	1357853	That's so great.
1359715	1360355	French fries, sorry.
1361072	1362833	Okay, I have to stop for just a minute.
1362873	1364113	Loki, what the hell is it?
1364133	1365854	You have DDR5thMix on your PSP?
1366094	1366254	Yeah.
1366334	1367295	What are you hacking over there?
1369016	1371457	I was putting a PS1 image on here.
1371477	1374658	I didn't know it... God, I'm so far behind on my PlayStation.
1375679	1378840	Dang, you mean if I get a card you can do that with PlayStation 1 games for my PSP?
1378860	1389525	Yeah, you put a custom firmware on there and you can convert any PS1 image to play on a PSP given that you have the big enough... Now my next question for you is why the fuck do you have
1389735	1391196	and DDDR on your PSP.
1392297	1393198	So I can play with the controller.
1394418	1395499	That's how I play normally.
1395599	1396300	Back to the emails.
1396680	1396960	Sorry.
1397941	1398261	Anyway.
1399522	1401243	Yo, just writing to Vent about the Wii.
1401383	1403945	I do like it, but you guys mentioned that there are too many controllers.
1404025	1405226	Well, I can't agree more.
1405787	1406967	First, I got Super Mario Bros.
1406987	1407648	with the Wiimote.
1407928	1411191	It's kind of odd because of the shape and size, but that was okay.
1411511	1412551	Then I got Smash Bros.
1412592	1415834	Melee, and all of a sudden, to play multiplayer, I needed two GameCube controllers.
1416054	1417195	Okay, not too bad.
1417734	1429345	Then I bought Contra, and that's when I noticed if you try to play with the GameCube controller, I try to play with the GameCube controller, but if you recall the locations, the YB on SNES and Game Boy controllers are totally different.
1429385	1432768	By the way, I hate the GameCube controller and its asymmetrically sized buttons.
1433228	1435731	So now I have to buy a Wii Classic controller, two for multiplayer.
1436251	1438413	I've also purchased three Wiimotes and four Nunchucks.
1438473	1440735	So, Nintendo Wii, $250, three Wiimotes, $120, four Nunchucks, $80.
1443948	1447449	I get the point, but at the same time, you didn't have to buy the controllers.
1447509	1450049	You just didn't like the way it felt on the GameCube controllers.
1450089	1453770	And again, you're not forced to even buy Contra or any Super Nintendo game at all.
1453790	1454290	Whereas PlayStation 3...
1474212	1476873	You have to buy a Blu-ray drive, like it or not.
1499110	1499810	and so on and so on.
1526223	1528684	But if you want to get a wireless headset, that's more money.
1528784	1533407	And I say, yeah, you kind of do need that wireless headset if I want to play DDR or so on.
1533667	1538889	So anyhow, interesting point, but I think a slightly flawed one.
1540670	1541050	I don't know.
1541771	1548434	I think that there's something to it, but it all depends on how far you'll go for the sake of convenience.
1549915	1551456	Anyway, next email comes up.
1551536	1554257	Actually, could I just say some quick points from chat that came up here?
1555033	1555973	Let's see what's going on.
1556894	1558934	Heon wants to start a fight here.
1559194	1561435	You are not good enough for the GameCube controller, you noob.
1562015	1565256	And Blaze says, boo-fucking-hoo, do your research before you buy a system.
1565316	1566877	So a couple of people throwing some rocks there.
1567657	1572678	Sky Warrior, that's with a Y, not an I, says, value, what makes the Wii so compelling?
1572959	1575439	Too bad the PlayStation 3 has no value as of now.
1575879	1576520	Very interesting.
1577860	1580061	And some interesting comments there from the chat room there.
1580501	1584482	James Patrick says, a lot of Wii games only need one remote and you pass it around.
1585174	1586415	So, kind of interesting there.
1586595	1587215	Ooh, food.
1587676	1596642	And also they have games, they have games like coming out now like Wing Island and Kororimpa that use one remote and nunchuck for two players.
1596922	1599144	So, they've got all that stuff going on.
1601445	1602005	Jamie's got a mouth.
1602046	1604267	I don't want that now after you put your mouth all over it.
1604407	1605448	I only ate off one side of it.
1605468	1605808	It's fine.
1606769	1607629	It doesn't look that good anyway.
1607669	1609010	I'm starting South Beach tomorrow again.
1609371	1609731	Anyway.
1610551	1610791	Anyway.
1611672	1612373	Last email.
1612533	1613673	This email actually is not the last one.
1613693	1614354	It comes from Necky.
1617864	1644484	really the one thing that I wanted to go in here and it's a really long email and this is going to be one that I'm going to leave on the website but I wanted to mention this I like the idea of telling people now you've posted a site plug for you on my home forum dscommunity.co.uk to plug the site for them and xbox360fanatics link is z6.envisionfree.com slash 360 underscore fanatics slash index dot php
1645114	1650598	We are currently quite small, but invite everyone to join no matter where you are, and that includes you, Jamie, Loki, and Rob.
1651999	1662187	I wanted to do that, though, just because Neki writes us regularly, and I'm going to be posting this in the thing, but I thought that it would be nice for me to go ahead and give the little plug.
1662667	1671634	There's also another bit in here that says, I remember the first email of last from the taped segment was a loving rant about the last few episodes.
1671714	1673516	I, too, feel slightly likewise, but I agree.
1674412	1678635	with you, Jamie and Rob, that it does keep your show unique.
1678695	1682257	Inviting Casper the Gay and Rice Princess every week may not be such a good idea, though.
1683057	1687140	I do not hold anything against them, but having them on every week would alter many people's views of your show.
1688401	1690742	Well, that's why these folks are guests, not hosts.
1691142	1692623	They said it out of love, not hate.
1692883	1693183	Gotcha.
1693784	1695905	Anyway, that one's going to get reposted.
1699059	1700600	Sorry, I'm actually trying to do a search.
1700620	1701780	I want to see where this post comes up.
1701820	1702761	I'm looking at this site.
1702801	1704641	DScommunity.co.uk.
1705202	1706122	That's a whole little DS.
1706142	1707923	And I imagine there's lots of friend code training going on.
1707983	1708403	Oh, here it is.
1709003	1710764	There's actually a forum called Plug A Site.
1711924	1713365	And there's this post there.
1714265	1718247	Great site for podcasts and live shows focusing on video gaming.
1718687	1720328	Podcasts available on iTunes.
1720648	1722189	MP3 download available on actual website.
1722449	1724129	Covers release dates for most of the world.
1724189	1726030	Most are accurate as they have insider sources.
1726370	1728051	One of the guys works for a game distribution company.
1728407	1731189	Good fun to listen to, especially when you have nothing to do or on a commute.
1731689	1732029	I like that.
1732089	1733770	Orange Launch Radio, better than nothing.
1734110	1734370	Yeah.
1735771	1737012	No, thank you very much for the plug.
1737292	1738032	We appreciate that.
1738353	1741715	You are a true veteran of the OL Army, and we salute you.
1743255	1746838	We got an email from Gaming Nerd about... Nerd.
1748679	1749219	Hey, now.
1750460	1750740	Anyway...
1753746	1759811	Hey, OLR, I know this is kind of a risky subject to mention, but I feel it must be heard so that people understand what could be happening in the future in gaming.
1760431	1770519	After listening to Loki's rant in the last week's episode about there not being any good games for PS3 and 360, and only average ones, it got me looking back at the numerous anonymous sites that I've been to.
1771559	1778905	I'm finding it pretty easy to download pirated PS2 and Xbox games off the net and burning them to DVD-Rs and playing them on modded consoles.
1779850	1786332	Knowing how easy it is to download PS2 and Xbox games, it gets you wondering just how much money game companies are losing just from these two consoles.
1787332	1795354	With that loss in money, there's only so much money that can be spent to produce average titles with the kind of graphics power and development tools that are provided for the PS3 and 360.
1795654	1805356	It's no wonder that Wii is overtaking the competition with its console for the simple reason that GameCube ran games off any unique media that wasn't easily accessible to the public.
1806297	1807457	Thus, more money was earned
1808171	1809072	Thank you for watching!
1833860	1838243	It'll only be a matter of time before we see a Blu-ray burner and PS3 games get pirated.
1838703	1843766	A mod chip is released to the console, which will result in even more money lost to the companies that make their games for the PS3.
1844427	1852732	I'm even more surprised the Japanese market isn't complaining about piracy, but that you could only mean there's much more loyalty to gaming than some of us here in the States.
1853353	1858096	Especially when it comes to buying my PS2 imports, I'm more than willing to spend $64 to buy games like Puyo Puyo Fever 2
1858803	1874296	MeltyBlood, DDR Supernova, Beatmania2DX and supporting the companies that made these games and like most people that I've heard who just go ahead and download imports since they either can't find the store that sells them or don't want to spend an extra $14 off everyday $50 US titles that might have just come out.
1875637	1884164	Anyways, I hope this letter gives a better understanding as to why big names aren't really as big anymore as it partially is due to the loss of money and loss of quality for the games themselves.
1884935	1890419	I can remember when it was really big news for a game like Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo, and Final Fantasy to get new sequels.
1890900	1895864	But nowadays, it's just the same thing because there is enough money to do much else in the games.
1895984	1901789	Unique aspects are gone and there's not much else we can say about gaming other than stop the piracy and the magical return.
1901969	1903130	You're truly a gaming nerd.
1903710	1909255	It's not often you hear from people who are willing to defend the fact that video game piracy is a bad thing.
1910095	1911737	So, very interesting email.
1912437	1913458	Don't copy that floppy.
1914093	1921719	As a famous musician once said, Loki, I'm curious what your feedback is on this whole piracy is bad for the industry angle.
1922619	1932387	Sure, it's bad for the industry, but, you know, to be honest, nowadays, a lot of stuff, if it's not worth playing, I won't even go and pirate it or anything like that.
1932787	1935149	I'll just not play it, but, I mean...
1936383	1944585	I guess, I buy normally, I mean, I buy a lot of stuff that just comes out and I find out, you know, the hard way that a lot of the games do suck.
1945045	1951106	So I can see where a lot of people get burned by these games that, you know, get great reviews and they're like, what the fuck, this is crap.
1951846	1953027	Driver 3, for example.
1955187	1964809	Yeah, piracy is, especially if you make it so easy like it is on the PlayStation 2 or even the original PlayStation, yeah, it's going to be a huge issue, but
1966363	1966703	I don't know.
1967024	1967684	It's all morals.
1967864	1970246	If you think stealing's bad, then you're not going to do it.
1971187	1973769	Bandit says, bad for the industry, but good for Loki.
1974390	1974950	In our chatroom.
1978553	1982777	GS68 says, I buy legit copies, though I admit I've done my share of ROM downloading.
1983417	1986280	I think ROMs are not quite as bad.
1986560	1992625	In fact, they're really not as bad, because usually the things you're pirating ROMs of, I mean, if you're doing current DS games, that's one thing.
1992964	1993504	DDR5thMix Virtual Console
2016805	2024569	I have a ROM of Kid Icarus on my computer.
2025129	2027310	I don't like to play Kid Icarus on my computer.
2027650	2030131	I like to play it on my television like I did when I was a kid.
2030451	2034653	So for that, it was worth the $5 to me because I love Kid Icarus that much.
2035053	2039075	To be honest, I've got to play PS1 games on my PSP because what else am I going to play?
2039551	2040431	Grand Theft Auto?
2040551	2041312	I mean, seriously.
2041772	2043252	What else is out for the PSP?
2044833	2046713	A whole lot of stuff I'm not interested in.
2046913	2048734	It sounds like a lot of stuff coming soon, though.
2049854	2050214	Soon.
2050274	2051415	It's always coming soon.
2051435	2052115	Whatever, whatever.
2053556	2054876	Anyway, may I read the next email?
2055056	2055916	You sure may.
2056096	2056416	Thank you.
2056436	2057077	Last email.
2059237	2059838	Hiya, guys.
2059938	2064179	I just want to know what it is that we in Europe and Australia have done to piss off Sony.
2065619	2067380	Whatever it was, I'm sure we could apologize.
2068246	2069627	It's the funny accents.
2070547	2071268	No, shut up.
2073209	2075230	Maybe come to some kind of arrangement.
2075650	2077231	You don't get this kind of treatment in America.
2077271	2077711	How come?
2077791	2079692	Is it cash bribes, sexual favors?
2080712	2083474	I'm sure you know why it is I'm feeling hard done by.
2084975	2087356	I was accepting of the higher price tag.
2087536	2088316	We are used to that.
2088957	2092378	Also, the late release date, I've only just bought my copy of Final Fantasy XII.
2092398	2093859	We're used to having to wait.
2093879	2097161	Waiting longer to pay extra for an inferior piece of hardware is taking the biscuit.
2098015	2099776	Full backwards compatibility.
2099836	2100657	Well, there's another thing.
2100697	2101757	You call it a biscuit.
2101897	2102718	I mean, come on.
2103058	2103238	Rob!
2103258	2104259	My expression is take the cake.
2104299	2107080	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
2107100	2107380	Shut up.
2107560	2107821	What?
2108441	2109702	I'm just, obviously I'm kidding.
2109742	2110002	Come on.
2110042	2110582	Stuff it!
2111323	2111703	Thank you.
2113464	2115625	I'm going to flip Jamie off the British way.
2115665	2116085	There you go.
2116565	2117186	Up your arse.
2117626	2118887	Hey, two-finger salute for you.
2120668	2122209	You're being a real tit.
2123769	2124610	Don't be such a tit.
2130391	2130711	I'm done.
2131232	2131652	I promise.
2131913	2138018	To use a bit of proper colloquialism, Rob's doing my head in here.
2138859	2139700	So shall I continue?
2140360	2140861	I suppose.
2140881	2141741	Okay.
2142222	2142522	Wanker.
2144444	2147547	Full backwards compatibility was one of the biggest selling...
2148129	2151092	Points for the PS2 from me and would have been on the PS3.
2151473	2159561	Being able to play a session of San Andreas and putting on Bishi Bashi Special if mates come over without switching consoles or messing with wires is important to me.
2160310	2160710	Oh yes, this guy.
2160750	2160830	Yes.
2160850	2161170	Amazing work.
2189916	2191597	Bandit calls this whole thing bullocks.
2193378	2194699	That's what Bandit has to say about it.
2195639	2198221	You know, here's why... I offered you some.
2198241	2199101	Don't give me that look.
2199281	2199562	What?
2199822	2200822	You look at my cupcake.
2201243	2203824	It looks like a yummy cupcake, but I don't want it.
2204705	2205685	Cupcakes make me fat.
2205745	2206145	I don't want it.
2206185	2208687	You put your fingers all over that cupcake.
2208727	2210768	You haven't even, like, torn off the paper.
2211068	2212849	You've just dived into the cupcake.
2212989	2216651	I asked you if you wanted some, and you said no, so I started licking the ice.
2216691	2217592	Don't be such a twat.
2224273	2228714	I think the reason why Europe gets shit on is I think they sell the least amount of consoles there.
2228934	2229274	The end.
2229715	2229995	Right?
2230355	2230795	Am I right?
2232175	2232295	No.
2232375	2233255	Loki says I'm wrong.
2235516	2236596	I would think that's what it is.
2237436	2237857	I don't know.
2239537	2242858	Don't they sell more consoles in Japan and America than they do in Europe?
2245138	2245478	Maybe.
2245919	2247699	I guess it depends what you consider to be Europe.
2248288	2252031	Do you consider Europe to be everything on the other side of the Atlantic?
2252651	2256734	Or do you consider Europe to be, you know... I just think that they think that their U.S.
2256814	2259076	and Japan markets are more important than their U.K.
2259116	2263779	markets, and they want to make sure they have enough consoles for us because we're spending more money on games.
2265100	2271265	I always said the TVs, too, because the Japan and U.S.
2271465	2275388	share the same TV format standard, whereas NTSC... It doesn't matter with HD.
2276241	2280004	If Sony's really pushing the HD format, then having PAL or NTSC is not going to matter.
2280044	2288991	But, not everybody has an HD TV yet, so the systems have to work with the old TVs, whether they are this, you know, whoring up the HD signal or not.
2289011	2289972	That should be pretty easy to do, though.
2290332	2290792	I would think.
2290832	2291633	Just a thought.
2291673	2292754	I'm just processing a lot here.
2292774	2298018	They have to figure out what components they're going to take out of your PS3 so that they can lower the price on their end.
2298618	2299719	That's what they have to do.
2301881	2302321	Alright, well.
2303221	2303561	We don't know.
2303581	2304942	I mean, that's a Sony question.
2304962	2306822	We've given you our thoughts, though.
2306902	2314585	And regardless, it's not nice that they keep giving you the shaft over there on the different games.
2315485	2315745	Rob.
2316105	2316305	What?
2317886	2318366	I'm sorry, no.
2318426	2322988	Look, the international listeners ought to know I love them.
2323068	2324528	I tease because I love.
2324568	2326829	And as somebody in chats, I don't even know who said this here.
2328169	2330250	Who said my accents were so bad they were good?
2331561	2338624	Somebody there said my accents are so bad they're funny.
2339304	2344226	Uni says Sky's accents are like my mom trying to do a British accent and completely miserably failing at it.
2344606	2346026	Oh goody, now I'm like your mom.
2346106	2347547	That's a very nice compliment.
2349127	2349788	Like your mom.
2350828	2353149	Orange Lounge Radio, it's like your mom.
2354417	2355798	Go leave that on an iTunes review.
2356759	2361402	I want one of our British listeners to record that for us so that we can make a bumper out of it.
2361422	2362563	We need to bring back the bumpers.
2362883	2363444	I miss the bumper.
2363564	2363964	I know.
2364164	2364765	Orange Lingerie.
2364865	2365645	I was like your mom.
2366366	2367026	I could do that better.
2368688	2369348	I could do that better.
2369368	2369588	All right.
2369608	2369808	Sorry.
2369869	2370189	Forget it.
2370629	2371109	No, seriously.
2371129	2371370	I could.
2371550	2372130	Any more emails?
2372731	2373291	That was it, right?
2373471	2374952	Mailbag at OrangeLingerie.com.
2374992	2375473	Send us more.
2376974	2377774	Send emails.
2377895	2379296	My accent wants some fan mails.
2379356	2383739	We need to do one that says, you lose because we say so.
2385217	2413592	So... So anyways, apparently the rumor is much like the, you know, online libraries, they are also withholding the Mii libraries for the Nintendo Wii from third-party developers and not letting them develop games that will utilize the Miis, which is kind of disappointing because I would like to use my Miis in a lot more things than just, you know, Wii Sports or WarioWare, I guess.
2414193	2414553	But, um...
2414875	2415776	I don't see why they don't.
2415796	2417557	Don't use your me's in Grand Theft Auto.
2418278	2419979	Oh my god, that would be awesome.
2420019	2421280	That would be so cool.
2421981	2431129	Even stuff just like maybe your face or something on SSX Blur or something like that.
2431289	2431950	Or your mom.
2432590	2434812	You could literally put your mom in the game.
2436656	2437416	Something like that, yeah.
2437837	2439277	So, I don't know why they don't.
2439358	2445921	I think it's stupid, but if it's anything like the online stuff was, they want to make sure they get it right first before they put it out to everybody.
2446461	2448402	Which is a poor excuse if you ask me, but whatever.
2448903	2454266	So, I'm sure, like the online, it'll be something that's implemented later on.
2454466	2459428	So, you know, while it may not be happening now, it will happen later.
2459548	2461950	Yeah, the third parties will get their me's soon enough.
2462730	2464231	Although I agree, they should have had it from the start.
2465372	2465872	Well, um...
2466443	2475807	GameTap, we mentioned in Part A when I was talking about Myst Online, and what should be noted is that GameTap is also now starting to really get behind the independent game movement.
2476207	2478388	Seems like a really good fit for GameTap, if you ask me.
2479248	2489152	Well, GameTap has announced they're going to be doing a new indie game label, and what they're going to do, they're going to sign and distribute any worthy indie project over the GameTap service.
2489572	2492994	And this would be a really great way to get your game out there, because GameTap has their user base.
2493014	2495935	They won't say how big it is, which makes me think it's not that big.
2496916	2497116	GameTap.com
2526004	2526745	So that's kind of cool.
2527926	2530649	So, Loki, is this something that might get you on GameTap finally?
2530829	2530989	Nope.
2531509	2534913	I don't have time to be paying for online monthly subscriptions for games.
2535153	2536374	I thought I'd ask anyway.
2537896	2539978	Well, excuse me.
2540498	2541919	I'm sorry, I was just choking up a baby.
2541939	2544922	Okay.
2546063	2548065	Apparently this show has that effect on people.
2549887	2550267	Sorry.
2550307	2550568	Sorry.
2551286	2557588	I just coughed up a baby listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2557708	2563189	They were talking about babies flying out of vaginas in one part, and in the second part, they coughed up a baby.
2563909	2564549	It's amazing.
2565630	2572671	Anyway, there is some love coming out thanks to SNK.
2572951	2578453	Art of Fighting actually is going to be having a collection to be released stateside.
2581246	2594411	Art of Fighting was a very interesting game because it was a big, definite knockoff in some respects of Street Fighter II, what with, you know, Rio and Robert Garcia and all of them.
2594551	2598252	Of course, the two of them also gave us Dan and later ones, too.
2599032	2600093	But I don't know.
2600593	2601213	It's kind of cool.
2601533	2604074	I always liked Art of Fighting because they did name a fighter after me.
2604394	2605995	Having a Rob in a fighting game was pretty cool.
2606915	2609476	I also like that old school zoom in and out effect it did.
2609983	2612024	Art of Fighting, though, gave us King.
2612324	2612804	That's right.
2613244	2614124	And King was awesome.
2614605	2615645	Big ol' lesbian.
2616185	2616605	And Yuri.
2617005	2617225	Mm-hmm.
2617485	2618526	With the flying butt attack.
2620967	2623107	Gotta love flying butt attacks.
2623927	2627409	In fact, I'm gonna do a flying butt attack on DarkSakura right now.
2627469	2628389	Get your ass off me!
2630000	2632181	I've been rubbed with gay ass.
2632541	2642523	Anyways, if you like ridiculous weapons much like Rob's flying butt attack, then you're definitely going to love Worms HD, which is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2642543	2643784	Speaking of ass worms.
2643824	2646865	Finally, this Wednesday.
2647005	2648865	So that is awesome.
2648925	2652406	It's supposed to be 800 Microsoft points or $10 in real money.
2653366	2655127	And it's awesome.
2655267	2655747	It's Worms.
2655947	2656567	It's 2D.
2657167	2659528	And, yeah, I can't wait to play it.
2660174	2661375	Oh lord, bless this thy hand grenade
2674366	2675086	Sam & Max GameTap
2696624	2700466	Now, Telltale Games finally said something this week about the whole thing.
2700906	2705628	They said they will, quote, look closely at releasing a potential Sam & Max project.
2705708	2713572	Quote, we can confirm that we are hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, although we do not have any official Xbox project announcements to share right now.
2714173	2718034	Well, I would think if they're hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, they've got something planned.
2718455	2719015	And what else?
2719534	2720454	DarkSakura's Website of the Week
2757369	2760913	My website of the week is a marvelously special one.
2761533	2765056	It is marvel.com, which I've been spending a whole shitload of time on.
2765937	2768960	Downloading, actually mostly just downloading wallpaper.
2769460	2778188	But they have, I think it's cool, they actually have some of the, I'd say comics from like a few months ago uploaded so that you can read them.
2778228	2780210	They have links to the toys, the movie news.
2780745	2785986	There's blogs up there, podcasts, stuff for mobile.
2786086	2787127	It's actually pretty cool.
2787167	2789267	I've been pretty happy with it.
2790007	2792428	So I'd say check it out.
2792528	2793168	It's really fun.
2795769	2796689	For a commercial site.
2798749	2799129	Alright.
2801270	2801970	What, are you surprised?
2802030	2803250	No, I'm just reading chat.
2803290	2805671	I'm arguing with Black Wolf right now in chat.
2806320	2807120	Hey, Rob, do your job.
2807281	2817445	Loki's friend is fighting me in chat right now, Loki's one friend, saying that it's going to be hard to fit Sam and Max on Xbox Live Arcade because of the size limit.
2817686	2820607	And I said, well, they upped the size limit to 250 megabytes, remember?
2821087	2823388	And BlackWolf says, yes, they'd have to make it more, though.
2824289	2828491	And BlackWolf says, I just don't want 360 people to get my Sam and Max hard game tab.
2829851	2830652	Ah, so that's sort of true.
2830852	2834254	You don't want people to have your Loki, and you don't want people to have your Sam and Max.
2834274	2834974	You are a very
2835680	2838041	Possessive individual, Mr. Bobby Blackwolf
2864048	2871131	So apparently they've spotted a couple games on the Vice, or I see VC and I think Vice City.
2871451	2879394	Virtual console servers, because I know you can still do that little hack with the web browsers to view what's on those.
2879714	2887497	But anyways, two games that have been spotted, one of them being Elevator Action, which is pretty awesome, and then Tecmo Bowl.
2888726	2889246	No, it's not.
2889426	2890487	Elevator Action sucks.
2890587	2891967	It's one of those games people remember.
2892247	2892988	No, Tecmo Bowl.
2893128	2894048	Oh, Tecmo Bowl's awesome.
2894688	2895889	Yeah, fuck Elevator Action.
2895969	2899990	Tecmo Bowl on the NES was awesome, but Tecmo Bowl on the arcade was not so awesome.
2900590	2908213	Because I have the Tecmo Bowl arcade game on some Tecmo collection I have on the Xbox randomly, but Tecmo Bowl on NES was pretty rad.
2909573	2910574	So I'm looking forward to seeing that.
2910614	2911414	That would be pretty cool.
2911874	2913214	Elevator Action, not so much.
2913295	2914635	Elevator Action was not that good.
2916052	2917053	Rob the Robot Rob the Robot
2946528	2948109	How about Rob Roberts, the bot?
2948449	2948889	That'd be good.
2949009	2949510	No.
2950570	2954132	They need to bring back... How about a Jamie bot where it just nags you to do things?
2955212	2956553	That would be a woman bot, okay?
2956973	2958154	Turn on your system!
2958934	2960215	Download this upgrade!
2961756	2962236	No!
2962396	2966078	I only called you once today to ask you to turn on your aim so I could send you the fucking pre-show.
2967399	2968539	Do not be a bitch to me, Rob.
2968559	2969720	Turn on your AOL.
2970400	2976223	If you think that I'm going to download your updates for you, you're completely wrong.
2977432	2978452	I'm an independent woman.
2978492	2979433	I'll do what I want.
2981254	2983194	I'm setting up in the middle of your game now.
2987916	2988676	I love this show.
2988756	2989837	I really, really love this show.
2990417	2990697	All right.
2990917	2993958	My battle aura has... All your memes have been deleted.
2993978	2998000	I have a power level of over 4,000 now, Rob.
2999040	2999801	I love you, Jamie.
3000441	3001981	The hell you do!
3002001	3003082	And JamieBot, and JamieBot.
3003122	3003922	The hell you do.
3003982	3005023	You treat me like this.
3005463	3006163	Look, here, look.
3006992	3011657	Jamie, I got a story that'll make you happy because I know you love Zork and Leisure Suit Larry.
3011957	3012718	Who doesn't love Leisure Suit Larry?
3012978	3013819	And King's Quest?
3014480	3017243	Actually, I never really played any of them except for the first Zork.
3017583	3018604	Can't you just play along?
3019905	3020206	Vodka.
3021047	3021367	Vodka.
3023516	3024496	I don't think Vodka was a game.
3024536	3026457	Okay, well how about the Indiana Jones?
3026617	3028078	Vodka cures PMS!
3028118	3028818	Maniac Mansion?
3029038	3030399	Yeah, I love Maniac Mansion.
3030419	3030879	There we go.
3030899	3034080	Well, Maniac Mansion, I'm sure there'll be a mention of it at AdventureCon.
3034400	3035260	But news alert!
3035761	3044904	AdventureCon is an adventure game convention that's going to happen August 28th and 29th at the Mirage Hotel right on the Vegas Strip.
3045224	3048185	It's going to be two days of adventure game nerdom.
3048865	3050506	There's actually going to be a Zork room.
3050919	3079394	Because basically AdventureCon had started out as a 30th birthday celebration for Zork And so they decided to, it kind of grew into this all-encompassing adventure game thing Kind of like how Orange Lingerie started about music games, but now we're all video games because we did that So, there you go That's kind of neat And this, by the way, this is the first AdventureCon So it started off being a Zork thing, now it's this whole big thing because they're actually going to have Al Lowe from Sierra there
3080175	3082636	Jane Jensen, the creator of the Gabriel Knights games.
3083017	3083537	It's pretty rad.
3083997	3085818	I did not realize that Zork 1 was written in 1977.
3086598	3092942	The White House with a mailbox here seems so, so long ago.
3094602	3095063	Hey, Rob.
3095083	3095623	What?
3095643	3097044	I just unleashed a grew in your underwear.
3097684	3098184	Thank you.
3099645	3101266	It's squishy.
3103407	3107509	Anyway, moving on for some different news.
3109028	3113890	The games for Windows Live Beta sign-up is now open.
3114850	3123252	It's the Microsoft PC version of Xbox Live, and the two are going to be tied together for cross-platform play.
3123833	3131555	So go check it out if you are not blessed enough to console game with the rest of us cool kids.
3134656	3134816	And...
3136772	3139073	Yeah, I will not be checking this out because I do not have Vista.
3140393	3141473	I do not want Vista.
3142014	3143094	Nor do I want to play PC.
3143134	3143994	Do not want!
3145615	3152097	But, what's kind of cool though, everyone remembers Wii Kade, that Flash... Wait, I have to say this real fast.
3152117	3153637	You know why I don't want Windows Vista?
3154417	3160579	Because I do not want my computer to look like those god-awful Heroes previews that were brought to us by Windows Vista.
3160859	3163720	That turned me off to Windows Vista.
3163780	3165141	I was like, what have you done to my Heroes?
3165781	3166481	Do not want!
3168897	3170198	and SimulatedVista.
3170259	3172080	Your offering has not pleased Kitty!
3174623	3175303	More!
3176845	3177586	No more!
3179407	3180108	Do not want!
3181369	3185133	So WeCade, a flashlight that has games made for the Wii browser.
3186100	3196349	Well, they've just opened up a downloadable API that will allow developers of other Flash games to use the Wii Remote's buttons for actual gameplay.
3196389	3202554	Before, it used to be limited to kind of mouse games that use only the A button for clicking and stuff like that.
3203055	3208619	But now they've actually figured out how to use every single button on the Wii Remote, which is pretty fucking awesome.
3208719	3211862	So hopefully we'll see some pretty cool games come from this.
3212583	3216664	and hopefully I will actually work on OLRWee.com at some point.
3216724	3227487	You had to do that because there was some website I saw that had all these popular Wii game things listed or something and I did not see OLRWee.com and I remembered, oh yeah, there's nothing on it.
3228407	3229027	Sorry.
3230187	3230928	Crackdown.
3231328	3232328	It's been a problem.
3232508	3237629	By the way, going back to the last story, it was commented in our chat room, Loki does not have friends on Vista.
3238410	3240070	Where's Black Wolf now, Loki?
3241192	3244133	BlackWolf even made that comment, so you got no friends now.
3244554	3245434	I don't have Vista.
3246755	3247375	Oh, no.
3247395	3248695	It's a joke.
3248895	3249956	Well, here's the thing, though.
3250476	3263362	Windows Live, you remember, is part of the Live Anywhere, so technically I have a lot more friends on Games for Windows Live than I do for actual the PS3 network.
3263442	3267904	So, ha, I do have friends on there, and I don't even have it.
3271502	3274703	Something that you can't play with friends, although I think it would be fun if you could.
3275203	3276563	It's a SimCity DS.
3276723	3279183	Actually, I don't know much about this.
3279243	3280724	Perhaps maybe you can play with friends.
3280984	3282864	Oh, there is wireless data exchange in this game.
3282884	3283504	I stand corrected.
3283524	3284284	So you can play with friends.
3284604	3285585	SimCity DS.
3286365	3290585	It has officially been announced that it will be coming to the U.S.
3290885	3291486	Yay!
3292186	3294066	Other things that SimCity DS allows you to do.
3294346	3297447	You can blow out fires by blowing on the DS's microphone.
3297507	3299547	Doesn't that actually keep fires going?
3299567	3300207	Ah, forget it.
3300911	3303613	You sign off proclamations using the stylus.
3304333	3304814	That's fun.
3306535	3307215	So there you have it.
3307996	3309757	That will be coming out in June, by the way.
3309797	3314700	So that's a nice little translation time between Japan and the U.S.
3314760	3314960	there.
3315481	3318202	Because I believe this game just came out in Japan like last week.
3318282	3324467	But I have to admit I'm not as excited about this game because it's based off the SimCity 2000 engine.
3325607	3327388	And I didn't like SimCity when it went 3D.
3327909	3329690	It was too much for my feeble brain to handle.
3331397	3333438	Bring me my old school 2D, SimCity.
3333538	3340183	I actually have it on virtual console and I never play it because yeah, I get sucked into other games like World of Warcraft.
3342304	3344946	Well, you know, that's just because you're an addict, Rob.
3346827	3348288	How about a different game?
3348408	3349349	How about Darwinia?
3350470	3356214	Darwinia, as announced by Introversion, is going to be multiplayer in 2008.
3356534	3358135	Excuse me.
3359116	3359436	It's a
3359915	3363917	Set for release on its own, it's called Multiwinia.
3364618	3369360	We'll let you play cooperatively or competitively.
3369740	3381227	The number of people on, they're not really sure how much they're going to be able to handle, but they're hoping that they're going to go really, really massive.
3384148	3389291	I'm going to, you know, reserve judgment for actually seeing it, you know.
3390631	3402079	They're saying that there's a quote by John Nottenbelt saying that it will let you organize your Darwinians into ranks and create massive armies.
3402619	3403560	So that would be kind of cool.
3403880	3404260	I don't know.
3404340	3407382	I'm still going to reserve judgment for actually seeing it.
3407622	3408523	Is that a free game?
3408563	3409183	I can't remember.
3409283	3410304	Was Darwinia a free one?
3410604	3412345	I believe it was.
3413526	3418569	Somebody in chat I'm sure knows because I believe some folks ought to know what's going on there.
3419270	3419570	But, um,
3421118	3423319	Let me see if anybody in chat can answer my question there.
3424179	3425199	Oh, they say no it wasn't.
3426420	3428480	I think you could download a demo for free is what it was.
3429701	3432302	Hitstun says Darwinia had a demo but the game was $20.
3432382	3435203	Because I was going to see if it was something I wanted to check out.
3435403	3437023	I'll check out the demo because I'm kind of curious.
3438564	3446587	By the way, I'm very proud of Miklatov because he's been unlocking achievements in Crackdown for me while this show's been going on.
3447047	3450708	So he got me this First Blood achievement which I didn't have and Bare Knuckle Brawler
3451294	3453375	Kill 150 gang members with your bare hands.
3453475	3453775	Nice.
3455415	3460077	So if you wondered how I was on Xbox Live during the show, it's actually Miklatov playing Crackdown right now.
3460957	3461237	Awesome.
3462617	3464558	But I have more achievements than you do at Crackdown.
3465638	3465939	Alrighty.
3466739	3468539	Yeah, you have a shitload of achievements in Crackdown.
3468559	3468819	That's great.
3468839	3470160	Well, I have more achievements than you do in Universe.
3470560	3473521	Oh, God, I can't believe I didn't mention this at the top of the show.
3474121	3474581	That's all right.
3474661	3475722	Nobody gets to the end of the show.
3476022	3480063	Do you know who I got a message from on Xbox Live while I was playing DDR Universe?
3480263	3480403	No.
3480951	3482172	Strip Club DJ.
3482652	3483913	Do you know who that person is?
3484353	3490476	He is like the guy who was like, for a long time, he was the number one gamer points holder on all of Xbox Live, right?
3491236	3492857	He has over 100,000 gamer score.
3493137	3498259	I got a message from him, and it said simply, can you use the joystick on DDR?
3499340	3503362	Because I think he's probably contemplating, do I want to get DDR to get the 1,000 achievement points out of?
3503772	3504432	So I replied.
3504733	3506114	I replied with a voice message, though.
3506894	3514439	But I said something like, yes, you can, but obviously you're supposed to use the dance pad, but if you're just trying to run through the game, you'll probably just want to use the controller.
3515780	3519302	But I said something about quest mode sucking and a lot of the unlocks coming through that.
3519642	3526367	Yeah, see, I was stupid, and I told somebody there was like 75 unlocks, because in quest mode it says 0 of 75 for music stuff.
3526527	3530369	That's how much you own, or how many songs you own in quest mode, right?
3530910	3531370	That's what it is.
3531923	3538285	When you buy a song in quest mode to have the advantage in quest mode, that's... See, the game doesn't fucking explain any of this.
3538305	3538965	That's why quest mode sucks.
3538985	3540305	I didn't even know what the hell that meant.
3540625	3541226	That's what it means.
3542866	3543406	So, there you go.
3547007	3559931	But that was kind of funny to get a message from him, because I guess, apparently, at one point, and I looked at my gamercard.net right after that, because that's the one that ranks... I was apparently, like, number six or seven in the world for gamer score earned in DDR Universe.
3560091	3560371	Really?
3560771	3561031	Yeah.
3561610	3563411	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3591700	3593080	But nobody has all 1,000 yet.
3594181	3595761	I only have 480 points in the game.
3595781	3596721	It's not that hard.
3596861	3603503	I mean, I could probably, if I really just sat down and played it, I could probably crank out the whole game in one day.
3603663	3612185	I mean, not that I'm not, you know, I may think achievement points are fun and all, and, you know, they kind of add something to the game, but I would not consider myself an achievement point whore, so to speak.
3613166	3618787	So it was kind of just interesting that I was, I did show up on there and got contacted by Strip Club DJ.
3618807	3619007	Okay.
3619540	3621301	True Achievement Points Horror because of it.
3621462	3622582	So, interesting.
3623803	3625865	Anyhow, we're going to open up the Skype line.
3625925	3628967	If you want to give us a call and interact with our program, you can do so.
3629347	3634371	The number is 1-877-GAME-OLR or you can always use Skype to give us a call.
3634972	3637213	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
3637253	3643378	If you want more information on that, you can visit www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
3644131	3646672	and we'll wait for some calls to start coming in.
3647093	3649454	While we wait for someone to come in, does anybody have a last minute story?
3650174	3650354	Yep.
3650694	3651335	What do you want, Jamie?
3652115	3654156	Well, Loki had one first, right?
3654176	3654757	Just real quick.
3654797	3656878	Just one story for now and then we'll get to some other calls.
3656898	3657538	Just real quick.
3657878	3666182	In God of War 2, someone had gotten the game out before it's come out and on the back of the manual there it says God of War PSP coming 2007.
3666623	3669224	So, confirm it is coming on the PSP.
3669244	3671205	Alright, there you have it.
3671265	3672266	Now we can go to the phones.
3672786	3672906	Um,
3673752	3677134	Legend of Zaku You already know about that gold is going to be released tomorrow for the location test, right?
3677594	3679855	Yeah, we mentioned that on last week's show.
3679875	3679955	Why?
3699682	3710065	No, I mean, they're all saying that, you know, from what I'm hearing right now, is that, you know, it has to do really good in order for it to actually move any further.
3710825	3713025	It's like a one-shot deal at the moment right now.
3713725	3714926	Well, but wait a minute, though.
3714966	3723148	I mean, what about those arcades that import Japanese games anyway, like Arcade Infinity and whatever that one is on the East Coast that was...
3729156	3732879	So this is the one that might tip the scale.
3733259	3734940	Well, what city is it in again?
3735000	3736041	It's somewhere in Illinois, right?
3736501	3737062	Naperville.
3737662	3738183	Naperville?
3738843	3739183	Yeah.
3739243	3739704	In Illinois?
3739724	3744047	Yeah, it's near Benson's location, nearby Chicago.
3744347	3753053	All right, well, if you are in the Chicago, Naperville area, and you are a music video game fan, and you want to see Beatmania make a U.S.
3753073	3754795	debut in arcades, you've got to go.
3754815	3755415	You've got to help out.
3756462	3758404	If you want to see it out, go through.
3758424	3759204	I'm through on it.
3759685	3759965	All right.
3760285	3762287	Well, thank you for the reminder, Mr. Zaku.
3762407	3763588	I unfortunately cannot attend.
3763628	3764609	Chicago's a little far.
3765129	3765890	Several thousand miles.
3766891	3769953	I know there's probably no one who's hearing this right now.
3769973	3770454	That's very true.
3770874	3773496	We do have the luxury of being not too far from L.A.
3774137	3777760	where we can drive for six hours to play 2DX Gold whenever they get it.
3778360	3779661	If they don't already have it, I don't even know.
3779902	3781723	I haven't actually followed B-Mania in a while, sadly.
3782684	3782984	Right.
3783124	3783385	All right.
3783925	3784846	Well, anything else, Zaku?
3786008	3798035	Um, just Sony's rumbling about why they just, why they didn't bother to settle quickly with immersion rather than just wait till they drop the PS3.
3798255	3798836	Pride.
3800217	3805460	Pride is more like they were banking on some, you know, on a sinking ship called their lawsuit.
3805700	3808862	Well, remember that Rumble is so last gen.
3809422	3812824	Well, that's, they're spinning it in, they're in denial.
3813336	3820298	It's like a little kid, they know they fucked up, and so they're just like, they don't want to admit it.
3820538	3822098	They don't want to admit they fucked up badly.
3822679	3826940	And that's why, you know, PS3 is not even worth getting right now, not even for another year.
3827560	3827860	Alright.
3828600	3834582	Well, Zaku, thank you very much for the call, and good luck with your 2DX Gold promotion.
3835582	3836383	Alright, thank you.
3837483	3839203	Alright, let's go to another phone call.
3839804	3841404	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3842537	3843117	Hey, what's up, guys?
3843157	3846419	It's the Rob D. Hi, Rob D. Are you still bitter about your loss from last week?
3847599	3848320	Eh, not so much.
3848480	3849720	All right, I'm just giving you a hard time.
3849740	3850601	Loki did a good job on that.
3850621	3851921	You were a very good sport about the whole thing.
3851941	3852582	What's on your mind, buddy?
3853482	3853902	Not too much.
3853922	3859345	Just wondering what you guys thought about the news about the 20 gigabyte PS3 being possibly discontinued.
3860094	3860975	I don't know if you heard about that.
3861595	3865218	We actually did cover it in part A. I don't know if Bobby's show ran long tonight or what.
3865939	3866479	I suck then.
3866639	3866979	It's okay.
3867780	3870462	I've actually been busy recording some stuff, but that's a different story altogether.
3870542	3871543	That's alright, we'll forgive you.
3872083	3882452	You know, I don't... The 20 gig model, I mean, it was not something I was interested in anyway, so I'm a little bit, you know, kind of about the whole thing anyway.
3882492	3888256	I think, to be honest, the 20 gig model is just as good as the 60 gig as far as what's available for it.
3888316	3889297	I mean, if I were the
3889964	3890544	Buy one.
3890764	3892505	I would pick the 20 gig.
3892705	3894785	I have a 20 gig, and it's great.
3895105	3899246	I mean, it's not like I have to worry about filling up with downloads because there's nothing to download on it.
3900507	3903387	Well, isn't the 60 gigabyte version supposed to have dual HDMI ports?
3903767	3904107	Oh, wait.
3904428	3904988	No, it doesn't.
3905088	3906448	No, I'm kidding.
3906528	3908048	That's what they said on E3.
3910789	3911409	But, yeah.
3911809	3915070	Other than that, that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about.
3915690	3916010	All right.
3916070	3918771	Well, thank you very much for the call, Rob D. We appreciate it.
3919910	3920870	Thank you for taking my call.
3920890	3921550	See you guys later.
3921610	3922091	No problem.
3922131	3922631	Have a good week.
3923171	3923331	Bye.
3923351	3923711	All right.
3923751	3923911	Bye.
3924651	3924891	All right.
3924951	3932753	If you want to give a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you got to call.
3932773	3933713	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3934193	3937334	DarkSakura, why don't you throw us your last minute story while we're waiting for a call?
3937454	3943155	Well, it was actually something posted by TigerClaw in the chat room during the break.
3943895	3948216	Activision released a screenshot from the new Transformers game that they're putting out.
3949339	3953160	Um, yeah, it makes my heart break.
3953360	3955100	I'm not gonna like the movie, I don't think.
3955180	3956441	It doesn't look like Transformers.
3957341	3961182	And the game makes my heart hurt.
3962722	3963663	What's so bad about it?
3964403	3965783	What isn't so bad about it?
3965963	3967143	Oh my god, did you see it?
3968324	3968384	No.
3968404	3969104	What did it look like?
3969864	3971544	It's fucking awesome is what it is.
3971884	3972765	The fuck it is?
3972985	3974345	That does not look like Bumblebee.
3974365	3978026	It looks like a bee's head and, like, junk.
3979454	3980375	I can't wait to see this movie.
3980395	3981236	It's going to be awesome.
3981436	3981716	I know.
3981816	3982397	It's awesome.
3983057	3985440	I mean, I'll go see it because I have to, but God!
3985460	3986741	Fucking ugly.
3990244	3990545	All right.
3990705	3994348	Well, let's go to another call here on the Skype line and see what you folks have to say.
3994909	3996030	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3996050	3996410	Who's this?
3997371	3997691	Whoa.
3997972	3998592	You guys can hear me?
3999053	4000074	Hi, yes, we can hear you.
4000094	4000394	What's up?
4001075	4002416	Hey, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
4003217	4004137	Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.
4004157	4004658	What's on your mind?
4005698	4006318	Oh, not that much.
4007018	4008519	I got a Wii for Valentine's Day.
4010940	4011660	Oh, Wii-ly!
4012520	4013300	Yes, Wii-ly!
4013600	4015601	It's a nice little present, too, I figured.
4017202	4017802	What did you think?
4019022	4021383	Oh, me and a girlfriend love it a lot.
4021923	4028525	We play mostly Wii Sports, Wii Play, and we're also getting into Metal Slug Anthology.
4031846	4035007	My big thing was that, did somebody in the show...
4035997	4038179	I said the Metal Slug Anthology stunk.
4038839	4039300	The what?
4039700	4040220	No.
4040240	4042962	It's awesome.
4043062	4044824	I haven't played Metal Gear Anthology.
4044944	4047826	I think, I'm sorry, Metal Slug Anthology.
4048146	4051729	I think what we said on the show is that Kropotkin and Hendrix reviewed it this week.
4051829	4056672	We were teasing the all games thing because they play Kropotkin and Hendrix between our show.
4057553	4059735	But I don't know if they said it sucked.
4059815	4061916	I unfortunately did not get a chance to hear their show yet this week.
4062697	4063537	I don't think they did though.
4063557	4064218	I think they liked it.
4065123	4075548	Yeah, it's pretty much better than the other emulations that came out for the other systems because in most of the emulated versions, like the Xbox for example, there were loading times in between each level.
4076248	4077269	This one has none.
4077649	4080310	It just pretty much comes into the game and plays it straight through.
4081550	4083671	So it's exactly like the arcade.
4085292	4086713	Interesting.
4088474	4089794	What else on the Wii have you been playing?
4089834	4091235	So obviously Metal Slug Anthology.
4092095	4093796	I tried the Wii Sports and the Wii Play.
4095858	4098099	We play, it's alright.
4098900	4100461	It was just waiting for the other controller, you know.
4101401	4101781	Gotcha.
4102382	4104823	Yeah, but the Wii Sports is a blast.
4106344	4109886	What do you think the Wii's chances are against the 360 and the PlayStation 3?
4110206	4112767	Now, you live, where was it that you live again?
4114148	4116049	New York, right nearby where Ranma lives.
4116189	4117610	Oh, okay.
4117710	4119571	What do you think, I thought for some reason you were in another country.
4120311	4124334	What do you think the chances are of the Wii doing against the 360 and the PS3 in the long run?
4126797	4138646	If they can get better games that just don't rely on the Wii controls, but rather make something like the original stuff and a good third-party support, yeah, it's definitely going to be a lamp for a while.
4138666	4139787	All right.
4140388	4142489	And not just thought of as a party system, you know?
4143190	4143370	All right.
4143450	4144971	Anything else you want to share with our listeners, my friend?
4145632	4146192	One question.
4146532	4146732	Yes.
4147373	4151276	What was the exact difference with Zelda on the GameCube and the Wii?
4153245	4157226	Everything is right-handed on the Wii and left-handed on the GameCube.
4158707	4161608	So they have the same graphics and music and all that?
4162408	4162888	Actually, no.
4162928	4164569	The GameCube does not support the 16x9.
4164609	4170270	Everything will be in the square as well, and that's why the graphics suffer a little bit.
4172051	4172651	Oh, okay.
4172891	4173871	So there you go.
4173891	4174932	All right.
4175472	4175712	All right.
4175732	4177932	Well, thank you so much for the call, buddy, and enjoy the Wii.
4178633	4178913	Thanks.
4178933	4179373	See you guys.
4179473	4179613	Later.
4179633	4179753	Later.
4180623	4182825	All right, we'll try at least one more call here on the Skype line.
4183265	4184346	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4184366	4184726	Who's this?
4187007	4187948	It's deep breathing.
4188648	4189489	Sorry, it's me.
4189509	4190690	It's Uni.
4190930	4192471	I thought it was an erotic phone call.
4192511	4192951	Who's this?
4193532	4194252	This is Uni.
4194412	4194892	Hi, Uni.
4194912	4196534	What's on your mind, buddy?
4196914	4198535	I was wondering about something.
4199075	4203038	You know, I was thinking about getting a PS3, but you know how crappy they are?
4204098	4205059	Yeah, yeah.
4205439	4207741	Well, what might be swaying your mind on this?
4208388	4214191	Well, I do play a lot of PS2 games on my PS2 and everything.
4214992	4221956	It's just, I don't know why I would want to buy one other than it enhances the graphics on your PS2 games.
4223077	4227519	And even for a while it was de-hancing them, if you might remember that thing a while back.
4228960	4232082	It's like, why should you buy one?
4232102	4233983	Because they're like a 300 or 400, maybe 500 piece of crap, really.
4238802	4244084	I'm just thinking about what I should buy because I'm not really sure yet.
4246685	4248586	I don't think the PlayStation 3 is worth it at the time.
4248646	4253648	Again, you've got to remember the golden rule of gaming here at Orange Lingerie.
4253768	4256789	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
4257549	4260090	So it's really about what type of games you want to play.
4260652	4266475	I mean, if first-person shooters are your thing, oh my god, Xbox 360 all the way.
4266795	4274379	If you want something that's a little more light-hearted, fun type of games, the Wii is very your active system type of game.
4274899	4277941	And then, of course, you've got the PlayStation 3, which doesn't have a lot right now.
4278001	4282783	It's thought that a little later on down the line, its strengths will be role-playing games and so on, just like it was on PlayStation 2.
4283223	4285204	But right now, not a lot going for it.
4285805	4289647	And you've got Microsoft trying to step it up with what they were lacking with the Xbox the first time around.
4290067	4290227	So...
4290765	4296850	They're talking about bringing out another MMO from Square Enix called Final Fantasy XIII.
4296950	4298331	I'm not really sure about it.
4299272	4307718	I mean, it might bring me back to Square Enix, but they're really sitting on their thumbs most of the time when you're calling a GM on Final Fantasy XI.
4308599	4313543	I've been playing WoW, and when you call a GM, it's like that.
4313843	4314624	You know, you
4315046	4315947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4334406	4336928	Final Fantasy XIII Versus is not going to be online.
4336968	4339030	I think it's going to be more of a Kingdom Hearts-ish game.
4339311	4340492	But that sounds pretty hot to me.
4342393	4345476	Final Fantasy XIII probably will be the game that gets me on PlayStation.
4346517	4350581	I also heard that Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories is coming to the PS2.
4353453	4354433	I saw the trailer for it.
4354473	4356254	There's a big trailer for it on YouTube.
4357174	4361615	It's completely redone, full style for the Kingdom Hearts games.
4361755	4364495	It's really, really awesome looking.
4366135	4369756	If I can remember where to find it, I should see if I can't repost the YouTube link.
4369956	4371536	I'm very curious to check this out myself.
4372077	4373937	It is freaking awesome.
4374477	4375277	You should check it out.
4375297	4375857	It better be.
4376297	4379538	Because if I'm rebuying Kingdom Hearts 2 for it, it better be.
4380054	4384197	Alright, well, Yuni, thanks so much for the call, and take care, and good luck on your system hunting.
4384697	4385438	You too, thank you.
4385718	4386618	Bye-bye.
4387339	4389560	Alright, let's see if we get any more calls.
4390040	4390861	Ring, ring, ring.
4391081	4392662	Oh, well, that must be on the back line.
4393263	4394063	Hi, who's this?
4394183	4394844	This is Shane.
4395124	4397105	Oh, hey, Shane's standing right in front of me.
4397145	4397625	Hi, Shane.
4398006	4398466	Hi.
4398486	4398806	A.K.A.
4399386	4400127	Miklatov.
4400167	4401528	We can't call you Miklatov anymore.
4401548	4407812	Well, I had to change it because I'm trying to get into a pump group, and there was already a Miklatov in pumps, so I have to go buy my
4408263	4409944	More recent nickname of Arx.
4410024	4411105	Well, whatever the hell your name is.
4411125	4412085	That's why I just go by Shane.
4412145	4412785	Alright, then what do you want?
4413326	4415067	Crackdown's the best game ever.
4415107	4415507	I love it.
4415527	4416507	That's what's on my mind.
4416527	4418228	Yeah, I saw you unlock some achievements for me.
4418248	4418788	I appreciate that.
4418828	4419949	Heck yeah, it's so much fun.
4420990	4422370	I wasn't really getting into it.
4422410	4424992	What really do you love about this game?
4425232	4429774	You can jump really high, and you jump across rooftops, and you're like the tick, that superhero.
4430795	4432956	Was it just because I hadn't leveled up enough that I couldn't do it?
4433636	4437058	No, I think you just didn't understand what you were doing, and...
4437737	4438457	You're right, I didn't.
4438957	4442759	You're supposed to go and shoot people and kick them and jump from roof to roof.
4443019	4444079	And it's so much fun.
4444339	4445160	And I really want it.
4445560	4445920	All right.
4446200	4449861	Well, you can't have my copy because now that you've told me it's fun, I need to go back and play it more.
4449881	4450982	It's a terrible game.
4451782	4452062	Lies.
4452462	4452722	Yeah.
4452782	4453022	Lies.
4453742	4454923	You played Myst Online a little bit.
4454943	4455563	What did you think of that?
4456503	4461905	I think I would like it a whole lot if it didn't have the worst controls I've ever touched.
4462265	4463566	It's really terrible.
4463586	4464006	But it's simple.
4464813	4485748	Simply Hard, maybe if it had like a gamepad input thing I could use, but I can't use WASD and it's just, it goes back to that old Resident Evil style where up is always forward no matter which way you're facing and I don't dig that and the mouse is awkward to use.
4486508	4491632	But I think I will probably give it another shot because it was really cool because I like solving puzzle things.
4492626	4492927	Alright.
4493127	4494609	And Crackdown's a great game.
4495911	4496912	It's so much fun.
4497613	4501218	I would say something more, but it's probably like racist.
4501499	4502540	It is so funny.
4502580	4503401	Can I say it anyway?
4503662	4504102	I guess.
4504503	4507207	It's so much fun kicking the Mexicans in the head.
4512927	4515148	Orange Lounge Radio has just been banned from Mexico.
4515228	4515708	Look at that.
4515908	4516548	How do you like that?
4516848	4518469	That's the only part I'm at right now.
4518509	4523150	I'm sure once I beat that part, I can go kick some other race, but Mexicans are so easy targets.
4523230	4523990	All right, there you go.
4525391	4525751	Click.
4526071	4528191	DDR Dollar Bill says, Holy racist remark.
4529512	4530052	My God.
4530212	4531852	Actdeft is a Mexican.
4531892	4532793	Didn't like that comment.
4533513	4534513	Did not like that comment.
4535293	4539274	That's okay, because I'm like a quarter Brazilian, and that's all I know.
4539815	4540855	So I'm dirty, too.
4544755	4544995	Actdeft.com
4574474	4577155	Agent Otto, I don't recognize your name.
4577935	4578836	What do you want, Agent Otto?
4580196	4581537	Are you a new listener of Orange On Radio?
4582237	4583317	I'm from Elevator Action.
4584078	4584198	Oh!
4584798	4585498	Oh, God!
4585798	4589820	Oh, yes, Elevator Action, that horribly overrated game from the 1980s.
4590160	4591020	How are you, Agent Otto?
4591658	4592278	I'm doing great.
4592318	4595799	I don't know what your problem is with my game and what I do for a living.
4596199	4600700	I go into buildings, find documents, and not get shot in the head and not get crushed by elevators.
4600860	4601641	What do you do?
4601721	4604101	You sit there and talk about how bad my game is?
4604481	4610963	Well, Agent Otto, your game bored the shit out of me because it was pretty much the same joke after the first two minutes for, you know, hours on end.
4611823	4613724	You know the game's actually hard, right?
4615324	4616564	Yes, it is pretty hard.
4616604	4617885	That's another reason why I don't play it.
4619225	4619305	Oh.
4619784	4624247	Well, then you probably didn't play anything from the 80s then, because you clearly hate hard games.
4624347	4626908	No, I actually played a lot of games from the 80s, like Crystal Castles.
4626968	4632472	Actually, I don't know if you listened to the program last week, but we had a whole segment on 80s games that I played in Beat the Host.
4633952	4635233	I don't listen to your show.
4635914	4639035	I'm too busy going through... How did you get the number to this program then, Agent Otto?
4640116	4644859	Because I'm at DMN's house drinking beer, and I heard you talking shit about me.
4645019	4646240	Why are you hanging out with DMN?
4646280	4646760	He sucks.
4647642	4649503	because I have no one better to hang out with
4678510	4683711	And you can hear DMN here on Orange Lounge Radio on Thursday nights on STFU.
4683731	4685152	If you want to hear that.
4685352	4686752	Uni says DMN is not funny.
4687012	4688152	Aw, poor DMN.
4688632	4689433	Poor baby.
4690773	4691113	Alright.
4692253	4696574	Sorry to those folks we didn't get to, but we gotta get the show wrapped up because it's already like 20 minutes after 9.
4696994	4698155	We're running a little long tonight.
4698515	4699895	We'd like to go home at a decent hour tonight.
4700275	4703556	So if there's any more last minute stories, now's a good time to get them out.
4704396	4704616	Nope.
4705576	4705836	Loki?
4706837	4706997	Nope.
4707137	4708137	Let's go around and get everybody's
4708550	4709270	Final thought.
4710150	4710931	Loki, your final thought.
4712771	4713831	I need to finish Crackdown.
4714632	4715752	DarkSakura, your final thought.
4716352	4719093	I need to play more Captain America.
4720973	4722914	My final thought is Pants.
4725535	4730096	Thank you so much for tuning in to and supporting independent podcasting and independent gaming radio.
4730516	4734297	If you want to show your appreciation for Orange Lounge Radio and us doing this crap for free...
4735073	4742478	You can tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio because if everybody tells two people about Orange Lounge Radio, within weeks we will have taken over the world.
4742958	4743738	So thank you very much.
4744259	4753584	And if you have no friends to tell about Orange Lounge Radio, you can always leave us a nice review on iTunes or Dig or Podcast Alley or one of those sites.
4754005	4754965	That will work as well.
4755646	4755926	All right.
4756746	4758007	So that's going to do it for the show.
4758427	4760969	We'll see you here next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.
