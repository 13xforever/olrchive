0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	28000	And we are back on Orange Lounge Radio here with part B of our podcast or audio blog, audio cast, whatever you want to call it.
28000	32000	It's the audio archive of our program and it's split up into two parts.
32000	37000	Part A is released usually early, early Monday morning, late Sunday night, however you want to look at it.
37000	41000	Part B comes out sometime on Wednesday whenever we get around to uploading it.
41000	45000	But this is the second half of a continuing show that is taped live on Sunday nights.
45000	48000	And if you feel like coming down for a show, you should join us.
48000	52000	www.orangeloungeradio.com, we have a chat room, hi chat room.
52000	57000	And you missed our great bonus segment and things you can only hear live or on our rebroadcast at allgames.com.
57000	63000	We were playing porn or game and the sound effects were either from a porno or from a game.
63000	64000	It was awesome.
64000	67000	And we didn't do that well.
67000	68000	We only got 8 out of 10 I think.
68000	69000	So that was a B.
69000	71000	Jamie and I played together.
71000	72000	It was hot.
72000	73000	B for boobs.
73000	74000	Alright, anyhow.
74000	76000	Back into the news.
76000	78000	Starting off this segment with some pretty big news.
78000	80000	It has to do with the Halo 3 beta.
80000	84000	Rumor is that the Halo 3 beta is going to be split into two sessions.
84000	87000	The first session will begin on March 21st.
87000	90000	Seems pretty bold that these predictions are naming dates.
90000	95000	But this is from Xbox Portugal who also brought the first Halo 3 beta screenshots.
95000	99000	The first session will only be for those that got emails from Bungie.
99000	100000	That starts March 21st.
100000	104000	The second session will be also open to those who bought Crackdown.
104000	107000	That will end in June but no start date given for that yet.
107000	110000	But Loki, you were telling me during the break you heard this is bullshit.
110000	111000	Yeah, I heard it's bullshit.
111000	112000	How was it proven wrong?
112000	118000	I think it was either someone at Microsoft or someone at Bungie that said that it would just be one giant session.
118000	120000	That they weren't going to do two different ones.
120000	122000	Well there you have it.
122000	125000	So Xbox Portugal lies.
125000	126000	Maybe not.
126000	128000	Miscommunications or you know.
128000	133000	Yeah, Loki said Halo 3 would be coming out in the spring which was also a lie.
133000	135000	So there you have it.
135000	137000	That's alright, it happens.
137000	138000	Lies.
138000	139000	You should be ashamed.
139000	140000	No.
140000	144000	Something though that actually is pretty cool.
144000	154000	As announced in OXM, the Halo theme is going to be a downloadable track for Guitar Hero 2.
154000	158000	I think that's pretty cool.
158000	168000	It's definitely going to be something that I think is going to get a lot of people to look more into those downloaded tracks.
168000	170000	It's going to be something that's going to make a little bit of revenue so why not.
170000	172000	It'll be cool.
172000	175000	Hey here it's going to be free.
175000	177000	Which makes sense.
177000	178000	I like free.
178000	181000	And yeah it would be a good promotion for the Halo 3 game.
181000	185000	What I also want to know though is can Master Chief be one of the guitarists that you can play as.
185000	186000	That would be cool.
186000	187000	That would be awesome.
187000	190000	Because it was pretty awesome to have Master Chief in Dead or Alive 4.
190000	191000	Well it wasn't Master Chief.
191000	192000	Spartan.
192000	193000	Female Spartan.
193000	194000	Whatever.
194000	197000	You know having a Halo character in the game was kind of funny.
197000	198000	No.
198000	199000	Mistress Chief.
199000	200000	Sorry.
200000	201000	My bad.
201000	202000	Mistress Chief.
202000	203000	That would be Chieftess.
203000	204000	Anyway.
204000	205000	So yes.
205000	212000	One of my favorite topics of discussion is how people are hacking firmwares on consoles.
212000	221000	One very famous group, Team Executor, one of the ones I think pioneered some of the homebrew stuff on the PSP.
221000	226000	Have broken the firmware for the Xbox 360.
226000	243000	Now, right now there's apparently a, and they can't disclose too much, but there is a glitch in one of the older firmwares for the 360 that will allow you to use a copy of King Kong to run your own code.
243000	252000	Kind of similar to what they're doing with some of the older firmwares on the PSP where you could run homebrew with Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.
252000	262000	Apparently one of the shaders I guess that was in King Kong was actually unsigned and so they could buffer overflow it and cause it to run their own stuff.
262000	273000	And they actually released a proof of concept I think like Hello World or something like that that you can run on your 360 if you happen to have this firmware.
273000	277000	And apparently there's a way to check it by going to your system menu and stuff like that.
277000	290000	But like I said, if you're getting your automatic updates on live like most people are, you probably have already patched the hole in this because the problem has been patched in some of the future firmwares.
290000	298000	Basically right now there's no way to roll back the firmware kind of like you can do on the PSP.
298000	308000	Although if you have the older firmware there is apparently a thing you can break on the motherboard or something that you can do that will allow you to be able to roll it back no matter what firmware you have later on.
308000	313000	Can Microsoft just patch this right away?
313000	314000	They can.
314000	315000	They're pretty good.
315000	320000	Of all the companies they're the fastest at closing up these loopholes real quick.
320000	324000	At least on the 360 not so much Windows XP.
324000	334000	And right now really I don't think there's a way you can really detect this because it's being run in a game almost.
334000	344000	It's loading with a game so unless they just ban the use of King Kong altogether it's going to be pretty hard for them to stop it altogether.
344000	345000	I don't know though.
345000	347000	But they've already pretty much done.
347000	349000	They've patched the hole for this.
349000	355000	So I don't know there's not too much else I guess they can do right now about it.
355000	364000	But anyways as I was going to say the first proof of concept they've got out there and this was I believe on QJNet was shown.
364000	368000	At least they linked to it.
368000	369000	I can't remember what it was.
369000	371000	I think it's just a hello world type thing.
371000	373000	Yeah hello world pretty much.
373000	376000	This is some unsigned code.
376000	382000	So that's kind of interesting it's I guess the Hypervisor vulnerability.
382000	388000	It's found in kernel versions 4532 and 4548.
388000	397000	So apparently if you pull up your Xbox 360 under the system menu and look up system information.
397000	402000	There's a little thing on the bottom of the screen that says D and then there's a bunch of numbers and then K and a bunch of numbers.
402000	416000	If your kernel says 2.0 point and then the either the 40 or the what was it the 4532 4548 so yeah.
416000	417000	That's kind of cool though.
417000	420000	I mean got to start small and then they're just going to blow it up.
420000	433000	But the rumor is also Team Executor is going to be releasing a actual PS3 thing that's going to launch ISO's off the hard drive once the European launch happens.
433000	441000	So hopefully we'll see some more like that because I can't afford these expensive games.
441000	446000	Oh yes because the rampant piracy will certainly make the games even better.
446000	448000	That was sarcasm.
448000	453000	Hasn't hurt the PS2 any more or the PSP.
453000	462000	Well there are some franchises that every so often will rear their ugly heads in over the course of video gaming history.
462000	471000	Well Ubisoft has released information on the new Prince of Persia game for the Xbox 360.
471000	479000	Apparently it's going back to the roots of the game with more jumping around and grabbing stuff and climbing and things.
479000	484000	And the prince is going to have a gauntlet instead of a knife.
484000	490000	So it will be not so stabby oriented.
490000	491000	God.
491000	494000	Prince of Persia not so stabby.
494000	502000	I was never a fan of the Prince of Persia game so I'm like wow.
502000	504000	They're not bad. The new ones aren't bad.
504000	510000	I don't think they're quite like oh my god as a lot of people said they are but I played some of the older ones on GameTap.
510000	511000	They're not bad.
511000	515000	For a 3D action type game they're pretty solid.
515000	519000	It was a pretty good game and I don't know.
519000	520000	I can see why it does as well.
520000	528000	They have the one coming off the Wii, the port of two thrones I guess but Rival swords they call it something new because they added some chariot racing in there.
528000	534000	If you like Prince of Persia that's going to be a pretty cool game to check out.
534000	540000	Another cool thing about Prince of Persia is it's becoming a movie as well.
540000	547000	Disney is behind this as well as Jerry Brockheimer.
547000	551000	They're bringing Prince of Persia the Sands of Time and it is legit.
551000	553000	They've got some concept art on it.
553000	555000	That's pretty cool.
555000	559000	Didn't Disney already put out Aladdin?
559000	561000	Yes.
561000	564000	I think it would be a pretty cool action movie.
564000	566000	I'm looking forward to it.
566000	568000	Just don't fuck it up.
568000	575000	If they pull it off you might have a really good movie translation for a game.
575000	579000	It's been lacking lately.
579000	582000	Jamie, you're not a fan of the game but would the movie perk your interest?
582000	584000	Maybe it would work as a movie.
584000	585000	No.
585000	587000	That was very definitive. Why not?
587000	589000	Just not your thing?
589000	591000	The Arabian Nights thing not your thing?
591000	598000	I've seen Aladdin and I watched the Sinbad movie back in the day when it was a tiny color.
598000	599000	Well shit.
599000	607000	Anyway, of course you can download movies on iTunes and you can download music.
607000	610000	For those wondering where's all the gaming music?
610000	616000	Electronic Arts has launched the EA Tracks service as a part of iTunes.
616000	620000	Basically what they've done is they've compiled all the EA games.
620000	629000	The interesting thing is they've said music from all EA games past and present now available on the iTunes store.
629000	634000	Well, okay, but when you say all EA games past and present that makes me go wow.
634000	638000	You mean I could even go to the ECA games from the Commodore 64 days?
638000	639000	No.
639000	644000	Basically what that means is your burnouts, your sports games with the licensed music, the Madden's.
644000	646000	Any of the games with EA Tracks.
646000	651000	If you've got those EA Tracks you can download those songs on iTunes so there you go.
651000	656000	Did you know that Burnout Dominator is supposed to have Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend in it?
656000	661000	Which, oh boy, that's a pretty bad song.
661000	663000	I like the last one she did for the movie.
663000	664000	But.
664000	665000	This song's bad.
665000	666000	But.
666000	667000	That's not something I would want the EA name on.
667000	671000	Would it make you want to crash into things?
671000	673000	That's a very good point.
673000	676000	It's true that there's pedestrians in the next Burnout game.
676000	677000	It would make me want to run over them.
677000	679000	Dominator would not have pedestrians.
679000	680000	Dammit.
680000	686000	Dominator is kind of a best of built off the Revenge Engine I believe.
686000	691000	Well we have our own Revenge Engine built into Orange Lounge Radio and that is our mailbag.
691000	696000	When you guys don't like something you heard on the show, or you know when you like something you heard on the show.
696000	699000	You can send us an email to mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
699000	705000	and DarkSakura will open up the email bag and pull out some of her favorite emails to read here live on the program.
705000	708000	And I believe this week we got a lot of emails didn't we DarkSakura?
708000	710000	Uh yeah but I picked only a few.
710000	714000	So please don't be offended if your email is not read on air because some, you know it's weird.
714000	717000	Some weeks we get nothing, some week we get a bunch.
717000	720000	There's a few I'd like to go back and repost.
720000	725000	Probably on Tuesday I'll have them up on the site as well as the one from last week.
725000	730000	Alright well let's play the cute little theme music so we can get into the emails that you did select for this week.
737000	745000	The first email of the week without the sexy commentary actually comes from...
745000	747000	Email number one.
747000	749000	Hey Rob shut up.
749000	757000	Um comes from uh Heon. Uh dear OLR first of all I absolutely love the show you guys are excellent radio show hosts and are very talented.
757000	760000	Thank you so much for making the show so fun by interacting with your audience.
760000	765000	Onto my questions Super Mario Brothers Ocarina of Time, Kid Icarus, A Link to the Past.
765000	769000	These are just several of the classics that are currently available on the North American Virtual Console.
769000	771000	It's been only four months.
771000	774000	The Wii still has four to five years to go.
774000	777000	At this rate they're going to be scraping the bottom of the barrel near the end of its life.
777000	781000	I know that Nintendo's got a significant amount of masterpieces still to release on Virtual Console.
781000	783000	But are they going too fast?
783000	784000	Sincerely Heon.
784000	787000	P.S. Um I am now a Pastafarian thanks to the show.
787000	789000	FSM loves.
789000	791000	Flying Spaghetti Monster.
791000	792000	Wow.
792000	795000	I fear the day that Marissa has influence on anyone.
795000	796000	Um.
796000	798000	All hail his noodly goodness.
798000	799000	Love you Marissa.
799000	800000	Anyhow actually I actually.
800000	801000	She'll be up here in two weeks.
801000	802000	She's coming back.
802000	806000	A lot sooner than we thought so that's going to be a very interesting program.
806000	808000	Anyhow.
808000	810000	Back to the content of the email.
810000	811000	Um.
811000	812000	What was the email about again?
812000	815000	About if Nintendo's releasing whatever Rob.
815000	818000	Virtual Console games coming out too fast or whatever's going on.
818000	819000	Um.
819000	820000	Right now.
820000	821000	No.
821000	822000	I mean keep in mind what we were talking about earlier in the program.
822000	825000	That there's this big drought going on with the games.
825000	829000	And although Reggie Fils-Aime lied and said we wouldn't have these droughts this time around.
829000	833000	Keep in mind one thing he did say is that the Virtual Console releases, the big ones.
833000	837000	Would supplement the lack of Wii games during these slow periods.
837000	838000	So I think right now.
838000	839000	No.
839000	841000	They're not necessarily doing the Virtual Console games too fast.
841000	847000	I think this was probably a pretty decent time to release Ocarina and Kid Icarus and some of those really big titles people want.
847000	852000	I think when you get into November of this year when you know some of the bigger titles start coming out.
852000	854000	Hopefully your Mario Galaxy.
854000	856000	Probably your Metroid and so on and so on.
856000	857000	Um.
857000	859000	You're probably going to see the Virtual Console releases get very slowed up.
859000	862000	Maybe you'll get one new game a week.
862000	865000	From some obscure title.
865000	866000	Like we're starting to see.
866000	869000	You have to admit now on the TurboGrafx-16 and Genesis side.
869000	872000	We're really starting to dip into the obscure games coming out on Virtual Console.
872000	874000	I've never even heard of a lot of those games coming out.
874000	875000	Um.
875000	879000	Especially but if they're going to open up the door to Commodore 64.
879000	882000	As I believe the rumor had said before that Commodore 64 is a possibility coming.
882000	885000	And as well as MSX and so on.
885000	888000	Especially if they blow up in that Commodore 64 door.
888000	891000	That is going to be a shitload of games that they can add there as well.
891000	893000	I guess it would depend on what publishers.
893000	894000	Um.
894000	897000	I think there's still a lot of room for Virtual Console to go.
897000	898000	Uh.
898000	901000	And hopefully someday we'll start getting the multiplayer add-ons.
901000	904000	Maybe some of our games will be enabled for multiplayer slowly but surely.
904000	906000	Maybe we'll get our cheat codes.
906000	909000	I could see that as something that happens slowly but surely in 2008.
909000	911000	I want Icarus to fight Medusa Angels.
911000	913000	And I want my Justin Bailey in Metroid.
913000	915000	And hopefully originals too.
915000	916000	Don't we want some Wii originals?
916000	918000	Some more original Wii games?
918000	919000	Heck yeah.
919000	922000	That would be hopefully where the console goes in 2008 and 2009.
922000	924000	So we will see what happens.
924000	926000	Next email is very special.
926000	929000	Dear OLR crew, my name is Rama from Indonesia.
929000	931000	I am a classic video game lover.
931000	937000	I believe that I am probably the first person from Indonesia becoming one of your loyal fans.
937000	938000	Right now I have to know.
938000	940000	I'm going to check stats.
940000	943000	Right now I'm working as a journalist and most of my articles about technology and video games.
943000	946000	I'm also working as a local video game music composer.
946000	949000	One thing that will probably surprise you that I am blind.
949000	953000	I was born with only 10% sight ability after being operated.
953000	955000	Now how can I operate a computer?
955000	960000	I'm using screen reader that enables me to read object shown on my laptop so I can read and write,
960000	962000	browse the internet, and even download your show.
962000	967000	When I was a child I was so interested in video games because it had attractive sounds and graphics.
967000	973000	I even owned an Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, NES, Genesis, and SNES.
973000	976000	With only 10% sight I could still enjoy classic games.
976000	980000	I could not recognize objects or details, but I could still understand, for instance,
980000	982000	which one is my hero and which one is the enemy.
982000	986000	I even finished many famous classic games such as Super Mario series, Contra, Gradius,
986000	988000	Sonic series, and many more.
988000	991000	But when 3D gaming era came out, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Saturn,
991000	995000	I decided to give up because I could not play games with so many movements.
995000	999000	After that I decided to enjoy video games in other fashions.
999000	1004000	I started to record or collect music from games I played.
1004000	1006000	I'll share with you some of my listening later.
1006000	1009000	So now on to my comments about you guys.
1009000	1011000	Scroll down.
1011000	1013000	Well, I could not say a word but awesome.
1013000	1018000	Your podcast is the first experience enjoying video games news on an audio forum.
1018000	1021000	I actually found your site last January and started to become your fan.
1021000	1026000	I even quoted some of your information in my articles.
1026000	1030000	Sky Logie and DarkSakura, you are the craziest gang I have ever loved.
1030000	1037000	I feel like having lots of friends video game folks that refreshes my energy and brain during the working hour.
1037000	1042000	You should know that not many Indonesians have intention to talk about video games that much.
1042000	1045000	And man, your other soldiers are awesome too.
1045000	1049000	I suggest that you go on this way and besides video games, bring along more laughter and joy.
1049000	1051000	Oh, that's so sweet. There's more.
1051000	1052000	Wow.
1052000	1057000	Those are reasons I keep downloading your show even though Indonesian internet connection is like a turtle crawling along the beach.
1057000	1061000	That requires more than 12 hours to download your A and B segment.
1061000	1063000	But that's fine as I can enjoy your show.
1063000	1066000	I don't know if this one will ever interest you but have you ever tried audio games?
1066000	1071000	This is another genre of gaming which was built specifically for the blind so they can play games too.
1071000	1077000	There are many kinds of games such as card games with voice, chess and even more advanced platforms like RPG, spaceship battle games.
1077000	1079000	It takes advantage of stereo sound systems.
1079000	1082000	For example, if you're playing spaceship battle game and your enemy is on your left,
1082000	1085000	you can hear their ship on your left speaker and can shoot them.
1085000	1087000	You can also chase them if they dodge your attack.
1087000	1090000	Let's say they move from left to right.
1090000	1092000	I'm going to scroll down.
1092000	1094000	Again, pay attention to the speaker.
1094000	1098000	And it did something like that with that Atari controller that you use your forehead to play.
1098000	1102000	And Sega did a couple of audio only games on the Saturn.
1102000	1105000	You can try them here. It's at audiogames.net.
1105000	1107000	I wonder if it can be Dark Sakura Side of the Week.
1107000	1109000	We'll see.
1109000	1111000	Well, I think that's all I can share.
1111000	1113000	I hope I keep in touch with you guys.
1113000	1115000	This email can be read on air.
1115000	1122000	As for joining your show via Skype, I think it is difficult because the connection, like I've mentioned before, is very slow to make such a call.
1122000	1124000	Plus the time difference.
1124000	1132000	Lastly, I'm working on an Xbox 360 project along with a local game developer at max-studio.net to produce independent games.
1132000	1139000	Well, I don't really know about the program, but I heard that Microsoft is holding a contest for XNA Game Engine to produce games for 360.
1139000	1140000	So I hope I can do well.
1140000	1141000	Good luck for you guys.
1141000	1144000	I will probably make an interview and write more about your show later.
1144000	1147000	P.S. I love Chicken Shoot.
1147000	1149000	It's signed by Rama.
1149000	1151000	I think that came up the week you weren't here, Dark Sakura.
1151000	1154000	There was a game called Chicken Shoot.
1154000	1157000	Wow, what an amazing email.
1157000	1158000	That was really cool.
1158000	1163000	There's a lot that we take for granted sometimes, I think.
1163000	1172000	Emails like this can be very humbling in a way that sometimes we take for granted our mega fast internet connections we have, our site that we have to play video games.
1172000	1184000	You know what's interesting is actually this person is not the first person I've heard on a gaming podcast talk about the difficulty of being legally blind, so to speak.
1184000	1187000	Just because you're legally blind doesn't mean you can't see it all.
1187000	1190000	Like this guy said, he has 10% vision.
1190000	1198000	It makes perfect sense for things that are 2D with minimal movement going on to be much easier to see than our 3D games.
1198000	1214000	I imagine that actually it might even be easier to see the smaller sprites, the collection of sprites as they'll have a cleaner color palette than even things moving around in life.
1214000	1222000	We take our vision for granted, just all the things that go on around us but the moment that it's gone.
1222000	1225000	That's actually a good thing that I think is really neat about this audio game.
1225000	1230000	This goes back to my love of the Discovery Channel.
1230000	1243000	They were talking about how they had a group of blind people riding their bicycle down the road using clicking to determine location of cars and other things in the road.
1243000	1262000	Their study group actually managed to avoid children running out on the road, avoided trash in the street by using their sense of hearing to determine space relation around them.
1262000	1273000	They say that if you lose one capability, your other capabilities become so much more sensitive so that really makes sense I think.
1273000	1280000	I'd be very curious what this listener has to think about the Wii because he does have at least the 10% sight.
1280000	1289000	The Wii is interesting because it has that rumble and the speaker that's actually in the Wiimote as well as the rumble depending on where your cursor is on screen.
1289000	1292000	It could help you identify if you're pointing at a certain object.
1292000	1305000	I imagine not all games would work but I'm kind of curious could the Wii maybe be something that would help bring the sky back into gaming where the 3D games and the ultra-intensive graphics have made him unable to play.
1305000	1310000	I would have never known about this type of sight and the way they make these games.
1310000	1313000	I guess I'm just ignorant that way. I would have never known how to not pay for this email.
1313000	1315000	Thank you very much for the email.
1315000	1317000	I'm going to check that site out just because I want to know.
1317000	1319000	I want to see what kind of games there are.
1319000	1328000	There have been other games and I don't think they were necessarily brought out for the blind in particular but Sega, there were a number of Saturn games that focused only on audio.
1328000	1335000	There was one game that came with a packet of seeds where you had to use the audio to raise a plant.
1335000	1342000	Very interesting. Alpha Canagram reminds us and SSG100 Matt chimes in too about how Ellen actually gave a blind kid a Wii on her show.
1342000	1344000	Remember that? That was some gaming news a while back.
1344000	1351000	That was before the Wii's were even out. So kind of an interesting reminder there from the chat room.
1351000	1353000	That's why we love chat because they remember things and we don't.
1353000	1356000	This next email comes from Bear Who Drive Car.
1356000	1357000	I love that name.
1357000	1361000	That's so great. French fries, sorry.
1361000	1366000	Okay, I have to stop for just a minute. Loki, what the hell is it? You have DDR fifth mix on your PSP?
1366000	1367000	Yeah.
1367000	1369000	What are you hacking over there?
1369000	1372000	I was putting the PS1 image on here.
1372000	1379000	God, I'm so far behind on my PlayStation. Dang, you mean if I get a card you can do that with PlayStation 1 games for my PSP?
1379000	1387000	Yeah, you put a custom firmware on there and you can convert any PS1 image to play on a PSP given that you have the big enough...
1387000	1392000	Now my next question for you is why the fuck do you have DDR on your PSP?
1392000	1396000	So I can play with the controller. That's how I play normally.
1396000	1397000	Back to the emails.
1397000	1398000	Sorry.
1398000	1404000	Anyway, yo, just writing to vent about the Wii. I do like it, but you guys mentioned that there are too many controllers.
1404000	1406000	Well, I can't agree more.
1406000	1408000	First I got Super Mario Brothers with the Wii mode.
1408000	1411000	It's kind of odd because of the shape and size, but that was okay.
1411000	1416000	Then I got Smash Brothers Melee and all of a sudden to play multiplayer I needed two GameCube controllers.
1416000	1418000	Okay, not too bad.
1418000	1422000	Then I bought Contra and that's when I noticed if you try to play with the GameCube controller...
1422000	1429000	No, I try to play with the GameCube controller, but if you recall the locations, the YB on SNES and Game Boy controllers are totally different.
1429000	1433000	By the way, I hate the GameCube controller and it's asymmetrically sized buttons.
1433000	1436000	So now I have to buy a Wii Classic Controller, two for multiplayer.
1436000	1438000	I've also purchased three Wiimotes and four Nunchucks.
1438000	1448000	So Nintendo Wii $250, three Wiimotes $120, four Nunchucks $80, two GameCube controllers $40, two Wii Classic controllers $40.
1448000	1452000	Spending $530 to play a glorified GameCube, priceless.
1452000	1457000	Fanboys claiming the Wii is a value system cannot be more wrong.
1457000	1464000	I get the point, but at the same time you didn't have to buy the controllers.
1464000	1467000	You just didn't like the way it felt on the GameCube controllers.
1467000	1472000	And again, you're not forced to even buy Contra or any Super Nintendo game at all.
1472000	1477000	Whereas PlayStation 3, you have to buy a Blu-ray drive, like it or not.
1477000	1481000	Granted, I'm comparing apples to oranges a little bit here,
1481000	1484000	but I think that's where your point kind of has a little bit of a flaw.
1484000	1489000	You're saying that you feel you have to buy these to have that.
1489000	1493000	And again, I don't have four Wii controllers.
1493000	1495000	I probably didn't even really need to get a second one.
1495000	1499000	I just did it because we usually have a lot of people over and I wanted to play Wii Tennis.
1499000	1503000	But ideally, a lot of people have their own Wiimotes and so on and so on.
1503000	1504000	I do get what you're saying though.
1504000	1507000	There are a lot of hidden fees, but you kind of get that with every console.
1507000	1511000	PlayStation 3 doesn't come with a component cable, if I remember right.
1511000	1515000	Wasn't that something we covered on a previous show that actually didn't come with the component or HDMI cable?
1515000	1518000	PlayStation 3 only came with the other one.
1518000	1526000	Xbox 360, granted their premium unit is much better than their core unit, coming with a lot of the basics.
1526000	1529000	But if you want to get a wireless headset, that's more money.
1529000	1534000	And I say, yeah, you kind of do need that wireless headset if I want to play DDR or so on.
1534000	1540000	Anyhow, interesting point, but I think a slightly flawed one.
1540000	1542000	I don't know.
1542000	1550000	I think that there's something to it, but it all depends on how far you'll go for the sake of convenience.
1550000	1552000	Anyway, next email comes up.
1552000	1555000	Actually, granted, could I just say some quick points from chat that came up here?
1555000	1557000	Let's see, what's going on?
1557000	1559000	Leon wants to start a fight here.
1559000	1562000	You are not good enough for the GameCube controller, you noob.
1562000	1565000	And Blay says, boo-fucking-hoo, do your research before you buy a system.
1565000	1567000	So a couple of people throw in some rocks there.
1567000	1570000	SkyWarrior, that's with a Y, not an I.
1570000	1573000	Says, value, what makes the Wii so compelling?
1573000	1576000	Too bad the PlayStation 3 has no value as of now.
1576000	1578000	Very interesting.
1578000	1580000	And some interesting comments there from the chat room there.
1580000	1585000	James Patrick says, a lot of Wii games only need one remote, and you pass it around.
1585000	1588000	So, kind of interesting there. Ooh, food.
1588000	1597000	And also they have games coming out now like Wing Island and Koro Impa that use one remote and Nunchuck for two players.
1597000	1601000	So they've got all that stuff going on.
1601000	1604000	Jamie's got them out. I don't want that now after you put your mouth all over it.
1604000	1606000	I only ate off one side of it.
1606000	1608000	It's fine. It doesn't look that good anyway.
1608000	1610000	I'm starting South Beach tomorrow again.
1610000	1612000	Anyway.
1612000	1618000	This email actually is not the last one. It comes from Nekky.
1618000	1623000	Really the one thing that I wanted to go in here.
1623000	1626000	And it's a really long email, and this is going to be one that I'm going to leave on the website.
1626000	1628000	But I wanted to mention this.
1628000	1637000	I like the idea of telling people, now you have posted a site plug for you on my home forum, dscommunity.co.uk, to plug the site for them.
1637000	1645000	And Xbox 360 Fanatics link is z6.envisionfree.com slash 360 underscore fanatics slash index dot php.
1645000	1649000	We are currently quite small, but invite everyone to join no matter where you are.
1649000	1652000	And that includes you, Jamie, Loki, and Rob.
1652000	1657000	I wanted to do that, though, just because Nekky writes us regularly.
1657000	1663000	And I'm going to be posting this in the thing, but I thought that it would be nice for me to go ahead and give the little plug.
1663000	1672000	I remember the first email from the taped segment was a loving rant about the last few episodes.
1672000	1679000	I do feel slightly likewise, but I agree with you, Jamie and Rob, that it does keep your show unique.
1679000	1683000	Inviting Casper the Gay and Rice Princess every week may not be such a good idea, though.
1683000	1688000	I do not hold anything against them, but having them on every week would alter many people's views of your show.
1688000	1691000	Well, that's why these folks are guests, not hosts.
1691000	1693000	Well, you said it out of love, not hate.
1693000	1694000	Gotcha.
1694000	1699000	Anyway, that one's going to get reposted.
1699000	1702000	Sorry, I'm actually trying to do a search. I want to see where this post comes up.
1702000	1705000	I'm looking at this site. It's dscommunity.co.uk.
1705000	1708000	It's a whole little DS, and I imagine there's lots of friend code training going on.
1708000	1709000	Oh, here it is.
1709000	1714000	There's actually a forum called Plug a Site, and there's this post there.
1714000	1719000	Great site for podcasts and live shows focusing on video gaming.
1719000	1722000	Past available on iTunes, MP3 download available on actual website.
1722000	1724000	Covers release dates for most of the world.
1724000	1726000	Most are accurate, as they have insider sources.
1726000	1728000	One of the guys works for a game distribution company.
1728000	1731000	Good fun to listen to, especially when you have nothing to do or on a commute.
1731000	1734000	I like that. Orange Launch Radio, better than nothing.
1734000	1735000	Yeah.
1735000	1737000	No, thank you very much for the plug.
1737000	1738000	We appreciate that.
1738000	1743000	You are a true veteran of the O.L. Army, and we salute you.
1743000	1746000	We got an email from Gaming Nerd about...
1746000	1748000	Nerd.
1748000	1750000	Hey, now.
1750000	1753000	Anyway, from Gaming Nerd, it says,
1753000	1756000	Hey, O.L.R., I know this is kind of a risky subject to mention,
1756000	1760000	but I feel it must be heard so that people understand what could be happening in the future in gaming.
1760000	1765000	After listening to Loki's rant in the last week's episode about there not being any good games for PS3 and 360,
1765000	1771000	and only average ones, it got me looking back at the numerous anonymous sites that I've been to.
1771000	1772000	Excuse me.
1772000	1776000	I'm finding it pretty easy to download pirated PS2 and Xbox games off the net,
1776000	1780000	and bringing them to DVDRs and playing them on modded consoles.
1780000	1783000	Knowing how easy it is to download PS2 and Xbox games,
1783000	1787000	it gets you wondering just how much money game companies are losing just from these two consoles.
1787000	1789000	With that loss in money,
1789000	1793000	there's only so much money that can be spent to produce average titles of the kind of graphics power
1793000	1797000	and development tools that are provided for the PS3 and 360.
1797000	1800000	It's no wonder the Wii is overtaking the competition with its console
1800000	1806000	for the simple reason that the GameCube ran games off unique media that wasn't easily accessible to the public.
1806000	1810000	Thus, more money was earned through the sales in the games for the GameCube,
1810000	1815000	and money being able to produce the awesomeness that is the Wii and its games.
1815000	1823000	Also, something I should point out is that Nintendo has been notorious for proprietary software
1823000	1827000	for their storage capacity.
1827000	1833000	This is probably one of the reasons why I think Square jumped ship with them with the Final Fantasy franchise.
1833000	1838000	It'll only be a matter of time before we see a Blu-ray burner and PS3 games get pirated.
1838000	1844000	A mod ship is released to the console, which will result in even more money lost to the companies that make their games for the PS3.
1844000	1848000	I'm even more surprised the Japanese market isn't complaining about piracy,
1848000	1853000	but that you could only mean there's much more loyal to gaming than some of us here in the States.
1853000	1858000	Especially when it comes to buying my PS2 imports, I'm more than willing to spend $64 to buy games like Puyo Puyo Fever 2,
1858000	1863000	Melty Blood, DDR Supernova, BeatMania 2DX, and supporting the companies that made these games.
1863000	1866000	And like most people that I've heard who just go ahead and download imports,
1866000	1873000	since they either can't find a store that sells them or don't want to spend an extra $14 off everyday $50 US titles,
1873000	1875000	they might have just come out.
1875000	1880000	Anyways, I hope this letter gives a better understanding as to why big names aren't really as big anymore,
1880000	1885000	as it partially is due to the loss of money and loss of quality for the games themselves.
1885000	1891000	I can remember when it was really big news for a game like Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo, and Final Fantasy to get new sequels,
1891000	1896000	but nowadays it's just the same thing because there isn't enough money to do much else in the games.
1896000	1902000	Unique aspects are gone and there's not much else we can say about gaming other than stop the piracy and the magical return.
1902000	1904000	You're truly a gaming nerd.
1904000	1910000	Very often you hear from people who are willing to defend the fact that video game piracy is a bad thing.
1910000	1912000	So, very interesting email.
1912000	1916000	Don't copy that floppy, as a famous musician once said.
1916000	1922000	Loki, I'm curious what your feedback is on this whole piracy is bad for the industry angle.
1922000	1930000	Sure, it's bad for the industry, but to be honest, nowadays a lot of the stuff, if it's not worth playing,
1930000	1934000	I won't even go and pirate it or anything like that. I'll just not play it.
1934000	1941000	But, I mean, I guess I buy normally, I mean, I buy a lot of stuff that just comes out
1941000	1945000	and I find out, you know, the hard way that a lot of the games do suck.
1945000	1949000	So I can see where a lot of people get burned by these games that, you know, get great reviews
1949000	1955000	and they're like, what the fuck? This is crap. Driver 3, for example.
1955000	1963000	Yeah, piracy is, especially if you make it so easy, like it is on the PlayStation 2, or even the original PlayStation,
1963000	1968000	yeah, it's going to be a huge issue, but I don't know. It's all morals.
1968000	1971000	If you think stealing is bad, then you're not going to do it, but, you know.
1971000	1978000	Bandit says, bad for the industry, but good for Loki, in our chat room.
1978000	1983000	GS68 says, I buy legit copies, though I admit I've done my share of ROM downloading.
1983000	1990000	I think ROMs are not quite as bad. In fact, they're really not as bad, because usually the things you're pirating ROMs of.
1990000	1995000	I mean, if you're doing current DS games, that's one thing, but if you're downloading ROMs of, you know,
1995000	2002000	years old, you know, Commodore 64 and NES games that folks aren't going to be, you know, playing anytime soon,
2002000	2005000	or selling anytime soon, that's not as bad.
2005000	2011000	For the record, I have DDR5 mix at home. I just don't have a copy that'll work on my PSP.
2011000	2018000	You might say Virtual Console makes ROMs bad, but I don't know. I'll admit, I've downloaded my fair share of ROMs.
2018000	2022000	Charging $5 for an NES game makes Virtual Console bad.
2022000	2027000	I have a ROM of Kid Icarus on my computer. I don't like to play Kid Icarus on my computer.
2027000	2033000	I like to play it on my television like I did when I was a kid, so for that, it was worth the $5 to me,
2033000	2035000	because I love Kid Icarus that much.
2035000	2039000	To be honest, I've got to play PS1 games on my PSP, because what else am I going to play?
2039000	2045000	Grand Theft Auto? I mean, seriously, what else is out for the PSP?
2045000	2047000	A whole lot of stuff I'm not interested in.
2047000	2049000	It sounds like a lot of stuff coming soon, though.
2049000	2051000	Soon. It's always coming soon.
2051000	2053000	Ah, whatever, whatever.
2053000	2055000	Anyway, may I read the next email?
2055000	2056000	You sure may.
2056000	2059000	Thank you. Last email.
2059000	2065000	Hiya, guys. I just want to know what it is that we in Europe and Australia have done to piss off Sony.
2065000	2068000	Whatever it was, I'm sure we could apologize.
2068000	2070000	It's the funny accents.
2070000	2072000	No, shut up.
2072000	2075000	Maybe come to some kind of arrangement.
2075000	2077000	You don't get this kind of treatment in America.
2077000	2080000	How come? Is it cash, bribes, sexual favors?
2080000	2084000	I'm sure you know why it is I'm feeling hard done by.
2084000	2088000	I was accepting of the higher price tag. We are used to that.
2088000	2090000	Also, the late release date.
2090000	2092000	I've only just bought my copy of Final Fantasy XII.
2092000	2097000	We're used to having to wait, but waiting longer to pay extra for an inferior piece of hardware is taking the biscuit.
2097000	2099000	Full backwards compatibility.
2099000	2101000	Well, there's another thing. You call it a biscuit.
2101000	2102000	I mean, come on.
2102000	2103000	Rob!
2103000	2104000	The expression is take the cake.
2104000	2107000	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, shut up.
2107000	2108000	What?
2108000	2110000	I'm just, obviously I'm kidding. Come on.
2110000	2111000	Stuff it!
2111000	2113000	Thank you.
2113000	2116000	I'm going to flip Jamie off the British way. There you go.
2116000	2117000	Up your arse.
2117000	2120000	Hey, two fingers salute for you.
2120000	2123000	You're being a real tit.
2123000	2126000	Don't be such a tit.
2126000	2132000	I'm done. I promise.
2132000	2138000	To use a bit of proper colloquialism. Rob's doing my head in here.
2138000	2140000	So shall I continue?
2140000	2141000	I suppose.
2141000	2143000	Okay. Wanker.
2143000	2151000	Full backwards compatibility was one of the biggest selling points for the PS2 for me and would have been on the PS3.
2151000	2160000	Being able to play a session of San Andreas and putting on Bishi Bashi Special if mates come over without switching consoles or messing with wires is important to me.
2160000	2164000	I'm starting to wonder whether Sony actually wants to sell any consoles over here.
2164000	2167000	PS3s are available on pre-order from every UK shop and website.
2167000	2174000	No one is worried about shortages because there are none and there is a conspicuous lack of interest in the approaching release.
2174000	2179000	Is there any way of getting an import yet or have Sony still got sniffer dogs in customs?
2179000	2181000	IBOs maybe?
2181000	2184000	Asiya Lee, Marketing Manager, OLR, UK Division.
2184000	2186000	Oh, yes. This guy.
2186000	2187000	Yes.
2187000	2189000	Amazing work.
2189000	2193000	Bandit calls this whole thing bux.
2193000	2195000	That's a bandit has to say about it.
2195000	2199000	I offered you some. Don't give me that look.
2199000	2200000	What?
2200000	2202000	You're looking at my cupcake and then I ate that big thing of icing.
2202000	2204000	It looks like a yummy cupcake, but I don't want it.
2204000	2205000	I offered you some.
2205000	2206000	Cupcakes make me fat. I don't want it.
2206000	2209000	You put your fingers all over that cupcake.
2209000	2211000	You haven't even like torn off the paper.
2211000	2213000	You've just dived into the cupcake.
2213000	2217000	I asked you if you wanted some and you said no so I started licking the ice.
2217000	2219000	Don't be such a twat.
2219000	2222000	You're being a real twat.
2222000	2223000	Wanker.
2223000	2225000	Anyway, no seriously.
2225000	2229000	I think the reason why Europe gets shit on is I think they sell the least amount of consoles there.
2229000	2230000	The end.
2230000	2232000	Right? Am I right?
2232000	2233000	No.
2233000	2235000	Loki says I'm wrong.
2235000	2237000	I would think that's what it is.
2237000	2239000	I don't know.
2239000	2243000	Don't they sell more consoles in Japan and America than they do in Europe?
2243000	2245000	Maybe.
2245000	2248000	I guess it depends what you consider to be Europe.
2248000	2252000	Do you consider Europe to be everything on the other side of the Atlantic?
2252000	2255000	Or do you consider Europe to be, you know...
2255000	2260000	I just think that they think that their US and Japan markets are more important than their UK markets.
2260000	2264000	They want to make sure they have enough consoles for us because we're spending more money on games.
2264000	2274000	I always said the TVs too because the Japan and US share the same TV format standard whereas NTSC...
2274000	2276000	It doesn't matter with HD.
2276000	2280000	If Sony's really pushing the HD format then having PAL or NTSC is not going to matter.
2280000	2289000	But not everybody has an HD TV yet so the systems have to work with the old TVs whether they are whoring up the HD angle or not.
2289000	2291000	That should be pretty easy to do though.
2291000	2293000	Just a thought.
2293000	2298000	You have to figure out what components they're going to take out of your PS3 so that they can lower the price on their end.
2298000	2301000	That's what they have to do.
2301000	2304000	All right. Well, we don't know.
2304000	2308000	That's the Sony question we've given you our thoughts though.
2308000	2315000	Regardless, it's not nice that they keep giving you the shot over there on the different games.
2315000	2316000	Rob.
2316000	2318000	What?
2318000	2320000	I'm sorry. No.
2320000	2323000	The international listeners ought to know I love them.
2323000	2325000	I tease because I love.
2325000	2328000	As somebody in chats, I don't even know who said this here.
2328000	2331000	Who said my accents were so bad they were good?
2331000	2333000	Somebody there said my accents are so bad.
2333000	2335000	Oh, there it is.
2335000	2339000	Sky Warrior says Sky's accents are so bad they're funny.
2339000	2344000	Uni says Sky's accents are like my mom trying to do a British accent and completely miserably failing at it.
2344000	2345000	Oh, goodie.
2345000	2346000	Now I'm like your mom.
2346000	2349000	That's a very nice compliment.
2349000	2350000	Like your mom.
2350000	2352000	Orange Lounge Radio.
2352000	2354000	It's like your mom.
2354000	2356000	Go leave that on an iTunes review.
2356000	2362000	I want one of our British listeners to record that for us so that we can make a bumper out of it.
2362000	2363000	We need to bring back the bumpers.
2363000	2364000	I missed the bumper.
2364000	2365000	Orange Lounge Radio.
2365000	2366000	It's like your mom.
2366000	2368000	I could do that better.
2368000	2369000	I could do that better.
2369000	2370000	All right. Sorry.
2370000	2371000	Forget it.
2371000	2372000	No, seriously. I could.
2372000	2373000	Any more emails?
2373000	2374000	No.
2374000	2375000	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
2375000	2377000	Send us more.
2377000	2380000	Send emails. My accent wants some fan mails.
2380000	2382000	We need to do what this says.
2382000	2385000	You lose because we say so.
2385000	2387000	You're just crazy.
2387000	2401000	Apparently the rumor is much like the online libraries, they are also withholding the Mii libraries for the Nintendo Wii from third-party developers
2401000	2405000	and not letting them develop games that will utilize the Miis,
2405000	2414000	which is kind of disappointing because I would like to use my Miis in a lot more things than just Wii Sports or WarioWare, I guess.
2414000	2416000	I don't see why they don't.
2416000	2418000	Don't use your Miis in Grand Theft Auto.
2418000	2420000	Oh, my God. That would be awesome.
2420000	2422000	That would be so cool.
2422000	2430000	Even stuff like maybe your face or something on SSX Blur or something like that.
2430000	2432000	Create a character type thing.
2432000	2433000	Or your mom.
2433000	2436000	Literally put your mom in the game.
2436000	2438000	Something like that, yeah.
2438000	2440000	I don't know why they don't. I think it's stupid.
2440000	2446000	But if it's anything like the online stuff was, they want to make sure they get it right first before they put it out to everybody.
2446000	2450000	Which is a poor excuse if you ask me, but whatever.
2450000	2456000	I'm sure, like the online, it will be something that's implemented later on.
2456000	2459000	While it may not be happening now, it will happen later.
2459000	2462000	Yeah, third-parties will get their Miis soon enough.
2462000	2465000	Although I agree, they should have had it from the start.
2465000	2470000	Well, GameTap, we mentioned in part A when I was talking about Myst online.
2470000	2476000	What should be noted is that GameTap is also now starting to really get behind the independent game movement.
2476000	2479000	Seems like a really good fit for GameTap, if you ask me.
2479000	2483000	Well, GameTap has announced they're going to be doing a new indie game label.
2483000	2489000	What they're going to do, they're going to sign and distribute any worthy indie project over the GameTap service.
2489000	2493000	This would be a really great way to get your game out there, because GameTap has their user base.
2493000	2496000	They won't say how big it is, which makes me think it's not that big.
2496000	2501000	I don't know, I guess a lot of people are still not willing to fork over the $10 a month to pay the games.
2501000	2506000	But this would be a really great way for GameTap to get more games that you can't get other places.
2506000	2510000	I think it's a really good fit for GameTap and a smart thing for them to be doing right now.
2510000	2513000	If you want more information, GameTap.com.
2513000	2520000	They will also probably be announcing, I believe I read somewhere else, not this particular article I'm looking at now.
2520000	2526000	I believe they announced somewhere else that a game developer conference are going to announce the first batch of games that are going to be on the indie label.
2526000	2528000	So that's kind of cool.
2528000	2531000	So, Loki, is this something that might get you on GameTap finally?
2531000	2535000	Nope. I don't have time to be paying for online monthly subscriptions for games.
2535000	2538000	I thought I'd ask anyway.
2538000	2544000	Excuse me. I'm sorry, I was just choking up a baby.
2544000	2550000	Okay. Apparently this show has that effect on people.
2550000	2557000	I'm sorry. I just coughed up a baby listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2557000	2564000	They were talking about babies flying out of vaginas in one part and in the second part they coughed up a baby.
2564000	2566000	It's amazing.
2566000	2573000	Okay. There is some love coming out thanks to SNK.
2573000	2581000	Art of Fighting actually is going to be having a collection to be released stateside.
2581000	2589000	Art of Fighting was a very interesting game because it was a big definite knockoff in some respects of Street Fighter II,
2589000	2595000	what with, you know, Rio and, you know, Robert Garcia and all of them.
2595000	2599000	Two of them also gave us Dan and later ones too.
2599000	2601000	But, I don't know. It's kind of cool.
2601000	2604000	I always liked Art of Fighting because they did name a fighter after me.
2604000	2607000	Having a rob in a fighting game was pretty cool.
2607000	2610000	I also like that old school zoom in and out effect it did.
2610000	2612000	Art of Fighting, though, gave us King.
2612000	2613000	That's right.
2613000	2614000	And King was awesome.
2614000	2616000	Big ol' lesbian.
2616000	2621000	And Yuri with the flying butt attack.
2621000	2624000	Got a lot of flying butt attacks.
2624000	2627000	In fact, I'm going to do a flying butt attack on Dark Sakura right now.
2627000	2630000	Get your ass off me.
2630000	2632000	I've been rubbed with gay ass.
2632000	2637000	Anyways, if you like ridiculous weapons much like Rob's flying butt attack,
2637000	2642000	then you're definitely going to love Worms HD, which is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
2642000	2644000	Speaking of ass worms.
2644000	2647000	Finally, this Wednesday.
2647000	2649000	So, that is awesome.
2649000	2653000	It's supposed to be 800 Microsoft points or $10 in real money.
2653000	2655000	And it's awesome.
2655000	2656000	It's Worms.
2656000	2657000	It's 2D.
2657000	2660000	And, yeah, I can't wait to play it.
2660000	2663000	It's about fucking time this game came out to Xbox Live Arcade.
2663000	2665000	Exploding Sheep, no Holy Hand Grenade.
2665000	2670000	That's the only disappointment for me, but that is still a fucking awesome game.
2670000	2674000	Oh, Lord, bless this thy hand grenade.
2674000	2679000	Well, what could also be very awesome for Xbox Live Arcade would be Sam and Max.
2679000	2681000	And there are rumors abounding.
2681000	2686000	There's been for a little while that Sam and Max, of course, again, we mentioned GameTap earlier.
2686000	2687000	It's kind of all coming together now.
2687000	2692000	The new Sam and Max adventures, I believe the most recent one was Episode 4, Abe Lincoln Must Die.
2692000	2696000	The rumor is that these Sam and Max games might be ported over to Xbox Live Arcade.
2696000	2700000	Now, Telltale Games finally said something this week about the whole thing.
2700000	2702000	They said they will, quote,
2702000	2705000	look closely at releasing a potential Sam and Max project.
2705000	2706000	Quote,
2706000	2714000	We can confirm that we are hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, although we do not have any official Xbox project announcements to share right now.
2714000	2718000	Well, I would think if they're hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, they've got something planned.
2718000	2721000	And what else would be better than a Sam and Max game?
2721000	2725000	I guess, granted, it doesn't have to be the same games that GameTap is getting,
2725000	2731000	but certainly bringing the Sam and Max series to Xbox Live Arcade, I'm sure Microsoft would be all over that.
2731000	2737000	Well, something that our listeners are all over week in and week out is DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
2737000	2742000	DarkSakura surfs the internet up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
2742000	2743000	I don't know what that meant.
2743000	2745000	Every week.
2745000	2747000	And she finds a website suitable to share with all of you.
2747000	2757000	We call it DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
2757000	2761000	My Website of the Week is a marvelously special one.
2761000	2765000	It is Marvel.com, which I've been spending a whole shitload of time on,
2765000	2769000	downloading, I'm actually mostly just downloading wallpaper.
2769000	2776000	But they have, I think it's cool, they actually have some of the, I'd say comics from like a few months ago,
2776000	2778000	uploaded so that you can read them.
2778000	2780000	They have links to the toys, the movie news.
2780000	2786000	There's blogs up there, podcasts, stuff for mobile.
2786000	2787000	It's actually pretty cool.
2787000	2790000	I've been pretty happy with it.
2790000	2792000	So I'd say check it out.
2792000	2798000	It's really fun for a commercial site.
2798000	2801000	All right.
2801000	2802000	What are you surprised?
2802000	2803000	No, I'm just, I'm reading chat.
2803000	2806000	I'm arguing with Black Wolf right now in chat.
2806000	2807000	Hey Rob, do your job.
2807000	2811000	Loki's friend is fighting me in chat right now.
2811000	2815000	Loki's one friend saying that it's going to be hard to fit Sam and Max on Xbox Live Arcade
2815000	2817000	because of the size limit.
2817000	2821000	And I said, well, they upped the size limit to 250 megabytes, remember?
2821000	2824000	And Black Wolf says, yes, they'd have to make it more though.
2824000	2830000	And Black Wolf says, I just don't want 360 people to get my Sam and Max heart game tab.
2830000	2831000	So that's sort of true.
2831000	2834000	You don't want people to have your Loki, and you don't want people to have your Sam and Max.
2834000	2838000	You are a very possessive individual, Mr. Bobby Black Wolf.
2838000	2840000	I'm nobody's person, so, eh.
2840000	2844000	By the way, Bobby does his own show, Sunday Nights on All Games Radio.
2844000	2849000	A lot of our live listeners kind of see it as a pre-show to Orange Lounge Radio in some ways.
2849000	2850000	No, just teasing.
2850000	2852000	Our shows complement each other very well.
2852000	2854000	Bobby also is a big fan of the music games.
2854000	2856000	You can check his show out at allgames.com.
2856000	2861000	And listen to him stalk Loki on his program.
2861000	2871000	Anyways, so apparently they've spotted a couple games on the Vice, or, I see VC and I think Vice City.
2871000	2879000	Virtual Console Servers, because I know you can still do that little hack with the web browsers to view what's on those.
2879000	2882000	But anyways, two games that have been spotted.
2882000	2888000	One of them being Elevator Action, which is pretty awesome, and then Tech Mobile.
2888000	2889000	No it's not.
2889000	2890000	Elevator Action sucks.
2890000	2892000	It's one of those games people remember.
2892000	2893000	No, I'm talking about Tech Mobile.
2893000	2894000	Oh, Tech Mobile's awesome.
2894000	2896000	Yeah, fuck Elevator Action.
2896000	2900000	Tech Mobile on the NES was awesome, but Tech Mobile on the arcade was not so awesome.
2900000	2905000	Because I have the Tech Mobile arcade game on some Tech Mobile collection I had on the Xbox randomly.
2905000	2909000	But Tech Mobile on the NES was pretty rad.
2909000	2910000	So I'm looking forward to seeing that.
2910000	2911000	That would be pretty cool.
2911000	2913000	Elevator Action, not so much.
2913000	2915000	Elevator Action was not that good.
2915000	2918000	It's just people remember it because, ooh, it's a game with elevators.
2918000	2919000	You don't see that a lot.
2919000	2920000	I really wish they would have new Rob.
2920000	2922000	Even though Keystone Capers was a long time before it.
2922000	2927000	They need a Rob the Robot that plugs into one of your Wii U remotes.
2927000	2930000	And then they need to release those games on there.
2930000	2931000	Because I think that would be funny.
2931000	2932000	Like a little miniature Rob the Robot.
2932000	2933000	They don't need it.
2933000	2934000	Yes they do.
2934000	2935000	Because I want Rob the Robot.
2935000	2936000	Why?
2936000	2937000	Rob the Robot.
2937000	2940000	For those two shit games they had for it.
2940000	2941000	I mean to re-release Rob the Robot.
2941000	2943000	They can make new games.
2943000	2946000	Do Rob 2.
2946000	2948000	How about Rob Roberts, the bot?
2948000	2949000	That'd be good.
2949000	2950000	No.
2950000	2951000	They need to bring back.
2951000	2955000	How about a Jamie bot where it just nags you to do things?
2955000	2956000	That would be a woman bot, okay?
2956000	2958000	Turn on your system.
2958000	2960000	Download this upgrade.
2960000	2961000	No.
2961000	2964000	I only called you once to ask you to turn on your aims.
2964000	2966000	I'm going to send you the fucking pre-show.
2966000	2968000	Do not be a bitch to Rob.
2968000	2969000	Turn on your AOL.
2969000	2976000	If you think that I'm going to download your updates for you, you're completely wrong.
2976000	2978000	I'm an independent woman.
2978000	2979000	I'll do what I want.
2979000	2983000	I'm shutting off in the middle of your game now.
2983000	2988000	Wow.
2988000	2989000	I love this show.
2989000	2991000	I really, really love this show.
2991000	2992000	My battle aura.
2992000	2995000	All your memes have been deleted.
2995000	2999000	I have a power level of over 4,000 now, Rob.
2999000	3000000	I love you, Jamie.
3000000	3002000	The hell you do.
3002000	3003000	And Jamie bot.
3003000	3004000	The hell you do.
3004000	3005000	You treat me like this.
3005000	3006000	Look.
3006000	3007000	Here.
3007000	3008000	Look.
3008000	3011000	Jamie, I got a story that'll make you happy because I know you love Zork and Leisure Suit
3011000	3012000	Larry.
3012000	3013000	Who doesn't love Leisure Suit?
3013000	3014000	No.
3014000	3015000	And King's Quest?
3015000	3018000	Actually, I never really played any of them except for the first Zork.
3018000	3021000	Can't you just play along?
3021000	3023000	Vodka.
3023000	3025000	I don't think Vodka was a game.
3025000	3026000	Okay.
3026000	3027000	How about the Indiana Jones games?
3027000	3028000	Vodka Cures PMS.
3028000	3029000	Maniac Mansion?
3029000	3030000	Yeah.
3030000	3031000	I love Maniac Mansion.
3031000	3032000	There we go.
3032000	3034000	Well, Maniac Mansion, I'm sure there'll be a mention of it at Adventure Con.
3034000	3036000	But news alert.
3036000	3042000	Adventure Con is an adventure game convention that's going to happen August 28th and 29th
3042000	3045000	at the Mirage Hotel right on the Vegas Strip.
3045000	3048000	It's going to be two days of adventure game nerdom.
3048000	3054000	There's actually going to be a Zork room because, basically, Adventure Con had started
3054000	3058000	out as a 30th birthday celebration for Zork.
3058000	3063000	And so they decided to – it kind of grew into this all-encompassing adventure game
3063000	3064000	thing.
3064000	3066000	I don't know how many times Andreo started about music games, but now we're all video
3066000	3067000	games because we did that.
3067000	3069000	So there you go.
3069000	3072000	That's kind of neat.
3072000	3074000	And this, by the way, this is the first Adventure Con.
3074000	3076000	So it started off being a Zork thing.
3076000	3079000	Now it's this whole big thing because they're actually going to have Al Lowe from Sierra
3079000	3083000	there, Jane Jensen, the creator of the Gabriel Knights games.
3083000	3084000	It's pretty rad.
3084000	3088000	I did not realize that Zork 1 was written in 1977.
3088000	3094000	The White House with the mailbox here seems so, so long ago.
3094000	3095000	Hey, Rob?
3095000	3096000	What?
3096000	3098000	I just unleashed a grue in your underwear.
3098000	3100000	Thank you.
3100000	3102000	It's squishy.
3102000	3109000	Anyway, moving on for some different news.
3109000	3114000	The games for Windows Live beta sign-up is now open.
3114000	3121000	It's the Microsoft PC version of Xbox Live, and the two are going to be tied together
3121000	3123000	for cross-platform play.
3123000	3131000	So go check it out if you are not blessed enough to console game with the rest of us
3131000	3134000	cool kids.
3134000	3140000	And I will not be checking this out because I do not have Vista.
3140000	3142000	I do not want Vista.
3142000	3143000	Nor do I want to play PC.
3143000	3145000	Do not want.
3145000	3150000	But, what's kind of cool though, everyone remembers Wii-Cade.
3150000	3152000	Wait, I have to say this real fast.
3152000	3154000	You know why I don't want Windows Vista?
3154000	3158000	Because I do not want my computer to look like those god-awful Heroes previews that
3158000	3160000	were brought to us by Windows Vista.
3160000	3161000	Oh, I pissed off.
3161000	3163000	That turned me off to Windows Vista.
3163000	3165000	I was like, what have you done to my Heroes?
3165000	3168000	Do not want.
3168000	3170000	And it's simulated Vista.
3170000	3172000	Your offering has not pleased Kitty.
3172000	3176000	More.
3176000	3179000	No more.
3179000	3181000	Do not want.
3181000	3185000	So, Wii-Cade, Flashlight that has games made for the Wii browser.
3185000	3191000	Well, they have just opened up a downloadable API that will allow developers of other Flash
3191000	3196000	games to use the Wii Remote's buttons for actual gameplay.
3196000	3201000	Before, it used to be limited to kind of mouse games that use only the A button for clicking
3201000	3203000	and stuff like that.
3203000	3207000	But now they've actually figured out how to use every single button on the Wii Remote,
3207000	3209000	which is pretty fucking awesome.
3209000	3212000	So, hopefully we'll see some pretty cool games come from this.
3212000	3217000	And hopefully I will actually work on OLRWii.com at some point.
3217000	3220000	Yeah, you had to do that because there was some website I saw that had all these popular
3220000	3223000	Wii game things listed or something.
3223000	3228000	And I did not see OLRWii.com and I remembered, oh yeah, there's nothing on it.
3228000	3230000	Sorry.
3230000	3231000	Crackdown.
3231000	3232000	It's been a problem.
3232000	3236000	By the way, going back to the last story, it was commented in our chat room,
3236000	3238000	Loki does not have friends on Vista.
3238000	3241000	Where's Black Wolf now, Loki?
3241000	3244000	Black Wolf even made that comment, so you got no friends now.
3244000	3246000	I don't have Vista.
3246000	3247000	Oh no.
3247000	3248000	It's a joke.
3248000	3250000	Well, here's the thing though.
3250000	3254000	Windows Live, you remember, is part of the Live Anywhere, so technically I have a lot
3254000	3263000	more games for Windows Live than I do for actual the PS3 network.
3263000	3271000	So, ha, I do have friends on there and I don't even have it.
3271000	3275000	Something that you can't play with friends, although I think it would be fun if you could.
3275000	3276000	It's a SimCity DS.
3276000	3279000	Actually, I don't know much about this.
3279000	3281000	Perhaps maybe you can play with friends.
3281000	3283000	Oh, there is wireless data exchange in this game.
3283000	3284000	You can't play with friends.
3284000	3286000	SimCity DS.
3286000	3291000	It has officially been announced that it will be coming to the US.
3291000	3292000	Yay.
3292000	3294000	Other things that SimCity DS allows you to do.
3294000	3297000	You can blow out fires by blowing on the DS's microphone.
3297000	3300000	Doesn't that actually keep fires going?
3300000	3301000	Ah, forget it.
3301000	3304000	You sign off proclamations using the stylus.
3304000	3306000	That's fun.
3306000	3308000	So, there you have it.
3308000	3310000	That will be coming out in June, by the way.
3310000	3315000	That's a nice little translation time between Japan and the US there.
3315000	3318000	Because I believe this game just came out in Japan like last week.
3318000	3325000	I have to admit I'm not as excited about this game because it's based off the SimCity 2000 engine.
3325000	3327000	And I didn't like SimCity when it went 3D.
3327000	3331000	It was too much for my feeble brain to handle.
3331000	3333000	Bring me my old school 2D SimCity.
3333000	3339000	I actually have it on Virtual Console and I never play it because I get sucked into other games.
3339000	3342000	Like World of Warcraft.
3342000	3346000	Well, you know, that's just because you're an addict, Rob.
3346000	3348000	How about a different game?
3348000	3350000	How about Darwinia?
3350000	3357000	Darwinia, as announced by Introversion, is going to be multiplayer in 2008.
3357000	3359000	Excuse me.
3359000	3362000	It's set for release on its own.
3362000	3369000	It's called Multi-Winia. We'll let you play cooperatively or competitively.
3369000	3375000	The number of people on, they're not really sure how much they're going to be able to handle.
3375000	3384000	But they're hoping that they're going to go really, really massive.
3384000	3389000	I'm going to reserve judgment for actually seeing it.
3389000	3402000	They're saying that there's a quote by John Nottenbelt saying that it will let you organize your Darwinians into ranks and create massive armies.
3402000	3404000	So that would be kind of cool.
3404000	3407000	I don't know. I'm still going to reserve judgment for actually seeing it.
3407000	3410000	Is that a free game? I can't remember. Was Darwinia a free one?
3410000	3414000	I believe it was. I thought about playing it.
3414000	3421000	The chat, I'm sure, knows because I believe some folks ought to know what's going on there.
3421000	3424000	Let me see if anybody in chat can answer my question there.
3424000	3426000	Oh, they say no it wasn't.
3426000	3429000	I think you could download a demo for free is what it was.
3429000	3433000	Hitstun says Darwinia had a demo but the game was $20.
3433000	3435000	I was going to see if it was something I wanted to check out.
3435000	3438000	I'll check out the demo because I'm kind of curious.
3438000	3447000	By the way, I'm very proud of Miklotov because he's been unlocking achievements in Crackdown for me while this show's been going on.
3447000	3451000	So he got me this First Blood achievement, which I didn't have, and Bare Knuckle Brawler.
3451000	3455000	Kill 150 gang members with your bare hands. Nice.
3455000	3460000	So if you wondered how I was on Xbox Live during the show, it's actually Miklotov playing Crackdown right now.
3460000	3462000	Awesome.
3462000	3465000	But I have more achievements than you do at Crackdown.
3465000	3468000	Alrighty. Yeah, you have a shitload of achievements in Crackdown.
3468000	3470000	I have more achievements than you do in Universe.
3470000	3474000	Oh God, I can't believe I didn't mention this at the top of the show.
3474000	3476000	That's alright. Nobody gets to the end of the show.
3476000	3480000	Do you know who I got a message from on Xbox Live while I was playing DDR Universe?
3480000	3481000	No.
3481000	3484000	Strip Club DJ. Do you know who that person is?
3484000	3485000	Yes.
3485000	3490000	He is like the guy who was, for a long time, he was the number one gamer points holder on all of Xbox Live, right?
3490000	3493000	He has over 100,000 gamer score.
3493000	3495000	I got a message from him, and it said simply,
3495000	3499000	Can you use the joystick on DDR?
3499000	3503000	Because I think he's probably contemplating, do I want to get DDR to get the 1,000 achievement points out of?
3503000	3506000	So I replied. I replied with a voice message though.
3506000	3511000	But I said something like, yes you can, but obviously you're supposed to use the dance pad,
3511000	3515000	but if you're just trying to run through the game, you'll probably just want to use the controller.
3515000	3519000	But I said something about quest mode sucking, and a lot of the unlocks coming through that.
3519000	3526000	Yeah, see I was stupid and I told somebody there was like 75 unlocks because in quest mode it says 0 of 75 for music stuff.
3526000	3530000	That's how much you own, or how many songs you own in quest mode, right?
3530000	3531000	That's what it is.
3531000	3536000	When you buy a song in quest mode to have the advantage in quest mode, that's...
3536000	3538000	See, the game doesn't fucking explain any of this.
3538000	3539000	That's why quest mode sucks.
3539000	3540000	I didn't even know what the hell that meant.
3540000	3542000	That's what it means.
3542000	3546000	So there you go.
3546000	3551000	But that was kind of funny to get a message from him because I guess apparently at one point,
3551000	3555000	and I looked at my gamercard.net right after that because that's the one that ranks,
3555000	3560000	I was apparently like number six or seven in the world for gamer score earned in DDR universe.
3560000	3561000	Really?
3561000	3564000	Yeah, because I ran through the game and played all the songs.
3564000	3569000	I got like 400 achievement points and then I just ran through a lot of the game real fast.
3569000	3571000	I'm sure I'm not up there anymore when you look.
3571000	3575000	I gotta just play through it. I can probably get way up there.
3575000	3577000	I think it's getting harder and harder now.
3577000	3579000	I doubt I'm even in the top 25 at this point.
3579000	3581000	Now you got me all curious. I'm gonna look.
3581000	3583000	See, am I even up there now?
3583000	3585000	Oh wow, I'm still number 17.
3585000	3586000	Look at that. There I am.
3586000	3587000	Does anyone have all of them?
3587000	3591000	Somebody has 900 points, 900 of the points, and somebody else has 860.
3591000	3594000	But nobody has all 1,000 yet.
3594000	3596000	I only have 480 points in the game.
3596000	3597000	It's not that hard to...
3597000	3600000	I mean, I could probably, if I really just sat down and played it,
3600000	3604000	I could probably crank out the whole game in one day.
3604000	3607000	I may think achievement points are fun and all,
3607000	3609000	and they kind of add something to the game,
3609000	3613000	but I would not consider myself an achievement point whore, so to speak.
3613000	3617000	So it was kind of just interesting that I did show up on there
3617000	3619000	and got contacted by Strip Club DJ.
3619000	3623000	A true achievement points whore because of it, so interesting.
3623000	3626000	Anyhow, we're gonna open up the Skype line.
3626000	3629000	If you want to give us a call and interact with our program, you can do so.
3629000	3632000	The number is 1-877-GAME-OLR,
3632000	3635000	or you can always use Skype to give us a call.
3635000	3637000	Our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.
3637000	3642000	If you want more information on that, you can visit www.orangeloungeradio.com
3642000	3644000	and click on Interact With Us,
3644000	3647000	and we'll wait for some calls to start coming in.
3647000	3650000	While we wait for something to come in, does anybody have a last-minute story?
3650000	3651000	Yep.
3651000	3652000	What do you want, Jamie?
3652000	3654000	Well, Lucky had one first, right?
3654000	3655000	Just real quick.
3655000	3657000	Just one story for now, and then we'll get to some other calls.
3657000	3658000	Just real quick.
3658000	3662000	In God of War 2, someone had gotten the game out before it's come out,
3662000	3667000	and on the back of the manual, it says God of War PSP coming in 2007.
3667000	3670000	So confirm it is coming on the PSP.
3670000	3671000	All right, there you have it.
3671000	3673000	Now we can go to the phones.
3673000	3674000	Well, wait.
3674000	3675000	We'll get more last-minute stories in a minute.
3675000	3676000	No problem.
3676000	3677000	Hi, you're on Renaissance Radio.
3677000	3678000	Who's this?
3678000	3679000	Legend of Zaku.
3679000	3680000	Hi, Legend of Zaku.
3680000	3682000	What's on your mind, buddy?
3682000	3689000	I already know about, you know, that Gold test is going to be released tomorrow for the location test, right?
3689000	3693000	I think you said, because you're dropping out there on the stream a little bit,
3693000	3696000	you said something about 2DX Gold coming out tomorrow for a location test.
3696000	3698000	Yeah, we mentioned that on last week's show.
3698000	3699000	Why?
3699000	3705000	No, I mean, they're all saying that, you know, from what I'm hearing right now is that,
3705000	3710000	you know, it has to do really good in order for it to actually move any further.
3710000	3713000	It's like a one-shot deal at the moment right now.
3713000	3715000	Well, but wait a minute, though.
3715000	3718000	I mean, what about those arcades that import Japanese games anyway,
3718000	3723000	like Arcade Infinity and whatever that one is on the East Coast that was...
3723000	3729000	But it changes on that single location test happening tomorrow and for the next two weeks.
3729000	3733000	So this is the one that might tip the scale.
3733000	3735000	Well, what city is it in again?
3735000	3736000	It's somewhere in Illinois, right?
3736000	3737000	Naperville.
3737000	3738000	Naperville?
3738000	3739000	Yeah.
3739000	3740000	In Illinois?
3740000	3744000	Yeah, it's near Betzen's locations nearby in Chicago.
3744000	3745000	All right.
3745000	3751000	Well, if you are in the Chicago Naperville area and you are a music video game fan
3751000	3755000	and you want to see BeatMania make a U.S. debut in arcades, you've got to go.
3755000	3756000	You've got to help out.
3756000	3758000	If you want to see it out, go through.
3758000	3759000	Come through on it.
3759000	3760000	All right.
3760000	3762000	Well, thank you for the reminder, Mr. Zaku.
3762000	3763000	I unfortunately cannot attend.
3763000	3764000	Chicago's a little far.
3764000	3766000	It's several thousand miles.
3766000	3770000	I know there's listeners probably in Illinois hearing this right now.
3770000	3771000	That's very true.
3771000	3774000	We do have the luxury of being not too far from L.A.
3774000	3778000	where we can drive for six hours to play 2DX Gold whenever they get it.
3778000	3780000	If they don't already have it, I don't even know.
3780000	3782000	I haven't actually followed BeatMania in a while, sadly.
3782000	3783000	Right.
3783000	3784000	All right.
3784000	3786000	Well, anything else, Zaku?
3786000	3794000	Just Sony's rumbling about why they didn't bother to settle quickly with immersion
3794000	3798000	rather than just wait until they drop the PS3.
3798000	3799000	Pride.
3799000	3805000	Pride is more like they were banking on a sinking ship called their lawsuit.
3805000	3809000	Well, remember that Rumble is so last gen.
3809000	3813000	Well, they're spinning and they're in denial.
3813000	3814000	It's like a little kid.
3814000	3820000	They know they fucked up, and so they're just like they don't want to admit it.
3820000	3822000	They don't want to admit they fucked up badly.
3822000	3827000	And that's why PS3 is not even worth getting right now, not even for another year.
3827000	3828000	All right.
3828000	3835000	Well, Zaku, thank you very much for the call, and good luck with your 2DX Gold promotion.
3835000	3836000	All right.
3836000	3837000	Thank you.
3837000	3838000	All right.
3838000	3839000	Let's go to another phone call.
3839000	3840000	Hi.
3840000	3841000	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3841000	3842000	Who's this?
3842000	3843000	Hey.
3843000	3844000	What's up, guys?
3844000	3845000	It's the Rob D.
3845000	3847000	Hi, Rob D. Are you still bitter about your loss from last week?
3847000	3848000	Not so much.
3848000	3849000	All right.
3849000	3850000	I'm just giving you a hard time.
3850000	3851000	Lucky did a good job on that.
3851000	3852000	Very good sport about the whole thing.
3852000	3853000	What's on your mind, buddy?
3853000	3854000	Not too much.
3854000	3859000	Just wondering what you guys thought about the news about the 20-gigabyte PS3 being possibly
3859000	3860000	discontinued.
3860000	3861000	I don't know if you heard about that.
3861000	3862000	Kind of.
3862000	3865000	We actually did cover it in part A. I don't know if Bobby's show ran long tonight or what.
3865000	3866000	No, I suck then.
3866000	3867000	It's okay.
3867000	3870000	I've actually been busy recording some stuff, but that's a different story altogether.
3870000	3871000	That's all right.
3871000	3872000	We'll forgive you.
3872000	3879000	You know, the 20-gig model, I mean, it was not something I was interested in anyway,
3879000	3882000	so I'm a little bit, you know, kind of about the whole thing anyway.
3882000	3887000	I think, to be honest, the 20-gig model is just as good as the 60-gig as far as what's
3887000	3888000	available for it.
3888000	3892000	I mean, if I were to buy one, I would pick the 20-gig.
3892000	3894000	I have a 20-gig, and it's great.
3894000	3898000	I mean, it's not like I have to worry about filling up with downloads because there's
3898000	3899000	nothing to download on it.
3899000	3903000	Well, isn't the 60-gigabyte version supposed to have dual HDMI ports?
3903000	3904000	Oh, wait.
3904000	3905000	No, it doesn't.
3905000	3909000	And then all models do have HDMI access.
3909000	3911000	No, I'm kidding.
3911000	3913000	That's what they said to E3.
3913000	3914000	But, yeah.
3914000	3915000	Other than that, that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about.
3915000	3916000	All right.
3916000	3919000	Well, thank you very much for the call, Rob D. We appreciate it.
3919000	3921000	Thank you for taking my call.
3921000	3922000	See you guys later.
3922000	3923000	No problem.
3923000	3924000	Have a good week.
3924000	3925000	Bye.
3925000	3926000	All right.
3926000	3927000	Bye.
3927000	3928000	All right.
3928000	3933000	If you want to give a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you got to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
3933000	3937000	Dark Soccer, why don't you throw us your last-minute story while we're waiting for a call.
3937000	3942000	Well, it was actually something posted by Tigerclaw in the chat room during the break
3942000	3948000	was Activision released a screenshot from the new Transformers game that they're putting
3948000	3949000	out.
3949000	3953000	Yeah, it makes my heart break.
3953000	3954000	I'm not going to like the movie.
3954000	3955000	I don't think.
3955000	3957000	It doesn't look like Transformers.
3957000	3962000	And the game makes my heart hurt.
3962000	3964000	What's so bad about it?
3964000	3966000	What isn't so bad about it?
3966000	3967000	Oh, my God.
3967000	3968000	Did you see it?
3968000	3969000	No.
3969000	3970000	What does it look like?
3970000	3972000	It's fucking awesome is what it is.
3972000	3973000	The fuck it is?
3973000	3974000	That does not look like Bumblebee.
3974000	3978000	It looks like a bee's head and like junk.
3978000	3980000	I can't wait to see this movie.
3980000	3981000	It's going to be awesome.
3981000	3982000	Look.
3982000	3983000	I know.
3983000	3984000	It's awesome.
3984000	3989000	I mean, I'll go see it because I have to, but God, it's fucking ugly.
3989000	3990000	All right.
3990000	3994000	Well, let's go to another call here on the Skype line and see what you folks have to
3994000	3995000	say.
3995000	3996000	Hi.
3996000	3997000	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
3997000	3998000	Who's this?
3998000	3999000	Whoa.
3999000	4000000	Can you guys hear me?
4000000	4001000	Hi.
4001000	4002000	Yes.
4002000	4003000	We can hear you.
4003000	4004000	What's up?
4004000	4005000	Hey.
4005000	4006000	This is DDR Dollar Bill.
4006000	4007000	Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.
4007000	4008000	What's on your mind?
4008000	4009000	Nothing much.
4009000	4010000	I got a Wii for Valentine's Day.
4010000	4011000	Oh, wheelie.
4011000	4012000	Yes, wheelie.
4012000	4015000	It's a nice little present, too, I figured.
4015000	4017000	What did you think?
4017000	4022000	Me and a girlfriend love it a lot.
4022000	4030000	We play mostly Wii Sports and Wii Play, and we also ended up getting into Metal Slug Anthology.
4030000	4040000	My big thing was that, did somebody in the show say that Metal Slug Anthology stunk?
4040000	4041000	No.
4041000	4043000	It's awesome.
4043000	4045000	I haven't played Metal Gear Anthology.
4045000	4047000	I'm sorry.
4047000	4048000	Metal Slug Anthology.
4048000	4051880	I think what we said on the show is that Kropotkin and Hendrix reviewed it this week.
4051880	4056520	We were teasing the All Games thing because they play Kropotkin and Hendrix between our
4056520	4058080	show.
4058080	4059760	I don't know if they said it sucked.
4059760	4062280	I unfortunately did not get a chance to hear their show yet this week.
4062280	4063560	I don't think they did, though.
4063560	4064560	I think they liked it.
4064560	4065560	Yeah.
4065560	4070280	It's pretty much better than the other emulations that came out for the other systems because
4070280	4074480	in most other emulated versions, like the Xbox, for example, there were loading times
4074480	4076360	in between each level.
4076360	4077680	This one has none.
4077680	4083080	It just pretty much goes into the game and plays it straight through, so it's exactly
4083080	4085560	like the arcade.
4085560	4088560	Interesting.
4088560	4089880	What else on the Wii have you been playing?
4089880	4091800	So obviously Metal Slug Anthology.
4091800	4098920	I tried the Wii Sports and the Wii Play, and the Wii Play, it's alright.
4098920	4101560	It was just worth it for the other controller, you know?
4101560	4102560	Gotcha.
4102560	4106440	Yeah, but the Wii Sports is a blast.
4106440	4110960	What do you think the Wii's chances are against the 360 and the PlayStation 3?
4110960	4111960	You live...
4111960	4114160	Where was it that you live again?
4114160	4117760	New York, nearby where Rama lives.
4117760	4121000	What do you think, I thought for some reason you were in another country, what do you think
4121000	4126840	the chances are of the Wii doing against the 360 and the PS3 in the long run?
4126840	4132280	If they can get better games that just don't rely on the Wii controls, but rather makes
4132280	4137840	something like the original stuff and a good third party support, yeah, it's definitely
4137840	4143640	going to be allowed for a while, and not just thought of as a party system, you know?
4143640	4145660	Anything else you want to share with our listeners, my friend?
4145660	4146660	One question.
4146660	4147660	Yes.
4147660	4153680	What was the exact difference with Zelda on the GameCube and the Wii?
4153680	4158760	Everything is right-handed on the Wii and left-handed on the GameCube.
4158760	4162360	So they have the same graphics and music and all that?
4162360	4163360	Actually, no.
4163360	4165640	The GameCube does not support the 16 by 9.
4165640	4166640	Gotcha.
4166640	4170080	Everything will be in the square as well, and that's why the graphics suffer a little
4170080	4171080	bit.
4171080	4172080	Oh, okay.
4172080	4174080	So, there you go.
4174080	4175080	All right.
4175080	4178240	All right, well thank you so much for the call, buddy, and enjoy the Wii.
4178240	4179960	Thanks, see you guys.
4179960	4180960	Later.
4180960	4182960	All right, we'll try at least one more call here on the Skype line.
4182960	4187040	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
4187040	4188680	It's deep breathing.
4188680	4189680	Sorry.
4189680	4190680	It's me.
4190680	4191680	It's you.
4191680	4192680	I thought it was an erotic phone call.
4192680	4193680	Who's this?
4193680	4194680	This is Youni.
4194680	4195680	Hi, Youni.
4195680	4196840	What's on your mind, buddy?
4196840	4199560	I was wondering about something.
4199560	4204040	I was thinking about getting a PS3, but you know how crappy they are?
4204040	4206400	Yeah, yeah.
4206400	4208080	What might be swaying your mind on this?
4208080	4215740	Well, I do play a lot of PS2 games on my PS2 and everything.
4215740	4221880	I don't know why I would want to buy one other than it enhances the graphics on your PS2
4221880	4222880	games.
4222880	4229040	And even for a while, it was de-hancing them, if you might have seen anything a while back.
4229040	4232320	It's like, why should you buy one?
4232320	4238680	Because they're like a 300 or 400, maybe 500 piece of crap, really.
4238680	4244680	I'm just thinking about what I should buy, because I'm not really sure yet.
4244680	4248760	I don't think the PlayStation 3 is worth it at the time.
4248760	4251800	Again, you've got to remember the golden rule of gaming here at Orange Launch Radio.
4251800	4257600	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
4257600	4260560	So it's really about what type of games you want to play.
4260560	4266840	I mean, if first person shooters are your thing, oh my God, Xbox 360 all the way.
4266840	4271920	If you want something that's a little more lighthearted, fun type of games, the Wii is
4271920	4275040	very your active system type of game.
4275040	4278080	And then, of course, you've got the PlayStation 3, which doesn't have a lot right now.
4278080	4280960	It's thought that a little later on down the line, it's strengths will be role playing
4280960	4283000	games and so on, just like it was on PlayStation 2.
4283000	4285360	But right now, not a lot going for it.
4285360	4288920	And you've got Microsoft trying to step it up with what they were lacking with the Xbox
4288920	4290840	the first time around.
4290840	4296280	They're talking about bringing out another MMO from Square Enix called Final Fantasy
4296280	4297280	13.
4297280	4299160	I'm not really sure about it.
4299160	4304200	I mean, it might bring me back to Square Enix, but they're really sitting on their thumbs
4304200	4308460	most of the time when you're calling a GM on Final Fantasy 11.
4308460	4315080	I've been playing WoW, and when you call a GM, it's like that.
4315080	4318640	You get the call, they answer it, they really care about their customers.
4318640	4321840	Well, thank God Final Fantasy 13 is not online then.
4321840	4323680	Yeah, I agree.
4323680	4327280	I think WoW, to WoW's credit, they probably have a bigger budget because they have like
4327280	4328960	umpteen million subscribers.
4328960	4333560	They probably have people on the clock 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
4333560	4334560	That's true.
4334560	4336920	But Final Fantasy 13 versus is not going to be online.
4336920	4340160	I think it's going to be more of a Kingdom Hearts-ish game, but that sounds pretty hot
4340160	4341160	to me.
4341160	4342160	Yeah.
4342160	4346440	Final Fantasy 13 probably will be the game that gets me on PlayStation.
4346440	4353400	I also heard that Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories is coming to the PS2.
4353400	4354600	I saw the trailer for it.
4354600	4357240	There's a big trailer report on YouTube.
4357240	4361840	It's completely redone, full style for the Kingdom Hearts games.
4361840	4366160	It's really, really awesome looking.
4366160	4369860	If I can remember where to find it, I should see if I can't repost the YouTube link.
4369860	4372120	I'm very curious to check this out myself.
4372120	4373680	It is freaking awesome.
4373680	4375360	You should check it out.
4375360	4376360	It better be.
4376360	4377360	All right.
4377360	4379800	Because if I'm rebuying Kingdom Hearts 2 for it, it better be.
4379800	4380800	All right.
4380800	4384760	Well, UNI, thanks so much for the call, and take care, and good luck on your system hunting.
4384760	4385760	You too.
4385760	4386760	Thank you.
4386760	4387760	Thank you.
4387760	4388760	All right.
4388760	4389760	Let's see if we get any more calls.
4389760	4390760	Ring, ring, ring.
4390760	4391760	Oh.
4391760	4392760	Well, that must be on the back line.
4392760	4393760	Hi.
4393760	4394760	Who's this?
4394760	4395760	This is Shane.
4395760	4396760	Oh, hi.
4396760	4397760	Oh, hey.
4397760	4398760	Shane's standing right in front of me.
4398760	4399760	Hi, Shane.
4399760	4400760	Hi.
4400760	4401760	AKA Miklatov.
4401760	4402760	That's what I am this week.
4402760	4403760	We can't call you Miklatov anymore.
4403760	4405840	Well, I had to change it because I'm trying to get into a pump group, and there was already
4405840	4409920	a Miklatov in pump, so I have to go by my more recent nickname of Arx.
4409920	4411200	Well, whatever the hell your name is.
4411200	4412200	That's why I just go by Shane.
4412200	4413200	All right.
4413200	4414200	Then what do you want?
4414200	4415200	Crackdown's the best game ever.
4415200	4416200	I love it.
4416200	4417200	It's in my mind.
4417200	4418200	Yeah.
4418200	4419200	I saw you unlock some achievements for me.
4419200	4420200	I appreciate that.
4420200	4421200	Heck, yeah.
4421200	4422200	It's so much fun kicking them.
4422200	4423200	What?
4423200	4424200	I wasn't really getting into it.
4424200	4425200	What really do you love about this game?
4425200	4430840	You can jump really high, and you jump across rooftops, and you're like the Tick, that superhero.
4430840	4433400	Was it just because I hadn't leveled up enough that I couldn't do it?
4433400	4434400	No.
4434400	4437080	I think you just didn't understand what you were doing, and...
4437080	4438080	You're right.
4438080	4439080	I didn't.
4439080	4443200	You're supposed to go and shoot people and kick them and jump from roof to roof, and
4443200	4445560	it's so much fun, and I really want it.
4445560	4446560	All right.
4446560	4449440	Well, you can't have my copy because now that you've told me it's fun, I need to go back
4449440	4450440	and play it more.
4450440	4451440	It's a terrible game.
4451440	4452440	Lies.
4452440	4453440	Yeah.
4453440	4454440	Lies.
4454440	4455440	You played Myst Online a little bit.
4455440	4456440	What'd you think of that?
4456440	4462400	I think I would like it a whole lot if it didn't have the worst controls I've ever touched.
4462400	4463400	It's really terrible.
4463400	4465040	But it's simple.
4465040	4466400	Simply hard.
4466400	4477120	Maybe if it had a game pad input thing I could use, but I can't use W-A-S-D, and it goes
4477120	4481640	back to that old Resident Evil style where up is always forward no matter which way you're
4481640	4486720	facing, and I don't dig that, and the mouse is awkward to use.
4486720	4490240	But I think I will probably give it another shot because it was really cool because I
4490240	4491840	like solving puzzle things.
4491840	4493320	All right.
4493320	4496680	And Crackdown is a great game.
4496680	4497680	It's so much fun.
4497680	4500840	I would say something more, but it's probably racist.
4500840	4502160	It is so funny.
4502160	4503560	Can I say it anyway?
4503560	4504560	I guess.
4504560	4512880	It's so much fun kicking the Mexicans in the head.
4512880	4515360	Orange Lounge Radio has just been banned from Mexico.
4515360	4516360	Look at that.
4516360	4517360	How do you like that?
4517360	4518520	That's the only part I'm at right now.
4518520	4522840	I'm sure once I beat that part I can go kick some other race, but Mexicans are so easy
4522840	4523840	to target.
4523840	4524840	All right.
4524840	4525840	There you go.
4525840	4526840	Click.
4526840	4529560	DDR dollar bill says holy racist remark.
4529560	4530560	My God.
4530560	4531560	Act Deafed.
4531560	4532560	Act Deafed is a Mexican.
4532560	4533560	Didn't like that comment.
4533560	4535520	Did not like that comment.
4535520	4541840	That's okay because I'm like a quarter Brazilian and that's all I know, so I'm dirty too.
4541840	4549880	You can send those cards and letters to Shane or Miklata or whatever the fuck your name
4549880	4554800	is this week at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4554800	4560320	Act Deafed says I'm a Mexican, but I agree with Miklata, so there you go.
4560320	4561320	The violence.
4561320	4562320	The violence.
4562320	4564960	I do not appreciate the violence.
4564960	4568160	Our phone lines are ringing off the hook and everyone's trying to get in.
4568160	4569160	All right.
4569160	4570160	One more call.
4570160	4571160	Hi.
4571160	4572160	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4572160	4573160	Who's this?
4573160	4574160	Hi.
4574160	4575160	This is Agent Otto.
4575160	4576160	Agent Otto.
4576160	4578040	I don't recognize your name.
4578040	4579040	What do you want, Agent Otto?
4579040	4580240	Are you a new listener?
4580240	4582200	Are you a new listener of Orange Lounge Radio?
4582200	4583600	I'm from Elevator Action.
4583600	4584600	Oh.
4584600	4585600	Oh, God.
4585600	4586600	Oh, yes.
4586600	4590200	Elevator Action, that horribly overrated game from the 1980s.
4590200	4591600	How are you, Agent Otto?
4591600	4592600	I'm doing great.
4592600	4596000	I don't know what your problem is with my game and what I do for a living.
4596000	4600600	I go into buildings, find documents, and not get shot in the head and not get crushed by
4600600	4601600	elevators.
4601600	4602600	Well, what do you do?
4602600	4604360	You sit there and talk about how bad my game is?
4604360	4607860	Well, Agent Otto, your game bored the shit out of me because it was pretty much the same
4607860	4611880	joke after the first two minutes for hours on end.
4611880	4614720	You know the game's actually hard, right?
4614720	4616720	Yes, it is pretty hard.
4616720	4618760	That's another reason why I don't play it.
4618760	4619760	Oh.
4619760	4623440	Well, then you probably didn't play anything from the 80s then because you clearly hate
4623440	4624440	hard games.
4624440	4626800	No, I actually played a lot of games from the 80s, like Crystal Castles.
4626800	4629500	Actually, I don't know if you listened to the program last week, but we had a whole
4629500	4633600	segment on 80s games that I'd played and beat the host.
4633600	4635840	I don't listen to your show.
4635840	4636840	I'm too busy going to...
4636840	4640560	How do you get the number to this program then, Agent Otto?
4640560	4645080	Because I'm at DMN's house drinking beer, and I heard you talking shit about me.
4645080	4646320	Why are you hanging out with DMN?
4646320	4648000	He sucks.
4648000	4649680	Because I have no one better to hang out with.
4649680	4650680	I see.
4650680	4655200	So, Agent Otto is DMN's only friend, just like Black Wolf is Loki's only friend.
4655200	4657280	Yeah, I know.
4657280	4658480	He's a pretty sad guy.
4658480	4664640	Well, then, much like I do to DMN, Agent Otto, I'm hanging up on you now.
4664640	4672360	Going to the chat room, let's see.
4672360	4675240	Sky Warrior says DMN is not funny.
4675240	4677520	Alpha Catagram says DMN sucks.
4677520	4684760	You can hear DMN here on Orange Lounge Radio on Thursday nights on STFU, if you want to
4684760	4685760	hear that.
4685760	4686760	Uni says DMN is not funny.
4686760	4688760	Aw, poor DMN.
4688760	4690760	Poor baby.
4690760	4694960	Alright, sorry to those folks we didn't get to, but we got to get the show wrapped up
4694960	4698560	because it's already like 20 minutes after 9, we're running a little long tonight, and
4698560	4700320	we'd like to go home at a decent hour tonight.
4700320	4705120	So if there's any more last minute stories, now's a good time to get them out?
4705120	4706120	Nope.
4706120	4707120	Loki?
4707120	4708120	Nope.
4708120	4709680	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
4709680	4712240	Loki, your final thought?
4712240	4714760	I need to finish Crackdown.
4714760	4716280	Dark Soccer, your final thought?
4716280	4719600	I need to play more Captain America.
4719600	4725680	My final thought is Pants!
