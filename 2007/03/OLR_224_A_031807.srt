00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, March 18th, 2007

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
All next-gen systems are set to roll up

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A beautiful Katamari

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Halo 3 is set to arrive in September

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But on what day?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And what happens when two popular dance games get together and have a baby?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello everyone out there on the internet

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Video gaming, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yo

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And also joining us tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hi

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Alright, if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We'd like to welcome you to our little program

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
DarkSakura, Loki and I all met a few years ago at an arcade

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And decided, hey let's start a radio show talking about games

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And we've been doing this internet program for the past almost five years

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It'll be five years in June

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Talking about for a while music-based video games

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And a couple years ago expanding into podcasting

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And talking about a general variety of games

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We're going to deviate from our usual forum a little bit

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Usually we start off the show talking about how is your gaming week

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But tonight, we want to get right into this

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Because we think this might be possibly what might draw some new people to our site this week

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Is this particular story

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to cite a particular story of this site

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
QJ.net ran this story

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So let's take a look, shall we?

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Rumor, release dates for beautiful Katamari for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Before we go any further, we'll take this moment to warn everyone

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That this particular topic is currently marked with a huge red rumor flag

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is a report about something that has somehow made the internet implode

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But until we get any official word from Namco Bandai about the whole issue

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We suggest taking the following details with a grain of salt

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, good

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Blah, blah, blah, there's reports going around about beautiful Katamari

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Blah, blah, blah, it's going to come out on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
October 17, 2007 for $39.99

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
On the Wii, November 14, 2007 for $29.99

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The report goes on to say that the PlayStation 3 version will feature 6-axis support

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Though fails to elaborate on how exactly this will be implemented

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And also points out that the release dates they gave actually coincide with a trademark

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Namco Bandai filed back in January

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A screenshot has said trademark has been provided as proof

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now as much as we want to start doing cartwheels of joy over this piece of news

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There are several things we need to keep in mind

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
At the moment, the only source of these reports seem to be Orange Lounge Radio

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Who are they? I've never heard of them

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There's this really annoying guy and then this other really annoying guy and then this really awesome girl on it

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A bunch of liars is who they are, they're a bunch of damn dirty liars

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Although they must have some pretty solid reasons on how they came up with this bit of news

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Skeptics can say that there are still some gaps that need to be filled in

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We all have yet to receive official word from Namco Bandai

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Which either confirms or denies the existence of beautiful Katamari

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Trademarks get filed almost every day

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But that doesn't necessarily mean that they actually get used

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't know, they're really poking some holes in this theory here

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is something else

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The team behind Katamari has already been disbanded

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And as far as everyone knows, no sequels were planned

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Although Katamari trademarks were registered towards the end of 2006

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well we just so happen to have the man who started this whole thing right here in studio tonight

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Loki, you goddamn liar

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is this some type of April Fools joke you're playing on all of us?

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Is that what it is?

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Tell me Knights is coming to the Wii? What the hell?

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's not my story

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alright, no

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Seriously though, it wasn't just Katamari

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In fact, we have the whole lineup for Namco

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Which we'll be revealing a little later in the show

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So it's not just Katamari

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I got excited by Katamari because I love the game

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So I figured, share the story with everyone

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That and I gotta get a jump on those big corporate sites

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Because, you know, they like to beat everybody to stuff

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Anyways, so

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Beautiful Katamari

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It is set for this fall

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Are set for October 17th

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
$39.99, which is great

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You know, nice price point for a game like that

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And if you remember, the original Katamari

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Also very inexpensive

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And then of course the Wii version is coming in November

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And that's also $29.99

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Now, we do have a big time span between now and the fall

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So, I can confirm this much

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, the game is coming out

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That is for sure

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Whether Namco decides to release it on those exact dates

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Because, you know, dates change a lot

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You know, especially with six months gaps in between them

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I would say that yeah, it's gonna come around the fall for sure

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Those exact dates, who knows

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But those are street dates, not ship dates

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Ship dates are a day before

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Because, you know, most retailers out there

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And most distributors out there

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They work on street date systems

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
As opposed to ship dates

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
As, you know, most publishers work on

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's say that someone's listening to this show for the first time

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Because they want to hear what a bunch of liars we really are

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why should anyone believe you?

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Tell me, tell us

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How you got, tell us what happened Friday morning

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What took us from you finding out about this

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And how you found out about it too

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Posting it on the site and so on

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, I do a lot of work on order forms and stuff for my company

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm a, you know, I work at a game distributor

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
One of the big ones in the United States

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And so, because I work on this show as well

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And because I'm, you know, a huge freak

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
When it comes to making sure I have accurate dates

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And all my, you know, order forms and stuff

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I check our system for new stuff

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Almost twice daily, if not more

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Because I'm crazy like that

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And so, I will look and see if there's new stuff

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Especially next gen stuff all the time

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And when I saw, you know

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Actually, I think the first title I did see was

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ace Combat 6

137
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Which we'll be talking about later

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I saw that and the system was like

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hey, that's kind of neat, new game

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So I, you know, said

141
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, well probably got some Namco title downloads

142
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And sure enough, pulled up

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh, there's Katamari

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So I was like, okay, I gotta let people know this

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Because I was literally like jumping up and down in my seat

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You know, when I saw this

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But anyways, as far as how I get these dates

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
These dates are actually straight from the publishers

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Usually their sales department, purchasing department

150
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Wherever you may call it

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Are they secret?

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you breaking an NDA by posting these?

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Can you get fired?

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Can we get sued?

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No, no, there's no

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is public information

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Any one of our, you know, customers

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Has access to this information

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm assuming that most of them probably

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't, you know, work in internet radio as well

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But at the same time, I mean, you see this stuff all the time

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Also on like, you know, GameStop or Amazon

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Or something like that

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
They get title downloads as well

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Sometimes, you know, GameStop and stuff like that

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
They'll put in arbitrary, you know, titles or dates

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Or whatever, you know, for preorders

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But since we don't really work on a preorder system

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We don't have anything like that

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We pretty much, if they give us, you know, the information

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
To set up an item

172
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We will set it up in our system

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And with whatever information they give us

174
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Well, interestingly enough

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
One thing that we observed is that almost at the same time

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And I don't know who posted it first

177
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You, these guys, but this other site

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Xbox IC had some guy renegade with a cell phone camera

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
At a blockbuster who took screenshots in their system

180
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Also of Ace Combat and beautiful Katamari

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And so it was very weird because, you know, we don't talk to that site

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They don't talk to us

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But yet we posted almost very similar stories

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
At the exact same time

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's very interesting

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And if you look at their dates on there

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Their dates are all Friday dates

188
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Whereas ours are all Wednesday dates

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Wednesdays are typically when, you know, most companies get their games released

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Of course games come out every single day of the week

191
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But for the most part it's usually Wednesdays, Thursdays or Tuesdays

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Usually in the middle of the week

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Now blockbusters, they're one of two things

194
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They're either gonna, most likely they're gonna be

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Not direct with a publisher

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So for Blockbuster

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They would be getting their product received into the distributor

198
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Or their corporate office or wherever

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And shipped out to the store

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Usually about two days ground or whatnot

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's why they have Friday street dates in there instead of Wednesdays

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It just, you know, makes the system nice and neat and stuff

203
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So, yeah

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's basically how we come about most of our street, you know, street dates and stuff like that

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's from actual sources at these companies

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The problem is though their marketing departments

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And the sales departments don't always talk to each other

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And so in the case of like, you know, Konami last year

209
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
When we released all the information about their E3 lineup

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
They apparently didn't really want that information to be, you know, leaked out

211
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But unfortunately somebody in their sales department went and did that

212
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But, you know, that's life

213
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That was a very interesting thing

214
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because, you know, we have friends that work at Konami

215
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Several friends work at Konami

216
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And they almost got a little heat

217
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Because Konami thought they blapped

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And that isn't the case

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It was this whole roundabout thing that went on

220
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Which was very interesting last year when that all went down

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah

222
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Now you say that this news, you know, the dates could change

223
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The prices could change

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And a lot of websites who've been blocking about this

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Have been kind of saying that

226
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Wow, this is really ballsy of them to post some dates and some dollar amounts

227
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
When it's so far out of advance

228
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But you're kind of admitting that that could change

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If it changes, it won't be by much

230
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I mean, usually, you know, Namco as far as I'm familiar with

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
They don't really change dates too much

232
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
As far as stuff releasing

233
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You know, some companies, for example, some of the smaller ones

234
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You know, there's titles they'll move each month

235
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And, you know, we'll see a date change like six or seven times

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You know, some companies are a little bit better by that

237
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
When they put a street date in the system

238
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They'll actually stick to that

239
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You know, Rockstar with Grand Theft Auto IV

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's been October 17th since it's been announced

241
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But I think about Bethesda and Oblivion

242
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And that date always falls back

243
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, exactly

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And it can be, you know, a couple things

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
They can be trying to postpone it to a later date because it's not done

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Or because they want to time it with, you know, certain releases or lack of releases

247
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You know, it's really up to the company

248
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But I, you know, I don't really kind of

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If that were the case and if I was always afraid of dates changing

250
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Then I'd never be telling you guys news

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But the reason is you, I mean, even if the date changes

252
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's, you know, whatever

253
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But the fact is this game is coming out

254
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Next question I'm going to ask you

255
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, and I think of

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's think of some cases on this program where this was correct

257
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And you named games through the distribution system

258
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
People didn't have yet that ended up coming out

259
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We may not have blogged about them on the site

260
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Because we don't have the resources to have people

261
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Crawling blog sites 24 hours a day, 7 days a week

262
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And the distribution thing and the way the other sites do it

263
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We don't, we have day jobs

264
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We do this for fun in the evening, you know

265
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Like Logie said, his day job is distribution

266
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So we don't have the resources to blog about it

267
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And have it, you know, in writing that we were the first every time

268
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And the fact is sometimes, you know, like I said

269
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The marketing departments and sales departments of these companies

270
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't always work together

271
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Some of them do, like for example Nintendo

272
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They know not to say anything about anything

273
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And even when you feed them a lot of alcohol

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They still will not say anything

275
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But yet I seem to recall that you were the only one

276
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That was willing to say that the Wii was going to come out

277
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
After the PlayStation 3

278
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Because at some point earlier in the year

279
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Nintendo had said, no, we're going to beat the PlayStation 3

280
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And they didn't, remember the Wii came out a little bit later

281
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And you called that, I remember that distinctly

282
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Not that I'm trying to inflate our own ego here

283
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You know, it's not a big deal, honestly

284
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But it just, I don't know

285
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
For me, I get a little bit frustrated when I see all these website headlines

286
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And say, rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor

287
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yet when EB Games and GameStop will post dates

288
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They'll block it with, EB Games says this is going to come out

289
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And they don't say it's a rumor

290
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Why couldn't this have been blocked saying, distribution leak says, blah, blah, blah

291
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why does that have to be rumor, rumor, rumor?

292
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well it's because, you know, our website doesn't have the word game

293
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
In it or a company name like Nintendo or something like that

294
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And that's why

295
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
For example though, I mean, look at the Konami releases and stuff

296
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Or for example, I think someone, I can't remember if you did this or not in the story

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But the whole Wired article saying, Karaoke Revolution, American Idol

298
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
All these guys are a bunch of liars

299
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And this thing is never coming out

300
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And then it comes out

301
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Do we see, you know, a story run later?

302
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Oh, they were right, no

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Everybody forgets that we mentioned it

304
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And once, you know, a big site runs the press release

305
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Then everybody forgets that we even mentioned anything

306
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And this is how it's happened in the past

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean, full out of two on the PSP

308
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I kept seeing this weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks after each other

309
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But no one remembered when, you know, was it one up ran the fucking press release

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Or ran the story that's coming out

311
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I was like, oh look, it's coming out on the PSP now

312
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The other one I think of is Oblivion on the PSP

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because when you first said that on the show

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I was like, what? How the hell are they going to do Oblivion on the PSP?

315
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But sure enough, we find out later on

316
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
A scaled down dungeon only version

317
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And you know, sometimes they'll release press releases

318
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
About game announcements before sales will find out

319
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like I said, it all depends on, you know, what the marketing department wants to do

320
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And what the sales department wants to do

321
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The sales department wants to make sure that the retailers and distribution
