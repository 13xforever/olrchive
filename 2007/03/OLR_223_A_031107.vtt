Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Waroko

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, March 11th, 2007, as Sony won back some fans with the unveiling of PlayStation Home,

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
EA and Harmonix Forged Deal, and has an online poll foreseen the return of NiGHTS

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
We are that podcast dedicated to video games and the gamer culture and gamer lifestyle

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Hi

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
How are you doing?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
I has salad

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
You have a salad, a yummy salad?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
I has a salad

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
I has a fresh choice earlier today, it was good

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
I has Quiznos

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Do they have fresh choice all throughout the country?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I don't know, is that a local thing?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
No

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Basically it's an entire restaurant that's a giant salad bar

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
The only way you get salad bars is if you go to Shoney's

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Or Sizzler's

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
We don't have Sizzler's in Alabama

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I know what Shoney's is, but they don't have that here

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Shoney's is nasty

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Well so is Waffle House, yet it's still popular

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Waffle House is not nasty!

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Waffle House has special drugs that they put in the hash browns

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Anyway, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
A whole place dedicated to salad is nasty

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
What the fuck?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
They have pizza

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
It's a pita's dream, I mean seriously

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
They have pizza

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Or pita's dream, yeah

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
They have pizza and soup too

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Okay, well soup is okay

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Fucking, why the fuck is pizza there?

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
That's just so random

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I guess it's healthy pizza, I don't know

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Well I remember, god I went there a long ass time ago with an ex

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
And I had pasta there, pasta was okay, but salad is just nasty

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
They have the best bread ever though

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
That's what food eats, I don't eat that, I eat food

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
Alright, well let's get into tonight's program

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
First off actually I want to say, Techmaster Loki, did you notice

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
We did not get the FUs of the Week music automatically start playing

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
I was a good boy this week and made that not play

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
That's because he told you to

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
What?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
No, I thought of it all by myself

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Stupid Jamie revealing stupid behind the scenes stuff

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Alright anyhow, also I do want to plug the chat room

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
chat.orangelaunchradio.com

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
We have lots of boys and girls that come there to chat with us

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Kind of the fourth guest of our program

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
When we don't have any other regular fourth guest such as tonight

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
We don't really have a regular fourth guest, that kind of sucks

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I tried to get Dan to come

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Oh really?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
And his loud friends

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Probably for the best they didn't come then

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, they're playing some card game

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
We had a guest and then he left

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
When's Marissa coming back?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Maybe next week

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Sweet, how about Chris?

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Maybe next week

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Because I'm horribly broke

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
I have to have Chris and Marissa come up here for doing the birthday stuff

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I think that might be when Rice Princess and Eddie come here too

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
So we could get everybody in here in one week

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
You know what, we could just all leave

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Honestly, three of us could just take the night off, let them do the show

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
What do you say chat room?

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
Let Chris, Rice Princess, Marissa, and Eddie do the show instead of us

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
What do you say?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
We'll take the night off, we'll go out to eat

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Let's do that

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
We'll go to Country Waffles

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Our knockoff of Waffle House we have out here

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
No, we'll go to Fresh Choice

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
They closed at four

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
The entire chat room's at no, no, no

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And they're only open breakfast and lunch

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Oh damn it

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Oh, we got a hell yeah from Zappy, there you go, DDR dollar bill, hell fucking yes

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
They don't love us anymore is what it boils down to

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
That's sad

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Alright, well let's start off tonight's program the way we usually start it off

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
With a little bit of How Is Your Gaming Week

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Where we talk about the games we've been playing this week

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
If anything at all, Dark Sakura

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Marvel Ultimate Alliance

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
Still, huh?

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Yes, and then Dan had to take it back so he's just gonna buy it for me after Pay Day

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
The only freaking PS3 game I will play, like, regularly

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I love my PlayStation 3 now

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
It gives me Captain America and Wolverine

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
In the same game

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Although the damn thing is on the Wii and the 360 as well

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I don't care

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
360 get achievement points

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
That's true, the Wii you could do

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Flippy, floppy movie things

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You know what, I don't like doing that

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I do not like doing that

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
I have to say, as much as I love the Wii

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I think that when you have games

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
That are made for play like that

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
That's one thing, but when you have a fucking platformer

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I just fucking put a controller in my hand and let me play

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
One thing I actually don't like about the PS3 one

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Is that it has you flip the controller to pull

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I was gonna say the PlayStation 3 uses that six axis

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
But it's stupid

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Six axis, like a normal word

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
Because, you know, Sony wants that big marketing oomph behind the words

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Six axis

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
It sounds like an alien race from Doctor Who

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Kinda

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Exterminate

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
God damn it, Tigerclaw

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Why do you have to drive the knife in my heart?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
I'm assuming, I haven't even looked at chat

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm assuming Tigerclaw is talking about

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
How your Wednesday must have been

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
How did your Wednesday go?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I hate you Marvel

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
You bitches

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
In case for whatever reason this is your first week listening to Orange Launch Radio

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
You know, Sony is talking about our personal lives as well

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And one thing that Dark Soccer is also a fangirl of

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Is comics, namely

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Captain America

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Which is funny because really on this program

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
I know you've liked Captain America a long time

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
But it really seems like, especially in the past six weeks

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Your fandom seems to have rekindled

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Because I started reading all the Civil War comics

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
And I was like, dude, he's cool

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
But then, so it was kinda funny

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I mean, not like funny haha

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
But funny like, don't call Jamie today

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Like when I saw it in the news

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
That they'd killed off Captain America

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
So how was your day when that happened?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
He will be back

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
You think he'll be back?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Oh come on, it's a fucking

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
You know, Marvel needs money

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
So they do a gimmicky thing

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
So I was looking at your

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
All games community page today

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
And somebody decided to jab the knife through your heart

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
A little more there and say, going

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Basically somebody put a comment on Jamie's page and said like

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Haha, Captain America died

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
What do you say to those people that say

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Haha, Captain America died?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Die in a fire

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
That's what I thought

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Is there anything else in your week you want to talk about?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Um

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I really like my salad

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Salad the game

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
It's alright, we don't have to worry about Captain America dying

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Because Afghanistan is going to come and replace him

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
So

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Wow, that's a very unpolitically correct comment

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
And he's going to be far more awesome

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
My gaming week was filled with lots of stuff actually

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
I played quite a few different games

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Starting on the 360

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Of course played Crackdown

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
Because Crackdown is awesome

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I did play

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
What else did I play?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Oh, Armored Core 4

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Which is pretty cool

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
It's going a lot faster than

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
ChromeHounds

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Looking forward to that, I'm not sure if I want to pick it up yet

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Because I'm trying to cut back on the amount of games I buy

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
But it's still pretty cool

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
On the Playstation 3

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I downloaded Flow

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Tried that

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
It was pretty good, kind of relaxing I guess

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I didn't realize that there were actually

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Stages in the game

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
So it's kind of neat they get to become different things

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Including like a dolphin looking thing

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
So that's kind of neat

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And then I played Motorstorm

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Which Motorstorm is pretty awesome

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Graphically and it's pretty fun to play

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
My only gripe on it

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Split screen multiplayer for one

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
That would have been nice

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
The other thing is

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
The game looks so awesome

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And there's like some pretty cool

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Animation in the menus and stuff

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
But during races

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
The fucking spectators are cardboard cutouts

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
And they're not even animated cardboard cutouts

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
They're just like stuck in a pose

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
And I'm like

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I understand that you know you probably couldn't animate

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
All these people in the game

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Even though other games can do that

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You know

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
That's how I was in the Gran Turismo HD concept at E3 right?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Oh yeah and I still thought I was retarded there

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Huh

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Granted they're probably trying to save on

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
You know calculations and stuff

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
To make it run smoother but

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
The least you could do is make them animate

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
A little bit so I can kind of go

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Okay at least that doesn't look

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
As hokey you know

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
It's 2D but at least it's animating

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Or doing something you know cheering and stuff

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Why is it just a person standing there frozen

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
It just looks retarded that's something you would do

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
On like the fucking Super Nintendo

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Or something and even the fucking

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Super Nintendo had animated sprites

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
That were cheering in the background

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah but those little dudes aren't sprites anymore

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Sprites are so last gen

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Okay well it's still

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Something that's sitting there at 3D spaces

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
2D okay whatever

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
So they could have done that

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
That's my big gripe on that

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Otherwise the game's fun

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
You know I had a lot of fun playing it

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Speaking of last gen Alpha Canogram in chat says

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Loki split screen multiplayer is so

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Last gen

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh yeah it's so last gen that's why

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Halo 3 is gonna fucking have split screen multiplayer

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
That's why Call of Duty 3

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Has split screen multiplayer

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
That's why Gears of War has split screen multiplayer

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
So fuck off it's still

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
In town okay

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
No last gen it's because you can't

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Fucking program a game that can have multiple

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Instances of it running at the same time

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
So that's just lazy

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Programming which you know

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Oh I'm sure Motorstorm wasn't lazy

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Programming it wasn't like they downgraded from

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
1080p and 60 frames per second

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
To 720p and 30 frames per second

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Which I still say though

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
The game looks fun

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
And it looks pretty awesome

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Some other things that they probably didn't think about though

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
When you're playing in first person like say

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
In the cockpit type of thing

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
And it's not really in the cockpit

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
The camera's just on the front of the vehicle

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Which is still stupid

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
But if you happen to crash into something

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
And your hood gets bent

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
You could actually not be able to drive in that perspective

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Because it's blocking the whole camera

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Which totally makes sense

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
But anyways

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
So other than Playstation 3 stuff

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Let's see here

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
On the PSP I was playing of course

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Which is fun

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I also put some homebrew stuff on there

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Including this game called No Gravity

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Which I might say that this game right here

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
They could totally sell at retail

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
And it looks a lot better than most of the PSP games

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Out there

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And so the fact that most of those games out there

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
For the PSP are getting their asses kicked

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
By a homebrew game

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
That's pretty sad

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
A demo for a game looks way better

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Than a lot of stuff like Konami

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Capcom, whatever

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Put out on the PSP

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
It can be done

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
I just would like to see some more independent games come out there

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Maybe something like XNA

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Or something like that for the PSP

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Would be pretty awesome

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
But that's about it

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm about to load the Thrill Kill

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
And DDR Fifth Mix on my PSP

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
During the show

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Keep us posted on that

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
So you're not actually going to be participating in tonight's show?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Oh ok

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Do that in between

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Hitstun wants to know

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Does the retail MotorStorm crash every five minutes?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Nope

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Wasn't it determined that the crashing of MotorStorm

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Was the resetting of the system gone wrong

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
When people were supposed to...

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
It was because it was overheating

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I don't know

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Download the demo, it doesn't crash on the PS3

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Fine, whatever

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
My Gaming Week, surprisingly enough

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I actually played a little bit of Crackdown this week

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Which is usually not the type of game I would get into

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But Crackdown is kind of fun

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
It's like Grand Theft Auto

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Only there's no hookers to have sex with

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
And you jump really really high

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
And flying all over the place

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
But I find there's a lot to discover

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I kind of like just walking around doing random stuff

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I don't really like having to fight the gangs

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And get into that whole thing

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
No, I like to jump around the Ferris wheel

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
And do the little race around the Ferris wheel

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
That stuff's fun

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And finding the orbs and all that stupid crap

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Good times with Crackdown

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
A couple people tried to challenge me

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
In co-op or whatever

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Or I guess you don't really challenge someone in co-op

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
They wanted to play co-op with me and I declined

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Because I suck at Crackdown

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
But this week I'll probably actually play

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Because I was still trying to learn Crackdown

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I don't want someone to come into the game with me

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
And I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Did I just shoot you? Oh shit, I just blew you up with a rocket

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I don't know

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I kind of want to have a little skill

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Because sometimes I feel weird playing listeners

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
On the Xbox friends list

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
But I think the listeners sometimes expect us to actually be good at games

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Because we talk about them

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
We really don't know about you

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Oh, hi Rice Princess, you came out of nowhere

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Oh, sorry

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
They really don't know much about you then

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
No, they don't

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I was a jab at you

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
JeremyTau1 said, Rob didn't want to play co-op with me

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
He denied me when I asked to join his game

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Actually that may not have been me

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Because the other thing you have to keep in mind

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Is that Shane has been playing my game without asking

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I wish he could set a password

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
On the Xbox Live accounts

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Maybe he can, I just haven't done it

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
I don't care, but Shane has been signing on to my account

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
And playing Crackdown

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I only let him do it because he's been getting me achievements

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
So it's all good

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Because I'm still trying to get those 1500 points

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
So I can win, what was it?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Like a gamer picture and a copy of a game I already own

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Contra, something like that

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Because I want my e-penis to grow by 1500 points

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
With the whole Xbox Live contest thing

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
So that would be fun

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
What?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
So you're having an e-penis fluffer take over

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Yes, Shane is fluffing my e-penis

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Maybe right now as we speak

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Don't make a face, Rice Princess

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Rice Princess, how was your gaming week?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
If you have anything to share

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Hey, guess what? I was playing WoW

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Wow, you played WoW

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Wow, that's the same as every other week

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I play a lot of World of Warcraft as well, actually

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I know

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Almost every time I come on, I see you

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
I made a troll

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
You're a troll

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
That wasn't nice

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Well she is, she said she made a troll

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I made a troll

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Jamie's a troll

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
You're a dirty napkin

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Totally should

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
So did you do anything fun in WoW?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Aren't you one of those twink players?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
You don't level past level 19

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
With all your gear?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
It's 29, get it right

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Oh, it's 29 now

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Because you told me when I played on your server once

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
That you play nothing but Warsong Gulch for the rest of your life

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Yeah, that's what I did originally

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
But then I discovered the world of 29

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
And I was like, wow, you get poisons as a rogue

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
And you get Arathi Basin

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Which I think is an awesome PVP

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Exactly

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Because Warsong Gulch is so

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Last gen

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Oh my god, yeah, like who does that anymore?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
God

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
It's all about Isla Storm

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
The other thing I want to know, where exactly did the term

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Twink come from? Because when I hear

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Twink, I think about something very different

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I don't think about

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
World of Warcraft, I think about

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
The gay porn that you see advertised

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
The twink porn

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
I don't know, it's a little weird

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
That's where the mind goes

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
How did a World of Warcraft

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Term come up to match up with a

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Gay term?

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I don't know for certain, but I have my

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Theory

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Twinks are like

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
The young, hot

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Boys, right? Like the good looking

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Ones that

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
But sure, I guess I get what you're getting at

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Like magazine looking guys

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Well why don't you elaborate on what exactly a

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Gay twink is?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
I don't know if all the listeners want to know

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
It's basically a person who

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I would think, a guy who kind of looks

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Underage, who isn't

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Like your blonde hair, blue eyed

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
That whole thing

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Completely waxed everywhere

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Type look

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
So like the best looking

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
No?

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
It has to do with like an

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Age thing?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Do we really have to keep going with this topic?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Maybe my perception of what a twink is

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Is different

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I thought it was like

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
It had something to do with old men

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Liking twinks

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
So they would be their sugar daddies

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And give them a lot of money

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
And I'm thinking, okay, well to be a twink

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
You need to pay for your stuff

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
So maybe twinking is like

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Horing yourself out to get money

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
To get all these awesome enchants

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
But that's just a theory

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't really know

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I just heard a bunch of people say, oh, twink, twink, twink

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
And I was like, okay, sure

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
That's exactly what I am

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
If by twink you mean awesome

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Alright

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm trying to see if there's anything in the chat room here

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
That says what's going on

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
JV Mon says, welcome to Gay Slang Chat on OLR

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Let's see

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Squeenix says

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
In the gay slang

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Twink is a term that describes a young

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Or young looking male, usually of slender build

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
With little to no body hair

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Often they are described as blonde hair and blue eyed

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
To many gay men

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
The term is pejorative

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
And implies shallowness and stupidity

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Twinks are typically contrasted with bears

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
And that's from Wikipedia

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
So there you have it

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
But that doesn't say anything about, how the hell then

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
You know what, I have no idea

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I didn't realize there were so many gay players

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And wow, right

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
That they would come up with the term

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I'm done with this topic

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I'm done with that, let's talk about other news

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
But I only stopped by to say hi

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Someone leave now

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Bye, get out, we don't like you anyway

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Get out

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Yes

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Most of the podcasts you're listening to this week

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Are probably going to be talking a lot about

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Their experiences at Game Developers Conference

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
But not us, we didn't go

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Nope

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
That's right, we sat home on our big butts

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
And read about it on the internet

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Just like most of you guys out there did at home

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I was originally going to go to Game Developers Conference

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
But some things came up

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
And I didn't end up going

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
But we did get to

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Go to San Francisco yesterday to meet

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Some people that we, you know

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
If I had gone to Game Developers Conference

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
It would have been like a networking thing

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Like I would have gotten to meet a lot of people

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
So what we did is we drove to San Francisco

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Because some of our buddies over at All Games

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Were in town and of course we rebroadcast our program

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Over on All Games on Monday nights

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
So we went over and met with some of the

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
All Games folks, we met with Bobby

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
And we met with Lawrence, although Lawrence we were

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Basically taking to the airport so we didn't get to spend a lot of time with him

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
But Bobby who does the

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Other Sunday night show you might listen to over

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
On All Games, we spent some time with him

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
When we went to Sunnyvale Golf Land

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Which, you know, is a pretty big

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Arcade, kind of infamous

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
In Northern California for the many fighting game

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Tournaments it's had and

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
DDR music game tournaments it's had

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Kind of sad to go

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
In there and see the place as

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Basically turned into like the entire middle

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Where they used to have tons of classic

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Games, like you know

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
They had like the old school fighting games

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And stuff were all up in the middle section

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
All gone and it's all ticket spitters now

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Which kind of made me sad

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
I don't know, I made this big long rant over

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
At my All Games blog

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Over at community.allgames.com

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
About

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
How kind of sad it is just to see that

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
The arcades are kind of

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Really giving way to the ticket spitters

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
And although Sunnyvale Golf Land did have

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Some pretty cool music

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Games, they had, you know, Be Me and You

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
2DX Happy Sky which I got to play and they had

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Pop'n Music 8 which was cool and they had some

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Nice racing games, they had

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Like everything in the little niche genres they had

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I don't know, it was kind of sad to see

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
That most of the arcade is turned into that whole

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Gambling for kids thing

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
So it kind of got me thinking

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
What do you think it would take

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
For us to really go back to arcades now

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Because you know a lot of folks say that arcades

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Are dying because

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
You can get the same experience at home

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
And you can get a lot of them on Xbox Live

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
What do arcades need

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
To do business again?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
New games and well maintained games

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
And just something

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Because even still you can play DDR at home

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
But it's not the same as playing in the arcade

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
And you need the atmosphere back

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
That's pretty much it

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
If I were to be opening an arcade

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It wouldn't have any ticket spitters

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
At all

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I don't care if that's why kids come in there

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
But you need to bring people in

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
That are looking for the arcade experience

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Not just have arcade games

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
So that little Billy can run in there

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
And say mommy mommy I want to spend money

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And play games and stuff

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
And win crap with tickets

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
They just kind of have that stuff

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Out of golf land

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Keep people there longer after their game of golf

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Or before their game of golf

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Dave and Busters

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
Dave and Busters is kind of like that for adults

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
I mean do you really play a lot of the arcade games

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Dave and Busters? Maybe a few

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
But a lot of us kind of succumb to the whole ticket spitting

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Thing at Dave and Busters because we're drunk

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Right?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
No I usually go often

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
You know when they had the

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
What was the meca salt

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I know that that was always what

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Whenever I'd go with Dan and the guys

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
That would be what they went right for

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
And I always played my deluxe games

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
But they got rid of meca salt

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Stupid fuckers

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I'm not really angry at the ticket spitters

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Necessarily it's disappointing to see

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
But if that's where the money is

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
It's not like I'm totally mad at golf land

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Because if that's where the money is

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
That's what they're going to buy

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Granted those ticket spitters probably make them a ton of money

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
But I try to think about

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
What's really been new in the arcade lately

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
That I've had to get excited about

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
DDR Supernova?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Well I'm sorry Bomani fans

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
But DDR Supernova

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Was pretty much just a DDR 9th mix

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It didn't bring a whole lot of new stuff to the table

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Really

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
It was just kind of the same game all over again

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And even you could say the games like

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
In the Groove and stuff that tried to fill in the gaps

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Same thing it was 4 panel dancing

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
It was the same damn game you always knew

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
But even DDR alone was not going to save an arcade

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
You know what I mean?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
There hasn't been a lot of new stuff in general

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
I mean the last big new arcade release

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
I can think of was Soul Calibur 3

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
But that was already on the home consoles

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
So I don't know

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
It seems like they're really starting to go away from making arcade games

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
It's kind of sad

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Because if it weren't for that arcade community

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
This show would not exist

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Period

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
We need more Planet Harrier

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I don't know if that's going to save it

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
We'll see

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
I'm trying to go to the chat room

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
See I had all games on the brain

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Because of our little discussion with Bobby

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Don't go to that chat room, that's the wrong one

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Chat.OrangeLawnsRadio.com

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Let's see

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I'm trying to see what kind of chat is going on here

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Fireboma says the arcade by me

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Is just having games that are more like rides now

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Some of those can be okay though

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Remember After Burner?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
With the freaking thing that you would sit in

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
That would practically make you sick?

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Let's see

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
NM64 says

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Arcade Halo

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Sadly that would probably bring them back

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
You know, I kind of tend to agree

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Something like that

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Do they have that?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Do you remember The Grid?

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
They have Half Life in Japan where you can play that in the arcade

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Really? I think about a game we saw at E3

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
A couple years ago

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I remember it was 04, 05

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
And Amiro of all companies was showing off

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
This arcade game that would actually interface with computer versions of the game

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
It was like a first person shooter

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Yeah, that's pretty cool

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
OL Army Recruit

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I'm sorry, James Patrick says

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Virtua Fighter 5 should come to US arcades

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
I don't know

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
That would be interesting

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Alright, so I don't know if there's an easy answer

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
To how arcades can be kind of fun again

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
For all of us

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Not just, you know, kids

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
8 through 12 or whatever

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
We welcome your feedback

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
And bloggyblog

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Over at the community.allgames site

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And leave a comment, that would be awesome

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And I just want to say thanks to Bobby

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
For hanging out with us yesterday

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
And you should check out his show

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
He's on allgames.com at 5 o'clock pacific time

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
About an hour before we go live over here

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
At OrangeLawnsRadio.com

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
He also does a podcast

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
It's a different show over there

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Because it's just him and his chat room and his callers

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
So the chat and the callers

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Really drive that show

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
He's a pretty good moderator

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And he actually moderated a panel at GDC

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
That Loki and I listened to on the car ride home

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It was pretty good. Good times

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
And I forgot to mention

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I played a lot of games over at

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
You know, Sunnyvale Golf Land

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Loki playing popin' music was fuckin' hilarious

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I hate popin' music

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
But I had like $10 in tokens

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
And I needed to get rid of them

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
And I was too tired to play DDR

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Yet I did play more of it

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
So I played popin' 8

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
At popin' music

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
I'm not surprised because I knew I sucked

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
At popin' music

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
It's just I really sucked at popin' music

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I played the Star Trek theme and that sucked

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
And then I played some random song

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
And that really sucked

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
And then I played 2DX, Happy Sky

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
And I sucked at that and that was fun

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
And I played Supernova and Supernova was pretty good

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Until I picked a random double song

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
That was like a cata or something

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
And I was too tired to play it

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I played part of it though

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
I'm just getting too out of shape for this

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
I'm out of practice

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
BlackWolf

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Is actually in chat right now and says

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Sky might have taken video on his phone, actually didn't

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I did take a picture though, I'll put that on the community site later

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Of Loki playing popin' music

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Good times

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Good times

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
James Patrick's continuing on the Virtua Fighter 5 thing

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
That would be great

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Knowing you could fight anyone in Japan or America

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Who's using the Virtua Fighter 5 arcade

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Kinda going with that whole thing about

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Being able to interface with computers and stuff

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Pretty cool

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Illusion says that Pachinko machines could revitalize arcades

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
That's an interesting thought

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Alright

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
So anyway we had fun at the arcade the other day

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
But going back to Game Developers Conference

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
And starting off tonight's news

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
I want to talk about of course

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Huge news in the Sony department

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
In fact this news is like so big

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
We might actually want to take calls on this

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Just this a little later

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Sony unveiled this week

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
At the Game Developers Conference

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
It's very interesting

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
And we'll talk about Nintendo's conference in part B

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
But a lot of the stuff that you saw

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Like the big companies do

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Was really about the game development

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
They didn't turn Game Developers Conference into E3

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Like a lot of people thought

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Which is a good thing I think

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Game developers need their hangout

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
It was not E3

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
But Sony kind of used their keynote

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
To drop E3 like bombs at

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Where they need to right

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
They're getting the bad press right now

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Everybody kind of gives them a buy

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
To use Game Developers Conference as their platform

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And some would say they hit a home run

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
I think so

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Key word there is home

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
They revealed PlayStation Home

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Of course we talked about it last week

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
But even when we talked about it last week

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
And the whole Kotaku drama that resulted

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I don't think I was expecting anything like this

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
I don't think any of us were

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
When I heard it was going to be like Animal Crossing

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I'm picturing to myself

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Oh cutesy, cartoony

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Animal Crossing with your me's

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
No no no no

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
What they unveiled instead

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Is a service that looks like Second Life

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
It's like a virtual world

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
And here's a screenshot we have here in studio

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
You can see all these people with their customizable outfits

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Kind of walking around this virtual world

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
But not only that

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
When you're in this virtual world

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
You can invite people over to your virtual apartment

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
And you can look at your virtual trophy rack

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
They've basically taken Microsoft's achievement system

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And kind of evolved it into

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Hey you can get trophies that you put in your house

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Look at my stuff

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Come over and look at my stuff

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
But not just that

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Let's say you want to put a TV in your apartment

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Then you can run videos on your TV from your PlayStation

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Put pictures up on the wall

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
That you have on your PlayStation drive

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Walk up to a pool table that you put down your place

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And actually start playing pool

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
They're going to have some games included with this

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
All of it, free

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
It's going to be part of

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
That's basically what they're saying

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
What Microsoft is giving you in Xbox Live

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
We are now going to give you this service

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Called PlayStation Home

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
And it's free

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Of course the money that they're going to make

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Advertising on all the billboards throughout the place

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
And people love to customize

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
So unless you want the raggy

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Cheap Ikea furniture in your apartment

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
If you want some of the nice

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Bling couches and stuff

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
You're going to have to probably pay for those

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
People will probably do it

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
People will do that because they buy shit in Second Life

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
So this will all roll out

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
In a closed beta

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Of about 15,000 users

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Between April and August

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
The open beta, about 50,000 users

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
August through October

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
And the service will go live with everybody

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Probably about October

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
The best part about those

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
They're saying different games

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Kind of like how they have with the gamer pics

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
And the games that you play on Xbox 360

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Right now, you're going to be getting

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Custom outfits and crap for your house

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Basically by playing games

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Or unlocking achievements

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
You'll get different things that way as well

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
So that's kind of neat

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Alright, and that wasn't the only thing

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Sony unveiled at the conference, correct?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Yes, there's another game that they were

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Touting, it's basically a game called

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Little Big Planet

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
And it's basically a community made game

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
You create your own levels

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
The entire thing is physics based

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
It's kind of similar to like Gary's mod

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
In Half Life 2

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And you create these little

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Almost like platformer levels

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
That you and your friends will play

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
And try to find their way through

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
And so it's totally customizable

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
You'll be able to download them

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Rate them, and so on and so forth

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
But it's just, it looks like

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
A lot of fun

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
And it's actually selling a lot of people

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
On the whole

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Playstation 3 experience

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
What they were definitely pushing

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
With their keynote was

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
This game 3.0 where

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Most of the content out there would be

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
User created, which is kind of ironic

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
When you think about it because

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
They have all these firmware updates and stuff

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
For the PSP to stop user created

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Content for that

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I think that's kind of funny

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
But yeah, definitely

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Cool little game

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Hopefully it will come out soon

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Definitely

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
One of the types of things that Sony

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Is going to need

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
It's kind of like

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I think we've all been waiting for something like this

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Out of Sony

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I don't know about you guys, but this is definitely

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
This put the brakes on the negative Sony press bandwagon

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And now I think Sony's turned around

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
In another direction

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
But I would say the question is how much

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
I've heard people say everything from

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Eh, whatever

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
To I'm going to go out and buy a Playstation 3

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Now this is exactly what I need

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
If you guys are Playstation 3 owners

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
What do you think about this news?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Well it's awesome because their current service

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Sucks

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
By the way, everyone wants to know

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Is BlackWolf still your only friend?

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
No he's not

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
I do have about 7 now

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
So thank you for those people that sent requests

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
That's awesome

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
It's just basically

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
With the whole friend request system

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
You don't really know who's on there unless you talk to people

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Thank you, I have more than one friend now

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
That's awesome

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
So the surface

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Since I already own a Playstation 3

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I personally probably wouldn't buy

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
A Playstation 3

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
For just this stuff

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
But it's definitely helping it

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
It makes their service look a bit nicer

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
It fleshes it out

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Because before their network service was like

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Well fuck, we don't know what they're doing

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
And to be honest, as of right now they haven't done anything

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
So this home service

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Is going to be pretty awesome

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
It's going to be a great way to actually meet people

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
And to be able to add more friends that way

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
And just a really cool community thing

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
And I think it's going to have the same appeal

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
As Second Life or Sims

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
People are going to be customizing their own

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
You're going to see

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Home places that are going to be themed around

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Your websites

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
And you know

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
It's going to be crazy

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
You're going to have people reporting from home

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Jamie, any thoughts on this?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I have MySpace

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
And LiveJournal for getting in touch with people

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I think all I would do

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Is just sit around and mess with stuff in it

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Like I do with The Sims

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
I hate Second Life by the way

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
But

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It wouldn't be any

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
It wouldn't make or break it for me

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
But since I already have it, I would use it

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
That type of thing

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
For me, I don't own a Playstation 3

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
And I've actually had several people ask me

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Is this going to make you go buy a Playstation 3?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
No

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
But it helps

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
But again, what is the golden rule of gaming boys and girls?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
A system is only as good

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
As the games that are on it

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
Trust me, this is a huge step in the right direction

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Because I love that

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
You know, they've kind of done something

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
You know, come to think of it

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I think we had a caller last week or the week before

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
And I'm so sorry to the caller

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
Because I can't remember who called in and said this

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
But somebody called in and said

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Sony is really good at ripping everybody else off

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
And doing it a little better

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
That was actually on a podcast

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Somebody else said that

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
But when I heard that on the podcast

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I remember somebody calling in

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
And saying it as well

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
And I thought to myself

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
You know, when we took the call on air

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I was kind of like, oh yeah, okay

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
That's a cute thing

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
But I was kind of thinking when I saw this

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
God damn, they're right

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
That person, whoever called us, stand up and take a bow

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Whoever did that

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Because that was absolutely right

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
We all thought

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Microsoft's achievement point system was genius

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
It's great, it's wonderful

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
And now we look at what Playstation 3 is doing

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
And we go, hmm, the Microsoft thing kind of seems

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Kind of not as good as it could be now

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Next to that

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
They just have the problem of being there first

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Yeah, I guess so

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
It's just interesting

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I still like achievements

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I still love 360

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
But it's just kind of interesting that Sony could still do that

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Even with all this negative press

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Wow, they really kind of did rip something off

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And make it better

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
One thing to keep in mind is that with the

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
As we progress

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
As more and more and more ideas come out

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
After a while it's very hard to innovate

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Once you've already thought of what you can do

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
The only other thing you can do

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Is expand on the idea

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
We've never seen Nintendo doing this

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Because they can't embrace online

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
So

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Who cares?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Well, I'm still thinking

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
I will probably end up

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Breaking down and buying a Playstation 3

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
When some of the games I want

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Come out like Final Fantasy 13

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
But I don't

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Think I still want to run out and buy a Playstation 3

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Just yet for only this

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Although I think it's really cool

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
And if you are thinking about buying a Playstation 3

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
For only this

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
You need to wait until this stuff comes out

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Because a lot can change

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
They can promise the moon for you

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
But they can deliver shit

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Honestly

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
I think E3 this year

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
For Sony is so critical

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Because I think they need to make up

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
For Zonkin out last year

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
And I think this year at E3

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Now that they've kind of set the stage

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Because that's kind of what they do with the game developers

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Is they've kind of set the stage

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Everything around, the big case

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
That Playstation 3 is going to

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
The big central thing now

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
That Playstation 3 is going to have

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
It's going to be about the games

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
That needs to come out at E3 and say

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Here's the exclusives

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Here's the first party stuff we're developing

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Here's the stuff that's going to really make you want

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
A Playstation 3 now

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Because I think about all these trailers and things we saw

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
At E3 last year

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
That we really have never heard about again ever since

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Maybe little bits and pieces here and there

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Africa with a K

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Can we find out why I need Africa

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
And why this game is going to be so flipping great

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Because when we saw the trailer before

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
We were like, I don't get it

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I think about that game

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I can't even remember what the hell the name of it was

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Remember the trailer showed the gas station blowing up

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Or something in the cars

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
What was that with the two guys

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
It looked kind of neat

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
What the hell was that?

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Where did it go?

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I guess so

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
I went to vaporware land

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I just think it's so important

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
For Sony to come to E3

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Now saying, now you know the box

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
That we're putting this in

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
The box off with games

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
And that truly is going to get me rah rah rah

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
About Sony again

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I'm kind of curious

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Has your guys' opinion of Sony changed at all

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
From the home run they hit at Game Developers Conference

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Loki?

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
It's about time that they did something right

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
So that's great

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Originally when I heard about home

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I thought it was going to be a rip off of

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
The Miis

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
No, not at all

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Now it's a rip off of Second Life

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
They took a business model, at least they took the right one

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Because Second Life is

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Really successful

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
As far as people making money off of it

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
As soon as I saw

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Oh yeah, you're going to be able to buy clothing and stuff like that

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
On the service

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And actually customize your characters

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
I'm like, oh well, cha-ching

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Basically

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
They're going to make a lot of money

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I think it's great

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I do like the way that you can jump in

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
And play multiplayer games

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Just by meeting people

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
So that's kind of cool

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I don't know

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
They just wait to see what they do with it

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Because they've been talking to a lot of online communities

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
With their games coming out

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
It's just going to be

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Interesting to see how they implement everything

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
We are going to open up our Skype

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Line in a rare occurrence here

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Just to get your feedback on this component

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Because I think this is so big

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Especially with all the

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Whining

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Just kicking of Sony while they're down

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
People have been doing

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
I'm really curious to see what our listeners think

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
About this whole thing going in the other direction

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
We are going to take some real quick calls

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Before that though I want to get some chat comments

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
If you want to call us 1-877-GAME-OLR

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
And then I want to hear what Jamie has to say on this as well

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
First let me get some chat comments here

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Let's see

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I was saying that somebody here

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Said something really good up above

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Sorry guys, live radio scrolling around

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
There it is

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Rob D said

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
This doesn't matter to me

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
I need games

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Not a Trojan Horse Media Center

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Give me games

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
It would be a good bonus

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Let's see

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Allusion says yeah a new Sims game comes out

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
And someone says I like the Sims better

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
When it was called PlayStation Home

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I think kind of making a joke about

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
How Sony kind of rips things off and does it better

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Let's see

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
The game is shallow and sucks except for resistance

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Even now

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Zappy I believe saved the day there

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Earlier in chat Zappy believes that the game

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I was talking about was called 8 days

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
That sounds right

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
That does sound right to me as well

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Dark Soccer do you have anything you want to

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Say about the whole Sony

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Has your opinion of them changed?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Or you still think they are eating crayons over there or what?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
I still think they are eating crayons

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
But this is a step away from the crayons

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I think that they have moved away from crayons

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
They are eating paste

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Because paste at least

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Is flour based

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
They are eating

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Paste in those little

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Star shaped

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
String cheese nuggets

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Let's go to the skype line

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And see what people think on this

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Who is this?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Ravenstaufen

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
What do you think about Sony at

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
GDC?

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
It's definitely a step in the right direction

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Are you a Playstation 3 owner currently?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
I wish, no

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
But you say you wish now

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
No I have been wishing

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
So does this make you want it even more?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Yeah

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
What do you think

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Is going to be the coolest thing

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
About everything that came out of GDC?

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
What are you looking forward to doing with

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Home or with LittleBigPlanet?

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I thought Home was a

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Very good idea

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
The only thing I want to do is stream porn from my hard drive

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
To my TV

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
You can kind of do that anyway

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I don't know about the hard drive on your computer

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I think you can stream the movies on your TV

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
But I'm looking at some FAQs

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
That came out about it

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
One of the questions that was posed about Playstation Home

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Can I launch and watch a

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
BD movie from within Home?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Launch yes, watch no

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I think some people were thinking that you would be able to put

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
A porno on the TV in your apartment

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
And that would play

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Well you could go to that and launch the movie

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
But it won't actually play the porno in your apartment

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
At least that's the impression I'm getting

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Which seems, the logistics of that seems like it would be

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
A real bandwidth eater anyway

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
So it's probably for the best, right?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I got bandwidth

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I think it will actually stream whatever it is

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
On that TV because they said they had dynamic

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Well, I forget if it was like

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Dynamic sound or something like that where

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
As you walk closer to the source it will get louder

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
And that kind of thing

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
What do you think should be

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Sony's next move, Raven's Dolphin?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
What should they do at E3?

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
I don't know

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I think they should definitely put Home

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
In a good response but I definitely agree

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
That any games

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Like to support the Home

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
More games that support Home would be a home run

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
So maybe some games that incorporate the Home thing

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Because one thing that's interesting about what Sony

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Is doing versus what Microsoft is doing

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Is Microsoft requires developers

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
To put achievements in the games

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Sony is just kind of letting it be there

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
And if the developers want to

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Put things in it then great

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
If when you beat Final Fantasy 13

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Let's say if Square wants to

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Give you a little cloud sword

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Even though cloud's not in Final Fantasy 13

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I don't know, humor me here for a minute

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
A little cloud sword that you could put in your PlayStation Home

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
That would be up to them completely

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
So kind of interesting

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Yeah, two more things

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Alright, hurry

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You have to buy a Bluetooth headset and a USB

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Are you?

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I already have one for my 360

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
It's going to be a tough sell on Sony

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Sony will need to tell me why I need it

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Okay, and

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
The next thing about the trophies

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Did you see that room?

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I saw some of the videos

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
It looked like one room had a crap load of trophies

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Maybe from all the arcade titles

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
I don't know

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
And one thing from Second Life

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Am I going to launch pink dicks at people

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
That I don't like?

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
I have a feeling since this community is going to be a little more moderated

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Probably not

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
With Second Life you can kind of user create things

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I haven't done a lot of Second Life

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
But there's more user creation in that

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I don't think you really get that so much here

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
You get user customization

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
But not so much creation

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Alright, thanks so much for the call Ravenstaufen

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
You're welcome

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Alright, we'll take one more call and some feedback with the Sony stuff

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
1877 Game OLR

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Over on Skype

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Of course we encourage you guys to interact with our program

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
That's what we're here for

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
We're just three folks that like video games

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Just like the rest of you

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
We want to hear what you guys have to say as well

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Let's take another call

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Hey, it's SSJ100Matt

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Hi SSJ100Matt, what do you think about this whole Sony home thing?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Actually, I'm liking it a lot

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
You're liking it a lot?

43:14.000 --> 43:20.000
Were you somebody that wanted a Playstation 3 before Game Developers Conference?

43:20.000 --> 43:28.000
I actually know originally I was split between a 360 and a PS3

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
So what do you think now?

43:30.000 --> 43:36.000
Well now I've got to start thinking about the PS3 now

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
Before I was like majority 360

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Now I'm back in the middle

43:42.000 --> 43:47.000
So I'm going to wait until this home thing picks up around October

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
And then I'll make a decision

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
What about home that puts you back in the middle with all this?

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
Originally I used to play The Sims a lot

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
That was basically my guilty pleasure

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
That thing was like crack

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
This is kind of like The Sims

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
I know I'm going to be on this thing customizing buying crap

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
To make my place look good

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Speaking of customizing LittleBigPlanet

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Is that something that appeals to you?

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
It looks really nice, I think it will be great

44:19.000 --> 44:27.000
Because I think they said something that they're going to come out with a full version

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
Where it's just going to basically be user created courses

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
And bring that out in retail or something

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I think it's going to be very interesting to see how that plays out

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
When it's actually out there on the marketplace

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
Because now it seems like Sony is starting to listen to people

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
And they're going to be more welcome to user created things

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
Thanks so much for the call SSJ100 Matt

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
We've got to get back to the news

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
But take care

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
Take it easy

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
We'd love to take more calls

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
But we will take calls later in the show during part B

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
And if you want to talk about Sony home at that time

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
Certainly you can

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
But we need to get back into some news, right Jamie?

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Yeah, news would be a good thing

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
I need to cleanse the palette of Sony

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
I sense a little bitterness about Sony within you

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
The bitterness is strong with this one

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
It always has been

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
But speaking of things that are a little less bitter

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
Is that in Fable 2, which will be coming out

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
You can have a dog

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
And he walks around with you

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
And he growls when he smells the people sneaking up on you

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
And you can't really tell him what to do

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
But you can gesture to him and he'll learn to follow

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Well, he'll always follow you

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
But he'll go along with you and be your puppy

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
And lick your face and eat your chickens

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
And that type of thing

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Wait, he'll eat your chickens?

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
I don't know

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
That's not good

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
Do the chickens fight back like they did in Zelda?

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
I don't know

45:54.000 --> 45:59.000
But I wish they had cats

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
That was kind of disappointing

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Because I'm more of a cat person

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
But then again I suppose the cat would control you

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
Apparently you can also be a pregnant woman

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
And catch diseases

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
You can get knocked up within Fable 2?

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
You can have sex, you can have unprotected sex

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
And protected sex, you can get STDs

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
That's making the fantasy out of my game

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
How many different kinds of sex can you have?

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Is there going to be a whole Kama Sutra?

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
Hot Monkey

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Will butt sex be involved?

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
They had gay relationships in the first game

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Butt sex is not just a gay thing

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Well, that's true

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Good point

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
The dog is pretty awesome

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
They're saying that you're actually going to care for this dog

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
It loves you

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
And it will try to keep you safe

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
And stuff like that

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
It's pretty cool

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
They have some videos on gamevideos.com

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
Basically talking about the whole dog aspect of the game

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
It just looks awesome, I really want it

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
It's way better than in 10 Dogs

47:05.000 --> 47:09.000
DDRDollarBill says

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
I want to have sex without E-Herpes

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
And DDRDollarBill says

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Surprise butt sex?

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
I guess that's something you could do in the game

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Surprise butt sex on people

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
I don't know, probably not

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
I just don't know

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
If I were going to have something useful I'd have a pet wolf

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
SSJ100Matt says

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Do we get extra points for donkey punching?

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
I want a pit bull

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
And NM64 says

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Everyone has AIDS

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
Because if you're allowed to run around and have unprotected sex in the game

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
That's the likely conclusion

47:39.000 --> 47:42.000
I wonder if you could start an epidemic in the game

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
It's kind of weird

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
But I suppose this answers the question now about

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
What was the big secret about Fable?

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
It was puppy dogs and diseases

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
I guess so, there you have it

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
DDRDollarBill says

47:54.000 --> 47:59.000
You're going to have to buy your condoms with your MS points

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
That's funny

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Little microtransactions out the wazoo

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Yeah, maybe you'll be able to get a cat

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
But you'll have to pay some points for it, I don't know

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Alright

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Well, there was

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
You have to change the litter or you die of methane poisoning

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
There were some other announcements that came out of Game Developers Conference

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
And I love me some Mizuguchi

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
Of course Mizuguchi, the fine fellow who created Rez

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
I believe Space Channel 5

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Luminous

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Meteos

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
Some of the greatest games, 99 Nights, not so much

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
Feeling the love there

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
But everybody's allowed to make a mistake

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Well, this Make No Mistake here

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
Every Xtend Xtra Xtreme is coming to Xbox Live Arcade

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
And it looks like the audio and visual sex capade

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
That you would be expecting from Mizuguchi

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
I mean, just kind of look at these screenshots here

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
Of course, every Xtend Xtra was a game that was out on the PSP

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
They're going to be making this version as well for Xbox Live Arcade

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
And of course they're calling it E4 for short

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
Because every Xtend Xtra Xtreme get it, there's all the Es there

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
They're going to be able to battle others in an online versus mode

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
And that's kind of something that's a little new there for Xbox Live

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Of course, just look at how trippy that looks

49:10.000 --> 49:14.000
I mean, this is going to be an amazing seizure playable game

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
But I really like every Xtend Xtra on the PSP

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
It's kind of a unique sort of game

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
It's not really a puzzle

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
It's like a

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
I mean, it has puzzle elements

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
You have to think about what you're doing

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
But it is kind of an action game

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
So it's unique

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
And I'm a big supporter of unique games

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
So this is a perfect announcement for Game Developers Conference

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
So check that out on Xbox Live Marketplace

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
When it becomes available

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Probably later this year

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
At least as far as we know

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Yeah, late later this year

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
Christmas

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Christmas

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
Anyways, one thing though that's making games like this possible

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
Is the fact that Microsoft has officially raised the file limit

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Of the Xbox Live Arcade games

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Originally it was 50 megabytes

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
To fit on that wonderful 64 megabyte memory unit

49:58.000 --> 50:02.000
Of course, now that they've also announced a larger memory unit

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Which is going to be 512 megabytes

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Now they can have games that are even bigger

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
Including games up to 150 megabytes

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
And even higher with permission

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
So that's excellent

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
And I know one of the first games to actually utilize that

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Was going to be Symphony of the Night

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Because I think that was like 98 megabytes

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Yeah, that's when these rumors started

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Because of Castlevania

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
I had thought that Microsoft already confirmed this

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
So I was kind of surprised to see this making the rounds on news sites again

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
Well, they sort of confirmed it

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
And then they made a press release about it

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
So now it's official official

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
These stages of gaming news

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Especially Microsoft gaming news

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
Because Microsoft news always starts out as a rumor first

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
Because Microsoft rumors 99% of the time are true

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
So there's a Microsoft rumor

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
And then it evolves into random dude at Microsoft

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
Or a Microsoft blogger said, yeah, we're working on it, shh, don't tell

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
And then it evolves into like a press release

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
And then it's like, oh, it's official now

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
Microsoft has said, hail the larger Xbox Live arcade games

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
I'm sure every XtendXtra will benefit from that 150 megabytes

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Here's the other thing I want to know though

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
Now that the arcade limit has been upped

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Mr. Mizuguchi and everybody over at Q Entertainment

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Whatever happened

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
It's been like a year now, whatever happened to Madonna in Luminous?

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
And I'm not just saying Madonna specifically

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
Contrary to popular belief, I could give two shits about Madonna

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
But I'm talking about the licensed music in general

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
We got one song, Heavenly Star, which was an in-house thing anyway

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
Where's the rest of the content that's supposed to be in Luminous?

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
No content for you

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
I guess not

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Sorry, I got on a tangent there

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
This is supposed to be about the thing

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Talking about Mizuguchi made me think about that

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
What the hell ever happened to Madonna, etc.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
The puppy ate it

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
I guess so, the dog ate it

51:50.000 --> 51:56.000
Well, you know something that you don't really have to worry about

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Well, I don't know, I'm sort of worried about this

51:59.000 --> 52:05.000
Peter Jackson is doing some episodic content for a couple of Xbox 360 games

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
And one of them is Halo

52:06.000 --> 52:09.000
And I'm wondering, dude, what's he going to do for Halo?

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
That'd be very interesting

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
There's not too many details about it

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
And I don't think anything on what the other game is

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
It looks like it's still in development

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
But I don't know, is it going to involve giant monkeys?

52:22.000 --> 52:26.000
Well, if you know Peter Jackson is doing it, you know it's going to be long

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
Like three and a half hour, butt-numbingly long

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
Like certain movies that he's made

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
In fact, most all the movies he's made in the past few years

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
God, seriously

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
Don't get me wrong, Lord of the Rings is cool and all

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
But damn, those are some long movies

52:44.000 --> 52:50.000
It seems like episodic content has become this real buzzword of the past couple of years, hasn't it?

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
It seems like everybody and their mom is doing episodic content

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
What could they really do for Halo episodic content, you think?

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
Do you think this is something they'll do like two and then say, oh, there was your episodic content?

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Or is this something you could see actually going on for a while?

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
I mean, God, if any community could support something like this though

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
The Halo community is huge and loud

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
I would see this happening like after Halo 3

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
And it would be for Halo 3, not its own game

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
Just like additional story, single player stuff

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Or co-op missions or stuff like that

53:18.000 --> 53:22.000
It's kind of similar to the co-op missions in Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Or something like that

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
It's not really episodic content, it's just downloadable content later on

53:27.000 --> 53:33.000
Because to be honest, there aren't that many episodic content games out there

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
I mean, even Half-Life or whatever

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
They're only up to episode two and two hasn't even come out yet

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
You know I'm going to say Sam and Max

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
Sam and Max, yeah, that's one that's actually pretty good

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
But what else besides that?

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
I agree, Sam and Max is the only ones that seem to be doing it right

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
It's a buzzword thrown out there a lot and it's not being done

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
I mean, it's just like digital distribution for movies and stuff

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Everyone talks about it, but it's hardly done

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
We've got to check in with the chat room because there are some funnies

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
Of course, going back to me bitching about the whole Luminous thing

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
Joshi16 kind of combined the stories together and says

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
Madonna would give you the Herpes achievement, Sky

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
So insinuating that maybe Madonna will actually be in Fable

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
To give you the STDs that you can get inside the game

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
So that's certainly an interesting thought from Joshi16

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
Let's see, Lazer is a winner for this reference

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Maybe the Dingo ate your content

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Ahh!

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Now I'm getting all Meryl Streep

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
The Dingo ate the baby!

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Anyway, let's see

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
You're so a winner for that comment

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
What else was there about episodic content?

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
I thought it was very interesting here in chat room

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
Well, Firesafety says there are already giant monkeys in Halo

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
So I guess you can't really say that that's what Peter Jackson is going to bring to the table

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
Let's see

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
Firesafety also says hopefully it's nothing like Half-Life 2 periodic

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
yearly maybe content

55:01.000 --> 55:05.000
Funnydale says episodic content equals 3 hour games every year

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Yep, that's basically what it's been so far

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
So I'm hoping Halo will break that mold

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
We'll see

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
Well, this is not a happy story here

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
But some news came out about Castle Crashers

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
Loki, you were all excited about Castle Crashers

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Because this is the game that kind of looks like

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
It looks like an old school arcade

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Hit the buttons, hack and slash type thing

55:29.000 --> 55:32.000
Like a brand new one, this looks awesome

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
Well, when approached

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
Behemoth's Dan Paladin

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
They won actually an IGF award

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Dan Paladin actually commented on the game

55:42.000 --> 55:45.000
He noted that the Xbox Live title still had

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
About a year of development left

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Meaning the Castle Crashers

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
Looks like it will now be out in 2008

55:53.000 --> 55:58.000
But now the good news about this is that since the size limit has been increased

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
One reason that's been kind of a conclusion

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
That's been jumped to over this is that

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Oh, they're going to go back and make the game bigger

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
Thanks to the size increase

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
So maybe good things will come to those who wait in terms of what's there

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
So I know you were really anxious about this game, Loki

56:13.000 --> 56:16.000
Are you okay with this delay if it's going to make the game better?

56:16.000 --> 56:17.000
Are you pissed?

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
Do you wish they just released something now and maybe do a Castle Crashers 2?

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
Oh, I'm fine with them delaying the game

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Most likely even if it wasn't because of this

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
It would be delayed for some other reason

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
I mean, who cares?

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
There's supposedly more content coming out now

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
So I'm fine holding off on that

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I mean, it's one of those games that look neat

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I wasn't like, oh, I gotta have this now

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
I mean, big deal

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
I don't know, I can wait

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
Alright

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Well, I don't know

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
But game delays, they kind of get me a little bit angsty

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
I don't know about you, DarkSakura, but you know

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Anytime a game I look forward to gets delayed

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Whether it be for the right reason or not

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
I get a little pissed off

56:55.000 --> 56:56.000
What about you?

56:56.000 --> 56:57.000
Um, sometimes

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
So that means that because we're pissed off

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
Well, this is one of those times, DarkSakura

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Help me out here, because we got a segue

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Roar!

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Thank you, and to the FUs of the Week

57:06.000 --> 57:16.000
Music

57:16.000 --> 57:21.000
My FU of the Week is, as usual, traffic-based

57:21.000 --> 57:25.000
Fuck you to men with small penises who drive big trucks

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
And also fuck you to sacramoms who drive SUVs

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
I leave it at that

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Moki!

57:31.000 --> 57:36.000
Fuck the fact that I can't find two files for Pop Station

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
For the PSP

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
And those are two important files that I need to make things work

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
I did find, however, though, there is one game that I have

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
That I really should put on my PSP

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
And that is Einhendr

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Because that would be fucking awesome

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
That's it

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
Alright

57:53.000 --> 57:54.000
I didn't have really anything that

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
Oh, fuck to the fact that this room is like a scorching

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
I don't know

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
I think somebody turned the fan off

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
I'm gonna go check that

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
It's like fucking hot in here

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
It is

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
It's just me

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
No, I know

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
I'm bringing them here too

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I'll go look at the temperature in a minute

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
But I want to say my FU of the Week would go to

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
Daylight Savings Time

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Oh my god

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Ugh, I hate Daylight Savings Time

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
How dare you rob me of an hour of my sleep

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
I don't care if there's farmer kids with school

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Or whatever the hell reason they say

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Energy consumption

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Whatever the hell excuse they have

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
FU Daylight Savings Time

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
I'm dying of fire

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
Hey, that was a pretty short FUs of the Week segment

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I'm kind of sad a little bit

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
Well, don't be sad

58:38.000 --> 58:39.000
Anyways

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
There's one reason you shouldn't be sad

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Xbox Live hit six million users

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
They apparently did this four months earlier than they had expected

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
And not a big surprise

58:51.000 --> 58:54.000
Because, you know, they offer those two day subscriptions

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
And pretty much anyone that plugs in

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
You know, their console into the internet

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
They are logged into Xbox Live

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
So, and they didn't really say what the six million mark meant

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
I mean, whether that's going to be silver or gold or whatever

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Um, I don't know

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
So, take it with a grain of salt

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
But yay, there's lots of people on live

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
That's all you need to know, I guess

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
More people to flash us their ass, you know

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
On the camera

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
Hooray

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
Yay ass

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Speaking of which, how have you noticed?

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
The camera for the 360

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
Completely useless, like the iToy

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I have kind of noticed

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
What about Rayman Raving Rabbids on the 360?

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
Oh, I'm guessing that's going to be about as good as any iToy game

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
That's a damn good point

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
When was the last time anyone said anything about the Xbox Live camera?

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
And why is it we haven't gotten more games like Uno?

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
You would think, based on the success of Uno

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
That we would have seen like, you know, we would see like Old Maid

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
And like freaking Skip Bow

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
And I don't know, whatever else card games and casual games they can come up with

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
On Xbox Live by now

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Is it just a rights thing? I don't know

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
It's lame

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Well

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
There are though some things that are not quite as lame as that

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Although there's not many things that are really as lame as that

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Um

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Some news for our European listeners though

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
You know, we've been talking about Blue Dragon

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000
It's going to be released in very likely September in Europe

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
As was announced at a game developers conference

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Isn't that cool?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
And I'm thinking that I've actually been really excited about this

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
You know

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I mean, I'm still sort of back and forth

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
But we have to wait until August to get it

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And so I think by then I'll decide whether or not I really am going to be able to dedicate the time to another RPG

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I think it's going to be awesome

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
I think there were a couple more details on Blue Dragon this week

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Because I thought about, Loki, you said

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Already on this show like a month ago that Blue Dragon was coming out over here

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I think you might have said July

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
But whatever, it got delayed a couple weeks, big whoop, right?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
But we all knew it was coming over here

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
But I seem to remember one cool thing that I remember reading about Blue Dragon

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Is that they're going to have both the English language and Japanese language tracks in it

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Kind of like how Enchanted Arms had

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
So if you're one of those people that's like, I hate it when they dub this stuff in English

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Because blah blah blah blah blah

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Then fine, you can watch the Japanese stuff with subtitles

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Everyone's happy

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
So I'm actually really looking forward to Blue Dragon

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Just because, you know, how could you not be?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
It's, you know, the team that made the original Final Fantasy

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Kind of, I don't know

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I'm very excited about it

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Looking at chat room to see what's going on there in chat

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Let's see

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Joshi16 will not let the Madonna thing go

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Because Joshi says Madonna needs a live arcade camera game

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Dude, you need to get your issues worked out there with Madonna

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Let's see, what else do we have here?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Blaze says simply fuck the Xbox Live camera

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
There you have it

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Mori agrees, Xbox 360 skip bow would be amazing

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
You know what would be more amazing than Xbox 360 skip bow?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And props to you if you know this game

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I might be horribly pronouncing it because it's French

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
But this is like my favorite card game ever

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Xbox 360 Millborn

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
You ever played that game?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
With the roll and stop and punctured tires

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
It's like a racing card game

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
No

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Oh my god, it's the best game ever

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I love that card game

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Bring me my Millborn on Xbox Live Arcade

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Sorry

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
I'm ranting tonight

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I'm a demanding little bitch tonight

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I'm sorry

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I'll be good

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Alright

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Oh I'm sorry, we got a release date to talk about

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Wow

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Live Radio

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
See I get all ranty and then I completely forget about talking about release dates

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
But I suppose we should talk about the Japanese release dates

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Because these are usually the things that we're going to see over here in the US before too long

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Or over in Europe as well

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Well coming out on the Xbox 360, not a lot

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Except some games are going into the Platinum Collection on March 15th

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
So you can now get Battlefield 2, Burnout, Chrome Hounds, Perfect Dark Zero

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
All at a lower price over in Japan

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, you get G.I. Jockey Wii is coming out

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Sonic 2 Himitsu Ring is coming out on March 15th

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
That would just be Sonic and the Secret Rings

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
SpongeBob SquarePants also making its way to Japanese audiences also on March 15th

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
We're sorry Japan

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yeah, sorry Japan for that

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Sometimes things from our culture will stink up your things

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
On the Playstation 3, Fight Night Round 3 making its way to Japan on March 15th

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
As well as a game called Dust Cap 3

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
I don't know about you, but I've never heard of Dust Cap 3

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
That's not a game, that's why

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Wow, I need help tonight

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Dust Cap 3 is just an accessory

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Because I was like, whatever happened to Dust Cap 3?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I was like, what the hell is Dust Cap 1 and 2?

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Sounds like the name of some weird RPG or puzzle game

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I've never heard of Dust Cap 1 and 2, apparently Dust Cap 3 is literally that

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Yeah, forget it

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Also coming out

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Let's not submit this show for podcast award consideration

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Because it's just not that good tonight and it's all my fault, I'm sorry

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Coming out on the Playstation 2

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Konjiki no Kouda 2 is coming out, also from Koei

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Big week for Koei Entertainment

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
A game that's going into best hits, I love this title

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Princess Maker 4 is coming out

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
So if you've ever wanted to be your own princess

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Now you can for a much lower price

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I don't think that's exactly what that's about

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It's called Princess Maker 4

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Look at the box art

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Doesn't that look like princesses?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Having a good time there?

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Look at the description

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Princess Maker 4 is the fourth installment of the popular promotion simulation game

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
In which you become the father guardian of a young girl

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
You must raise her to become a princess in eight years

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
See? It is Princess Maker

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
STFU, you don't know what you're talking about

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Anyways

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Wait, I have more

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Dust Cap 4 is coming out in 2008, look for it

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
No, on Nintendo DS real quick

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Bionicle Heroes, the Konami Arcade Collection is coming out over there in Japan

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Also, Kuro Kuro Princess

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And Lost in Blue 2 is coming out on March 15th as well

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
And Fingerprint Guard Film Light

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I love that one

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Just kidding, I knew that wasn't a game

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Alright, I'm done

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Anyways, US, pretty much as far as games go

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
There's really one big one this week

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And that would be God of War 2

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Coming out in PlayStation 2

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
PSP is not seeing much else either

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Call of Duty 3 Road to Victory

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
That's going to be coming out as well this week

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
The 360, we're just getting a re-release of Call of Duty 3

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
The Gold Edition, now with downloadable maps

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Actually included in there, I believe you get tokens for that

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
And some special behind the scenes DVD or something

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Lame

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
For the PlayStation 3, you're getting College Hoops 2K7

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Hooray

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And let's see

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
For PC, quite a bit of stuff coming out

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
None of it looks very good though

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Some highlights, the Top Spin 2 is coming to the PC

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Battlefield 2 complete

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
And the rest sucks

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
For the Wii, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Get your golf on, and then for the DS

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
You have Mind Quiz

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And that's another ripoff of Brain Age

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Can I say another game I played this week real quick?

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I played Quiz and Dragons with Bobby Blackwolf

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
And we were so horrible at that game

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Words cannot describe the handicap we will need on future games of Quiz and Dragons

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Which is now on UltraCade apparently

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Even though UltraCade, you know, we're a little meh

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
But yeah, Quiz and Dragons will own you

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Herbie Rescue Rally DS

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Which is a port of a crappy movie

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Made into a crappy game

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Now on the DS

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And it looks crappy

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
That's it

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I just have to say real quick, sorry chat

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
No Rob

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
It's chat, it's chat

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
The chat room was making fun of my fuck up earlier

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
DarkTetsuya says dustcap 3, dustcap's revenge

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Fireoboma says dustcap 3 gets more incredible

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And Illusion makes the mandatory dustcap 3 electric boogaloo

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
That would be dustcap 2

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Anyway, how about our European releases?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
How about it?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
A Bunch of Crap on the 16th

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Yeah, maybe some of it's kind of crap, some of it's kind of cool

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
We have Call of Duty 3, Championship Manager 2007

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Free Running, Legend of the Dragon

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Lunar Knights, Vampire Hunters, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney, Justice For All

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Puzzle Quest, Challenge of the Warlords

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Rayman Raving Ravids

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Rome Total War, Saint Seiya the Hades

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Samurai Warriors 2 Empires

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Spectrobes, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on DS

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Test Drive Unlimited, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
And UFO Extraterrestrials

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
And also coming out this week in Europe

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Sorry guys, you're only going to get dustcap 2

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Because you always get screwed on the release dates and having to wait for things

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
But enjoy dustcap 2, we have been for the last 3 years

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Sound fair?

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Very fair

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
We love you overseas listeners, we really do

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Well another love affair that's going on right now is Electronic Arts and Harmonics

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And it was just a real brief thing that came out, was leaked to the media this week

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.000
That Electronic Arts announced they have penned a deal with MTV Networks and Harmonics

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
To publish Harmonics' next game

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
However what that game is, is a secret for now

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:14.000
So it's interesting though because obviously Guitar Hero was something that Red Octane published

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
But now EA is going to be filling that role for whatever Harmonics' next game is

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I seem to remember previously said, and it looks like this article makes reference to it too

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Harmonics once said that Guitar Hero is just the tip of the iceberg, just the beginning of what these games can become

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000
And I seem to remember Harmonics saying that their next project was way bigger than Guitar Hero

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Like a real thing

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And a lot of people speculated it's going to be a game that really teaches you how to play guitar

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I don't know

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I'm still waiting for Sax Maniacs

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000
I kind of wish they'd bring back the Amplitude thing in some new evolved regard

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Because I did love me some Amplitude

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000
They could evolve the game, make it next gen somehow, a little more competitive

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Crackin' DJ over here

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Crackin' DJ was not even a Harmonics, that was a Sega game

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I don't care, it's still fun

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Crackin' DJ, I haven't heard that in years

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000
At least Crackin' DJ sort of made you feel like you were actually remixing stuff

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Because you were going through the same motions as an actual DJ would

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
So that was kind of neat

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And I will be kickbanning users in chatroom who said that the game Harmonics is making is Dustcat 4

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Let the joke die you assholes

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I think we have the start of a brand new joke to beat into the ground

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Dustcat 4 bust a cap

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I saw that in there, that was funny

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Ha ha ha

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Anyways, so more EA news of course

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.000
They are kicking off an online music competition featuring singing sensation Lily Ellen

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Who the fuck that is?

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I am not hip to these artists out there

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Anyways, apparently Lily Ellen, they are doing, I guess this is coincidentally

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Let me just put this in perspective for people

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
If the music doesn't sound like

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Puch pooch meow meow meow meow

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Puch pooch meow meow meow

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Then Loki doesn't listen to it

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
If it's not cat techno, it's not for me

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
So, anyways

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Apparently she is doing a version of her song, Smile, for Sims 2

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Which is going to be in Simlish, which makes it sound even more retarded

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
So, very excellent

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Just so you know, Lily Allen is a newer artist who has recently peaked at the number 2 position in the UK

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
With her single, Alright, Still

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And it actually peaked at number 20 here in the US

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And that is who Lily Allen is

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And I've seen this, I've probably heard this song before

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Don't make me pull up a clip

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
To which I would say, alright, still don't care

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
So, but if you do win this contest though

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:01.000
You will be winning a prize package worth approximately $1,390

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:09.000
And have a chance to record a song in Simlish for possible inclusion in a future Sims 2 game

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000
So, great, you get to sing a song in gibberish that's going to appear in a game

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
That probably no one will actually pay attention to the music

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
That sounds awesome

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I want to sing a song in gibberish

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
That's my song, Lily Allen, are you listening?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
You could totally sample me on your next record

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Isn't that like the Strong Bad Lights which rave all of a sudden?

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So, how about SingStar?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Oh, yay, there's another thing I'm looking forward to on the Playstation 3

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Well, we are having, for SingStar there's going to be a release in the US in fall

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
It's going to be early June in the UK

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:55.000
And they are going to be doing this thing called Game 3.0

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
It's a very interesting thing

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Basically, you're going to be able to download new content

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
But upload content as well using your USB camera

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
You can record videos

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
And then everyone will look at it

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Like a Numa Numa kid or something

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Dear God who is in heaven, please listen to this boy's prayer

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I've been a very good Rob this whole year long

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Please, please, please God Almighty who art in heaven

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Please, please make Loki get really drunk one night

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.000
And record some videos on SingStar

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And upload them to this Game 3.0 service

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
So that the entirety of the internet can download and make fun of him

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Thank you, amen

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
What?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
God doesn't listen to you

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Come on, Loki, you know you want to do it

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
No, you want me to do that

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I do

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I don't want to do that at all

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I am not touching that fucking game

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Karaoke will not be entering my house

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Fuck that shit

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
GS68 says

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I don't know, it makes me think of a Caturday macro

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
It says, I'm in your OLRs, drunk in your hosts

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Maybe that's God speaking

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
We all know we're all going to hell

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Probably

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Except not me because I don't believe in hell

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
We're going to wherever pagan people go

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Let's not turn this into a religious

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
We're not a God cast

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Go look up God cast in iTunes if you want religious stuff

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
We've got to talk about games

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
And one game that we'll talk about here is Warhawk

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It's interesting because Warhawk went that it was going to be downloadable only when it went over to the Playstation 3

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Here's the other thing you need to know

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Warhawk is not going to be single player now

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
It's going to be a multiplayer only battle arena

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Since the game has moved into the Playstation Network

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
It's a downloadable title

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
It's only going to be something that you can play online

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
But the cool news is that you don't get to just do planes

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
You can do jeeps, tanks, infantry units, and the whole works there

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
So you need to get some other online modes as well

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
But if you don't like to play online games, too bad

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Warhawk will not be for you on the Playstation 3

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
It's just like Star Fox 64

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
It's like Star Fox is all about flying

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Now I have to run around and I have tanks and shit

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Why can't it just be about the flying?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Eh, whatever

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Anyways

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:20.000
So when you think about high end computer systems, you probably don't think of Commodore

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
But they're hoping to change that

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Because now they are back and they are trying to make a name for themselves

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
If the year was 1984, I would be thinking about Commodore

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Because the Commodore 64 was my first gaming platform, really truly

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Commodore 64 is an amazing piece of machinery

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Amen

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
So yeah, now they're launching a new Commodore PC

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Geared for PC gaming, and it's supposed to launch at Germany's SeeBit show

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Actually this week, March 15th

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
I don't know

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
They're basically saying that's going to provide what gamers need and want

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Excellent

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Can I play Last Ninja on it, yes or no?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Better

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Because if not, there's going to be one hell of a syntax error coming out of this angry gamer

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
That was a Commodore joke

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Don't laugh at once

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Yeah, that's why no one got it

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
That's why we're on the internet, boys and girls

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Not satellite radio or the real deal

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Maybe we should call ourselves Video Obscura

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
That'd be an awesome name

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
That's actually not a bad name for a podcast

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000
At least Video Game Obscura

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
At least people would know we're a video game podcast as opposed to when people go

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
What the hell is Orange Lounge Radio?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Are you guys a lounge music podcast?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Yeah, we just had Richard Cheeze on last week

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Speaking of cheese

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:46.000
There is a Lego MMO that is in development coming in 2008

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
It's being developed by NetDevil for auto assault

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.000
You go around building stuff and talking with people

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
It's just an MMO with Legos

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
It's for kids, but I love Legos so I'm probably going to play it

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I love Legos too

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I remember when you tried to make the charging cradle out of Legos

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
I did make a charging cradle

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Speaking of which, I broke the charging cradle this week

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Because Nelly wanted to play Elite Beat Agents

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Because she's been playing that game now

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I had to rip the cable out because it doesn't work very well plugged into the

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
For those that didn't hear the shows a while back

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Loki actually built a DS charger out of Legos

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
So it was like a docking bay

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
He built one out of Legos

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I like Legos too

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Actual Legos

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Not so much all these games

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I measure my Legos in gallons now

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
And I still have 10 gallons of Legos in my closet

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Let's build the next OLR studio out of Legos

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
We don't have enough Legos for that

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I did one time build something

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I used to have this desk that stretched one whole wall on my room

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:03.000
And I used every single Lego to build one giant, like, base thing or something

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
It's just like a really cool, like, I don't know

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
You remember Classic Gaming Expo though

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Where they built the Space Invaders thing out of Legos

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
Hey, is Classic Gaming Expo coming back this year?

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
I heard they were going to be in Vegas this year

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
They're supposed to do, I think, the 10th anniversary

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I want to go, I want to go, Jamie, let's go

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000
But I'm going to something else

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
I'm going to Pinagogo

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I heard a rumor you were going to

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I don't know if I can say it on air, but

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Yes, I'm planning on, if I can at all manage it

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I'm going to be going to Dragon Con

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Okay, she said I didn't

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
I want to go to be there at the podcasters panel

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Just, you know, right now it's like

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.000
How am I going to afford that?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.000
But, you know, I'm working on it

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I played Monopoly Pinball

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And I was actually kicking ass over at Sunnyvale Golf Land yesterday

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
What the fuck does that have to do with anything Dragon Con?

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
She mentioned pinball

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Pinagogo

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
It's going to be a hard time

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
I don't know if I told, you know, everybody

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
But we did get a new machine

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And we got a bride of pin-bot

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
And we are actually

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Dan has my Rocky and Bullwinkle working now

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Which makes me intensely happy

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And our Guns N' Roses is now for sale

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Aww

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Will you sell it to someone on the internets?

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Oh, but shipping would be an arm and a leg

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
If they live in the area

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Or want to come pick it up

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And pay us a lot of money for it

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Then I don't think we have a lot

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Define a lot

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
How much are you selling the Guns N' Roses for?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I don't know, it's up to Dan

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
He actually may have a trade worked out on it

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
But I think we are also selling our Johnny Mnemonic

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
It's a good pin, but I hate Johnny Mnemonic

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
You should let us know some prices

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Well, I'll talk to the hubby and see

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
If he wants me to use our independent

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Non-corporate sponsored podcast

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
To sell my pinball machine

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Why not? You got to get something out of this deal

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Seriously

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Alright, well something else you can do

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
If you love Orange Launch Radio

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
We'll give some cheap plugs

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
For some of our other stuff right now

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
You can always leave us a review on iTunes

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Because we could definitely use some more 5 star review on iTunes

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Because it helps spread the word about the program

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Also, you can visit our MySpace

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
www.myspace.com

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Slash Orange Launch Radio

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
And be our friend on there

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Because who doesn't love having a thousand friends on MySpace

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
And being attention whores over there

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Also, we are now

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Participating in the new All Games Community site

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Over at community.allgames.com

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Most of us are so far

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
You will be as of tonight

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
We will all have profiles on that site

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And I'm actually using my blog over there

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000
It's kind of fun

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And I've been doing official

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Well, not, I don't know, official

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Whatever, but Orange Launch

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Video game review haikus

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Where I review games in haiku form

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
So if you want to see what the hell that's all about

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
You gotta go find my page on

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
The Community All Games site

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Because I review video games in haiku form

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
575

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Anything else we should plug

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Before we take a break

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I don't know

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I can't think of anything

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
This is kind of a short show tonight

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
I have a weird story

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
But it's not gaming

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Well, it's

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
No, it's not gaming really

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
There's some weird reason

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Like, this is weird

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Usually our shows have been running

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Almost to the two hour mark

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
We haven't even hit 90 minutes

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
For part A this week

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Why not?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
A short story from Loki

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Okay, this is kind of weird

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I was watching Comedy Central today

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
And Spike TV absorbed Comedy Central

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Like, at least on my Comcast box

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
So two channels were Spike TV

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Which were playing some really crappy

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Pros versus Joes

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Or something like that

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Thing, which is

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I don't have any interest in sports TV

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
But it was funny though

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Because all of a sudden

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
It was like Spike TV

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Also last night I was watching G4 TV

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Because they had cheaters on

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
And that was kind of funny

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
What else are you going to watch

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Like, you know, at midnight

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I don't know

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I guess I could have watched Saturday Night Live

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
But that's not funny

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
So

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Actually, hey

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
But Saturday Night Live did bring us

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Laser Cats this season

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
It is getting better again

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
It's not

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
It ain't

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
It ain't

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
It's Dana Carvey

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Chris Farley

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Or, you know

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Especially not

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
It's Gilda Radner

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Or Dan Aykroyd

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Days

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
But

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
It is still pretty

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
It's getting better

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Than it was last year

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Of course, usually I try to go out

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
On Saturday nights

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
So I don't know

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I don't get to watch it at home a lot

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
But I do see, like, the YouTubage and things

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Come on, what did this year bring us?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
This year brought us Laser Cats

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
It brought us Dick in a Box

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Some good stuff

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Good stuff

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I actually

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
I actually

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
When I went to New York in October

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I got to see the set

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
That was kind of fun

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
In a touristy way

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
So, hey

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Any other

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Do you have any short stories

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
You'd like to share with our listeners

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Um

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I'm starting a

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
A fund that's called the

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Send Dark Sakura to Dragon Con Fund

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Either that or buy me a Dolphie

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Why don't you massage your way to Dragon Con?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
You know, I would

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
But I have to take a whole lot more massage classes before then

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Oh, that sucks

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
But, um

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I'm actually

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
You know what

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Two weeks to go, Rob

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
No, three weeks, sorry

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Three weeks to go

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I will be a fully certified massage therapist

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
And then I can charge everybody

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Cool

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I guess

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Well, I mean

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Massage is good for your health

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Maybe they need

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
You know

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Conventions are a lot of walking

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
You should massage people's feet

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I'm actually thinking about

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Um

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Cause my friend

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
A lot of my friends are on the

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Fanime staff

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I'm actually thinking about asking them if I can

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Get an event license

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
God, Fanime's right around the corner too

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
May, end of May

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Yeah

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
But I'm seeing if

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I'm gonna see if I can

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Get like an event license from

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Wherever I have to in San Jose

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
And set up a

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Set up a

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Massage at

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Fanime

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
There you go

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Fun

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I don't have a chair yet

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
But I can rent a chair

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Alright

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
So for the weary

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Fanime con-goer

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Do you know how often

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
I've been in

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Fucking costume

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And wish someone would rub my feet

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Cause I was in

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Freaking

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Five inch

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Platform heels

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Oh my god

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
My Mad Hatter costume

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I've worn many an uncomfortable costume

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
But my Mad Hatter costume was the worst

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Because of the wings on my back

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
And the fucking heels

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
So

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I think massage therapy

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
At

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Anime conventions

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Is brilliant

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Alright well we'll see what happens

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Holler if you hear me

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Alright

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Holla

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Alright

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
We better go ahead and take a break

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
So we'll be back

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
After this short break

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
