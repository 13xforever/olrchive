Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are that video game podcast dedicated to what you, the gamer, really want to know

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You know, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, and all that fun stuff

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky if you check our forums or whatever

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's S-K-I-E, Sky

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Joining us, as always, say hello to Tech Master Loki

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hello

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How you doing Tech Master Loki?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm doing okay

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Alright, you might wonder where Dark Sakura is at tonight, unfortunately she's not joining us tonight

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
She's very sick, she sends her love to all of you guys, but she has a sinus infection

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I spoke to her on the phone briefly before we started tonight

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And she apparently slept for 14 hours yesterday, which is, you know, a pretty surefire sinus

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Someone's pretty sick, so, sorry Dark Sakura, rest up, feel better

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And I was all excited too because I saw a Doctor Who pinball machine this weekend, which I'll get into in a little bit

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No, but seriously, I was like, oh my gosh, this is like, this is Jamie times two

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
These are like two of her loves rolled up into one

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Sort of like what I thought of, like Loki, I've had this thought about you before

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The first time I ever went to that restaurant in the Bay Area that serves the slabs of meat

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And they served the chicken wrapped in bacon

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That made me think of you, because I was like, it's two of Loki's love

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I might add, the chicken wrapped in bacon wasn't that great when I had it, so

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Sorry to hear that

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Alright, well we do have a female perspective on tonight's program

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You know, not that we really need one, but we have one anyway

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Just teasing, to all the ladies out there listening

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Say hello to Rice Princess

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hello everyone

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
How are you doing Miss Rice Princess?

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm doing well, how about you Rob?

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, pretty good, it's been an interesting week

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, I agree

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I agree

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So you were talking about movies before we came in tonight, what did you see this week?

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now how was it, because I read a review in some magazine that said it was absolute crap

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well that magazine's absolute crap, because it was so fucking awesome

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Like it was fucking epic, it was great

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Was it better than the old school ones from like the 90s with the ninja wrap?

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There are two different things, that's apples and oranges

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I just, I loved it, and I loved the old movies too

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Chime in Matt

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I did see it yesterday as well, and I, because I was a little scared

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Because when I first saw the first trailer that came out, it looked badass

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It was like, oh yeah

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Then I saw these new trailers that they're showing on TV and stuff

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And they kind of made it look stupid

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But I swear, go see it, it's fucking awesome

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And the reason why, they did make, it does tie in with the other three movies

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And they do make some changes to the storyline

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You know, it basically takes place after everything

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And so, you know, April O'Neil's not a reporter anymore

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And Casey Jones isn't exactly like he was in the other movies

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But that's fine, you kind of forgive that when you see it

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's just, it never lets you down

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It was one of those movies that I was watching it, and I was just like, fuck, this is awesome

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You know, it wasn't, really I haven't had that much of a satisfying movie experience in a while

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And this was one of those movies that just, it was awesome

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It brought me back to what made Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles so cool in the first place

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It just, it was very satisfying

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And I really suggest, just ignore the negative reviews out there for it

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Because it really is good, and I cannot wait for the sequel

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Are you on somebody's payola, like New Line's payola?

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm not, I'm not on anybody's payroll for this kind of stuff

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It was awesome, and yeah, I would love to see it again

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It really, there's a lot of parts that even have, you know

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I was telling Irene about one scene towards the end of the movie or something

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Which has to do with my Cage Man song, by the way

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That, it's just, when that scene kicked in, it was like, fuck yeah, that's awesome

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So, highly, highly recommend this movie, especially if you're a fan of

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You know, the original Ninja Turtles movie, maybe not so much number two and definitely not three

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But, you know, even the old series and stuff, it really works

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And it sounds like that this is going to be something that kind of jump starts the whole movie series all over again

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm looking in our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Because, you know, part of what makes this show so unique, shall we say

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Is that we always encourage the live interaction with our chat room

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And the phone calls, which we'll take later, chat.orangelaundry.com if you want to join in

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you're listening live on this Sunday night

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's see, we have Blaze from the O.L. Army says TMNT was fucking amazing

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Joshi16 says one of the turtles is gay, is there a gay turtle now?

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There's not a gay turtle in there, not at all

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's see, Wonder Dog Harold says are they really still teenagers at this point?

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay, well maybe not, yeah, because they're pretty old by now, but I was kind of thinking, well maybe teenage for, like, turtles

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know how long turtles live, but, you know

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, I've never done that

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Maybe it's like dog ears or something like that, you know, I don't know

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, I mean, not to, I don't think this is spoiling anything, but they've all, like, kind of, I guess, taken on, like, responsibilities

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Or have, like, moved on past, like, how they used to live before

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I guess it's kind of showing that they've, like, grown up a little bit, but

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't know, they still, I guess their mentality is still kind of, like, a teenage mentality

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
There was a lot of adult humor in it, which is great, like, a lot of funny stuff

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It was just awesome, I mean, I mean, if anyone that's going to see it obviously doesn't have to do a shredder anymore

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is kind of after all that, they've defeated them, the Foot Clan's kind of been disbanded a little bit

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Where at least they've gone underground, and then it's kind of what they've done since then

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They kind of went on with their lives, because now they don't have to really protect, you know, New York from anything

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They're just kind of living, and so now they have to kind of come together

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And, you know, it's just, it was really awesome

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Even the opening scene where they're showing kind of that flashback with the battle and stuff

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That was awesome

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That was great, oh my gosh

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Right now I was like, oh my god, this movie's going to be cool

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Because it was just, it never let you down at all

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There was a little bit of humor, you know, from the show

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Because, I mean, they were kind of, you know, Michelangelo, of course, is still goofy and stuff

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But it wasn't, like, detracting, and it was, it fit, it fit with the characters

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And I'm just really glad they kind of respected the actual characters

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And didn't make it so retarded and all one-liners

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I mean, there were one-liners in there, but it worked

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, it did, like, a lot of them were puns, but I absolutely love puns

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I think puns are, like, the greatest jokes ever

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And, like, it really worked, I mean, if you were a fan of the old cartoon series

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Or if you watched the movies, I mean, you saw that anyway in the movies or the series

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So it's, like, it was just more of that, you know, and it was appropriate to the times, too

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The only thing that really kind of annoyed me was Splinter's voice

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I know, I know, like, I'm all, did, like, some Chinese dude, like, do his voice or something?

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No, he sounded Jewish

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Really? You think so? I'm like, wow, Splinter

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh my god, Turtles

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I know, seriously, it was kind of weird, but

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, alright, we can talk movies all night

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Did any of you guys play the games yet? The Ninja Turtles games?

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No, no

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I played the old one on Ninja Turtles

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That, unlike the movie, did kind of suck

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Alright, well, let's get into a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Where we talk about the video games that we've been playing this week here on the program

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Rice Princess, what have you been playing?

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Um, I have actually not played anything this week

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I, like I said before, I cancelled my WoW account for the time being

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Ouch

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So I kind of have been not doing, I've been, like, doing stuff around the house

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Did you watch anyone play something that looked cool and that you wanted to have?

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, no, you know what I played? I played DDR

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Did you? Alright, there you go

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
In the arcade, yes, for the first time in, like, two years, it was awesome

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What was it, Supernova, Extreme?

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Um, I played, um, Supernova and I played a little bit of, um, whatever's that golfing?

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The other one, Extreme, I think it was

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Max 2, I think

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I played that, yeah, it was good times

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Memories?

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, like, I was surprised because I could actually do, like, 7 and 8 footers again

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Whereas I couldn't do that, like, two years ago

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And I was like, sweet, I don't suck anymore

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So, yeah, it was good times

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Cool, Loki!

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I finally, I've been waiting for this game for a while

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And it's just a really weird game to wait for

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But Earth Defense Force 2017, it is awesome

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It is so stupid and so ridiculous and the voice acting is so horrible

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But it's so fun to play

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's just, basically, at least

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I know nothing about this game, what is this?

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It is basically these aliens come and start attacking Earth

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And it is so B-movie, cheesy and stuff

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I mean, for example

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Like, Destroy All Humans?

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Not exactly, like, we're talking, like, robots and giant ants

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I mean, that's giant ants

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's what you're fighting for the first few levels is giant ants

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And it works

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, in Final Fantasy, you fight giant slimes to level up

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, but still, though, I mean, it's giant ants

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And the voice acting is so horrible

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Like, for example, they're all, look, it's flying

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Or, look at those alien spaceships

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's like something out of the science fiction movie

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Not a science fiction movie, the science fiction movie

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Like, the one and only that's ever been made

174
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Exactly

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And so, I don't know, it's just, I can't stop playing

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Basically, you have, you can collect up to 200 weapons in this game

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
By replaying the levels over and over, you can level up your characters

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Or whatever, get your stamina higher

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And you can actually, you can play it through five different difficulty levels

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I've been playing it through, like, normal and easy

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And even normal is starting to get hard now

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Playing it on hard, which is not even all the way up to, like,

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
They have, like, extreme inferno or something

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hard is fucking impossible

185
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So, inferno's gotta be, oh my god

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh my god

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But, it's pretty fun though

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's two player co-op, which is kinda cool, split screen

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So I'm really looking forward to playing that at work

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But, it's just so cheesy though

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's really worth picking up

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The achievements are not easy in it

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's basically beating the game on each difficulty

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And unlocking every single weapon

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's your achievements

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Six achievements for 1,000 points

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But, it's, you know, it's one of those games though

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You have infinite ammo

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And you have some weird weapons that are in the game

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
In fact, there's one missile that I unlocked in the very beginning

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a piece of shit

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's the slowest moving missile I've ever seen

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I mean, the thing is going, like, less than five miles an hour

204
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Just crawling across the air

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And it doesn't hardly do any damage

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But, it's fun because you can pick, you know, one of two weapons

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
To use each, throughout the whole game

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So you just select your weapons, play your mission, and that's it

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And the best part about it though, you can blow up everything

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Buildings, doesn't matter, no one gives a crap

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Because you're saving the earth

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So, what do I do? I just start launching random missiles

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Into every single skyscraper I see

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And watching them all fall

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And it's entertaining because they're there at the next level

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Because there's no continuity whatsoever

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So do you recommend the game?

218
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I highly recommend the game

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let me tell you, the frame rate's crap

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The graphics suck, the sound is awful

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And the voice acting's horrible

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And the AI is pretty retarded as well

223
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So are you saying it's so bad it's good?

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It is

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's the showgirls of video games?

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's so bad, it's so bad

227
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But that's the thing, you gotta play it

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Realizing that it's gonna suck in these areas

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And to be honest, the graphics don't need to be that great

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's like an old arcade game

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I mean, old arcade games, they're not that many polygons and stuff

232
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But it works, it's just fun to play

233
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So it may look like crap

234
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It may be very fucking hard at times

235
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The AI can be dumb

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Because I saw some soldier or whatever

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I was trying to find these people

238
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So they would join me and help kill the alien ants

239
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And this guy was shooting a shotgun into a building

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Because he was stupid and couldn't figure out how to get around the building

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's awesome

242
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know, it's funny

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But it's still a lot of fun to play

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It does not stop getting fun

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So really highly recommend this game

246
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's only like 40 bucks for the 360

247
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Definitely worth picking up

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Even if you can find it used, that's even better

249
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So I recommend it

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's a lot of fun

251
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Definitely a lot better than from what I've heard from Armored Core 4

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And other than that, I played Crackdown a little bit

253
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's about it though

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I've been just trying to get the last few achievements and stuff

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Kind of getting a little bored with the game

256
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Because now that you're at the end of the game and stuff

257
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There's not much to do

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh, and Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories

259
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We've been playing that

260
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
At work we put custom firmwares in all of our PSPs now

261
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So we're all playing it overclocked, which is fun

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It actually looks a lot nicer

263
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We have a guy that's working

264
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Actually he's a pretty famous cheat designer for the Vice City Stories

265
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Durga Durga Man

266
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He's working on a multiplayer code to switch out some of the weapons

267
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And get some different stuff

268
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So hopefully that'll happen

269
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And I am so looking forward to this week when the Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer hits on Friday

270
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That is going to be awesome

271
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I am going to watch that thing like 16 times on Friday

272
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Analyze every frame

273
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh yeah

274
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Alright, we'll be looking forward to your thoughts on that trailer on Sunday then

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh yeah

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Alright

277
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Miggletov, I noticed you snuck in here while we were starting the show

278
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
First off, hello, how are you doing?

279
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hello, I'm fine

280
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Alright, how was your gaming week? What have you been playing?

281
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Only been playing two things

282
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
World of Warcraft, I made my alternate character

283
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
His name is Agathon

284
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And his pet is named Helo

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh my gosh, that's awesome

286
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Because I'm a big Battlestar nerd now

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Because it's so good

288
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It is so good

289
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's the best and Helo's hot

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And then other than that, finally at work

291
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Thanks to being at a developer place

292
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I've been playing a lot of Boom Boom Rocket

293
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And it's the best game I've ever played in my life called Boom Boom Rocket

294
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And it's pretty and I love it

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm not sure how to take that

296
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's the best game you've ever played in your life called that

297
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I could say Big Mother Truckers was the best game I ever played in my life

298
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's a lie, because it wasn't a good game at all

299
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But Boom Boom Rocket, if I didn't have a 360, would sell me on a 360

300
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Because it's really just that much fun

301
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What the hell is it? Because I still don't know that much about it

302
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Are you allowed to tell us what it is?

303
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I won't mention specifics, I don't know

304
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's not our game, I don't care

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's a music game with fireworks

306
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So it's like Fantavision meets DDR with a touch of Beatmania

307
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Because the fireworks make noise for Beatmania

308
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And if you hit arrows when you're not supposed to

309
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It penalizes you like Beatmania does as well

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So you can't just mess around

311
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But the track list is not stellar, but it gets the job done

312
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And if you like Fantavision and you like pretty things

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's really, really fun and lots of explosions

314
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
High def, good stuff?

315
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, oh my goodness

316
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I don't know, I must have played that a lot this week

317
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I got all the achievements, they're all really easy

318
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Especially if you play music games

319
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And it's just a whole lot of fun

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't know, it almost convinced somebody at work to get a 360 too

321
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Because he was really enjoying it

322
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Interesting, so the music game fans will be all over this

323
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Maybe, it depends on if you care about the quality of music you're playing the game to

324
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Alpha Canogram says it sounds like every Xtend Xtra

325
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No, because this game is good

326
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I liked every Xtend Xtra, whatever

327
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Every Xtend Xtra

328
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Music was a part of it, kind of like Rez

329
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But Rez wasn't really a music game

330
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The music was an important element

331
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's what every Xtend Xtra is like

332
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
This is a rhythm game, it's not a game where you blow something up to cause chain reactions

333
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Every time you hit one of those arrows, fireworks explosions happen

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's like DDR once you hit a hundred combo

335
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You get a little flashy explosions

336
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But there's timing issues with the game too

337
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And I don't think they'll be fixed before

338
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm pretty sure what I was playing is the release candidate

339
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I just need it to come out now really bad

340
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That's it

341
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Alright, we'll see what happens

342
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
My gaming week, interestingly enough

343
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't know if you were listening last week

344
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But I mentioned I was going to be going on vacation for a little while

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So I have been on vacation the past four days in the middle of nowhere

346
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I was up in the Mendocino, Fort Bragg, coastal area, Northern California

347
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
No internet, no phones, no games, really nothing

348
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So it's just nice to have a break away from everything

349
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'll get into what effect that's going to have on tonight's show in just a minute

350
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But yeah, I just took a break

351
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But before I left, I did get to sneak in a little bit of Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live

352
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh my heck, it is awesome

353
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's so great

354
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Just the fact that they brought back one of the greatest video games of all time

355
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And they didn't change much

356
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They do have that enhanced mode

357
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Which basically means somewhat smoother, cleaner sprites and changed sound effects

358
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But really they didn't change that much

359
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Don't let that talk of a new high def mode thing fool you

360
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It still looks like the old PlayStation 1 game

361
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But that's not a bad thing

362
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,000
No, obviously

363
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Especially for Xbox Live Arcade

364
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah, if it ain't broke, don't fix it

365
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Exactly, and really they didn't change anything

366
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's an awesome deal for $10

367
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I mean, great, if you still have your old PlayStation hooked up

368
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And you've got your disc available to play the PlayStation games or whatever

369
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Then have fun, go play the old version as you remember it

370
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But for the rest of us, our PlayStations were thrown in the closet a long time ago

371
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We lost our copies of Castlevania Symphony of the Night

372
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is awesome

373
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Didn't you mention something about no loading times or anything?

374
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh yeah, there's no loading times

375
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You don't have to wait for anything

376
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
They kept all the voice acting intact

377
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's great, I mean, I definitely recommend

378
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Especially if you've never played it before

379
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh my gosh

380
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's got a lot of hours that you can put into the game if you've never played it before

381
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
There's no excuse to have never played that game before

382
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Like, I don't care

383
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm looking in chatroom, Blay says Sky was a hippie for four days basically

384
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, basically

385
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,000
When it comes down to it, I was

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, so back to Symphony of the Night

387
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, I'll be playing plenty more Symphony of the Night now that I'm back from vacation

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And another game I picked up today was Tetris Evolution on 360

389
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But I've literally played it for 15 minutes, so I don't have enough to say on it

390
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
My initial impressions are, why didn't they just put this on Live Arcade?

391
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But then again, it was only $30, so it was a cheaper title

392
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And the idea of being able to play Tetris on Xbox Live is pretty cool

393
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But I'll give you my full thoughts on that next week

394
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Because it doesn't seem bad, but it doesn't seem as great as Tetris DS either

395
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And those are just my initial five minute thoughts

396
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But I'll look at it more in depth later

397
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It looked okay, they had videos playing in the background

398
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The HD videos looked pretty hot, so I'll give you that

399
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But what was kind of interesting though is they also had

400
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You can cheat in it just like you can with the Tetris DS

401
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You can rotate blocks or whatever and then you can actually

402
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Basically kind of hover them there forever until you decide where you want to put them

403
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's pretty sweet

404
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Alright, so I'll give you more thoughts on that next week here on the program

405
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight

406
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
While I was out for four days, apparently some stuff has gone down on Live 365

407
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And it has to do with this new CRB, the Copyright Royalty Board

408
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If you want to know more information on it, go to www.live365.com slash choice

409
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And of course, Live 365 is where we broadcast our live feed

410
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Obviously the live element is an important part of our show

411
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We don't want it to go anywhere, so we suggest you guys all check this out

412
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I know our buddy Travis Donovan went into detail on this on his program on Saturday night

413
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I haven't had a chance to listen to it yet, so if you want to go check him out on iTunes under Travis Donovan

414
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You can check out what he has to say on it

415
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We don't know what we're going to do about this yet

416
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We understand it has changed some rules already on Live 365

417
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Which may be kind of a pain in the butt to listen to us on Live 365

418
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Long story short, we don't play enough ASCAP, BMI type music on this program

419
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
To justify if they're going to raise the rates much more of keeping Live 365

420
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We don't know yet what we're going to do

421
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We do have other offers on the table we're going to be looking at

422
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And if we have to go underground, we may just do that as well

423
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But obviously the live element is an important factor of our show

424
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And we don't want to lose that anytime soon

425
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
This shouldn't affect the podcast feed

426
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Worst case scenario, if the rates of Live 365 had to go through the roof

427
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
We might have to go a couple of weeks with no live element

428
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But we would find a new home, set up something on Shoutcast, I don't know

429
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But seeing as we're Orange Mountains Radio is a bit of a network now

430
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Because we have some other great shows like STFU on Thursdays

431
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And Travis Donovan on Saturdays

432
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We don't want to lose any of those other shows that we've built up over time

433
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
More to come on that when we have some time to sit down and take this all in

434
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What's going on with us

435
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Because again, I'm just getting back and kind of hitting all this news

436
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And I want to check out what the rest of the OLR staff has to say about it

437
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So we'll see

438
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Travis Donovan is in chat and says

439
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Urges folks to visit Live 365.com slash choice

440
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And says you all need to contact your local congress person

441
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And let them know they need to level the playing field again

442
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Over the air radio does not pay royalty rates

443
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But internet and satellite radio must

444
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Doesn't sound very fair to me

445
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And it's going to hurt the little guys like us and other great Live 365

446
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And just internet radio stations in general

447
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So that kind of sucks

448
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So we'll have more info on that next week

449
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
We'll see

450
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Also, as far as housekeeping goes

451
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Tonight we're going to change things up a little bit

452
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Dark Sakura's not here

453
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And I, of course, have been out of town for the last four days

454
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So I'm a little bit out of the loop on gaming news

455
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So Loki's going to be news boy tonight

456
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And all of our news tonight will be presented by Loki

457
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So we are going to break our usual format a little bit

458
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So take it away Loki, what happened this week?

459
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Hooray, well the big thing that happened, of course

460
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
At least if you're in the UK and most of the other world

461
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The PlayStation 3 finally came out for you

462
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That time has finally come

463
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You can finally buy your overpriced gaming machine

464
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And there were some interesting stories coming out about that

465
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Of course, one that pretty much sums everything up

466
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Phil Harrison

467
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Basically was saying that Europe is the most important continent

468
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
For the gaming industry

469
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Which is funny because it was also the last one to get the PlayStation 3

470
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But apparently the third is also the most important

471
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And he was told

472
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You know, this gameindustry.biz

473
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Big industry site

474
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's got the most countries and it's got the most people

475
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's also got the most cultures

476
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The fact that we've got the launch here

477
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
With more consoles shipped on day one

478
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Than we've ever had in our history

479
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Is a compliment to the most important market

480
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Of the world, the European market

481
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't know, that sounds a lot of sucking up to me

482
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Especially since

483
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What?

484
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
They've had so many delays, they've had to pay more

485
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
They didn't get the 20 YIG model at launch

486
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, and which we'll get into a little bit later

487
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Their backwards compatibility has kind of been

488
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Hurt a little bit

489
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So

490
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't know, I think it's kind of stupid

491
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
This strikes me as nothing more than fluffy PR

492
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Nothing less, nothing more

493
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is just nice little sound bite statements

494
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Made by official Sony people to get all over the Europe press

495
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
About how freaking important they are blah blah blah

496
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And believe me, listeners abroad

497
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm not trying to belittle the situation

498
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But obviously

499
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
If Sony cared that much

500
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
They would have done things a little differently, correct?

501
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But oh wait, it doesn't stop there

502
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
To prove that point

503
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
They even went out of their way to give out free TVs

504
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
To the first 100 people purchasing the Playstation 3

505
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
At their London launch event

506
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Free 46 inch HDTVs

507
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
And a free taxi ride home with those

508
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Jesus, that's not a bad deal

509
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Where's my damn TV?

510
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I want to know

511
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Wait, the 100 people that sat out online

512
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Like this incentive to wait in the cold or whatever?

513
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah

514
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So in the US, you have to wait two days

515
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And dodge bullets

516
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Maybe have to race and slam into a pole

517
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And get sent to the hospital in a coma

518
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Exactly, and then in the UK you get free TVs

519
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
To go with your gaming systems and stuff

520
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, Raven's Dolphin in chat says

521
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
We get shot, they get TVs, what the fuck?

522
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That's a big PR

523
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Is that just because British people are nicer, or what is that?

524
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Maybe

525
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Is that to encourage people to actually go outside and wait in line or what?

526
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Well, they didn't know that this was going to happen

527
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This was just something that they did

528
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I mean, if they said, hey, by the way, we're going to give away free 46 inch TVs

529
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Everyone would have been there

530
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It would have been like the opening of an Ikea

531
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
When Ikea's open, everybody knows

532
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The first people in line get huge certificates

533
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And suddenly the lines are around the block

534
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah

535
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Well, that's interesting, though

536
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That they didn't announce that

537
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Because why wouldn't they announce it

538
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And get the long lines for the media to photograph

539
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So they can go, hey, look how popular the PS3 is in Europe

540
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Even though they had to wait six months for it

541
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But here's the thing, though

542
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
If they did something like that, they'd be like, yeah, but it's only because you're giving away free TVs

543
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I mean, it's not because of the PlayStation 3

544
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And they would have just spun it that way

545
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I think this is just kissing ass

546
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's a whole lot of kissing ass

547
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It's like, please don't be mad at us that we waited so long

548
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And you have to pay more for a system that actually does less

549
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Please don't be mad

550
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Joshi16 says, Sony was eating crayons

551
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
They weren't eating crayons

552
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
They were just kissing ass

553
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That's all it was

554
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Now, GS68 says, doesn't free stuff, bundles with something up the price

555
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But you're saying these are absolutely free TVs

556
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That they gave away to the first

557
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Absolutely free

558
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Is it the UK Retailer London store?

559
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I think so

560
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It was where they were doing their launch event

561
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Where the Sony president would be heading out the first PS3 type thing

562
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Something like that

563
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I don't know

564
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Anyways, along the lines of that

565
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
The UK Retailer game

566
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,000
They were quoted as saying that they were very happy with the amount of supply and demand that they had for the console

567
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And it was actually the first time that they were actually able to fulfill all the demand in short term

568
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
So that's something that's never happened before

569
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Sony withheld the release of the PS3 in order to build up stock levels for the launch

570
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The situation with the Xbox 360 was terrible

571
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And the Wii doesn't even hit the sides when it comes in

572
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I think it's a very good move on Sony's part, it won't have that negativity of not being able to supply enough units

573
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So that's good that they're able to supply enough units

574
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I don't know if that's really an issue though

575
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I think the demand is just less for it

576
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Cool that they have enough units out there

577
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Unfortunately though

578
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And it kind of gets into that whole demand thing

579
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Because outside of the launch event

580
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It wasn't so pretty for Sony

581
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
In fact, there was a few situations where you only had a few people lining up for the system and no one cared

582
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
For example, Virgin Megastore

583
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
They had some campers outside

584
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But it was really only about three or so people that were waiting in line for the system

585
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And a lot of other stores, there were some situations where they were breaking street in Italy and stuff like that

586
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And there's also stuff where people were just not coming in pre-ordering or even buying the system at all

587
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So a lot of people said, who cares at this point

588
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I don't know, so it's kind of negative a little bit

589
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
What do you think made the UK folks not want to line up for it?

590
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Do you think it was because of what happened over here?

591
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Do you think maybe they just don't get excited like this?

592
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Although I seem to think that I remember the UK folks were lining up for the Wii and everything

593
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
They don't want to line up for it because it costs too much and it's a stupid system

594
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
There you go

595
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Why? Why is it a stupid system?

596
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Because it has no games on it

597
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It has everything you can get on the 360 except resistance

598
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
But Gundam!

599
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Jokes

600
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And the only thing cool about the PS3 is that stupid home thing that's coming out this summer or fall or whatever and I want that

601
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But other than that, it's stupid

602
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Yeah, I think it's a little bit what Shane said, maybe not so harsh

603
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It's not a lot of games out there right now

604
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Not a lot of exclusive stuff that's really must have

605
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's really one of those systems that maybe it's better off to wait when the price comes down a little bit and there's more of a library

606
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Also, they were kind of getting shafted for a while

607
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
A lot of people that were waiting the six months or whatever

608
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Not six months

609
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Four months

610
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Three months to get the system

611
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Probably say, hey, you know what?

612
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Maybe 360 is a little bit better

613
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Maybe I should just pick this up now

614
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Because I can get it now and there's a big library of games out there

615
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Or get the Wii

616
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Making them wait for a while

617
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
If they're really itching to get their grasp of the new game systems

618
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
They're just going to go someplace else and get something that's out now

619
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I don't know

620
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
They're really having a hard time distinguishing themselves as why you need this system

621
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So that's one thing

622
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The UK didn't have the only problems with launches

623
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Australia, the launch wasn't very great over there

624
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
In fact, their launch event only drew about 40 people

625
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I had read that a lot of these launch events were getting cancelled

626
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Because of the fear of gunshots and all the crap that happened here

627
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I didn't hear too many of that

628
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But I know the ones that they were talking about in Australia

629
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
They had about maybe 40 people show up

630
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Another 30 that were press

631
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And it was pretty much like kind of

632
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I don't know, just people weren't really excited about it

633
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I don't know if it's just because not a lot of people were pre-ordering them

634
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Or just no one really wanted them

635
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Rice Princess, you'd want to comment earlier but got cut off

636
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I know, I was just going to say they're all busy playing Wii bowling

637
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
They're too busy to go stand out in line and wait for Sony?

638
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yeah, because they're playing a good system

639
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Because they're playing Wii bowling, okay

640
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Would you have camped out for this?

641
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
No

642
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Let's say you had the money

643
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Let's say you had 600 euros, dollars, whatever right now

644
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Would you go camp out?

645
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
No, because I probably already have a Wii

646
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And I don't have a desire to have a PS3

647
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'd be spending my time on the Wii

648
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I've got a question for you

649
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You've been very vocal about your hate for Xbox on this show previously

650
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Would you buy an Xbox at this point before Playstation 3?

651
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
If I had?

652
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
In terms of if I had to

653
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Because obviously I wouldn't buy it on my own

654
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But if I had to

655
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Probably

656
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I probably would

657
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Huh, that's a very interesting thing

658
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Miklotov wants to comment, he's dying over there

659
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Why would they be playing Wii bowling?

660
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Because the Wii sucks

661
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I don't like it

662
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Wait a minute, wait so you hate the Wii and the Playstation 3?

663
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Yes, I like the 360

664
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I seem to recall though on this program you were very excited about the Wii

665
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I was

666
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
When did this change in heart happen?

667
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Well it was when Nintendo decided that they were too good to release games anymore

668
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And I don't want to play crappy games

669
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And that's all they've been giving us lately

670
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You do this all the time though, to be fair

671
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I distinctly remember you sold your Xbox 360 back for the same reason

672
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
How many PS2's have I had?

673
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
When Final Fantasy 11 came out you bought a new one eventually

674
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Because you were like, ooh I have to be a corsair because they're pretty

675
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I mean, have you sold your Wii back at this point?

676
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
No, but my Wii has been broken since I got it

677
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And I have my little return sticker for Nintendo

678
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I need to call and get a new one actually

679
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But I have no desire to send it back because

680
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
What am I going to play on it right now?

681
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Sell it, I mean seriously you can sell it

682
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
They're going for a lot of money right now because they can't find them

683
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And people want them

684
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
So if you don't want yours, might as well sell it

685
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But at the end of the year you're going to get your Mario Galaxy

686
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Your Metroid, you're going to want one anyway

687
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I have no desire for Mario Galaxy thanks to Sunshine

688
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But Metroid, yeah, Smash Brothers, yeah

689
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Maybe they'll have another color by then

690
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm a color whore anyway

691
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I want something you'll talk about later

692
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Let's see

693
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Let's see

694
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Let's see

695
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Joshi16 says the exact same thing happened on the DS, don't act surprised

696
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
What, the

697
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Oh, I was thinking the color changes, like yeah

698
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But oh, the lack of games

699
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Lack of games

700
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah, but you know what, I could play some good games on like

701
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
From Game Boy Advance

702
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I could play GameCube games on this and not be fulfilled

703
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Because GameCube games aren't that good either

704
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Blaze says die, Miklotov die

705
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You can die too

706
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Tetsuya says Miklotov's Wii's been broken

707
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Which SakuraMax follows right up with

708
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Don't worry, Mama will fix it

709
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
That's creepy and so quit talking please

710
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
For the record

711
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
If you listen to last week's program I was all excited about playing Cookie Mama this week

712
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I went to Toys R Us today to try to get it when I bought Tetris

713
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Because I had something to take back so I had a credit there anyway

714
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And they told me it didn't come out until next week

715
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It came out last week

716
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
They're retarded

717
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
They're just lying to me, to my face

718
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yeah, they have old information or their shipments didn't come in

719
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Bitch!

720
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It's not, it was not something that was delayed

721
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's been out there

722
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I've heard the games being crap reviews anyway

723
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm a little worried

724
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I saw it, let me put it this way, I saw Blockbuster yesterday

725
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
So I know it's out there, I don't know

726
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
It just, I looked at it and I'm like

727
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Mama needs to fix her shipping dates, that's what she needs to fix

728
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm like, I'm not even going to rent this

729
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
No thank you

730
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I know I'm going to buy it because I'm dumb

731
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Cookie Mama on the Wii

732
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh my god, that looks so great, I want it

733
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But it's been getting negative reviews everywhere

734
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It looks great but it controls like crap

735
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Why would you be excited for it?

736
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Because you're a woman and you do that already

737
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But not on a DS

738
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
On a Wii, stupid!

739
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Or on a Wii, shut up

740
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's really disappointing that it controls like crap

741
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Because I was hoping that it would be, it looked fun

742
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And the DS one looked fun too

743
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It's just, well there were some control issues

744
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And it really, that frustrates the hell out of you

745
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
More comments from chat, I'm really relying on chat tonight

746
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Because I have not been reading the internet this week

747
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Zappy says the original Cookie Mama got bad reviews too

748
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Because it had control issues

749
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It has control issues

750
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Let's see, Skylark makes a good point

751
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And says, luckily Super Paper Mario comes out in a few weeks

752
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
What, you're booing Super Paper Mario, Mikotov?

753
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
The crap, what's wrong with Super Paper Mario, it looks great

754
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I don't like it because it is a Paper Mario title

755
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And I don't like Paper Mario games

756
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And I know it's a freaking platformer game

757
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But I'm sick of platformers

758
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And I hate everything, so there

759
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Well you heard about the Power Rangers game that's coming out

760
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Just kidding, I got you

761
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Sucker!

762
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Blaze wanted to point out, Mikotov just won my love back, lol

763
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
No one makes Power Rangers games anymore

764
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And GS68 says Cooking Milf

765
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Maybe that'll be the sequel, Cooking Milf

766
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That's wrong

767
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Something else is wrong

768
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Is removing the Emotion Engine out of the Playstation 3

769
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
To cut down costs

770
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Granted, okay, I will give them this

771
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It does now, they have with the new version 1.6 firmware

772
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
The original Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games

773
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Actually I think more Playstation 2

774
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Are emulated now with the Emotion

775
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Like kind of a software emulation instead of hardware

776
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
So of the 2,451 Playstation 2 titles in the European region

777
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Only 1,782 titles work

778
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Which to be honest though

779
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
That's a lot better than the 360

780
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That is a lot better than the 360

781
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Of course, what does that really mean?

782
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Because that's a lot of titles

783
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But maybe it's a lot of barbie horse adventures type stuff

784
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Really how much of this stuff am I going to want to play

785
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And which games are working, not working, etc.

786
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And I'm trying to remember here

787
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I want to say of the list that they were saying that weren't working

788
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I want to say Final Fantasy VII, Resident Evil 2, Ratchet and Clank, Metal Gear Solid 2

789
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Those are some of the PS1 games that weren't working

790
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And let's see, big name issues

791
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
There was 550 of the games that had noticeable issues

792
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
According to Sony

793
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Among the big name titles like Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider 2 on the Playstation 1

794
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Final Fantasy X, Kingdom Hearts, Sing Star, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas on the Playstation 2

795
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Those are all ones that didn't work

796
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Those are all ones that had noticeable issues

797
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Lame

798
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
To be fair though

799
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
1700 titles for your system that are backwards compatible

800
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
A lot better than over 300 for the 360

801
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I guess that's true

802
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
They're working on it

803
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So give them some credit, that's a lot more than I was expecting to work with the system

804
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
They're doing something right at least

805
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But I still think it's kind of crappy that it's software emulation now

806
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Who cares though, I have one of the original Playstation 3's and it plays on hardware emulation

807
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So who cares

808
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Pardon me for a minute, I have a sidebar issue completely unrelated to take care of

809
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Why is it when I got up to sneak to go use the bathroom

810
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The magic of radio I can get up and leave and you don't even know

811
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But yet I noticed in chat I suddenly said I'm Rob, I'm so flamey blah blah blah

812
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Wow Rob you're amazing

813
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm going to let you take a guess who said that

814
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Yeah it was probably Miklotov

815
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You're probably right

816
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
They're pointing back and forth at each other

817
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You guys are jerks

818
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Banned from the show forever

819
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It was funny though

820
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
With the Playstation 1.6 firmware for the Playstation 3

821
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You got some other stuff

822
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Not just some backwards compatibility

823
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Wait hold on I want to comment on the whole backwards compatibility thing

824
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
It sucks

825
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
That's all

826
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Well here's the thing

827
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
What else is there to say

828
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I don't know it's weird

829
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But at the same time I do feel like if you're going to buy a Playstation 3

830
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You know I called in to All Games Radio very randomly on Tuesday or Wednesday

831
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
One of the days before I leave to talk about this

832
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And I kind of made a little joke

833
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Because I don't know they were doing something on there

834
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
They were joking that the whole cast of OLR was at the Sony factory doing backwards compatibility

835
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Don't ask I don't remember what it was

836
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So I called in pretending to be at the Sony factory

837
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I made this little joke about

838
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
If you're going to buy a Playstation 3 to play all your old Playstation 2 games

839
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Maybe you ought to save $400 fucking dollars and buy a Playstation 2

840
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Right fair

841
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So I don't know why

842
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
At one point I do want to go well that kind of sucks

843
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
You can't play all your old games

844
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
But seeing as the system doesn't really upscale it yet

845
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Like it was supposed to right

846
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Actually the software emulation will allow it to upscale

847
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So that is good

848
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
But it's not that big a deal

849
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It's not that big a deal

850
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It's not going to suddenly make your games HD beautiful blah blah blah

851
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It's just going to be a little bit smoother

852
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Honestly ask yourself

853
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I mean really if you've got a Playstation 3

854
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And you're really gearing to play some next gen games

855
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Are you really playing Playstation 1 games?

856
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm not I have Playstation 2 games

857
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I have a Playstation 2 as well

858
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't touch the thing

859
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I don't play any of those games

860
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm playing new stuff

861
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
If I really want to go back and play Kingdom Hearts 2 or whatever

862
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'll play it on my Playstation 2

863
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I mean Playstation 2's are still selling really well

864
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Exactly

865
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
They're sort of readily available out there

866
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And they're not that expensive

867
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And they'll probably drop in price again

868
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Once we get down to Christmas time again

869
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
At the same time though

870
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I do get a little irritated

871
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Like when Xbox 360 talks about how they're going to abandon

872
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Pretty much the old Xbox stuff come 2008

873
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I think we had a story on that last week

874
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And I know people go

875
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Well why don't you just play it on your old Xbox blah blah blah blah

876
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
But I don't know

877
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Sometimes I don't feel like cooking

878
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I don't feel like cooking the game systems

879
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So it is kind of convenient sometimes to be able to do the backwards compatibility thing

880
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It is

881
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And it's a nice thing that they've added

882
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I mean since I think was it

883
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
The Playstation 2 was the first system to actually do that

884
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And it was a great selling point

885
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It plays all your Playstation 1 games

886
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It actually makes them run a little bit better

887
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You can do better graphics or you know

888
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Better load times

889
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So that was kind of cool

890
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Which I might add

891
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Playstation 3 load times kind of suck on certain games

892
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
If you were going to install it through the hard drive that would be really nice

893
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
But either way

894
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's still

895
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I would say though

896
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
1700 games working for your system is a lot better than 300

897
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Okay

898
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
That's something that they've got

899
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But the Xbox did not have as big of a library as the Playstation 2

900
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Because they didn't have anything before Xbox

901
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Microsoft didn't compete with Playstation 1

902
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And really I'm hoping that they do stick on

903
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
You know

904
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The backwards compatibility instead of just saying

905
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Ah fuck it you know we got this mini to work so

906
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
That's it

907
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
We're done

908
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
SSJ100Matt says it's funny that Microsoft killed the Xbox One right away

909
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 are still around

910
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I don't know so much about Playstation 1

911
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
But certainly Playstation 2 still got quite a bit of life

912
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It seems left in it

913
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Oh yeah

914
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I don't know if God of War 2 is like it's last gasp of air

915
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Or if that's going to be the last big game

916
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
That may be the last Sony game

917
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
That may be the last games throughout the year

918
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
That are coming out for the Playstation 2

919
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And I'm sure we'll get Sudoku Master for years to come

920
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
On Playstation 2

921
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I played a lot of Sudoku

922
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
When you don't have a PSP or a DS

923
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It's all about Sudoku

924
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It's cheap to develop for

925
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
That's what it is

926
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's the one system that has the largest user base out there

927
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Over three times of what the 360 has

928
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And of course they're going to still make games for it

929
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I mean 30 million people have the damn system

930
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It would be dumb not to make games for it

931
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
But I mean certain games like the new Ghost Recon games

932
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And stuff like that

933
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You just can't do them on the Playstation 2

934
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You've got to cut your costs

935
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Either make the next gen version look pretty

936
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Or just skip the current gen one

937
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Maybe do something like EA is doing

938
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Like Medal of Honor Vanguard for the Wii and Playstation 2

939
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And then make a new one

940
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Medal of Honor Airborne

941
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
For the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360

942
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
That way everybody's happy

943
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And they've saved their costs a little bit on the games

944
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That don't necessarily need the huge graphic budgets

945
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And stuff like that

946
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Let me quickly go to another sidebar comment

947
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And then we'll get back into the news here

948
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
The comments from the chat room

949
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
This is an interesting conversation

950
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
JVmon says, if you have a Playstation 3

951
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Why the hell are you still playing Final Fantasy 7?

952
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And then ShadowNextGen says, JVmon Final Fantasy 7 is a classic

953
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That I will always play

954
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And then moving on

955
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Let's see, JVmon says then play it on your Playstation 2

956
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And Hippolytus says this

957
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
He says, I for example never owned a Playstation

958
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I think he means PS1

959
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
But now that I have a Playstation 2

960
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I can play Playstation 1 games

961
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But that begs the comment

962
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
How many people do you know that's actually going to go get a Playstation 3

963
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Who never had a Playstation 2?

964
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
But I do know of one person

965
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I do have a friend who's considering getting a Playstation 3

966
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And he never had a Playstation 2 or a Playstation 1

967
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
He's thinking about getting it

968
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Because he can play all the backwards compatible stuff

969
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
In this country you still can

970
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
If this is a big concern for them

971
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I would recommend that they do

972
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
And it's going to be a different SKU

973
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Or a slightly different item

974
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Not item member

975
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
They're Sony item members

976
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Either way, you're going to be able to look on the box

977
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And tell which version of the Playstation 3 this is

978
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
The one that has

979
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
One of the original launch ones

980
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Or one of the ones that got the

981
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
65 nanometer chips in them

982
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And it's software emulation now

983
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So if it's a real big concern for your backwards compatibility

984
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Make sure you get one of the older ones

985
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And that's all you really need to do

986
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Or buy an older one that's used or something

987
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I'd recommend that's the case

988
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Because really it's going to drop in price

989
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Probably in the fall

990
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I mean they probably will need to

991
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Especially if Microsoft drops their price

992
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
But the thing is

993
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
That it's going to come at a cost

994
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
You're not going to have that chip on there

995
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And they've already said they're going to take it out

996
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
For the US ones

997
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So if it's a real big deal for you

998
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Maybe spend the extra money

999
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I mean it's either that or you're going to spend another

1000
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
$99 on a Playstation 2

1001
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
So pick your poison

1002
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I mean this way you get a larger hard drive

1003
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
With it at the same time

1004
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
You can buy a more expensive system or something

1005
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I don't know

1006
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Anyways

1007
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
So back to the Playstation 3 1.6

1008
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Oh firmware that's out there

1009
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Finally they've added

1010
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Background downloading

1011
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Something that they should have had from the beginning

1012
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Because this thing downloads like

1013
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Fucking slow

1014
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Well to be fair 360 didn't have it at first

1015
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It badly needed it too

1016
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But I would have hoped that since

1017
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
The Playstation 3 came out a year later

1018
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That they would kind of learn from

1019
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I'll give you that

1020
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Either way so now it does work

1021
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And it is confirmed that it will work

1022
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
While you're watching a blu-ray movie

1023
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Or playing an offline game

1024
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Not an online game

1025
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Basically the same rules as a 360

1026
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So that's kind of cool

1027
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Another thing

1028
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Well and also kind of another thing

1029
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Why would you really need background downloading

1030
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Because there's not a lot to download on the store right now

1031
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So anyways

1032
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Another thing that does add

1033
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And this is kind of neat

1034
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Is that folding at home

1035
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
That basically the kind of program

1036
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
That runs in the background to help

1037
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Crunch numbers to figure out

1038
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
How to come up with cures for diseases and whatnot

1039
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Interesting enough

1040
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
This was released this week

1041
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
The firmware update

1042
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And already the Playstation 3

1043
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Is processing a lot more

1044
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Numbers than anything else

1045
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
In fact even more than

1046
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Most of the Windows PC's out there

1047
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Right now they are currently

1048
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Doing what was it

1049
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
251 teraflops

1050
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Which you know that's

1051
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
100 trillion

1052
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
More than

1053
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
They were saying that

1054
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
The Playstation 3 machines are delivering

1055
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Over 251 trillion

1056
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Floating point operations per second

1057
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
100 trillion more than

1058
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
10 times the number of

1059
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Active PC CPU's

1060
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Is this folding at home thing

1061
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Forgive my ignorance a little bit

1062
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Because I don't have a Playstation 3 so I haven't been really following this very much

1063
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
But is this something that you

1064
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
It automatically kind of stealth installs in your Playstation 3

1065
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And just runs without you knowing it

1066
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I think you have to download this

1067
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Or it's basically a

1068
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I'm not sure if it's included with the update

1069
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
If it is included with the update it's a program you have to run

1070
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It runs almost like a screen saver

1071
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And it will crunch numbers

1072
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
But yet for a PC

1073
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
You would have to elect to download this

1074
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And kind of seek it out right

1075
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Yes but the thing is though you have to run it

1076
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
In order for it to actually run

1077
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's not something that will run automatically

1078
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
So

1079
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Kind of like distributed net

1080
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Because I used to run that back in college

1081
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's basically like the old study at home

1082
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Little cow icon

1083
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Except you know now instead of searching

1084
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
For extraterrestrial life

1085
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Because I guess they gave up on that

1086
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Instead of that they're looking to

1087
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
You know

1088
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Cure cancer

1089
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I can't wait for the press release

1090
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
When one of these Playstation 3's

1091
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Happens to crunch the magical number

1092
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
To cure cancer

1093
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Sony cures cancer

1094
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I mean I can see that PR right now

1095
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Joshi16 in chat says

1096
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Cure cancer

1097
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
1000 gamer points and a home trophy

1098
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
There you go

1099
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Yeah I want the cure cancer trophy

1100
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Anyways

1101
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
On to a completely different system and subject

1102
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
This rumor of the

1103
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Black Xbox 360 just will never die

1104
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And it's now confirmed to be real

1105
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Probably why the rumor never died

1106
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
And the latest issue of Game Informer magazine

1107
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Which further goes to show

1108
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Microsoft rumors 90% of the time

1109
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Unless you made it up yourself

1110
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Microsoft rumors are always true

1111
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Always true

1112
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It has been announced at least through

1113
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
According to the article in Game Informer

1114
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Not officially announced yet but anyways

1115
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
An HDMI enabled black unit

1116
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Is coming out for $479

1117
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
It's going to be a limited edition

1118
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
In black it will be in white later

1119
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
But limited edition for

1120
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Yeah $479

1121
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And

1122
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
It's supposed to have a larger hard drive

1123
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
120 gigabytes

1124
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And other rumored options with this

1125
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Is that it's supposed to also have black accessories

1126
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Coming out for it

1127
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So eventually you'll see different colored controllers and whatnot

1128
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And one thing also they were talking about

1129
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Is the IPTV is supposed to be enabled in it as well

1130
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So that's something interesting

1131
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
If you've already spent the money though

1132
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
On your 360

1133
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You'll be happy to know there will be a larger hard drive

1134
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Coming out for under $200

1135
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
And the other rumor with that is

1136
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
That there is going to be a data cable included with the new 360

1137
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And a new hard drive that will allow you to be able to hook up your old hard drive

1138
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
To transfer any saves you have

1139
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So I hope that's true

1140
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Well Microsoft rumors usually end up being true

1141
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So that would make sense

1142
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
But interesting

1143
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I don't know I can't get too excited about the black Xbox 360

1144
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Because I think well the first Xbox was black and nobody cared

1145
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Well it's going to be called the elite

1146
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I mean that's what they're calling it right now

1147
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
The core system is not going away

1148
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
The premium system is not going away

1149
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It's basically this is just going to be another skew that's added on

1150
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And eventually it will become a white system

1151
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I'm not sure if it's going to replace the premium system or not

1152
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
But they're going to eventually all be white

1153
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
So I don't know it's interesting

1154
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Hopefully we'll see a price drop for the core

1155
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Because that would be kind of nice

1156
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I heard they're ditching the core

1157
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I don't know

1158
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I would think they would because they want to urge people to download movies and stuff

1159
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So that means you have to have a hard drive right

1160
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah but at the same time they want to still be able to compete against the Wii and stuff

1161
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I mean they've got to have that lower price point out there

1162
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Drop the premium to $299 there you go

1163
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah that would be good

1164
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I think if they do a price drop to drop it to $299

1165
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
They could keep the core around for like $199 or something like that

1166
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
If they're not going to keep it around then so be it

1167
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
So they'll have a unit that's not out there

1168
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Shadownextgen says a new Xbox 360 hard drive for under $200 equals $199.99

1169
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
If I were to guess actually

1170
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I can't remember because originally the core system

1171
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
It was $299 and the hard drive is $99

1172
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So that would equal $399 roughly

1173
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
This is $479

1174
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So I don't know

1175
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Core system plus new hard drive

1176
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I'm guessing the hard drive is $179.99

1177
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
That would be my guess

1178
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Blaze says Sky new colors always make people go ooooh

1179
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I don't know I kind of like the white because for my setup it's kind of nice

1180
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Because my Ikea TV table is a light color

1181
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And then you have the white Wii on one side and the white Xbox 360 on the other side

1182
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Everything looks nice

1183
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Rob you got to understand though people are stupid and they will buy different colored stuff

1184
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
I can understand for the HDMI cable the bigger hard drive and that stuff

1185
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I don't know I'm not going to get it

1186
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I might get the new hard drive or something if I really need it or something

1187
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
But I don't need the HDMI my TV doesn't have HDMI so that's a big deal

1188
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Black I couldn't give a crap if the thing was bright green or pink or something

1189
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Who cares

1190
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Ravenstaufen wants to know if you've seen this through your insider sources

1191
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Nope because certain companies will not talk about stuff before it needs to be out there

1192
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Certain companies are a little better about keeping tabs on that stuff than others

1193
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony they're an expert in the PR department

1194
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And they will not leak crap like this out there

1195
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
In fact I'm surprised that it would even be out there in some of those system stuff

1196
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Unless they're doing like test stuff I don't know

1197
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But yeah this stuff will not be out there until they want it to be out there

1198
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Anyways

1199
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
So other stuff about that

1200
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Well actually they don't really have anything else other than that

1201
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Hopefully April I mean it's not that far away so

1202
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
If we're going to hear an update about this it's going to be pretty damn soon

1203
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So keep your eyes peeled for an actual press release about this

1204
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And hopefully more exciting stuff to come from

1205
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Does Microsoft have any events coming up in April where they could drop this bombshell

1206
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
No but I think they're getting close to the end of their fiscal year

1207
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
So I don't know

1208
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
That might be good to make boost stock prices or something

1209
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Anyways on to the final new system out there the Wii

1210
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,000
They are getting the final version of the internet channel towards the end of April

1211
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And it's supposed to be having some more features added to it

1212
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I believe they're improving the

1213
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Like getting rid of that goddamn bar that sits at the bottom of your page?

1214
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I hope so I can't remember I have to find the exact details for it

1215
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
But I remember improved zooming auto resizing of text

1216
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I think they're improving the little virtual keyboard that's on there

1217
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So that has like some more preset stuff like www. and html and stuff like that

1218
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So that stuff on there

1219
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Hopefully they're removing the little bar on there

1220
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And I think they're extending the free web browser until June now

1221
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Well that's a nice thing to do considering a lot of people that want to get Wii still can't get them

1222
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:35,000
The web browser is five bucks when they start charging for it

1223
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I don't know I can't see how that would be

1224
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You know the Wii web browser has been getting a little bit of play in this house

1225
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Because we use it for YouTube

1226
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
When there's like seven people over we want to show something funny on YouTube

1227
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Like hey look at this Kelly video on YouTube because you're the only person on the planet that still hasn't seen it

1228
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
We'll go to YouTube and bring it up on the TV and it's kind of cool except for that bar

1229
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
That sits at the bottom of the page and kind of eats up all the space

1230
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Or porno tube

1231
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Or porno tube is also yeah I remember the New Year's party good times

1232
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Good times

1233
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Yes it's a gateway to porn

1234
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Anyways

1235
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Back on the subject of the Wii here

1236
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
EAA announced a brand new game for the Wii called Boogie

1237
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
This was I think we had covered a story

1238
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
They were talking about how there was going to be a 70's style music game coming out for the Wii

1239
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And I believe this is it

1240
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Is this the harmonix partnership?

1241
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
No

1242
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Because there's that going on too right?

1243
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I seem to remember last week there was some sort of from game developers conference

1244
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
EA said we're going to get in bed with harmonix for one game type thing going on

1245
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Is this related?

1246
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I don't think this has anything to do with harmonix

1247
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Alright just curious

1248
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It's basically a Wii exclusive game and you're going to be using the nunchuck as well as the remotes to disco dance

1249
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
And your character kind of looks almost like I don't know definitely not human

1250
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
But there's these evil looking peak men things in the background

1251
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Everybody disco dancing

1252
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So it's interesting what they're doing with that

1253
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Could be kind of fun I don't know

1254
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
So I'm looking forward to it

1255
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
That should be out later this year of course no specific anything

1256
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Still a little vague for me

1257
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I want to know more about like you know were there videos out there of people playing it

1258
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Pictures

1259
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Looks pretty good

1260
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Another thing that was announced or at least reconfirmed

1261
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Guitar Hero for the Wii is supposed to be coming out

1262
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And they're saying that they're going to actually be doing controllers as well that look like guitars

1263
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Not a big surprise

1264
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And yeah kind of going back to when they were talking about

1265
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Wait they're going to make controllers that look like guitars?

1266
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
That's what they were saying

1267
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
But wouldn't that be a given because Guitar Hero uses a guitar controller

1268
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Or are they saying that feasibly you're going to be able to play this game with no special controller

1269
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I think they're actually making new controllers for it

1270
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Because

1271
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Yeah they said it says the Colt rhythm game Guitar Hero is on its way to the Wii it comes with a guitar shaped controller

1272
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And plays convincingly enough to make you think you're making real music

1273
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Hopefully we'll get the actual guitar and not pretend we're up

1274
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So it's speculation never mind

1275
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So no idea if they're going to actually have a real guitar thing

1276
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I would hope that they're going to if they want to cut costs you know

1277
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Just make a plugin for like the Wiimote you know stick it in there

1278
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I mean because the things made to build off of it you know that's why they have that stupid little

1279
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Almost like a USB thing on the bottom for all those attachments

1280
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Build something that works onto it like slide the guitar or the Wiimote into the guitar

1281
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I don't like this whole thinning of the Guitar Hero franchise amongst all the consoles you know

1282
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I already passed on Guitar Hero 2 for Playstation because I knew the 360 version was coming

1283
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And now I don't know I don't know what the Wii version is going to have to really have something special to make me want to buy another guitar controller

1284
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
And another you know I kind of wish they would put out a guitar that would just work on all the systems

1285
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Kind of like you can get DDR pads to do that

1286
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Yeah

1287
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I'll be nice

1288
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Then let's see here have one more story and I think you talked about this a little bit last week Rob

1289
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:27,000
And it's been finally confirmed a Nintendo rep has confirmed individual friends list for the Wii titles

1290
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,000
So yes they have worked they have done nothing to change the fucking hassle that was DS friends list system

1291
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And basically they've said I can confirm that the friend code system in the Wi-Fi connection service for the Wii will be the same as it was for the Nintendo DS

1292
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Meaning game specific friend codes and separate friends rosters are used in each game where players can play with identified friends

1293
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,000
As with the Nintendo DS the system was created to ensure gaming environment is kept fun for everyone

1294
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Except for the people that have to enter in the 5000 codes for each damn game

1295
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Retarded

1296
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I just I don't know I talked about this so I was blue in the face last night I just don't get it

1297
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Rice Brothers you weren't here last week what do you think of this whole friend codes thing on the Wii

1298
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
That you're going to have to basically enter in your friend code every time to get new players

1299
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
What that's dumb

1300
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Like you do on the DS right you know how you do that on the DS you enter a friend code now you have to do the same thing on the Wii

1301
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Even though we already put in friend codes to send the messages back and forth you have to do it for every single game

1302
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Because heaven forbid you get a I don't know a predator on Wii or something

1303
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I hope I hope that these that this is something that's not required for like third parties or something this this could be fun

1304
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I'm fine with the first party stuff if they're doing what they want to do that great but I you know so far with like Konami

1305
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:00,000
They have a little bit so we connect 24 stuff you know I'm I don't know I don't well I guess that's not really playing with anyone online though

1306
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:10,000
That's just exchanging like levels or something so I still think it's retarded though it why would you want to be a friend in one game and not another

1307
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I why it doesn't make any sense no sense whatsoever I don't understand why they have to complicate things

1308
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And I'm sure they got an over you know what was the response to the DS one I mean no one I think actually was positive on it

1309
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Everyone was like this fucking sucks so what would make you decide hmm people really hated it before let's do it again that'd be awesome

1310
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I mean really what was the thought behind this I don't get it

1311
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Maybe there wasn't any thought

1312
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I mean people aren't really being kidnapped with the goddamn DS I mean seriously

1313
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Skylark says friend codes are horrible haven't Nintendo learned anything I'd rather take the risk of meeting child molesters than not be able to play online at all

1314
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And really how hard is it anyways to add someone I mean you just put in a friend code it's basically like accepting like hitting yes or something

1315
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I mean people you they won't people can add you to their friends list but you have to add them back first so it would be just like you know if I send a friend request to somebody they don't have to agree to do it

1316
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
So why just leave it as yes no instead of numbers I don't know why you have to complicate things

1317
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Maury in our chat room live on this Sunday evening at chat.org.com says it's a really flawed system especially considering Nintendo's justification

1318
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Qwhat5565 says Nintendo can't be that stupid they have to be coming out with an easier add-on maybe a report button

1319
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Well I mean here let me put it this way we still got time until the first you know online game comes out this could change before then

1320
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But not really because we've had Elibits and that worked fine but I know you don't play versus or whatever but

1321
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I'm just saying right now though they could change I hope they change it I mean I really do because it's just a pain in the ass it really is

1322
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I'm glad that they want to protect the children out there from you know child molesters and stuff to be honest I don't think you're really gonna have that problem

1323
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Because you don't have video chat you don't really have voice chat you don't have even normal chat it's just fucking exchanging messages back and forth like you know email

1324
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I don't see what the big deal is just just put yes or no I mean is that so hard instead of having to enter and people put their damn friend codes on websites anyways

1325
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
And they exchange them that way so how is that any different than you know yes or no

1326
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:52,000
You know what we should do is create a website childmolesterfriendcodes.com and like encourage you know people to use the friend code systems to meet child molesters

1327
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Obviously I'm joking people but you know I mean Loki brings up a good point you can trade codes online with complete strangers who might turn out to be people you don't expect them to be I don't get it

1328
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I don't get it either because if you know someone ends up being creepy or something you delete their friend code or for example with Xbox Live you just befriend them

1329
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Whoa that's

1330
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Or push the button that reports them it's not that hard although I know a lot of people don't use it

1331
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I mean how hard is it I mean people oh no people are gonna send you like stupid messages oh it's so hard to just delete them I mean

1332
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I just don't understand why they have to make extra hoops to jump through for a system that can be so simple

1333
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Rant rant rant rant rant jumpman says historically Nintendo hasn't been great with new technology look at the virtual boy

1334
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Skylark says how do they honestly think friend codes are a good idea if they do anything they prevent us from playing together totally not we

1335
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Making a little play on that play together line get it GS68 says how to meet child molesters come down to the Silicon Valley area and take the line 22 bus after 10pm

1336
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Well here's the thing it's like okay I have a huge list of friends or whatever that you know I've got in my Wii system right now

1337
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I get you know not that I would actually play Pokemon I get Pokemon battle revolution or something like that great I want to play against my friends

1338
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Oh no wait no I can't do that because I have to email all my damn friends now with the Wii system and say hey what's your friend code for Pokemon battle revolution

1339
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Because I can't play you until you know I get this so it may take me a couple days before I'm actually able to play the game online with friends

1340
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Hooray mission accomplished you've really you know embraced online

1341
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Well I think there's only one thing left to say about all of this

1342
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:57,000
That would be the FUs of the week for the second week in a row inspired by Nintendo friend codes

1343
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
No dark soccer tonight so Loki you get first dibs

1344
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:09,000
My FU goes to drama I hate drama and I hate drama that's unnecessary I'll leave it at that for now

1345
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:20,000
My FU goes to bullies they come in all shapes and sizes and fortune 500 sizes and bullies are not cool

1346
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And double standards suck as well I really hate double standards I really really really really hate when you see one thing applied this way here

1347
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
And then it's applied totally or a blind eye is turned over here I think that's stupid

1348
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
That's all. Rice Princess do you have anything you want to share?

1349
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Well I second both of your FUs but yes so FU to immaturity yes that's pretty much it I'm not going to get into specifics yep

1350
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Oh and one last thing some very vague FUs this week FU to the last Mimsy because it just got ridiculous towards the end really ridiculous

1351
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Some chat room folks are entering honorary FUs on behalf of dark sakura for not being here

1352
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Joshi16 says dark sakura FU to fucking drivers drivers suck I hate them they should die in a fire Kingdom Hearts rules no FU to them

1353
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:28,000
That's great oh drunami says FU to e-sluts on myspace yes amen you know I've been gone for 4 days so I logged into myspace I swear to god 15 e-sluts that is going to kill myspace just like slowness killed fredster it really is

1354
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
It would not be that hard for myspace to institute some way to get around that

1355
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I think they kind of are right now

1356
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Well they have that whole thing where you can know my last name and get around it that way so I'm thinking about putting this big thing on my profile that says my last name is roberts

1357
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:51,000
You know because I've used my fake last name that I use on the radio on myspace profile so that people in my real life I don't want to find me can't find me because they don't know my stage name

1358
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:02,000
So I'm thinking about just putting that really big so that the cam girls are cool and they can't at least shut it off turn it on for a little while and hopefully it will get them to stop hitting my profile I don't know

1359
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Just do what I do robin just not check myspace after you know once every 2 weeks or something because by the time you get back there most of the profiles have been deleted anyways

1360
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I like getting the ads from listeners of the show and things of that you know and people that I you know meet in my real life who I tell how to find my profile and all that stuff

1361
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:33,000
You know I like getting that I don't like having to wait through the cam horse to do it but that's you know there's that all games community site which is pretty rad as well

1362
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Rice Princess you should sign up for that because they talk games on there a lot

1363
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Did you? I don't know well maybe you did it while I've been gone I haven't checked the site in a few days there could have been some great blog posts I don't even know

1364
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I have some game review haikus I have to catch up on for the community site so that's community.allgames.com our buddies over there at all games have set up there their answer to myspace minus the cam horse plus all the gaming chat

1365
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Really? Yes it's good times

1366
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
But I might have to go there

1367
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
You'll probably get a lot of friend ads because OMG a chick

1368
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh ok

1369
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I'm going to go in as a dude

1370
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:18,000
You get a lot of cool people over there it's a good community because all listeners of this show and all games and you know all the other shows that are on allgames.com about the six or seven other indie podcasts they have that are on that network so it's cool

1371
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yeah I'll check it out

1372
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Good times

1373
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Ok Tigerclaw wants to know if I check the games and porn community site as well apparently all games has these two spin off community sites one of them is rhythm nation which is for like music based games and the other one is games and porn

1374
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I've not looked at games and porn yet but rice princess that sounds right up your alley

1375
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It totally is

1376
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
You might have to check that out

1377
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Or just the porn

1378
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
So no more news this segment Loki?

1379
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000

1380
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000

1381
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
