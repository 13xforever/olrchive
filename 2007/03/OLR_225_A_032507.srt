00:00:14,177 --> 00:00:25,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, March 25th, 2007, Black Xbox 360s turn out to be real, Devil May Cry 4 is no longer an exclusive, and an old 80s arcade classic comes to Blu-ray.

2
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:35,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,830
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that video game podcast dedicated...

4
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:38,591
[SPEAKER_03]: TechMasterLoki

5
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,026
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

6
00:01:16,663 --> 00:01:20,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I was all excited, too, because I saw a Doctor Who pinball machine this weekend, which I'll get into a little bit.

7
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:24,488
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but seriously, I was like, oh my gosh, this is like, this is Jamie times two.

8
00:01:24,568 --> 00:01:27,070
[SPEAKER_03]: These are like two of her loves rolled up into one.

9
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, sort of like what I thought of, like, Loki, I've had this thought about you before.

10
00:01:31,573 --> 00:01:37,196
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time I ever went to that restaurant in the Bay Area that serves the slabs of meat, and they served the chicken wrapped in bacon.

11
00:01:37,236 --> 00:01:39,337
[SPEAKER_03]: That made me think of you, because I was like, it's two of Loki's loves.

12
00:01:39,357 --> 00:01:42,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I might add the chicken wrapped in bacon wasn't that great when I had it, so.

13
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear that.

14
00:01:43,956 --> 00:01:47,038
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, we do have a female perspective on tonight's program.

15
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:51,262
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, not that we really need one, but we have one anyway.

16
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:53,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Just teasing to all the ladies out there listening.

17
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:54,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Rice Princess.

18
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everyone.

19
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:57,426
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Miss Rice Princess?

20
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:58,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing well.

21
00:01:58,387 --> 00:01:59,328
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you, Rob?

22
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, pretty good.

23
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:02,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been an interesting week.

24
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:03,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree.

25
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:04,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

26
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:04,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It has.

27
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,960
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were talking about movies before we came in tonight.

28
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,700
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you see this week?

29
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

30
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:10,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Now how was it?

31
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:13,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I read a review in some magazine that said it was absolute crap.

32
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:16,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that magazine's absolute crap because it was so fucking awesome.

33
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:18,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it was fucking epic.

34
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

35
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it better than the old school ones from like the 90s with the ninja rap?

36
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,010
[SPEAKER_04]: They're two different things.

37
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,191
[SPEAKER_04]: That's apples and oranges.

38
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:28,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I loved it and I love the old movies too.

39
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:28,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Chime in, Matt.

40
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:31,976
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

41
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:45,100
[SPEAKER_02]: But I swear, go see it.

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking awesome.

43
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:50,384
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why, they did make... It does tie in with the other three movies.

44
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:54,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do make some changes to the storyline.

45
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:57,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically takes place after everything.

46
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And so April O'Neil's not a reporter anymore.

47
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:04,175
[SPEAKER_02]: And Casey Jones isn't exactly like he was in the other movies.

48
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:05,296
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's fine.

49
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:07,217
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of forgive that when you see it.

50
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:07,798
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

51
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,311
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:37,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very satisfying, and I really suggest just ignore the negative reviews out there for it, because it really is good, and I cannot wait for the sequel.

53
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:40,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you on somebody's payola, like New Line's payola?

54
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:40,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not.

55
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:42,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not on anybody's payroll for this kind of stuff.

56
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:47,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome, and yeah, I would love to see it again.

57
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:56,448
[SPEAKER_02]: It really, there's a lot of parts that even have, you know, I was telling Irene about one scene towards the end of the movie or something, which has to do with my Cage Man song, by the way.

58
00:03:56,849 --> 00:03:57,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

59
00:03:57,828 --> 00:04:01,750
[SPEAKER_02]: That it's just when that scene kicked in, it was like, fuck, yeah, that's awesome.

60
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:08,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So highly, highly recommend this movie, especially if you're a fan of, you know, the original Ninja Turtles movie.

61
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not so much number two and definitely not three.

62
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:14,717
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, even the old series and stuff, it really works.

63
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:19,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like that this is going to be something that kind of jump starts the whole movie series all over again.

64
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:31,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show, because, you know, part of what makes this show so unique, shall we say, is that we always encourage the live interaction with our chat room and the phone calls, which we'll take later.

65
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:34,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLawnRadio.com if you want to join in, if you're listening live on this Sunday night.

66
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:36,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, we have...

67
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:40,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaze from the OL Army says, TMNT was fucking amazing.

68
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:43,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Joshi16 says, one of the turtles is gay.

69
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a gay turtle now?

70
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,001
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a gay turtle in there.

71
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:46,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

72
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:47,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

73
00:04:47,803 --> 00:04:48,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

74
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:51,446
[SPEAKER_03]: WonderDogHerald says, are they really still teenagers at this point?

75
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:53,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, maybe not.

76
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:55,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because they're pretty old by now.

77
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,773
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was kind of thinking, well, maybe teenage for, like, turtles.

78
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:00,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how long turtles live, but, you know.

79
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:02,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've never done that.

80
00:05:02,556 --> 00:05:04,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's, like, dog ears or something like that.

81
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:04,758
[SPEAKER_02]: No, so I don't know.

82
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:17,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, not to, I don't think this is spoiling anything, but they've all like kind of, I guess, taken on like responsibilities or have like moved on past like how they used to live before.

83
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:21,010
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's kind of showing that they've like grown up a little bit, but I don't know.

84
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,492
[SPEAKER_04]: They still, I guess their mentality is still kind of like a teenage mentality.

85
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:25,874
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of adult humor in it, which is great.

86
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:27,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of funny stuff.

87
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:28,957
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just awesome.

88
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:29,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean,

89
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:33,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if anyone's going to see it, obviously it doesn't have to do a shredder anymore.

90
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,205
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of after all that.

91
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:36,046
[SPEAKER_02]: They defeated them.

92
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,827
[SPEAKER_02]: The Foot Clan's kind of been disbanded a little bit, or at least they've gone underground.

93
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:48,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's kind of what they've done since then that kind of went on with their lives is because now they don't have to really protect New York from anything.

94
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:50,672
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just kind of living.

95
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they have to kind of come together and, you know,

96
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,861
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really awesome.

97
00:05:57,961 --> 00:06:03,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the opening scene where they're showing kind of that flashback with the battle and stuff, that was awesome.

98
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:05,045
[SPEAKER_02]: That was great.

99
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:09,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I was like, oh my god, this movie's going to be cool.

100
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,229
[SPEAKER_02]: It never let you down at all.

101
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:21,735
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a little bit of humor from the show because they were kind of, you know, Michelangelo of course is still goofy and stuff, but it wasn't detracting and it fit.

102
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:23,256
[SPEAKER_02]: It fit with the characters and

103
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:28,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just really glad they kind of respected the actual characters and didn't make it so...

104
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:29,629
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

105
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know, like I'm all, did like some Chinese dude like those boys?

106
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:01,593
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he sounded Jewish.

107
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:02,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

108
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:03,094
[SPEAKER_01]: You think so?

109
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:04,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, wow.

110
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:06,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, Turtles.

111
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:08,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, seriously, it was kind of weird.

112
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:10,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, alright, we could talk movies all night.

113
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Did any of you guys play the games yet?

114
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,640
[SPEAKER_03]: The new Turtles games?

115
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the old one on Netflix.

116
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:16,083
[SPEAKER_02]: That and like the movie did kind of suck.

117
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:22,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's get into a little bit of how was your gaming week where we talk about the video games that we've been playing this week here on the program.

118
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:23,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess, what have you been playing?

119
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:25,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

120
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:29,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I have actually not played anything.

121
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:34,407
[SPEAKER_04]: This week, like I said before, I canceled my WoW account for the time being.

122
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:34,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouch.

123
00:07:35,107 --> 00:07:39,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of have been not doing, I've been like doing stuff around the house.

124
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you watch anyone play something that looked cool that you wanted to have?

125
00:07:44,112 --> 00:07:45,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, you know what I played?

126
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:46,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I played DDR.

127
00:07:46,753 --> 00:07:47,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

128
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:47,734
[SPEAKER_03]: In the arcade.

129
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:48,614
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go, there's something.

130
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so the first time in like two years.

131
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,256
[SPEAKER_04]: It was awesome.

132
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:53,517
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Supernova, Extreme.

133
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:58,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Supernova and I played a little bit of, whatever is that golf line?

134
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:58,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

135
00:07:59,258 --> 00:07:59,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Earth Defense Force 2017

136
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:28,142
[SPEAKER_02]: It is awesome.

137
00:08:28,362 --> 00:08:35,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so stupid and so ridiculous, and the voice acting is so horrible, but it's so fun to play.

138
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, basically, at least... I know nothing about this game.

139
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:39,188
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this?

140
00:08:39,248 --> 00:08:45,251
[SPEAKER_02]: It is basically these aliens come and start attacking Earth, and it is so B-movie cheesy and stuff.

141
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for example... Like, destroy all humans?

142
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:48,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Not exactly.

143
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:51,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we're talking, like, robots and giant ants.

144
00:08:51,335 --> 00:08:53,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's giant ants.

145
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:56,438
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're fighting for the first few levels is giant ants.

146
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,121
[SPEAKER_02]: and it works.

147
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:02,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in Final Fantasy you fight giant slimes to level up.

148
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:07,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but still though, I mean, it's giant ants and the voice acting is so horrible.

149
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:12,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, they're all, look, it's flying, or look at those alien spaceships.

150
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,564
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like something out of the science fiction movie.

151
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:17,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a science fiction movie, the science fiction movie.

152
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:20,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the one and only that's ever been made.

153
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:21,626
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um...

154
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's just, I can't stop playing.

155
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:28,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you have, you can collect up to 200 weapons in this game.

156
00:09:28,415 --> 00:09:33,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And by replaying the levels over and over, you can level up your characters or whatever, get your stamina higher.

157
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:36,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually, you can play it through five different difficulty levels.

158
00:09:36,962 --> 00:09:40,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing it through, like, Normal and Easy, and even Normal's starting to get hard now.

159
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:46,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing it on Hard, which is not even all the way up to, like, they have, like, Extreme and Inferno or something.

160
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard is fucking impossible, so Inferno's gotta be...

161
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:52,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

162
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,960
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty fun, though.

163
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:59,422
[SPEAKER_02]: It's two-player co-op, which is kind of cool, split-screen.

164
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:01,842
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really looking forward to playing that at work.

165
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:03,563
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just so cheesy, though.

166
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:05,704
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really worth picking up.

167
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:07,825
[SPEAKER_02]: The achievements are not easy in it.

168
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:12,746
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically beating the game on each difficulty and unlocking every single weapon.

169
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:13,727
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your achievements.

170
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:16,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Six achievements for 1,000 points.

171
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:20,449
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's one of those games, though, you have infinite ammo.

172
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:23,330
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have some weird weapons that are in the game.

173
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,031
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, there's one missile that I unlocked in the very beginning.

174
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:26,832
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a piece of shit.

175
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:29,553
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the slowest moving missile I've ever seen.

176
00:10:29,893 --> 00:10:32,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the thing is going, like, less than five miles an hour.

177
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:35,877
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just crawling across the air and doesn't hardly do any damage.

178
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:40,880
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's fun because you can pick, you know, one of two weapons to use throughout the whole game.

179
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,082
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just select your weapons, play your mission, and that's it.

180
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:46,404
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best part about it, though, you can blow up everything.

181
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:47,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Buildings, doesn't matter.

182
00:10:47,684 --> 00:10:48,685
[SPEAKER_02]: No one gives a crap because...

183
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,142
[SPEAKER_02]: You're saving the Earth.

184
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:51,443
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do I do?

185
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:55,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I just start launching random missiles into every single skyscraper I see and watching them all fall.

186
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's entertaining because they're there at the next level because there's no continuity whatsoever.

187
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:01,355
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's awesome.

188
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,336
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you recommend the game?

189
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:03,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly recommend the game.

190
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:04,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you.

191
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The frame rate's crap, the graphics suck, the sound is awful, and the voice acting's horrible.

192
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:12,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And the AI is pretty retarded as well.

193
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:15,104
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you saying it's so bad it's good?

194
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:15,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

195
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:17,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the showgirls of video games?

196
00:11:18,105 --> 00:11:20,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so bad, but that's the thing.

197
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:23,807
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to play it realizing that it's going to suck in these areas.

198
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:25,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, the graphics don't need to be that great.

199
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:27,108
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an old arcade game.

200
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:32,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, old arcade games, there's not that many polygons and stuff, but it works.

201
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just fun to play.

202
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:35,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It may look like crap.

203
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:38,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be very fucking hard at times.

204
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:47,225
[SPEAKER_02]: The AI can be dumb, because I saw some soldier or whatever that was... I was trying to find these people, so they would join me and help kill the alien ants.

205
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:52,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy was shooting a shotgun into a building, because he was stupid and couldn't figure out how to get around the building.

206
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,332
[SPEAKER_02]: So... That's awesome.

207
00:11:55,572 --> 00:11:55,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

208
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:59,736
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... It's funny, but it's still a lot of fun to play.

209
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:00,216
[SPEAKER_02]: It just...

210
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:02,903
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not stop getting fun.

211
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,125
[SPEAKER_02]: So really highly recommend this game.

212
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:09,267
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only like $40 for the 360, so definitely worth picking up.

213
00:12:09,488 --> 00:12:11,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you can find it used, that's even better.

214
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:13,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So I recommend it.

215
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,131
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of fun.

216
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a lot better than from what I've heard for Armored Core 4.

217
00:12:18,273 --> 00:12:20,355
[SPEAKER_02]: And other than that, I played Crackdown a little bit.

218
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:22,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about it, though.

219
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:25,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really... I've been just trying to get the last few achievements and stuff.

220
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:30,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of getting a little bored of the game, because now that you're at the end of the game and stuff, there's not much to do.

221
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, we've been playing that.

222
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:41,029
[SPEAKER_02]: At work, we put custom firmwares in all of our PSPs now, so we're all playing it overclocked, which is fun.

223
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:42,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually looks a lot nicer.

224
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:49,851
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a guy that's working this... Actually, he's a pretty famous cheat designer for the Vice City Stories, DurkaDurkaman.

225
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:54,713
[SPEAKER_02]: He's working on a multiplayer code to switch out some of the weapons and get some different stuff.

226
00:12:54,733 --> 00:13:00,574
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully that'll happen, and I am so looking forward to this week when the Grand Theft Auto 4 trailer hits on Friday.

227
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,820
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

228
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Only been playing two things.

229
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:25,797
[SPEAKER_01]: World of Warcraft.

230
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:27,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I made my alternate character.

231
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:31,499
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Agathon and his pet is named Helo.

232
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:32,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh, that's awesome.

233
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm a big Battlestar nerd now because it's so good.

234
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,100
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so good.

235
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,941
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best and Helo's hot.

236
00:13:40,641 --> 00:13:43,822
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other than that, finally at work.

237
00:13:44,465 --> 00:13:46,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for being at a developer place.

238
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:53,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing a lot of Boom Boom Rocket, and it's the best game I've ever played in my life called Boom Boom Rocket.

239
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:55,369
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty, and I love it.

240
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:56,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how to take that.

241
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:58,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best game you've ever played in your life called that.

242
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:04,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I could say Big Mother Truckers was the best game I ever played in my life named Big Mother Truckers.

243
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:06,353
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lie, because it wasn't a good game at all.

244
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:13,297
[SPEAKER_01]: But Boom Boom Rocket, you know, if I didn't have a 360, would sell me on a 360 because it's really just that much fun.

245
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:14,057
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is it?

246
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:15,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I still don't know that much about it.

247
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,461
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like... Are you allowed to tell us what's... I won't mention specifics.

248
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:19,982
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

249
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:21,002
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not our game.

250
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:21,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

251
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:22,303
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

252
00:14:25,425 --> 00:14:48,247
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a music game with fireworks, so it's like Fantavision meets DDR with a touch of Beatmania, because the fireworks, you know, they make noise for Beatmania, and if you hit arrows when you're not supposed to, it penalizes you like Beatmania does as well, so you can't just mess around, but the track list is not stellar, but it gets the job done, and

253
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:53,051
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like Fantavision and you like pretty things, it's really, really fun.

254
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:54,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of explosions.

255
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:55,652
[SPEAKER_01]: High def, good stuff.

256
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, oh my goodness.

257
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:01,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I must have played that a lot this week.

258
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:02,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I got all the achievements.

259
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:05,419
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all really easy, especially if you play music games.

260
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a whole lot of fun.

261
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:16,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it almost convinced somebody at work to get a 360 too, because he was really enjoying it.

262
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:18,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, so the music game fans will be all over this.

263
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:27,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, it depends on if you care about the quality of music you're playing the game to.

264
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:30,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Canogram says it sounds like every Xtend Extra.

265
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:32,610
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because this game's good.

266
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked every extent extra, whatever.

267
00:15:35,887 --> 00:15:37,928
[SPEAKER_03]: No, every extent extra.

268
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:43,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Music was a part of it, kind of like Rez, but Rez wasn't really a music game.

269
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:44,530
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that music was an important element.

270
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,990
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what every extent extra is like.

271
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,230
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a rhythm game.

272
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:53,092
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a game where you blow something up to cause chain reactions.

273
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:57,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you hit one of those arrows, fireworks explosions happen.

274
00:15:57,614 --> 00:16:00,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's like DDR once you hit 100 combo.

275
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:03,390
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a little flashy explosions.

276
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:08,353
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's timing issues with the game, too, and I don't think they'll be fixed before.

277
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:11,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure what I was playing is the release candidate.

278
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:14,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need it to come out now really bad.

279
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:15,918
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

280
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:17,198
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.

281
00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:24,723
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week, interestingly enough, I don't know if you were listening last week, but I mentioned I was going to be going on vacation for a little while.

282
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have been on vacation the past four days.

283
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:30,887
[SPEAKER_03]: In the middle of nowhere, I was up in the Mendocino, Fort Bragg, coastal area, Northern California.

284
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:35,910
[SPEAKER_03]: No internet, no phones, no games, really nothing.

285
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just nice to have a break away from everything.

286
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:42,553
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll get into kind of what effect that's going to have on tonight's show in just a minute.

287
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:45,534
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so I just took a break.

288
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:50,136
[SPEAKER_03]: But before I left, I did get to sneak in a little bit of Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Xbox Live.

289
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:50,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.

290
00:16:51,117 --> 00:16:53,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my heck, it is awesome.

291
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:54,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so great.

292
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:58,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just the fact that, I mean...

293
00:16:59,022 --> 00:16:59,502
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX LIVE ARCADE

294
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:25,457
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

295
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:55,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't you mention something about no loading times or anything?

296
00:17:55,185 --> 00:17:56,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, there's no loading times.

297
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:58,168
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to wait for anything.

298
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:00,030
[SPEAKER_03]: They kept all the voice acting intact.

299
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:00,990
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

300
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:05,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I definitely recommend, especially if you've never played it before.

301
00:18:05,454 --> 00:18:06,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.

302
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:09,498
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a lot of hours that you can put into the game if you've never played it before.

303
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:12,961
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no excuse to have never played that game before.

304
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't care.

305
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:17,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking in chatroom.

306
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:19,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaze says, Sky was a hippie for four days, basically.

307
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:19,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, basically.

308
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:21,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

309
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,248
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll give you my full thoughts on that next week.

310
00:18:47,268 --> 00:18:51,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it doesn't seem bad, but it doesn't seem as great as Tetris DS either.

311
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:52,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are just my initial five minute thoughts.

312
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,550
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll look at it more in depth later.

313
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,690
[SPEAKER_02]: They have like videos playing in the background.

314
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,131
[SPEAKER_02]: The HD videos look pretty hot.

315
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:05,052
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's kind of interesting though is they also had, you can cheat in it just like you can with the Tetris DS.

316
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:13,374
[SPEAKER_02]: You can rotate blocks or whatever and then you can actually basically kind of hover them there forever until you decide where you want to put them.

317
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:14,914
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty sweet.

318
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:18,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you more thoughts on that next week here on the program.

319
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:44,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously the live element is an important part of our show.

320
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:47,216
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want it to go anywhere, so we suggest you guys all check this out.

321
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:52,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I know our buddy Travis Donovan went into detail on this on his program on Saturday night.

322
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:59,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had a chance to listen to it yet, so if you want to go check him out on iTunes under Travis Donovan, you can check out what he has to say on it.

323
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,766
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what we're going to do about this yet.

324
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:08,290
[SPEAKER_03]: We understand it has changed some rules already on Life 365, which may be kind of a pain in the butt to listen to us on Life 365.

325
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Long story short, we don't play enough...

326
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:13,695
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

327
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:43,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst case scenario, if the rates of Live 365 had to go through the roof, we might have to go a couple weeks with no live element, but we would find a new home, set up something on Shoutcast, I don't know.

328
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:53,807
[SPEAKER_03]: But seeing as Orange Dawn Radio is a bit of a network now, because we have some other great shows like STFU on Thursdays and Travis Donovan on Saturdays, we don't want to lose any of those other shows that we've built up over time.

329
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:58,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So more to come on that when we have some time to kind of sit down and

330
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Take this all in, what's going on with us.

331
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:04,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, I'm just getting back and hitting all this news.

332
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:10,396
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to check out what the rest of our staff has to say about it.

333
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:10,997
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

334
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:22,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Travis Donovan is in chat and says, urges folks to visit Life35.com slash choice and says, you all need to contact your local congressperson and let them know they need to level the playing field again.

335
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the air radio does not pay royalty rates, but internet and satellite radio must.

336
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:28,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't sound very fair to me.

337
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:35,413
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's going to hurt the little guys like us and other great live 365 and just internet radio stations in general.

338
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:37,355
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of sucks.

339
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll have more info on that next week.

340
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:41,398
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

341
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,026
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

342
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,680
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 finally came out for you.

343
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,420
[SPEAKER_02]: That time has finally come.

344
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:15,582
[SPEAKER_02]: You can finally buy your overpriced gaming machine.

345
00:22:17,263 --> 00:22:20,164
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were some interesting stories coming out about that.

346
00:22:20,264 --> 00:22:22,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, one that pretty much sums everything up.

347
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:31,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Phil Harrison basically was saying that Europe is the most important continent for the gaming industry.

348
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:34,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is funny because it was also the last one to get the PlayStation 3.

349
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:38,692
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently the third is also the most important

350
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:49,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was told, you know, this gameindustry.biz, big industry site, it's got the most countries and it's got the most people.

351
00:22:49,466 --> 00:22:51,327
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also got the most cultures.

352
00:22:51,828 --> 00:23:04,135
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that we've got the launch here with more consoles shipped on day one than we've ever had in our history is a compliment to the most important market of the world, the European market.

353
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:09,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, that sounds a lot of sucking up to me if you ask me, especially since...

354
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,110
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

355
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,202
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

356
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:51,282
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have done things a little differently, correct?

357
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:53,343
[SPEAKER_02]: But oh wait, it doesn't stop there.

358
00:23:53,703 --> 00:24:04,867
[SPEAKER_02]: To prove that point, they even went out of their way to give out free TVs to the first 100 people purchasing the PlayStation 3 at their London launch event.

359
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:09,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Free 46-inch HD TVs and a free taxi ride home with those.

360
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:11,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus, that's not a bad deal.

361
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:13,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my damn TV?

362
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know...

363
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, the 100 people that sat out in line, like it's incentive to wait in the cold or whatever?

364
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

365
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:20,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

366
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:25,529
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, in the U.S., you know, you have to wait two days to get... And dodge bullets.

367
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:26,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dodge bullets and stuff.

368
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:30,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe have to race and slam into a pole and get sent to the hospital in a coma.

369
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:31,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

370
00:24:31,153 --> 00:24:35,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the U.K., you get free TVs to go with your gaming systems and stuff.

371
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:39,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Raven's Dolphin in chat says, we get shot, they get TVs.

372
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,161
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?

373
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:41,061
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big PR.

374
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that just because British people are nicer?

375
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:43,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what is that?

376
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:43,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

377
00:24:43,804 --> 00:24:44,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

378
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:49,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that to encourage people to actually go outside and wait in line or what?

379
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:51,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they didn't know that this was going to happen.

380
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:53,927
[SPEAKER_02]: This was just something that they did.

381
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:59,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they said, hey, by the way, we're going to give away free 46-inch TVs, everyone would have been there.

382
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,104
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

383
00:25:18,145 --> 00:25:24,209
[SPEAKER_03]: for the media to photograph so they can go, hey, look how popular the PS3 is in Europe even though they had to wait six months for it.

384
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:24,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, though.

385
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:28,511
[SPEAKER_02]: If they did something like that, they'd be like, yeah, but it's only because you're giving away free TVs.

386
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:32,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not because of the PlayStation 3 and they would have just spun it that way.

387
00:25:33,254 --> 00:25:35,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is just kissing ass.

388
00:25:35,595 --> 00:25:36,896
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole lot of kissing ass.

389
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:42,159
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, please don't be mad at us that we waited so long and you have to pay more for a system that actually does less.

390
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't be mad.

391
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Fire games.

392
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:46,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Joshi16 says, Sony was eating crayons.

393
00:25:47,742 --> 00:25:52,203
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't eating crayons, they were just kissing ass, that's all it was.

394
00:25:52,303 --> 00:26:00,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, GS68 says it doesn't free stuff bundles with something up the price, but you're saying these are absolutely free TVs that they gave away to the first... Absolutely free.

395
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:02,886
[SPEAKER_03]: At, like, one particular London store?

396
00:26:03,347 --> 00:26:11,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, it was where they were doing their launch event, where the Sony president would be handing out the first PS3 type thing, you know, something like that, so...

397
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:16,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony withheld the release of the PlayStation 3 in order to build up stock levels for the launch.

398
00:26:41,457 --> 00:26:47,099
[SPEAKER_02]: A situation where the Xbox 360 was terrible and the Wii doesn't even hit the sides when it comes in.

399
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:52,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, I think this is a very good move on Sony's part.

400
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,161
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't have that negativity of not being able to supply enough units.

401
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:59,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good that they're able to supply enough units.

402
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:02,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's really an issue, though.

403
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:05,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think the demand's just less for it.

404
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

405
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:10,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool that they have enough units out there.

406
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:21,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, though, and it kind of gets into that whole demand thing, outside of the launch event, it wasn't so pretty for Sony.

407
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,481
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, there was a few situations where you only had a few people lining up for the system, and no one cared.

408
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:39,104
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, Virgin Megastore, they had some campers outside, but it was really only about three or so people that were waiting in line for the system.

409
00:27:40,152 --> 00:28:06,820
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of other stores you know there were some situations where they're breaking street in Italy and stuff like that and there's also stuff where people were just not coming in pre-ordering or even buying the system at all so a lot of people said who cares at this point I don't know so it's kind of negative a little bit what do you think made the UK folks not want to line up for it do you think it was because of what happened over here do you think maybe they just don't

410
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Get Excited Like This

411
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:40,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a little bit what Shane said, maybe not so harsh.

412
00:28:41,193 --> 00:28:43,314
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a lot of games out there right now.

413
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:46,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of exclusive stuff that's really, you know, must-have.

414
00:28:46,415 --> 00:28:49,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's really one of those systems that, okay, maybe it's better off to wait.

415
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:52,518
[SPEAKER_02]: When the price comes down a little bit and there's more of a library.

416
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they were kind of getting shafted for a while.

417
00:28:54,878 --> 00:28:57,820
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people that were waiting, you know, the six months or whatever.

418
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:58,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Not six months.

419
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:21,479
[SPEAKER_02]: 4 months, 3 months, you know, to get the system, probably like say, hey, you know what, maybe 360 is a little bit better, maybe I should just pick this up now, because I can get it now, and there's a big library of games out there, or get the Wii, and then just, making them wait for a while, if they're really itching to get, you know, their grasp of the new game systems, they're just going to go someplace else and get something that's out now.

420
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:28,423
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know, they're really having a hard time distinguishing themselves as why you need this system.

421
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:30,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing.

422
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,191
[SPEAKER_02]: And UK wasn't the only problem with... They didn't have the only problems with launches.

423
00:29:36,812 --> 00:29:39,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia, the launch wasn't very great over there.

424
00:29:39,453 --> 00:29:45,095
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, their launch event only drew about... I want to say like 40 people is what I was reading.

425
00:29:45,315 --> 00:29:52,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I had read that a lot of these launch events were getting cancelled because of the fear of gunshots and all the crap that happened here.

426
00:29:52,978 --> 00:29:57,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear too many of that, but I know the ones that they were talking about in Australia...

427
00:29:58,776 --> 00:30:10,023
[SPEAKER_02]: They had about maybe 40 people show up, another 30 that were press, and it was pretty much like kind of, I don't know, just people weren't really excited about it.

428
00:30:10,203 --> 00:30:16,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's just because not a lot of people were pre-ordering them or just no one really wanted them.

429
00:30:16,907 --> 00:30:19,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess, you had one comment earlier but got cut off.

430
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,309
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you want to say about all this?

431
00:30:20,329 --> 00:30:22,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say they're all busy playing Wii Bowling.

432
00:30:24,651 --> 00:30:27,713
[SPEAKER_03]: They're too busy to go stand out in line and wait for a Sony because they're all busy playing Wii Bowling.

433
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:28,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're playing Wii Bowling.

434
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:30,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I got you.

435
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you have camped out for this?

436
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:32,531
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

437
00:30:32,971 --> 00:30:33,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

438
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:35,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say you had the money.

439
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:38,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say you had 600 euros, dollars, whatever right now.

440
00:30:39,313 --> 00:30:40,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you go camp out?

441
00:30:40,613 --> 00:30:45,235
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because I probably already have a Wii, and I don't have a desire to have a PS3.

442
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:46,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be spending my time on the Wii.

443
00:30:46,755 --> 00:30:47,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a question for you.

444
00:30:47,456 --> 00:30:50,717
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been very vocal about your hate for Xbox on this show previously.

445
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you buy an Xbox at this point before a PlayStation 3, Xbox 360?

446
00:30:54,358 --> 00:30:57,499
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had... Okay, in terms of if I had to...

447
00:30:57,964 --> 00:30:58,764
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

448
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I like the 360.

449
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:26,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to recall, though, on this program, you were very excited about the Wii.

450
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:26,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I was.

451
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:28,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So when did this change in heart happen?

452
00:31:28,773 --> 00:31:33,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was when Nintendo decided that they were too good to release games anymore.

453
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:37,237
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to play crappy games, and that's all they've been giving us lately.

454
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:39,819
[SPEAKER_03]: You do this all the time, though, to be fair.

455
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:44,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I distinctly remember you sold your Xbox 360 back for the same reason.

456
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,202
[SPEAKER_01]: How many PS2s have I had?

457
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:50,884
[SPEAKER_03]: When Final Fantasy XI came out, you bought a new one eventually because you were like,

458
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:53,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I have to be a Corsair because they're pretty.

459
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:55,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, have you sold your Wii back at this point?

460
00:31:55,969 --> 00:32:00,731
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but my Wii has been broken since I got it, and I have my little return sticker for Nintendo.

461
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:02,212
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to call and get a new one, actually.

462
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:07,835
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have no desire to send it back because, like, what am I going to play on it right now?

463
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:08,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never finished Zelda.

464
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:10,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, you can sell it.

465
00:32:10,517 --> 00:32:14,140
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going for a lot of money right now because they can't find them and people want them.

466
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:16,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't want yours, might as well sell it.

467
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:19,345
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the year, you're going to get your Mario Galaxy, your Metroid.

468
00:32:19,365 --> 00:32:20,346
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want one anyway.

469
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:22,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no desire for Mario Galaxy, thanks to Sunshine.

470
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:23,468
[SPEAKER_01]: But Metroid, yeah.

471
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:24,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Smash Bros., yeah.

472
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they'll have another color by then.

473
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a color whore anyway.

474
00:32:28,273 --> 00:32:29,213
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

475
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:30,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I want something you'll talk about later.

476
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:33,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

477
00:32:33,157 --> 00:32:33,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

478
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:42,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Joshi16 says the exact same thing happened on the DS, don't act surprised Blaze says die Miklatov die

479
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:00,252
[SPEAKER_01]: You can die too.

480
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:07,297
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, Miklatov's Wii's been broken, which Sakuramax follows right up with, Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

481
00:33:07,837 --> 00:33:10,879
[SPEAKER_01]: That's creepy, and so quit talking, please.

482
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,723
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, if you listened to last week's program, I was all excited about playing Cooking Mama this week.

483
00:33:16,984 --> 00:33:22,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Toys R Us today to try to get it when I bought Tetris, because I had something to take back, so I had a credit there anyway.

484
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And they told me it didn't come out until next week.

485
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:26,611
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out last week.

486
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:27,651
[SPEAKER_02]: They're retarded.

487
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:28,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So Toys R Us lied to me.

488
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:32,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they have old information or their shipments didn't come in.

489
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:33,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitch!

490
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not something that was delayed.

491
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:39,011
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been out there.

492
00:33:39,031 --> 00:33:40,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard the game's been in crap reviews anyway.

493
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:41,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little worried.

494
00:33:42,492 --> 00:33:45,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a blockbuster yesterday, so I know it's out there.

495
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:47,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

496
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:51,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Mama needs to fix her shipping dates.

497
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:51,914
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what she needs to fix.

498
00:33:51,954 --> 00:33:53,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm not even going to rent this.

499
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:55,015
[SPEAKER_02]: No thank you.

500
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:55,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to buy it.

501
00:33:55,855 --> 00:33:57,596
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I'm going to buy it because I'm dumb.

502
00:33:59,264 --> 00:34:00,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookin' Mama on the Wii.

503
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:01,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that looks so great, I want it.

504
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:03,506
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been getting negative reviews everywhere.

505
00:34:03,786 --> 00:34:05,687
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks great, but it controls like crap.

506
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:07,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you be excited for it?

507
00:34:07,368 --> 00:34:08,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're a woman and you do that already.

508
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:11,850
[SPEAKER_05]: But not on a DS.

509
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:12,650
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Wii.

510
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,911
[SPEAKER_02]: On a Wii, stupid!

511
00:34:14,371 --> 00:34:15,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Or on a Wii, shut up.

512
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:22,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really disappointing that it controls like crap, because I mean, I was hoping that it would be, it looked fun, and the DS one looked fun too, it's just,

513
00:34:23,584 --> 00:34:27,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there were some control issues, and really, that frustrates the hell out of you.

514
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:28,286
[SPEAKER_03]: More comments from chat.

515
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:31,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really relying on chat tonight, because I have not been reading the internet this week.

516
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:34,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Zappy says, the original Cookie Mama got bad reviews, too.

517
00:34:34,928 --> 00:34:36,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it had control issues.

518
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:37,769
[SPEAKER_03]: It has control issues.

519
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:38,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

520
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:44,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Skylark makes a good point and says, luckily, Super Paper Mario comes out in a few weeks.

521
00:34:45,772 --> 00:34:45,952
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

522
00:34:45,992 --> 00:34:48,173
[SPEAKER_03]: You're booing Super Paper Mario, Mikotov?

523
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:49,572
[SPEAKER_03]: The crap!

524
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,013
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong with Super Paper Mario?

525
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:51,793
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks great!

526
00:34:52,294 --> 00:34:58,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't like it because it is a Paper Mario title, and I don't like Paper Mario games.

527
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:03,903
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a frickin' platformer game, but I'm sick of platformers, and I hate everything.

528
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there.

529
00:35:06,225 --> 00:35:08,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, you heard about the Power Rangers game that's coming out?

530
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:09,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding!

531
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:10,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotcha.

532
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:11,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucker!

533
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaze wanted to point out Miklatov just won my love back.

534
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:17,672
[SPEAKER_03]: LOL.

535
00:35:18,012 --> 00:35:19,713
[SPEAKER_02]: No one makes Power Ranger games anymore.

536
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:20,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what he didn't say.

537
00:35:21,054 --> 00:35:22,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And GS68 says Cooking Milf.

538
00:35:23,816 --> 00:35:24,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that'll be the sequel.

539
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:25,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooking Milf.

540
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,178
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wrong.

541
00:35:28,819 --> 00:35:34,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else that's wrong is removing the emotion engine out of the PlayStation 3 to cut down costs.

542
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:36,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, okay, I will give them this.

543
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:38,766
[SPEAKER_02]: It does now, they have with the new...

544
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:40,920
[SPEAKER_02]: V1.6 firmware.

545
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:46,726
[SPEAKER_02]: The original PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games are emulated now with software emulation instead of hardware.

546
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:51,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the 2,451 PlayStation 2 titles in the European region, only 1,782 titles work.

547
00:36:02,873 --> 00:36:05,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, to be honest though, that's a lot better than the 360.

548
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:08,457
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a lot better than the 360.

549
00:36:08,517 --> 00:36:11,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know, what does that really mean?

550
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:16,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because that's a lot of titles, but maybe it's a lot of, you know, Barbie Horse Adventures type stuff.

551
00:36:16,663 --> 00:36:19,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, how much of this stuff am I going to want to play?

552
00:36:19,765 --> 00:36:23,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And which games, you know, are working, not working, etc.

553
00:36:24,169 --> 00:36:30,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying to remember here, I want to say of the list that they are saying that

554
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:31,615
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't working.

555
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:38,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see Final Fantasy 7, Resident Evil 2, Ratchet and Clank, Metal Gear Solid 2.

556
00:36:38,203 --> 00:36:40,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some of the PS1 games that weren't working.

557
00:36:41,788 --> 00:36:45,733
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, let's see, uh, big name issue, or there was, um,

558
00:36:47,346 --> 00:36:51,107
[SPEAKER_02]: 550 of the games that had noticeable issues, according to Sony.

559
00:36:51,628 --> 00:37:00,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Among the big-name titles like Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider 2 on the PlayStation 1, Final Fantasy X, Kingdom Hearts, SingStar, Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas on the PlayStation 2.

560
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:04,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all ones that didn't work?

561
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:06,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all ones that had noticeable issues.

562
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:08,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, lame.

563
00:37:08,733 --> 00:37:10,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, to be fair, to be fair, though,

564
00:37:11,408 --> 00:37:20,292
[SPEAKER_02]: A thousand... You know, 1,700 titles for your system that are backwards compatible, a lot better than over 300, you know, for the 360, so... Yeah, I guess that's true.

565
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:23,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're working on it, so give them some credit.

566
00:37:23,614 --> 00:37:32,759
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot more than I was expecting to work with the system, so... They're doing something right, at least, but I still think it's kind of crappy that it's, you know, software emulation now.

567
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:33,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares, though?

568
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one of the original PlayStation 3s, and it plays it on hardware emulation, so...

569
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

570
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon me for a minute.

571
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a sidebar issue completely unrelated to take care of.

572
00:37:42,141 --> 00:37:47,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it when I got up to sneak to go use the bathroom, the magic of radio, I can get up and leave and you don't even know?

573
00:37:48,722 --> 00:37:54,303
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet I noticed in chat I suddenly said, I'm Rob, I'm so flamey, blah, blah, blah.

574
00:37:56,043 --> 00:37:56,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, Rob, you're amazing.

575
00:37:57,003 --> 00:37:58,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to let you take a guess who said that.

576
00:37:59,064 --> 00:38:01,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was probably Miklatov.

577
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:03,504
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably right.

578
00:38:03,524 --> 00:38:05,145
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pointing back and forth at each other.

579
00:38:05,165 --> 00:38:06,805
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are jerks.

580
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:07,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, man.

581
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:08,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Banned from the show forever.

582
00:38:09,509 --> 00:38:09,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw.

583
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Wah, wah, wah.

584
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,670
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny, though.

585
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:20,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So, with the PlayStation 1.6 firmware for the PlayStation 3, you got some other stuff.

586
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:23,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just, you know, some backwards compatibility vehicle.

587
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:23,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, hold on.

588
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:25,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to comment on the whole backwards compatibility thing.

589
00:38:25,673 --> 00:38:26,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

590
00:38:26,813 --> 00:38:27,214
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.

591
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:28,214
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

592
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:29,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

593
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:30,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

594
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,560
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is there to say?

595
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

596
00:38:33,641 --> 00:38:34,182
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.

597
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:46,051
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I do feel like, okay, if you're going to buy a PlayStation 3... You know, I called into All Games Radio very randomly on Tuesday or Wednesday, one of the days before I leave, to talk about this, and I kind of made a little joke.

598
00:38:46,432 --> 00:38:48,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I don't know, they were doing something on there.

599
00:38:48,353 --> 00:38:52,757
[SPEAKER_03]: They were joking that the whole cast of OLR was at the Sony factory doing backwards compatibility.

600
00:38:53,217 --> 00:38:53,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ask.

601
00:38:53,738 --> 00:38:55,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what it was.

602
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So I called in pretending to be at the Sony factory.

603
00:38:57,681 --> 00:38:58,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I made this little joke about...

604
00:38:59,645 --> 00:39:06,231
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to buy a PlayStation 3 to play all your old PlayStation 2 games, maybe you ought to save $400 and buy a PlayStation 2.

605
00:39:07,192 --> 00:39:07,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

606
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair?

607
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:08,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

608
00:39:08,894 --> 00:39:09,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know why.

609
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:34,723
[SPEAKER_03]: at one point I do want to go well that kind of sucks you can't play all your old games but seeing as the system doesn't really upscale it yet like it was supposed to right they don't actually the software emulation will allow it to upscale so that is good but it's not that big a deal it's not that big a deal it's not going to suddenly make your games HD beautiful blah blah blah it's just going to be like a little bit smoother honestly ask yourself I mean really if you've got a Playstation 3

610
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:38,828
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're really gearing to play some next-gen games.

611
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:41,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you really playing PlayStation 1 games?

612
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not.

613
00:39:42,192 --> 00:39:43,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I have PlayStation 2 games.

614
00:39:43,654 --> 00:39:45,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a PlayStation 2 as well.

615
00:39:45,657 --> 00:39:46,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't touch the thing.

616
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:48,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play any of those games.

617
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm playing new stuff.

618
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:52,787
[SPEAKER_02]: If I really want to go back and play Kingdom Hearts 2 or whatever...

619
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:54,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play it on my PlayStation 2.

620
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... I mean, PlayStation 2s are still selling really well.

621
00:39:57,934 --> 00:39:58,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

622
00:39:58,716 --> 00:40:02,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're sort of readily available out there.

623
00:40:02,201 --> 00:40:07,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and they're not that expensive and they'll probably drop in price again once we get down to Christmas time again.

624
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:08,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

625
00:40:09,099 --> 00:40:16,261
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, though, I do get a little irritated when Xbox 360 talks about how they're going to abandon pretty much the old Xbox stuff come 2008.

626
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:17,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we had a story on that last week.

627
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:20,802
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know people go, well, just play it on your old Xbox, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

628
00:40:21,162 --> 00:40:22,502
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

629
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:23,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I don't feel like cooking.

630
00:40:23,703 --> 00:40:26,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I only have so much room in my living room for so many game systems.

631
00:40:26,903 --> 00:40:29,944
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is kind of convenient sometimes to be able to do the backwards compatibility thing.

632
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:33,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a nice thing that they've added since, I think, was it?

633
00:40:33,906 --> 00:40:36,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the PlayStation 2 was the first system to actually do that.

634
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a great selling point.

635
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:40,471
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all your PlayStation 1 games actually makes them run a little bit better.

636
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:44,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can do better graphics or, you know, better load times.

637
00:40:44,414 --> 00:40:45,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of cool.

638
00:40:45,555 --> 00:40:50,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I might add, PlayStation 1 load times, or PlayStation 3 load times kind of suck on certain games.

639
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Ghetto.

640
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they should allow to all install the hard drive.

641
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:54,463
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be really nice.

642
00:40:54,803 --> 00:40:55,824
[SPEAKER_02]: But either way, um,

643
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still, it's not, I would say though, 1700 games working for your system is a lot better than 300.

644
00:41:03,283 --> 00:41:05,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's something that they've got.

645
00:41:05,064 --> 00:41:08,325
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Xbox did not have as big of a library as the PlayStation 2.

646
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:08,626
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

647
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:12,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they didn't have anything before Xbox.

648
00:41:12,547 --> 00:41:12,768
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

649
00:41:12,808 --> 00:41:14,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft didn't compete with PlayStation 1.

650
00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:23,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, I'm hoping that they do stick on, you know, they really concentrate on the backwards compatibility instead of just saying, ah, fuck it, you know, we got this made to work, so.

651
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:25,537
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

652
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:26,418
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done.

653
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:27,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Good enough.

654
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:34,370
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, It's funny that Microsoft killed the Xbox One right away, and PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 are still around.

655
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:40,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know so much about PlayStation 1, but certainly PlayStation 2's still got quite a bit of life, it seems, left in it.

656
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:45,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if God of War 2 is like its last gasp of air or if that's going to be the last big game.

657
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:49,912
[SPEAKER_02]: That may be the last Sony game, but they're still making games throughout the year.

658
00:41:49,952 --> 00:41:51,092
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming out for the PlayStation 2.

659
00:41:51,152 --> 00:41:54,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure we'll get Sudoku Master for years to come on PlayStation 2.

660
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:56,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a lot of Sudoku.

661
00:41:57,114 --> 00:42:00,095
[SPEAKER_03]: When you don't have a PSP or a DS, it's all about Sudoku.

662
00:42:00,315 --> 00:42:01,435
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheap to develop for.

663
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:01,935
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.

664
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:03,756
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one system that has...

665
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:04,372
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

666
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:29,583
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

667
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:56,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me quickly go to another sidebar comment, then we get back into the news here.

668
00:42:57,565 --> 00:42:59,826
[SPEAKER_03]: The comments in the chatroom, this is an interesting conversation.

669
00:42:59,887 --> 00:43:04,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Jvmon says, if you have a PlayStation 3, why the hell are you still playing Final Fantasy VII?

670
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:09,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And then ShadowNextGen says, Jvmon, Final Fantasy VII is a classic that I will always play.

671
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:31,782
[SPEAKER_03]: and then moving on let's see JV Mon says then play it on your PlayStation 2 and Hippolytus says this he says I for example never owned a PlayStation I think he means PS1 but now that I have a PlayStation 2 I can play PlayStation 1 games but that begs the comment how many people do you know that's actually you're going to go get a PlayStation 3 who never had a PlayStation 2

672
00:43:32,549 --> 00:43:34,030
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do know of one person.

673
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:39,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a friend who's considering getting a PlayStation 3 and he never had a PlayStation 2 or a PlayStation 1.

674
00:43:39,372 --> 00:43:42,513
[SPEAKER_03]: He's thinking about getting it because he can play all the backwards compatible stuff.

675
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,654
[SPEAKER_03]: In this country, you still can.

676
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:47,095
[SPEAKER_02]: If this is a big concern for them, I would recommend that they do.

677
00:43:47,575 --> 00:43:55,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is going to be a different SKU or slightly different item, not item number, like, you know, their Sony item numbers or whatever.

678
00:43:55,859 --> 00:44:00,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, you're going to be able to look on the box and tell which version of the PlayStation 3 this is.

679
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:00,801
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that has...

680
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:01,989
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com

681
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:33,756
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is that it's going to come at a cost.

682
00:44:33,776 --> 00:44:38,180
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have that chip on there, and they've already said they're going to take it out for the U.S.

683
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:38,460
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.

684
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's a real big deal for you, maybe spend the extra money.

685
00:44:42,744 --> 00:44:45,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's either that or you're going to spend another $99 on a PlayStation 2.

686
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So pick your poison.

687
00:44:48,629 --> 00:44:52,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this way you get a larger hard drive with it at the same time.

688
00:44:52,913 --> 00:44:55,135
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy a more expensive system or something.

689
00:44:55,155 --> 00:44:56,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

690
00:44:58,231 --> 00:45:03,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so back to the PlayStation 3 1.6 firmware that's out there.

691
00:45:04,414 --> 00:45:12,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, they've added background downloading, something that they should have had from the beginning because this thing downloads, like, fucking slow.

692
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:15,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, to be fair, 360 didn't have it at first either.

693
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

694
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:17,601
[SPEAKER_03]: It badly needed it, too.

695
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:22,964
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would have hoped that since, you know, the PlayStation 3 came out a year later that they would kind of learn from it.

696
00:45:22,984 --> 00:45:23,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you that.

697
00:45:23,644 --> 00:45:24,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Learn from their mistakes, so...

698
00:45:25,757 --> 00:45:39,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, so now it does work and it is confirmed that it will work while you're watching a Blu-ray movie or playing an offline game, non-online game, just like basically the same rules as a 360, so that's kind of cool.

699
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:44,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing, well, and also kind of another thing, why would you really need background downloading?

700
00:45:44,553 --> 00:45:47,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's not a lot to download on the store right now.

701
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:48,216
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyways.

702
00:45:49,257 --> 00:45:54,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that does add, and this is kind of neat, is that folding at home

703
00:45:55,041 --> 00:46:03,785
[SPEAKER_02]: That basically the kind of program that runs in the background to help crunch numbers to figure out how to come up with cures for diseases and whatnot.

704
00:46:04,346 --> 00:46:18,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting enough, this was released this week, the firmware update, and already the PlayStation 3 is processing a lot more numbers than anything else.

705
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:21,754
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, even more than most of the Windows PCs out there.

706
00:46:23,035 --> 00:46:41,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now they are currently doing 251 teraflops, which is $100 trillion more than... They were saying that the PlayStation 3 machines are delivering over 251 trillion floating point operations per second.

707
00:46:42,606 --> 00:46:46,828
[SPEAKER_02]: $100 trillion more than 10 times the number of active PC CPUs.

708
00:46:47,811 --> 00:47:00,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this folding at home thing, and forgive my ignorance a little bit because I don't have a PlayStation 3, so I'm not really following this very much, but is this something that you automatically kind of stealth installs in your PlayStation 3 and just runs without you knowing it?

709
00:47:00,759 --> 00:47:06,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you have to download this, or it's basically a, I'm not sure if it's included with the update.

710
00:47:06,563 --> 00:47:08,644
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is included with the update, it's a program you have to run.

711
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:11,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It runs almost like a screensaver, and it will crunch numbers automatically.

712
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:17,991
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, for a PC, you would have to elect to download this and kind of seek it out, right?

713
00:47:18,332 --> 00:47:22,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but the thing is, though, you have to run it in order for it to actually run.

714
00:47:22,696 --> 00:47:24,417
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that will run automatically.

715
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:28,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like distributed net, because I used to run that back in college.

716
00:47:29,061 --> 00:47:30,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that.

717
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:32,705
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically like the old SETI at home, stuff like that.

718
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,306
[SPEAKER_03]: A little cow icon.

719
00:47:34,806 --> 00:47:39,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Except now, instead of searching for extraterrestrial life, because I guess they gave up on that.

720
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:45,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of that, they're looking to, you know, cure cancer.

721
00:47:45,694 --> 00:47:52,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can't wait for the press release when one of these PlayStation 3s happens to crunch the magical number to cure cancer.

722
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony cures cancer.

723
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:57,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can see that PR right now.

724
00:47:58,103 --> 00:48:02,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Joshi16 in chat says, Cure cancer, 1,000 gamer points, and a home trophy.

725
00:48:02,807 --> 00:48:03,167
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

726
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:05,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I want the cure cancer trophy.

727
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:06,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

728
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:10,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Onto a completely different system and subject.

729
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:15,704
[SPEAKER_02]: This rumor of the black Xbox 360 just will never die.

730
00:48:16,405 --> 00:48:18,526
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's now confirmed to be real.

731
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:20,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably why the rumor never died.

732
00:48:21,128 --> 00:48:31,815
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the latest issue of Game Informer Magazine... Which further goes to show Microsoft rumors 90% of the time, unless you made it up yourself, Microsoft rumors are always true.

733
00:48:33,436 --> 00:48:33,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Always true.

734
00:48:36,091 --> 00:48:42,354
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been announced, at least according to the article in Game Informer, not officially announced yet, but anyways.

735
00:48:43,155 --> 00:48:49,838
[SPEAKER_02]: An HDMI-enabled black unit is coming out for $479.

736
00:48:49,978 --> 00:48:52,419
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a limited edition in black.

737
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:53,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be in white later.

738
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,181
[SPEAKER_02]: But limited edition for $479.

739
00:48:56,581 --> 00:48:57,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's supposed to have a larger hard drive, 120 GB.

740
00:49:04,134 --> 00:49:13,356
[SPEAKER_02]: and other rumored options with this is that it's supposed to also have black accessories coming out for it, so eventually you'll see different colored controllers and whatnot.

741
00:49:14,056 --> 00:49:20,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing also they're talking about is the IPTV is supposed to be enabled in it as well.

742
00:49:21,338 --> 00:49:22,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something interesting.

743
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:30,400
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've already spent the money, though, on your 360, you'll be happy to know there will be a larger hard drive coming out for under $200.

744
00:49:31,904 --> 00:49:43,293
[SPEAKER_02]: and the other rumor with that is that there is going to be a data cable included with the new 360 and the new hard drive that will allow you to be able to hook up your old hard drive to transfer any saves you have.

745
00:49:43,473 --> 00:49:45,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that's true.

746
00:49:47,596 --> 00:49:50,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Microsoft rumors usually end up being true, so it would make sense.

747
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:52,600
[SPEAKER_03]: But interesting.

748
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:54,021
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

749
00:49:54,081 --> 00:49:59,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get too excited about the black Xbox 360 because I think, well, the first Xbox was black and nobody cared.

750
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's going to be called the Elite.

751
00:50:02,881 --> 00:50:04,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what they're calling it right now.

752
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:08,063
[SPEAKER_02]: The Core system's not going away.

753
00:50:08,483 --> 00:50:10,163
[SPEAKER_02]: The Premium system's not going away.

754
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:16,805
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically, this is just going to be another SKU that's added on, and eventually it will become a white system.

755
00:50:16,885 --> 00:50:23,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if it's going to replace the Premium system or not, but they're going to eventually all be white.

756
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:26,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

757
00:50:26,229 --> 00:50:26,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.

758
00:50:27,969 --> 00:50:30,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll see a price drop for the Core, because that'd be kind of nice.

759
00:50:31,556 --> 00:50:32,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard they're ditching the core.

760
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:33,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

761
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:39,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think they would because they want to urge people to download movies and stuff, so that means you have to have a hard drive, right?

762
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but at the same time, they want to still be able to compete against the Wii and stuff.

763
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:46,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they've got to have that lower price point out there.

764
00:50:46,603 --> 00:50:48,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop the premium to $2.99, there you go.

765
00:50:50,165 --> 00:50:51,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be good.

766
00:50:52,186 --> 00:50:53,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if they do price drop to drop it to $2.99...

767
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:59,019
[SPEAKER_02]: They could keep the core around for $199 or something like that.

768
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:03,323
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not going to keep it around, then so be it.

769
00:51:03,423 --> 00:51:05,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll have a unit that's not out there.

770
00:51:06,326 --> 00:51:09,610
[SPEAKER_03]: ShadowNextGen says, New Xbox 360 hard drive for under $200 equals $199.99.

771
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:22,970
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were to guess, actually, I can't remember, because originally the core system, it was $299, and the hard drive is $99, so that would equal $399, roughly.

772
00:51:23,051 --> 00:51:23,731
[SPEAKER_02]: This is $479, so...

773
00:51:31,579 --> 00:51:31,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

774
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:34,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Core system plus new hard drive.

775
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing the hard drive is $179.99.

776
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:39,341
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be my guess.

777
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:43,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaze says, Sky, new colors always make people go, ooh.

778
00:51:43,982 --> 00:51:44,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

779
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:54,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like the white because, you know, for my setup, it's kind of nice because my, you know, Ikea TV table is a light color and then you have the white Wii on one side and the white Xbox 360 on the other side.

780
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:55,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything looks nice.

781
00:51:55,285 --> 00:51:59,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, you got to understand, though, people are stupid and they will buy different colored stuff because...

782
00:52:00,046 --> 00:52:03,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I can understand for the HDMI cable, the big hard drive and that stuff.

783
00:52:03,347 --> 00:52:04,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, I don't know.

784
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:06,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to get it.

785
00:52:07,328 --> 00:52:08,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not going to get it.

786
00:52:08,268 --> 00:52:11,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I might get the new hard drive or something if I really need it or something.

787
00:52:12,189 --> 00:52:13,910
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't need the HDMI.

788
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:16,250
[SPEAKER_02]: My TV doesn't have HDMI, so that's a big deal.

789
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:22,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Black, I couldn't give a crap if the thing was bright green or pink or something.

790
00:52:23,152 --> 00:52:23,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

791
00:52:24,905 --> 00:52:28,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Raven's Dolphin wants to know if you've seen this through your insider sources.

792
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:28,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

793
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:33,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Because certain companies will not talk about stuff before it needs to be out there.

794
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:38,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain companies are a little better about keeping tabs on that stuff than others.

795
00:52:38,793 --> 00:52:46,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony, they're an expert in the PR department and they will not leak crap like this out there.

796
00:52:46,879 --> 00:52:50,001
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I'm surprised that it would even be out there in some of those systems stuff.

797
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:51,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they're doing like test stuff, I don't know.

798
00:52:51,942 --> 00:52:53,583
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, this stuff...

799
00:52:54,093 --> 00:52:54,874
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

800
00:53:24,443 --> 00:53:26,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

801
00:53:26,905 --> 00:53:29,546
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be good to boost stock prices or something.

802
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:35,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, on to the final new system out there, the Wii.

803
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:40,973
[SPEAKER_02]: They are getting the final version of the internet channel towards the end of April.

804
00:53:41,994 --> 00:53:43,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's supposed to be...

805
00:53:45,613 --> 00:53:47,354
[SPEAKER_02]: having some more features added to it.

806
00:53:47,494 --> 00:53:51,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they're improving the... Like getting rid of that goddamn bar that sits at the bottom of your page?

807
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:53,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.

808
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:54,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.

809
00:53:54,157 --> 00:54:00,920
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to find the exact details for it, but I remember improved zooming, auto-resizing of text.

810
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:08,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're improving the little virtual keyboard that's on there so that it has some more preset stuff like www.

811
00:54:09,223 --> 00:54:10,504
[SPEAKER_02]: and HTML and stuff like that.

812
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:12,585
[SPEAKER_02]: So that stuff on there.

813
00:54:13,464 --> 00:54:16,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully they're removing the little bar on there.

814
00:54:16,346 --> 00:54:23,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're extending the free web browser until June now.

815
00:54:23,691 --> 00:54:27,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a nice thing to do considering a lot of people that want to get Wii still can't get them.

816
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:28,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

817
00:54:28,675 --> 00:54:28,955
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

818
00:54:29,855 --> 00:54:31,777
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, I mean, the web browser is five bucks.

819
00:54:31,797 --> 00:54:35,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when it does eventually, you know, when they start charging for it.

820
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

821
00:54:37,701 --> 00:54:39,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see how that would be.

822
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:47,365
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the Wii web browser has been getting a little bit of play in this house because we use it for YouTube.

823
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:51,766
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when there's like seven people over, we want to show something funny on YouTube.

824
00:54:51,806 --> 00:54:55,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, hey, look at this Kelly video on YouTube because you're the only person on the planet that still hasn't seen it.

825
00:54:56,147 --> 00:55:03,049
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go to YouTube and bring it up on the TV and it's kind of cool except for that bar that sits at the bottom of the page and kind of eats up all the space.

826
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:04,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Pornotube.

827
00:55:05,362 --> 00:55:06,382
[SPEAKER_03]: or PornoTube.

828
00:55:06,422 --> 00:55:07,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the New Year's party.

829
00:55:07,623 --> 00:55:10,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

830
00:55:11,364 --> 00:55:13,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's the gateway to porn.

831
00:55:15,246 --> 00:55:19,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, back on the subject of the Wii here.

832
00:55:19,588 --> 00:55:23,189
[SPEAKER_02]: EA announced a brand new game for the Wii called Boogie.

833
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:25,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we had covered a story.

834
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,212
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about how there was going to be a 70s style music game coming out for the Wii.

835
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:31,981
[SPEAKER_02]: and I believe this is it.

836
00:55:32,622 --> 00:55:34,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the Harmonix partnership?

837
00:55:35,247 --> 00:55:35,488
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

838
00:55:35,948 --> 00:55:36,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

839
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:38,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's that going on too, right?

840
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:43,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to remember last week there was some sort of, from Game Developers Conference, EA said...

841
00:55:43,663 --> 00:55:46,865
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna get in bed with Harmonix for one game type thing going on.

842
00:55:47,206 --> 00:55:48,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this related?

843
00:55:48,247 --> 00:55:50,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this has anything to do with Harmonix.

844
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:51,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

845
00:55:51,689 --> 00:55:52,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Just curious.

846
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:58,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a Wii exclusive game and you're gonna be using the nunchuck as well as the remotes to disco dance.

847
00:55:58,935 --> 00:56:06,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And your character kind of looks almost like, I don't know, definitely not human, but there's these evil looking Pikmin things in the background.

848
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:08,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody disco dancing!

849
00:56:08,642 --> 00:56:10,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting what they're doing with that.

850
00:56:11,504 --> 00:56:12,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be kind of fun.

851
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:12,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

852
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:13,486
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

853
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to it.

854
00:56:17,312 --> 00:56:21,555
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be out later this year, of course, no specific anything on that.

855
00:56:21,575 --> 00:56:22,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's still a little vague for me.

856
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:26,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know more about, like, you know, are there videos out there of people playing it?

857
00:56:26,779 --> 00:56:27,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Pictures.

858
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:27,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Pictures?

859
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Pictures of the game.

860
00:56:29,221 --> 00:56:29,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks pretty good.

861
00:56:30,522 --> 00:56:42,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that was announced, or at least reconfirmed, Guitar Hero for the Wii is supposed to be coming out, and they're saying that they're going to actually be doing controllers as well that look like guitars.

862
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a big surprise.

863
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:44,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um,

864
00:56:45,816 --> 00:56:51,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of going back to when they were talking about... Wait, they're going to make controllers that look like guitars?

865
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:52,901
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they were saying.

866
00:56:52,941 --> 00:56:56,803
[SPEAKER_03]: But wouldn't that be a given because Guitar Hero uses a guitar controller?

867
00:56:56,823 --> 00:57:01,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are they saying that feasibly you're going to be able to play this game with no special controller?

868
00:57:01,446 --> 00:57:03,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're actually making new controllers for it.

869
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:04,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

870
00:57:04,228 --> 00:57:04,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

871
00:57:07,474 --> 00:57:11,677
[SPEAKER_02]: It says the cult rhythm game Guitar Hero is on its way to the Wii.

872
00:57:11,697 --> 00:57:16,841
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes with a guitar-shaped controller and plays convincingly enough to make you think you're making real music.

873
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:21,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll get the actual guitar and not pretend we're... Ah, so it's speculation.

874
00:57:21,745 --> 00:57:22,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

875
00:57:24,226 --> 00:57:26,908
[SPEAKER_02]: So no idea if they're going to actually have a real guitar thing.

876
00:57:27,268 --> 00:57:28,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I would hope that they're going to.

877
00:57:28,489 --> 00:57:33,733
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to cut costs, just make a plug-in for the Wii Remote.

878
00:57:34,053 --> 00:57:34,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Stick it in there and...

879
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:41,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the Wii version is going to have to really have something special to make me want to buy another guitar controller.

880
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:11,752
[SPEAKER_03]: and another, you know, I kind of wish they would put out a guitar that would just work on all the systems, kind of like you can get DDR pads to do that.

881
00:58:11,952 --> 00:58:12,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

882
00:58:12,733 --> 00:58:13,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be nice.

883
00:58:15,055 --> 00:58:16,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Then let's see here.

884
00:58:16,036 --> 00:58:21,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one more story, and I think you talked about this a little bit last week, Rob, and it's been finally confirmed.

885
00:58:21,843 --> 00:58:27,329
[SPEAKER_02]: A Nintendo rep has confirmed individual friends lists for the Wii titles.

886
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:52,675
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, they have worked they have done nothing to change the fucking hassle that was DS friends list system and basically they've said I can confirm that the friend code system in the Wi-Fi connection service for the Wii will be the same as it was for the Nintendo DS meaning game specific friend codes and separate friends rosters are used in each game where players can play with identified friends.

887
00:58:53,095 --> 00:58:57,716
[SPEAKER_02]: As with the Nintendo DS, the system was created to ensure gaming environment is kept

888
00:58:58,331 --> 00:58:59,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun for everyone.

889
00:59:00,352 --> 00:59:04,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for the people that have to enter in the 5,000 codes for each damn game.

890
00:59:06,433 --> 00:59:07,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Retarded.

891
00:59:07,394 --> 00:59:09,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... I don't know.

892
00:59:09,934 --> 00:59:11,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about this so I was blue in the face last night.

893
00:59:11,535 --> 00:59:12,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't get it.

894
00:59:13,515 --> 00:59:14,976
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you... You weren't here last week.

895
00:59:14,996 --> 00:59:17,156
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think of this whole friend codes thing on the Wii?

896
00:59:17,536 --> 00:59:21,198
[SPEAKER_03]: That you're going to have to basically enter in your friend code every time to get new players.

897
00:59:21,918 --> 00:59:22,098
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

898
00:59:22,178 --> 00:59:22,698
[SPEAKER_04]: That's dumb.

899
00:59:23,598 --> 00:59:24,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you do on the DS, right?

900
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:25,540
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how you do that on the DS?

901
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,100
[SPEAKER_03]: You enter a friend code.

902
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're going to have to do the same thing on the Wii.

903
00:59:27,662 --> 00:59:32,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though we already put in friend codes to send the messages back and forth on it, you're going to have to do it for every single game.

904
00:59:32,366 --> 00:59:37,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Because heaven forbid you get a, I don't know, a predator on Wii or something.

905
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:44,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that this is something that's not required for third parties or something.

906
00:59:44,356 --> 00:59:44,977
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be fun.

907
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:48,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine with the first party stuff if they want to do that.

908
00:59:49,244 --> 00:59:55,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, but so far with Konami, they have Elebits and WeConnect24 stuff.

909
00:59:56,206 --> 00:59:58,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

910
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's not really playing with anyone online, though.

911
01:00:00,927 --> 01:00:03,568
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just exchanging levels or something.

912
01:00:03,588 --> 01:00:07,629
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think it's retarded, though.

913
01:00:08,509 --> 01:00:11,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you want to be a friend in one game and not another?

914
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:12,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

915
01:00:12,371 --> 01:00:13,451
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense.

916
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:15,687
[SPEAKER_02]: No sense whatsoever.

917
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:18,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why they have to complicate things.

918
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:24,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they got an over, you know, what was the response to the DS one?

919
01:00:24,934 --> 01:00:27,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no one I think actually was positive on it.

920
01:00:27,977 --> 01:00:29,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was like, this fucking sucks.

921
01:00:29,998 --> 01:00:34,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would make you decide, hmm, people really hated it before, let's do it again.

922
01:00:35,022 --> 01:00:35,983
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be awesome.

923
01:00:36,583 --> 01:00:38,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, what was the thought behind this?

924
01:00:39,345 --> 01:00:39,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

925
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there wasn't any thought.

926
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:45,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people aren't really being kidnapped with the goddamn DS.

927
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously.

928
01:00:47,499 --> 01:00:49,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Skylark says, friend codes are horrible.

929
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:51,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Hasn't Nintendo learned anything?

930
01:00:51,442 --> 01:00:54,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather take the risk of meeting child molesters than not be able to play online at all.

931
01:00:56,765 --> 01:00:59,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, how hard is it anyways to add someone?

932
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you just put in a friend code.

933
01:01:01,468 --> 01:01:04,530
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically like accepting, like hitting yes or something.

934
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:07,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people, they won't.

935
01:01:07,882 --> 01:01:11,583
[SPEAKER_02]: People can add you to their friends list, but you have to add them back first.

936
01:01:11,663 --> 01:01:16,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be just like, you know, if I sent a friend request to somebody, they don't have to agree to do it.

937
01:01:18,045 --> 01:01:21,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So why just leave it as yes, no, instead of numbers?

938
01:01:21,847 --> 01:01:23,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why you have to complicate things.

939
01:01:23,627 --> 01:01:31,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Mori in our chat room live on this Sunday evening at chat.org.com says, It's a really flawed system, especially considering Nintendo's justification.

940
01:01:33,786 --> 01:01:37,370
[SPEAKER_03]: QWhat5565 says, Nintendo can't be that stupid.

941
01:01:37,651 --> 01:01:39,673
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to be coming out with an easier add-on.

942
01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:41,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a report button.

943
01:01:42,476 --> 01:01:42,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

944
01:01:43,898 --> 01:01:45,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, here, let me put it this way.

945
01:01:46,341 --> 01:01:49,385
[SPEAKER_02]: We still got time until the first, you know...

946
01:01:49,864 --> 01:01:50,645
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

947
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:12,842
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

948
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:33,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put yes or no.

949
01:02:33,508 --> 01:02:35,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is that so hard instead of having to enter in?

950
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:40,130
[SPEAKER_02]: People put their damn friend codes on websites anyways, and they exchange them that way.

951
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:43,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So how is that any different than yes or no?

952
01:02:44,152 --> 01:02:52,416
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what we should do is create a website, childmolesterfriendcodes.com, and encourage people to use the friend code systems to meet child molesters.

953
01:02:53,676 --> 01:02:55,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, I'm joking, people.

954
01:02:55,177 --> 01:02:57,758
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I mean, Loki brings up a good point.

955
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,222
[SPEAKER_03]: You can trade codes online with complete strangers who might turn out to be people you don't expect them to be.

956
01:03:04,482 --> 01:03:04,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

957
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:10,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it either because if someone ends up being creepy or something, you delete their friend code.

958
01:03:11,605 --> 01:03:14,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, for example, with Xbox Live, you just defriend them.

959
01:03:15,706 --> 01:03:17,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Or push the button that reports them.

960
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:18,287
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that hard.

961
01:03:18,367 --> 01:03:19,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I know a lot of people don't use it.

962
01:03:20,328 --> 01:03:21,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how hard is it?

963
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:25,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, people are going to send you stupid messages.

964
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:27,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's so hard to just delete them.

965
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:28,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

966
01:03:30,131 --> 01:03:31,492
[SPEAKER_02]: GS68 says, how to meet child molesters?

967
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,419
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

968
01:04:16,963 --> 01:04:25,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, wait, no, I can't do that, because I have to email all my damn friends now with the Wii system and say, hey, what's your friend code for Pokemon Battle Revolution?

969
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:27,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can't play you until, you know, I get this.

970
01:04:28,286 --> 01:04:32,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may take me a couple days before I'm actually able to play the game online with friends.

971
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:39,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray, mission accomplished, you've really, you know, embraced online.

972
01:04:40,268 --> 01:04:42,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think there's only one thing left to say about all of this.

973
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:58,563
[SPEAKER_03]: For the second week in a row inspired by Nintendo Friend Codes.

974
01:04:58,643 --> 01:05:00,764
[SPEAKER_03]: No DarkSakura tonight, so Loki, you get first dibs.

975
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,327
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU goes to drama.

976
01:05:04,587 --> 01:05:06,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate drama, and I hate drama that's unnecessary.

977
01:05:06,908 --> 01:05:08,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm leaving it at that for now.

978
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:12,552
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU goes to bullies.

979
01:05:13,032 --> 01:05:20,477
[SPEAKER_03]: They come in all shapes and sizes, and Fortune 500 sizes, and bullies are not cool.

980
01:05:21,198 --> 01:05:23,199
[SPEAKER_03]: and Double Standards suck as well.

981
01:05:23,339 --> 01:05:24,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hate Double Standards.

982
01:05:24,899 --> 01:05:33,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, really, really, really hate when you see one thing applied this way here and then it's applied totally or a blind eye is turned over here.

983
01:05:33,883 --> 01:05:34,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's stupid.

984
01:05:35,664 --> 01:05:36,004
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

985
01:05:36,324 --> 01:05:41,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess, do you have anything you want to share?

986
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:45,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so FU to Immaturity.

987
01:05:45,447 --> 01:05:47,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's pretty much it.

988
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:49,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to get into specifics.

989
01:05:51,102 --> 01:05:53,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Some very vague FUs this week.

990
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:56,163
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to the last Mimsy because it just got ridiculous towards the end.

991
01:05:56,583 --> 01:06:01,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Really ridiculous.

992
01:06:01,485 --> 01:06:06,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Some chatroom folks are entering honorary FUs on behalf of DarkSakura for not being here.

993
01:06:06,286 --> 01:06:08,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Joshi16 says, DarkSakura, FU to fucking drivers.

994
01:06:08,967 --> 01:06:09,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Drivers suck.

995
01:06:09,587 --> 01:06:09,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate them.

996
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:10,927
[SPEAKER_03]: They should die in a fire.

997
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:11,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingdom Hearts rules.

998
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:12,568
[SPEAKER_03]: No FU to them.

999
01:06:14,983 --> 01:06:15,644
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

1000
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:17,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Drunami says F you to e-sluts on Myspace.

1001
01:06:18,246 --> 01:06:19,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, amen.

1002
01:06:19,086 --> 01:06:21,829
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've been gone for four days, so I logged into Myspace.

1003
01:06:21,969 --> 01:06:23,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, 15 e-sluts.

1004
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:27,013
[SPEAKER_03]: That is going to kill Myspace, just like Slowness killed Friendster.

1005
01:06:27,473 --> 01:06:27,974
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.

1006
01:06:28,614 --> 01:06:33,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It would not be that hard for Myspace to institute some way to get around that.

1007
01:06:33,758 --> 01:06:35,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they kind of are right now.

1008
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:42,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they have that whole thing where you can know my last name and get around it that way, so I'm thinking about putting this big thing on my profile that says my last name is Roberts.

1009
01:06:43,817 --> 01:06:51,500
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because I've used my fake last name that I use on the radio on the MySpace profile so that people in my real life I don't want to find me can't find me because they don't know my stage name.

1010
01:06:52,081 --> 01:06:56,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking about just putting that really big so that the cam girls are fooled and they can't add me.

1011
01:06:56,063 --> 01:07:02,085
[SPEAKER_03]: At least turn it on for a little while and hopefully it will get them to stop hitting my profile.

1012
01:07:02,145 --> 01:07:02,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1013
01:07:03,466 --> 01:07:05,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do what I do, Robin.

1014
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:07,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not check MySpace after, you know...

1015
01:07:08,769 --> 01:07:09,169
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

1016
01:07:30,233 --> 01:07:33,996
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, there's that All Games community site, which is pretty rad as well.

1017
01:07:34,036 --> 01:07:37,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess, you should sign up for that because they talk games on there a lot.

1018
01:07:37,078 --> 01:07:38,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I did, but I guess I didn't.

1019
01:07:38,379 --> 01:07:38,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

1020
01:07:38,939 --> 01:07:39,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1021
01:07:39,279 --> 01:07:40,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe you did it while I've been gone.

1022
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't checked the site in a few days.

1023
01:07:42,201 --> 01:07:43,722
[SPEAKER_03]: There could have been some great blog posts.

1024
01:07:43,762 --> 01:07:44,223
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know.

1025
01:07:44,703 --> 01:07:48,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some game review haikus I have to catch up on for the community site.

1026
01:07:48,225 --> 01:07:50,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's community.allgames.com.

1027
01:07:50,627 --> 01:07:54,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Our buddies over there at All Games have set up their answer to Myspace.

1028
01:07:55,149 --> 01:07:57,791
[SPEAKER_03]: minus the camhors plus all the gaming chat.

1029
01:07:58,131 --> 01:07:58,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1030
01:07:58,611 --> 01:07:59,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's good times.

1031
01:07:59,752 --> 01:08:00,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I might have to go there.

1032
01:08:00,793 --> 01:08:03,334
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll probably get a lot of friend ads because OMG a chick.

1033
01:08:04,355 --> 01:08:05,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

1034
01:08:05,095 --> 01:08:05,696
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really.

1035
01:08:05,776 --> 01:08:07,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go in as a dude.

1036
01:08:07,557 --> 01:08:08,957
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a lot of cool people over there.

1037
01:08:08,998 --> 01:08:09,638
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good community.

1038
01:08:09,758 --> 01:08:17,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all listeners of this show and All Games and all the other shows that are on AllGames.com about the six or seven other indie podcasts they have that are on that network.

1039
01:08:17,983 --> 01:08:18,383
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's cool.

1040
01:08:18,823 --> 01:08:19,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

1041
01:08:19,404 --> 01:08:20,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll check it out.

1042
01:08:20,244 --> 01:08:20,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

1043
01:08:20,905 --> 01:08:21,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.

1044
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:27,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, TigerClaw wants to know if I checked the games and porn community site as well.

1045
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:31,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, All Games has these two spin-off community sites.

1046
01:08:31,552 --> 01:08:36,734
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is Rhythm Nation, which is for music-based games, and the other one is games and porn.

1047
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:41,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not looked at games and porn yet, but Rice Princess, that sounds right up your alley.

1048
01:08:41,476 --> 01:08:42,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It totally is.

1049
01:08:42,396 --> 01:08:43,136
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have to check that out.

1050
01:08:43,196 --> 01:08:44,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just the porn.

1051
01:08:44,657 --> 01:08:45,337
[SPEAKER_04]: That works too.

1052
01:08:46,318 --> 01:08:48,038
[SPEAKER_03]: So no more news this segment, Loki?

1053
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:51,660
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for Part A. Saving the good stuff for Part B?

1054
01:08:52,373 --> 01:08:53,014
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit, yeah.

1055
01:08:53,114 --> 01:08:53,394
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1056
01:08:53,635 --> 01:08:56,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we're going to take a little break here on Orange Launch Radio.

1057
01:08:56,157 --> 01:09:10,132
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back in a little bit with more, including our Part B. And if you listen to us on the podcast feed, keep in mind you have to wait just a couple days for Part B. That way you get your OLR spaced out throughout the week, so that way you get a little bit to get you through the workday or the commute or the jog.

1058
01:09:10,172 --> 01:09:14,457
[SPEAKER_03]: However you listen to us, you get a little bit on Mondays and you get a little more on Wednesdays.

1059
01:09:14,858 --> 01:09:19,383
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you guys listening live though, you only have to wait a few minutes and we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1060
01:09:19,764 --> 01:09:24,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1061
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:29,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
