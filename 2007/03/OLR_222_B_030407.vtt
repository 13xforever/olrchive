00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
And we are back on Orange Lounge Radio here with part B of our podcast or audio blog, audio cast, whatever you want to call it.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
It's the audio archive of our program and it's split up into two parts.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Part A is released usually early, early Monday morning, late Sunday night, however you want to look at it.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Part B comes out sometime on Wednesday whenever we get around to uploading it.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
But this is the second half of a continuing show that is taped live on Sunday nights.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
And if you feel like coming down for a show, you should join us.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
www.orangeloungeradio.com, we have a chat room, hi chat room.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
And you missed our great bonus segment and things you can only hear live or on our rebroadcast at allgames.com.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
We were playing porn or game and the sound effects were either from a porno or from a game.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
It was awesome.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
And we didn't do that well.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
We only got 8 out of 10 I think.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
So that was a B.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Jamie and I played together.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
It was hot.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
B for boobs.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Back into the news.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Starting off this segment with some pretty big news.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
It has to do with the Halo 3 beta.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Rumor is that the Halo 3 beta is going to be split into two sessions.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
The first session will begin on March 21st.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Seems pretty bold that these predictions are naming dates.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
But this is from Xbox Portugal who also brought the first Halo 3 beta screenshots.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
The first session will only be for those that got emails from Bungie.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
That starts March 21st.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
The second session will be also open to those who bought Crackdown.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
That will end in June but no start date given for that yet.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
But Loki, you were telling me during the break you heard this is bullshit.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, I heard it's bullshit.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
How was it proven wrong?

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
I think it was either someone at Microsoft or someone at Bungie that said that it would just be one giant session.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
That they weren't going to do two different ones.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Well there you have it.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
So Xbox Portugal lies.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Maybe not.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Miscommunications or you know.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah, Loki said Halo 3 would be coming out in the spring which was also a lie.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
So there you have it.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
That's alright, it happens.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Lies.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
You should be ashamed.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
No.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Something though that actually is pretty cool.

02:24.000 --> 02:34.000
As announced in OXM, the Halo theme is going to be a downloadable track for Guitar Hero 2.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
I think that's pretty cool.

02:38.000 --> 02:48.000
It's definitely going to be something that I think is going to get a lot of people to look more into those downloaded tracks.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
It's going to be something that's going to make a little bit of revenue so why not.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
It'll be cool.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Hey here it's going to be free.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Which makes sense.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
I like free.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
And yeah it would be a good promotion for the Halo 3 game.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
What I also want to know though is can Master Chief be one of the guitarists that you can play as.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
That would be cool.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
That would be awesome.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Because it was pretty awesome to have Master Chief in Dead or Alive 4.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Well it wasn't Master Chief.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Spartan.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Female Spartan.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Whatever.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
You know having a Halo character in the game was kind of funny.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
No.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Mistress Chief.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Sorry.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
My bad.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
Mistress Chief.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
That would be Chieftess.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Anyway.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
So yes.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
One of my favorite topics of discussion is how people are hacking firmwares on consoles.

03:32.000 --> 03:41.000
One very famous group, Team Executor, one of the ones I think pioneered some of the homebrew stuff on the PSP.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
Have broken the firmware for the Xbox 360.

03:46.000 --> 04:03.000
Now, right now there's apparently a, and they can't disclose too much, but there is a glitch in one of the older firmwares for the 360 that will allow you to use a copy of King Kong to run your own code.

04:03.000 --> 04:12.000
Kind of similar to what they're doing with some of the older firmwares on the PSP where you could run homebrew with Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

04:12.000 --> 04:22.000
Apparently one of the shaders I guess that was in King Kong was actually unsigned and so they could buffer overflow it and cause it to run their own stuff.

04:22.000 --> 04:33.000
And they actually released a proof of concept I think like Hello World or something like that that you can run on your 360 if you happen to have this firmware.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
And apparently there's a way to check it by going to your system menu and stuff like that.

04:37.000 --> 04:50.000
But like I said, if you're getting your automatic updates on live like most people are, you probably have already patched the hole in this because the problem has been patched in some of the future firmwares.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.000
Basically right now there's no way to roll back the firmware kind of like you can do on the PSP.

04:58.000 --> 05:08.000
Although if you have the older firmware there is apparently a thing you can break on the motherboard or something that you can do that will allow you to be able to roll it back no matter what firmware you have later on.

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
Can Microsoft just patch this right away?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
They can.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
They're pretty good.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
Of all the companies they're the fastest at closing up these loopholes real quick.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
At least on the 360 not so much Windows XP.

05:24.000 --> 05:34.000
And right now really I don't think there's a way you can really detect this because it's being run in a game almost.

05:34.000 --> 05:44.000
It's loading with a game so unless they just ban the use of King Kong altogether it's going to be pretty hard for them to stop it altogether.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
I don't know though.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
But they've already pretty much done.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
They've patched the hole for this.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
So I don't know there's not too much else I guess they can do right now about it.

05:55.000 --> 06:04.000
But anyways as I was going to say the first proof of concept they've got out there and this was I believe on QJNet was shown.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
At least they linked to it.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
I can't remember what it was.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
I think it's just a hello world type thing.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
Yeah hello world pretty much.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
This is some unsigned code.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
So that's kind of interesting it's I guess the Hypervisor vulnerability.

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
It's found in kernel versions 4532 and 4548.

06:28.000 --> 06:37.000
So apparently if you pull up your Xbox 360 under the system menu and look up system information.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
There's a little thing on the bottom of the screen that says D and then there's a bunch of numbers and then K and a bunch of numbers.

06:42.000 --> 06:56.000
If your kernel says 2.0 point and then the either the 40 or the what was it the 4532 4548 so yeah.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
That's kind of cool though.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
I mean got to start small and then they're just going to blow it up.

07:00.000 --> 07:13.000
But the rumor is also Team Executor is going to be releasing a actual PS3 thing that's going to launch ISO's off the hard drive once the European launch happens.

07:13.000 --> 07:21.000
So hopefully we'll see some more like that because I can't afford these expensive games.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
Oh yes because the rampant piracy will certainly make the games even better.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
That was sarcasm.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
Hasn't hurt the PS2 any more or the PSP.

07:33.000 --> 07:42.000
Well there are some franchises that every so often will rear their ugly heads in over the course of video gaming history.

07:42.000 --> 07:51.000
Well Ubisoft has released information on the new Prince of Persia game for the Xbox 360.

07:51.000 --> 07:59.000
Apparently it's going back to the roots of the game with more jumping around and grabbing stuff and climbing and things.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
And the prince is going to have a gauntlet instead of a knife.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
So it will be not so stabby oriented.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
God.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Prince of Persia not so stabby.

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
I was never a fan of the Prince of Persia game so I'm like wow.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
They're not bad. The new ones aren't bad.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
I don't think they're quite like oh my god as a lot of people said they are but I played some of the older ones on GameTap.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
They're not bad.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
For a 3D action type game they're pretty solid.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
It was a pretty good game and I don't know.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I can see why it does as well.

08:40.000 --> 08:48.000
They have the one coming off the Wii, the port of two thrones I guess but Rival swords they call it something new because they added some chariot racing in there.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
If you like Prince of Persia that's going to be a pretty cool game to check out.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
Another cool thing about Prince of Persia is it's becoming a movie as well.

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
Disney is behind this as well as Jerry Brockheimer.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
They're bringing Prince of Persia the Sands of Time and it is legit.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
They've got some concept art on it.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
That's pretty cool.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
Didn't Disney already put out Aladdin?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Yes.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
I think it would be a pretty cool action movie.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I'm looking forward to it.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Just don't fuck it up.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
If they pull it off you might have a really good movie translation for a game.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
It's been lacking lately.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Jamie, you're not a fan of the game but would the movie perk your interest?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Maybe it would work as a movie.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
No.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
That was very definitive. Why not?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Just not your thing?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
The Arabian Nights thing not your thing?

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
I've seen Aladdin and I watched the Sinbad movie back in the day when it was a tiny color.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Well shit.

09:59.000 --> 10:07.000
Anyway, of course you can download movies on iTunes and you can download music.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
For those wondering where's all the gaming music?

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
Electronic Arts has launched the EA Tracks service as a part of iTunes.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Basically what they've done is they've compiled all the EA games.

10:20.000 --> 10:29.000
The interesting thing is they've said music from all EA games past and present now available on the iTunes store.

10:29.000 --> 10:34.000
Well, okay, but when you say all EA games past and present that makes me go wow.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
You mean I could even go to the ECA games from the Commodore 64 days?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
No.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Basically what that means is your burnouts, your sports games with the licensed music, the Madden's.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Any of the games with EA Tracks.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
If you've got those EA Tracks you can download those songs on iTunes so there you go.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
Did you know that Burnout Dominator is supposed to have Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend in it?

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
Which, oh boy, that's a pretty bad song.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I like the last one she did for the movie.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
But.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
This song's bad.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
But.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
That's not something I would want the EA name on.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
Would it make you want to crash into things?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
That's a very good point.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
It's true that there's pedestrians in the next Burnout game.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
It would make me want to run over them.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Dominator would not have pedestrians.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Dammit.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
Dominator is kind of a best of built off the Revenge Engine I believe.

11:26.000 --> 11:31.000
Well we have our own Revenge Engine built into Orange Lounge Radio and that is our mailbag.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
When you guys don't like something you heard on the show, or you know when you like something you heard on the show.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
You can send us an email to mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

11:39.000 --> 11:45.000
and DarkSakura will open up the email bag and pull out some of her favorite emails to read here live on the program.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
And I believe this week we got a lot of emails didn't we DarkSakura?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Uh yeah but I picked only a few.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
So please don't be offended if your email is not read on air because some, you know it's weird.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Some weeks we get nothing, some week we get a bunch.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
There's a few I'd like to go back and repost.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
Probably on Tuesday I'll have them up on the site as well as the one from last week.

12:05.000 --> 12:10.000
Alright well let's play the cute little theme music so we can get into the emails that you did select for this week.

12:17.000 --> 12:25.000
The first email of the week without the sexy commentary actually comes from...

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Email number one.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Hey Rob shut up.

12:29.000 --> 12:37.000
Um comes from uh Heon. Uh dear OLR first of all I absolutely love the show you guys are excellent radio show hosts and are very talented.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Thank you so much for making the show so fun by interacting with your audience.

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
Onto my questions Super Mario Brothers Ocarina of Time, Kid Icarus, A Link to the Past.

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
These are just several of the classics that are currently available on the North American Virtual Console.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
It's been only four months.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
The Wii still has four to five years to go.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
At this rate they're going to be scraping the bottom of the barrel near the end of its life.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
I know that Nintendo's got a significant amount of masterpieces still to release on Virtual Console.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
But are they going too fast?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Sincerely Heon.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
P.S. Um I am now a Pastafarian thanks to the show.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
FSM loves.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Flying Spaghetti Monster.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
Wow.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
I fear the day that Marissa has influence on anyone.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Um.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
All hail his noodly goodness.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Love you Marissa.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Anyhow actually I actually.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
She'll be up here in two weeks.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
She's coming back.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
A lot sooner than we thought so that's going to be a very interesting program.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Anyhow.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Back to the content of the email.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Um.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
What was the email about again?

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
About if Nintendo's releasing whatever Rob.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Virtual Console games coming out too fast or whatever's going on.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Um.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Right now.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
No.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
I mean keep in mind what we were talking about earlier in the program.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
That there's this big drought going on with the games.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
And although Reggie Fils-Aime lied and said we wouldn't have these droughts this time around.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
Keep in mind one thing he did say is that the Virtual Console releases, the big ones.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
Would supplement the lack of Wii games during these slow periods.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
So I think right now.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
No.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
They're not necessarily doing the Virtual Console games too fast.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
I think this was probably a pretty decent time to release Ocarina and Kid Icarus and some of those really big titles people want.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
I think when you get into November of this year when you know some of the bigger titles start coming out.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Hopefully your Mario Galaxy.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Probably your Metroid and so on and so on.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Um.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
You're probably going to see the Virtual Console releases get very slowed up.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Maybe you'll get one new game a week.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
From some obscure title.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
Like we're starting to see.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
You have to admit now on the TurboGrafx-16 and Genesis side.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
We're really starting to dip into the obscure games coming out on Virtual Console.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I've never even heard of a lot of those games coming out.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Um.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.000
Especially but if they're going to open up the door to Commodore 64.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
As I believe the rumor had said before that Commodore 64 is a possibility coming.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
And as well as MSX and so on.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Especially if they blow up in that Commodore 64 door.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
That is going to be a shitload of games that they can add there as well.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I guess it would depend on what publishers.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Um.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
I think there's still a lot of room for Virtual Console to go.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Uh.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
And hopefully someday we'll start getting the multiplayer add-ons.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Maybe some of our games will be enabled for multiplayer slowly but surely.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Maybe we'll get our cheat codes.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
I could see that as something that happens slowly but surely in 2008.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I want Icarus to fight Medusa Angels.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
And I want my Justin Bailey in Metroid.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
And hopefully originals too.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Don't we want some Wii originals?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Some more original Wii games?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Heck yeah.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
That would be hopefully where the console goes in 2008 and 2009.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
So we will see what happens.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Next email is very special.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Dear OLR crew, my name is Rama from Indonesia.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I am a classic video game lover.

15:31.000 --> 15:37.000
I believe that I am probably the first person from Indonesia becoming one of your loyal fans.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Right now I have to know.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
I'm going to check stats.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Right now I'm working as a journalist and most of my articles about technology and video games.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
I'm also working as a local video game music composer.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
One thing that will probably surprise you that I am blind.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
I was born with only 10% sight ability after being operated.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Now how can I operate a computer?

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm using screen reader that enables me to read object shown on my laptop so I can read and write,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
browse the internet, and even download your show.

16:02.000 --> 16:07.000
When I was a child I was so interested in video games because it had attractive sounds and graphics.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
I even owned an Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, NES, Genesis, and SNES.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
With only 10% sight I could still enjoy classic games.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
I could not recognize objects or details, but I could still understand, for instance,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
which one is my hero and which one is the enemy.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
I even finished many famous classic games such as Super Mario series, Contra, Gradius,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Sonic series, and many more.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
But when 3D gaming era came out, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Saturn,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
I decided to give up because I could not play games with so many movements.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
After that I decided to enjoy video games in other fashions.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
I started to record or collect music from games I played.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I'll share with you some of my listening later.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
So now on to my comments about you guys.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Scroll down.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Well, I could not say a word but awesome.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
Your podcast is the first experience enjoying video games news on an audio forum.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
I actually found your site last January and started to become your fan.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
I even quoted some of your information in my articles.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
Sky Logie and DarkSakura, you are the craziest gang I have ever loved.

17:10.000 --> 17:17.000
I feel like having lots of friends video game folks that refreshes my energy and brain during the working hour.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
You should know that not many Indonesians have intention to talk about video games that much.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
And man, your other soldiers are awesome too.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
I suggest that you go on this way and besides video games, bring along more laughter and joy.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Oh, that's so sweet. There's more.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Wow.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
Those are reasons I keep downloading your show even though Indonesian internet connection is like a turtle crawling along the beach.

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
That requires more than 12 hours to download your A and B segment.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
But that's fine as I can enjoy your show.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
I don't know if this one will ever interest you but have you ever tried audio games?

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
This is another genre of gaming which was built specifically for the blind so they can play games too.

17:51.000 --> 17:57.000
There are many kinds of games such as card games with voice, chess and even more advanced platforms like RPG, spaceship battle games.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It takes advantage of stereo sound systems.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
For example, if you're playing spaceship battle game and your enemy is on your left,

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
you can hear their ship on your left speaker and can shoot them.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
You can also chase them if they dodge your attack.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Let's say they move from left to right.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I'm going to scroll down.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Again, pay attention to the speaker.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
And it did something like that with that Atari controller that you use your forehead to play.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
And Sega did a couple of audio only games on the Saturn.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
You can try them here. It's at audiogames.net.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I wonder if it can be Dark Sakura Side of the Week.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
We'll see.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Well, I think that's all I can share.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I hope I keep in touch with you guys.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
This email can be read on air.

18:35.000 --> 18:42.000
As for joining your show via Skype, I think it is difficult because the connection, like I've mentioned before, is very slow to make such a call.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Plus the time difference.

18:44.000 --> 18:52.000
Lastly, I'm working on an Xbox 360 project along with a local game developer at max-studio.net to produce independent games.

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
Well, I don't really know about the program, but I heard that Microsoft is holding a contest for XNA Game Engine to produce games for 360.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
So I hope I can do well.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Good luck for you guys.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
I will probably make an interview and write more about your show later.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
P.S. I love Chicken Shoot.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
It's signed by Rama.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
I think that came up the week you weren't here, Dark Sakura.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
There was a game called Chicken Shoot.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
Wow, what an amazing email.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
That was really cool.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
There's a lot that we take for granted sometimes, I think.

19:23.000 --> 19:32.000
Emails like this can be very humbling in a way that sometimes we take for granted our mega fast internet connections we have, our site that we have to play video games.

19:32.000 --> 19:44.000
You know what's interesting is actually this person is not the first person I've heard on a gaming podcast talk about the difficulty of being legally blind, so to speak.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
Just because you're legally blind doesn't mean you can't see it all.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Like this guy said, he has 10% vision.

19:50.000 --> 19:58.000
It makes perfect sense for things that are 2D with minimal movement going on to be much easier to see than our 3D games.

19:58.000 --> 20:14.000
I imagine that actually it might even be easier to see the smaller sprites, the collection of sprites as they'll have a cleaner color palette than even things moving around in life.

20:14.000 --> 20:22.000
We take our vision for granted, just all the things that go on around us but the moment that it's gone.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
That's actually a good thing that I think is really neat about this audio game.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
This goes back to my love of the Discovery Channel.

20:30.000 --> 20:43.000
They were talking about how they had a group of blind people riding their bicycle down the road using clicking to determine location of cars and other things in the road.

20:43.000 --> 21:02.000
Their study group actually managed to avoid children running out on the road, avoided trash in the street by using their sense of hearing to determine space relation around them.

21:02.000 --> 21:13.000
They say that if you lose one capability, your other capabilities become so much more sensitive so that really makes sense I think.

21:13.000 --> 21:20.000
I'd be very curious what this listener has to think about the Wii because he does have at least the 10% sight.

21:20.000 --> 21:29.000
The Wii is interesting because it has that rumble and the speaker that's actually in the Wiimote as well as the rumble depending on where your cursor is on screen.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
It could help you identify if you're pointing at a certain object.

21:32.000 --> 21:45.000
I imagine not all games would work but I'm kind of curious could the Wii maybe be something that would help bring the sky back into gaming where the 3D games and the ultra-intensive graphics have made him unable to play.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
I would have never known about this type of sight and the way they make these games.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
I guess I'm just ignorant that way. I would have never known how to not pay for this email.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Thank you very much for the email.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
I'm going to check that site out just because I want to know.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
I want to see what kind of games there are.

21:59.000 --> 22:08.000
There have been other games and I don't think they were necessarily brought out for the blind in particular but Sega, there were a number of Saturn games that focused only on audio.

22:08.000 --> 22:15.000
There was one game that came with a packet of seeds where you had to use the audio to raise a plant.

22:15.000 --> 22:22.000
Very interesting. Alpha Canagram reminds us and SSG100 Matt chimes in too about how Ellen actually gave a blind kid a Wii on her show.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Remember that? That was some gaming news a while back.

22:24.000 --> 22:31.000
That was before the Wii's were even out. So kind of an interesting reminder there from the chat room.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
That's why we love chat because they remember things and we don't.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
This next email comes from Bear Who Drive Car.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
I love that name.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
That's so great. French fries, sorry.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
Okay, I have to stop for just a minute. Loki, what the hell is it? You have DDR fifth mix on your PSP?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Yeah.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
What are you hacking over there?

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
I was putting the PS1 image on here.

22:52.000 --> 22:59.000
God, I'm so far behind on my PlayStation. Dang, you mean if I get a card you can do that with PlayStation 1 games for my PSP?

22:59.000 --> 23:07.000
Yeah, you put a custom firmware on there and you can convert any PS1 image to play on a PSP given that you have the big enough...

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
Now my next question for you is why the fuck do you have DDR on your PSP?

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
So I can play with the controller. That's how I play normally.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Back to the emails.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Sorry.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
Anyway, yo, just writing to vent about the Wii. I do like it, but you guys mentioned that there are too many controllers.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Well, I can't agree more.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
First I got Super Mario Brothers with the Wii mode.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
It's kind of odd because of the shape and size, but that was okay.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
Then I got Smash Brothers Melee and all of a sudden to play multiplayer I needed two GameCube controllers.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Okay, not too bad.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
Then I bought Contra and that's when I noticed if you try to play with the GameCube controller...

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
No, I try to play with the GameCube controller, but if you recall the locations, the YB on SNES and Game Boy controllers are totally different.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
By the way, I hate the GameCube controller and it's asymmetrically sized buttons.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
So now I have to buy a Wii Classic Controller, two for multiplayer.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I've also purchased three Wiimotes and four Nunchucks.

23:58.000 --> 24:08.000
So Nintendo Wii $250, three Wiimotes $120, four Nunchucks $80, two GameCube controllers $40, two Wii Classic controllers $40.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
Spending $530 to play a glorified GameCube, priceless.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
Fanboys claiming the Wii is a value system cannot be more wrong.

24:17.000 --> 24:24.000
I get the point, but at the same time you didn't have to buy the controllers.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
You just didn't like the way it felt on the GameCube controllers.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
And again, you're not forced to even buy Contra or any Super Nintendo game at all.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
Whereas PlayStation 3, you have to buy a Blu-ray drive, like it or not.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
Granted, I'm comparing apples to oranges a little bit here,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
but I think that's where your point kind of has a little bit of a flaw.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
You're saying that you feel you have to buy these to have that.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
And again, I don't have four Wii controllers.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I probably didn't even really need to get a second one.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
I just did it because we usually have a lot of people over and I wanted to play Wii Tennis.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
But ideally, a lot of people have their own Wiimotes and so on and so on.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
I do get what you're saying though.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
There are a lot of hidden fees, but you kind of get that with every console.

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
PlayStation 3 doesn't come with a component cable, if I remember right.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
Wasn't that something we covered on a previous show that actually didn't come with the component or HDMI cable?

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
PlayStation 3 only came with the other one.

25:18.000 --> 25:26.000
Xbox 360, granted their premium unit is much better than their core unit, coming with a lot of the basics.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
But if you want to get a wireless headset, that's more money.

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
And I say, yeah, you kind of do need that wireless headset if I want to play DDR or so on.

25:34.000 --> 25:40.000
Anyhow, interesting point, but I think a slightly flawed one.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I don't know.

25:42.000 --> 25:50.000
I think that there's something to it, but it all depends on how far you'll go for the sake of convenience.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Anyway, next email comes up.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.000
Actually, granted, could I just say some quick points from chat that came up here?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Let's see, what's going on?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Leon wants to start a fight here.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
You are not good enough for the GameCube controller, you noob.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
And Blay says, boo-fucking-hoo, do your research before you buy a system.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
So a couple of people throw in some rocks there.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
SkyWarrior, that's with a Y, not an I.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.000
Says, value, what makes the Wii so compelling?

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
Too bad the PlayStation 3 has no value as of now.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Very interesting.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
And some interesting comments there from the chat room there.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
James Patrick says, a lot of Wii games only need one remote, and you pass it around.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
So, kind of interesting there. Ooh, food.

26:28.000 --> 26:37.000
And also they have games coming out now like Wing Island and Koro Impa that use one remote and Nunchuck for two players.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
So they've got all that stuff going on.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.000
Jamie's got them out. I don't want that now after you put your mouth all over it.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I only ate off one side of it.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
It's fine. It doesn't look that good anyway.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I'm starting South Beach tomorrow again.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Anyway.

26:52.000 --> 26:58.000
This email actually is not the last one. It comes from Nekky.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
Really the one thing that I wanted to go in here.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
And it's a really long email, and this is going to be one that I'm going to leave on the website.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
But I wanted to mention this.

27:08.000 --> 27:17.000
I like the idea of telling people, now you have posted a site plug for you on my home forum, dscommunity.co.uk, to plug the site for them.

27:17.000 --> 27:25.000
And Xbox 360 Fanatics link is z6.envisionfree.com slash 360 underscore fanatics slash index dot php.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
We are currently quite small, but invite everyone to join no matter where you are.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
And that includes you, Jamie, Loki, and Rob.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
I wanted to do that, though, just because Nekky writes us regularly.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
And I'm going to be posting this in the thing, but I thought that it would be nice for me to go ahead and give the little plug.

27:43.000 --> 27:52.000
I remember the first email from the taped segment was a loving rant about the last few episodes.

27:52.000 --> 27:59.000
I do feel slightly likewise, but I agree with you, Jamie and Rob, that it does keep your show unique.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.000
Inviting Casper the Gay and Rice Princess every week may not be such a good idea, though.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
I do not hold anything against them, but having them on every week would alter many people's views of your show.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Well, that's why these folks are guests, not hosts.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Well, you said it out of love, not hate.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Gotcha.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.000
Anyway, that one's going to get reposted.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
Sorry, I'm actually trying to do a search. I want to see where this post comes up.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
I'm looking at this site. It's dscommunity.co.uk.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
It's a whole little DS, and I imagine there's lots of friend code training going on.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
Oh, here it is.

28:29.000 --> 28:34.000
There's actually a forum called Plug a Site, and there's this post there.

28:34.000 --> 28:39.000
Great site for podcasts and live shows focusing on video gaming.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
Past available on iTunes, MP3 download available on actual website.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Covers release dates for most of the world.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Most are accurate, as they have insider sources.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
One of the guys works for a game distribution company.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Good fun to listen to, especially when you have nothing to do or on a commute.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
I like that. Orange Launch Radio, better than nothing.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Yeah.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
No, thank you very much for the plug.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
We appreciate that.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
You are a true veteran of the O.L. Army, and we salute you.

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
We got an email from Gaming Nerd about...

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Nerd.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Hey, now.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
Anyway, from Gaming Nerd, it says,

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
Hey, O.L.R., I know this is kind of a risky subject to mention,

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
but I feel it must be heard so that people understand what could be happening in the future in gaming.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
After listening to Loki's rant in the last week's episode about there not being any good games for PS3 and 360,

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
and only average ones, it got me looking back at the numerous anonymous sites that I've been to.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Excuse me.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
I'm finding it pretty easy to download pirated PS2 and Xbox games off the net,

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
and bringing them to DVDRs and playing them on modded consoles.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
Knowing how easy it is to download PS2 and Xbox games,

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
it gets you wondering just how much money game companies are losing just from these two consoles.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
With that loss in money,

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
there's only so much money that can be spent to produce average titles of the kind of graphics power

29:53.000 --> 29:57.000
and development tools that are provided for the PS3 and 360.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
It's no wonder the Wii is overtaking the competition with its console

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
for the simple reason that the GameCube ran games off unique media that wasn't easily accessible to the public.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
Thus, more money was earned through the sales in the games for the GameCube,

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
and money being able to produce the awesomeness that is the Wii and its games.

30:15.000 --> 30:23.000
Also, something I should point out is that Nintendo has been notorious for proprietary software

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
for their storage capacity.

30:27.000 --> 30:33.000
This is probably one of the reasons why I think Square jumped ship with them with the Final Fantasy franchise.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
It'll only be a matter of time before we see a Blu-ray burner and PS3 games get pirated.

30:38.000 --> 30:44.000
A mod ship is released to the console, which will result in even more money lost to the companies that make their games for the PS3.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
I'm even more surprised the Japanese market isn't complaining about piracy,

30:48.000 --> 30:53.000
but that you could only mean there's much more loyal to gaming than some of us here in the States.

30:53.000 --> 30:58.000
Especially when it comes to buying my PS2 imports, I'm more than willing to spend $64 to buy games like Puyo Puyo Fever 2,

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
Melty Blood, DDR Supernova, BeatMania 2DX, and supporting the companies that made these games.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
And like most people that I've heard who just go ahead and download imports,

31:06.000 --> 31:13.000
since they either can't find a store that sells them or don't want to spend an extra $14 off everyday $50 US titles,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
they might have just come out.

31:15.000 --> 31:20.000
Anyways, I hope this letter gives a better understanding as to why big names aren't really as big anymore,

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
as it partially is due to the loss of money and loss of quality for the games themselves.

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
I can remember when it was really big news for a game like Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo, and Final Fantasy to get new sequels,

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
but nowadays it's just the same thing because there isn't enough money to do much else in the games.

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
Unique aspects are gone and there's not much else we can say about gaming other than stop the piracy and the magical return.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
You're truly a gaming nerd.

31:44.000 --> 31:50.000
Very often you hear from people who are willing to defend the fact that video game piracy is a bad thing.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
So, very interesting email.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
Don't copy that floppy, as a famous musician once said.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.000
Loki, I'm curious what your feedback is on this whole piracy is bad for the industry angle.

32:02.000 --> 32:10.000
Sure, it's bad for the industry, but to be honest, nowadays a lot of the stuff, if it's not worth playing,

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
I won't even go and pirate it or anything like that. I'll just not play it.

32:14.000 --> 32:21.000
But, I mean, I guess I buy normally, I mean, I buy a lot of stuff that just comes out

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
and I find out, you know, the hard way that a lot of the games do suck.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
So I can see where a lot of people get burned by these games that, you know, get great reviews

32:29.000 --> 32:35.000
and they're like, what the fuck? This is crap. Driver 3, for example.

32:35.000 --> 32:43.000
Yeah, piracy is, especially if you make it so easy, like it is on the PlayStation 2, or even the original PlayStation,

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
yeah, it's going to be a huge issue, but I don't know. It's all morals.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
If you think stealing is bad, then you're not going to do it, but, you know.

32:51.000 --> 32:58.000
Bandit says, bad for the industry, but good for Loki, in our chat room.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
GS68 says, I buy legit copies, though I admit I've done my share of ROM downloading.

33:03.000 --> 33:10.000
I think ROMs are not quite as bad. In fact, they're really not as bad, because usually the things you're pirating ROMs of.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
I mean, if you're doing current DS games, that's one thing, but if you're downloading ROMs of, you know,

33:15.000 --> 33:22.000
years old, you know, Commodore 64 and NES games that folks aren't going to be, you know, playing anytime soon,

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
or selling anytime soon, that's not as bad.

33:25.000 --> 33:31.000
For the record, I have DDR5 mix at home. I just don't have a copy that'll work on my PSP.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.000
You might say Virtual Console makes ROMs bad, but I don't know. I'll admit, I've downloaded my fair share of ROMs.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
Charging $5 for an NES game makes Virtual Console bad.

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
I have a ROM of Kid Icarus on my computer. I don't like to play Kid Icarus on my computer.

33:47.000 --> 33:53.000
I like to play it on my television like I did when I was a kid, so for that, it was worth the $5 to me,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
because I love Kid Icarus that much.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
To be honest, I've got to play PS1 games on my PSP, because what else am I going to play?

33:59.000 --> 34:05.000
Grand Theft Auto? I mean, seriously, what else is out for the PSP?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
A whole lot of stuff I'm not interested in.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
It sounds like a lot of stuff coming soon, though.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Soon. It's always coming soon.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Ah, whatever, whatever.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Anyway, may I read the next email?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
You sure may.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
Thank you. Last email.

34:19.000 --> 34:25.000
Hiya, guys. I just want to know what it is that we in Europe and Australia have done to piss off Sony.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
Whatever it was, I'm sure we could apologize.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
It's the funny accents.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
No, shut up.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
Maybe come to some kind of arrangement.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
You don't get this kind of treatment in America.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
How come? Is it cash, bribes, sexual favors?

34:40.000 --> 34:44.000
I'm sure you know why it is I'm feeling hard done by.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
I was accepting of the higher price tag. We are used to that.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Also, the late release date.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I've only just bought my copy of Final Fantasy XII.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
We're used to having to wait, but waiting longer to pay extra for an inferior piece of hardware is taking the biscuit.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Full backwards compatibility.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Well, there's another thing. You call it a biscuit.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
I mean, come on.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
Rob!

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
The expression is take the cake.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, shut up.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.000
What?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
I'm just, obviously I'm kidding. Come on.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Stuff it!

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
Thank you.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
I'm going to flip Jamie off the British way. There you go.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Up your arse.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Hey, two fingers salute for you.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
You're being a real tit.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Don't be such a tit.

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
I'm done. I promise.

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
To use a bit of proper colloquialism. Rob's doing my head in here.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
So shall I continue?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
I suppose.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
Okay. Wanker.

35:43.000 --> 35:51.000
Full backwards compatibility was one of the biggest selling points for the PS2 for me and would have been on the PS3.

35:51.000 --> 36:00.000
Being able to play a session of San Andreas and putting on Bishi Bashi Special if mates come over without switching consoles or messing with wires is important to me.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
I'm starting to wonder whether Sony actually wants to sell any consoles over here.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
PS3s are available on pre-order from every UK shop and website.

36:07.000 --> 36:14.000
No one is worried about shortages because there are none and there is a conspicuous lack of interest in the approaching release.

36:14.000 --> 36:19.000
Is there any way of getting an import yet or have Sony still got sniffer dogs in customs?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
IBOs maybe?

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
Asiya Lee, Marketing Manager, OLR, UK Division.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Oh, yes. This guy.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Yes.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Amazing work.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
Bandit calls this whole thing bux.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
That's a bandit has to say about it.

36:35.000 --> 36:39.000
I offered you some. Don't give me that look.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
What?

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
You're looking at my cupcake and then I ate that big thing of icing.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
It looks like a yummy cupcake, but I don't want it.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
I offered you some.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Cupcakes make me fat. I don't want it.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
You put your fingers all over that cupcake.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
You haven't even like torn off the paper.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
You've just dived into the cupcake.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
I asked you if you wanted some and you said no so I started licking the ice.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Don't be such a twat.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
You're being a real twat.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Wanker.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
Anyway, no seriously.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
I think the reason why Europe gets shit on is I think they sell the least amount of consoles there.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
The end.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Right? Am I right?

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
No.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Loki says I'm wrong.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I would think that's what it is.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I don't know.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
Don't they sell more consoles in Japan and America than they do in Europe?

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Maybe.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
I guess it depends what you consider to be Europe.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
Do you consider Europe to be everything on the other side of the Atlantic?

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
Or do you consider Europe to be, you know...

37:35.000 --> 37:40.000
I just think that they think that their US and Japan markets are more important than their UK markets.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
They want to make sure they have enough consoles for us because we're spending more money on games.

37:44.000 --> 37:54.000
I always said the TVs too because the Japan and US share the same TV format standard whereas NTSC...

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
It doesn't matter with HD.

37:56.000 --> 38:00.000
If Sony's really pushing the HD format then having PAL or NTSC is not going to matter.

38:00.000 --> 38:09.000
But not everybody has an HD TV yet so the systems have to work with the old TVs whether they are whoring up the HD angle or not.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
That should be pretty easy to do though.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Just a thought.

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
You have to figure out what components they're going to take out of your PS3 so that they can lower the price on their end.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
That's what they have to do.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
All right. Well, we don't know.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
That's the Sony question we've given you our thoughts though.

38:28.000 --> 38:35.000
Regardless, it's not nice that they keep giving you the shot over there on the different games.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Rob.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
What?

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
I'm sorry. No.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
The international listeners ought to know I love them.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
I tease because I love.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
As somebody in chats, I don't even know who said this here.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
Who said my accents were so bad they were good?

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Somebody there said my accents are so bad.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
Oh, there it is.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
Sky Warrior says Sky's accents are so bad they're funny.

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
Uni says Sky's accents are like my mom trying to do a British accent and completely miserably failing at it.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.000
Oh, goodie.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
Now I'm like your mom.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
That's a very nice compliment.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Like your mom.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
It's like your mom.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Go leave that on an iTunes review.

39:16.000 --> 39:22.000
I want one of our British listeners to record that for us so that we can make a bumper out of it.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
We need to bring back the bumpers.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
I missed the bumper.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
It's like your mom.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
I could do that better.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
I could do that better.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
All right. Sorry.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
Forget it.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
No, seriously. I could.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Any more emails?

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
No.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Send us more.

39:37.000 --> 39:40.000
Send emails. My accent wants some fan mails.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
We need to do what this says.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
You lose because we say so.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
You're just crazy.

39:47.000 --> 40:01.000
Apparently the rumor is much like the online libraries, they are also withholding the Mii libraries for the Nintendo Wii from third-party developers

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
and not letting them develop games that will utilize the Miis,

40:05.000 --> 40:14.000
which is kind of disappointing because I would like to use my Miis in a lot more things than just Wii Sports or WarioWare, I guess.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I don't see why they don't.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Don't use your Miis in Grand Theft Auto.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Oh, my God. That would be awesome.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
That would be so cool.

40:22.000 --> 40:30.000
Even stuff like maybe your face or something on SSX Blur or something like that.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Create a character type thing.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Or your mom.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
Literally put your mom in the game.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Something like that, yeah.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
I don't know why they don't. I think it's stupid.

40:40.000 --> 40:46.000
But if it's anything like the online stuff was, they want to make sure they get it right first before they put it out to everybody.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
Which is a poor excuse if you ask me, but whatever.

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
I'm sure, like the online, it will be something that's implemented later on.

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
While it may not be happening now, it will happen later.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
Yeah, third-parties will get their Miis soon enough.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
Although I agree, they should have had it from the start.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
Well, GameTap, we mentioned in part A when I was talking about Myst online.

41:10.000 --> 41:16.000
What should be noted is that GameTap is also now starting to really get behind the independent game movement.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
Seems like a really good fit for GameTap, if you ask me.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
Well, GameTap has announced they're going to be doing a new indie game label.

41:23.000 --> 41:29.000
What they're going to do, they're going to sign and distribute any worthy indie project over the GameTap service.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.000
This would be a really great way to get your game out there, because GameTap has their user base.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
They won't say how big it is, which makes me think it's not that big.

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
I don't know, I guess a lot of people are still not willing to fork over the $10 a month to pay the games.

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
But this would be a really great way for GameTap to get more games that you can't get other places.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
I think it's a really good fit for GameTap and a smart thing for them to be doing right now.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
If you want more information, GameTap.com.

41:53.000 --> 42:00.000
They will also probably be announcing, I believe I read somewhere else, not this particular article I'm looking at now.

42:00.000 --> 42:06.000
I believe they announced somewhere else that a game developer conference are going to announce the first batch of games that are going to be on the indie label.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
So that's kind of cool.

42:08.000 --> 42:11.000
So, Loki, is this something that might get you on GameTap finally?

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
Nope. I don't have time to be paying for online monthly subscriptions for games.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
I thought I'd ask anyway.

42:18.000 --> 42:24.000
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I was just choking up a baby.

42:24.000 --> 42:30.000
Okay. Apparently this show has that effect on people.

42:30.000 --> 42:37.000
I'm sorry. I just coughed up a baby listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

42:37.000 --> 42:44.000
They were talking about babies flying out of vaginas in one part and in the second part they coughed up a baby.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
It's amazing.

42:46.000 --> 42:53.000
Okay. There is some love coming out thanks to SNK.

42:53.000 --> 43:01.000
Art of Fighting actually is going to be having a collection to be released stateside.

43:01.000 --> 43:09.000
Art of Fighting was a very interesting game because it was a big definite knockoff in some respects of Street Fighter II,

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
what with, you know, Rio and, you know, Robert Garcia and all of them.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
Two of them also gave us Dan and later ones too.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
But, I don't know. It's kind of cool.

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
I always liked Art of Fighting because they did name a fighter after me.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
Having a rob in a fighting game was pretty cool.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
I also like that old school zoom in and out effect it did.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Art of Fighting, though, gave us King.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
That's right.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
And King was awesome.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Big ol' lesbian.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
And Yuri with the flying butt attack.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
Got a lot of flying butt attacks.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
In fact, I'm going to do a flying butt attack on Dark Sakura right now.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.000
Get your ass off me.

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I've been rubbed with gay ass.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
Anyways, if you like ridiculous weapons much like Rob's flying butt attack,

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
then you're definitely going to love Worms HD, which is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Speaking of ass worms.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
Finally, this Wednesday.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
So, that is awesome.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
It's supposed to be 800 Microsoft points or $10 in real money.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
And it's awesome.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
It's Worms.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
It's 2D.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
And, yeah, I can't wait to play it.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
It's about fucking time this game came out to Xbox Live Arcade.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Exploding Sheep, no Holy Hand Grenade.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
That's the only disappointment for me, but that is still a fucking awesome game.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
Oh, Lord, bless this thy hand grenade.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
Well, what could also be very awesome for Xbox Live Arcade would be Sam and Max.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
And there are rumors abounding.

44:41.000 --> 44:46.000
There's been for a little while that Sam and Max, of course, again, we mentioned GameTap earlier.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.000
It's kind of all coming together now.

44:47.000 --> 44:52.000
The new Sam and Max adventures, I believe the most recent one was Episode 4, Abe Lincoln Must Die.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
The rumor is that these Sam and Max games might be ported over to Xbox Live Arcade.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
Now, Telltale Games finally said something this week about the whole thing.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
They said they will, quote,

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
look closely at releasing a potential Sam and Max project.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
Quote,

45:06.000 --> 45:14.000
We can confirm that we are hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, although we do not have any official Xbox project announcements to share right now.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
Well, I would think if they're hiring an Xbox 360 programmer, they've got something planned.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
And what else would be better than a Sam and Max game?

45:21.000 --> 45:25.000
I guess, granted, it doesn't have to be the same games that GameTap is getting,

45:25.000 --> 45:31.000
but certainly bringing the Sam and Max series to Xbox Live Arcade, I'm sure Microsoft would be all over that.

45:31.000 --> 45:37.000
Well, something that our listeners are all over week in and week out is DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
DarkSakura surfs the internet up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
I don't know what that meant.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Every week.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
And she finds a website suitable to share with all of you.

45:47.000 --> 45:57.000
We call it DarkSakura's Website of the Week.

45:57.000 --> 46:01.000
My Website of the Week is a marvelously special one.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
It is Marvel.com, which I've been spending a whole shitload of time on,

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
downloading, I'm actually mostly just downloading wallpaper.

46:09.000 --> 46:16.000
But they have, I think it's cool, they actually have some of the, I'd say comics from like a few months ago,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
uploaded so that you can read them.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
They have links to the toys, the movie news.

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
There's blogs up there, podcasts, stuff for mobile.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
It's actually pretty cool.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.000
I've been pretty happy with it.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
So I'd say check it out.

46:32.000 --> 46:38.000
It's really fun for a commercial site.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
All right.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
What are you surprised?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
No, I'm just, I'm reading chat.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
I'm arguing with Black Wolf right now in chat.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
Hey Rob, do your job.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
Loki's friend is fighting me in chat right now.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
Loki's one friend saying that it's going to be hard to fit Sam and Max on Xbox Live Arcade

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
because of the size limit.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
And I said, well, they upped the size limit to 250 megabytes, remember?

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
And Black Wolf says, yes, they'd have to make it more though.

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
And Black Wolf says, I just don't want 360 people to get my Sam and Max heart game tab.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
So that's sort of true.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
You don't want people to have your Loki, and you don't want people to have your Sam and Max.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
You are a very possessive individual, Mr. Bobby Black Wolf.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
I'm nobody's person, so, eh.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
By the way, Bobby does his own show, Sunday Nights on All Games Radio.

47:24.000 --> 47:29.000
A lot of our live listeners kind of see it as a pre-show to Orange Lounge Radio in some ways.

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
No, just teasing.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Our shows complement each other very well.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Bobby also is a big fan of the music games.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
You can check his show out at allgames.com.

47:36.000 --> 47:41.000
And listen to him stalk Loki on his program.

47:41.000 --> 47:51.000
Anyways, so apparently they've spotted a couple games on the Vice, or, I see VC and I think Vice City.

47:51.000 --> 47:59.000
Virtual Console Servers, because I know you can still do that little hack with the web browsers to view what's on those.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
But anyways, two games that have been spotted.

48:02.000 --> 48:08.000
One of them being Elevator Action, which is pretty awesome, and then Tech Mobile.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
No it's not.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
Elevator Action sucks.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
It's one of those games people remember.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
No, I'm talking about Tech Mobile.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Oh, Tech Mobile's awesome.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Yeah, fuck Elevator Action.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
Tech Mobile on the NES was awesome, but Tech Mobile on the arcade was not so awesome.

48:20.000 --> 48:25.000
Because I have the Tech Mobile arcade game on some Tech Mobile collection I had on the Xbox randomly.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
But Tech Mobile on the NES was pretty rad.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
So I'm looking forward to seeing that.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
That would be pretty cool.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Elevator Action, not so much.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Elevator Action was not that good.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
It's just people remember it because, ooh, it's a game with elevators.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
You don't see that a lot.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
I really wish they would have new Rob.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Even though Keystone Capers was a long time before it.

48:42.000 --> 48:47.000
They need a Rob the Robot that plugs into one of your Wii U remotes.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
And then they need to release those games on there.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
Because I think that would be funny.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Like a little miniature Rob the Robot.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
They don't need it.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
Yes they do.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Because I want Rob the Robot.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Why?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
Rob the Robot.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
For those two shit games they had for it.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
I mean to re-release Rob the Robot.

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
They can make new games.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
Do Rob 2.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
How about Rob Roberts, the bot?

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
That'd be good.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
No.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
They need to bring back.

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
How about a Jamie bot where it just nags you to do things?

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
That would be a woman bot, okay?

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Turn on your system.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Download this upgrade.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
No.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
I only called you once to ask you to turn on your aims.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
I'm going to send you the fucking pre-show.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Do not be a bitch to Rob.

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Turn on your AOL.

49:29.000 --> 49:36.000
If you think that I'm going to download your updates for you, you're completely wrong.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I'm an independent woman.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
I'll do what I want.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
I'm shutting off in the middle of your game now.

49:43.000 --> 49:48.000
Wow.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.000
I love this show.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I really, really love this show.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
My battle aura.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
All your memes have been deleted.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
I have a power level of over 4,000 now, Rob.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
I love you, Jamie.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
The hell you do.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
And Jamie bot.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
The hell you do.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
You treat me like this.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Look.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Here.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Look.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
Jamie, I got a story that'll make you happy because I know you love Zork and Leisure Suit

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Larry.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Who doesn't love Leisure Suit?

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
No.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
And King's Quest?

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
Actually, I never really played any of them except for the first Zork.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
Can't you just play along?

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Vodka.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I don't think Vodka was a game.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Okay.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
How about the Indiana Jones games?

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Vodka Cures PMS.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
Maniac Mansion?

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
I love Maniac Mansion.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
There we go.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Well, Maniac Mansion, I'm sure there'll be a mention of it at Adventure Con.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
But news alert.

50:36.000 --> 50:42.000
Adventure Con is an adventure game convention that's going to happen August 28th and 29th

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
at the Mirage Hotel right on the Vegas Strip.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
It's going to be two days of adventure game nerdom.

50:48.000 --> 50:54.000
There's actually going to be a Zork room because, basically, Adventure Con had started

50:54.000 --> 50:58.000
out as a 30th birthday celebration for Zork.

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
And so they decided to – it kind of grew into this all-encompassing adventure game

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
thing.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
I don't know how many times Andreo started about music games, but now we're all video

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
games because we did that.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
So there you go.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
That's kind of neat.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
And this, by the way, this is the first Adventure Con.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
So it started off being a Zork thing.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
Now it's this whole big thing because they're actually going to have Al Lowe from Sierra

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
there, Jane Jensen, the creator of the Gabriel Knights games.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
It's pretty rad.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
I did not realize that Zork 1 was written in 1977.

51:28.000 --> 51:34.000
The White House with the mailbox here seems so, so long ago.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Hey, Rob?

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
What?

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
I just unleashed a grue in your underwear.

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Thank you.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
It's squishy.

51:42.000 --> 51:49.000
Anyway, moving on for some different news.

51:49.000 --> 51:54.000
The games for Windows Live beta sign-up is now open.

51:54.000 --> 52:01.000
It's the Microsoft PC version of Xbox Live, and the two are going to be tied together

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
for cross-platform play.

52:03.000 --> 52:11.000
So go check it out if you are not blessed enough to console game with the rest of us

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
cool kids.

52:14.000 --> 52:20.000
And I will not be checking this out because I do not have Vista.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I do not want Vista.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
Nor do I want to play PC.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Do not want.

52:25.000 --> 52:30.000
But, what's kind of cool though, everyone remembers Wii-Cade.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Wait, I have to say this real fast.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
You know why I don't want Windows Vista?

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
Because I do not want my computer to look like those god-awful Heroes previews that

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
were brought to us by Windows Vista.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Oh, I pissed off.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
That turned me off to Windows Vista.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
I was like, what have you done to my Heroes?

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
Do not want.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
And it's simulated Vista.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Your offering has not pleased Kitty.

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
More.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.000
No more.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Do not want.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
So, Wii-Cade, Flashlight that has games made for the Wii browser.

53:05.000 --> 53:11.000
Well, they have just opened up a downloadable API that will allow developers of other Flash

53:11.000 --> 53:16.000
games to use the Wii Remote's buttons for actual gameplay.

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
Before, it used to be limited to kind of mouse games that use only the A button for clicking

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
and stuff like that.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
But now they've actually figured out how to use every single button on the Wii Remote,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
which is pretty fucking awesome.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
So, hopefully we'll see some pretty cool games come from this.

53:32.000 --> 53:37.000
And hopefully I will actually work on OLRWii.com at some point.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
Yeah, you had to do that because there was some website I saw that had all these popular

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
Wii game things listed or something.

53:43.000 --> 53:48.000
And I did not see OLRWii.com and I remembered, oh yeah, there's nothing on it.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Sorry.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
Crackdown.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
It's been a problem.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
By the way, going back to the last story, it was commented in our chat room,

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Loki does not have friends on Vista.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
Where's Black Wolf now, Loki?

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
Black Wolf even made that comment, so you got no friends now.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I don't have Vista.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Oh no.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
It's a joke.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Well, here's the thing though.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
Windows Live, you remember, is part of the Live Anywhere, so technically I have a lot

54:14.000 --> 54:23.000
more games for Windows Live than I do for actual the PS3 network.

54:23.000 --> 54:31.000
So, ha, I do have friends on there and I don't even have it.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
Something that you can't play with friends, although I think it would be fun if you could.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
It's a SimCity DS.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
Actually, I don't know much about this.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Perhaps maybe you can play with friends.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Oh, there is wireless data exchange in this game.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
You can't play with friends.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
SimCity DS.

54:46.000 --> 54:51.000
It has officially been announced that it will be coming to the US.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
Yay.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Other things that SimCity DS allows you to do.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
You can blow out fires by blowing on the DS's microphone.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
Doesn't that actually keep fires going?

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Ah, forget it.

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
You sign off proclamations using the stylus.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
That's fun.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
So, there you have it.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
That will be coming out in June, by the way.

55:10.000 --> 55:15.000
That's a nice little translation time between Japan and the US there.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
Because I believe this game just came out in Japan like last week.

55:18.000 --> 55:25.000
I have to admit I'm not as excited about this game because it's based off the SimCity 2000 engine.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
And I didn't like SimCity when it went 3D.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
It was too much for my feeble brain to handle.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Bring me my old school 2D SimCity.

55:33.000 --> 55:39.000
I actually have it on Virtual Console and I never play it because I get sucked into other games.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
Like World of Warcraft.

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
Well, you know, that's just because you're an addict, Rob.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
How about a different game?

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
How about Darwinia?

55:50.000 --> 55:57.000
Darwinia, as announced by Introversion, is going to be multiplayer in 2008.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Excuse me.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
It's set for release on its own.

56:02.000 --> 56:09.000
It's called Multi-Winia. We'll let you play cooperatively or competitively.

56:09.000 --> 56:15.000
The number of people on, they're not really sure how much they're going to be able to handle.

56:15.000 --> 56:24.000
But they're hoping that they're going to go really, really massive.

56:24.000 --> 56:29.000
I'm going to reserve judgment for actually seeing it.

56:29.000 --> 56:42.000
They're saying that there's a quote by John Nottenbelt saying that it will let you organize your Darwinians into ranks and create massive armies.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
So that would be kind of cool.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
I don't know. I'm still going to reserve judgment for actually seeing it.

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
Is that a free game? I can't remember. Was Darwinia a free one?

56:50.000 --> 56:54.000
I believe it was. I thought about playing it.

56:54.000 --> 57:01.000
The chat, I'm sure, knows because I believe some folks ought to know what's going on there.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
Let me see if anybody in chat can answer my question there.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Oh, they say no it wasn't.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
I think you could download a demo for free is what it was.

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
Hitstun says Darwinia had a demo but the game was $20.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I was going to see if it was something I wanted to check out.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
I'll check out the demo because I'm kind of curious.

57:18.000 --> 57:27.000
By the way, I'm very proud of Miklotov because he's been unlocking achievements in Crackdown for me while this show's been going on.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
So he got me this First Blood achievement, which I didn't have, and Bare Knuckle Brawler.

57:31.000 --> 57:35.000
Kill 150 gang members with your bare hands. Nice.

57:35.000 --> 57:40.000
So if you wondered how I was on Xbox Live during the show, it's actually Miklotov playing Crackdown right now.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Awesome.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
But I have more achievements than you do at Crackdown.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
Alrighty. Yeah, you have a shitload of achievements in Crackdown.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I have more achievements than you do in Universe.

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
Oh God, I can't believe I didn't mention this at the top of the show.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
That's alright. Nobody gets to the end of the show.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
Do you know who I got a message from on Xbox Live while I was playing DDR Universe?

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
No.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.000
Strip Club DJ. Do you know who that person is?

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
Yes.

58:05.000 --> 58:10.000
He is like the guy who was, for a long time, he was the number one gamer points holder on all of Xbox Live, right?

58:10.000 --> 58:13.000
He has over 100,000 gamer score.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
I got a message from him, and it said simply,

58:15.000 --> 58:19.000
Can you use the joystick on DDR?

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
Because I think he's probably contemplating, do I want to get DDR to get the 1,000 achievement points out of?

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
So I replied. I replied with a voice message though.

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
But I said something like, yes you can, but obviously you're supposed to use the dance pad,

58:31.000 --> 58:35.000
but if you're just trying to run through the game, you'll probably just want to use the controller.

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
But I said something about quest mode sucking, and a lot of the unlocks coming through that.

58:39.000 --> 58:46.000
Yeah, see I was stupid and I told somebody there was like 75 unlocks because in quest mode it says 0 of 75 for music stuff.

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
That's how much you own, or how many songs you own in quest mode, right?

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
That's what it is.

58:51.000 --> 58:56.000
When you buy a song in quest mode to have the advantage in quest mode, that's...

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
See, the game doesn't fucking explain any of this.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
That's why quest mode sucks.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.000
I didn't even know what the hell that meant.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
That's what it means.

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
So there you go.

59:06.000 --> 59:11.000
But that was kind of funny to get a message from him because I guess apparently at one point,

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
and I looked at my gamercard.net right after that because that's the one that ranks,

59:15.000 --> 59:20.000
I was apparently like number six or seven in the world for gamer score earned in DDR universe.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Really?

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
Yeah, because I ran through the game and played all the songs.

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
I got like 400 achievement points and then I just ran through a lot of the game real fast.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
I'm sure I'm not up there anymore when you look.

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
I gotta just play through it. I can probably get way up there.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I think it's getting harder and harder now.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
I doubt I'm even in the top 25 at this point.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Now you got me all curious. I'm gonna look.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
See, am I even up there now?

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Oh wow, I'm still number 17.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
Look at that. There I am.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.000
Does anyone have all of them?

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
Somebody has 900 points, 900 of the points, and somebody else has 860.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
But nobody has all 1,000 yet.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
I only have 480 points in the game.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
It's not that hard to...

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I mean, I could probably, if I really just sat down and played it,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I could probably crank out the whole game in one day.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I may think achievement points are fun and all,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
and they kind of add something to the game,

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
but I would not consider myself an achievement point whore, so to speak.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.000
So it was kind of just interesting that I did show up on there

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
and got contacted by Strip Club DJ.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
A true achievement points whore because of it, so interesting.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Anyhow, we're gonna open up the Skype line.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
If you want to give us a call and interact with our program, you can do so.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
The number is 1-877-GAME-OLR,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
or you can always use Skype to give us a call.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
If you want more information on that, you can visit www.orangeloungeradio.com

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
and click on Interact With Us,

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.000
and we'll wait for some calls to start coming in.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
While we wait for something to come in, does anybody have a last-minute story?

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Yep.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
What do you want, Jamie?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Well, Lucky had one first, right?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Just real quick.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Just one story for now, and then we'll get to some other calls.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Just real quick.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
In God of War 2, someone had gotten the game out before it's come out,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.000
and on the back of the manual, it says God of War PSP coming in 2007.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
So confirm it is coming on the PSP.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
All right, there you have it.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Now we can go to the phones.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Well, wait.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
We'll get more last-minute stories in a minute.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
No problem.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Hi, you're on Renaissance Radio.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Who's this?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Legend of Zaku.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Hi, Legend of Zaku.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I already know about, you know, that Gold test is going to be released tomorrow for the location test, right?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I think you said, because you're dropping out there on the stream a little bit,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
you said something about 2DX Gold coming out tomorrow for a location test.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Yeah, we mentioned that on last week's show.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Why?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000
No, I mean, they're all saying that, you know, from what I'm hearing right now is that,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
you know, it has to do really good in order for it to actually move any further.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
It's like a one-shot deal at the moment right now.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Well, but wait a minute, though.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I mean, what about those arcades that import Japanese games anyway,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
like Arcade Infinity and whatever that one is on the East Coast that was...

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:09.000
But it changes on that single location test happening tomorrow and for the next two weeks.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
So this is the one that might tip the scale.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Well, what city is it in again?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
It's somewhere in Illinois, right?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Naperville.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Naperville?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Yeah.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
In Illinois?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Yeah, it's near Betzen's locations nearby in Chicago.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
All right.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Well, if you are in the Chicago Naperville area and you are a music video game fan

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
and you want to see BeatMania make a U.S. debut in arcades, you've got to go.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You've got to help out.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
If you want to see it out, go through.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Come through on it.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
All right.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Well, thank you for the reminder, Mr. Zaku.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I unfortunately cannot attend.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Chicago's a little far.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
It's several thousand miles.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I know there's listeners probably in Illinois hearing this right now.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
That's very true.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
We do have the luxury of being not too far from L.A.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
where we can drive for six hours to play 2DX Gold whenever they get it.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
If they don't already have it, I don't even know.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
I haven't actually followed BeatMania in a while, sadly.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Right.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
All right.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Well, anything else, Zaku?

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Just Sony's rumbling about why they didn't bother to settle quickly with immersion

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
rather than just wait until they drop the PS3.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Pride.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Pride is more like they were banking on a sinking ship called their lawsuit.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Well, remember that Rumble is so last gen.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Well, they're spinning and they're in denial.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
It's like a little kid.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:40.000
They know they fucked up, and so they're just like they don't want to admit it.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
They don't want to admit they fucked up badly.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And that's why PS3 is not even worth getting right now, not even for another year.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
All right.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Well, Zaku, thank you very much for the call, and good luck with your 2DX Gold promotion.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
All right.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Thank you.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
All right.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Let's go to another phone call.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Hi.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Who's this?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Hey.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
What's up, guys?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
It's the Rob D.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Hi, Rob D. Are you still bitter about your loss from last week?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Not so much.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
All right.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I'm just giving you a hard time.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Lucky did a good job on that.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Very good sport about the whole thing.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Not too much.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Just wondering what you guys thought about the news about the 20-gigabyte PS3 being possibly

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
discontinued.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I don't know if you heard about that.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Kind of.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
We actually did cover it in part A. I don't know if Bobby's show ran long tonight or what.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000
No, I suck then.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000
It's okay.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
I've actually been busy recording some stuff, but that's a different story altogether.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
That's all right.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
We'll forgive you.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:39.000
You know, the 20-gig model, I mean, it was not something I was interested in anyway,

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
so I'm a little bit, you know, kind of about the whole thing anyway.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I think, to be honest, the 20-gig model is just as good as the 60-gig as far as what's

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
available for it.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I mean, if I were to buy one, I would pick the 20-gig.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I have a 20-gig, and it's great.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I mean, it's not like I have to worry about filling up with downloads because there's

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
nothing to download on it.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Well, isn't the 60-gigabyte version supposed to have dual HDMI ports?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Oh, wait.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
No, it doesn't.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
And then all models do have HDMI access.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
No, I'm kidding.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
That's what they said to E3.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
But, yeah.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Other than that, that's pretty much all I wanted to talk about.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
All right.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Well, thank you very much for the call, Rob D. We appreciate it.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Thank you for taking my call.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
See you guys later.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
No problem.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Have a good week.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Bye.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
All right.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Bye.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
All right.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
If you want to give a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR is the number you got to call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Dark Soccer, why don't you throw us your last-minute story while we're waiting for a call.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Well, it was actually something posted by Tigerclaw in the chat room during the break

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000
was Activision released a screenshot from the new Transformers game that they're putting

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
out.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Yeah, it makes my heart break.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I'm not going to like the movie.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I don't think.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
It doesn't look like Transformers.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.000
And the game makes my heart hurt.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
What's so bad about it?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
What isn't so bad about it?

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Oh, my God.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Did you see it?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
No.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
What does it look like?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It's fucking awesome is what it is.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
The fuck it is?

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
That does not look like Bumblebee.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
It looks like a bee's head and like junk.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I can't wait to see this movie.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
It's going to be awesome.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Look.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I know.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
It's awesome.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I mean, I'll go see it because I have to, but God, it's fucking ugly.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
All right.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Well, let's go to another call here on the Skype line and see what you folks have to

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
say.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Hi.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Who's this?

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Whoa.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Can you guys hear me?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Hi.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Yes.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
We can hear you.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
What's up?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Hey.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
This is DDR Dollar Bill.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Hi, DDR Dollar Bill.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
What's on your mind?

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Nothing much.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I got a Wii for Valentine's Day.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Oh, wheelie.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Yes, wheelie.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
It's a nice little present, too, I figured.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
What did you think?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Me and a girlfriend love it a lot.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:10.000
We play mostly Wii Sports and Wii Play, and we also ended up getting into Metal Slug Anthology.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:20.000
My big thing was that, did somebody in the show say that Metal Slug Anthology stunk?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
No.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
It's awesome.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
I haven't played Metal Gear Anthology.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I'm sorry.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Metal Slug Anthology.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.880
I think what we said on the show is that Kropotkin and Hendrix reviewed it this week.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:36.520
We were teasing the All Games thing because they play Kropotkin and Hendrix between our

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.080
show.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.760
I don't know if they said it sucked.

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.280
I unfortunately did not get a chance to hear their show yet this week.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.560
I don't think they did, though.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.560
I think they liked it.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.560
Yeah.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:50.280
It's pretty much better than the other emulations that came out for the other systems because

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:54.480
in most other emulated versions, like the Xbox, for example, there were loading times

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.360
in between each level.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.680
This one has none.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:03.080
It just pretty much goes into the game and plays it straight through, so it's exactly

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.560
like the arcade.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:08.560
Interesting.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:09.880
What else on the Wii have you been playing?

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.800
So obviously Metal Slug Anthology.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:18.920
I tried the Wii Sports and the Wii Play, and the Wii Play, it's alright.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.560
It was just worth it for the other controller, you know?

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.560
Gotcha.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.440
Yeah, but the Wii Sports is a blast.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:30.960
What do you think the Wii's chances are against the 360 and the PlayStation 3?

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960
You live...

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.160
Where was it that you live again?

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.760
New York, nearby where Rama lives.

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.000
What do you think, I thought for some reason you were in another country, what do you think

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.840
the chances are of the Wii doing against the 360 and the PS3 in the long run?

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:52.280
If they can get better games that just don't rely on the Wii controls, but rather makes

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.840
something like the original stuff and a good third party support, yeah, it's definitely

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:03.640
going to be allowed for a while, and not just thought of as a party system, you know?

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.660
Anything else you want to share with our listeners, my friend?

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:06.660
One question.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:07.660
Yes.

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:13.680
What was the exact difference with Zelda on the GameCube and the Wii?

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:18.760
Everything is right-handed on the Wii and left-handed on the GameCube.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.360
So they have the same graphics and music and all that?

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:23.360
Actually, no.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.640
The GameCube does not support the 16 by 9.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.640
Gotcha.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.080
Everything will be in the square as well, and that's why the graphics suffer a little

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.080
bit.

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.080
Oh, okay.

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.080
So, there you go.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.080
All right.

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.240
All right, well thank you so much for the call, buddy, and enjoy the Wii.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.960
Thanks, see you guys.

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:40.960
Later.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.960
All right, we'll try at least one more call here on the Skype line.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.040
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.680
It's deep breathing.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.680
Sorry.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.680
It's me.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:51.680
It's you.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.680
I thought it was an erotic phone call.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:53.680
Who's this?

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:54.680
This is Youni.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.680
Hi, Youni.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.840
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:59.560
I was wondering about something.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.040
I was thinking about getting a PS3, but you know how crappy they are?

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.080
What might be swaying your mind on this?

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:15.740
Well, I do play a lot of PS2 games on my PS2 and everything.

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:21.880
I don't know why I would want to buy one other than it enhances the graphics on your PS2

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:22.880
games.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:29.040
And even for a while, it was de-hancing them, if you might have seen anything a while back.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.320
It's like, why should you buy one?

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:38.680
Because they're like a 300 or 400, maybe 500 piece of crap, really.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:44.680
I'm just thinking about what I should buy, because I'm not really sure yet.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:48.760
I don't think the PlayStation 3 is worth it at the time.

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.800
Again, you've got to remember the golden rule of gaming here at Orange Launch Radio.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:57.600
A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.560
So it's really about what type of games you want to play.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:06.840
I mean, if first person shooters are your thing, oh my God, Xbox 360 all the way.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:11.920
If you want something that's a little more lighthearted, fun type of games, the Wii is

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:15.040
very your active system type of game.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.080
And then, of course, you've got the PlayStation 3, which doesn't have a lot right now.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.960
It's thought that a little later on down the line, it's strengths will be role playing

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.000
games and so on, just like it was on PlayStation 2.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.360
But right now, not a lot going for it.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.920
And you've got Microsoft trying to step it up with what they were lacking with the Xbox

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.840
the first time around.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:36.280
They're talking about bringing out another MMO from Square Enix called Final Fantasy

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.280
13.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.160
I'm not really sure about it.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.200
I mean, it might bring me back to Square Enix, but they're really sitting on their thumbs

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.460
most of the time when you're calling a GM on Final Fantasy 11.

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:55.080
I've been playing WoW, and when you call a GM, it's like that.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:58.640
You get the call, they answer it, they really care about their customers.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.840
Well, thank God Final Fantasy 13 is not online then.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.680
Yeah, I agree.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.280
I think WoW, to WoW's credit, they probably have a bigger budget because they have like

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.960
umpteen million subscribers.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:13.560
They probably have people on the clock 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.560
That's true.

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.920
But Final Fantasy 13 versus is not going to be online.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.160
I think it's going to be more of a Kingdom Hearts-ish game, but that sounds pretty hot

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160
to me.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.160
Yeah.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.440
Final Fantasy 13 probably will be the game that gets me on PlayStation.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:33.400
I also heard that Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories is coming to the PS2.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.600
I saw the trailer for it.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.240
There's a big trailer report on YouTube.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.840
It's completely redone, full style for the Kingdom Hearts games.

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.160
It's really, really awesome looking.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:49.860
If I can remember where to find it, I should see if I can't repost the YouTube link.

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:52.120
I'm very curious to check this out myself.

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:53.680
It is freaking awesome.

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.360
You should check it out.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360
It better be.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360
All right.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.800
Because if I'm rebuying Kingdom Hearts 2 for it, it better be.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.800
All right.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.760
Well, UNI, thanks so much for the call, and take care, and good luck on your system hunting.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.760
You too.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.760
Thank you.

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:07.760
Thank you.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.760
All right.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:09.760
Let's see if we get any more calls.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.760
Ring, ring, ring.

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.760
Oh.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.760
Well, that must be on the back line.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.760
Hi.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:14.760
Who's this?

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:15.760
This is Shane.

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:16.760
Oh, hi.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.760
Oh, hey.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.760
Shane's standing right in front of me.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.760
Hi, Shane.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:20.760
Hi.

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:21.760
AKA Miklatov.

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:22.760
That's what I am this week.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:23.760
We can't call you Miklatov anymore.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.840
Well, I had to change it because I'm trying to get into a pump group, and there was already

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.920
a Miklatov in pump, so I have to go by my more recent nickname of Arx.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.200
Well, whatever the hell your name is.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.200
That's why I just go by Shane.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.200
All right.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.200
Then what do you want?

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.200
Crackdown's the best game ever.

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.200
I love it.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.200
It's in my mind.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.200
Yeah.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.200
I saw you unlock some achievements for me.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.200
I appreciate that.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:41.200
Heck, yeah.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.200
It's so much fun kicking them.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.200
What?

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.200
I wasn't really getting into it.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.200
What really do you love about this game?

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:50.840
You can jump really high, and you jump across rooftops, and you're like the Tick, that superhero.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.400
Was it just because I hadn't leveled up enough that I couldn't do it?

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.400
No.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.080
I think you just didn't understand what you were doing, and...

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.080
You're right.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.080
I didn't.

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:03.200
You're supposed to go and shoot people and kick them and jump from roof to roof, and

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.560
it's so much fun, and I really want it.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.560
All right.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.440
Well, you can't have my copy because now that you've told me it's fun, I need to go back

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.440
and play it more.

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.440
It's a terrible game.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.440
Lies.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.440
Yeah.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.440
Lies.

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.440
You played Myst Online a little bit.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.440
What'd you think of that?

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:22.400
I think I would like it a whole lot if it didn't have the worst controls I've ever touched.

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.400
It's really terrible.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.040
But it's simple.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.400
Simply hard.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:37.120
Maybe if it had a game pad input thing I could use, but I can't use W-A-S-D, and it goes

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.640
back to that old Resident Evil style where up is always forward no matter which way you're

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.720
facing, and I don't dig that, and the mouse is awkward to use.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:50.240
But I think I will probably give it another shot because it was really cool because I

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.840
like solving puzzle things.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.320
All right.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:56.680
And Crackdown is a great game.

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:57.680
It's so much fun.

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:00.840
I would say something more, but it's probably racist.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.160
It is so funny.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.560
Can I say it anyway?

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.560
I guess.

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:12.880
It's so much fun kicking the Mexicans in the head.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:15.360
Orange Lounge Radio has just been banned from Mexico.

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.360
Look at that.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.360
How do you like that?

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.520
That's the only part I'm at right now.

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:22.840
I'm sure once I beat that part I can go kick some other race, but Mexicans are so easy

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.840
to target.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.840
All right.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:25.840
There you go.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.840
Click.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:29.560
DDR dollar bill says holy racist remark.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.560
My God.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.560
Act Deafed.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.560
Act Deafed is a Mexican.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.560
Didn't like that comment.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.520
Did not like that comment.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:41.840
That's okay because I'm like a quarter Brazilian and that's all I know, so I'm dirty too.

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:49.880
You can send those cards and letters to Shane or Miklata or whatever the fuck your name

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.800
is this week at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:00.320
Act Deafed says I'm a Mexican, but I agree with Miklata, so there you go.

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.320
The violence.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.320
The violence.

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.960
I do not appreciate the violence.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.160
Our phone lines are ringing off the hook and everyone's trying to get in.

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.160
All right.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.160
One more call.

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.160
Hi.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.160
Who's this?

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.160
Hi.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.160
This is Agent Otto.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.160
Agent Otto.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.040
I don't recognize your name.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.040
What do you want, Agent Otto?

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.240
Are you a new listener?

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.200
Are you a new listener of Orange Lounge Radio?

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:23.600
I'm from Elevator Action.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.600
Oh.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.600
Oh, God.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.600
Oh, yes.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.200
Elevator Action, that horribly overrated game from the 1980s.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.600
How are you, Agent Otto?

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:32.600
I'm doing great.

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.000
I don't know what your problem is with my game and what I do for a living.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.600
I go into buildings, find documents, and not get shot in the head and not get crushed by

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:41.600
elevators.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.600
Well, what do you do?

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.360
You sit there and talk about how bad my game is?

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.860
Well, Agent Otto, your game bored the shit out of me because it was pretty much the same

01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:51.880
joke after the first two minutes for hours on end.

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.720
You know the game's actually hard, right?

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.720
Yes, it is pretty hard.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.760
That's another reason why I don't play it.

01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.760
Oh.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:03.440
Well, then you probably didn't play anything from the 80s then because you clearly hate

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.440
hard games.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.800
No, I actually played a lot of games from the 80s, like Crystal Castles.

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.500
Actually, I don't know if you listened to the program last week, but we had a whole

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:13.600
segment on 80s games that I'd played and beat the host.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.840
I don't listen to your show.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:16.840
I'm too busy going to...

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.560
How do you get the number to this program then, Agent Otto?

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:25.080
Because I'm at DMN's house drinking beer, and I heard you talking shit about me.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:26.320
Why are you hanging out with DMN?

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.000
He sucks.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.680
Because I have no one better to hang out with.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:30.680
I see.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.200
So, Agent Otto is DMN's only friend, just like Black Wolf is Loki's only friend.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.280
Yeah, I know.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.480
He's a pretty sad guy.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:44.640
Well, then, much like I do to DMN, Agent Otto, I'm hanging up on you now.

01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:52.360
Going to the chat room, let's see.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:55.240
Sky Warrior says DMN is not funny.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.520
Alpha Catagram says DMN sucks.

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:04.760
You can hear DMN here on Orange Lounge Radio on Thursday nights on STFU, if you want to

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.760
hear that.

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:06.760
Uni says DMN is not funny.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.760
Aw, poor DMN.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.760
Poor baby.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.960
Alright, sorry to those folks we didn't get to, but we got to get the show wrapped up

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.560
because it's already like 20 minutes after 9, we're running a little long tonight, and

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.320
we'd like to go home at a decent hour tonight.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:25.120
So if there's any more last minute stories, now's a good time to get them out?

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.120
Nope.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.120
Loki?

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.120
Nope.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.680
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.240
Loki, your final thought?

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.760
I need to finish Crackdown.

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.280
Dark Soccer, your final thought?

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.600
I need to play more Captain America.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:45.680
My final thought is Pants!

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.560
Thank you so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting and independent gaming

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:50.560
radio.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.880
If you want to show your appreciation for Orange Lounge Radio and us doing this crap

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:58.880
for free, you can tell two people about Orange Lounge Radio, because if everybody tells two

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:03.000
people about Orange Lounge Radio, within weeks we will have taken over the world.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.760
So thank you very much, and if you have no friends to tell about Orange Lounge Radio,

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:14.080
you can always leave us a nice review on iTunes or Digg or Podcast Alley or one of those sites.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.600
That will work as well.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:18.480
All right, so that's going to do it for the show.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.040
We'll see you here next week with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:24.040
