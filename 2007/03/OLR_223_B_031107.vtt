00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, March 11, 2007 to be exact.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
You might be thinking to yourself, if you're listening to this on your iPod or your Zune or whatever it is, your Zen that you have right now,

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
you might be thinking, or your PSP, you might be thinking, wait a minute, it's way past March 11, what are you talking about?

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Well, we record live on Sunday nights and then split up our show into two segments,

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
because we talk a lot here at Orange Lounge Radio and a lot about games, of course.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
And we split it up into two segments and offer it on the podcast stream on Mondays and Wednesdays for you to listen to throughout the week.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
And if you guys are ready, Dark Soccer and Loki, my lovely co-host in crime, we'll get back to the gaming news.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Okay.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
And we'll start it off with, that was a nice hearty okay there.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Okay.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
We'll start it off with the Nintendo keynote from Gay Developers Conference,

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
because we talked a lot in part eight about the Sony keynote and how Sony's winning a lot of people back over thanks to their announcements about home.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Well, what about Nintendo?

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
Well, Nintendo basically made only two unveilings in their conference at GDC,

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
and that was a new Mario Galaxy trailer and the fact that it would be out this year,

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
and a type of, I don't know what you'd want to call it, Mii Idol or something like that,

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
basically a do you like this Mii, it's like a Mii popularity channel has been announced for the Nintendo Wii.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Not a lot of announcements outside of that, but then again, a lot of people are saying,

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
ah Nintendo you guys suck, Sony made all these announcements and Nintendo you didn't do crap.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Well, keep in mind folks, it was Game Developers Conference.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
What did Miyamoto talk about?

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
He talked about the WIFO meter, he talked about how Mario 128 kind of evolved into the game Peekman,

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
he talked about game development types of things.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
On that end, Nintendo really didn't disappoint I don't think.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
But, you know, if you were there looking for the E3 Bang and Fireworks press conference,

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
I guess you were going to be a little disappointed.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000
But of course we remember that story last week that said, hey Nintendo's got some stock things going on,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
they're not going to be able to make any big announcements to GDC whether they want to or not.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
So there you have it.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
So unfortunately the only little trinkets you got there from Nintendo were those two things.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
But curious, what do you guys think about that?

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Do either of you guys watch the new Galaxy trailer? What did you think of it?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
That was okay, it just looked like Galaxy though.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
I mean it wasn't anything different that I've seen.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
The graphics were pretty rad.

02:37.000 --> 02:47.000
I got to say I'm more excited about Super Paper Mario though after seeing some more footage of that than I am the Mario Galaxy.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Because it looks like you can flip 2D to 3D at the touch of a button.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Like if you're playing the 2D thing and you see a wheel thing.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
There was one video I saw a wheel, a spiked wheel was coming at you.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
You hit a button to go to 3D and then you can run around the wheel.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
And then you go back to the 2D mode. It's so crazy.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I liked it. It was very cool.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
So that was something I'm looking forward to way more than any of the other stuff that was talked about unfortunately.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Smash Brothers!

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I'll give Mario Galaxy a try of course.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I want my Smash Brothers.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
We'll see.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
Again, if you want to give your comments in chat, it's chat.orangeloungelounge.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
That's the second I've ever done this show.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
I'm out of it tonight. Something's wrong.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
There's something in the water I'm drinking tonight.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
chat.orangeloungeloungeradio.com

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
actdef says Super Paper Mario for the win.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
BlackWolf was at Game Developers Conference and played Super Paper Mario.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
He says Super Paper Mario equals fun.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
The A button goes to 3D.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Joshi says Super Paper Mario is when I get a Wii.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
So it looks like a lot of folks are very excited.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
ssj100matt says yay more channels but how about Galaxy, Smash, and Metroid?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
There's your comments from chat.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
This week we saw some pretty good stuff coming to the Virtual Console,

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
including Super Ghouls and Ghosts.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
That was, of course, very fucking hard as usual.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
And of course, Sword of Vermillion.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
And Elevator Action for the role that was on the NES.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
And this week though, what are we going to be getting?

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Well, from what I've been hearing, I think Sonic Spinball was among those.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
I know it was on the Japan launch there, at least what they're getting this week.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
And if I remember correctly, they also were getting Excite Bike

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
and Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Sweet! Oh my god, I love Legend of the Mystical Ninja.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Serious? No, I'm like being serious.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I totally love that game on Super Nintendo.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
And Turbografx-16 Fire Pro Wrestling combination tag.

04:47.000 --> 04:54.000
But I know Spinball was confirmed coming out this week on the Virtual Console for Japan.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I can't remember about the US though.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
Wasn't Tecmo Bowl discovered somehow, whether it be the ESRB thing or looking at the website thing?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I think it was on the website, yeah.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
That's still not officially out, so maybe that is on its way.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I think they saw Spinball there too, if I remember correctly.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Interesting.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
I can't remember.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
But you know, you're going to expect some about three games tomorrow.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Or Monday.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Anything on Virtual Console that you were dying for still not out?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
I mean, I got Kid Icarus, so I kind of got my wish.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
I have R-Type.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I know, but anything not out that you still want.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
I mean, obviously Guardian Legend, but realistically, something from either Nintendo itself or one of their very close third-party developers.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Snow Brothers.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Snow Brothers. That's an interesting choice.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
I remember that game, actually.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
I would like to see, and I know Jamie hates this one, but I really like Strider on the NES.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I didn't say I hated it.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
Actually, the game was based off of the Strider manga.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Oh, okay.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
But you told me once you hated it because the arcade one is so much better.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
I didn't say I hated it.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
I just said the arcade one is so much better.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Wouldn't it be neat, though, one week to get Strider on NES and Strider on Genesis?

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
That would be kind of cool, wouldn't it?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Mega Man would be my other wish.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Yeah, they need some Mega Man games on there would be pretty cool.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
Actually, Capcom just needs some more stuff on there.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I would think it would be pretty cool.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
You know, I was a fan of this game, at least.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Uniracers.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
I don't know.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
No one really played that game from Nintendo.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
We've got a minute chat room here.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Of course, you know, you bring up Virtual Console.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Everyone makes their list of demands.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
James Patrick says, Secret of Mana and Evermore.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Morrie says, Earthbound, please.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Ryoma says, Ice Climbers.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Actually, Ice Climbers is already up.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Go check it out.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Unless he was referring to something else, but I think that's the list.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Salamander.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
A life force in this country, but that would be cool.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
ActDef says, Kirby Superstar.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
There you go.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
Mel B on our staff says, Tecmo Bowl, but will it be licensed?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Not likely.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Just leave it in there with the old, like, 88 lineup or whatever that game had in it.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
That would be funny.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Wouldn't it?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Mm-hmm.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Mm-hmm.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Then you could still play the 40.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
You could play as the 49ers and actually be good because it's 1988.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
That was a sports joke.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I don't make those very often.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
It was a sports joke for you guys out there.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
Well, for those who are disgusted with Rob's, you know, sports jokes, no, not really.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
This has absolutely nothing to do with sports.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
We have Chocobo Tales coming out in May in the UK.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
That is, it's coming out April 3rd here in the U.S.

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
But you play as a Chocobo and you have to, you know, stop the bad guy from, you know,

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
I guess being all evil even though he's all evil.

07:38.000 --> 07:47.000
So, you go around and you do mini games and you build up a deck in card battles and save

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
the universe on your DS through the Wi-Fi.

07:50.000 --> 07:58.000
So, it's saying that it's going to be, like I said, released in May in the UK and April

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
3rd in the U.S. but it's already out in Japan.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I'd really like to know if anyone's already played it because I'm sort of thinking about

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
it.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
All right.

08:04.000 --> 08:11.000
In an unannounced feature, it will actually enhance your DS to smell like Chocobo, actually.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
Kentucky Ferraga Chocobo.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
No, but remember in, like, one of the Final Fantasy, I think it was Final Fantasy II U.S.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
for Japan, you would have to use the big carrot when it came up on the screen that said, it

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
smells like Chocobo and you kind of always wondered, what the hell does a Chocobo smell

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
like?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Does it smell like farts or roses or what?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Smells like chicken shit.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Kentucky Fried Chicken?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
What?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Smells like Kentucky Ferraga Chocobo.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Sorry.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
Well, okay, maybe I'm full of shit on that DS feature but this is something I'm not kidding

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
you about.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
The Opera DS browser is coming to North America on June 4th.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Unfortunately, you can't use Flash, you can't use video, you can't use sound, and you can't

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
use PDF.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
But you can use the stylus and what's kind of cool is that you can have some handwriting

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
recognition there.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
The browser will be retailing for about $32 in Japan, $52 in Europe, no price announced

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
here yet but I guess based off those prices you could speculate $34 or $39.99, right?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
That would be a fair statement.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
I guess something to compete with the PSP a little bit although this is not included

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
with the DS.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
It's kind of something extra.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
But if you've ever wanted to surf the internet while on the go on your DS, there you have

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
it.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
I would not buy that.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm not feeling this.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I'm really not.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
You know what would have been cool is if I had the internet channel on my Wii then I

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
could beam it over to my DS.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
Where's that?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Whatever happened to that functionality?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Wasn't that something they said you could do at one point?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Is that the DS would interface with the Wii?

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
Well, they're going to have that with some future games but they may add that later.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I have a feeling that's something up their sleeve.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
DS demos on your Wii a little later on.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Why not?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I don't know.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
But one thing I was going to say is I think that they've done this probably better at

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
home brew.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.560
I mean, really the only problem and the reason why they don't have a lot of the flash support

10:04.560 --> 10:08.640
and stuff is because there's not enough RAM in the system and there's no storage.

10:08.640 --> 10:13.120
It's just pretty much the cart itself which doesn't hold that much.

10:13.120 --> 10:19.480
You would probably need to have some sort of Game Boy Advance thing plugged in the bottom.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.760
In fact, I think that's what they did in Japan.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.360
A couple different versions of that.

10:23.360 --> 10:28.760
Joshie16 wants to know is there going to be an OLR DS page since we have the PSP page

10:28.760 --> 10:30.280
and a Wii one in the works.

10:30.280 --> 10:31.280
Probably not.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.280
I can't imagine that either.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.480
I don't think that many people are going to be using that.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.800
Maybe like five people would use it if even that.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.080
Do we even have five listeners of Orange Launch Radio?

10:39.080 --> 10:44.320
I don't think we do actually so I don't think there'd be a lot of points to do that.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.800
Five listeners of Orange Launch Radio?

10:45.800 --> 10:46.800
Yeah.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.420
I think we have more than that.

10:49.420 --> 10:50.420
Maybe a handful.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.420
I don't know.

10:51.420 --> 10:56.220
The first episode we only had five listeners but my how we've grown since then.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.480
Thank you guys so much for supporting us over the years.

10:58.480 --> 11:01.200
Our fifth anniversary is coming up in just two months.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.300
Two months at the station but I think we're actually going to celebrate it with the first

11:04.300 --> 11:10.160
live show which was June 23, 2002.

11:10.160 --> 11:16.080
Last week we talked about how the Wii didn't have Wii support for third parties.

11:16.080 --> 11:21.920
This week SNK's president says that they're not letting third parties have online capabilities

11:21.920 --> 11:24.440
either.

11:24.440 --> 11:30.220
Which is funny because Sega's got a Pachinko game coming out that does have online and

11:30.220 --> 11:36.640
does have Wii support so I basically ask are they just not letting SNK have online support

11:36.640 --> 11:41.560
or Wii support because to be honest I mean and I'm sure everyone can agree with me there

11:41.560 --> 11:46.820
haven't really been any new SNK games coming out other than these collections or ports

11:46.820 --> 11:54.160
of older games so I don't know maybe you should make something new for a change and from what

11:54.160 --> 11:57.160
I hear I guess their next game is an art of fighting you know collection.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.160
I can remember that got brought up on last week's show yeah.

12:00.160 --> 12:01.160
Yay.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.160
All right.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.160
I can't wait for that.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.800
I'm sure it's going to be uber awesome.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.760
Totally retro hurrah.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.840
Make something new.

12:11.840 --> 12:19.240
All right well let's go on to another topic shall we?

12:19.240 --> 12:23.360
Well this is something that we've been of course talking about since the announcement

12:23.360 --> 12:32.280
of having our E3 taken from us but there is going to be E3 this year if you were invited

12:32.280 --> 12:38.520
it's July 11th through 13th to quote the invite it says the opportunity to engage in one on

12:38.520 --> 12:43.920
one meetings with leading game company executives in an intimate setting as well as network

12:43.920 --> 12:48.680
socialized and test pilot major company offerings.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.000
Well I got invited.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Congratulations.

12:52.000 --> 13:00.280
So if it works out for me I'm going to go but I'm actually I sort of do see more now

13:00.280 --> 13:04.080
of the logic in them changing it to a more of a meeting based I think we're still going

13:04.080 --> 13:08.480
to have the demos and such it's just not going to be the big over the top production that

13:08.480 --> 13:10.500
you know E3 was in the past.

13:10.500 --> 13:14.120
And not really many people have figured out why you know people are getting invited.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.600
I was actually looking just earlier today Joystiq ran an interesting story on the whole

13:17.600 --> 13:22.560
thing and apparently they're saying they said here in the story this week that some journalists

13:22.560 --> 13:27.920
received their invites but many did not and interesting enough Jamie did get an invite

13:27.920 --> 13:31.880
but and so did someone else on our staff who works behind the scenes.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.800
But Loki and I have not.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.400
So where's the love you guys?

13:36.400 --> 13:40.880
I know there's some developers out there listen to us sniff sniff cry cry send us an email

13:40.880 --> 13:44.800
we want to go we'll interview you have you on the show we'll play beat the host with

13:44.800 --> 13:47.800
you we'll bring our rig.

13:47.800 --> 13:53.000
No but I do hope you know I had a lot of fun at the E3 shows and not just you know the

13:53.000 --> 13:56.120
over the top stuff but actually just getting to play the games and reporting on it so I

13:56.120 --> 13:58.680
hope from that perspective we get to go.

13:58.680 --> 14:02.080
But if not then we'll just rely on Jamie she'll be a one woman show.

14:02.080 --> 14:06.600
No offense you know I'm from the room where we kind of speculated yesterday or how people

14:06.600 --> 14:07.600
got invited.

14:07.600 --> 14:13.160
It's basically if you've had meetings with people you probably got invited type thing.

14:13.160 --> 14:17.080
I don't know it's just like a lot of times like we didn't go to I mean we went to meetings

14:17.080 --> 14:21.800
for some things but I got a lot of accomplishments booth tours and stuff like that and actually

14:21.800 --> 14:26.640
meeting people face to face instead of just you know actually having meetings and stuff.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.920
Rob went to meetings with me.

14:27.920 --> 14:32.040
Yeah it's at this point it's really all speculation we just don't know how they're picking it.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.280
It might also have to do with how you registered.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.400
Who knows?

14:35.400 --> 14:36.400
I pre-registered.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.680
Yeah so that was my request.

14:38.680 --> 14:44.280
Some of the meetings that I went to were ones that required you to scan your card.

14:44.280 --> 14:48.520
I don't know we'll see we can speculate till we're blue in the face but E3 is still a few

14:48.520 --> 14:51.040
months away we shall see what happens.

14:51.040 --> 14:55.400
We'll let you know the minute we hear if we're going or not we'll let you know.

14:55.400 --> 15:01.000
Well shifting gears completely here going from E3 to talk about politics a little bit.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.740
Game politics ran a story earlier this week about the video games made me do it defense.

15:07.740 --> 15:13.960
Well apparently what happened is that this 19 year old Patrick Morris actually shot his

15:13.960 --> 15:19.880
15 year old boy with a shotgun and used the good old excuse the video games made me do

15:19.880 --> 15:24.720
it and his mom even you know tried to go in there and say he would just go into his room

15:24.720 --> 15:26.920
and play those video games.

15:26.920 --> 15:31.640
Well the prosecution brought out Dr. Michael Knapp from Ashland Oregon and he said it was

15:31.640 --> 15:34.120
ridiculous to blame video games.

15:34.120 --> 15:38.160
Moreover he said while you usually can't predict violent behavior other risk factors in Morris'

15:38.160 --> 15:43.680
life such as his drug use and emotional disorders were much stronger factors.

15:43.680 --> 15:49.240
So after 30 minutes of deliberations he she sentenced the judge sentenced Morris to life

15:49.240 --> 15:50.240
in prison.

15:50.240 --> 15:54.200
The video games made me do it defense carried no weight.

15:54.200 --> 15:58.320
Because well it should have not had any weight because that's a stupid defense.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.080
Because it's the hip hop music that did it.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.320
No one made you press the power button asshole.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.080
It was a hip hop music game that made me do it.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.920
It's all Def Jam icons.

16:06.920 --> 16:10.840
Def Jam icon absolutely.

16:10.840 --> 16:11.840
But anyways.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.600
Actually if anything makes me want to go out and get a shotgun and shoot people it would

16:15.600 --> 16:18.040
probably be Sonic on the Playstation 3.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.120
I don't know about you.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.560
Please don't take me literally.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.360
I hope you guys know I'm joking.

16:24.360 --> 16:31.200
Well sometimes we talk about you know harming the certain beta testers of online functions

16:31.200 --> 16:35.000
in say portable Grand Theft Auto games.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.480
Because you fucking sucked at it.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.360
But anyways.

16:40.360 --> 16:44.440
One thing though that's going to make people you know especially Sega make some more games

16:44.440 --> 16:50.440
is this online poll that they have where they're trying to figure out the interests of older

16:50.440 --> 16:56.760
franchises what people want remakes of and so far Nite seems to be winning out.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.200
Which is pretty awesome.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.760
That was the funniest thing I think I've ever seen.

17:00.760 --> 17:05.680
I looked up and randomly Nelly was poking Loki in the head.

17:05.680 --> 17:06.920
Yes.

17:06.920 --> 17:11.840
Anyway that was really good radio.

17:11.840 --> 17:15.080
So Nite would you like to see Nite's come back?

17:15.080 --> 17:16.080
Oh hell yeah.

17:16.080 --> 17:17.080
Nite's would be awesome.

17:17.080 --> 17:22.640
And you know I think it would be really good though to move on to something else that doesn't

17:22.640 --> 17:24.960
have to do with video game news.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.520
Really what would that be?

17:26.520 --> 17:27.520
That would be the mailbag.

17:27.520 --> 17:31.240
Ah but don't our emailers sometimes email us with video game related things?

17:31.240 --> 17:32.240
I would hope so.

17:32.240 --> 17:33.240
Sometimes but I ignore it.

17:33.240 --> 17:36.680
Alright well let's open up the old mailbag and see what's in store.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.320
If you want to email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

17:39.320 --> 17:49.800
Um today's first email actually comes from Grin without a cat.

17:49.800 --> 17:54.720
Hi um hey guys I've dug up some sales figures for PS2 hardware after listening to you trying

17:54.720 --> 17:56.800
to figure out why Sony hates Europe.

17:56.800 --> 18:01.200
I don't think it's sales figures at the moment there's been 25 million PS2 sold in Japan

18:01.200 --> 18:04.880
47 million in North America and 45 million sold in Europe.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.120
The slimline model is actually sold better in Europe than anywhere else with 18 million

18:08.120 --> 18:11.520
against North America 16 million and Japan 6 million.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.760
Europe also seems to be the one who takes some interest in their casual and innovative

18:14.760 --> 18:17.400
games such as Itoy, Singstar and Buzz.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.080
A quiz game with buzzer peripherals.

18:19.080 --> 18:22.680
They've all been big big sellers and done really well with non gamers.

18:22.680 --> 18:25.720
And it's not like Europe is short of PS3 game developers either.

18:25.720 --> 18:29.120
Titles coming out of Europe include Burnout Wipeout, Grand Theft Auto, Heavenly Sword

18:29.120 --> 18:33.840
Killzone Motorstorm, Little Big Planet, Singstar and The Darkness.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.180
It's kind of ironic in a way.

18:35.180 --> 18:40.000
Before Sony came along it was Nintendo that screwed Europe with games being released here

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
years later and price is way higher than we pay now.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.920
Some games didn't even show up at all but first two generations and it was actually

18:46.920 --> 18:51.120
seen as something of a savior to the European market of the now it appears Microsoft has

18:51.120 --> 18:55.400
taken that role as Nintendo is still screwing us on game releases so after all that we still

18:55.400 --> 19:00.960
don't know why Sony hates Europe love you grin without a cat.

19:00.960 --> 19:06.560
I don't know it seems like every week we're getting some type of email from a European

19:06.560 --> 19:10.720
listener and understandably so don't get me wrong but a European listener who is a little

19:10.720 --> 19:15.040
bit upset because they're constantly getting screwed by the game companies so unfortunately

19:15.040 --> 19:19.000
I don't have an easy answer for you on that one but thank you for the insight we do appreciate

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
that.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.440
I thought that I was actually very well thought out email so thank you for sending it.

19:25.440 --> 19:29.960
Next one comes up is from Bear Who Drive Car please make Sky stop attempting accents especially

19:29.960 --> 19:35.840
British that is all well I don't know what you're talking about Rob that your accent

19:35.840 --> 19:36.840
really is.

19:36.840 --> 19:37.840
Carry on.

19:37.840 --> 19:38.840
Would you like to go out and have some tea?

19:38.840 --> 19:42.960
It's really awful Bear Who Drive Car would you like to go out and have some tea a spot

19:42.960 --> 19:48.240
of tea or are you going to continue to be a tit?

19:48.240 --> 19:56.520
Next up comes from Sy this is dear olr hi grin anyhow on my world warcraft server cough

19:56.520 --> 20:02.440
Duran cough I guess there's a guild called less qq more pew pew just thought it was funny

20:02.440 --> 20:05.400
love this show you guys rock stuff like that.

20:05.400 --> 20:10.200
The olr guild is on Ravencrest by the way if you want more information go to the forums

20:10.200 --> 20:14.160
although that is a great name for a guild less qq more pew pew I should look that up

20:14.160 --> 20:18.000
on the armory.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.020
So how about this this one comes from Ali so I thought I would voice a few opinions

20:24.020 --> 20:27.960
on your cynicism toward the ps3 my brother had the opportunity to play a ps3 a couple

20:27.960 --> 20:31.320
of days ago and he told me it was really a lot of fun I believe he played resistance

20:31.320 --> 20:35.900
fall of man in gran turismo hd now granted my brother is pretty hardcore gamer he pulled

20:35.900 --> 20:40.720
strings to get himself an xbox 360 at launch got a ps2 at launch etc now I thought I would

20:40.720 --> 20:44.440
remind you of the ps2 launch everyone told us we were crazy for spending that much time

20:44.440 --> 20:49.920
that much on the game system and the dreamcast was so much better I also remember reading

20:49.920 --> 20:54.640
that the emotion engine was nigh impossible to program for however once time passed the

20:54.640 --> 20:59.520
ps2 gained traction price wise the price stayed even as flint inflation went on and people

20:59.520 --> 21:05.360
cracked how to get the most out of their ee now look at the ps3 everyone says the 360

21:05.360 --> 21:09.400
is 100 times better that the cell is near impossible to program for and that it was

21:09.400 --> 21:12.800
too expensive I think that will happen in a year or two the ps2 will see revival and

21:12.800 --> 21:17.720
will take the market other than that I literally got my 360 a half hour ago and I got cracked

21:17.720 --> 21:21.320
down call of duty 3 gears of war saints row and test drive unlimited the reason I'm telling

21:21.320 --> 21:26.080
you this is that I want some good um some music games I heard that ddr for 360 wasn't

21:26.080 --> 21:31.040
too good and as far as I can tell guitar hero 2 is not on xbox 360 will guitar hero come

21:31.040 --> 21:36.520
out for the xbox 360 and is ddr any good on 360 um yeah it is coming out on 360 I believe

21:36.520 --> 21:40.460
April is the big month for guitar hero 2 I like this insert usual love the show dribble

21:40.460 --> 21:45.560
here thank you uh boom boom rocket I don't know much about but people that have gotten

21:45.560 --> 21:48.560
their hands on it say if you like music games you're gonna like yourself some boom boom

21:48.560 --> 21:52.760
rocket uh there's that I don't know when that'll be out though knowing uh the release schedule

21:52.760 --> 21:57.600
it could be summer it could be the end of the year um ddr on the 360 is actually it's

21:57.600 --> 22:03.780
a it's not that bad it's just components of it are bad um but the game itself the main

22:03.780 --> 22:08.320
core element of the game I mean what's ddr it's songs and steps the songs are great and

22:08.320 --> 22:12.600
the steps are great so that's it it's it's a fine game it's just all the other stuff

22:12.600 --> 22:17.600
around it like quest mode sucks and some of the other stuff is not so hot but uh the game

22:17.600 --> 22:22.640
itself is fine um it depends how much do you love ddr I mean you're willing to spend 80

22:22.640 --> 22:26.760
bucks on it that's the question but it's some good songs and they'll keep you in shape and

22:26.760 --> 22:37.160
all that good stuff and our last email of the uh day is uh from uh azhp hey guys just

22:37.160 --> 22:42.960
had a comment possibly a very long comment on what did I miss him oh sorry lanky style

22:42.960 --> 22:47.800
was here and leaving and I was trying to kiss him on his bald head okay um on the email

22:47.800 --> 22:51.480
you guys got last week on the topic of piracy affecting game development first of all I'd

22:51.480 --> 22:55.280
like to say that the fact that nintendo puts out arguably higher quality games than sony

22:55.280 --> 22:59.560
and microsoft is that they simply care more about the fun factor in the games than any

22:59.560 --> 23:05.720
other developer out there uh shigeru miyamoto said in his gdc keynote that if at any point

23:05.720 --> 23:09.240
during the development he feels they have lost sight of the fact that this game is supposed

23:09.240 --> 23:14.960
to make people happy he scraps it and redoes it from the ground up that's devotion secondly

23:14.960 --> 23:18.520
the reason we are seeing more and more rehash equals is not because the developers do not

23:18.520 --> 23:23.360
have the resource to make entirely new franchises or because piracy is affecting them in an

23:23.360 --> 23:29.160
adverse fashion it is because the higher ups at companies decide they tell their developers

23:29.160 --> 23:33.440
make this the same game as last year and put a new title on it so you can generate large

23:33.440 --> 23:37.980
revenues this is purely marketing and financial based decision and is probably not affected

23:37.980 --> 23:42.520
at all by the piracy issue nintendo is not like other companies in this regard they spend

23:42.520 --> 23:46.080
as much time as they want or need pushing it back pushing back release dates if necessary

23:46.080 --> 23:51.720
to ensure the highest quality games not the highest quantity lastly nintendo's consoles

23:51.720 --> 23:56.400
are not much harder to pirate are not any harder to pirate games on than the xbox uh

23:56.400 --> 24:00.600
than the ps2 or xbox i have a mod chip in my gamecube and i burn my original discs to

24:00.600 --> 24:05.720
many dvdrs so that i don't have to lug around giant dvd cases that gamecube games come in

24:05.720 --> 24:11.360
as i travel a lot there are also mods that allow you to use full-size dvds for your games

24:11.360 --> 24:15.960
so the argument that nintendo games are harder to pirate as a reason that nintendo is succeeding

24:15.960 --> 24:20.440
is not valid i honestly don't think that any company looks at pirating as a major reason

24:20.440 --> 24:24.120
what their games are not selling as well because most people who pirate games wouldn't buy

24:24.120 --> 24:28.200
the games they did not have the opportunity to pirate them so the ratio of pirates to

24:28.200 --> 24:33.040
mass consumers is really low and mostly for people with the technical know-how anyway

24:33.040 --> 24:36.320
that's just my two cents i hope this sparks some discussion between all of you as i wanted

24:36.320 --> 24:40.160
to show the corporate side of gaming as another reason why games are not as high quality as

24:40.160 --> 24:46.520
they used to be hey freaking men i i would agree that piracy is something really that

24:46.520 --> 24:53.120
not the masses really gets in on i mean um very few people would know how to put ddr

24:53.120 --> 24:58.320
fifth mix on a psp loki uh or would know how to you know do some of that stuff you know

24:58.320 --> 25:02.400
they would know how to pirate or mod a gamecube and all that stuff it's not an easy thing

25:02.400 --> 25:06.220
to do your average person is not going to be able to do it i kind of think about when

25:06.220 --> 25:11.500
piracy got really busted and got out of control and i think about napster and when did napster

25:11.500 --> 25:16.320
really cross the line when like every media outlet started reporting on it and then every

25:16.320 --> 25:20.640
college kid in the nation was using napster to download music off each other and to some

25:20.640 --> 25:24.800
extent yeah the piracy still goes on today but it's not as easy as it used to be right

25:24.800 --> 25:28.640
like remember it used to be like you just download maps napster type in metallica and

25:28.640 --> 25:32.680
bam you get like any song you want it right yeah now you have to download limewire and

25:32.680 --> 25:36.800
type in metallica and then and hopefully you connect to the server and you have to configure

25:36.800 --> 25:41.040
and the thing isn't as user-friendly and you have to configure all that stuff it's not

25:41.040 --> 25:46.820
as easy it's all about bit torrent and you use groups or new use net i'm not saying just

25:46.820 --> 25:51.560
because it's not easy makes it right but i'm just you know that that is true that you know

25:51.560 --> 25:56.360
you're probably never going to eliminate piracy completely but you can make it difficult enough

25:56.360 --> 26:02.440
for that most people aren't going to figure out how to do it or care right yeah loki you're

26:02.440 --> 26:08.360
just an exception you're a special child face it let's give him some donuts all right is

26:08.360 --> 26:14.080
that it for the mailbag that would be it well einhänder is awesome send more email mailbag

26:14.080 --> 26:19.960
orange laws you have einhänder on your psp yeah god damn you mailbag orange launch radio

26:19.960 --> 26:25.160
dot com well this is something else we can get mad about because we didn't have this

26:25.160 --> 26:31.520
this is kind of old news but because it's ending like now but australia actually had

26:31.520 --> 26:37.440
a free xbox live gold service all weekend long that ran this weekend march 9th through

26:37.440 --> 26:42.840
march 11th so if you're an xbox live silver subscriber in australia you got three days

26:42.840 --> 26:49.720
worth of gold so pretty cool there and crackdown appears to be the game that a lot of folks

26:49.720 --> 26:54.080
were going to take advantage of with their free xbox live gold accounts for the weekend

26:54.080 --> 26:58.280
no word on who underwrote it though you know how like last time we got a free weekend wasn't

26:58.280 --> 27:02.520
sponsored by somebody and i completely forgot who it was sponsored by so it must not have

27:02.520 --> 27:07.280
been very effective marketing no discovery channel gave the gears of war maps it wasn't

27:07.280 --> 27:13.320
discovery channel somebody else i don't know was it what i think it was some type of network

27:13.320 --> 27:18.840
or tv show or something i'm sure somebody in chat room remembers who knows i'm trying

27:18.840 --> 27:24.260
to see um maybe not history channel dark knight says history no i don't think it was a history

27:24.260 --> 27:35.600
channel was it i don't know all righty anyways um so people love free xbox live gold weekends

27:35.600 --> 27:43.880
people don't like bullet which and uh bullet which is really bad in fact kotaku among other

27:43.880 --> 27:52.340
people including um was it costume get and gang game rankings.com have been ever so nice

27:52.340 --> 27:58.320
to point out the flaws in bullet which including idiotic ai unfinished graphics and ugly textures

27:58.320 --> 28:04.000
lighted areas too bright no lock on cheap deaths horrendous voice acting cumbersome

28:04.000 --> 28:08.720
systems for casting spells which i might agree that is pretty bad camera angle too low to

28:08.720 --> 28:14.800
the ground and invisible and visible barriers all over the place i don't know it just sounds

28:14.800 --> 28:20.440
to me it's sloppy stuff well a giant brain is kind of cool you know because that's just

28:20.440 --> 28:24.120
an enemy that you fight and the fact that it's a giant brain makes it easier to hit

28:24.120 --> 28:30.120
with their crappy targeting system so i don't know it's okay i think is one of those games

28:30.120 --> 28:35.680
though that probably shouldn't have been brought over here um for you know the full price maybe

28:35.680 --> 28:42.840
well it was $49.99 so maybe $39.99 would have been a better price maybe like they have to

28:42.840 --> 28:49.680
pay us to play it yeah maybe free would have been a better price maybe hey at least it

28:49.680 --> 28:54.280
wasn't as bad as bomberman act zero that is one thing great they could put that on the

28:54.280 --> 28:58.360
sticker a little sticker so you know okie from morrisons radio says hey it wasn't as

28:58.360 --> 29:04.580
bad as bomberman act zero well i have something that should make everybody happy um in regards

29:04.580 --> 29:12.760
to uh xbox live we have the uh classic teenage mutant ninja turtles game going to xbox live

29:12.760 --> 29:20.940
and it's going to be um actually uh out um i believe the date was march 21st which is

29:20.940 --> 29:25.600
right before the movie comes out on march 23rd guys isn't that speculation still because

29:25.600 --> 29:29.640
they don't really ever know for sure what the dates are well yeah that's speculation

29:29.640 --> 29:34.480
but i think that makes sense smart date certainly i know the game's coming out like the actual

29:34.480 --> 29:41.680
tmnt game well um at any rate it's uh going to have two to four player co-op over xbox

29:41.680 --> 29:50.600
live um nothing saying about enhanced modes um it's going to be uh 400 points um you know

29:50.600 --> 29:58.000
that's uh looks like it's going to be really awesome um oh also you can still play it alone

29:58.000 --> 30:06.560
and um it's like co-op if you want it i guess but it's still turtles dibs on leonardo dibs

30:06.560 --> 30:13.560
on donatello for me all right well um you know i i want to address this real quick before

30:13.560 --> 30:17.340
we get into our next segment but i noticed this coming up quite a bit in our chat i've

30:17.340 --> 30:20.860
seen this like twice now the night and it's coming up again and the person who's posting

30:20.860 --> 30:24.240
it has an ol army recruit number in front of them so i can't credit it but somebody

30:24.240 --> 30:30.080
is spreading around this story about mushroom kingdom hearts coming to the nintendo we that

30:30.080 --> 30:35.760
was a it's got to be fake right it's an april fool's joke that's what it is every year they

30:35.760 --> 30:40.880
do an april fool's joke and it's april April fool's day so oh i see so they're the upcoming

30:40.880 --> 30:44.440
april issue of electronic gaming monthly and they always do some stupid ass april fool's

30:44.440 --> 30:50.120
thing all right i get it it's got to be a joke it's a joke it is a joke they even pointed

30:50.120 --> 30:57.020
out that it's a joke yeah all right it's a nice idea but i don't i would like a new mario

30:57.020 --> 31:04.280
rpg yeah but it's never a great idea i think that's why it makes a pretty decent joke but

31:04.280 --> 31:11.120
uh no sorry guys not a reality yeah all right well um since jamie brought up teenage mutant

31:11.120 --> 31:15.920
ninja turtles being confirmed for xbox live arcade and all we thought we'd take this opportunity

31:15.920 --> 31:20.200
to play a little game here on the show that we have not played in a long long long time

31:20.200 --> 31:29.740
so we're gonna play tonight listless here's the way listless works you guys we're gonna

31:29.740 --> 31:33.940
come up with the definitive list around a certain topic and it's been brought to my

31:33.940 --> 31:37.940
attention by a long time listener and staff of the show uh dark to see that we may have

31:37.940 --> 31:42.480
actually done this topic once before but we've deemed uh since it's been at least a year

31:42.480 --> 31:46.380
since we've done this topic and so much has changed we have a lot of new listeners since

31:46.380 --> 31:50.380
the last time we're gonna go ahead and do listless for this topic tonight and the listless

31:50.380 --> 31:57.480
would be teenage mutant ninja turtles was one of the most sought after games for the

31:57.480 --> 32:04.720
xbox live marketplace right um so what arcade game now do people want to see on xbox live

32:04.720 --> 32:10.000
arcade now that ninja turtles has made its way over what games should be next so this

32:10.000 --> 32:13.900
is the way listless works uh each of the three hosts and our special guest who's joining

32:29.640 --> 32:35.720
a list of 12 games and then we're each gonna go around and knock one thing off the list

32:35.720 --> 32:40.520
leaving a list of eight games after that the chat room will vote on their favorites and

32:40.520 --> 32:45.740
we we will get the definitive top one two and three list of the arcade games you would

32:45.740 --> 32:51.760
like to see ported over to xbox live arcade so let's start it off uh who wants to start

32:51.760 --> 32:58.000
off tonight i shall all right ladies first uh what would be your pick for the game you

32:58.000 --> 33:03.120
would most like to see on xbox live marketplace arcade games number three right number three

33:03.120 --> 33:12.120
r-type r-type the arcade r-type why arcade r-type because it's fucking r-type all right

33:12.120 --> 33:19.920
loki won't be your number three pick the arcade version of bionic commando wow that's kind

33:19.920 --> 33:23.780
of obscure how is the arcade version of bionic commando different from the nes for those

33:23.780 --> 33:29.440
that don't know hopefully not by much i don't know better graphics i could just tell you

33:29.440 --> 33:32.720
like i haven't played bionic commando in the arcade but i can tell you that like rygar

33:32.720 --> 33:37.400
in the arcade and on the nes were completely freaking different all right uh mikkel top

33:37.400 --> 33:46.360
why don't you go next your number three pick i would say um the x-men game the six person

33:46.360 --> 33:49.920
yeah yeah that was a good game we talked about that last week here on the show the x-men

33:49.920 --> 33:56.920
game that's a very good choice all right x-men my number three pick would be quiz and dragons

33:56.920 --> 34:02.000
so i can take on bobby blackwolf with the xbox quiz and dragons was this game and it

34:02.000 --> 34:05.680
had like i think they used pretty much the same engine that magic sword and all those

34:05.680 --> 34:11.000
other games magic sword god okay um like it was capcom made right and basically you would

34:11.000 --> 34:15.680
roll dice and go around the board and you would battle monsters like slimes and whatever

34:15.680 --> 34:21.360
and you battled them by answering trivia questions nerd it was awesome but insanely hard so quiz

34:21.360 --> 34:29.960
and dragons my number three pick uh dark soccer my number two is planet harrier why planet

34:29.960 --> 34:35.520
harrier planet harrier has not had a home release of any kind and it was the sequel

34:35.520 --> 34:40.800
to um space harrier which was a really freaking awesome game and i i've played planet harrier

34:40.800 --> 34:46.680
in the arcade it's really really fun and i think that it deserves some sort of home release

34:46.680 --> 34:55.040
all right uh what next loki what would be your number two pick um my number two pick

34:55.040 --> 35:03.280
would be you know actually i would like to see the name i i see the image of the game

35:03.280 --> 35:12.960
i'm just have to go with um you know the beyonce metal slug actually because why the hell not

35:12.960 --> 35:19.200
i mean they're gonna put metal slugging everything rather have some achievements for it all right

35:19.200 --> 35:24.000
metal i can't believe you of all people just said i went i drew more metal slug you obviously

35:24.000 --> 35:34.320
you're drawing a blank all right uh miklata you're number two turtles in time turtles

35:34.320 --> 35:41.400
in time the sequel all right sounds fair it was so much fun to like throw the foot soldiers

35:41.400 --> 35:44.880
at the screen i think that's the one you do it in and like it was like you could do it

35:44.880 --> 35:49.360
in the first one too okay i was originally this is a case where the chat room yelling

35:49.360 --> 35:52.000
out random things can't have influence on this because i'm actually going to pick one

35:52.000 --> 35:57.040
from chat for my number two because um i originally was gonna say rampart because that game was

35:57.040 --> 36:03.440
pretty awesome rampart you don't ever play our key into it was like young it was it was

36:03.440 --> 36:08.200
kind of tetrisy because you would rotate pieces to build a wall but they have it on playstation

36:08.200 --> 36:12.220
three i don't see why they can't have it so i'll take it off since it's on i'm gonna say

36:12.220 --> 36:18.340
i love this idea nba jam totally needs to be on xbox live they have the codes though

36:18.340 --> 36:22.960
for the um mortal kombat character and that game was so that could totally work too because

36:22.960 --> 36:29.280
uh midway puts a bunch of stuff on my i want nba jam fuck yeah i'm putting nba jam down

36:29.280 --> 36:36.760
thank you act up number one pick dark sakura radiant silver gun oh good pick radiant silver

36:36.760 --> 36:42.760
gun because because it's freaking treasure it's treasure and by the way i do agree with

36:42.760 --> 36:50.200
gs68 for blazing star but um but no it's got to be it's got to be radiant silver gun all

36:50.200 --> 36:56.720
right uh loki your number one pick you know i had a couple things and i just thought of

36:56.720 --> 37:02.760
my second uh pick but i can't remember the game's called so whatever um so my number

37:02.760 --> 37:08.160
one pick is gonna be simpsons the arcade game oh good pick good pick my my number two instead

37:08.160 --> 37:12.160
of metal slug should have been i and i can't remember those hentai puzzle games i kept

37:12.160 --> 37:18.320
on the plane because those are fun the hentai kicks thing i remember what it was called

37:18.320 --> 37:24.920
though oh you should just say gals panic that's what it was gals panic will we allow loki

37:24.920 --> 37:31.320
to remove metal slug and put in gals panic sure all right fine we will allow metal slug

37:31.320 --> 37:37.120
to come off the list in favor of gals panic there you go gals panic that's the first time

37:37.120 --> 37:40.480
we've ever done that on a listless segment by the way allowed that to get changed all

37:40.480 --> 37:44.640
right um mikotov you looked a little pissed off when loki took simpsons the arcade game

37:44.640 --> 37:49.680
did you come up with a new number one i'm trying so hard but like that's all the arcade

37:49.680 --> 37:54.600
games i played shall we go to the chat rooms for some ideas let me look at them would you

37:54.600 --> 37:58.680
like me to read them to you um i'm just i can't credit all these because a lot of folks

37:58.680 --> 38:06.080
are just yelling them out uh super super off-road moonwalker arcade uh dungeons and dragons

38:06.080 --> 38:15.880
shadows over misteria um can i pick a ticket game no you can't do a ticket game um no there's

38:15.880 --> 38:23.180
this crazy climber um no there's this game that everybody without getting it was by midway

38:23.180 --> 38:27.920
and it had it had like a joystick and trackball and it was like first person shooter or third

38:27.920 --> 38:31.760
person shooter type the grid the grid yeah you want the grid yeah i want the grid all

38:31.760 --> 38:35.480
right the grid we just talked about that earlier in the show where were you well i was drooling

38:35.480 --> 38:42.360
over starbucks my fault all right yeah yeah uh shane comes back in here and goes you guys

38:42.360 --> 38:47.960
want anything from starbucks i'm like they're going back all right uh my number one pick

38:47.960 --> 38:54.040
would be super puzzle fighter 2 turbo because that game was awesome and especially with

38:54.040 --> 38:58.240
dance puzzle jojo and why not because they have you know street fighter 2 up why not

38:58.240 --> 39:05.480
give us puzzle fighter 2 probably because the joystick sucks that's funny because act

39:05.480 --> 39:08.920
deaf said that again in chat but i actually had that written down before he said that

39:08.920 --> 39:12.760
act deaf and i are on very similar wavelengths tonight apparently so there you have it here's

39:12.760 --> 39:19.880
the list this is stands so far before the elimination part of this list we have arcade

39:19.880 --> 39:29.160
r-type bionic commando x-men quiz and dragons planet harrier gals panic turtles in time

39:29.160 --> 39:37.320
nba jam radiant silver gun simpsons the grid and super puzzle fighter 2 turbo which of

39:37.320 --> 39:47.320
these games is not worthy of being on the list dark sakura the grid oh the grid gets

39:47.320 --> 39:51.120
denied i'm not very fond of that game miklotov says you know what i pulled that out of my

39:51.120 --> 39:55.680
ass anyway so i'm okay with that elimination loki which of these games does not deserve

39:55.680 --> 40:05.080
to be on the list um you know i would actually say well nba jam just because there's no way

40:05.080 --> 40:10.040
there would be i mean it'd be nice such a cock but they can't do it blame ea they have

40:10.040 --> 40:14.240
the rights to the nba franchise for years and years and years well actually no they

40:14.240 --> 40:20.840
do it's the nfl not the nba right oh you're right you're right my mistake so uh next yeah

40:20.840 --> 40:25.920
fine it'll stay um radiant silver gun because there's gonna be already like ikaru and a

40:25.920 --> 40:33.760
bunch of other shit coming to live okay silver gun is unique it's gone no one anymore please

40:33.760 --> 40:40.920
okay no donut for you bye bye radiant silver gun nice knowing you all right and and it's

40:40.920 --> 40:44.280
funny because chat room was like fuck you loki fuck you and then i retract that fuck

40:44.280 --> 40:50.320
you uh miklotov which of these comes off the list oh yeah these have these which one of

40:50.320 --> 40:55.020
these uh does not deserve to be on the list um quiz and dragons because it's too nerdy

40:55.020 --> 41:00.240
for that list i kind of i kind of accepted the fact that quiz and dragons would come

41:00.240 --> 41:07.120
off the list so i'm okay with that um and i will um help jamie out and take a little

41:07.120 --> 41:11.740
revenge on loki but um not how you think i'm gonna take off bionic commando because come

41:11.740 --> 41:16.160
on he couldn't even tell me what was different from the nes version the nes version has better

41:16.160 --> 41:21.040
graphics that's it no the nes version is awesome it's like what's the difference between contra

41:21.040 --> 41:25.480

41:25.480 --> 41:29.960

fighter 2 turbo what arcade games should they port next to xbox live arcade we'll have the

42:16.720 --> 42:20.800
results later in the show it'd be awesome oh good it's a good thing you said the x-men

42:20.800 --> 42:25.480
game because the other game i would have mentioned was the uh avengers game because the avengers

42:25.480 --> 42:29.940
game i've been like everybody knows i've been getting back into my whole obsession with

42:29.940 --> 42:35.160
captain america and i love the avengers so i've been like actually downloading them we

42:35.160 --> 42:40.920
we actually uh played that the other day the old game i was gonna say uh i don't think

42:40.920 --> 42:46.560
they would put gals panic on live arcade because it's too pornographic for them it's a fun

42:46.560 --> 42:51.600
game though they could do girls of xbox well they have was it they don't they have the

42:51.600 --> 42:57.600
one that's not gals panic but it's like gals panic but in 3d that it's not nudity but it's

42:57.600 --> 43:02.360
just you know scantily clad you know it's broth and pennies exactly the brawn panty

43:02.360 --> 43:06.760
game you should just call it that so that if you can have dead or alive extreme beach

43:06.760 --> 43:11.680
volleyball whatever then you can have that all right that game sucks does it i i still

43:11.680 --> 43:18.360

43:26.240 --> 43:31.140
you should come over for like for a barbecue at christine's birthday i have an engagement

43:31.140 --> 43:35.680
somewhere else i'll tell you offline because you're more than invited which i told you

43:35.680 --> 43:39.760
about the stream beach volleyball olr extreme beach volleyball i think not if you want to

43:39.760 --> 43:44.680
see me in a speedo you need help i played volleyball in high school did you yes i did

43:44.680 --> 43:49.600
because um i don't know why the they would always make me the server because i was short

43:49.600 --> 43:55.360
and i couldn't spike you played volleyball in high school okay wow did it but was it

43:55.360 --> 44:01.840
sunny enough in kansas to actually play volleyball oh it was indoor volleyball all right i played

44:01.840 --> 44:06.640
uh marching band that's that was my sport i was a marching band too and your book something

44:06.640 --> 44:10.080
else i played a lot of in high school that i haven't played a lot of since is earthworm

44:10.080 --> 44:16.800
gym and guess what dave perry the shiny entertainment founder has hinted uh that a new earthworm

44:16.800 --> 44:22.360
gym game is going to quote happen eventually apparently they have put together the pieces

44:22.360 --> 44:28.120
of the development team uh to revive this game that originally came out in 1994 you

44:28.120 --> 44:31.520
might remember it was the game where you could like launch cows and i remember the burping

44:31.520 --> 44:35.960
theme so i went earthworm gym like when you like somebody burped the title and they recorded

44:35.960 --> 44:40.120
it because that's how mature earthworm gym was of a game i think it would be kind of

44:40.120 --> 44:43.440
fun to see that come back why do i have a feeling this might be an xbox live arcade

44:43.440 --> 44:49.960
title i don't does it does it does it scream xbox live to anyone else is it just me yeah

44:49.960 --> 44:56.400
it does no we'll see so um they did didn't they do like a 3d remake of it or something

44:56.400 --> 45:01.880
like that that came out on the psp you're thinking of bubsy i think no no i'm thinking

45:01.880 --> 45:06.920
earth was a gym yeah i don't know there was like a quasi 3d remake or something somebody

45:06.920 --> 45:11.960
i just yeah ew 3d earthworm gym the new earthworm gym better be 2d so apparently there was one

45:11.960 --> 45:18.240
i just never played it i guess that's a good thing anyways so um well earthworm gym you

45:18.240 --> 45:23.920
know it's a great game the question is how do you get your girlfriend to play games with

45:23.920 --> 45:29.440
you speaking of which you have excellent timing there is a list that's been posted on the

45:29.440 --> 45:34.960
internet how to get your girlfriend to play video games with you you put lots of naked

45:34.960 --> 45:40.240
people in it you put things that she likes in it and not things you like in it i don't

45:40.240 --> 45:44.540
know number one they say find out if your girlfriend has ever played video games she

45:44.540 --> 45:49.960
may not be a full-blown gamer but she may have played mario games when she was younger

45:49.960 --> 45:54.120
and she may play games on the internet and stuff like that um to remind your girlfriend

45:54.120 --> 45:59.320
that if you both play games you'll be able to spend even more quality time together bullshit

45:59.320 --> 46:04.440
um pick out games she might like if you're not 100 sure she'll enjoy it you can rent

46:04.440 --> 46:10.880
it uh try to choose a game or system um that isn't too confusing and doesn't require short

46:10.880 --> 46:16.560
reaction time because because girls are feeble-minded apparently that's what i was just thinking

46:16.560 --> 46:21.360
oh because my female brain can't figure out these buttons well the voice you're hearing

46:21.360 --> 46:25.960
by the way is loki's wife nelly oh i'm sorry hi i'm nelly that's right and i'm retarded

46:25.960 --> 46:31.680
because i can't figure out buttons what do i do with this i don't know where does the

46:31.680 --> 46:37.640
thingy go uh if you can get a game that is multiplayer optimally co-op and says consider

46:37.640 --> 46:41.440
your girlfriend's personality when picking out a game some girls may prefer brightly

46:41.440 --> 46:47.760
colored all ages games like katamari bust a move or lego star wars sims or any mario

46:47.760 --> 46:51.520
game but remember if your girlfriend is an individual who could just as well go for halo

46:51.520 --> 46:56.160
resident evil or grand theft auto or nelly's case dead or alive extreme beach volleyball

46:56.160 --> 47:00.700
too don't get games that involve things like strippers prostitutes sex unless she has a

47:00.700 --> 47:05.520
sense of humor about the subject well i yeah it's a good thing that they added the sense

47:05.520 --> 47:10.240
of humor thing but i was about to disagree and it says have fun when you play with her

47:10.240 --> 47:16.600
even if you make a good time she'll enjoy it even if she's not into games and yada yada

47:16.600 --> 47:22.240
yada and basically um i don't know so they have a whole bunch of tips out there it's

47:22.240 --> 47:28.960
on wikihow.com get your girlfriend to play video games if you're really interested in

47:28.960 --> 47:34.880
i just say you know like nelly said make sure that there's porn in there or something or

47:34.880 --> 47:41.200
incentives get rez with the trans vibrator there you go all right well every week on

47:41.200 --> 47:45.240
this program dark sakura likes to surf the internet up and down and left and right and

47:45.240 --> 47:49.640
back and forth uh whatever she the ddr steps are that she's dancing to this week will be

47:49.640 --> 47:54.780
the world wide web surfing to find the website of the week to share with you all here on

47:54.780 --> 47:59.040
orange lounge radio so dark sakura what is your website of the week um you picked it

47:59.040 --> 48:04.760
out i helped you you asked for ideas i gave you ideas but it would have been one that

48:04.760 --> 48:10.340
i would have used um it's potterpuppetpals.com which i think was down for a while but um

48:10.340 --> 48:16.040
and really it's just you know the ones that came out in the actual puppet version um with

48:16.040 --> 48:24.040
the sexy snape animation and uh the muggle pants animation and stuff like that so potterpuppetpals

48:24.040 --> 48:34.100
it's snape let's bother him um is that just potterpuppetpals.com yeah all right my favorite

48:34.100 --> 48:40.560
part of that is every time snake comes out and like i snake the potion master i was like

48:40.560 --> 48:46.920
yeah all right that was a very brief website of the week that's what happens when i suggest

48:46.920 --> 48:50.680
it then dark sakura doesn't have anything to say about it really all right well if you

48:50.680 --> 48:56.720
want to talk about something cooler than potter puppet pals uh let's talk resistance fall man

48:56.720 --> 49:01.760
it's getting updated soon it's gonna have um some brand new multiplayer content as well

49:01.760 --> 49:08.880
as um some episodic content new modes and maps and whatnot so that's kind of cool and

49:08.880 --> 49:14.880
apparently on march 23rd uh coinciding with the european launch they're going to launch

49:14.880 --> 49:19.840
the two multiplayer modes which is team conversion uh basically the conversion mode with teams

49:19.840 --> 49:26.840
and assault and where you destroy your team's defending base and they're also adding a spectator

49:26.840 --> 49:33.400
camera mode as well and um later on we should be getting some more story elements um in

49:33.400 --> 49:37.160
the form of episodic content so i'm glad to see that they're actually doing some stuff

49:37.160 --> 49:40.840
with this game because it is pretty an awesome game it's just you know once you finish with

49:40.840 --> 49:46.020
it i guess multiplayer is the only thing left for you like go back through the game get

49:46.020 --> 49:51.800
some more weapons but that's about it fun though all righty well we're going to open

49:51.800 --> 49:56.000

51:42.840 --> 51:48.360
beatmania game 10th style and i just want to shout out a quick review for it oh sure

51:48.360 --> 51:53.960
beatmania 10th style now this is an import game right yeah it's an import game so i have

51:53.960 --> 51:59.000
to use uh swap magic all right well tell it or you have to own a japanese playstation

51:59.000 --> 52:06.400
too like i actually own one uh it has a lot of dust on it but i have one yeah well tell

52:06.400 --> 52:15.760
us your review uh beatmania 10th style well it has my favorite song list in it and uh

52:15.760 --> 52:21.280
i heard a lot of complaints about it on uh just some of the various bimani communities

52:21.280 --> 52:29.080
but i didn't really see it i mean it was what were some of the complaints i don't know like

52:29.080 --> 52:35.760
i just heard that it was bad just people going this sucks you can't ever you can't ever take

52:35.760 --> 52:39.760
that for an answer though you can't let somebody go this sucks you got it why why does it suck

52:39.760 --> 52:47.760
yeah the only thing that i ever heard about it that was legitimate was that it's where

52:47.760 --> 52:53.640
the difficulty really started ramping up there are a few songs in there where the difficulty

52:53.640 --> 53:00.120
just starts getting a little intense but um overall i mean i think it has the best song

53:00.120 --> 53:06.240
list out of uh the releases that i've played it does have a pretty solid song list i remember

53:06.240 --> 53:13.240
that what uh what types of songs would bimani fans be uh happy to know or in the game well

53:13.240 --> 53:20.760
um there was eggsy on by led light and there uh there was a lot of uh sampling masters

53:20.760 --> 53:24.600
sampling masters was really heavy in there there was both rattle the mercury and rattle

53:24.600 --> 53:34.280
the sun of some sampling masters is stuff 108 daddy daddy it was really it was a talk

53:34.280 --> 53:40.320
heavy um mixed there was a lot of there's a lot of talk songs in there if i've never

53:40.320 --> 53:45.360
played a beatmania 2dx game before in my life but i just happen to have you know a playstation

53:45.360 --> 53:49.960
2 japanese or a swapper or whatever do you think the beatmania 2dx 10 style is a good

53:49.960 --> 53:56.800
entry into the series for someone entry level it depends because i'm training somebody right

53:56.800 --> 54:01.360
now and they seem to really like and be able to play a lot of them but if you've never

54:01.360 --> 54:07.380
played before i'd say maybe this one's just a little too hard because after maybe the

54:07.380 --> 54:14.280
first five songs the difficulty starts to ramp up a bit so maybe not ten style but ten

54:14.280 --> 54:18.400
style would be an awesome second or third game all right well there you have it any

54:18.400 --> 54:26.720
final thoughts for our listeners paradox vincent on uh comment on the uh getting girls to play

54:26.720 --> 54:35.800
games segments actually um like some of the games that i found worked really good were

54:35.800 --> 54:46.560
you know katamari and uh ddr actually but no rez rez didn't work rez doesn't work even

54:46.560 --> 54:55.040
with the attachment huh even with the trans vibrator attachment well i don't know about

54:55.040 --> 55:01.360
the trans vibrator attachment maybe you need to have her take a second look uh maybe all

55:01.360 --> 55:05.360
right paradox vincent thanks so much for the call uh we appreciate it and have fun with

55:05.360 --> 55:12.120
your beatmania 2dx 10 style oh i will all righty and uh uni uh is in chat saying uh

55:12.120 --> 55:21.080
i play games and i'm a girl indeed you are let's go over to the chat you know i i again

55:21.080 --> 55:24.640
there's i guess there's just a difference though i i think when we read these stories

55:24.640 --> 55:29.320
about how do we get girls into gaming they mean the casual gaming girl i think not the

55:29.320 --> 55:33.880
hardcore gamer nerds you know like you and i regardless of sex you know and all that

55:33.880 --> 55:39.160
i don't know all right uh let's go back to the phone lines take another call uh hello

55:39.160 --> 55:45.240
you're on orange launch radio who's this good evening this is dmn hi dmn god you get through

55:45.240 --> 55:50.360
every week what's on your mind um first of all sorry for making you all listen to that

55:50.360 --> 55:54.360
song folks who are listening to the podcast only have no idea what you're talking about

55:54.360 --> 55:59.440
it was a bonus segment tonight so there you have it it'll be on stfu a nice plug appreciate

55:59.440 --> 56:04.200
that thursday night seven o'clock right well i was gonna plug it later on but first things

56:04.200 --> 56:10.920
first review of ssx blur um the game's amazing i highly recommend it if you want to we um

56:10.920 --> 56:16.560
it feels a lot like it feels a lot like ssx 3 and ssx tricky um not as not so much as

56:16.560 --> 56:23.300
on tour which i really didn't like um it's 50 definitely recommend it what if i've never

56:23.300 --> 56:30.160
played ssx before in my life what do i have to look forward to um if this is your first

56:30.160 --> 56:36.440
ssx game you may be a little diff it may be a little difficult for you um the the thing

56:36.440 --> 56:43.080
that's really difficult is uh excuse me the thing that's really difficult in that game

56:43.080 --> 56:46.680
is moving around and doing tricks um because they do it a lot differently than you would

56:46.680 --> 56:53.360
with a dualshock 2 controller um once once you get accustomed to that though um as the

56:53.360 --> 56:58.340
tutorial does a great job of get having you get the hang of it it's a lot of fun when

56:58.340 --> 57:07.560
will ssx tricky come out an ssx blur when people don't give a shit about ao ratings

57:07.560 --> 57:11.640
all right fair enough anything else that you've played this week you want to share with our

57:11.640 --> 57:16.680
listeners about um no i'm getting back into a leap eat agents though i'm getting psyched

57:16.680 --> 57:20.440

57:20.440 --> 57:26.060
that that news just came out recently as well um i was going to ask you uh you have not

57:26.060 --> 57:29.500
been the biggest sony fan in the past from what i remember what did you think about their

57:29.500 --> 57:34.960
announcements this week i'm excited for them um the playstation home looks fantastic yeah

57:34.960 --> 57:42.080
i could i could play the ripoff card but i'm not going to um little big planet looks awesome

57:42.080 --> 57:49.620
um not something that's going to make me drop 600 on a ps3 but it's a great idea and i really

57:49.620 --> 57:54.200
hope it gets off the ground all right well anything else you want to share with our listeners

57:54.200 --> 58:00.520
dmn yes um we're introducing over the next month a new segment a new recorded segment

58:00.520 --> 58:05.240
after stfu it is the month of march march managed with basketball so i thought i'd throw

58:05.240 --> 58:11.880
together a little tournament called ddr madness 64 ddr and in the groove songs you guys vote

58:11.880 --> 58:16.840
to determine which is the best one but if it's ddr madness why do you have in the groove

call here hi you're on orange launch radio who's this it's legend azaku hi legend azaku

59:22.760 --> 59:30.000
what's on your mind buddy um just just ranting on the internets in particular how people

59:30.000 --> 59:37.080
are just bitching and moaning about you know how how the ps1 ps3 game unreal 2003 is actually

59:37.080 --> 59:41.280
getting keyboard and mouse support i would like to see that as an itune review by the

59:41.280 --> 59:48.880
way as an itunes review of this program that's just ranting on the internets yeah yeah sorry

59:48.880 --> 59:54.320
go ahead as you know they're saying that it's going to give you know pc gamers who basically

59:54.320 --> 59:59.240
grew up on keyboard mouse myself uh it's going to give them an advantage over the the folks

59:59.240 --> 01:00:05.920
that use access just to play the game and there's just uh some back and forth arguing

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:09.920
well what do you think is it really that big a deal or should people just shut up about

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:14.360
it or what the only exceptions to con you know the only good controls that i've seen

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:21.760
so far you know in console first person shooters is golden eye and perfect dark that's it because

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:26.360
they had that they had the benefit of the you know the the joystick on the n64 and it

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:35.020
actually felt nice on your hands whereas you know stuff like halo honestly you know personally

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:40.360
i found it really hard to just you know to actually aim and i found that and i found

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.600
it very difficult with every other first person shooter that i've seen on the console it's

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.000
just it was just horrible but now that they had a keyboard and mouse i could pretty much

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.200
it's easier for me to transition this is you know but then on the other side you could

01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:01.600
actually use six axis you know you know to aim to move the to move the aim you know to

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.480
move you know to basically aim up and down and then you can just use the t-pad to move

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.520
to move forward backwards side to side since you since you brought up halo you know there

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.720
are current existing 360 games that will use any usb keyboard final fantasy 11 is what

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:20.800
i'm thinking of right but the halo 3 ought to accept a mouse and a keyboard usb mouse

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.640
and usb keyboard as possible control devices just to throw the piece of gamers a bone at

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:31.000
least because you know they're still out there and that that would pretty much on getting

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.160
halo 3 if it had that i could just hook up a you know mouse and keyboard and then i could

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.960
just you know play at my in my own comfort zone without having to go through hell trying

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:45.440
to learn the controls and trying to be good at it hmm interesting all right well any other

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:52.840

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:10.240
good radio rob way to go yeah he's just yeah way to go rob go to bathroom hi what a wuss

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:21.200
hello hi hey what's on your mind i got a question what i got a question for you i read an article

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.640
on consumers sometime back about people complaining about game stop the fact that they open up

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.400
all the video games and put it out on display and then when they sell them they sell them

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:35.600
at the full price they'd rather not knock a couple bucks off um what do you think about

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.440
that well first of all i have no affiliation with game shop whatsoever anymore

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:47.920
that's fine but honestly they don't do that with all of their games that's like the last

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:54.120
one and it hasn't been played the disc has not been physically touched on the thing it

01:03:54.120 --> 01:04:00.280
has not been inside of the system it is an unused game it is only that the case has been

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:06.800
opened correct you're right on that but i guess from my point of view from working retail

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:13.320
it seems like it belongs in box status where you won't still new it's open and technically

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.880
you really can't say it's new so you're not a couple of dollars off it's sort of like

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:21.560
a shade of gray when you think about it i think open box really should apply to uh like

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:28.600
hardware like appliances the same thing thinking with demos and shoes as well but i remember

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.920
i was with a friend of mine you know my friend patty we were looking for a game we found

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:38.200
it but they would not get a couple bucks or because it was open it was like a display

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.760
box you know they took the game out and all of that and the boxes are a little bit faded

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:47.540
i mean at least they could at least get stumped well i think that um well okay look at it

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:50.820
this way um if ever you go to the bookstore and you have books that are shrink wrapped

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:54.560
you know but you have books that are unwrapped they're still going to sell you the book at

01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:00.480
the same at the same price unless the book itself is damaged if the game is not damaged

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:06.920
If the case is not damaged, then there's no reason for them to make any differentiation

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:07.920
between it.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:13.480
You're right, but it's just that some people argue about that.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.880
I mean, that's one of the reasons I try not to shop at GameStop unless I really have to,

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:18.880
you know?

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:24.880
Well, I don't shop at GameStop anymore at all, so don't blame me there.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.880
Go to GameCrazy.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.640
There's no GameCrazies out here in New York, not that I know of.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:34.960
They should be attached to a Hollywood video, if you got them.

01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.480
We have a Hollywood video, but there is no GameCrazies there.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.480
That's sad.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:42.480
Around here in New York City, you have the local shop, Best Buy, Cirque du Sole, if you

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.040
like me, there's a GameCrazy store.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:47.280
Well, GameCrazy sells old games, and that's why I love them.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.160
Not just because Dan Mina works there.

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.240
Well, it works for me, definitely.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.880
All right, well, it sounds...

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.120
Is there anything else, Rama?

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.720
I want to call you out, Skye.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.400
I'm tired of you talking trash about Vista.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.400
I don't...

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.400
I'm tired of it.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.760
I'm not really talking a lot of trash about Vista.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.880
I'm just not that interested in it.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.720
Yeah, but the thing is, there's no Windows XP.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.480
Every popular XP coming out, oh, new upgrades, brand new hardware.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:19.720
By the time the new OS came out, it's definitely time to upgrade, because it's been like maybe

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.840
two or three years since the last upgrade.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:27.080
Since it was Vista, it's been a while since, you know, the last operating system was with

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.080
XP.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.400
We got newer hardware for Vista to support, and people complain about bugs left and right.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:37.880
A lot of those bugs do not even apply unless you're like a hardcore, higher-end user doing

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.160
stuff you shouldn't even be doing.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.160
Why should I upgrade to Vista?

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:47.920
Well, personally, because if there are newer hardware that's coming out that XP may not

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:54.320
be able to support, and the fact that XP and Vista is more secure, is more stable, I've

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.320
been...

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.800
But that's Microsoft being a cunt about it.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:02.400
I mean, seriously, because the new hardware doesn't have to lock out XP.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:09.560
So besides the fact that, you know, I'm not going to have much choice to upgrade to Vista,

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.320
why do I need to upgrade to Vista now?

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:18.440
Well, to be perfectly honest, I can't say now, because if that was the case, I'd worry

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.440
I'd update it.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.120
Drew and I, he's already updated.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.000
I'm waiting a month before I get all my hardware upgrade ready to go, because I want to really

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.840
try out this copy that's out in stores, because I shouldn't be really famous, but I was a

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:35.280
beta tester, and I've been playing around with it since it was Lobo, and I've seen the

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.280
changes from like 2004 all the way up to now.

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.520
Ram, I've got to be honest, you're not selling it to me.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:46.240
I mean, you're telling me that because everyone else is doing it, I should do it?

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.840
I'm doing the best that I can.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.080
I work retail, you know?

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.080
I know, you don't work retail.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.080
I'm going to be perfectly honest.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:56.200
Look, let me tell you straight up, honestly, if you don't want to upgrade to Vista, that's

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.200
fine.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.560
I mean, to each his own.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:01.440
Me personally, I plan on doing the upgrade in due time.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.280
XP is still going to be around for a couple of years.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.240
The only time Microsoft is really going to force everyone to upgrade to Vista is when

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.800
they say, oh, we're no longer supporting Windows XP.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.800
All right.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.160
I'm going to read some chat comments on this and then wrap up here.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:18.040
I see James Patrick says, you can control audio for every separate program in Vista.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.920
I'm trying to help you out there with some good reasons.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.920
Let's see.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.920
What was it?

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.520
Somebody has said they are on Windows.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:28.760
Oh, NM64 says, Vista, heck, I still prefer Windows 2000.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.760
There you go.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:30.760
All right.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.560
Well, Ram, we've got to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:36.480
Any last words for our listeners?

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.760
Listen to uni's radio or shout cat.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.600
I don't remember the name of it, but she should be posting in the chat room.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.600
All right.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.000
I'm sure she appreciates the plug.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Take care.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
No problem.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Bye.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
But don't listen to it right now, because we're on the air.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
All right.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Take care.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
All right.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.840
Thanks so much for the call, and we're going to go ahead and shut off the Skype line now.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.960
Thank you so much to those of you that got through tonight and participated in the show.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.520
We appreciate it as always.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:08.280
I'm going to go around and ask if there's any last minute stories, dark soccer, anything?

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:15.480
Not particularly, just I'd like to remind everybody that I'm really awesome, and okay.

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.480
That's not a story.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.680
Loki.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.360
There was a thing that's coming out in Japan that's actually kind of funny.

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:28.160
It's a painting program for the DS, and you basically paint like those paint by number

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:34.000
things, but for the DS, so it's like a coloring book.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.320
Sounds kind of interesting.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.320
Not really.

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.320
Yeah.

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.320
Not really.

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:44.120
I got to send an interesting last minute story here.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:48.280
This was sent to me via email by Brad from PodCulture.net.

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.600
Let's see.

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:58.840
A Japanese man has blamed his six axis for a new impotence problem.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:04.600
Mr. Aoi Bailey says he cannot get an erection anymore.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.880
He says having his controller in his lap in close proximity to his penis has left him

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.280
unable to perform.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.000
He thinks the controller is sending out a Bluetooth frequency that can cause bodily

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
harm.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.720
He has contacted Sony to find out if he's not the only one having problem from the PlayStation

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.720
3 controller, but has yet to get a response.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.920
Bailey plans on going to the doctor this week to try to get some answers.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.960
So Bluetooth gives you impotence apparently.

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:31.840
What the hell is this?

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.360
I think he just has emotional problems, and that's why he's impotent.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.520
Why is he trying to play the game with his penis anyway?

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.680
It sounds like he's trying to put the controller right there to maybe look at a picture of

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.680
a pretty girl.

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:45.800
I don't know about you, but when I play the game, I don't have my hand down there.

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.560
I have the controller in my hands.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.520
That's the Al Bundy way of playing video games.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.560
One hand down your pants, there you go.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:58.400
That's awfully lazy, and to be honest, I don't see that.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.060
That's stupid.

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.160
How old is this guy?

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.160
It didn't say.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.640
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.640
I'm betting it's not anything that has to do with...

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.000
Well, here's what it is.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.840
It's because the fucking imagery from the PlayStation 3 is so fucking sexy, his wife

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.800
just doesn't do it for him anymore.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.500
Nintendo Maniac 64 wants to know, why would you put the six axis on your dick?

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.720
There's no rumble.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.520
I guess that's a good question to ask.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:31.640
One of the OL Army recruits, meaning they haven't changed their nickname yet, says,

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:34.800
that's how the power glove was invented.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.200
Now you're playing with power.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.200
That's so bad.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:43.980
All right, well, let's go around, if there's no more last minute stories, and get everybody's

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:44.980
final thought.

01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.680
We'll start with you tonight, Dark Sakura.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.640
What's your final thought?

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.840
Give me money.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.040
My final thought is Guinness.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.800
That's my final thought, because I've had like three glasses of it this week.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:57.800
It's good stuff.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.920
Loki, your final thought, please.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:07.080
My final thought is, it's a lot harder to put PlayStation 1 games on your PSP.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.720
Were you successful in your attempts?

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:13.800
I put it on there, but the thing is, you need to have a bunch of different files from Hot

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:19.960
Shots 2, actually from the PlayStation Store, and then, because with each firmware update,

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:25.880
they change the encoding on the PS1 games, so say, for example, you find a game you like

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:30.280
online that someone's already converted over, it will only work for one type of the custom

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.600
firmware, which I don't have that type, so it's a pain in the ass.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:36.600
All right.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.240
Well, thank you guys so much for tuning into and supporting independent podcasting.

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.240
You guys are awesome.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.840
Remember, we do this for free for you guys, so if you like what you hear, please tell

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.620
two friends about Orange Lounge Radio, because that way, if you tell two friends, then they

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:50.600
tell two friends, and so on and so on.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.140
We slowly take over the world.

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.140
That's how it works.

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:56.800
That's how we get our name out there, because we don't have any big corporate magazine or

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.760
game company or website that backs us.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.920
We're just us, free gamers like you guys.

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:05.000
Thanks so much to our chat room for joining us tonight, and thanks so much to all our

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
callers tonight.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Have a great week.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000
We'll see you next week.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Are you going to be here, Darksara?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
I know you had a week off coming up.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.080
Are you here next week?

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.440
I don't know.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.600
There's some week you had off.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:18.320
I don't remember if it was this week or next, but hopefully, we will all be here next week,

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.560
but if not, then some of us will see you here next week on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.560
Take care.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.560
