Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, March 4th, 2007, drama ensues over Sony's rumored PlayStation Home.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We talk about who is starting an anti-weed campaign.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The popular new computer game is rumored to be making a jump to Xbox Live.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, on their iPods, their Zens, whatever devices you're using to listen to us.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Maybe your Xbox 360, thanks to the 360 cast or whatever that thing was called.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We are a show dedicated to video games and gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yo.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How you doing, Miss Jamie Summers?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Ow.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Ow? What's wrong? Your head hurt?

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Female ow.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, I see. The TMI type of ow, huh?

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Sorry to hear it. Well, I'm sure we'll have some extra special eff you use tonight.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But overall, a good weekend. Jamie and I had a play day yesterday in San Francisco. That was fun.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It was pretty fun. And we both have really hot hair now.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, we got our hair done. That's the first time I've ever paid $45 for a haircut.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But it looks nice.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Be glad. You know how much I pay for mine.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Isn't that a sexist thing?

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I have more hair, and I have more shit done to my hair.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What if I was a dude with long hair?

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They'd probably charge you more.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You think?

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Not that I would ever have long hair, but I've seen guys with longer hair than a lot of women I know.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, like Marissa's boyfriend.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, that's true. Yeah.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He's got gorgeous, gorgeous supermodel hair.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If I remember right, I think he chopped it off at one point.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But remember Blue from DER Freak, who's really into pump it up? Didn't he have kind of long hair?

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He almost had it in a ponytail, didn't he?

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, he had really, really long hair.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, that's who I kind of think of. I remember him.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Anyway, say hello as well.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Before we talk about people who aren't here to defend themselves too much, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, I'm here.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How you doing, Loki?

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm doing good.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Great.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I see you have not one, but two PSPs up and running with Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Are you playing against yourself tonight? What is going on here?

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, I was just testing stuff.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He's playing with himself on my radio.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Fun. What types of things are you testing out?

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Just Dark Alex's custom firmware, because it allowed me to run PS1 games on it.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Wow, that's like three weeks in a row, four weeks in a row?

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think that that's fantastic, because right when you made that little announcement, we have the doom and gloom music stuff.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No, actually that reminds me...

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I should just do that every week, because I never forget to...

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Just so you know what goes on behind the scenes, obviously we have a playlist set up with all the music that we're going to use, the incidental music during the show already set up.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And I'm supposed to hit stop before the next song comes on, because we put little breaks in the playlist, but sometimes I forget to hit stop.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Anyways...

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Such as I've done for the past three weeks.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've got a nice firmware that I got. I've got a nice 2GIG memory stick so I can put PlayStation 1 games on there.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So that's kind of what I was doing, because I have this other PlayStation, or PSP, and I'm like, well what the hell am I going to do with this thing?

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So load up a custom firmware and I can make it all pretty, because you can edit all the icons, you can edit the waves in the background, everything.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And you run homebrew off of a memory stick, plus you can run programs that require firmware 310, or 303 I guess.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And so it's like the best of both worlds.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alright.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Also joining us tonight, we don't have any other guests in studio, that's a first.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We haven't had that in a long time, so it's going to be a relatively quiet show tonight, I don't know.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We'll see.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The three of us will entertain you the best we can, but of course we always have our invisible other guests with us every week.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The chat room, and that's accessible over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
XBStream, that's the name of the Xbox 360 program I was trying to think of at the beginning.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can listen to us on XBStream, we're one of the default podcasts.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I forgot about that.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you to the XBStream folks, and don't be too mad at me for forgetting your name.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's see, looking at the chat room there.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
AlphaKennogram says, the soundboard is cursed!

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We don't really use a soundboard, it's just Winamp, nothing too fancy.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's Rob.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's my fault.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Actually if I did switch to a soundboard it would probably be easier, but I don't like the whole soundboard setup thing.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Plus I feel like if I had a soundboard, I would use it far too much.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Not to say there's other shows out there that do use it too much, but I'm just thinking that we probably use it too much.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Blaze says that three weeks in a row they've effed up the soundboard.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I didn't eff up anything, I was sitting here in my chair, sitting here.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Alright, let's see, Damony says I got Crash Bandicoot on my PSP.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Remember when Crash Bandicoot was cool before it went the way of Spyro and all those other franchises, they just drove into the ground?

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, I never remember it being cool.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It was cool at one point.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Crash Bandicoot 2 was the first PlayStation game I ever owned.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I never remember that game being cool.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, whatever.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's see, what else is here?

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Fireboma says, anyway, anyone here play Magic?

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Like the Gathering?

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Haven't since I was in college the first time around.

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Dude, I sold my deck when I was a junior in high school, which was a long time ago, over ten years ago if you can believe it.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And it's still going strong.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I remember the old computer game.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Not the one you could play online, but the very first computer game that ever came out.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I really liked that.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I remember you walked around a map and battled other people.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I should try and find that and play it again.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It was kind of fun, but I don't think they really make it anymore because didn't they go online with it?

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And then they tried to sell expansion cards online?

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They tried to take the whole thing online?

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I still don't remember that.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't remember.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's see.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
SSJ100 Matt says, I remember the old Crash commercials where he would always cause trouble outside of Nintendo.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I remember that as well.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's pretty cool.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's see.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Also, RK1hexAugust31st wants to know, what about the part where you call out the noobs?

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, all right.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We can do that.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The noobs in chat tonight.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Of course, again, I'm going off memory.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Dark Soccer, you may have to help me if you don't recognize any of these names.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think, well, first off, that name I just named is new.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
RK1hexAugust31.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's see.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Broodwitch I think is new.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Alistar I recognize from our World of Warcraft guild.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hello.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's see.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Who else is new?

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't know if I recognize any other new names.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Jodrew?

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Have we had that before?

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I might be new too.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So there you have it.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hello, noobs.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Everybody who's new.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The ones that I neglected to name and the ones that I may have named twice.

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There you go.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hi, monsters.

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
All right.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Wait.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Anyhow.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I just had it in my head because I just typed die, monster.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I meant hi, noobs.

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
All right.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Is there a Castlevania chat going on?

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Someone said Rondo of Blood sucks, so I kicked whoever that was.

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
All right.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're a big fan of Castlevania, obviously.

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Symphony of the Night included.

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No.

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I like Metroid.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Look, I know you're really, well, then you should really like Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I know.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Because it ripped off Metroid in many ways, but that's what made it so great.

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm going to kick DM in too, just because.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay, do it.

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What was I going to say?

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Rondo of Blood you love, but Symphony of the Night was kind of in some ways a sequel to Rondo of Blood.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You love Symphony of the Night a lot, right?

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, that was a sequel to Rondo of Blood.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Right.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Are you going to play it on Xbox Live Arcade, or are you going to say, eh, why should I download this?

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I already have the PlayStation and Saturn and whatever else.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Saturn and I don't really have a need to, because I do have the other versions, so.

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Although, to this one's credit, it'll be, you know.

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If it's the Saturn version, hell yeah.

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No, it won't be.

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Then no.

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It'll be enabled for your HDTV, granted it's got the stupid stagnant graphics on the side, but at least you won't have to worry about altering your TV settings or any of that stuff.

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You can get messages from a lot of our listeners while you play.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then no.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
When I was playing DDR Universe this week, I got like 50.

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't want messages arriving while I'm in the middle of the game.

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You don't have to answer them.

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't like seeing little things pop up on the middle of the game.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can also ignore them.

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You can turn that off.

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm lazy.

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I've been playing my PS3 today.

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, that's your fault.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
All right, well then let's get into how was your gaming week, because we always start off with a show with how was your gaming week.

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So what have you been playing this week, Dark Sakura?

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance today on PS3, which was really, really good.

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And we just got a new pinball machine.

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I've got a bride of Pinbot now.

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We're working on fixing it up, and that's really it.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I thought you said you played Marvel this week.

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's what I just said.

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance today.

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, tell me more about it.

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What's the game like?

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It actually is a really good game.

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's surprising, although the PS3 version, it obviously is just a port, because nothing is pretty or super.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Well, I mean, it's really pretty.

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The gameplay itself, but the cinemas are not touched up for it.

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But the only complaint I really have with that game is the camera sometimes getting a little bit weird,

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and the bosses in the Atlantis level right now.

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But it was really cool, because, like, dude, what the hell is Mysterio doing here?

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And, like, I've determined that playing as Elektra sucks, but playing as Captain America is fucking awesome,

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
because he throws the shield and it bounces off the walls while you beat other stuff up,

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and then, like, right when they're about to hit you, it bounces them in the head.

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I seem to remember it was kind of that way in an old arcade game.

203
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Didn't they have an old arcade Marvel game that you could play that was very similar?

204
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, there was the Avengers game that was, you know, just one of those little side-scrolling basher things.

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I seem to remember a shield kind of did the same thing, where it bounced around.

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Dude, Captain America is awesome.

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's cool.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I have a mild obsession with Captain America right now.

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And yes, as a SH-100, Matt and his Marvel does rock,

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
except I've decided that who rocks more than she does in that game is Spider-Woman.

211
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
For those that maybe don't follow comic books as heavily as you do,

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
because I know you're a bit of a comic fangirl,

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
but maybe, you know, I like the X-Men movie, I like the cartoons,

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I know I'm somewhat familiar with the Marvel universe, but I don't really follow it.

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So would there be anything for me in this game, or would I not appreciate it because I don't really follow Marvel?

216
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't think you have to really follow it.

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I mean, there's so much fun fan stuff thrown in that I think it's really great,

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
but I don't think you really need to be a big fan of, you know, Marvel comics to get into the game.

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It does follow the established Marvel universe, although for some weird reason.

220
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Like, a couple of the characters are in their Ultimate costumes,

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
but, like, I quickly went and changed all of them back to their regular universe ones,

222
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
but it was pretty cool.

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That has Nick Fury in it, and he's awesome.

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But not like the Ultimate version, where he's like Sammy L. Pimp, you know, Nick Fury,

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
it's like old-school eyepatch Nick Fury, which makes me happy.

226
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And no, wait, I cannot believe you're betraying me like this.

227
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's our friend Brad from Pod Culture.

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No, I don't like DC Comics.

229
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Except for I like Birds of Prey, because it's very, you know, ambiguously lesbian-ish.

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Wait, DC Comics is...

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Superman.

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Batman, too, right?

233
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And Batman.

234
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I love the X-Men, and I love the Avengers, except for Iron Man, because he's an asshole right now.

235
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But I really like Captain America.

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
All right, let's see, I'm looking at the chat room to see some other comics here.

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Some folks in there are explaining their gaming week.

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Of course, I see Brad saying the DC universe beats Marvel every day.

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Uh-oh.

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What else is there?

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Sounds like a lot of people playing Crackdown this week.

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Somebody had said, I was looking, there it is.

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Tiger Claw says, I remember the X-Men arcade game with the widescreen and the four players.

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And that was the game that first came into my mind.

245
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Although, obviously, Captain America wasn't in that game,

246
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
but I also remember that game very well from the arcades.

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Like, it was one of those things where they put two TVs together to make the screen,

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and it had the big line going down the middle because it was two monitors next to each other.

249
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But that game was fun.

250
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And it wasn't just four, couldn't you play that with six people?

251
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I seem to remember, like, there was a mondo-sized version.

252
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Six or eight.

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The Golf Land had a one-point. You could play, like, six people.

254
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Of course, if you were player one or player six, it sucked to be you,

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
because you were, like, standing on the side.

256
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You could kind of only half see the screen.

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Because they have, like, three monitors or whatever, and it's kind of wrapped around.

258
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah, that was a funny game.

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's like, I walked off the screen. Aw.

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
All right, I'm assuming Dark Soccer has done, so, Loki, how was your gaming week?

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It was fun.

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I played Crackdown a lot.

263
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I actually finished the game, but I'm getting those last few achievements.

264
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Like, I have everything maxed out except for firearms now, so I just have to max that out.

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm already at level four on it, but just, you know, almost there.

266
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And then I have to get the rest of the orbs and the hidden orbs and all that stuff.

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So I'm just working on the last few achievements, but I'm done with the game, so, yay.

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And then, what else?

269
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, I played DDR Universe, and that was okay.

270
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's good for DDR, I guess, but I got really uninterested, you know, after a while.

271
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It took forever to unlock stuff, and it's kind of just, eh, don't care.

272
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I really hate Quest Mode. I think it's retarded.

273
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And, yeah, the Challenge Mode is kind of cool.

274
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I really wish it was stuck with, like, the Interstellar Mode or whatever they had before in, like, Extreme 2 and stuff.

275
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That was, Stellar Master Mode. That was a lot better than this crappy-ass Quest Mode.

276
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It just has not gotten any better.

277
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Bullet Witch. I played Bullet Witch a little bit, and everything bad that you've heard about that game is true.

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It sucks balls.

279
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's really that bad. What exactly do you do in Bullet Witch? I've seen it, but I don't know much about it.

280
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Bullet Witch, you just go around killing things, but the thing that sucks about it...

281
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I like murder.

282
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay, well, murder is good, but the game itself, there's no lock-on for anything, and the enemies are really fucking easy.

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But then again, like I said, to be fair, I've only played it for a short amount of time, so I haven't really given it a fair shake yet,

284
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
but from what I've seen so far, it doesn't look good.

285
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It looks like a game that was, like, first-gen PlayStation 2 or something, just really old.

286
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I don't know. It just didn't feel very cool or anything, but, you know, whatever.

287
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So I gave it a shot, and then I played the Armored Core 4 demo that's out in Japan right now,

288
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and that one is awesome, and I can't wait to pick up the full game.

289
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's a lot faster than ChromeHounds.

290
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you were turned off by ChromeHounds, this might be the game for you, because it's a lot faster.

291
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I mean, there's three fucking buttons for, you know, boost in the game, so, I mean, you gotta love that.

292
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And it's just pretty cool. I like it.

293
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Although it was in Japanese, so I didn't really know what they wanted me to do, but it was fun blowing up things.

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So I'm really looking forward to that, and I think that's pretty much all I played this week.

295
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah, lots of Crackdown, though. I really need to play some co-op so I can get that last co-op achievement.

296
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But, oh, there's some fun things to do in Crackdown. We were messing around with stuff.

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Driving the semi-truck around and just boosting through pedestrians like crazy was fun.

298
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Killing hundreds and hundreds of people.

299
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And you can actually level up your driving pretty fast that way, because you end up killing more bad guys than you do the actual pedestrians.

300
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't know. It was fun.

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Alright. I also played a little bit of Crackdown this week, but not enough to really review the game.

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And it's odd, because I don't really get into those types of games like Crackdown or Grand Theft Auto.

303
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I mean, they're kind of fun for five minutes, but when I try to play the story mode, I don't really get into them as much.

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So I can't really give the game a fair review yet, but I'm going to force myself to play a little more and try to look at it a little more from the perspective of,

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
well, okay, I realize I'm not a fan of this genre, but what my fans of the genre think of it.

306
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But I'm more excited about getting to play the Halo 3 beta, finally, after all.

307
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So I'm looking forward to that as part of Crackdown.

308
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Also, games I did play a little more that I did get into this week. Missed Online, I finally checked out, which obviously existed a few years ago,

309
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
but kind of got the plug pulled on it before it really had a chance to be a flourished game.

310
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So GameTap gave this thing CPR recently, and now it's up and running as of, I think, Valentine's Day or the day after is when they actually launched this.

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So I went on there to check it out, very much unlike any other MMO you've ever played.

312
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
In fact, I don't even know if it would be fair to call this game an MMO,

313
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
because if you think this is going to be like a Warcraft-y run quest, slash things, kill things, that's totally not like that.

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You've got to remember, Missed was not like that. Missed was what?

315
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It was a puzzle game where you didn't really know what the hell was going on.

316
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You just knew you had to do things to unlock the way, and as you explored, you figured out more of the story.

317
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So that's exactly what Missed Online is. It's a game of exploration with other people.

318
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's kind of weird at first because my brain wasn't really thinking that was what I was getting into,

319
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
although I should have known better because I played Missed back in the day.

320
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But I'm thinking, oh, it's an MMO. We're going to go around and kill things.

321
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No, no, no, no, no. It's nothing like that.

322
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So the game itself controls a little weird and is a little jumpy.

323
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't know if I dug the control scheme, but it's very simple.

324
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's a very easy game to kind of jump into.

325
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Things I liked about the game.

326
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I think the game is relatively good looking, especially when you consider the game is a couple years old.

327
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I think the game also, as I said, is easy to really pick up and go.

328
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I think it's got a very interesting story, and I really like the ambiance

329
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
because in many ways it felt like it was Silent Hill just with no zombies.

330
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
There was a part that actually scared me is that I was walking onto a bridge,

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and suddenly the bridge collapsed, and I was like, ah!

332
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But that just kind of shows how you can really get sucked into this game

333
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
because the acronym URU also stands for U-R-U.

334
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So you're supposed to kind of envision that it's actually you in the world.

335
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So the music and everything kind of adds this ambiance to it that I really liked.

336
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Things I didn't like about the game.

337
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Download times are atrocious.

338
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I mean, having to patch the game earlier in the week,

339
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
there was no percentage bar or anything that showed me how long it was.

340
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I swear the game took like an hour to patch.

341
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Additionally, when you try to access new areas in game,

342
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
it takes a long time to load up the new areas of the game

343
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
because sometimes it's like you're downloading them before you even go there.

344
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I understand it's trying to download the world on my computer,

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
but I kind of wish there was a little more forewarning or something.

346
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I literally had to wait 30 minutes for some new area to download,

347
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and I just bounced from spending only five minutes in another place.

348
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I was just kind of exploring, walking around, and then suddenly, bam,

349
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I got to wait 30 minutes with no real warning.

350
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So the load times in the game I was not a fan of.

351
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I do think, though, back to the positives,

352
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I think if you're the type of person to get sucked into those reality gaming things,

353
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
what do they call those things?

354
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Like the Loki or the alternate universe games?

355
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
ARGs? What is that?

356
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Alternate reality gaming ARGs.

357
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What are some of the popular ones?

358
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't remember.

359
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
They have one right now for...

360
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's not really an alternate reality game.

361
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I guess it's more of a viral site or something,

362
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
but sort of is.

363
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What was it?

364
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
premiumtechpaper.com or something like that?

365
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Okay, well, Myst is kind of something like that,

366
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
but it takes you to the next level.

367
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Actually, that might be more of a viral site.

368
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Myst Online really takes us to the next level,

369
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
because there are sites that are supposedly made by people in the cavern.

370
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I think if you're into role-playing a little bit, you'd really be into it,

371
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
because there's people that play IC in cavern.

372
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They pretend that they really are in the cavern,

373
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
and they really are exploring these worlds and talk with that perspective.

374
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
There's people that play OOC at a cavern and talk like it's normal.

375
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The Myst Online guides give you this general overview of what to expect.

376
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I think it's really cool that GameTap is really pouring their heart and soul into this game.

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm very encouraged to see what kind of next MMO they jump onto next,

378
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
because it's obviously putting a lot of effort into Myst.

379
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh, one other thing I should say about Myst.

380
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
There are live people that interact with the game as well,

381
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and continue to develop the story.

382
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Essentially, the players can change the story by interacting with the real-life actors.

383
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
They do this orientation every hour, Monday through Friday, from 5 to 10.

384
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
They do orientations every hour.

385
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I actually went to one, and there was actually a guy there

386
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
that talked about what the universe was.

387
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
To make sure it wasn't a robot, I threw out a question, and he actually answered it.

388
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He said there were live people just talking about the game,

389
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and took you on a tour of the main area.

390
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
If you're really into those alternate reality things, you're going to get a kick out of it.

391
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But if you want a game where you quest that has an objective,

392
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
that has set goals and things you do,

393
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Myst Online isn't going to be really feeling it for you.

394
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It doesn't seem like you really interact with people a lot in the beginning.

395
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I think that's something you work towards.

396
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
If you're a GameTap subscriber, obviously you're already paying for Myst Online,

397
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
so go in there and look at it.

398
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's worth it.

399
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
If you're not already a subscriber of GameTap, is it worth it just for Myst Online?

400
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm not sure.

401
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You really need to check out the demo so you can see for yourself what I'm talking about,

402
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
that it's not your typical type of MMO, and make your decision from there.

403
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I still recommend GameTap as a whole, because 800-something games for $9.95 a month.

404
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I think it's a great service.

405
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Sometimes I talk about it so well on the show, you'd think I'm on their payroll,

406
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
but I'm not.

407
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I think it's a really great service.

408
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
If you're a GameTap subscriber, go check it out.

409
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
If you're out of the country where you don't get GameTap

410
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
and you're going to have to buy this game separately,

411
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
definitely download the demo first, because again, it's Myst, not World of Warcraft,

412
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
not Final Fantasy, any of that stuff.

413
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Also, I checked out DDR Universe for the Xbox 360.

414
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
There's a lot of very good things about Universe.

415
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
There's a lot of very bad things about Universe.

416
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Dance House Revolution Universe, the good things, song list, great.

417
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I love the song list.

418
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Graphics, pretty cool, a little bit vibrant.

419
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I had to turn them down because they were a little too colorful,

420
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
but the videos are very well done.

421
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They're vibrant.

422
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Obviously, the game is in HD, which gives the game a whole new look.

423
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's very cool.

424
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Things I didn't like, quest mode, quest mode, quest mode.

425
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That mode is atrocious.

426
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's the worst thing that ever happened to DDR since True Kiss Destination.

427
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Seriously, it's awful.

428
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It is so awful. I can't even explain it.

429
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
There's no questing to it.

430
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's like you go to a city and you fucking,

431
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
we need to get some fame, play songs over and over and over.

432
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
There's no explanation.

433
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's poorly done.

434
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's basically the same five challenges over and over,

435
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and they have to unlock things through this mode as a joke.

436
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So if you're thinking that,

437
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
oh, I'm going to get a thousand easy points from DDR Universe,

438
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
no, you'll get about 400 from playing just play each song once.

439
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But quest mode, it's not even worth it.

440
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Seriously, wait and see if an unlock code is released.

441
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Like remember Ultramix 2,

442
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
like an unlock code came out later that would give you all the unlocks?

443
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Just wait for that.

444
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
See if something happens.

445
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't know if there is one or not,

446
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
but hopefully there is because quest mode sucks.

447
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's just not even worth it.

448
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So in other words,

449
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
if you are buying this game as a single player

450
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
who likes all that extra stuff inside DDR,

451
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
the game itself is really solid,

452
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
like the songs and the steps and everything,

453
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
but if you're buying this for quest mode or Xbox Live,

454
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
which basically has all the modes we've seen before,

455
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't think there's really a whole lot else extra.

456
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Let me put it this way.

457
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
If you're contemplating upgrading to Xbox 360 just for DDR, don't.

458
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But if you are a 360 owner,

459
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
DDR is a very unique game,

460
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
and I think it's something you should check out.

461
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And they made it very beginner friendly, which I think is cool.

462
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And other good things I should say about it real quick,

463
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
other good things is that, again, it's very beginner friendly.

464
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It does have the jukebox mode and the edit step and video mode,

465
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
which is kind of neat.

466
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And again, the song list is great.

467
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The downloads are pretty cool.

468
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yes, they're already on the disc,

469
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
but honestly, some of the Ultra Mixes were done the same way.

470
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's something extra.

471
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's not essential to the gameplay.

472
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And the basic game itself is fine.

473
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
But again, some of those other things,

474
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
like just the fact that the frame rate is still a little buggy,

475
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I swear to God,

476
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Cowboy Emi has her head on backwards when you play on certain songs.

477
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Check it out for yourself. I'm not joking.

478
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
For a DDR hardcore fan,

479
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
there's going to be some things in here that really irk you.

480
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Here's my thing that pissed me off,

481
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and I don't know if you noticed it.

482
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Did you have trouble playing on a controller with the game?

483
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Because I had steps.

484
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I know I hit it on time,

485
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
and it gave me a good, or it gave me a complete miss.

486
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And I'm just like, what the fuck?

487
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And I think it was either lag or there was just some sort of frame rate problem.

488
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Turn off the videos and dancers and see if you get the same thing.

489
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I turned off the videos.

490
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It was a little bit better.

491
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But here's the thing, though.

492
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You need the videos to be on in order to play Quest Mode

493
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
because you get special points if you buy the background videos in the game,

494
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
which is stupid.

495
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I don't know.

496
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
All right.

497
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So, you know, I don't know.

498
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Again, I do think DDR Universe is a good DDR game

499
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
because essentially what does DDR end up being?

500
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It's all about the songs and the steps,

501
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
and DDR delivers on some awesome songs and great steps.

502
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But the other stuff kind of built around it, not so great.

503
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And I really hope they patch it up with Universe 2.

504
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And I was very disappointed to see some of those like frame rate things

505
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
and just that Quest Mode is so god awful

506
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
when the PlayStation 2 mixes had perfectly fine extra modes in them

507
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
that should have been brought over to the 360

508
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
or, you know, let the PlayStation 2 people come up with your modes

509
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
because Quest Mode is horrible.

510
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's horrid.

511
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So that's it.

512
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Okay.

513
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So, LankyStyle, I noticed you just joined us.

514
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Do you want to be on the radio tonight?

515
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
No.

516
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Okay.

517
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Well, tell us about your gaming week anyway because you're here

518
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
with your freshly shaved head, I notice.

519
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh, yeah.

520
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What's that about?

521
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I just...

522
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Britney Spears.

523
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, I was going to say Britney Spears.

524
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Britney Spears did it, and I love her.

525
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I want to do the spider with her.

526
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
All right.

527
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Anyhow, let's not explain what that is.

528
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
How was your gaming week?

529
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Pretty good.

530
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I've been playing Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy VI for the GBA

531
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
and just dual wielding the Final Fantasies because that's what I do.

532
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And good times.

533
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Don't have any of the new systems because I'm old school.

534
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But I did play DR Universe, which is pretty cool.

535
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I like the license tracks on it,

536
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
but the old school tracks that they pulled back,

537
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
that they brought back, I don't know.

538
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I don't think it was the best selection.

539
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Well, they've kind of already pulled a lot back in the other Xbox games, right?

540
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yeah.

541
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So they kind of, you know, they didn't want to repeat, so...

542
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
That's true.

543
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I know it's kind of cool they got Hot Limit back.

544
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Eh, gay.

545
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
All right.

546
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Let's see.

547
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Going to the chat.

548
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm trying to see what's being talked about previously there.

549
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Most people are kind of taken back by the True Kiss destination reference,

550
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
or True Kiss TKD reference I made earlier in the show.

551
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And then somebody had to explain the DDR games that only came out in Japan.

552
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Let's see.

553
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Let's say there's controversy brewing over Rondo of Blood in chat.

554
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
All right.

555
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Let's see.

556
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Fireball wants to know why do I keep hearing aim noises in the background

557
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
because Jamie's chatting while the show's going on.

558
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You got busted.

559
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I always have it open just like for only one person who is listening to the show,

560
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
by the way, so I can keep in touch with Tiara.

561
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Gotcha.

562
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
All righty.

563
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Well, now that we've gone over all our gaming weeks,

564
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
we're going to start getting into some gaming news.

565
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But first, some housekeeping.

566
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Housekeeping this week.

567
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
First off, we want to say a big thank you and hug, hug, kiss, kiss

568
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
to PSP Fanboy who profiled us on their site this week.

569
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
They, you know, posted like,

570
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
hey, this is a cool show that you should download.

571
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I think it's called RSS This, so they didn't have to do that,

572
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
so that was very nice, and we had no idea it was coming.

573
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
What's kind of funny about it, Jamie,

574
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm not sure if you're aware what happened,

575
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
but when they originally posted the review,

576
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
they said something about it's really refreshing to have gay commentators

577
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
on the show because Sky is gay and Dark Sakura is a lesbian,

578
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
and that made me go I have a bad feeling this guy listened to the episode

579
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
where if you go back a couple episodes,

580
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Dark Sakura and Chris were making those jokes back at each other

581
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
where Dark Sakura and Chris were joking

582
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
that they were going to go off and have sex.

583
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So that made me kind of laugh.

584
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So I replied, and I was like, actually, she's married.

585
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You may not have caught that.

586
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You may have downloaded the show where she was flirting with the lesbians,

587
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
but she's just a cool girl who doesn't really, you know, sexualities, whatever.

588
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So there you go.

589
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So they corrected the thing, but they still like the show.

590
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I like boobs.

591
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I know. You're cool. Whatever.

592
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Oh, my God.

593
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I think what it boils down to, it's not that you're necessarily straight

594
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
or you're a lesbian. You're just a slut.

595
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
No, I'm not.

596
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm just kidding. You're not.

597
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I've only slept with one person ever.

598
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I know.

599
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm saying this right now.

600
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm in a monogamous relationship with my very first and only, so ha.

601
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
And you still can look at boobs.

602
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

603
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Because boobs are hot and squishy.

604
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Very cool.

605
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
All right.

606
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Also, a couple other quick housekeeping things.

607
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I want to point out over on Orangeloungeradio.com in our forums,

608
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
we've opened up our feedback threads a little early now.

609
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
So that way, those of you guys that are listening live,

610
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
A, if you're too chicken to join the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com,

611
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
you can post in our forum your live feedback as the show is going.

612
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And also, it's a good way for folks that are listening live

613
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
if they're in a chat room,

614
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
like if they had a favorite topic or quote

615
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
or some funny moment that they wanted to document,

616
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
that can go in the thread.

617
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And that's really good in helping us to write our synopsis,

618
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
what you guys liked,

619
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
because then we kind of know what to feature in the show

620
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
because you guys say you liked it.

621
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So just a little thing there.

622
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Also, we want to mention this.

623
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
This doesn't directly have to do with us,

624
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
but we're kind of throwing our support behind it, shall we say.

625
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Obviously, if you didn't already know,

626
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Orange Lounge Radio is rebroadcast on a network called All Games,

627
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
available at allgames.com,

628
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
and we rebroadcast there in full parts A and B

629
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Monday night at 5.30 Pacific time

630
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m. Pacific time.

631
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And it's us syndicated on there,

632
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
as well as a bunch of other podcasts you may have heard of,

633
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Evil Avatar, Chatterbox, Video Game Outsiders,

634
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Game Attic Hotline, just to name a few.

635
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
There's a lot of good shows that are syndicated on there.

636
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
All Games is trying to build this community-type thing.

637
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's kind of like Myspace, but without the suck,

638
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
because Myspace, as nice as it is,

639
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and you get a lot of attention there and everything,

640
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
the problem with Myspace is that I don't know about you guys,

641
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
but I'm getting all these cam girls and sluts

642
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and hey, cam guys and everything that are trying to add me on there,

643
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
and you have to filter out all this spam and crap

644
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
to get through Myspace.

645
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So I guess All Games found this other service called Ning

646
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
that allows you to create your own social network

647
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
without all the frickin' ads and all that stuff.

648
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And that's pretty cool.

649
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You can have your own blog on there and talk about stuff,

650
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and then the blogs go to the front page,

651
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
and you can add your own videos and all that stuff.

652
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
So it's pretty cool.

653
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I think we've all made profiles on there.

654
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I know Dr. Sakura did. I did.

655
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Loki, you're making one or will be making one.

656
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Haven't made one yet, but yeah.

657
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Would you? Okay.

658
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So if you want to check that out, it's community.allgames.com.

659
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And granted, we could have used Ning to make our own page,

660
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
our own social network, the Orange Lounge social network,

661
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
but we kind of didn't see the point

662
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
because we're all about indie podcasting,

663
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and we know the reality is we're probably not the only game podcast you listen to.

664
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And also, if you're an All Games listener,

665
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
most of the other podcasts you listen to are probably on All Games.

666
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So why don't we all band together and contribute to this one network

667
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
as opposed to having ten little ones?

668
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So there you have it.

669
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I actually posted a blog post there today,

670
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
so go check it out and comment on it and tell me what you thought.

671
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
See? Isn't that cool?

672
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
All right. I think that's it for housekeeping.

673
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So we will get into some game news now.

674
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Who's starting us off tonight?

675
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I do believe that would be me.

676
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Congratulations.

677
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Well, for all five of us who have PlayStation 3s,

678
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
we have something to look forward to.

679
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
The firmware is being updated to 1.54

680
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
that will add video chat features so that we can, I guess,

681
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
watch naked people and sweaty fanboys on the other side.

682
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
But if it's our screen format, hey, that'd be great.

683
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And if you've also...

684
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
This, of course, is more going to go toward any of the UK listeners,

685
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
but if you've imported your PS3,

686
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
you'd go into the system menu and update via the Internet,

687
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
or you can download the firmware from the U.S. or Japanese support sites.

688
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
We actually have to pay 20 bucks for it.

689
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I'm sorry, 20 bucks for Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.

690
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Over in the UK, that would be $6.99.

691
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And that's really the only differences I'm seeing coming up with that.

692
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I didn't download that either.

693
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I was like, eh, no.

694
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Twenty-some dollars is too much for me to pay for a game.

695
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
That you download.

696
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I was going to say, you paid like 60 bucks for...

697
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yeah, but there's a big difference between Tekken and Dig Dug.

698
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'm also not a Tekken fan.

699
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm not really a fighting game fan either.

700
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't think Tekken is worth $600,

701
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
which is essentially what you're going to try to sell me on,

702
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
because I still don't have a PlayStation 3.

703
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And Flow, I still haven't gotten Flow.

704
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It's like, I have trouble paying $8.

705
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You mean After Dark, the game?

706
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Yeah, exactly.

707
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
They should have put toasters in there.

708
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
That would be even better.

709
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
That would be fun.

710
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
If you didn't listen to last week's show, by the way,

711
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
we did tell Sony exactly how to win the next gen war race.

712
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And I'm thinking, even though we said this should be a retail game,

713
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
it may work if they put it on Xbox Live Marketplace.

714
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And once again, that is Laser Cats the game.

715
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
If they can obtain the license to Laser Cats and get the exclusive

716
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and put it on Xbox Live Market, or, whoops.

717
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
PlayStation Network.

718
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
See?

719
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
See where my mind goes?

720
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I don't even realize there's a PlayStation Network,

721
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
so I'll have Laser Cats 3.

722
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Well, if Xbox beats them to it, that's the nail in Sony's coffin.

723
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So there you go.

724
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's a race now.

725
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
This is the real next gen wars.

726
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Who will obtain Laser Cats the game,

727
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
because that will be the victor of the next gen war.

728
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Now, not necessarily adding lasers to cats is a good idea.

729
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I mean, for example, there was a game called Laser Dolphin

730
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
that came out that was basically a rip-off of Echo the Dolphin.

731
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I think it might have even been made by the same people.

732
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
And, yeah, it sucked.

733
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
They basically added weapons to a bunch of the sea life,

734
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and it wasn't very fun.

735
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
But they had dolphins with freaking laser on their heads.

736
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So, I don't know.

737
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's a start.

738
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
It's a start.

739
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Another start would be the future updates

740
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
getting some upscaling for your DVDs.

741
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Now, this is, I think, a feature that's already on the Xbox 360,

742
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
and it's already on Blu-Ray players out there,

743
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
at least some of the Sony ones

744
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
and I think some of the other ones out there.

745
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But that's something that's going to be coming later on.

746
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Of course, normal DVDs upscaled look pretty good.

747
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Not exactly going to be as great as content that was made for that resolution.

748
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But, hey, something's better than nothing.

749
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I'd rather have my DVDs look a little bit better.

750
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
So, hooray!

751
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Something that's in the update other than video chat,

752
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
because guess what?

753
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I don't have any friends on the PlayStation Network,

754
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
so video chat's kind of useless to me.

755
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
You have no friends on the PlayStation Network?

756
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah, I have Bobby on there, and that's about it.

757
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That is the only friend on my friends list.

758
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Aw, Bobby's your only friend?

759
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And I don't even play online, really, with the PS3.

760
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I've never played Resistance online,

761
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
which I really need to do because it's supposed to be pretty good.

762
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And then Motorstorm, which this week we're going to have that,

763
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
and maybe I'll play that online,

764
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
but Motorstorm is not two-player split-screen.

765
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That fucking sucks.

766
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Why the hell can't they do split-screen games anymore?

767
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Is it just too graphic-intensive?

768
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Because you're essentially having to render the two things at once.

769
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Well, I would think that the cell processor could handle that.

770
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I don't know.

771
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I mean, shit, it should be able to reconstruct my DNA.

772
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I mean, the cell is awesome, right?

773
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Anyways, so upscaling DVDs,

774
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I think the cell processor should be able to do that, hopefully.

775
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
All right, let's see, going on to the chat room

776
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and kind of looking at what's going on in chat.

777
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Let's see, the Rob D. was correcting me from earlier

778
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and said it's actually not $600.

779
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
It's $599 U.S. dollars.

780
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Oh, sorry, but you forgot tax and all that other crap they throw in there.

781
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
$599, 99.

782
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah.

783
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Let's see, Holy Shonen says,

784
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Aw, poor Loki, Bobby, his only friend.

785
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And Rama says, Loki is the Charlie Brown of Orange Lounge Radio.

786
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Did you want to give out your username

787
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
so that other listeners can take pity on you

788
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
and you can have more than one friend?

789
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It's just Loki space O-L-R.

790
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Oh, there you go.

791
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
All right.

792
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't think it's just no one has PlayStation 3s.

793
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I have one.

794
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Wait, why aren't you guys friends?

795
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Because you don't like Loki?

796
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Because she doesn't play her PlayStation 3.

797
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yes, I do.

798
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I played it all day today.

799
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I sold one of my PlayStation 3 games.

800
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I sold Full Auto 2 finally.

801
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm still keeping Ridge Racer 7 just for the fuck of it.

802
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Because it's Ridge Racer.

803
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Exactly.

804
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's Ridge Racer 6 and new packaging for the PlayStation 3.

805
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Fucking 8.

806
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm not buying Ridge Racer 8.

807
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Hear me now, Namco.

808
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You need to change more than just...

809
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Look, the cars are a little bit more shiny.

810
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And the tracks are a little bit more shiny.

811
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
What if Ridge Racer 8 allowed you to select

812
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Toons is the driving cat as a driver?

813
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Would you then buy Ridge Racer 8?

814
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
No, I wouldn't.

815
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Although, if Ridge Racer 8 had tons of sluts everywhere,

816
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
then maybe.

817
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That's what they need.

818
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You know, the one cover chick is cool,

819
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
but you need lots of sluts.

820
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You need this to be like an import magazine.

821
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You know, fucking tuner shit.

822
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Where you have hot Asian busty models everywhere.

823
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
This is what will sell Ridge Racer for you.

824
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Why are you rolling your eyes, Jamie?

825
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You just said five minutes ago you like boobs.

826
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I wasn't rolling my eyes.

827
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I was popping my neck.

828
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Oh.

829
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm telling you, this is what they need.

830
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Because Ridge Racer doesn't really stand out.

831
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And you know what?

832
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Need for speed and fucking juiced and stuff

833
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
are kind of getting a little bit better.

834
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
But seriously, more women could never hurt.

835
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Well, I don't know if there'd be anything in that for me.

836
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Who cares?

837
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
You don't play Ridge Racer.

838
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I do too.

839
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I played Ridge Racer 6.

840
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Then you'll like it with the women.

841
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Fine.

842
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I do like boobs.

843
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's fun.

844
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Like she said, they're squishy.

845
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
They put it this way.

846
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
They make good pillows.

847
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Well, if you like Ridge Racer as it is now,

848
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
then it won't matter.

849
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Because they'll still be the same.

850
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It'll just have extra women in there.

851
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
If the women aren't for you, then there you go.

852
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You've still got Ridge Racer.

853
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Let's see.

854
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Fireboma says Ridge Racer 8.

855
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Sluts everywhere.

856
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Alpha Canogram gives the mandatory LOL sluts.

857
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
GS68 says Ridge Racer Xtreme Beach Volleyball.

858
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
There you go.

859
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And Bobby Black Wolf just joined chat going,

860
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
did someone say my name?

861
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
To which Rob D promptly responded,

862
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
it's Loki's only friend, Black Wolf.

863
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Are you going to put the patent down on this Ridge Racer?

864
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Ridge Racer 8.

865
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
No, because they'll never do it.

866
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I mean, they're still making weird.

867
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
They still think that fucking Peanuts is a valuable franchise to them.

868
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I mean, come on.

869
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
All right.

870
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Actually, I wanted to pull up here.

871
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I actually have.

872
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I overheard Black Wolf and Loki talking earlier,

873
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and I actually found the theme song of their relationship.

874
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So here it is.

875
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm your only friend.

876
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'm not your only friend.

877
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But I'm a little blowing friend.

878
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But really, I'm not actually your friend.

879
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But I am.

880
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Haven't you ever heard this song in your life?

881
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Never mind.

882
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
OK.

883
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Joke gone wrong.

884
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Also, something that went way wrong earlier this week

885
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
was the relationship between Kotaku and Sony.

886
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Surely, if you've been anywhere on the internet this week on game blogs,

887
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
you've heard about this whole fiasco.

888
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Basically, Kotaku published this rumor,

889
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
and the rumor is that PlayStation is going to be unveiling

890
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
the PlayStation Home at Game Developers Conference.

891
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Quote, basically, you get to make an avatar for your console, like a me,

892
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and this avatar has a room.

893
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
As you play games and accomplish certain tasks,

894
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
you will receive items with which to adorn the room

895
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
that are specific to the game, achievements.

896
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The kicker is that this is going to be a new requirement

897
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
for every PlayStation 3 game.

898
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Awesome.

899
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
PlayStation is doing something right.

900
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
They are ripping off some of the best parts of Nintendo and Microsoft,

901
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
which is what they need to do.

902
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That's fine.

903
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Everybody rips each other off.

904
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
They're ripping off the Wii and Animal Crossing from Nintendo.

905
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
They're ripping off the achievements from Xbox 360

906
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
and making a more dynamic online service to compete with them.

907
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Great.

908
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
This sounds like a wonderful thing.

909
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Certainly, this couldn't be bad press.

910
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
This is good news for Sony for once.

911
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And what does Sony do?

912
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
They fuck it up with bad press because suddenly,

913
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
like not even five minutes after this rumor goes up,

914
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Kotaku gets this huge Yudon fucked up letter from Sony.

915
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I don't have the letter in front of me,

916
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
but essentially it said you're a bad person for running that story.

917
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Therefore, you're uninvited from our press conferences.

918
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
We want you to send the dev kit back.

919
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
We're slapping you on the wrist, blah, blah, blah.

920
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It is the equivalent of playing Monopoly with somebody who's losing,

921
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
and they throw the board up in the air and say,

922
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Fuck this game.

923
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm taking my board home.

924
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
That's basically what happened, yes?

925
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Fair to say?

926
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, and they're worried about negative press from the story.

927
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So this catches wildfire because everybody's like,

928
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
What the hell did Kotaku do wrong?

929
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Not only did they pretty much prove this rumor to be true,

930
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I mean, come on.

931
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Is there any way this rumor could not be true?

932
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Well, that and the fact that they've also registered trademarks

933
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
for PlayStation Home.

934
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
That came out later.

935
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
You're jumping in later.

936
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Sorry.

937
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
But now we all knew the damn thing was true.

938
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
What they really had to do is just...

939
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
We do not comment on rumors.

940
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
If Sony had kept their mouth shut,

941
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
they could have still had somewhat of a surprise

942
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
at Game Developers Conference.

943
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But from this happening, did they not think,

944
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Oh, well, if we're going to slap Kotaku's wrist,

945
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
don't you think they're probably going to blog about it

946
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
since obviously Sony doesn't care about him anymore?

947
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Well, here's the other thing that I think is kind of bad.

948
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Real quick, obviously the rest of the story is

949
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
the rest of the internet banded behind Kotaku.

950
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It got on Digg.

951
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Even other blogs like Destructoid

952
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
changed their title banner to basically say,

953
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Brian Crescente has the biggest balls in the world,

954
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
something like that.

955
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The entire internet is jumping behind what Kotaku did,

956
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
and Sony got its tail between its legs now,

957
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
has to go, Oh, we made a mistake.

958
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Kotaku, can we play nice again?

959
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And they made up.

960
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
They kissed and made up.

961
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Well, here's the whole thing.

962
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
The big focus wasn't about this whole story.

963
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It was that Sony was trying to dictate to a blog

964
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
what stories they could post and what they can't.

965
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
They're reporting on stuff.

966
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It's free speech.

967
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
They can do whatever the fuck they want.

968
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It's like if there's a negative story about them,

969
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
they don't want anything to do with you.

970
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
So it's kind of like they want this blog

971
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
to be in their pocket type thing.

972
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
But of course they have better journalistic integrity

973
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
than Sony had believed, so it didn't quite go their way.

974
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
They thought, Oh, big bad, Sony's going to make a huff and puff,

975
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
and they're going to just be like, Oh, okay, we'll take the story down then.

976
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Rama says, Sky, the whole Kotaku Sony thing

977
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
was a damn publicity stunt.

978
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
What do you think?

979
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
No.

980
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Where's the evidence to back that up?

981
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I don't know.

982
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's not a publicity stunt.

983
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I think it's just being stupid.

984
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Why wouldn't Sony use their own three something,

985
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
that site they have?

986
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It's called like three...

987
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I keep thinking of Frogger 2 three deep.

988
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I don't know why, but they have...

989
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Yes, please.

990
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Blog site's called Frogger 2 three.

991
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Could I have said anything more random?

992
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
They have some site, three something,

993
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
that shows how much we care.

994
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Three play.

995
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Thank you.

996
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
You knew that the whole time.

997
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You just wanted to watch me struggle.

998
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
They had three play or whatever.

999
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Couldn't they have just used that for their publicity?

1000
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Or is it because no one reads three play?

1001
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It was probably this.

1002
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It was probably that the news sounds very much like,

1003
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Mm, they're ripping off people,

1004
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
and they're probably going to go, Mm, this is our original idea.

1005
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
We were the first to ever have achievements.

1006
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I could see them saying that.

1007
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yo, Microsoft's copying us.

1008
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's just retards like that.

1009
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I can't help, I know...

1010
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I don't know.

1011
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Great, I guess, that they're doing this.

1012
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Cool.

1013
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I'm not going to buy more games, though, because of it.

1014
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm sorry.

1015
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Microsoft was smart to do the achievements,

1016
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
because I'm a sucker,

1017
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
and I buy crappy games like Bullet Witch,

1018
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
because of this shit.

1019
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And no matter how hard I try,

1020
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I can't do that, because I'm hooked, like crack.

1021
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And so, you know, the PlayStation Network or whatever,

1022
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
great, I get crap for my virtual house.

1023
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
That's awesome.

1024
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'll show it to all my friends.

1025
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Oh, wait, Bobby is my only friend on there.

1026
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So, great, that's going to be awesome.

1027
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I can't wait to show all my friend, you know.

1028
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's just stupid, though.

1029
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
That's the problem.

1030
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
They don't get it.

1031
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It's not because people are not buying a PlayStation 3

1032
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
or going on their network service,

1033
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
because there's no achievements or Miis.

1034
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
It's because it's $600, not because there's no Miis.

1035
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I didn't go, oh, wow, you know, there's Miis on here now.

1036
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I guess I'll spend $600 on a PlayStation 3.

1037
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
No, that's not the reason why people aren't buying your platform.

1038
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Jamie, you want to chime in?

1039
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I like Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

1040
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Okay, what if, let's say PlayStation puts out a patch.

1041
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
They actually do have an online version on that, by the way.

1042
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Well, let's say PlayStation comes out with a patch

1043
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
and all the old games get this too,

1044
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
because there's relatively enough games out there

1045
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
where they could go back to all the old games and patch them.

1046
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And let's say you could get a Captain America shield in your house from playing.

1047
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Would that be cool?

1048
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Yes, it would.

1049
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But is that enough to be like a real robust feature

1050
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
that could sell the PlayStation 3?

1051
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's like, hey, come over to my house.

1052
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I've got a Captain America shield.

1053
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
My answer time.

1054
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
It would be, hey, come over to my house,

1055
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I have a Captain America shield in it.

1056
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
If it were like something where the whole environment

1057
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
was very like Animal Crossing,

1058
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
where you can walk around and talk to people

1059
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
in like this big online chat room almost with avatars,

1060
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
that would be kind of cool.

1061
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Which it could be.

1062
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Keep in mind, it hasn't been officially announced yet.

1063
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
If it was browser the MMO or something,

1064
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
then that would be one.

1065
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I don't think it's enough to sell the system.

1066
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
That's exactly what I think,

1067
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
is that I don't think it's $600 cool,

1068
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
but Sony badly needs something cute like this

1069
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
to kind of help their image, if that makes any sense.

1070
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Like they really need something like this.

1071
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
But again, it boils down to the games.

1072
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Well, they need something also to flesh out their network

1073
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
because right now their network's just kind of a clusterfuck of,

1074
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I don't know what's going on, you know.

1075
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I mean, there's no downloadable content for the games.

1076
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
There's hardly any demos online.

1077
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
There's hardly any download content other than PlayStation 1 games.

1078
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Great! PlayStation 1 games.

1079
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I need a PS3 to download games to my PSP.

1080
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Which, by the way, people have broke already,

1081
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
so you can, you know, copy them and completely, you know, pirate the shit.

1082
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,000
But it's like there's no motivation for me to go online with this thing at all.

1083
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I mean, I'm sorry.

1084
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
There's just, Motorstorm's going to be a great game.

1085
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Great.

1086
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I feel like I should buy a PlayStation 3 just to be your friend

1087
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
and take pity on you.

1088
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I just, I feel so bad for you and you're my friend.

1089
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Why? I don't play my PlayStation 3.

1090
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I play my 360 and I've been playing the Wii a little bit,

1091
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
but mainly my 360.

1092
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And there was a time when I was playing Resistance,

1093
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I'm like, well, I don't know when am I going to go back and play my 360.

1094
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Well, it didn't take long to finish Resistance

1095
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
and then there's no reason to play it anymore.

1096
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
So now I'm back to playing my 360 where there's a bunch of new shit coming out,

1097
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
which is great, you know, but PlayStation 3 doesn't have anything really unique to it.

1098
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It's everything, if I'm going to get a game,

1099
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I'm going to get it on the 360 because it has achievements.

1100
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Black Wolf's getting a little territorial.

1101
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Black Wolf says, no, Sky, he's my friend.

1102
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
You stay back, bitch.

1103
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
You can add me and Dan.

1104
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
We're on there as Gunstar Hero.

1105
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Cue the scary music theme, single white female, whatever.

1106
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
All right, so definitely something that we'll continue to develop next week,

1107
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
a Game Developers Conference when they actually announced it.

1108
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Oh, wait, sorry, it's supposed to be a rumor, but come on,

1109
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
we all know it's probably true.

1110
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
It is true.

1111
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
They've already registered the fucking trademarks for it.

1112
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
They got a logo for it.

1113
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
It's coming out.

1114
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
They just didn't want it to look like this was something that they thought up real quick

1115
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
or anything like, I don't know, a six-axis controller.

1116
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
We always meant for that to have tilt control.

1117
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It wasn't like after we saw the Wii or anything that we decided to put this in here.

1118
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Could someone going to Game Developers Conference randomly shout out,

1119
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I love you Kotaku, during the Sony press conference like after or before

1120
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
when everybody's coming in?

1121
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I would do it myself, but I'm afraid of getting kicked out.

1122
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So I need someone with bigger balls.

1123
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I can't even go, so at least I didn't get invited.

1124
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
You can just go.

1125
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Is it free?

1126
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Well, if you're a press, yes.

1127
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I think you'd have to register, though.

1128
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
You can do it at the thing.

1129
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
You can't do that.

1130
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yes, you can.

1131
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Anyway, I'll talk to you offline.

1132
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
All right, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

1133
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Well, there is a little bit more from Sony.

1134
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
They have their launch lineup for the European PlayStation Network.

1135
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
There will be a few downloads available on March 23rd,

1136
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
some 5 Dark Resurrection for £6.99,

1137
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Blast Factor for £3.49,

1138
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and Gran Turismo HD Trial for free.

1139
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Other games that are set to come out are on the 30th,

1140
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Super Rub-a-Dub, which is a duct,

1141
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
6th of April, Flow, 13th April, Go Sudoku,

1142
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
and 20th April, Go Puzzle.

1143
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
So there's just a few things available for that.

1144
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Have you noticed that a lot of their games that they make

1145
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
for the online network that use 6-axis tilt controls

1146
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
are just games where it's involving you shooting something

1147
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
or something in water that you tilt the thing around.

1148
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
That is like the only thing that the 6-axis is good for

1149
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
is like fucking Etch A Sketch shit.

1150
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
For the record, I hate the 6-axis.

1151
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Actually...

1152
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I hate it.

1153
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Why?

1154
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Because you had to do shit with it on Marvel Ultimate Alliance

1155
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and it's so fucking unwieldy.

1156
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It just is an annoyance.

1157
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Actually, that would be kind of funny as an Etch A Sketch

1158
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
because you could use the analog sticks and use the dials

1159
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
and then you could shake the controller to clear it.

1160
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I don't know.

1161
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
They should make downloadable...

1162
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
But what if I had Parkinson's

1163
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and I'd never be able to draw anything?

1164
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Well...

1165
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I don't know.

1166
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Don't buy that then.

1167
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Don't buy a Wii.

1168
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Buy a 360 then.

1169
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Alright.

1170
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I will.

1171
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
The 360 will rumble for you.

1172
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Anyways, so...

1173
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Apparently, there's been some rumors going around

1174
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
that the 20 gigabyte version of the PlayStation 3

1175
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
is on its way out.

1176
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And...

1177
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Sony, of course, is saying,

1178
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
no, that's not the case.

1179
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It's just...

1180
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You know, that model, it's...

1181
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Depending up to the stores, you know,

1182
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
what they want to carry in their store,

1183
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
whether the 60 gig or 20 gig,

1184
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
and unfortunately, the 60 gigs,

1185
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
they're doing more than the 20 gigs,

1186
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
so people are bringing in less 20 gig systems

1187
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
into their stores.

1188
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Personally, though, from a distributor standpoint,

1189
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
we can't get 20 gigs anymore.

1190
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
The company we get them through won't sell them anymore.

1191
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
So...

1192
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Take that as you will.

1193
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
So, they may not be on the way out,

1194
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
but they sort of are on the way out

1195
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
because the 60 gigs they're selling in.

1196
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I heard a rumor that it might actually be cheaper

1197
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
for them to produce a 60 gig over the 20 gig,

1198
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
which that doesn't make any sense, but...

1199
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
You know, whatever.

1200
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I guess, you know, maybe they may announce something

1201
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
at Game Developers Conference, you know,

1202
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
that they're redesigning the PS3

1203
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
or something like that, so...

1204
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Now in pretty colors!

1205
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Oh, yeah.

1206
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
You know what?

1207
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That might be pretty smart to beat Nintendo

1208
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
to the market with that kind of crap.

1209
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Beat them at their own game?

1210
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Yeah, exactly.

1211
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Well, unless they come out and say,

1212
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
now in pretty colors and $200 cheaper,

1213
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I don't know if I'm sold yet.

1214
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Anyhow, something that might bring some people

1215
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
back to the PlayStation 3,

1216
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
including Hideo Kojima,

1217
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
you know, if you can think back to an old story.

1218
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I mean, yes, we all know Metal Gear Solid 4

1219
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
is coming out on 360, but...

1220
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I can't get Microsoft out of my mind tonight.

1221
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
What the fuck?

1222
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Apparently, Metal Gear Solid 4

1223
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
is coming out on PlayStation 3,

1224
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
but what did Kojima say he missed?

1225
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Rumble, right?

1226
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
And that was an essential part of Metal Gear Solid,

1227
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
and obviously Rumble is not on the PlayStation 3.

1228
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Well, apparently Rumble could be coming back,

1229
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
and the reason why we say could be

1230
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
is because Sony and Immersion have settled

1231
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
their patent litigation.

1232
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Think back, in the past,

1233
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Immersion sued Sony over the Rumble thing.

1234
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
They actually settled with Microsoft,

1235
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and I believe Nintendo had already worked it out

1236
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
with Immersion before they ever put it in there.

1237
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
They worked it out with the other two companies.

1238
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
That's why you have Rumble and the 360 and the Wii.

1239
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
But Sony was just like, well, screw you.

1240
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
We're not going to have Rumble then.

1241
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Rumble is so last-gen, if it's going to be like that.

1242
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Since Wii can dictate what is next-gen and what is not,

1243
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
we're just going to say Rumble is so last-gen.

1244
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Sony seems like a big, whiny child to me.

1245
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
They think they have the edge on the competition,

1246
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
but really, they're just kind of trailing behind

1247
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
in ideas and innovation.

1248
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
This time.

1249
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Well, this time, I mean, all the time.

1250
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
When have they been ahead?

1251
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Okay, granted, they had a DVD drive in the PlayStation 2.

1252
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Okay, good for them.

1253
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
That's good.

1254
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
On top of PlayStation 1 and 2, they were a little bit ahead of time.

1255
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
They were behind on the fucking Rumble technology.

1256
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
They're behind on analog sticks on there.

1257
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And even the controller designs,

1258
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
fucking copying off of the Super Nintendo.

1259
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So, I don't know.

1260
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
They're just playing the copycat game.

1261
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Oh, they did it pretty well the last two gens.

1262
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Well...

1263
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
All right, well, anyway.

1264
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
What makes this whole thing very interesting

1265
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
is what Kazurai had to say after this whole thing.

1266
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Quote,

1267
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
We look forward to exploring with Immersion exciting new ways

1268
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
to bring the largest and best range of gameplay experiences to our customers.

1269
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
We are very excited about our new partnership with Immersion

1270
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
and the potential for new and innovative products

1271
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
incorporating their technologies.

1272
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Great, I gotta buy new controllers now.

1273
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Thank you very much.

1274
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I hope I can trade them in.

1275
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Interesting, I guess is all I can say.

1276
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I mean, not even like three days ago,

1277
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
someone over at Sony, I don't remember who said it,

1278
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
but somebody said it was probably that crazy guy from Sony Europe,

1279
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Phil Harrison.

1280
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I think he was the one that said,

1281
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Rubble is so last gen.

1282
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And now things seem to change on a dime yet again.

1283
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Well...

1284
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
We do, though.

1285
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Anything in this industry, though, does change pretty crazy,

1286
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
including release dates.

1287
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
However, I have a fairly decent list for our UK listeners.

1288
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
So, starting with the releases on the 5th,

1289
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
which would be tomorrow for us, actually it's the 5th there already,

1290
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
is Wario Master of Disguise in the DS.

1291
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Coming up on the 9th is Bullet Witch,

1292
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Castlevania Portrait of Ruin,

1293
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Garfield's Nightmare,

1294
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Grand Theft Auto by City Stories,

1295
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Luminesce Plus,

1296
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2,

1297
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
March of the Minis,

1298
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Rogue Galaxy,

1299
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Runaway 2,

1300
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
The Dream of the Turtle,

1301
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Silver Fall,

1302
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
The Hustle of Detroit Streets,

1303
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2,

1304
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
and Trackmania United on PC.

1305
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Cool.

1306
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
We actually have a pretty good week as far as release dates in the United States.

1307
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Definitely some good stuff,

1308
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
especially one of my favorites,

1309
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
coming to the Playstation 2,

1310
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Grand Theft Auto by City Stories,

1311
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
for the whopping cheap price of $19.99.

1312
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So, you should definitely check it out.

1313
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Of course, I don't think there's going to be multiplayer in there,

1314
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
so that kind of sucks.

1315
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Let's see,

1316
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 for the 360 and the PC,

1317
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Def Jam Icon for Playstation 3 and the 360.

1318
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
That should be pretty cool.

1319
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Titan Quest Immortal Throne for the PC.

1320
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Let's see,

1321
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Motorstorm on the Playstation 3.

1322
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Can't wait to pick that one up.

1323
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Wario, Master of Disguise on the DS,

1324
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
as well as I believe Rayman's Raving Rabbids,

1325
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
and Shrek's Smash and Crash Racing on the DS.

1326
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Burnout Dominator on Playstation 2 and the PSP,

1327
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
and it looks like Tortuga,

1328
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Two Treasures on the PC.

1329
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I do believe there's also a Sudoku game coming out as well,

1330
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
but I don't think anyone's going to pick that up.

1331
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
But that's the big stuff.

1332
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
All right.

1333
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Oh, NBA Street Home Court on the PS3, that's right.

1334
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Coming out over in Japan,

1335
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
because sometimes the games that we get over here

1336
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
are often based off what comes out in Japan.

1337
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Over on the Playstation 3,

1338
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Power Smash 3 is coming out from Sega,

1339
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
but you know the series as Virtua Tennis,

1340
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
and that's coming out on March the 8th.

1341
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
On some other systems,

1342
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
over on the Nintendo Wii,

1343
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Bomberman Land Wii is coming out on March 8th.

1344
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
See, this is why I like doing the same.

1345
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I didn't even know they were making a freaking Bomberman game for the Wii,

1346
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
so there you have it.

1347
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Hopefully much better than Bomberman Act Zero.

1348
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Hopefully they don't take Bomberman into the future.

1349
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
We'll see what happens.

1350
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
A game called iShield 21 from Nintendo

1351
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
is actually coming out over in Japan this week as well.

1352
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It looks like it could be a fighting game or something.

1353
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I'm not sure exactly what this is.

1354
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
They file it into the...

1355
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
It's actually more of an action game, it looks like.

1356
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I'm trying to see what some of the screenshots look like.

1357
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Looks like it has a bunch of different modes in it there,

1358
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
like you kick a ball in one mode as a football player.

1359
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Looks like another one you kind of throw a football.

1360
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I think it might be an amateur Olympics type of game.

1361
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So there you have it.

1362
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Maybe someone in chat will pipe up who knows more about that game.

1363
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Which one?

1364
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
It's called iShield 21.

1365
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
It's an anime-based football game, I think.

1366
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Interesting.

1367
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
If I remember correctly.

1368
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And it's just like, I guess, Imagine Madden,

1369
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
but with fictional football characters, they're anime.

1370
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Alright.

1371
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Coming out on the PlayStation 2,

1372
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
you have Guitar Freaks and Drummania Masterpiece Gold

1373
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
coming out over in Japan.

1374
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
You used to import all those Guitar Freaks games, Jamie.

1375
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Are you going to get this one?

1376
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
No.

1377
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Why not? What made you stop?

1378
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I have a life.

1379
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Alrighty then.

1380
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Major League Baseball 2K6 comes out of Japan

1381
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
for the PlayStation 2 on March 8th.

1382
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
2K6?

1383
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
That's what it says, 2K6.

1384
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Probably 2K7.

1385
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Is that a typo?

1386
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
It could be.

1387
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Probably.

1388
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
No, that's the screenshot for 2K6.

1389
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Holy crap, they're behind.

1390
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Little bit.

1391
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
That's probably 2K7.

1392
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I don't know why you would want to purchase 2K6.

1393
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Maybe they're just a little behind.

1394
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Kenka Banchu 2 Full Throttle also comes out

1395
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
on the PlayStation 2 this week.

1396
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It's another action game.

1397
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Looks like it's probably based on an anime.

1398
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Little fighting game, scary looking man in that game.

1399
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Let's see if there's any other systems

1400
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I want to announce release dates for.

1401
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
How about Nintendo DS?

1402
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
There's a whole lot of crap coming out on the DS

1403
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
this next week.

1404
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Doraemon is coming out.

1405
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Doraemon Nobita no Shinmaki Daibouken is coming out.

1406
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Dragon Sakura DS is coming out as well.

1407
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
EQ Trainer DS, another one of those training games.

1408
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Fun.

1409
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Let's see, a couple of games in the puzzle series

1410
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
from Hudson also coming out as well.

1411
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I should mention this because this is probably

1412
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
the biggest release of the week over for Japan.

1413
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Second Detsetsu Heroes of Mana coming out

1414
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
from Square Enix.

1415
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I imagine that would be the next Mana game

1416
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
that we're going to get over here.

1417
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
We're getting Dawn of Mana next.

1418
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It's probably the same thing, just a different name.

1419
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
That's, of course, speculation from someone

1420
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
who has not done their research on what exactly

1421
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
that game is.

1422
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
No problem.

1423
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I forgot to mention there was some exclusive stuff

1424
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
that we had, of course, this week for release.

1425
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's very small though.

1426
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
There's a brand new Wii game coming out later this year.

1427
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Dave Mirra BMX Challenge for the Wii

1428
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
coming out November, or not November, July 11th.

1429
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And that game, Spelling Spree, which was being released

1430
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
by Ubisoft is now known as Wordplay.

1431
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So I guess they thought Spelling Spree was retarded

1432
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
as a name.

1433
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I would like to thank everyone in chat room

1434
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
who was yelling at me over what Ice Shield 21 is.

1435
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You all watch far more Japanese import animation

1436
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
than I do.

1437
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
There you have it.

1438
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
It's fucking football, don't ask.

1439
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
My bad.

1440
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Yeah, Rob, you should know better.

1441
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Sorry, did you know what it was?

1442
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Did you say anything to try to correct me?

1443
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I know, I like seeing you flounder.

1444
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
You're a bitch.

1445
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I know so.

1446
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Well, speaking of bitchy things,

1447
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
you know, these things that are going to have

1448
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
other companies bitching,

1449
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
it has been speculated that the Wii is going to

1450
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:20,000
outsell the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 through 2008.

1451
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
The market research firm IDC has basically stated

1452
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
that they believe the hardware shipments of the Wii

1453
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
will capture more than a third of the worldwide market

1454
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
by 2008.

1455
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And it will rise above the PS3 and Xbox 360.

1456
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
In related news, I still don't give a shit what an analyst has to say.

1457
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I think it's already proving, though, to be that way.

1458
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Just, you know, look at how it's performing.

1459
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I'll give you that.

1460
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
But I get so sick of these.

1461
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Analyst says this.

1462
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Stories making it to blogs.

1463
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That's why I'm not talking about any stories with analysts.

1464
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And it's catching a lot of news and what have you.

1465
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And you're right.

1466
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
The whole reason I thought that it was relevant

1467
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
is because it is happening.

1468
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It's something that we actually see happening.

1469
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I'll give you that.

1470
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Just like we had this week as well.

1471
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
There was another analyst that said that the PlayStation 3

1472
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
is going to take over by 2010.

1473
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Then there was another analyst that says the Wii is going to take over.

1474
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Then there was another analyst that says that the 360 is going to take over.

1475
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
We need someone to analyze the analyst.

1476
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
So you know what that means?

1477
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It's crap information.

1478
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Your guess is as good as their guess.

1479
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
What do you think about this guess?

1480
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I mean, I actually kind of agree with it.

1481
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I do think the Wii will continue to outpace 360 and PlayStation 3

1482
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
just based on the reactions of people I see who aren't gamers.

1483
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Again, keep in mind, Kars was one of the top selling games last year.

1484
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Not thanks to any hardcore gamer who reads the blogs

1485
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
and thinks that that's the whole gaming world right there in that bubble.

1486
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
The casual gamer is what's going to push the Wii, I believe,

1487
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
ahead of those other two systems.

1488
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I don't think so.

1489
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I think the 360, there's going to be some great games coming out.

1490
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
It's a little bit slow in the beginning of the year.

1491
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
January, there's like Lost Planet coming out.

1492
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Or was it January? There's like two games for the 360.

1493
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Most people were still picking up the Wiis

1494
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
because they couldn't get a hold of them at launch.

1495
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Right now, I think by the end of this year,

1496
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I still think the 360 is going to be beating the crap out of the Wii.

1497
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
But I don't really hear people talking about Lost Planet anymore.

1498
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yet I still hear people talking about Wii Sports.

1499
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Well, that's because people are simpletons and they like Wii Sports.

1500
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Big deal.

1501
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
People are picking up Wii Play, not because of Wii Play,

1502
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
but because it came with another controller.

1503
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Nintendo's just not putting out enough product.

1504
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I have a story here real quick that Nintendo is slow

1505
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
to resupply retailers with brand new Wiis.

1506
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I can attest to that.

1507
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Distribution for the month of March is being cut out of their replenishment cycles.

1508
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Basically, Nintendo has said, guess what?

1509
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
The distributors out there, you're not getting any new Wiis for the month of March.

1510
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
We're giving them all to retailers because we can't make enough.

1511
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
So they right now are having a problem with production,

1512
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
and I think they just need to pump out as main systems,

1513
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:15,000
but eventually it's going to plateau once all those people that were waiting to get one finally get one.

1514
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
But right now, Super Paper Mario is coming out in April,

1515
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
but there's not any real big games announced that have definite dates yet other than the fall.

1516
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
So I think it's going to just plateau.

1517
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Yay, it's the DS drought all over again despite what Mr. Fils-Aime said previously.

1518
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Yeah, seriously, Mario Party's been delayed to whenever, at least summer.

1519
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And then there's really a lot of crappy games coming out.

1520
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
But Zelda Ocarina of Time on Virtual Console.

1521
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Fap, fap, fap.

1522
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Oh goody, great.

1523
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
That's awesome.

1524
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Virtual Console, totally the reason why you should buy a Wii.

1525
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:58,000
It's kind of, you have to admit, for some, again, casual gamers, that kind of appeals to them.

1526
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Well great, but I don't think it's going to sell systems though.

1527
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
I think really right now people saw WarioWare and it was a lot of fun,

1528
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
and they're seeing some of the games coming out probably in March,

1529
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
but there is going to be a drought, and I think that's going to plateau off.

1530
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
If it's the 360, if they have as big of a month as they're planning to in May,

1531
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
it's going to keep going.

1532
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And I think with Game Developer Conference there's going to be some major announcements.

1533
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And then eventually, especially with November, we're just going to see it take off again,

1534
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
with Halo 3 especially.

1535
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
So, I don't know.

1536
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Going back to both these topics here, Gaming Nerd in chat says,

1537
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
by 2010, none of these consoles are going to be good since the next gen will be here,

1538
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
and some console will get released a year before the rest.

1539
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Good point.

1540
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Let's see, also talking about JV Mon says, who the fuck cares about Ocarina?

1541
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Thank you very much, because I think Ocarina is one of the most overhyped games ever.

1542
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I like Ocarina of Time. It's one of my favorite games.

1543
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I like it. I like it.

1544
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It's one of my favorite games.

1545
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
There are certain websites out there that review some of these Zelda games,

1546
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
and because it's Zelda, they give it a 10 out of 10.

1547
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Not saying which websites, but I saw that and rolled my eyes and go,

1548
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
well, I kind of figured you'd do this,

1549
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
seeing as you've got a big heart on over fucking Twilight Princess,

1550
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
which I might add, it's a great game, but it's not perfect.

1551
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I did have a heart on over Twilight Princess, actually.

1552
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
It wasn't fucking the greatest thing on earth.

1553
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I've seen way better.

1554
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
But actually, it was pretty good.

1555
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
But anyway, no, I don't think, for me, Ocarina was no Link to the Past.

1556
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
That was my problem.

1557
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Call me a 2D gamer, whatever, but that was my problem,

1558
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
was Ocarina was no Link to the Past.

1559
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Exactly. So, whatever.

1560
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Controversial viewpoint, sorry, what can I say?

1561
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
That's what we love to have here on this show, our controversial viewpoints.

1562
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
What we also love on this show are other little bits of retro goodness,

1563
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and this always makes me squee,

1564
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
and I notice Rice Princess is here joining us now,

1565
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
so say hello to the fanboys and girls.

1566
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Rice Princess?

1567
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Hello.

1568
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
How are you doing this week?

1569
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Kind of tired.

1570
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Sorry to hear that.

1571
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
You want to nap on the ground there while we do the show?

1572
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
No, it's filthy.

1573
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
All right.

1574
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I don't know if you remember this game, Rice Princess,

1575
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
but coming to the Wii from System 3,

1576
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
we've talked about this previously on the show,

1577
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
but we have some box art now for Impossible Mission coming out to the Wii,

1578
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
and...

1579
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Are you freaking joking? This is awesome.

1580
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
No, I'm not.

1581
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
This is news that just makes you want to shout,

1582
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Ahhhhhhhhhhh.

1583
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It's more like, another visitor, stay a while, stay forever.

1584
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Nobody's going to get that.

1585
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Anyway, Impossible Mission, if you can believe it,

1586
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
came out 25 years ago,

1587
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
was one of the first games to use real synthesized speech,

1588
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
such as the type that Rice Princess and I just performed for you guys.

1589
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Keep in mind, this is not Mission Impossible.

1590
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,720
This was I guess you could call it a spoof game. There's some cool little screenshots there

1591
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,360
These are from the DS version of the game, but look at that

1592
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:12,940
It's like it's like what they did right with this is the same damn game. Just would like really pretty graphics

1593
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,120
That's pretty cool, and it's also coming out on the PSP

1594
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:21,880
You can see PSP DS and Wii so very curious to see what's gonna happen there also. What's new to this game

1595
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,960
There is a new tutorial mode

1596
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,720
There's also three game modes and three characters to choose from

1597
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:32,880
The characters look to be the dude that was in the original game a chick now

1598
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:38,320
Is that chick or a guy with long hair actually can't tell oh, no, it's a chick and a robot named gamma

1599
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,240
What

1600
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,240
What it is a robot

1601
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,640
Anyway, the three game modes you can play new

1602
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:53,340
Original and of course the hybrid mode the original game with the updated graphics swoon

1603
01:10:53,340 --> 01:11:00,100
Okay, so when you play the robot does he say get him my humans like that doesn't make sense. Why a robot what the hell?

1604
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:03,460
Maybe it's like a Android or something

1605
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:08,900
I don't know can't you still say get him my robots, and it's you know cuz what they did they shot out little electricity beams

1606
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:14,260
And if you're made of metal, that's probably gonna hurt. I don't know that just seems a little bit shady to me

1607
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:16,260
I don't know if I want this game anymore

1608
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:20,980
You're gonna not buy this game based off the fact you could play as a robot

1609
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:28,580
Yeah, and I could also just play it like on the Commodore 64 like it originally was but new game modes

1610
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:30,420
so

1611
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,900
All right, I'm totally buying it for the Wii. I'm looking forward to this game so much

1612
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:39,580
Did they ever say if this is coming to the u.s.. For sure because I know this is coming to

1613
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:45,660
Europe and I can see the box art has the Europe ratings on it, but did they ever say they confirm this for the u.s.

1614
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:51,020
Oh, well, I know the same company is putting out elevator action, and that's coming to the u.s.. So we're probably it is

1615
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:55,100
I hope so I hope so system 8 or whatever we should call them and get an interview

1616
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:58,180
I'm gonna do that system 3 system 3 sorry

1617
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,540
I don't know why I thought this is me system 3

1618
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:04,740
I'm gonna call them try to get an interview and beg and plead for impossible mission like a sad little fanboy

1619
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,660
Well

1620
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:13,020
Speaking of a sad little fanboys, but nothing actually having to do with sad little fanboys

1621
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,020
Um guess what is coming out to the Wii? Thanks to the Vendee?

1622
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,580
we are getting Scarface and

1623
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:24,820
Which is kind of funny because you know with the game that it being you're actually gonna be using

1624
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:33,300
The nunchuck to walk to drive to walk around to pilot boats, and you shoot using the wiimote and

1625
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:38,740
You even have a chainsaw for hand-to-hand combat, so you have to wiggle it around and all that

1626
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:44,780
But um we're on the ps2 and Xbox ones you had to swear to increase your kill factor

1627
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:48,140
You do it by making dirty gestures with your wiimote

1628
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:53,520
The more you gesture the more your kill factor goes up hot sluts yes or no

1629
01:12:53,520 --> 01:13:00,100
I see nothing regarding hot sluts there are hot but the game good the guy will take place after the final

1630
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:02,940
mansion shootout

1631
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:09,380
Um OMG spoilers, oh come on the movies from 1983 Rob

1632
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:17,460
It's basically he doesn't die and he has to re instead he has to reclaim his fortune wait

1633
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:22,100
He dies at the end. Yes. He dies at the end of the movie. Oh great next thing

1634
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:25,580
I know you're gonna. Tell me that like freakin Darth Vader's father Tony

1635
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:31,040
You tell me like freakin you know the Titanic sinks in that movie

1636
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,620
I mean, what else do you want to ruin for me while you're here?

1637
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:37,540
I'm sorry I have to kick somebody out of chair room

1638
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:46,260
Is somebody being bad, I don't know somebody's being punished. I told Nintendo maniac 64 not to use the

1639
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:54,580
The what you're listening to shit in the chair really that stuff annoys yeah, so next next time is gonna be a ban

1640
01:13:54,580 --> 01:14:01,820
So regularly yep, I don't care who it is. We have rules for what if I'm listening to hot sluts porn I don't care

1641
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:05,960
No one gives a shit about what anybody else is listening to he's supposed to be listening to the show

1642
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:10,740
All right anyhow anything else on Scarface you want to add um

1643
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:16,420
No all right anyways, there's speaking of game Nate kills Tony

1644
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:23,220
Speaking of games on the Wii there is a trend that we're gonna start seeing much like we did yes where

1645
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:30,220
Companies go hey, we're making games for the Wii too, and then you're like well. What games do you have and they're like well?

1646
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:38,960
Yeah, they're they're awesome games. I'm sure you've heard of them anyways one such company is this company called Metro and

1647
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:46,980
Yes Metro or I guess data design interactive they are putting out some

1648
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:52,540
Any crappy games including such wonderful hits as

1649
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:58,380
Action girls, and yes, they have every ethnicity on the front cover of that one

1650
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:04,040
Ninja-bread man, which kind of looks funny dude Ninja bread man sounds awesome

1651
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:11,700
Talking about crap games this sounds great monster trucks extreme trucks spell trux of course

1652
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:19,220
And oh god. I can't even Jamie isn't that one of your favorite things ever when they purposefully missed like Bratz BRATZ

1653
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:22,620
That's retarded. Oh, it's monster trucks extreme

1654
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:26,900
Off-road edition because I guess the last game was on road

1655
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:32,100
Not like is that related to Big Mother truck us. No. It's probably just a crappy game

1656
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:35,060
Anubis 2

1657
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:38,140
Rock and roll adventures

1658
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:44,100
Hamster yeah, that's like rock and roll high school. I'm so there no. It's not a hamster heroes

1659
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:49,360
How can you call these bad games hamster heroes that sounds amazing?

1660
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,500
mini desktop racing

1661
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,200
These will be the people to put out laser cats

1662
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:02,180
Trixie in Toyland London taxi rush hour, and let's see what else we had it Billy the wizard

1663
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:09,500
I can't even read what that said. It was I think it's like fucking Oh rocket broomstick racing and

1664
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:18,860
Was mischief not mischief me sir, I don't know some stupid go-kart game this game sound incredible

1665
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:22,100
Can you get us on some type of like if this is like a little bitty company?

1666
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:27,660
We ought to be able to get on their press list get some advanced. I want to play hamster heroes data design interactive

1667
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:32,780
Well, we could check out send them an email Loki get a touch with also tell them we will promote hamster heroes

1668
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:35,960
You're on the program and ninja bread man. I like hamsters

1669
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,940
But you know I I don't know if that games gonna be any good and who gives a shit

1670
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:46,660
They're putting out chicken shoot on fucking you know the Wii so you know what I think it's

1671
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:51,260
Only fair that they're allowed to put these games up just all you have to do

1672
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:58,340
You monster trucks extreme at least better than monster 4x4 world circuit because that game was atrocious

1673
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:02,380
Fireboma says rocket broomstick racing sounds like quidditch, but worse

1674
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:07,780
To which somebody else had a follow-up speaking of spoilers because you're talking about spoilers in the last one

1675
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:13,960
GS68 had a comment for Dark Sakura GS68 has figured out who will die in book 7

1676
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:19,580
Harry and Nintendo maniac 64 so he posted that spoiler there in chat, okay?

1677
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,580
and

1678
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:25,980
Let's see well apparently there was a laser cats to on last night on

1679
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:33,020
The old Saturday night live just me it was laser cats to remember it was always laser cats to maybe it was a rerun then

1680
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:34,360
I don't know

1681
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,020
Anyway, let's see what else was there

1682
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,460
Fire Boma says rock and roll high school sounds like a porno

1683
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:46,400
Solid goomba says hamsters are proof. God loves us now now the website

1684
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,780
I agree to be fair the company data design interactive to be fair

1685
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:57,020
They did put out earache extreme metal racing which apparently is a pretty cool game

1686
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:01,140
I mean it mixes heavy metal with racing so these guys sound like

1687
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:09,340
Modern-day genius says they know the types of games people want who doesn't want Ninja bread man. It's just I don't know

1688
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:13,260
Please explain to me. How this could possibly be a bad thing

1689
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:16,980
They're in the UK so I mean that's even better

1690
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,300
Now Jamie's gonna want him to

1691
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:26,300
We can talk no one can contact their projects director. The hamster thing just sounds dirty I

1692
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,220
Want them on the show I will do whatever it takes

1693
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,580
Anyhow um I?

1694
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:39,340
Think this is interesting and this is one group that will not be playing

1695
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:44,340
Any of these games on the Wii anytime soon? What's basically going on? Is that?

1696
01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:46,060
There's this

1697
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:53,380
Christian group and they call themselves the porn talk which is backed by basically a faith-based ministry

1698
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,940
They've started a website that basically says has this huge banner on it

1699
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:03,140
And it says we have a porn problem porn safety facts for Nintendo's

1700
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:05,460
Wii gaming console if you want to visit the site

1701
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:09,620
it's the porn talk calm and actually I looked at the site earlier and

1702
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:17,260
You know basically they're just trying to prevent children from seeing pornography like did you know that?

1703
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:22,100
You know there could be pornography hidden away and all these things we need to keep kids away from porn

1704
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:28,100
There could be porn in your Wii because the Wii has access to the internet therefore there is porn I

1705
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:33,900
Would like to also point out to the geniuses behind the porn talk calm that the computers you use

1706
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:40,300
That the computers you used to make the porn talk calm that you're urging your kids to go check out to keep them away from

1707
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,260
Porn or what okay?

1708
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:43,020
I guess they're really not doing that but you're urging

1709
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:48,620
Parents to go check out to keep their kids away from porn that device can also be used to access porn

1710
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:55,860
If your child has a cell phone that can be used to access or something funny to a dollar or what is it?

1711
01:19:56,380 --> 01:20:00,620
395 that can be used to access porn at your local

1712
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:04,100
Is somebody fucking racing outside? That's why I don't like having the window open.

1713
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:05,100
In your apartment complex.

1714
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,860
Anyways, I gotta I gotta add this real quick. Yeah

1715
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:12,820
Now imagine if you will they tell them yeah, go to that porn talk site

1716
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:16,780
They'll teach you how to you know prevent you know seeing porn and stuff, okay?

1717
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:22,160
They don't remember what the website name was so they search for porn talk boom porn there you go

1718
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,860
they've been they've been uh

1719
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:31,620
The porn beat them to the website, so I don't know they're bragging on their site that porn

1720
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:36,100
Talk won best in show at the Addy Awards and all this. What the fuck's the Addy Award?

1721
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:42,100
I don't know who cares. It's the award show where we invited just us and we won because we're awesome

1722
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:47,180
We've been taking we've been talking about the Wii and Wi-Fi devices on the porn talk blog

1723
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:53,420
We'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this issue and your suggestions on dealing with devices that come with internet capabilities

1724
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:57,300
They should be banning PCs next then in a max, and you know

1725
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:01,000
Your cell phone why don't you crawl into a cave?

1726
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:06,780
I'm just looking at some interesting comments on the actual site itself. I figure there's these comments are posted publicly

1727
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,780
There's no problem with me reading them on air correct

1728
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,780
Ray said I'm all for talking to your kids about porn

1729
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:17,860
But the porn talk calm goes a little overboard using filtering software on your 17 year old is a little outrageous

1730
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:22,220
He or she will be in college the next year. Do you really want them so sheltered?

1731
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:27,820
They'll go crazy not to mention the chances are your 17 year old will know a lot more about computers than you and will have

1732
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:34,100
No problem getting any content. They want in related news. Ray is the olr not listener of the week

1733
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:41,020
Common-sense people fucking use it

1734
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:49,600
And you know there are ways to block the internet for your new children, I don't download the thing

1735
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:56,040
There you go, but of course that would involve the parents being involved so

1736
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,840
Yeah, that's not going to ever happen. That's never going to work

1737
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:08,280
I mean come on gs68 makes an excellent point in chat gs68 over at chat dot orange launch radio com says women have boobs

1738
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:10,740
Women are Gateway to porn

1739
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:16,160
There you go. It's all women's fault. What do you think about that dark soccer? Oh, yes boobs

1740
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:19,840
Oh, it's so all of our fault. You know and while they're at it

1741
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:25,840
You know how about you know putting live birth on TV too because that you know that shows off the coochie

1742
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:30,700
Or well don't they already have to show the miracle of life as part of like education and schools

1743
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,120
Not if you live in Alabama

1744
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:37,920
I was well that was a gateway to pornography the minute the minute I saw a baby flying out of that woman's vagina

1745
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,640
I knew I never ever wanted to touch one

1746
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:45,040
a health ed made you gay

1747
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,000
Yeah, yeah sex education made me gay

1748
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:58,120
I think I don't know anyway obviously stories about these you know crazy people who you know go oMG porn and have these you know

1749
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:17,200
Hair trigger reaction to this kind of crap get us angry and when we get angry. It's time for our f us of the week

1750
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:23,200
My F of the week goes towards people who say you're not so-and-so, so you don't know

1751
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:27,480
Like you're not a parent. So you have no right to talk about children. Um

1752
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:35,160
No, I'm intelligent. I have a brain. I'm observant. I've had little brothers as

1753
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,400
A human being and as a woman who may one day give birth to children

1754
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:47,040
Shiver not you just the baby flying out of your vagina I

1755
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:54,920
Think that that completely discounts anything that you have to say when people start off with you don't know

1756
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,080
Because you are not you know

1757
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:04,040
That instantly removes all credibility from any argument that you might have by it because you're trying to immediately dismiss the other party

1758
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:09,240
That doesn't put you in a superior position that puts you in a position of ignorance fucking shut your mouth

1759
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,200
I'm done

1760
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:18,760
Loki um, I guess f you the apartment complex for not actually having lines in the parking lot

1761
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,560
So everyone has to kind of guess to where the cars are supposed to be

1762
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,400
So that kind of sucks and have have you noticed that none of these blogs that point out, you know

1763
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:31,600
The porn on the psp and porn on the we and stuff. Nobody's talking about the PlayStation 3

1764
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,000
At all one owns a PlayStation 3

1765
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:41,400
Exactly. So more porn for me and in high definition. So hell yeah

1766
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:50,240
The Rob D in chat says I like how sky takes it sound like vaginas or rocket launchers in a way they kind of are

1767
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,720
Right, Jamie

1768
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:54,840
No

1769
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,840
All right. Anyhow

1770
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:01,800
My F you at the week goes to lack of sleep because I swear like every night this week

1771
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,520
I got maybe four hours of sleep at the most of court granted. That's my own damn ball

1772
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:11,200
I know it's the go to bed early Rob. Well, you know, there's Beth. There's there's such good TV on at 2 in the morning

1773
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:17,320
What can I say? No, you know for circumstance, so I was just exhausted yesterday when Jamie and I were running around San Francisco yesterday

1774
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,040
I was so tired. I thought I was gonna pass out

1775
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:24,720
I slept for 11 hours last night, but I feel I feel pretty good today if a big groggy from oversleeping

1776
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,920
so if you do lack of sleep and

1777
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:32,120
And that's it rice princess left blank lanky style left

1778
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:36,400
So we're the only ones in studio. So back to the gaming news then since there's no more F use of the week

1779
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,240
Actually, I have one more F you of the week what I lied

1780
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,920
Apparently, you know this fucking article. Okay?

1781
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,000
alright, um

1782
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,600
One of the major British driving schools BSM, which I immediately misread as BDSM

1783
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:54,320
Took a survey. I misread it as BM and thought you

1784
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:59,200
Took a survey of a thousand drivers between the ages of 16 to 24

1785
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:05,560
About video games how it's affecting their driving habits and the results stated

1786
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,560
27% admitted to taking more risks on the road after playing a racing game

1787
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:14,160
And of course saying they pretend they're actually in a video game when they drive

1788
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:21,400
They're saying that that's a an indisputable link between gaming and dangerous driving

1789
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,400
Um

1790
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,600
What they're not really paying attention to is that

1791
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:34,680
If they're interviewing people between the ages of 16 and 24 chances are that your audience is not going to be very fucking mature

1792
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,080
and

1793
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:40,520
Not going to have the skill to know about you know

1794
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,240
how to drive properly

1795
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:50,920
It's you're dying to say something over there Loki they feel the mention is all those people that said they drive recklessly women

1796
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:58,140
Of course then again. I mean I can't imagine too many of them actually twenty foot seven percent. Yeah, that sounds about right

1797
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,680
I don't know

1798
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,640
It doesn't matter anyways if even if they weren't playing video games. It's still be crashing this shit

1799
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:09,680
I swear to God people talking on their cell phone drifting in and out of lanes Oh

1800
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:15,820
Okay, the funniest thing happened to me today. I bought food. Oh my god

1801
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:23,080
Meanwhile people are dying and just like totally oblivious to the fuck. How did I end up in this river?

1802
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,960
They've totally jumped out in front of me. It's like I

1803
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,720
think anything

1804
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,760
that

1805
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,040
Has an effect on

1806
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:38,920
Your react like if you have a predisposition toward anger or

1807
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:43,760
Nervousness you're that's what's gonna. I think more effect. How you drive

1808
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:47,600
Not so much the game. I mean

1809
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,620
That's just that's really I mean even when I was a new driver

1810
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:56,440
You know playing hard driving didn't make me want to go out and do a loop the loop on the road

1811
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,960
But then again hard driving you were driving super damn slow at least it felt slow in the game

1812
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,760
It's not playing a driving video game that makes you want to drive fast

1813
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:09,560
It's the fucking Wangan midnight maximum tune to soundtrack that makes me want to drive fast

1814
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,360
Try and catch me now fucking coppers

1815
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,840
exactly in the beat to be a little bit serious there I

1816
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:28,680
Would think of anything playing video games would help you drive better because you're actually gonna have a faster reaction time

1817
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:35,400
You know from games. They've actually helped you improve your reaction time a little bit. I would think so

1818
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,500
Whatever it's a fucking survey survey suck

1819
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:43,960
Survey says you say

1820
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,440
So funny you shouldn't be playing

1821
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:53,320
You know that kind of music, but uh Yuzo kashiro is gonna be DJing play

1822
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:57,300
Actually the concert in June

1823
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:02,280
They're going to be he's going to be DJing. I believe it's the concert in Japan. I know in

1824
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,520
Singapore I better start driving to Singapore

1825
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,400
Yes Rob drive to Singapore

1826
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:19,400
Through the ocean that'll be awesome. I'll drive so fast. I'll float on the water come on

1827
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,680
Right or maybe you'll just fart so hard you

1828
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:25,680
Float over the water

1829
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,520
But I thought that was pretty cool

1830
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:33,360
And you know he's done such music from like you know streets of rage revenge of shinobi Actraiser

1831
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,880
Castlevania portrait ruin

1832
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,040
lots of stuff so

1833
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:43,200
Gonna be spinning some tracks too bad. He's not coming over here. Just in Singapore ah

1834
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:49,800
Bandit is my new best friend in chat if Sonic can do it. Why can't sky. Thank you very much

1835
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:55,760
Sonic is a fictional blue hedgehog. I don't think hedgehogs move that fast anyways

1836
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,220
You're just pokey I

1837
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,040
Think it was irony or something

1838
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,480
And hamster heroes is there a really is there a hamster that runs real fast

1839
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:11,760
I think there's one that looks like Batman scary. Oh my god. This is the best game ever

1840
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:20,040
Fucking hamsters have you ever had a hamster? Do you know I mean they in in grade school?

1841
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,880
I just remember whenever like you go in the classroom that has a hamster

1842
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,600
It smells like poop and they poop out pellets, which I always thought was amazing

1843
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:31,720
Let me tell you a story about hamsters real quick. Hey hamsters are retarded. They're pretty real

1844
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:36,840
The reason you would own a hamster is to watch how retarded it is I had a hamster

1845
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:43,200
We named him Sam because it was squeaks and moves. That's you know basically what stood for that's so creative anyways

1846
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,760
So the hamster would spend hours

1847
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:50,800
Doing this it would climb up the side of cage climb upside down

1848
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:57,840
Fallen's head climb upside and just keep doing that over and over and over again. Well. You know why the hamster was so crazy

1849
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,840
Oh

1850
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:10,760
I'll let the joke go now. Thank you anyways, but yeah one funny thing about hamsters

1851
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:14,040
Oh, they actually throw their poop like footballs out of their cage

1852
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,600
This is the Wii game

1853
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:22,400
I want they sit there their feet fucking up in the air pull the poop out of their ass and they throw it

1854
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:29,720
It is the weirdest thing to see but you guys don't understand why I'm laughing so hard

1855
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,960
Because thank God, this is a TV

1856
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,600
But Loki actually put his feet up in the air

1857
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,720
And reached

1858
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,800
Rob's all red in the face of a horrible oh

1859
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:50,300
My god. We need a TV show just for moments like that. We do

1860
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:51,620
we

1861
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:56,900
Have a hamster on the TV show, but a cape on maybe that should be our new mascot is a hamster

1862
01:31:56,900 --> 01:32:01,700
They have a little bit about you too, so it's not worth it and every single one of them dies from cancer, so

1863
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:04,660
not even worried

1864
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:09,540
Not even worth it of course all the chat rooms shouting hamster dance hamster dance

1865
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:18,680
This is something that will make you dance the news that Raiden 4 is coming to the Xbox 360

1866
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:26,400
Also, we're getting a localized version of Raiden 3 on the PlayStation 2, and that's coming from UFO interactive

1867
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:35,480
And let's see that's coming out for $30 and that by the way originally showed up in Japan in September of 2005

1868
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:38,200
So it's like one of those hey, it's about freaking time. We got that over here

1869
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,560
It was supposed to come out last year around August as well

1870
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:45,280
But then company it's which company excess game dropped it so yeah, whatever anyhow

1871
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:50,800
I should be noted though that Raiden 4 is coming out on Xbox 360 for those of you unfamiliar with the franchise

1872
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,320
It's just one of those shooter games that you know a lot of people love so

1873
01:32:56,120 --> 01:33:00,560
There you go. I'm sure it's gonna be very pretty on the Xbox 360. I'm very excited about that

1874
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:06,520
It is a it should be noted. It's a retail game not an Xbox Live arcade game, so that

1875
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,340
Should tell you what you know they're going for here with that game should be fun

1876
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:17,700
Well something that's not quite so fun. Though is that for everybody who is on the Metal Gear online?

1877
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:20,220
All five of you. Hey

1878
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:24,900
The the Metal Gear Solid 3 subsistence online servers

1879
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:30,740
Is a going bye-bye it as of April 2nd. It will be gone

1880
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:34,460
The community is not big enough

1881
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:42,540
Community is not big enough now the user community for the game those who loyal to it are putting up internet petitions

1882
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:47,740
To try to keep it up, but it's in the category of not fucking lightly

1883
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,300
Sorry

1884
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:54,340
Good luck if it works petitions don't usually magically fix everything

1885
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:59,060
But I know that's got to suck to get the plug pulled music game fans got amplitudes plug pulled on them a couple

1886
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:04,340
But but again an amplitude came out like five years ago, Metal Gear substance three subs

1887
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:09,240
Subsistence I can ever buy your go. Yeah, it's not that old is in March subsistence

1888
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:12,540
I got it subsistence yeah, and to be honest it

1889
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:17,380
Just didn't sell that well and how many people use the online and this is what you get when you have you know fucking networks

1890
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:21,380
That run by each individual company so one centralized network like live

1891
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:27,700
People start pulling servers because why bother paying for a server that you know no one's playing on so

1892
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:29,700
whatever

1893
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:35,100
But anyways so speaking of games that I think people are not really playing Phantasy Star Universe

1894
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:38,340
Oh, no, there's one girl on my friends list

1895
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:43,340
That's always freaking playing Phantasy Star Universe that game has dropped down to 20 bucks now seriously

1896
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:49,620
It's not a bad game because the single-player mode is kind of fun, and you know it's like I see the online mode

1897
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:55,620
It's like a kind of free enhancement to it. It's not that bad. No, but it wasn't the magic didn't last long yeah

1898
01:34:55,620 --> 01:35:01,820
um well Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion of the it's called the ambition of illuminus and

1899
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:08,180
There's going to be some pretty cool stuff as well. I think this has already come out in Japan

1900
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:11,360
But they're going to be getting some new weapon types

1901
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:18,060
including some photon whips and slicers new stages even a casino and

1902
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:24,740
and um apparently the casino is run by penguin esque wrappies. Maybe I should go back to psu

1903
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:29,480
That sounds neat. I like penguins. I like wrappies

1904
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:37,820
Your wrappies no if you if you've done the wrappy holiday quest you will never like wrappies again

1905
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:43,700
Which I believe is still going in the Phantasy star online or the old PSL

1906
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:49,060
I believe the Christmas quest is still going on the Xbox one as it has been for the past not 360

1907
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:55,980
But the rage it was going on blue burst for like six months. Yeah, seriously. Oh geez that's awesome

1908
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:58,240
They're all oh crap. We still have that game

1909
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:03,540
Hmm and for anyone who'd like to know I uh quit psu last week

1910
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:10,020
Congratulations. Yeah, this that goes to show just what my opinion of psu is so

1911
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:15,400
I've been playing world of warcraft, and I'm trying to get Jamie to join our

1912
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:20,660
Excuse me our little guild. We've got going on Ravencrest, so I think I talked her into it

1913
01:36:20,660 --> 01:36:23,300
How about when I have time and when someone gets me burning crusade?

1914
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:26,060
All right, how about we take a break?

1915
01:36:26,060 --> 01:36:31,420
We're gonna go to a breaks a break and when we come back. We'll have more of orange lounge radio more

1916
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:36,060
Hilarious things coming out of Loki's mouth and other orifices probably

1917
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:40,500
In the next part part B because we have a lot of 360 news we haven't gotten to yet

1918
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,220
So we'll see you back in a little bit for orange lounge radio part B

1919
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:48,720
Orange lounge radio is taped live on Sunday nights and it's podcast to the world twice a week

1920
01:36:48,720 --> 01:37:06,720
