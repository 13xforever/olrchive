1
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:19,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, March 4th, 2007, drama ensues over Sony's rumored PlayStation Home.

2
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:26,318
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about who is starting an anti-Wii campaign, and the popular new computer game is rumored to be making a jump to Xbox Live.

3
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:38,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet, on their iPods, their Zens, whatever devices you're using to listen to us.

4
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:43,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe your Xbox 360, thanks to the 360 cast or whatever that thing was called.

5
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:45,616
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,639
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a show dedicated to video games and gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:54,842
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:55,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo.

9
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:57,103
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing, Mr. Jamie Summers?

10
00:00:58,604 --> 00:00:58,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Ow.

11
00:00:59,565 --> 00:00:59,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Ow?

12
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:00,165
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong?

13
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:01,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Your head hurt?

14
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:01,686
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

15
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:02,262
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

16
00:01:03,103 --> 00:01:03,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Female owl.

17
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:04,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, oh.

18
00:01:05,405 --> 00:01:05,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

19
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:07,186
[SPEAKER_03]: The TMI type of owl, huh?

20
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:07,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

21
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

22
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:11,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure we'll have some extra special FUs tonight.

23
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,251
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, a good weekend.

25
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:15,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie and I had a play day yesterday in San Francisco.

26
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:16,014
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.

27
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:16,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:16,874 --> 00:01:17,375
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a good time.

29
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:19,617
[SPEAKER_08]: And we both have really hot hair now.

30
00:01:20,077 --> 00:01:21,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we got our hair done.

31
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:23,900
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first time I've ever paid $45 for a haircut.

32
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,121
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks nice.

33
00:01:25,762 --> 00:01:26,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Be glad.

34
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:28,764
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how much I pay for mine.

35
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:30,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that a sexist thing?

36
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:33,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I have more hair and I have more shit done to my hair.

37
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:35,575
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I was a dude with long hair?

38
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:36,897
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd probably charge you more.

39
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:37,438
[SPEAKER_03]: You think?

40
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:37,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

41
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I would ever have long hair, but I've seen guys with longer hair than a lot of women I know.

42
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:44,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like Marissa's boyfriend.

43
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:45,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's true, yeah.

44
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,212
[SPEAKER_08]: He's got gorgeous...

45
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,836
[SPEAKER_08]: and gorgeous supermodel hair.

46
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:56,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of, if I remember right, I think he chopped it off at one point, but remember Blue from DDR Freak, who's really into Pump It Up?

47
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't he have kind of long hair?

48
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:59,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, he almost had it in a ponytail, didn't he?

49
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:01,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he had really, really long hair.

50
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:02,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's who I kind of think of.

51
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:03,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember him.

52
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:05,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, say hello as well.

53
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:11,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we talk about people who aren't here to defend themselves too much, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

54
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm here.

55
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:14,731
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

56
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:15,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.

57
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:22,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, I see you have not one, but two PSPs up and running with Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

58
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:23,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you playing against yourself tonight?

59
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:24,668
[SPEAKER_03]: What is going on here?

60
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:26,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was just testing stuff.

61
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:28,629
[SPEAKER_09]: He's playing with himself on live radio.

62
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:31,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun, what types of things are you testing out?

63
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:39,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Dark Galaxy's custom firmware, because it allowed me to run PS1 games on it.

64
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:43,639
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

65
00:03:07,216 --> 00:03:08,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Such as I've done for the past three weeks.

66
00:03:08,516 --> 00:03:15,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So the custom firmware that I got, I got like a nice two gig memory stick so I can put, you know, PlayStation 1 games on there.

67
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:21,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of what I was doing because I, you know, have this other PlayStation or PSP.

68
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, what the hell am I going to do with this thing?

69
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:27,542
[SPEAKER_02]: So load up a custom firmware and I can make it all pretty because you can edit all the icons.

70
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:29,723
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add the waves in the background, everything.

71
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:33,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And you run Homebrew off of a memory stick.

72
00:03:33,544 --> 00:03:34,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus you can run...

73
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:39,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Programs that require firmware 3.10 or 3.03, I guess.

74
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:42,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like the best of both worlds.

75
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:45,018
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

76
00:03:45,318 --> 00:03:48,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Also joining us tonight, we don't have any other guests in studio.

77
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,119
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a first.

78
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:50,720
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had that in a long time.

79
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,160
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be a relatively quiet show tonight.

80
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

81
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:54,481
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

82
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,561
[SPEAKER_03]: The three of us will entertain you the best we can.

83
00:03:56,581 --> 00:04:01,463
[SPEAKER_03]: But, of course, we always have our invisible other guest with us every week, the chat room.

84
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:04,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's accessible over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

85
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,270
[SPEAKER_03]: XB Stream.

86
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:09,732
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the name of the Xbox 360 program I was trying to think of at the beginning.

87
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,753
[SPEAKER_03]: You can listen to us on XB Stream.

88
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:13,614
[SPEAKER_03]: We're one of the default podcasts.

89
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:15,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot about that.

90
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:19,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to the XB Stream folks, and don't be too mad at me for forgetting your name.

91
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:20,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

92
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:22,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the chat room there.

93
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:24,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Canogram says, the soundboard is cursed.

94
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:26,840
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really use a soundboard.

95
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,060
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just Winamp.

96
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing too fancy.

97
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:29,721
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Rob.

98
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:30,799
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my fault.

99
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:35,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, if I did switch to a soundboard, it would probably be easier, but I don't like the whole soundboard setup thing.

100
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:41,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I feel like if I had a soundboard, I would use it far too much.

101
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:48,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say there's other shows out there that do use it too much, but I'm just thinking that we'd probably use it too much.

102
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:52,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaze says that's three weeks in a row they've effed up the soundboard.

103
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:53,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, something like that.

104
00:04:53,807 --> 00:04:54,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't eff up anything.

105
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:56,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I was sitting here in my chair.

106
00:04:58,249 --> 00:04:58,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Sitting here.

107
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,501
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see.

108
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Damani says, I got Crash Bandicoot on my PSP.

109
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:06,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when Crash Bandicoot was cool?

110
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:07,007
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

111
00:05:07,347 --> 00:05:10,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Before it went the way of Spyro and all those other franchises.

112
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,831
[SPEAKER_03]: They just drove into the ground.

113
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:13,293
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I never remember it being cool.

114
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:14,734
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool at one point.

115
00:05:14,774 --> 00:05:16,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Crash Bandicoot 2 was the first PlayStation game I ever owned.

116
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:18,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I never remember that game being cool.

117
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whatever.

118
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:20,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

119
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,221
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is here?

120
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:25,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Firebomba says, anyway, anyone here play Magic?

121
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:30,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't since I was in college the first time around.

122
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:36,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I sold my deck when I was a junior in high school, which was a long time ago, over 10 years ago, if you can believe it.

123
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's still going strong.

124
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the old computer game.

125
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:43,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the one you could play online, but the very first computer game that ever came out.

126
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:44,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I really liked that.

127
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:47,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember you walked around a map and battled other people.

128
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:49,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I should try and find that and play it again.

129
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:54,946
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of fun, but I don't think they really make it anymore because didn't they go online with it?

130
00:05:55,518 --> 00:06:01,420
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100 Matt says, I remember the old Crash commercials where he would always cause trouble outside of Nintendo.

131
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that as well.

132
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:04,862
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

133
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:07,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, also, RK1HexAugust31st wants to know,

134
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,987
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the part where you call out the noobs?

135
00:06:23,268 --> 00:06:24,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, alright, we can do that.

136
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:25,669
[SPEAKER_03]: The noobs in chat tonight.

137
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I don't rec- again, I'm going off memory.

138
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,992
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you may have to help me if you don't recognize any of these names.

139
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:33,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, well, first off, that name I just named is new.

140
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:35,555
[SPEAKER_03]: RK1HexOg31.

141
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:36,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

142
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:38,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Broodwitch, I think, is new.

143
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Alistar, I recognize from our World of Warcraft guild.

144
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:42,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

145
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:44,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, who else is new?

146
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I recognize any other new names.

147
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:48,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Jodrew?

148
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:49,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we had that before?

149
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:49,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be new, too.

150
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:50,581
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

151
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:50,641
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

152
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:20,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Metroid.

153
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I know you're really, well, then you should really like Castlevania Symphony of the Night because it ripped off Metroid in many ways, but that's what made it so great.

154
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to kick DM in too, just because.

155
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:29,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, do it.

156
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:31,247
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I going to say?

157
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:35,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Rondo of Blood you love, but Symphony of the Night was kind of in some ways a sequel to Rondo of Blood.

158
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,891
[SPEAKER_03]: You love Symphony of the Night a lot, right?

159
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:40,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was a sequel to Rondo of Blood.

160
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:40,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

161
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:44,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to play it on Xbox Live Arcade?

162
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:47,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you going to say, eh, why should I download this?

163
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:50,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I already have the PlayStation and Saturn and whatever else.

164
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:55,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't really have a need to because I do have the other versions.

165
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:02,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, to this one's credit, it'll be... If it's the Saturn version, hell yeah.

166
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:03,337
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it won't be.

167
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:03,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, no.

168
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,098
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be enabled for your HDTV.

169
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:12,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, it's got the stupid stagnant graphics on the side, but at least you won't have to worry about altering your TV settings or any of that stuff.

170
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,480
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

171
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:43,538
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

172
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,600
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually is a really good game.

173
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,300
[SPEAKER_08]: It's surprising.

174
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Although the PS3 version, it obviously is just a port.

175
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:09,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Because nothing is prettier.

176
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:11,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, it's really pretty.

177
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:14,908
[SPEAKER_08]: The gameplay itself, but the cinemas are not touched up for it.

178
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:20,892
[SPEAKER_08]: But the only complaint I really have with that game is the camera sometimes getting a little bit weird.

179
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:24,935
[SPEAKER_08]: And the boss is in the Atlantis level right now.

180
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:26,476
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was really cool.

181
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:29,118
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, dude, what the hell is Mysterio doing here?

182
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I've determined that playing as Elektra sucks, but playing as Captain America is fucking awesome.

183
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:38,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he throws the shield and it bounces off the walls while you beat other stuff up.

184
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And then right when they're about to hit you, it bounces them in the head.

185
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:44,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you remember it was kind of that way in an old arcade game.

186
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:48,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they have an old arcade Marvel game that you could play that was very similar?

187
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there was the Avengers game.

188
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,952
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just one of those little side-scrolling games.

189
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:52,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

190
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to remember S.H.I.E.L.D.

191
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,760
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of did the same thing where it bounced around.

192
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, Captain America's awesome.

193
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,620
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

194
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:59,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a mild obsession with Captain America right now.

195
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,642
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, SSJ100, Matt and his Marvel does rock.

196
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:08,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Except I've decided that who rocks more than she does in that game is Spider-Woman.

197
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:15,766
[SPEAKER_03]: For those that maybe don't follow comic books as heavily as you do, because I know you're a bit of a comic fangirl, but maybe, you know, I...

198
00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:17,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

199
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:38,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you have to really follow, I mean, there's so much fun fan stuff thrown in that I think it's really great, but I don't think you really need to be a big fan of, you know, Marvel Comics to get into the game.

200
00:10:38,757 --> 00:10:52,500
[SPEAKER_08]: It does follow the established Marvel Universe, although for some weird reason, like a couple of the characters are in their Ultimate costumes, but I quickly went and changed all of them back to their regular Universe ones, but it was pretty cool.

201
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:55,201
[SPEAKER_08]: That has Nick Fury in it, and he's awesome.

202
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:56,620
[SPEAKER_08]: DC Comics Superman

203
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:22,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Batman, too, right?

204
00:11:22,502 --> 00:11:22,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Batman.

205
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:28,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the X-Men and I love the Avengers, except for Iron Man because he's an asshole right now.

206
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:30,087
[SPEAKER_08]: But I really like Captain America.

207
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:31,067
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

208
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:31,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

209
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at chat room to see some other comics here.

210
00:11:35,951 --> 00:11:38,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks in there are explaining their gaming week.

211
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:41,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I see Brad saying DC Universe beats Marvel every day.

212
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:41,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

213
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:44,256
[SPEAKER_03]: What else is there?

214
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:46,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks have been playing Crackdown.

215
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:48,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a lot of people playing Crackdown this week.

216
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:49,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw X-Men Arcade

217
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:07,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I walked off the screen, aww

218
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:38,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm assuming DarkSakura is done, so Loki, how was your gaming week?

219
00:12:39,074 --> 00:12:39,914
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

220
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Crackdown a lot.

221
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually finished the game, but I'm getting those last few achievements.

222
00:12:46,877 --> 00:12:51,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I have everything maxed out except for firearms now, so I just have to max that out.

223
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already at level 4 on it, but just, you know, almost there.

224
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have to get the rest of the orbs and hidden orbs and all that stuff.

225
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:03,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just working on the last few achievements, but I'm done with the game, so yay.

226
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:04,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

227
00:13:04,628 --> 00:13:06,829
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, what else?

228
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:08,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I played DDR Universe.

229
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:09,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was okay.

230
00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:10,509
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for DDR, I guess.

231
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:14,911
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got really uninterested after a while.

232
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:16,671
[SPEAKER_02]: It took forever to unlock stuff.

233
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:19,031
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of just, eh, don't care.

234
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:21,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hate quest mode.

235
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:22,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's retarded.

236
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:26,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, the challenge mode is kind of cool.

237
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:28,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wish it was stuck with, like, the...

238
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:33,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Interstellar Master Mode Bullet Witch Everything bad you've heard about that game is true.

239
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:33,514
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks balls.

240
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:52,228
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really that bad.

241
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:53,749
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly do you do in Bullet Witch?

242
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:54,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it, but I don't know much about it.

243
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Bullet Witch, you just go around killing things.

244
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:58,973
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing that sucks about it... Like murder.

245
00:13:59,313 --> 00:14:06,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, murder is good, but the game itself, there's no lock-on for anything, and the enemies are really fucking easy.

246
00:14:06,838 --> 00:14:15,745
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, like I said, to be fair, I've only played it for a short amount of time, so I haven't really given it a fair shake yet, but from what I've seen so far, it doesn't look good.

247
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:19,868
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a game that was like first-gen PlayStation 2 or something.

248
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:20,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really...

249
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:27,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it just didn't feel very cool or anything, but, you know, whatever.

250
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:37,396
[SPEAKER_02]: So, gave it a shot, and then I played the Armored Core 4 demo, um, that's out in Japan right now, and that one is awesome, and I can't wait to pick up the full game.

251
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,316
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot faster than Chromehounds.

252
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:44,678
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were turned off by Chromehounds, this might be the game for you, because it's a lot faster.

253
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's three fucking buttons for, you know, boost in the game, so, I mean, you gotta love that.

254
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um,

255
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:52,105
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just pretty cool.

256
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:52,926
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

257
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:58,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it was in Japanese, so I didn't really know what they wanted me to do, but it was fun blowing up things.

258
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:00,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really looking forward to that.

259
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:05,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And... I think that's pretty much all I played this week.

260
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:07,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, lots of Crackdown, though.

261
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:10,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need to play some co-op so I can get that last co-op achievement.

262
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,342
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um... Oh, there's some fun things to do in Crackdown.

263
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:16,603
[SPEAKER_02]: We were messing around with stuff.

264
00:15:17,324 --> 00:15:18,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Driving the...

265
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:24,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Semi-truck round and just boosting through pedestrians like crazy was fun.

266
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:26,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Killing hundreds and hundreds of people.

267
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:32,701
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually level up your driving pretty fast that way because you end up killing more bad guys than you do the actual pedestrians.

268
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:33,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

269
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:36,003
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

270
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:40,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I also played a little bit of Crackdown this week, but not enough to really review the game.

271
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:44,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's odd because I don't really get into those types of games like Crackdown or Grand Theft Auto.

272
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:45,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're kind of fun for five minutes, but

273
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:49,272
[SPEAKER_03]: When I try to play the story mode, I don't really get into them as much.

274
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:59,944
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't really give the game a fair review yet, but I'm going to force myself to play a little more and try to look at it a little more from the perspective of, well, okay, I realize I'm not a fan of this genre, but what my fans of the genre think of it.

275
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:04,069
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm more excited about getting to play the Halo 3 beta finally, after all.

276
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking forward to that as part of Crackdown.

277
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:15,793
[SPEAKER_03]: GameTap gave this thing CPR recently and now it's up and running as of I think Valentine's Day or the day after is when they actually launched this so I went on there to check it out very much unlike any other MMO you've ever played in fact I

278
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:45,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know if it would be fair to call this game an MMO, because if you think this is going to be like a Warcrafty run quest, slash things, kill things, it's totally not like that.

279
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,079
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to remember, Myst was not like that.

280
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:48,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Myst was what?

281
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:58,444
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a puzzle game where you didn't really know what the hell was going on, you just knew you had to do things to unlock the way, and as you explored, you figured out more of the story.

282
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:00,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's exactly what Myst Online is.

283
00:17:00,685 --> 00:17:02,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a game of exploration.

284
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:03,469
[SPEAKER_03]: with other people.

285
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:10,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of weird at first because my brain wasn't really thinking that was what I was getting into, although I should have known better because I played Myst back in the day.

286
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:12,496
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'm thinking, oh, it's an MMO.

287
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:13,596
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go around and kill things.

288
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:14,817
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

289
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:15,818
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nothing like that.

290
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:16,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

291
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:18,839
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

292
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:47,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

293
00:18:09,232 --> 00:18:11,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Download times are atrocious.

294
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:18,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, having to patch the game earlier in the week, there was no percentage bar or anything that showed me how long it was.

295
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:20,156
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear, the game took like an hour to patch.

296
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:29,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, when you try to access new areas in-game, it takes a long time to load up the new areas of the game, because sometimes it's like you're downloading them before you even go there.

297
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand it's trying to download the world to my computer, but I kind of wish there was a little more forewarning or something.

298
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:36,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally had to wait like 30 minutes before

299
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:43,207
[SPEAKER_03]: for some new area to download, and I just bounced, like, from five, from spending, like, only five minutes in another place.

300
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:48,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just kind of exploring, walking around, then suddenly, bam, I gotta wait 30 minutes with no real warning.

301
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:50,709
[SPEAKER_03]: So the load times in the game I was not a fan of.

302
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:59,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think, though, back to the positives, I think if you're the type of person that gets sucked into those, like, reality gaming things, what do they call those things?

303
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the, uh, Loki, you're into AR, alternate universe games?

304
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:04,414
[SPEAKER_03]: ARGs?

305
00:19:05,182 --> 00:19:05,462
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?

306
00:19:05,502 --> 00:19:07,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Alternate Reality Gaming, ARGs.

307
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:08,364
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the popular ones?

308
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:10,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

309
00:19:10,806 --> 00:19:16,911
[SPEAKER_02]: They had one for... Well, they have one right now for... It's not really an alternate reality game.

310
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:20,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's more of a viral site or something, but... Sort of.

311
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:23,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It's... What was it?

312
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:26,878
[SPEAKER_02]: The... Primatechpaper.com or something like that.

313
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:27,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for like heroes and stuff?

314
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:28,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

315
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:31,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, Myst is kind of something like that, but it's like... I mean, it's...

316
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I love bees.

317
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that might be a more viral site.

318
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:43,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Myst Online really takes it to the next level because there are sites that are supposedly made by people in the cavern.

319
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:54,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you're into role-playing a little bit, you'd really be into it because there's people that play IC in cavern, like they pretend that they really are in the cavern, and they really are exploring these worlds and kind of talk with that perspective.

320
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,692
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's people that play OOC out of cavern and kind of talk like it's normal.

321
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Myst Online guides give a real...

322
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:03,706
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

323
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,798
[SPEAKER_03]: by interacting with the real life actors.

324
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:38,900
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do this orientation every hour, Monday through Friday from like, I don't know what it was, like 5 to 10, they do orientations every hour.

325
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:47,481
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually went to one, and there was actually a guy there that kind of talked about what the universe was, and like I even, to make sure it wasn't a robot, I threw out a question and he actually answered it.

326
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:51,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So like there were live people just kind of talking about the game and kind of took you on a tour of the main area.

327
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:56,183
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, if you're really into those like alternate reality things, you're gonna get a kick out of it.

328
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:57,823
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you are

329
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:03,771
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a game where you quest, that has an objective, that has set goals and things you do?

330
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:06,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Myst Online ain't going to be really feeling it for you.

331
00:21:06,212 --> 00:21:11,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't seem like you really interact with people a lot in the beginning.

332
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:13,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something you kind of work towards.

333
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:19,934
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, if you're a GameTap subscriber, obviously you're already paying for Myst Online, so go in there and look at it.

334
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:21,035
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth it.

335
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:22,755
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not...

336
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:25,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Already a subscriber of GameTap.

337
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:27,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it worth it just for Myst Online?

338
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:28,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.

339
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:35,300
[SPEAKER_03]: You really need to check out the demo so you can kind of see for yourself what I'm talking about, that it's not your typical type of MMO, and make your decision from there.

340
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:40,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I still recommend GameTap as a whole because, like, 800-something games for $9.95 a month, I think it's a great service.

341
00:21:41,506 --> 00:21:44,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I talk about it so well on the show you'd think I'm on their payroll, but I'm not.

342
00:21:44,408 --> 00:21:45,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a really great service.

343
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:48,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, if you're a GameTap subscriber, go check it out.

344
00:21:49,272 --> 00:21:52,695
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're out of the country where you don't get GameTap and you're going to have to buy this game separately...

345
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:53,688
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR Universe

346
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,075
[SPEAKER_03]: For the Xbox 360, there's a lot of very good things about Universe.

347
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:08,776
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of very bad things about Universe.

348
00:22:09,256 --> 00:22:10,997
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ancestor Revolution Universe, the good things.

349
00:22:11,357 --> 00:22:12,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Song list, great.

350
00:22:13,018 --> 00:22:13,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the song list.

351
00:22:14,138 --> 00:22:15,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Graphics, pretty cool.

352
00:22:15,819 --> 00:22:17,380
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit vibrant.

353
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to turn them down because they were a little too colorful, but the videos are very well done.

354
00:22:20,762 --> 00:22:21,222
[SPEAKER_03]: They're vibrant.

355
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:24,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, the game is in HD, which gives the game a whole new look.

356
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:24,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very cool.

357
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:26,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Things I didn't like.

358
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Quest Mode, Quest Mode, Quest Mode.

359
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,246
[SPEAKER_03]: That mode is atrocious.

360
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:33,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the worst thing to ever happen to DDR since True Kiss Destination.

361
00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:34,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

362
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:36,389
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awful.

363
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:38,469
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so awful.

364
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:39,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even explain it.

365
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It is like...

366
00:22:41,083 --> 00:23:06,174
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's no questing to it it's just it's like you go to a city and you fucking oh we need to get some fame play songs over and over and over there's no explanation it's poorly done it's basically the same five challenges over and over and they have to unlock things through this mode as a joke so if you're thinking that oh I'm gonna get a thousand easy points from DDR universe no you'll get about 400 from playing just just play each song once

367
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,751
[SPEAKER_03]: but quest mode, it's not even worth it.

368
00:23:08,851 --> 00:23:11,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, wait and see if an unlock code is released.

369
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:14,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Like remember Ultramix 2, like an unlock code came out later that would give you all the unlocks?

370
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:15,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait for that.

371
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:16,635
[SPEAKER_03]: See if something happens.

372
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:19,577
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there is one or not, but hopefully there is because quest mode sucks.

373
00:23:20,177 --> 00:23:21,077
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not even worth it.

374
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:36,205
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in other words, if you are buying this game as a single player who likes all that extra stuff inside DDR, the game itself is really solid, like the songs and the steps and everything, but if you're buying this for quest mode or

375
00:23:37,232 --> 00:23:39,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Live, which basically has all the modes we've seen before.

376
00:23:39,975 --> 00:23:41,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's really a whole lot else.

377
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.

378
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:46,860
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're contemplating upgrading to Xbox 360 just for DDR, don't.

379
00:23:50,452 --> 00:24:18,214
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR is a very unique game and I think it's something you should check out and they made it very beginner friendly which I think is cool and other good things I should say about it real quick other good things is that you know again it's very beginner friendly it does have like the jukebox mode and the edit step and video mode which is kind of neat and again the song list is great the downloads are pretty cool yes they're already on the disc but honestly some of the ultra mixes were done the same way it's you know something extra it's not essential to the gameplay but

380
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:22,403
[SPEAKER_03]: and the basic game itself is fine.

381
00:24:23,724 --> 00:24:30,508
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, some of those other things like just the fact that the frame rate is still a little buggy.

382
00:24:31,048 --> 00:24:34,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, Cowboy Emmy has her head on backwards when you play in certain songs.

383
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out for yourself.

384
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:36,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not joking.

385
00:24:38,672 --> 00:24:42,634
[SPEAKER_03]: For a DDR hardcore fan, there's going to be some things in here that really irk you.

386
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my thing that pissed me off, and I don't know if you noticed it.

387
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have trouble playing on a controller?

388
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:49,903
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

389
00:25:17,506 --> 00:25:18,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is stupid.

390
00:25:19,006 --> 00:25:19,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

391
00:25:20,747 --> 00:25:21,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

392
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:22,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I don't know.

393
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:28,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I do think DDR Universe is a good DDR game because essentially, what does DDR end up being?

394
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:30,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the songs and the steps.

395
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:34,230
[SPEAKER_03]: And DDR delivers on some awesome songs and great steps.

396
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,651
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other stuff kind of built around it?

397
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:38,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so great.

398
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:40,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really hope they patch it up with Universe 2.

399
00:25:41,076 --> 00:25:43,678
[SPEAKER_03]: LankyStyle, do you want to be on the radio tonight?

400
00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:43,758
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

401
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:10,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, tell us about your gaming week anyway, because you're here.

402
00:26:11,547 --> 00:26:13,248
[SPEAKER_03]: With your freshly shaved head, I notice.

403
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:14,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

404
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:15,149
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that about?

405
00:26:15,589 --> 00:26:17,570
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I, Britney Spears.

406
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was going to say Britney Spears.

407
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Britney Spears did it, and I love her.

408
00:26:21,692 --> 00:26:22,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do the spider with her.

409
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:23,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

410
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:25,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's not explain what that is.

411
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:26,974
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

412
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:29,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, pretty good.

413
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:36,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy VI for the GBA, and just dual wielding the Final Fantasies, because that's what I do.

414
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh,

415
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:39,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

416
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't have any of the new systems because I'm old school.

417
00:26:43,822 --> 00:26:46,404
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did play DR Universe, which is pretty cool.

418
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:52,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the license tracks on it, but the old school tracks that they pulled back, that they brought back, I don't know.

419
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:54,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was the best selection.

420
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they've kind of already pulled a lot back in the other Xbox games, right?

421
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:58,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

422
00:26:58,593 --> 00:27:00,515
[SPEAKER_03]: So they kind of, you know, they didn't want to repeat, so.

423
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:01,215
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

424
00:27:01,235 --> 00:27:03,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was kind of cool they got Hot Limit back.

425
00:27:04,437 --> 00:27:05,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Eh, gay.

426
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,020
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

427
00:27:09,272 --> 00:27:13,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, going to chat, I'm trying to see what's being talked about previously there.

428
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:21,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people were kind of taken back by the True Kiss Destination, or True Kiss TKD reference I made earlier in the show.

429
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:25,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And then somebody had to explain the DDR games that only came out in Japan.

430
00:27:27,802 --> 00:27:31,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, it looks like there's controversy brewing over Rondo of Blood in chat.

431
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:34,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see.

432
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Firebomb wants to know, why do I keep hearing aim noises in the background?

433
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:40,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Jamie's chatting while the show's going on.

434
00:27:42,063 --> 00:27:42,824
[SPEAKER_03]: You got busted.

435
00:27:43,605 --> 00:27:49,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I always have it open just like for only one person who is listening to the show, by the way.

436
00:27:50,012 --> 00:27:52,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can keep in touch with Tiara.

437
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:52,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

438
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:52,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

439
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty, well, now that we've gone over all our gaming weeks, we're going to start getting into some gaming news.

440
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,522
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, some housekeeping.

441
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:01,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Housekeeping this week.

442
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:07,766
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, we want to say a big thank you and hug, hug, kiss, kiss to PSP Fanboy, who profiled us on their site this week.

443
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:13,228
[SPEAKER_03]: They, you know, posted like, hey, this is a cool show that you should download.

444
00:28:13,428 --> 00:28:14,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's called RSS This.

445
00:28:15,242 --> 00:28:15,762
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

446
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:48,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bad feeling this guy listened to the episode where if you go back a couple episodes, DarkSakura and Chris were making those jokes back at each other where DarkSakura and Chris were joking that they were going to go off and have sex.

447
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:52,169
[SPEAKER_03]: So that made me kind of laugh.

448
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:55,630
[SPEAKER_03]: So I replied and I was like, actually, she's married.

449
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,611
[SPEAKER_03]: You may not have caught that.

450
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:00,912
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have downloaded the show where she was flirting with lesbians.

451
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:05,434
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's just a cool girl who doesn't really – sexuality is whatever.

452
00:29:05,934 --> 00:29:06,114
[SPEAKER_03]: So –

453
00:29:07,641 --> 00:29:08,062
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

454
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:12,003
[SPEAKER_03]: So they corrected the thing, but they still liked the show.

455
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:13,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I like boobs.

456
00:29:14,064 --> 00:29:15,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

457
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:16,245
[SPEAKER_03]: You're cool.

458
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:17,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

459
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:24,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what it boils down to, it's not that you're necessarily straight or you're a lesbian.

460
00:29:24,288 --> 00:29:25,008
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just a slut.

461
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:26,009
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not.

462
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:26,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

463
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:27,129
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not.

464
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only slept with one person ever.

465
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:30,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

466
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:31,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying this right now.

467
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:33,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in a monogamous relationship.

468
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:37,077
[SPEAKER_08]: with my very first and only Soha.

469
00:29:37,518 --> 00:29:39,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And you still can look at boobs.

470
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,981
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with that.

471
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:41,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Because boobs are hot and squishy.

472
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:42,305
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

473
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:44,668
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

474
00:29:45,068 --> 00:29:47,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, a couple other quick housekeeping things.

475
00:29:47,712 --> 00:29:51,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to point out over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com and our forums.

476
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:54,297
[SPEAKER_03]: We've opened up our feedback threads a little early now.

477
00:29:54,617 --> 00:30:05,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way, those of you guys that are listening live, A, if you're too chicken to join the chat room at chat.orange.radio.com, you can post in our forum your live feedback as the show is going.

478
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:08,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, it's a good way for folks that are listening live if they're in a chat room.

479
00:30:09,364 --> 00:30:14,186
[SPEAKER_03]: If they had a favorite topic or quote or some funny moment that they wanted to document, that can go in the thread.

480
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:21,348
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really good in helping us to write our synopsis, what you guys liked, because then we kind of know what to feature in the show because you guys say you liked it.

481
00:30:21,408 --> 00:30:22,488
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a little thing there.

482
00:30:23,468 --> 00:30:24,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we want to mention this.

483
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:29,790
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't directly have to do with us, but we're kind of throwing our support behind it, shall we say.

484
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:35,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, if you didn't already know, Orange Lounge Radio is rebroadcast on a network called All Games.

485
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:37,702
[SPEAKER_03]: All games is trying to build this community type thing.

486
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:08,802
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like Myspace, but without the suck.

487
00:31:09,082 --> 00:31:13,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Myspace is as nice as it is, and you get a lot of attention there and everything.

488
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:22,590
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with Myspace is that, I don't know about you guys, but I'm getting all these cam girls and sluts and hey, cam guys and everything that are trying to add me on there.

489
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to filter out all this spam and crap to get through Myspace.

490
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:35,095
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess all games found this other service called Ning that allows you to create your own social network without all the freaking ads and all that stuff.

491
00:31:35,475 --> 00:31:36,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty cool.

492
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:42,660
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have your own blog on there and talk about stuff and then the blogs go to the front page and you can add your own videos and all that stuff.

493
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,401
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty cool.

494
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:44,565
[SPEAKER_03]: www.comunity.allgames.com

495
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:04,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's it for housekeeping.

496
00:32:31,605 --> 00:32:33,326
[SPEAKER_03]: We will get into some game news now.

497
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:35,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's starting us off tonight?

498
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe that would be me.

499
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:39,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

500
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:45,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for all five of us who have PlayStation 3s, we have something to look forward to.

501
00:32:45,492 --> 00:32:56,157
[SPEAKER_08]: The firmware is being updated to 1.54 that will add a video chat feature so that we can, I guess, watch naked people and sweaty fanboys on the other side.

502
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:59,018
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's our screen format, hey, that'd be great.

503
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:18,272
[SPEAKER_08]: and if you've also, this of course is more going to go toward any of the UK listeners, but if you've imported your PS3, you'd go into the system menu and update via the internet or you can download the firmware from the US or Japanese support sites.

504
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:21,834
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually have to pay 20 bucks for it.

505
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:29,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, 20 bucks for Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection over in the UK, that would be $6.99.

506
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:35,312
[SPEAKER_08]: and, um, that's really the only differences I'm seeing coming up with that.

507
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:36,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't download that either.

508
00:33:37,494 --> 00:33:43,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, eh, no, 20, 20 some dollars is too much for me to pay for a game.

509
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wait a minute.

510
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,021
[SPEAKER_02]: That you download.

511
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:52,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, you paid like 60 bucks for, yeah, but there's a big difference between like Tekken and Dig Dug.

512
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:54,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also not a, I'm not a Tekken fan.

513
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:56,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I would download it.

514
00:33:56,188 --> 00:33:58,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really a fighting game fan either.

515
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:05,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Tekken is worth $600, which is essentially what you're going to try to sell me on because I still don't have a PlayStation 3.

516
00:34:05,895 --> 00:34:08,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And Flow, I still haven't gotten Flow.

517
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,917
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I have trouble paying $8.

518
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:11,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mean After Dark, the game?

519
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:12,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

520
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,761
[SPEAKER_03]: They should put toasters in there.

521
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:15,762
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be even better.

522
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:16,342
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be fun.

523
00:34:17,311 --> 00:34:18,272
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

524
00:34:40,051 --> 00:34:42,732
[SPEAKER_03]: and put it on Xbox Live Market... Whoops.

525
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:44,593
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation Network.

526
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,094
[SPEAKER_03]: See where my mind goes?

527
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:48,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even realize there's a PlayStation Network.

528
00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:49,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have Lasers 3.

529
00:34:50,196 --> 00:34:53,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if Xbox beats them to it, that's the nail in Sony's coffin.

530
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:55,318
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

531
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:56,159
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a race now.

532
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,479
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the real Next Gen Wars.

533
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Who will obtain Laser Cats the game?

534
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:03,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that will be the victor of the Next Gen Wars.

535
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:07,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, not necessarily adding lasers to cats is a good idea.

536
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:08,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for example...

537
00:35:09,465 --> 00:35:10,646
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

538
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:40,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Future updates getting some upscaling for your DVDs.

539
00:35:40,787 --> 00:35:50,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is I think a feature that's already on the Xbox 360 and it's already on Blu-ray players out there.

540
00:35:50,194 --> 00:35:53,777
[SPEAKER_02]: At least some of the Sony ones and I think some of the other ones out there.

541
00:35:55,338 --> 00:35:57,860
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's something that's going to be coming later on.

542
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know...

543
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:03,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Normal DVDs upscaled look pretty good.

544
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:07,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Not exactly going to be as great as content that was made for that resolution.

545
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:10,233
[SPEAKER_02]: But, hey, something's better than nothing.

546
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather have my DVDs look a little bit better.

547
00:36:14,655 --> 00:36:15,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray!

548
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that's in the update other than video chat, because guess what?

549
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:22,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any friends on the PlayStation Network, so video chat is kind of useless to me.

550
00:36:22,418 --> 00:36:24,039
[SPEAKER_03]: You have no friends on the PlayStation Network?

551
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I have Bobby on there, and that's about it.

552
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,940
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the only friend on my friends list.

553
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Bobby's your only friend?

554
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:35,809
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't even play online, really, with the PS3.

555
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:39,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never played Resistance online, which I really need to do because it's supposed to be pretty good.

556
00:36:40,391 --> 00:36:48,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Motorstorm, which this week we're going to have that, and maybe I'll play that online, but Motorstorm is not two-player split-screen.

557
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:49,816
[SPEAKER_02]: That fucking sucks.

558
00:36:50,437 --> 00:36:52,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hell can't they do split-screen games anymore?

559
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:55,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just too graphic intensive?

560
00:36:55,057 --> 00:36:58,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're essentially having to render the two things at once.

561
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would think that the cell processor could handle that.

562
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:02,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

563
00:37:02,483 --> 00:37:03,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, shit.

564
00:37:03,924 --> 00:37:06,606
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be able to reconstruct my DNA.

565
00:37:06,806 --> 00:37:08,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the cell is awesome, right?

566
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so upscaling DVDs.

567
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the cell processor should be able to do that.

568
00:37:16,232 --> 00:37:16,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.

569
00:37:17,814 --> 00:37:18,114
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

570
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:19,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

571
00:37:19,535 --> 00:37:22,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Going on to the chat room and kind of looking at what's going on in chat.

572
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:23,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

573
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:27,080
[SPEAKER_03]: TheRobD was correcting me from earlier and said it's actually not $600.

574
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,400
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $599 US dollars.

575
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, but you forgot tax and all that other crap they throw in there.

576
00:37:34,181 --> 00:37:34,161
$599.99.

577
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:36,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

578
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:36,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

579
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:38,902
[SPEAKER_03]: HolyShonen says, Aw, poor Loki.

580
00:37:38,962 --> 00:37:40,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby, his only friend.

581
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:43,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rama says, Loki is the Charlie Brown of Orange Lounge Radio.

582
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:48,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to give out your username so that other listeners can take pity on you and you can have more than one friend?

583
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:50,324
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just Loki space O-L-R.

584
00:37:50,724 --> 00:37:51,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

585
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:51,464
[SPEAKER_02]: On the

586
00:37:52,783 --> 00:37:56,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's just no one has PlayStation 3s.

587
00:37:56,664 --> 00:37:57,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one.

588
00:37:57,704 --> 00:37:59,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Why aren't you guys friends?

589
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:02,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you don't like Loki?

590
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she doesn't play her PlayStation 3.

591
00:38:04,146 --> 00:38:04,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I do.

592
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:05,947
[SPEAKER_08]: I played it all day today.

593
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:07,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I sold one of my PlayStation 3 games.

594
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:09,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I sold Full Auto 2 finally.

595
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:12,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still keeping Ridge Racer 7 just for the fuck of it.

596
00:38:12,268 --> 00:38:13,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's Ridge Racer.

597
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:14,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

598
00:38:15,149 --> 00:38:18,310
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ridge Racer 6 in new packaging for the PlayStation 3.

599
00:38:20,351 --> 00:38:21,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying Ridge Racer 8.

600
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Hear me now, Namco.

601
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:32,538
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to change more than just... Look, the cars are a little bit more shiny, and the tracks are a little bit more shiny.

602
00:38:32,618 --> 00:38:37,302
[SPEAKER_03]: What if Ridge Racer 8 allowed you to select Toons as the driving cat as a driver?

603
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:38,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you then buy Ridge Racer 8?

604
00:38:39,244 --> 00:38:39,765
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wouldn't.

605
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:44,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, if Ridge Racer 8 had tons of sluts everywhere, then maybe.

606
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,171
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they'd need.

607
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:48,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't rolling my eyes, I was popping my neck

608
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, this is what they need.

609
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:12,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Ridge Racer, it doesn't really stand out.

610
00:39:12,254 --> 00:39:12,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

611
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:18,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Need for Speed and fucking Juiced and stuff are kind of getting a little bit better.

612
00:39:19,218 --> 00:39:22,880
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, more women could never hurt.

613
00:39:25,682 --> 00:39:28,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know if there'd be anything in that for me.

614
00:39:29,464 --> 00:39:29,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

615
00:39:29,804 --> 00:39:30,605
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't play Ridge Racer.

616
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:33,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireboma says Ridge Racer ate sluts everywhere

617
00:39:59,389 --> 00:40:01,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Canogram gives the mandatory LOL sluts.

618
00:40:02,993 --> 00:40:05,716
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says Ridge Racer Extreme Beach Volleyball.

619
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:06,576
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

620
00:40:06,977 --> 00:40:10,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bobby Blackwolf just joined chat going, did someone say my name?

621
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:17,888
[SPEAKER_03]: To which Rob D promptly responded, it's Loki's only friend, Blackwolf.

622
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:29,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to put the patent down on this Ridge Racer 8?

623
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:33,320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because they'll never do it.

624
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:41,202
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still making weird... They still think that fucking Peanuts is a valuable franchise to them.

625
00:40:41,262 --> 00:40:42,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

626
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:47,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I wanted to pull up here.

627
00:40:47,883 --> 00:40:52,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have... I overheard Blackwolf and...

628
00:40:53,254 --> 00:40:57,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki talking earlier, and I actually found the theme song of their relationship, so here it is.

629
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:03,379
Haven't you ever heard this song in your life?

630
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,140
Never mind.

631
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:04,720
Okay.

632
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,061
Joke gone wrong.

633
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:27,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Also something that went way wrong earlier this week was the relationship between Kotaku and Sony.

634
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:33,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely if you've been anywhere on the internet this week on game blogs you've heard about this whole fiasco.

635
00:41:33,797 --> 00:41:42,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically Kotaku published this rumor and the rumor is that PlayStation is going to be unveiling the PlayStation Home at Game Developers Conference.

636
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:48,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you get to make an avatar for your console, like a Mii, and this avatar has a room.

637
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:55,718
[SPEAKER_03]: As you play games and accomplish certain tasks, you will receive items with which to adorn the room that are specific to the game.

638
00:41:55,818 --> 00:41:56,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Achievements.

639
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,142
[SPEAKER_03]: The kicker is that this is going to be a new requirement for every PlayStation 3 game.

640
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:01,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome!

641
00:42:01,742 --> 00:42:03,463
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation is doing something right.

642
00:42:03,703 --> 00:42:07,785
[SPEAKER_03]: They are ripping off some of the best parts of Nintendo and Microsoft, which is what they need to do.

643
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:08,526
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

644
00:42:08,646 --> 00:42:09,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody rips each other off.

645
00:42:10,006 --> 00:42:12,548
[SPEAKER_03]: They're ripping off the Wii's and Animal Crossing from Nintendo.

646
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:17,910
[SPEAKER_03]: They're ripping off the achievements from Xbox 360 and making a more dynamic online service to compete with them.

647
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:18,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Great!

648
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:20,331
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds like a wonderful thing.

649
00:42:20,612 --> 00:42:22,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly this couldn't be bad press.

650
00:42:22,392 --> 00:42:24,093
[SPEAKER_03]: This is good news for Sony for once.

651
00:42:24,453 --> 00:42:25,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does Sony do?

652
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:27,615
[SPEAKER_03]: They fuck it up with bad press.

653
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:39,871
[SPEAKER_03]: because suddenly, like, not even five minutes after this rumor goes up, Kotaku gets this huge, you done fucked up letter from Sony, essentially, and so many, I don't have the letter in front of me, but essentially it said,

654
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:50,423
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a bad person for running that story, therefore you're uninvited from our press conferences, we want you to send the dev kit back, we're slapping you on the wrist, blah blah blah.

655
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:59,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the equivalent of playing Monopoly with somebody who's losing, and they throw the board up in the air and say, fuck this game, I'm taking my board home.

656
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:01,767
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically what happened, yes?

657
00:43:01,827 --> 00:43:02,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair to say?

658
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:08,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and they're worried about negative press from the story, and yet...

659
00:43:10,282 --> 00:43:16,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this catches wildfire, you know, because everybody's like, what the hell did Kotaku do wrong?

660
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:22,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only did they pretty much prove this rumor to be true, I mean, come on, is there any way this rumor could not be true?

661
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:26,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that and the fact that they've also registered trademarks for PlayStation Homes.

662
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:34,561
[SPEAKER_03]: All they had to do was just... We do not comment on rumors.

663
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:39,706
[SPEAKER_03]: If Sony had kept their mouths shut, they could have still had somewhat of a surprise at Game Developers Conference.

664
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:45,813
[SPEAKER_03]: But from this happening, did they not think, oh, well, if we're gonna, you know, slap Kotaku's wrist...

665
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:49,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think they're probably going to blog about it since obviously Sony doesn't care about them anymore?

666
00:43:49,865 --> 00:43:52,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the other thing that I think is kind of bad.

667
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:53,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me say real quick.

668
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:57,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously the rest of the story is the rest of the internet banded behind Kotaku.

669
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:58,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It got on Dig.

670
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:05,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Even other blogs like Destructoid changed their title banner to basically say like Brian Crescente has the biggest balls in the world, something like that.

671
00:44:06,834 --> 00:44:15,378
[SPEAKER_03]: The entire internet's jumping behind what Kotaku did and Sony got its tail between its legs now, has to go

672
00:44:16,118 --> 00:44:17,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we made a mistake.

673
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Kotaku, can we play nice again?

674
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:21,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And they made up.

675
00:44:21,082 --> 00:44:21,802
[SPEAKER_02]: They kissed and made up.

676
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:23,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the whole thing.

677
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:25,605
[SPEAKER_02]: The big focus wasn't about this whole story.

678
00:44:25,785 --> 00:44:33,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that Sony was trying to dictate to a blog what stories they could post and what they can't.

679
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:35,032
[SPEAKER_02]: They're reporting on stuff.

680
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:35,512
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not...

681
00:44:36,397 --> 00:44:36,937
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

682
00:44:56,147 --> 00:44:57,448
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't quite go their way.

683
00:44:57,608 --> 00:45:03,511
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they thought, oh, big bad Sony's going to make a huff and puff and they're going to just be like, oh, okay, we'll take the story down then.

684
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:08,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma says, Sky, the whole Kotaku Sony thing was a damn publicity stunt.

685
00:45:09,114 --> 00:45:09,534
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

686
00:45:09,995 --> 00:45:10,295
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

687
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:12,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the evidence to back that up?

688
00:45:12,256 --> 00:45:12,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

689
00:45:12,836 --> 00:45:13,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not publicity.

690
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was just being stupid.

691
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:22,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't Sony use their own, what is it, three, three something, what is that, three, that site they have.

692
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:23,282
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called like 3D.

693
00:45:25,242 --> 00:45:27,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep thinking of Frogger 2, 3, Deep.

694
00:45:27,544 --> 00:45:28,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

695
00:45:28,445 --> 00:45:29,666
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have... Yes.

696
00:45:29,706 --> 00:45:30,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

697
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Blog site's called Frogger 2, 3.

698
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I have said anything more random?

699
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,493
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some site, 3 something, that shows how much we care.

700
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:36,853
[SPEAKER_03]: 3Play.

701
00:45:36,953 --> 00:45:37,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

702
00:45:37,854 --> 00:45:38,995
[SPEAKER_03]: You knew that the whole time.

703
00:45:39,056 --> 00:45:40,497
[SPEAKER_03]: You just wanted to watch me struggle.

704
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,519
[SPEAKER_03]: They had 3Play or whatever.

705
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:43,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help, I know...

706
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:09,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

707
00:46:09,959 --> 00:46:11,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, I guess, that they're doing this.

708
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

709
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to buy more games, though, because of it.

710
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:15,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

711
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:22,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft was smart to do the achievements because I'm a sucker and I buy crappy games like Bullet Witch because of this shit.

712
00:46:22,903 --> 00:46:28,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And no matter how hard I try, I can't do that because I'm hooked like crack.

713
00:46:28,645 --> 00:46:32,506
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the PlayStation Network or whatever, great.

714
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:34,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I get crap for my virtual house now.

715
00:46:35,234 --> 00:46:36,014
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

716
00:46:36,314 --> 00:46:37,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show it to all my friends.

717
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:37,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait.

718
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:40,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby is my only friend on there, so great.

719
00:46:41,016 --> 00:46:42,116
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be awesome.

720
00:46:42,176 --> 00:46:44,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to show all my friend.

721
00:46:44,857 --> 00:46:48,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just stupid, though.

722
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:50,238
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't get it.

723
00:46:50,398 --> 00:46:58,281
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not because people are not buying a PlayStation 3 or going on their network service because there's no achievements or me's.

724
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:03,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because of $600, not because there's no me's.

725
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't go, oh wow, you know, there's me's on here now.

726
00:47:08,206 --> 00:47:10,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll spend $600 on a PlayStation 3.

727
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,114
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not the reason why people aren't buying your platform.

728
00:47:15,196 --> 00:47:16,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, you want to chime in?

729
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:18,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

730
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:24,283
[SPEAKER_03]: What if, let's say, PlayStation puts out a patch.

731
00:47:24,403 --> 00:47:26,345
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually do have an online version on that, by the way.

732
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:30,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say PlayStation comes out with a patch and all the old games get this too.

733
00:47:30,408 --> 00:47:34,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's relatively enough games out there where they could go back to all the old games and patch them.

734
00:47:35,371 --> 00:47:38,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's say you could get a Captain America shield in your house from playing.

735
00:47:39,074 --> 00:47:40,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be cool?

736
00:47:40,785 --> 00:47:41,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it would.

737
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:47,307
[SPEAKER_03]: But is that enough to be like a real robust feature that could sell the PlayStation 3?

738
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:49,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, hey, come over to my house.

739
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:51,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a Captain America shield.

740
00:47:51,408 --> 00:47:53,908
[SPEAKER_08]: My answer time.

741
00:47:53,988 --> 00:47:55,849
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a, hey, come over to my house.

742
00:47:55,909 --> 00:47:57,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a Captain America shield in it.

743
00:47:57,829 --> 00:48:08,552
[SPEAKER_02]: If it were like something where the whole environment was very like Animal Crossing where you can walk around and talk to people like this big online chat room almost with avatars.

744
00:48:09,073 --> 00:48:09,993
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be kind of cool.

745
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:10,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Which it could be.

746
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:13,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, it hasn't been officially announced yet.

747
00:48:13,235 --> 00:48:16,636
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was Browser the MMO or something, then that would be one.

748
00:48:16,976 --> 00:48:18,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's enough to sell the system.

749
00:48:18,577 --> 00:48:30,182
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what I think, is that I don't think it's $600 cool, but Sony badly needs something cute like this to kind of help their image, if that makes any sense.

750
00:48:30,563 --> 00:48:32,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, they really need something like this.

751
00:48:32,965 --> 00:48:34,425
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it boils down to the games.

752
00:48:34,586 --> 00:48:41,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they need something also to flesh out their network because right now their network's just kind of a clusterfuck of I don't know what's going on, you know?

753
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no downloadable content for the games.

754
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:48,454
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hardly any demos online.

755
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:51,416
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hardly any download content other than PlayStation 1 games.

756
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:52,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Great!

757
00:48:52,477 --> 00:48:53,357
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 1 games.

758
00:48:53,477 --> 00:48:55,859
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a PS3 to download games to my PSP.

759
00:48:56,179 --> 00:48:59,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, people have broke already so you can, you know...

760
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:03,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Copy them and completely pirate the shit.

761
00:49:03,913 --> 00:49:08,917
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like there's no motivation for me to go online with this thing.

762
00:49:10,298 --> 00:49:10,598
[SPEAKER_02]: At all.

763
00:49:10,918 --> 00:49:12,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sorry.

764
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:15,341
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just... Motorstorm's going to be a great game.

765
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:15,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

766
00:49:15,981 --> 00:49:21,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I should buy a PlayStation 3 just to be your friend and take pity on you.

767
00:49:21,565 --> 00:49:21,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I just...

768
00:49:22,273 --> 00:49:23,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel so bad for you and you're my friend.

769
00:49:24,013 --> 00:49:24,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

770
00:49:24,314 --> 00:49:25,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play my PlayStation 3.

771
00:49:25,794 --> 00:49:29,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I play my 360 and I've been playing the Wii a little bit, but mainly my 360.

772
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:34,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a time when I was playing Resistance, I'm like, well, I don't know when am I going to go back and play my 360.

773
00:49:34,956 --> 00:49:39,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it didn't take long, finished Resistance, and then there's no reason to play it anymore.

774
00:49:39,297 --> 00:49:45,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm back to playing my 360 where there's a bunch of new shit coming out, which is great, you know, but...

775
00:49:46,328 --> 00:49:49,171
[SPEAKER_02]: PlayStation 3 doesn't have anything really unique to it.

776
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:50,192
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything.

777
00:49:50,452 --> 00:49:54,036
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm going to get a game, I'm going to get it on the 360 because it has achievements.

778
00:49:55,057 --> 00:49:56,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Wolf's getting a little territorial.

779
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:59,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Wolf says, no, Sky, he's my friend.

780
00:49:59,302 --> 00:50:00,423
[SPEAKER_03]: You stay back, bitch.

781
00:50:02,785 --> 00:50:03,866
[SPEAKER_09]: You can add me and Dan.

782
00:50:03,886 --> 00:50:05,188
[SPEAKER_09]: We're on there as Gunstar Hero.

783
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:09,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Cue the scary music theme, single white female, whatever.

784
00:50:09,642 --> 00:50:15,105
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so definitely something that will continue to develop next week at Game Developers Conference when they actually announce it.

785
00:50:15,185 --> 00:50:17,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, sorry, it's supposed to be a rumor, but come on.

786
00:50:17,886 --> 00:50:19,107
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know it's probably true.

787
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:19,927
[SPEAKER_02]: It is true.

788
00:50:19,987 --> 00:50:22,369
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already registered the fucking trademarks for it.

789
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:23,509
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a logo for it.

790
00:50:24,089 --> 00:50:25,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out.

791
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:32,994
[SPEAKER_02]: They just didn't want it to look like that this was something that they thought up real quick or anything like, I don't know, the six-axis controller.

792
00:50:34,123 --> 00:51:01,618
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to know We always meant for that to have tilt control It wasn't like after we saw the Wii or anything that we decided to put this in here Could someone going to Game Developers Conference randomly shout out I love you Kotaku during the Sony press conference like after or before when everybody's coming in I would do it myself but I'm afraid of getting kicked out So I need someone with bigger balls I can't even go so I didn't get invited You can just go Is it free?

793
00:51:02,158 --> 00:51:03,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Well if you're a press, yes

794
00:51:04,408 --> 00:51:05,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you'd have to register, though.

795
00:51:05,949 --> 00:51:06,809
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it at the thing.

796
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:09,731
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do that.

797
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:10,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'll talk to you offline.

798
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:14,953
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

799
00:51:15,493 --> 00:51:18,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is a little bit more from Sony.

800
00:51:18,835 --> 00:51:24,097
[SPEAKER_08]: They have their launch lineup for the European PlayStation Network.

801
00:51:25,635 --> 00:51:54,362
[SPEAKER_08]: there will be a few downloads available on March 23rd Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection for £6.99 Blast Factor for £3.49 and Gran Turismo HD Trial for free other games that are set to come out is on the 30th Super Rub-a-Dub which is a duck 6th April Flow, 13th April Go Sudoku and 20th April Go Puzzle so there's just a few things

802
00:51:55,537 --> 00:52:08,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you noticed that a lot of their games that they make for the online network that use 6-axis tilt controls are just games where it's involving you shooting something or something in water that you tilt the thing around.

803
00:52:08,987 --> 00:52:13,570
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that the 6-axis is good for is fucking Etch-a-Sketch shit.

804
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,871
[SPEAKER_08]: For the record, I hate the 6-axis.

805
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:17,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually... I hate it.

806
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:18,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

807
00:52:19,774 --> 00:52:24,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you had to do shit with it on Marvel Ultimate Alliance and it's so fucking unwieldy.

808
00:52:24,938 --> 00:52:25,919
[SPEAKER_08]: It just isn't annoyance.

809
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:32,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that would be kind of funny as an extra sketch because you could use the analog sticks and the dials and then you could shake the controller to clear it.

810
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:33,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

811
00:52:33,524 --> 00:52:37,107
[SPEAKER_03]: They should make downloadable... But what if I had Parkinson's and I'd never be able to draw anything?

812
00:52:37,447 --> 00:52:39,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.

813
00:52:40,029 --> 00:52:40,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy that then.

814
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:42,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy a Wii.

815
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:43,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy a 360 then.

816
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:44,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I will.

817
00:52:44,352 --> 00:52:45,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And where the 360 will rumble for you.

818
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:48,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so...

819
00:52:50,558 --> 00:52:50,938
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.

820
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:15,805
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

821
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:53,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, you know, maybe they may announce something at Game Developers Conference, you know, that they're redesigning the PS3 or something like that, so.

822
00:53:54,049 --> 00:53:55,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Now in pretty colors.

823
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:56,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

824
00:53:57,191 --> 00:53:57,671
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

825
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:01,293
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be pretty smart to beat Nintendo to the market with that kind of crap.

826
00:54:01,493 --> 00:54:02,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Beat them at their own game?

827
00:54:02,693 --> 00:54:03,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

828
00:54:04,594 --> 00:54:08,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, unless they come out and say, now in pretty colors and $200 cheaper.

829
00:54:10,157 --> 00:54:11,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'm sold yet.

830
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:13,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

831
00:54:14,137 --> 00:54:18,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that might bring some people back to the PlayStation 3, including Hideo Kojima.

832
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:22,820
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can think back to an old story, I mean, yes, we all know Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming out on 360.

833
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:27,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get Microsoft out of my mind tonight.

834
00:54:27,442 --> 00:54:27,922
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?

835
00:54:28,282 --> 00:54:31,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Metal Gear Solid 4 is coming out on PlayStation 3.

836
00:54:32,784 --> 00:54:34,265
[SPEAKER_03]: But what did Kojima say he missed?

837
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble, right?

838
00:54:35,745 --> 00:54:37,486
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was an essential part of Metal Gear Solid.

839
00:54:37,546 --> 00:54:39,827
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, Rumble is not on the PlayStation 3.

840
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:39,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

841
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, Rumble could be coming back.

842
00:54:45,013 --> 00:54:50,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why we say could be is because Sony and Immersion have settled their patent litigation.

843
00:54:50,938 --> 00:54:52,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Think back in the past.

844
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Immersion sued Sony over the Rumble thing.

845
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:56,262
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually settled with Microsoft.

846
00:54:56,282 --> 00:55:03,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe Nintendo, they either settled or Nintendo had already worked it out with Immersion before they ever put it in there.

847
00:55:03,248 --> 00:55:04,549
[SPEAKER_03]: They worked it out with the other two companies.

848
00:55:04,569 --> 00:55:05,770
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you have Rumble and the 360 and the Wii.

849
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:07,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble is so last gen

850
00:55:25,445 --> 00:55:31,067
[SPEAKER_02]: The Edge on the competition, but really, they're just kind of trailing behind in ideas and innovation.

851
00:55:31,508 --> 00:55:31,988
[SPEAKER_02]: This time.

852
00:55:32,448 --> 00:55:34,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this time, I mean, well, all the time.

853
00:55:35,049 --> 00:55:35,909
[SPEAKER_02]: When have they been ahead?

854
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:38,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, okay, granted, they had a DVD drive and a PlayStation 2.

855
00:55:39,431 --> 00:55:41,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good for them.

856
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's good.

857
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:45,173
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of stuff on PlayStation 1 and 2 were a little bit ahead of time.

858
00:55:45,193 --> 00:55:48,055
[SPEAKER_02]: They were behind on the fucking, you know, rumble technology.

859
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:51,396
[SPEAKER_02]: They're behind on analog sticks on there, but...

860
00:55:52,842 --> 00:55:56,363
[SPEAKER_02]: and even the controller designs fucking copying off of the Super Nintendo.

861
00:55:56,423 --> 00:55:58,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

862
00:55:58,403 --> 00:55:59,984
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just playing the copycat game.

863
00:56:00,384 --> 00:56:02,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, they did it pretty well the last two gens.

864
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Well... Alright, well anyway.

865
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:08,406
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes this whole thing very interesting is what Kaz Hirai had to say after this whole thing.

866
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:15,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, We look forward to exploring with immersion exciting new ways to bring the largest and best range of gameplay experiences to our customers.

867
00:56:16,008 --> 00:56:22,089
[SPEAKER_03]: We are very excited about our new partnership with immersion and the potential for new and innovative products incorporating their technologies.

868
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, I gotta buy new controllers now, thank you very much.

869
00:56:26,942 --> 00:56:28,003
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I can trade them in.

870
00:56:30,484 --> 00:56:32,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, I guess is all I can say.

871
00:56:32,105 --> 00:56:45,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not even like three days ago, someone over at Sony, I don't remember who said it, but somebody at Sony said, it was probably that crazy guy from Sony Europe, Phil Harrison, I think he was the one that said, Rumble is so last gen.

872
00:56:50,740 --> 00:57:16,683
[SPEAKER_08]: and now things seem to change on a dime yet again well we do though anything in this industry though does change pretty crazy including release dates however I have a fairly decent list for our UK listeners so starting with the releases on the 5th which would be tomorrow for us actually it's the 5th there already

873
00:57:17,205 --> 00:57:19,447
[SPEAKER_08]: is a Wario Master of Disguise in the DS.

874
00:57:19,927 --> 00:57:42,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming up on the 9th is Bullet Witch, Castlevania Portrait of Ruin, Garfield's Nightmare, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories, Luminous Plus, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2, March of the Minis, Rogue Galaxy, Runaway 2, The Dream of the Turtle, Silverfall, The Household Detroit Streets, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2, and Trackmania United on PC.

875
00:57:43,645 --> 00:57:43,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

876
00:57:45,088 --> 00:58:12,994
[SPEAKER_02]: we actually have a pretty good week as far as release dates in the United States definitely some good stuff especially one of my favorites coming to the Playstation 2 Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories for the whopping cheap price of $19.99 so you should definitely check it out of course I don't think there's going to be multiplayer in there so that kind of sucks Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 for the 360 and the PC Def Jam Icon for Playstation 3 and the 360 that should be pretty cool

877
00:58:13,815 --> 00:58:25,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Titan Quest Immortal Throne Motor Storm Wario Master of Disguise Rayman's Raving Rabbids Shrek's Smashing Crash Racing Burnout Dominator PlayStation 2 and the PSP Tortuga Two Treasures

878
00:58:44,141 --> 00:58:44,541
[SPEAKER_02]: VIRTUA TENNIS

879
00:59:13,479 --> 00:59:15,320
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's coming out on March the 8th.

880
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:22,166
[SPEAKER_03]: On some other systems, over on the Nintendo Wii, Bomberman Land Wii is coming out on March 8th.

881
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:23,587
[SPEAKER_03]: See, this is why I like doing this segment.

882
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:26,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know they were making a freaking Bomberman game for the Wii, so there you have it.

883
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully much better than Bomberman Act Zero.

884
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:32,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully they don't take Bomberman into the future.

885
00:59:33,054 --> 00:59:33,815
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.

886
00:59:34,535 --> 00:59:40,760
[SPEAKER_03]: A game called iShield 21 from Nintendo is actually coming out over in Japan this week as well.

887
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,281
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like...

888
00:59:42,295 --> 00:59:44,716
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it could be a fighting game or something.

889
00:59:44,736 --> 00:59:45,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure exactly what this is.

890
00:59:47,236 --> 00:59:49,757
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually more of an action game, it looks like.

891
00:59:50,377 --> 00:59:52,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to see what some of the screenshots look like.

892
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,838
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it has a bunch of different modes in it there.

893
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:57,338
[SPEAKER_03]: You kick a ball in one mode as a football player.

894
00:59:58,158 --> 01:00:00,359
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like another one you throw a football.

895
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:05,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might be an amateur Olympics type of game.

896
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,300
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

897
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe someone in chat will pipe up who knows more about that game.

898
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:11,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?

899
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:14,039
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's called Eyeshield 21.

900
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,141
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an anime-based football game, I think.

901
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:19,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

902
01:00:19,302 --> 01:00:20,082
[SPEAKER_02]: If I remember correctly.

903
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:24,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, I guess, Imagine Madden, but with fictional football characters.

904
01:00:24,745 --> 01:00:25,245
[SPEAKER_02]: They're anime.

905
01:00:26,266 --> 01:00:26,546
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

906
01:00:27,407 --> 01:00:35,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming out on the PlayStation 2, you have Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania Masterpiece Gold coming out over in Japan.

907
01:00:36,072 --> 01:00:37,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Used to import all those Guitar Freaks games.

908
01:00:37,773 --> 01:00:38,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, are you going to get this one?

909
01:00:39,114 --> 01:00:39,274
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

910
01:00:39,294 --> 01:00:39,334
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

911
01:00:39,935 --> 01:00:41,036
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

912
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:02,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Kenka Banshu 2 Full Throttle Doraemon

913
01:01:29,125 --> 01:01:35,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Doraemon Nobita no Shin Maki Daibouken Dragon Sakura DS EQ Trainer DS Puzzle Series

914
01:01:51,716 --> 01:01:55,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Second Detsetsu Heroes of Mana coming out from Square Enix.

915
01:01:56,402 --> 01:01:59,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And I imagine that would be the next Mana game that we're going to get over here.

916
01:02:00,146 --> 01:02:01,568
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting Dawn of Mana next.

917
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:03,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's probably the same thing, just a different name.

918
01:02:04,251 --> 01:02:09,738
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, of course, speculation from someone who has not done their research on what exactly that game is.

919
01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:11,836
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

920
01:02:26,384 --> 01:02:32,986
[SPEAKER_02]: and that game Spelling Spree which was being released by Ubisoft is now known as Wordplay.

921
01:02:33,546 --> 01:02:36,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess they thought Spelling Spree was retarded as a name.

922
01:02:37,267 --> 01:02:41,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to thank everyone in chatroom who was yelling at me over what Eyeshield 21 is.

923
01:02:41,689 --> 01:02:44,849
[SPEAKER_03]: You all watch far more Japanese import animation than I do.

924
01:02:45,010 --> 01:02:45,490
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

925
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:47,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking football, dumbass!

926
01:02:49,311 --> 01:02:49,851
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

927
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Rob, you should know better.

928
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:55,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, did you know what it was?

929
01:02:55,268 --> 01:02:56,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say anything to try to correct me?

930
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:59,632
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I like seeing you flounder.

931
01:02:59,812 --> 01:03:00,272
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a bitch.

932
01:03:01,013 --> 01:03:02,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, so.

933
01:03:02,794 --> 01:03:16,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, speaking of bitchy things, you know, at least things that are going to have other companies bitching, it has been speculated that the Wii is going to outsell the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 through 2008.

934
01:03:19,747 --> 01:03:31,076
[SPEAKER_08]: The market research firm IDC has basically stated that they believe the hardware shipments of the Wii will capture more than a third of the worldwide market by 2008.

935
01:03:31,477 --> 01:03:35,680
[SPEAKER_08]: And it will rise above the PS3 and Xbox 360.

936
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:39,903
[SPEAKER_03]: In related news, I still don't give a shit what an analyst has to say.

937
01:03:41,365 --> 01:03:43,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's already proving, though, to be that way.

938
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:45,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, look at how it's performing.

939
01:03:45,668 --> 01:03:47,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you that, but I get so sick of these

940
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Analyst says this.

941
01:03:50,101 --> 01:03:51,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Stories making it to blogs.

942
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:54,522
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm not talking about any stories with analysts.

943
01:03:54,562 --> 01:03:56,343
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's catching a lot of news and what have you.

944
01:03:56,463 --> 01:03:57,363
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

945
01:03:57,383 --> 01:04:00,324
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole reason I thought that it was relevant is because it is happening.

946
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:01,984
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that we actually see happening.

947
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:02,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you that.

948
01:04:02,584 --> 01:04:05,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like we had this week as well.

949
01:04:05,665 --> 01:04:08,286
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another analyst that said that the PlayStation 3 is going to take over by 2010.

950
01:04:08,346 --> 01:04:11,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there was another analyst that says the Wii is going to take over.

951
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:13,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there was another analyst that says the 360 is going to take over.

952
01:04:14,147 --> 01:04:15,769
[SPEAKER_02]: We need someone to analyze the analysts.

953
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:16,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what that means?

954
01:04:17,251 --> 01:04:18,472
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crap information.

955
01:04:19,013 --> 01:04:21,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Your guess is as good as their guess.

956
01:04:21,576 --> 01:04:22,838
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about this guess?

957
01:04:22,878 --> 01:04:25,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually kind of agree with it.

958
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:33,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that we will continue to outpace 360 and PlayStation 3 just based on the reactions of people I see who aren't gamers.

959
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:44,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, keep in mind, Cars was one of the top-selling games last year, not thanks to any hardcore gamer who reads the blogs and thinks that that's the whole gaming world right there in that bubble.

960
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:48,672
[SPEAKER_03]: The casual gamer is what's going to push the Wii, I believe, ahead of those other two systems.

961
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:50,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

962
01:04:50,913 --> 01:04:55,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the 360, there's going to be some great games coming out.

963
01:04:55,216 --> 01:04:56,877
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit slow in the beginning of the year.

964
01:04:57,377 --> 01:04:59,718
[SPEAKER_02]: January, there's Lost Planet coming out, Bell.

965
01:04:59,919 --> 01:05:00,359
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

966
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:02,240
[SPEAKER_02]: January, there's two games for the...

967
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:07,640
[SPEAKER_02]: 3.60, most people were still picking up the Wii's because they couldn't get a hold of them at, you know, launch.

968
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:15,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just, you know, right now, I think, I think by the end of this year, I still think the 360's going to be beating the crap out of the Wii.

969
01:05:15,523 --> 01:05:18,264
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't really hear people talking about Lost Planet anymore.

970
01:05:18,284 --> 01:05:18,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

971
01:05:18,644 --> 01:05:20,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet I still hear people talking about Wii Sports.

972
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:25,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's because people are simpletons and they like Wii Sports.

973
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:26,967
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, big deal.

974
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:32,209
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people are picking up Wii Play not because of Wii Play, but because it came with another controller.

975
01:05:33,169 --> 01:05:35,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's just not putting out enough product.

976
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:42,793
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I had a story here real quick that Nintendo is slow to resupply retailers with brand new Wii's.

977
01:05:43,353 --> 01:05:44,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can attest to that.

978
01:05:44,714 --> 01:05:50,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Distribution for the month of March is being cut out of their replenishment cycles.

979
01:05:50,856 --> 01:05:53,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, Nintendo has said, guess what?

980
01:05:53,738 --> 01:05:57,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Distributors out there, you're not getting any new Wii's for the month of March.

981
01:05:57,159 --> 01:06:00,521
[SPEAKER_02]: We're giving them all to retailers because we can't make enough.

982
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:01,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

983
01:06:02,305 --> 01:06:14,661
[SPEAKER_02]: They right now are having a problem with production, and I think they just need to pump out as many systems, but eventually it's going to plateau once all those people that were waiting to get one finally get one.

984
01:06:14,761 --> 01:06:15,802
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now there's...

985
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:26,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I mean, Super Paper Mario coming out in April, but there's not any real big games announced that have definite dates yet, other than, you know, the fall.

986
01:06:26,545 --> 01:06:28,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's going to just plateau.

987
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:32,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's the DS drought all over again, despite what Mr. Fils-Aimé said previously.

988
01:06:32,569 --> 01:06:33,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seriously.

989
01:06:33,209 --> 01:06:37,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Party's been delayed to whenever, at least summer.

990
01:06:37,811 --> 01:06:40,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, there's really a lot of crappy games coming out.

991
01:06:40,993 --> 01:06:43,334
[SPEAKER_02]: But Zelda Ocarina of Time on Virtual Console.

992
01:06:43,555 --> 01:06:44,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Fap, fap, fap.

993
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:46,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody, great.

994
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:47,371
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

995
01:06:48,192 --> 01:06:51,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Virtual console, totally the reason why you should buy a Wii.

996
01:06:52,154 --> 01:06:57,857
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of, you have to admit, for some, again, casual gamers, that kind of appeals to them.

997
01:06:58,397 --> 01:07:00,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, great, but I don't think it's going to sell systems, though.

998
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:09,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, really, right now, people saw, like, WarioWare, and it was a lot of fun, and they're seeing some of the games coming out probably in March, but...

999
01:07:10,366 --> 01:07:13,528
[SPEAKER_02]: There is going to be a drought, and I think that's going to plateau off.

1000
01:07:13,689 --> 01:07:20,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the 360, if they have as big of a month as they're planning to in May, it's going to keep going.

1001
01:07:21,055 --> 01:07:24,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think with Game Developer Conference, there's going to be some major announcements.

1002
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:31,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually, especially with November, we're just going to see it take off again, with Halo 3 especially.

1003
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:33,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

1004
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:46,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to both these topics here, Gaming Nerd in chat says, By 2010, none of these consoles are going to be good since the next gen will be here and some console will get released a year before the rest.

1005
01:07:47,661 --> 01:07:48,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

1006
01:07:49,003 --> 01:07:53,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, also talking about JV Mon says, Who the fuck cares about Ocarina?

1007
01:07:54,167 --> 01:07:58,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much because I think Ocarina is one of the most overhyped games ever.

1008
01:07:58,451 --> 01:07:59,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Ocarina of Time.

1009
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:00,813
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of my favorite games.

1010
01:08:00,953 --> 01:08:01,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

1011
01:08:02,392 --> 01:08:03,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it!

1012
01:08:03,253 --> 01:08:04,233
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of my favorite games.

1013
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:11,058
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's certain websites out there that review some of these Zelda games, and because it's Zelda, they give it a 10 out of 10.

1014
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:27,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Not saying which websites, but I saw that and rolled my eyes and go, well, I kind of figured you'd do this, seeing as you've got a big hard-on over fucking Twilight Princess, which, I might add, it's a great game, but it's not perfect.

1015
01:08:27,188 --> 01:08:29,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have a hard-on over Twilight Princess, actually.

1016
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:29,990
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't...

1017
01:08:30,797 --> 01:08:33,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't fucking, you know, the greatest thing on Earth.

1018
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen way better, and... But, actually, it was pretty good.

1019
01:08:40,345 --> 01:08:45,069
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, no, I don't think... For me, Ocarina was no Link to the Past.

1020
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:46,090
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my problem.

1021
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:49,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Call me a 2D gamer, whatever, but that was my problem, was Ocarina was no Link to the Past.

1022
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:52,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, so, whatever.

1023
01:08:52,756 --> 01:08:54,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Controversial viewpoint, sorry, what can I say?

1024
01:08:55,218 --> 01:08:58,421
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we love to have here on this show, are controversial viewpoints.

1025
01:08:59,349 --> 01:09:04,190
[SPEAKER_03]: What we also love on this show are other little bits of retro goodness, and this always makes me squee.

1026
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:09,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And I notice Rice Princess is here joining us now, so say hello to the fanboys and girls.

1027
01:09:09,551 --> 01:09:10,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess?

1028
01:09:10,872 --> 01:09:11,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1029
01:09:11,932 --> 01:09:12,592
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing this week?

1030
01:09:13,312 --> 01:09:13,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of tired.

1031
01:09:14,673 --> 01:09:15,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear that.

1032
01:09:15,153 --> 01:09:16,993
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to nap on the ground there while we do the show?

1033
01:09:17,593 --> 01:09:18,234
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's filthy.

1034
01:09:19,134 --> 01:09:19,394
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1035
01:09:20,706 --> 01:09:33,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you remember this game, Rice Princess, but coming to the Wii from System 3, we've talked about this previously on the show, but we have some box art now for Impossible Mission coming out to the Wii.

1036
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:35,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you freaking joking?

1037
01:09:35,134 --> 01:09:35,915
[SPEAKER_07]: This is awesome.

1038
01:09:36,415 --> 01:09:37,015
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not.

1039
01:09:37,095 --> 01:09:43,299
[SPEAKER_03]: This is news that just makes you want to shout, ah.

1040
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:45,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more like, another visitor.

1041
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay a while.

1042
01:09:46,621 --> 01:09:47,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay forever.

1043
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:48,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's going to get that.

1044
01:09:49,505 --> 01:09:52,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, Impossible Mission, if you can believe it, came out 25 years ago.

1045
01:09:52,648 --> 01:09:59,355
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of the first games to use real synthesized speech, such as the type that Rice Princess and I just performed for you guys.

1046
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:01,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, this is not Mission Impossible.

1047
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:03,979
[SPEAKER_03]: This was, I guess you could call it a spoof game.

1048
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:05,801
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some cool little screenshots there.

1049
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:07,502
[SPEAKER_03]: These are from the DS version of the game.

1050
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:08,483
[SPEAKER_03]: But look at that.

1051
01:10:09,364 --> 01:10:13,008
[SPEAKER_03]: What they did right with this is the same damn game, just with really pretty graphics.

1052
01:10:13,528 --> 01:10:14,209
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

1053
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:40,902
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's also coming out on the PSP you can see PSP, DS and Wii so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen there also what's new to this game there is a new tutorial mode there's also three game modes and three characters to choose from the characters look to be the dude that was in the original game a chick now is that a chick or a guy with long hair actually I can't tell oh no it's a chick and a robot named Gamma what?

1054
01:10:42,163 --> 01:10:42,904
[SPEAKER_06]: a robot?

1055
01:10:43,284 --> 01:10:44,505
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what it is a robot

1056
01:10:45,527 --> 01:10:47,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, the three game modes you can play.

1057
01:10:47,548 --> 01:10:50,851
[SPEAKER_03]: New, original, and of course, the hybrid mode.

1058
01:10:51,072 --> 01:10:52,693
[SPEAKER_03]: The original game with the updated graphics.

1059
01:10:53,074 --> 01:10:53,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Swoon.

1060
01:10:53,774 --> 01:10:57,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so when you play the robot, does he say, get him, my humans?

1061
01:10:57,858 --> 01:10:58,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, that doesn't make sense.

1062
01:10:58,999 --> 01:10:59,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Why a robot?

1063
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:00,260
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?

1064
01:11:01,021 --> 01:11:03,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's like an android or something.

1065
01:11:03,583 --> 01:11:03,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1066
01:11:04,304 --> 01:11:06,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't you still say, get him, my robots?

1067
01:11:06,926 --> 01:11:10,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what they do, they shot out little electricity beams, and if you're made of metal, that's probably going to hurt.

1068
01:11:11,969 --> 01:11:14,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, that just seems a little bit shady to me.

1069
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:16,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I want this game anymore.

1070
01:11:17,112 --> 01:11:21,074
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna not buy this game based off the fact you could play as a robot.

1071
01:11:22,054 --> 01:11:27,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I could also just play it, like, on the Commodore 64, like it originally was.

1072
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:28,778
[SPEAKER_03]: But new game modes!

1073
01:11:29,538 --> 01:11:29,878
[SPEAKER_07]: So?

1074
01:11:29,898 --> 01:11:31,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1075
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally buying it for the Wii.

1076
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to this game so much.

1077
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:37,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they ever say if this was coming to the US for sure?

1078
01:11:38,523 --> 01:11:40,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know this is coming to, um...

1079
01:11:40,931 --> 01:11:45,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe, and I can see the box art has the Europe ratings on it, but did they ever say they'd confirm this for the U.S.?

1080
01:11:46,556 --> 01:11:51,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know the same company's putting out Elevator Action, and that's coming to the U.S., so it is probably.

1081
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:51,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

1082
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:52,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so.

1083
01:11:52,622 --> 01:11:55,284
[SPEAKER_03]: System 8 or whatever, we should call them and get an interview.

1084
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:56,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do that.

1085
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:57,085
[SPEAKER_03]: System 3?

1086
01:11:57,466 --> 01:11:57,966
[SPEAKER_03]: System 3, sorry.

1087
01:11:57,986 --> 01:11:59,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I thought System 8.

1088
01:12:00,088 --> 01:12:05,032
[SPEAKER_03]: System 3, I'm going to call them and try to get an interview, and beg and plead for impossible admission like a sad little fanboy.

1089
01:12:07,054 --> 01:12:07,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

1090
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:17,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of sad little fanboys, but nothing actually having to do with sad little fanboys, guess what is coming out to the Wii, thanks to Vivendi?

1091
01:12:18,025 --> 01:12:19,106
[SPEAKER_08]: We are getting Scarface.

1092
01:12:20,767 --> 01:12:33,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is kind of funny, because with the game that it being, you're actually going to be using the nunchuck to walk, to drive, to walk around, to pilot boats, and you shoot using the Wiimote.

1093
01:12:34,082 --> 01:12:38,826
[SPEAKER_08]: and you even have a chainsaw for hand-to-hand combat so you have to wiggle around and all that.

1094
01:12:39,846 --> 01:12:48,253
[SPEAKER_08]: But where on the PS2 and Xbox Ones you had to swear to increase your kill factor, you do it by making dirty gestures with your Wiimote.

1095
01:12:49,474 --> 01:12:52,336
[SPEAKER_08]: The more you gesture, the more your kill factor goes up.

1096
01:12:52,516 --> 01:12:53,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot sluts, yes or no?

1097
01:12:54,497 --> 01:12:55,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I see nothing regarding hot sluts.

1098
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,520
[SPEAKER_03]: There are hot sluts in the game.

1099
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:02,023
[SPEAKER_08]: The game will take place after the final mansion shootout.

1100
01:13:05,019 --> 01:13:18,365
[SPEAKER_02]: OMG spoilers oh come on the movie's from 1983 Rob it's basically he doesn't die and he has to instead he has to reclaim his fortune wait he dies at the end?

1101
01:13:19,085 --> 01:13:33,632
[SPEAKER_03]: yes he dies at the end of the movie oh great next thing I know you're going to tell me that like freaking Darth Vader is Luke's father or something you're going to tell me like freaking you know the Titanic sinks in that movie I mean what else do you want to ruin for me while you're here

1102
01:13:36,035 --> 01:13:37,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I have to kick somebody out of the chatroom.

1103
01:13:39,636 --> 01:13:40,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Is somebody being bad?

1104
01:13:41,457 --> 01:13:42,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, somebody's being punished.

1105
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:51,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I told Nintendo Maniac 64 not to use the, uh, um, the, what you're listening to shit in the chatroom.

1106
01:13:51,041 --> 01:13:51,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that stuff annoys.

1107
01:13:52,201 --> 01:13:54,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so, uh, next, uh, next time's gonna be a ban, so.

1108
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:55,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, regulate.

1109
01:13:55,903 --> 01:13:56,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1110
01:13:56,483 --> 01:13:57,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care who it is.

1111
01:13:57,663 --> 01:13:58,324
[SPEAKER_08]: We have rules for reasons.

1112
01:13:58,344 --> 01:13:59,844
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I'm listening to hot sluts porn?

1113
01:14:01,425 --> 01:14:01,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

1114
01:14:02,811 --> 01:14:04,811
[SPEAKER_08]: No one gives a shit about what anybody else is listening to.

1115
01:14:04,831 --> 01:14:06,152
[SPEAKER_08]: You're supposed to be listening to the show.

1116
01:14:08,072 --> 01:14:08,672
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

1117
01:14:08,892 --> 01:14:10,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else on Scarface you want to add?

1118
01:14:12,373 --> 01:14:12,533
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1119
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:13,093
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1120
01:14:13,573 --> 01:14:16,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, speaking of games... Snape kills Tony!

1121
01:14:17,914 --> 01:14:27,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of games on the Wii, there is a trend that we're going to start seeing, much like we did with DS, where companies go, hey, we're making games for the Wii, too.

1122
01:14:27,695 --> 01:14:29,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, well, what games do you have?

1123
01:14:29,596 --> 01:14:31,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, well, um...

1124
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:34,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninja Bread Man

1125
01:15:01,767 --> 01:15:04,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Ninja Bread Man sounds awesome.

1126
01:15:05,469 --> 01:15:06,790
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about, crap games?

1127
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:07,470
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds great.

1128
01:15:07,651 --> 01:15:09,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster Trucks Extreme.

1129
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:11,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Trucks spelled T-R-U-X, of course.

1130
01:15:14,214 --> 01:15:16,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, isn't that one of your favorite things ever?

1131
01:15:16,395 --> 01:15:19,317
[SPEAKER_03]: When they purposefully missed Bratz, B-R-A-T-Z?

1132
01:15:19,597 --> 01:15:20,317
[SPEAKER_08]: That's retarded.

1133
01:15:20,718 --> 01:15:24,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's Monster Trucks Extreme Off-Road Edition.

1134
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I guess the last game was on-road.

1135
01:15:28,822 --> 01:15:30,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that related to Big Mother Truckers?

1136
01:15:30,848 --> 01:15:32,129
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's probably just a crappy game.

1137
01:15:33,249 --> 01:15:37,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Anubis 2, Rock and Roll Adventures.

1138
01:15:37,972 --> 01:15:41,053
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Rock and Roll High School.

1139
01:15:41,133 --> 01:15:41,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so there.

1140
01:15:41,953 --> 01:15:42,434
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.

1141
01:15:43,174 --> 01:15:44,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Hamster Heroes.

1142
01:15:45,495 --> 01:15:46,996
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you call these bad games?

1143
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:48,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Hamster Heroes?

1144
01:15:48,417 --> 01:15:49,437
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds amazing.

1145
01:15:50,898 --> 01:15:52,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Mini Desktop Racing.

1146
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:55,320
[SPEAKER_02]: These will be the people that put out Laser Cats.

1147
01:15:55,919 --> 01:16:01,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Trixie in Toyland, London Taxi Rush Hour, and let's see what else we had here.

1148
01:16:01,403 --> 01:16:05,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy the Wizard, uh, I can't even read what that said.

1149
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:11,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like fucking, oh, Rocket Broomstick Racing, and, um,

1150
01:16:12,247 --> 01:16:13,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna play Hamster Heroes!

1151
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:27,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Data Design Interactive.

1152
01:16:27,729 --> 01:16:28,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we could check out their website.

1153
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:29,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you send them an email, Loki?

1154
01:16:29,991 --> 01:16:30,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in touch with them.

1155
01:16:30,672 --> 01:16:31,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send them.

1156
01:16:31,072 --> 01:16:34,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them we will promote Hamster Heroes here on the program and Ninja Bread Man.

1157
01:16:35,156 --> 01:16:39,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I like hamsters, but, you know, I don't know if that game's going to be any good.

1158
01:16:39,579 --> 01:16:40,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, who gives a shit?

1159
01:16:40,981 --> 01:16:44,724
[SPEAKER_02]: They're putting out Chicken Shoot on fucking, you know, the Wii.

1160
01:16:45,084 --> 01:16:46,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know what?

1161
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:49,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's only fair that they're allowed to put these games out.

1162
01:16:49,768 --> 01:16:51,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Just all you have to do...

1163
01:16:52,418 --> 01:16:58,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Monster Trucks Extreme, at least better than Monster 4x4 World Circuit, because that game was atrocious.

1164
01:16:59,099 --> 01:17:02,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireboma says, Rocket Broomstick Racing sounds like Quidditch, but worse.

1165
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,501
[SPEAKER_03]: To which somebody else had a follow-up.

1166
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:10,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of spoilers, because we were talking about spoilers in the last one, GS68 had a comment for DarkSakura.

1167
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:13,563
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 has figured out who will die in Book 7.

1168
01:17:14,683 --> 01:17:16,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Harry and Nintendo Maniac 64.

1169
01:17:17,283 --> 01:17:18,924
[SPEAKER_03]: So he posted that spoiler there in chat.

1170
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:19,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1171
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:22,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see.

1172
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:27,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, apparently there was a LaserCats 2 on last night on the old Saturday Night Live.

1173
01:17:27,754 --> 01:17:29,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It was LaserCats 2.

1174
01:17:29,756 --> 01:17:30,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?

1175
01:17:30,356 --> 01:17:31,717
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always LaserCats 2.

1176
01:17:32,157 --> 01:17:33,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was a rerun then.

1177
01:17:33,058 --> 01:17:34,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1178
01:17:34,639 --> 01:17:35,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's see.

1179
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:37,021
[SPEAKER_03]: What else was there?

1180
01:17:38,081 --> 01:17:40,463
[SPEAKER_03]: FireBoma says Rock and Roll High School sounds like a porno.

1181
01:17:42,013 --> 01:17:45,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Solid Goomba says, Hamsters are proof God loves us.

1182
01:17:45,774 --> 01:17:47,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the website... I agree.

1183
01:17:47,215 --> 01:17:57,157
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, the company, Data Design Interactive, to be fair, they did put out E-Rake Extreme Metal Racing, which apparently is a pretty cool game.

1184
01:17:57,217 --> 01:18:03,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it mixes heavy metal with racing, so... These guys sound like modern-day geniuses.

1185
01:18:03,599 --> 01:18:05,580
[SPEAKER_03]: They know the types of games people want.

1186
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Who doesn't want Ninja Bread Man?

1187
01:18:08,401 --> 01:18:09,541
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I don't know...

1188
01:18:10,595 --> 01:18:13,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Please explain to me how this could possibly be a bad thing.

1189
01:18:14,596 --> 01:18:17,316
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in the UK, so, I mean... That's even better!

1190
01:18:18,717 --> 01:18:20,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Jamie's gonna want him, too!

1191
01:18:21,057 --> 01:18:24,058
[SPEAKER_02]: We can contact their project director.

1192
01:18:24,078 --> 01:18:26,078
[SPEAKER_08]: The hamster thing just sounds dirty.

1193
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:28,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them on the show.

1194
01:18:29,499 --> 01:18:30,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do whatever it takes.

1195
01:18:31,799 --> 01:18:32,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

1196
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:39,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is interesting, and this is one group that will not be playing...

1197
01:18:43,843 --> 01:18:55,506
[SPEAKER_03]: What's basically going on is that there's this Christian group, and they call themselves the Porn Talk, which is backed by basically a faith-based ministry.

1198
01:18:55,666 --> 01:19:02,567
[SPEAKER_03]: They've started a website that basically has this huge banner on it, and it says, We have a porn problem.

1199
01:19:02,968 --> 01:19:05,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Porn safety facts for Nintendo's Wii gaming console.

1200
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:08,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to visit the site, it's theporntalk.com.

1201
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:09,800
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1202
01:19:30,402 --> 01:19:48,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to also point out to the geniuses behind ThePornTalk.com that the computers you used to make ThePornTalk.com, that you're urging your kids to go check out to keep them away from porn, or, well, okay, I guess they're really not doing that, but you're urging parents to go check out to keep their kids away from porn, that device can also be used to access porn.

1203
01:19:49,293 --> 01:19:52,915
[SPEAKER_03]: If your child has a cell phone, that can be used to access porn.

1204
01:19:53,075 --> 01:19:53,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's something funny, too.

1205
01:19:54,016 --> 01:19:59,479
[SPEAKER_03]: If they have a dollar, or what is it, $3.95, that can be used to access porn.

1206
01:19:59,927 --> 01:20:03,008
[SPEAKER_03]: at your local... Is somebody fucking racing outside?

1207
01:20:03,028 --> 01:20:04,028
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I don't like having the window open.

1208
01:20:04,048 --> 01:20:04,968
[SPEAKER_02]: In your apartment complex.

1209
01:20:05,128 --> 01:20:06,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I gotta add this real quick.

1210
01:20:06,749 --> 01:20:07,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1211
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:12,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, imagine, if you will, they tell them, yeah, go to that porn talk site.

1212
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:16,092
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll teach you how to, you know, prevent, you know, seeing porn and stuff.

1213
01:20:16,552 --> 01:20:16,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1214
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:20,253
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't remember what the website name was, so they search for porn talk.

1215
01:20:20,873 --> 01:20:21,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom!

1216
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:21,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Porn!

1217
01:20:21,793 --> 01:20:22,393
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go!

1218
01:20:23,214 --> 01:20:28,295
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been... They've been, um... The porn beat them to the website, so...

1219
01:20:29,369 --> 01:20:29,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1220
01:20:30,009 --> 01:20:35,230
[SPEAKER_03]: They're bragging on their site that Porn Talk won best in show at the Addy Awards and all this junk.

1221
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:36,751
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck's the Addy Awards?

1222
01:20:36,771 --> 01:20:37,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1223
01:20:37,091 --> 01:20:37,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

1224
01:20:38,491 --> 01:20:44,473
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the award show where we invited just us and we won because we're awesome.

1225
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:47,273
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking about the Wii and Wi-Fi devices on the Porn Talk blog.

1226
01:20:47,293 --> 01:20:53,495
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this issue and your suggestions on dealing with devices that come with internet capabilities.

1227
01:20:53,936 --> 01:20:59,519
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be banning PCs next then and Macs and your cell phone.

1228
01:20:59,639 --> 01:21:01,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you crawl into a cave?

1229
01:21:02,341 --> 01:21:04,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just looking at some interesting comments on the actual site itself.

1230
01:21:05,003 --> 01:21:06,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I figure these comments are posted publicly.

1231
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,705
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no problem with me reading them on air, correct?

1232
01:21:09,686 --> 01:21:10,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Ray said...

1233
01:21:11,013 --> 01:21:15,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for talking to your kids about porn, but the porntalk.com goes a little overboard.

1234
01:21:15,415 --> 01:21:18,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Using filtering software on your 17-year-old is a little outrageous.

1235
01:21:18,516 --> 01:21:20,536
[SPEAKER_03]: He or she will be in college the next year.

1236
01:21:20,836 --> 01:21:22,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really want them so sheltered?

1237
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:23,057
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll go crazy.

1238
01:21:23,377 --> 01:21:29,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to mention the chances are your 17-year-old will know a lot more about computers than you and will have no problem getting any content they want.

1239
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:34,241
[SPEAKER_03]: In related news, Ray is the OLR Not Listener of the Week.

1240
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:39,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Common sense, people.

1241
01:21:39,943 --> 01:21:40,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking use it.

1242
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:48,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know there are ways to block the internet for your children.

1243
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:49,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, don't download the thing.

1244
01:21:51,785 --> 01:21:52,306
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1245
01:21:53,386 --> 01:21:55,748
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course that would involve the parents being involved.

1246
01:21:55,888 --> 01:21:59,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's not going to ever happen.

1247
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:00,951
[SPEAKER_02]: That's never going to work.

1248
01:22:00,991 --> 01:22:01,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.

1249
01:22:02,152 --> 01:22:04,513
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 makes an excellent point in chat.

1250
01:22:04,813 --> 01:22:08,515
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 over at chat.orangelearnersradio.com says, Women have boobs.

1251
01:22:08,976 --> 01:22:10,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Women are gateway to porn.

1252
01:22:11,237 --> 01:22:11,637
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1253
01:22:12,038 --> 01:22:12,798
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all women's fault.

1254
01:22:13,407 --> 01:22:14,468
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about that, DarkSakura?

1255
01:22:15,308 --> 01:22:16,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yes, boobs.

1256
01:22:16,869 --> 01:22:18,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's all of our fault.

1257
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:23,913
[SPEAKER_08]: And while they're at it, how about putting live birth on TV too?

1258
01:22:24,193 --> 01:22:25,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that shows off the coochie.

1259
01:22:26,914 --> 01:22:30,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, don't they already have to show the miracle of life as part of education in schools?

1260
01:22:31,317 --> 01:22:32,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Not if you live in Alabama.

1261
01:22:32,297 --> 01:22:34,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was a gateway to pornography.

1262
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:40,722
[SPEAKER_03]: The minute I saw a baby flying out of that woman's vagina, I knew I never ever wanted to touch one.

1263
01:22:44,132 --> 01:22:45,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Health Ed made you gay.

1264
01:22:45,233 --> 01:22:50,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, sex education made me gay, I think, I don't know.

1265
01:22:51,456 --> 01:23:05,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, obviously stories about these crazy people who go OMG porn and have these hair trigger reactions and this kind of crap get us angry, and when we get angry it's time for our FUs of the week.

1266
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:18,449
[SPEAKER_08]: My F.U.

1267
01:23:18,469 --> 01:23:23,332
[SPEAKER_08]: of the Week goes towards people who say, you're not so-and-so, so you don't know.

1268
01:23:24,312 --> 01:23:27,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you're not a parent, so you have no right to talk about children.

1269
01:23:28,974 --> 01:23:30,955
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm intelligent.

1270
01:23:31,515 --> 01:23:32,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a brain.

1271
01:23:32,336 --> 01:23:33,176
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm observant.

1272
01:23:33,896 --> 01:23:34,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had little brothers.

1273
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:43,380
[SPEAKER_08]: As a human being and as a woman who may one day give birth to children... Shiver.

1274
01:23:44,621 --> 01:23:46,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Not you, just the baby flying out of your vagina.

1275
01:23:48,619 --> 01:23:52,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that completely discounts anything that you have to say.

1276
01:23:52,682 --> 01:24:04,111
[SPEAKER_08]: When people start off with, you don't know because you are not, you know, that instantly removes all credibility from any argument that you might have by, because you're trying to immediately dismiss the other party.

1277
01:24:05,131 --> 01:24:08,394
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't put you in a superior position, that puts you in a position of ignorance.

1278
01:24:08,474 --> 01:24:09,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking shut your mouth.

1279
01:24:10,956 --> 01:24:11,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

1280
01:24:12,417 --> 01:24:12,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki!

1281
01:24:13,878 --> 01:24:13,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1282
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:21,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess FUV or Apartment Complex for not actually having lines in the parking lot so everyone has to kind of guess to where the cars are supposed to be.

1283
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:23,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of sucks.

1284
01:24:23,376 --> 01:24:33,803
[SPEAKER_02]: And have you noticed that none of these blogs that point out the porn on the PSP and porn on the Wii and stuff, nobody's talking about the PlayStation 3 at all.

1285
01:24:33,823 --> 01:24:34,784
[SPEAKER_02]: No one owns a PlayStation 3.

1286
01:24:35,925 --> 01:24:36,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1287
01:24:37,426 --> 01:24:39,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So more porn for me, and in high definition.

1288
01:24:39,747 --> 01:24:40,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hell yeah.

1289
01:24:40,588 --> 01:24:40,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1290
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:48,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob D in chat says, I like how Sky makes it sound like vaginas are rocket launchers.

1291
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in a way they kind of are.

1292
01:24:52,507 --> 01:24:52,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, Jamie?

1293
01:24:54,148 --> 01:24:54,548
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1294
01:24:55,309 --> 01:24:55,569
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1295
01:24:55,889 --> 01:25:04,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, my FU of the week goes to lack of sleep because I swear like every night this week I got maybe four hours of sleep at the most.

1296
01:25:04,155 --> 01:25:05,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, granted, that's my own downfall.

1297
01:25:05,616 --> 01:25:06,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you're thinking.

1298
01:25:06,497 --> 01:25:07,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to bed early, Rob.

1299
01:25:07,378 --> 01:25:07,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know.

1300
01:25:08,632 --> 01:25:11,493
[SPEAKER_03]: There's such good TV on at 2 in the morning.

1301
01:25:11,513 --> 01:25:12,154
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

1302
01:25:12,214 --> 01:25:13,694
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just, you know, for circumstances.

1303
01:25:13,974 --> 01:25:17,336
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just exhausted yesterday when Jamie and I were running around San Francisco yesterday.

1304
01:25:17,356 --> 01:25:19,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so tired I thought I was going to pass out.

1305
01:25:19,137 --> 01:25:21,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I slept for 11 hours last night.

1306
01:25:21,678 --> 01:25:23,058
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel pretty good today.

1307
01:25:23,078 --> 01:25:24,739
[SPEAKER_03]: A bit groggy from oversleeping.

1308
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:26,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So FU to lack of sleep.

1309
01:25:28,741 --> 01:25:29,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

1310
01:25:30,161 --> 01:25:31,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess left.

1311
01:25:31,482 --> 01:25:32,202
[SPEAKER_03]: LankyStyle left.

1312
01:25:32,242 --> 01:25:33,383
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're the only ones in studio.

1313
01:25:33,423 --> 01:25:36,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So back to the gaming news then since there's no more FUs of the week.

1314
01:25:37,256 --> 01:25:38,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1315
01:25:55,697 --> 01:26:09,765
[SPEAKER_08]: took a survey of 1,000 drivers between the ages of 16 to 24 about video games, how it's affecting their driving habits, and the results stated 27% admitted to taking more risks on the road after playing a racing game.

1316
01:26:11,426 --> 01:26:14,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And a quarter saying they pretend they're actually in a video game when they drive.

1317
01:26:16,609 --> 01:26:21,592
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying that that's an indisputable link between gaming and dangerous driving.

1318
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:42,786
[SPEAKER_08]: What they're not really paying attention to is that if they're interviewing people between the ages of 16 and 24, chances are that your audience is not going to be very fucking mature and not going to have the skill to know about, you know, how to drive properly.

1319
01:26:44,487 --> 01:26:47,288
[SPEAKER_03]: It's... You're dying to say something over there, Loki.

1320
01:26:47,868 --> 01:26:50,909
[SPEAKER_02]: What they fail to mention is all those people that said they drive recklessly, women.

1321
01:26:52,461 --> 01:26:58,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, then again, I mean, I can't imagine too many of them actually, 27%, yeah, that sounds about right.

1322
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:00,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1323
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:02,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

1324
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:05,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, even if they weren't playing video games, they'd still be crashing into this shit.

1325
01:27:05,941 --> 01:27:09,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear to God, people talking on their cell phones, drifting in and out of lanes.

1326
01:27:10,143 --> 01:27:12,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the funniest thing happened to me today.

1327
01:27:13,404 --> 01:27:14,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought food.

1328
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

1329
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:21,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, people are dying and just like totally oblivious to the fucking world.

1330
01:27:21,606 --> 01:27:23,327
[SPEAKER_02]: How did I end up in this river?

1331
01:27:24,047 --> 01:27:26,147
[SPEAKER_02]: They totally jumped out in front of me.

1332
01:27:26,348 --> 01:27:30,449
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like... I think anything that...

1333
01:27:32,452 --> 01:27:36,154
[SPEAKER_08]: has an effect on your reaction.

1334
01:27:36,174 --> 01:27:43,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if you have a predisposition toward anger or nervousness, that's what's going to, I think, more affect how you drive.

1335
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Not so much the game.

1336
01:27:47,381 --> 01:27:56,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's just, that's really, I mean, even when I was a new driver, you know, playing hard driving didn't make me want to go out and do the loop on the road.

1337
01:27:57,007 --> 01:27:59,288
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, hard driving, you were driving super damn slow.

1338
01:27:59,308 --> 01:28:01,069
[SPEAKER_02]: At least it felt slow in the game.

1339
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:04,921
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not playing a driving video game that makes you want to drive fast.

1340
01:28:04,981 --> 01:28:09,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fucking Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 2 soundtrack that makes you want to drive fast.

1341
01:28:11,042 --> 01:28:14,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck yeah.

1342
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:18,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Try and catch me now, fucking coppers.

1343
01:28:18,863 --> 01:28:19,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1344
01:28:19,403 --> 01:28:28,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be a little bit serious here, I would think if anything, playing video games would help you drive better because you're actually going to have a faster reaction time.

1345
01:28:29,529 --> 01:28:34,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, from games, they've actually helped you improve your reaction time a little bit, I would think.

1346
01:28:35,351 --> 01:28:39,293
[SPEAKER_02]: So, whatever, it's a fucking survey.

1347
01:28:39,873 --> 01:28:40,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Surveys suck.

1348
01:28:42,094 --> 01:28:44,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Survey says you suck.

1349
01:28:45,655 --> 01:28:53,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So, funny you should be playing, um, you know, that kind of music, but, um, Yuzo Kishiro is going to be DJing play, um,

1350
01:28:55,561 --> 01:29:01,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the concert in June, he's going to be DJing, I believe it's the concert in Japan?

1351
01:29:01,963 --> 01:29:03,603
[SPEAKER_02]: No, in Singapore.

1352
01:29:04,064 --> 01:29:05,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I better start driving to Singapore.

1353
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:13,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Rob, drive to Singapore.

1354
01:29:14,807 --> 01:29:16,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the ocean, that would be awesome.

1355
01:29:17,447 --> 01:29:19,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll drive so fast I'll float on the water, come on.

1356
01:29:21,002 --> 01:29:21,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1357
01:29:22,243 --> 01:29:25,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe you'll just fart so hard you'll float over the water.

1358
01:29:26,526 --> 01:29:36,932
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought that was pretty cool, and he's done such music from Streets of Rage, Revenge of Shinobi, Actraiser, Castlevania Portrait of Ruin, lots of stuff.

1359
01:29:38,513 --> 01:29:39,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to be spinning some tracks.

1360
01:29:40,594 --> 01:29:43,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad he's not coming over here, just in Singapore.

1361
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:45,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, Bandit is my new best friend in chat.

1362
01:29:46,358 --> 01:29:48,539
[SPEAKER_03]: If Sonic can do it, why can't Sky?

1363
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:49,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1364
01:29:50,419 --> 01:29:52,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic is a fictional blue hedgehog.

1365
01:29:53,842 --> 01:29:55,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think hedgehogs move that fast anyways.

1366
01:29:57,605 --> 01:29:58,385
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just pokey.

1367
01:30:01,268 --> 01:30:03,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was irony or something.

1368
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:07,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And hamster heroes, is there a hamster that runs real fast?

1369
01:30:08,093 --> 01:30:09,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but there's one that looks like Batman.

1370
01:30:10,495 --> 01:30:12,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, this is the best game ever!

1371
01:30:14,418 --> 01:30:15,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking hamsters...

1372
01:30:16,178 --> 01:30:18,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever had a hamster?

1373
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:20,121
[SPEAKER_03]: In grade school.

1374
01:30:20,161 --> 01:30:23,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember whenever you go in the classroom that has a hamster, it smells like poop.

1375
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:26,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And they poop out pellets, which I always thought was amusing.

1376
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:29,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me tell you a story about hamsters real quick.

1377
01:30:29,107 --> 01:30:30,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Hamsters are retarded.

1378
01:30:30,748 --> 01:30:35,472
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason you would own a hamster is to watch how retarded it is.

1379
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:36,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a hamster.

1380
01:30:36,913 --> 01:30:40,095
[SPEAKER_02]: We named him Sam because it was squeaks and moves.

1381
01:30:40,155 --> 01:30:41,816
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically what it stood for.

1382
01:30:41,876 --> 01:30:42,877
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so creative.

1383
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:45,519
[SPEAKER_02]: The hamster would spin...

1384
01:30:46,303 --> 01:30:47,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1385
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,182
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Wii game I want.

1386
01:31:17,202 --> 01:31:23,306
[SPEAKER_02]: They sit there, their feet fucking up in the air, pull the poop out of their ass, and they throw it.

1387
01:31:25,688 --> 01:31:27,289
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the weirdest thing to see.

1388
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:30,171
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys don't understand why I'm laughing so hard.

1389
01:31:30,632 --> 01:31:36,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, and thank God this isn't TV, but Loki actually put his feet up in the air.

1390
01:31:39,313 --> 01:31:43,154
[SPEAKER_04]: and reached for it and did the motion like the hamster does.

1391
01:31:43,654 --> 01:31:45,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob's all red in the face and adorable.

1392
01:31:47,195 --> 01:31:49,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, we need a TV show just for moments like that.

1393
01:31:49,715 --> 01:31:50,455
[SPEAKER_08]: The hell we do.

1394
01:31:51,855 --> 01:31:53,296
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have a hamster on the TV show.

1395
01:31:53,856 --> 01:31:54,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a cape on him.

1396
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:56,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that should be our new mascot as a hamster.

1397
01:31:56,956 --> 01:31:59,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, they only live about a year or two, so it's not worth it.

1398
01:31:59,797 --> 01:32:03,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And every single one of them dies from cancer, so I'm not even worried.

1399
01:32:05,078 --> 01:32:06,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even worth it.

1400
01:32:07,076 --> 01:32:07,376
[SPEAKER_03]: HamsterDance

1401
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:56,848
[SPEAKER_03]: and let's see that's coming out for $30 and that by the way originally showed up in Japan in September of 2005 so it's like one of those hey it's about freaking time we got that over here it was supposed to come out last year around August as well but then company it switched company XS Game dropped it so yeah whatever anyhow it should be noted though that Raiden 4 is coming out on Xbox 360 for those of you unfamiliar with the franchise it's just one of those shooter games that you know a lot of people love so there you go

1402
01:32:57,899 --> 01:32:59,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence Online Servers

1403
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:28,945
[SPEAKER_08]: is going bye-bye.

1404
01:33:29,465 --> 01:33:32,347
[SPEAKER_08]: As of April 2nd, it will be gone.

1405
01:33:34,108 --> 01:33:35,909
[SPEAKER_08]: The community is not big enough.

1406
01:33:38,051 --> 01:33:47,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the user community for the game, those who are loyal to it, are putting up internet petitions to try to keep it up, but it's in the category of not fucking lightly.

1407
01:33:49,158 --> 01:33:49,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1408
01:33:49,558 --> 01:33:49,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1409
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:51,600
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd like if it works.

1410
01:33:51,861 --> 01:33:55,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Petitions don't usually magically fix everything, but I know that's got to suck to get the plug pulled.

1411
01:33:56,203 --> 01:33:58,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Music game fans got Amplitude's plug pulled on them.

1412
01:33:59,024 --> 01:34:02,026
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, Amplitude came out like five years ago.

1413
01:34:02,386 --> 01:34:05,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Substance 3, Substance, I can never remember.

1414
01:34:06,008 --> 01:34:06,408
[SPEAKER_02]: About a year ago.

1415
01:34:06,948 --> 01:34:07,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not that old.

1416
01:34:08,069 --> 01:34:08,629
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in March.

1417
01:34:08,689 --> 01:34:09,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Substance.

1418
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:10,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it, Substance.

1419
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:15,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and to be honest, it just didn't sell that well and not many people used it online.

1420
01:34:15,152 --> 01:34:19,094
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what you get when you have, you know, fucking networks that are run by each individual company.

1421
01:34:19,134 --> 01:34:20,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So one centralized network,

1422
01:34:21,024 --> 01:34:22,185
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1423
01:34:47,984 --> 01:34:49,204
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1424
01:35:12,210 --> 01:35:23,338
[SPEAKER_02]: including some photon whips and slicers, new stages, even a casino and apparently the casino is run by penguin-esque Rappies.

1425
01:35:23,538 --> 01:35:24,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should go back to PSU.

1426
01:35:26,941 --> 01:35:27,621
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds neat.

1427
01:35:28,282 --> 01:35:28,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I like penguins.

1428
01:35:28,942 --> 01:35:31,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Rappies.

1429
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:37,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Rappies, no, if you've done the Rappie holiday quest, you will never like Rappies again.

1430
01:35:38,601 --> 01:35:43,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I believe is still going in the Fantasy Star Online, or the old PSO.

1431
01:35:44,143 --> 01:35:50,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the Christmas Quest is still going on the Xbox One, as it has been for the past, not 360, but the regular Xbox.

1432
01:35:50,265 --> 01:35:53,066
[SPEAKER_08]: It was going on Blue Burst for like six months.

1433
01:35:53,086 --> 01:35:53,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seriously.

1434
01:35:54,367 --> 01:35:55,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, jeez.

1435
01:35:55,387 --> 01:35:55,987
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

1436
01:35:56,327 --> 01:35:58,328
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all, oh crap, we still have that game.

1437
01:35:59,048 --> 01:35:59,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1438
01:36:00,069 --> 01:36:03,610
[SPEAKER_08]: And for anyone who'd like to know, I quit PSU last week.

1439
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:06,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

1440
01:36:06,491 --> 01:36:06,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, congratulations.

1441
01:36:07,655 --> 01:36:12,957
[SPEAKER_08]: That goes to show just what my opinion of PSU is.

1442
01:36:13,057 --> 01:36:18,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing World of Warcraft and I'm trying to get Jamie to join our little guild we've got going on Ravencrest.

1443
01:36:19,838 --> 01:36:20,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I talked her into it.

1444
01:36:20,759 --> 01:36:23,379
[SPEAKER_08]: How about when I have time and when someone gets me Burning Crusade?

1445
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:26,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, how about we take a break?

1446
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:27,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I like breaks.

1447
01:36:28,161 --> 01:36:36,083
[SPEAKER_03]: A break, and when we come back we'll have more of Orange Lounge Radio, more hilarious things coming out of Loki's mouth and other orifices probably.

1448
01:36:37,142 --> 01:36:40,523
[SPEAKER_03]: in the next part, Part B. Because we have a lot of 360 news we haven't gotten to yet.

1449
01:36:40,804 --> 01:36:48,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see you back in a little bit for Orange Lounge Radio Part B. Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1450
01:36:49,266 --> 01:36:53,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
