00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
It is March 18, 2007, and you're on Part B of our podcast.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Remember, we tape Orange Lounge Radio in two halves every week.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
If you're listening to us on the podcast or audio blog feed and you haven't yet heard Part A,

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
you really should go back into iTunes or Podcast Alley or Yahoo Podcast, Dig Podcast,

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
whatever you use to listen to this program.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
You should go back and grab Part A because it's really great.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
Loki goes and tells us about the beautiful Katamari controversy you could say around the internet.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
He gives us the definitive date for Halo 3 in September, as he's heard,

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
and gives us a whole lot of other release date stuff in Part A.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
So check that out.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Not that I'm saying you shouldn't listen to this half of the show, too,

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
because we have some good stories for you in this half, right?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Because we missed so much stuff in the first half of the program.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
We do tape live on Sunday nights at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Join us sometime, shall we?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
All right, let's get into some of that news I was talking about.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Okay, so anyway, one thing that's been going around, it's kind of a rumor right now.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
Best Buy, there has been a shot from Best Buy's system, their POS system,

01:24.000 --> 01:29.000
and it's basically, well, it's a printout, I should say, from their computer system,

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
showing the status of the 20GB model of the PS3 is discontinued.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
And a lot of people have been saying, or actually Sony has been saying,

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
that it's because it's a choice for retailers, what systems they bring in,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
and that's why I haven't been able to find 20GB systems.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
Now, here's an interesting spin on it, though.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Our company, we haven't been able to get 20GB systems for a while now,

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
and they basically have been discontinued in our system as well,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
and this has been, I think, going on for about over a month.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
So I wouldn't be surprised if this is true, if they're discontinuing the 20GB system,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
probably because they're making more money off the 60GB system,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
and not a lot of people were snatching up the 20GB system.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
I don't know, I think 20GB was still pretty fine.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
I mean, 20 is enough space for right now, at least, so I don't know.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Not for the Xbox 360 with all that movie stuff.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm almost out of space, so I don't know.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
I think about that with the PlayStation 3.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
When I jump ship, I probably will get the 60GB model just because I'm a consumer whore.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And how?

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
I will just upgrade my hard drive in there.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Well, here's something cool.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Speaking of, we had talked about Tecmo earlier.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Tecmo is bringing out Ninja Gaiden Sigma.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
It has new backgrounds, enemies, characters, animations, textures,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
completely revamped for the next system.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.000
You can partially or fully install the game on the PS3 to help with load time.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
It will run at 60 frames per second, self-shadowing, and in 720p.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
So lots of Ninja Gaiden action.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
You also get a playable Rachel.

03:15.000 --> 03:22.000
Apparently, she's supposed to be very bouncy because it's Team Ninja.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
My question is will I actually be able to get anywhere in the game

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
without getting frustrated so that I throw my controller through the screen?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Nobody can help that you suck at it, Rob.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
No, everybody sucks at Ninja Gaiden.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It's a fucking hard game.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Dan was doing pretty good at it.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Well, Dan is a god among men then, I guess.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I don't know what to tell you.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Well, I only marry awesome.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
All right.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
Anyhow, a game I'm really looking forward to on the PlayStation 3,

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
and how sad is it that this is one of the games I'm really looking forward to

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
on the PlayStation 3?

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Loki's wagging his finger already because he knows what I'm going to say.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Sing Star on the PlayStation 3 is coming out, of course.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
A lot of people thought it was going to be something that was

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
like a network download, but no, I think at E3 they said it was going to be a full game.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Well, it is coming on a Blu-ray disc, and there's going to be HD videos on it,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
30 songs on the disc.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
We don't know exactly what 30 songs we're talking about yet,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
but I seem to remember at E3 last year,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
they demoed Survivor by Destiny's Child as one of the songs.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Am I on crack?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Wasn't there a Fallout boys song?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Wasn't Dance Dance one of them too?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
I could be wrong, but if you saw them at E3,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
chances are those licenses have carried over.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
We'll see.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
Regardless, I will make it my life mission to, on game 3.0 or whatever they call it,

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
I will make it my mission to get Loki YouTubed singing something.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Maybe Survivor would be a good song for Loki,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
but we'll get that on the Internet for all our listeners to download.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Or just Bobby Black Wolf because he's Loki's only friend on the PlayStation 3.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
I don't know.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
No, I'm not.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I'm sorry, you have like seven friends now.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I'm not his only friend.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh, sorry.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
He's not my only friend.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
You're very popular.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Exactly.

05:09.000 --> 05:18.000
Anyways, something that's kind of popular on the PC is distributed computing.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
They have a similar thing with folding at home as well as SETI at home, that type of stuff.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Well, I think they even talked about this back a long time ago

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
when they were talking about the cell processor.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Now you can actually, with the new firmware update 1.6,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
they'll be downloading folding at home as well.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
It's a funky little screensaver that helps process stuff to cure cancer.

05:43.000 --> 05:52.000
So you might have a part in curing diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
and many cancers and stuff like that.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Let me write that $600 check right now.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
It's for a good cause, right?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Exactly.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
You know, I don't know.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
It's interesting, that whole distributed, I think that website distributed net had something like that.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
It's a very interesting concept.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
I don't know as it is.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
The PlayStation 3 does suck a lot of power out of it.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
I mean, if this was something on the Wii, I can have it in standby and it would do this.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
There's Wii Connect 24 for you, huh?

06:25.000 --> 06:33.000
I don't know if I really want my PlayStation 3 with this giant screensaver on HDTV

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
just sitting there all day long, even if it was for a good cause.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Fuck that shit.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
It should be calculating what the winning lotto numbers are for me.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
That's the kind of computing I want to see the PlayStation 3 doing.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
I want it to see it earning money to pay for itself.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
That's what it should be doing.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Go out and get a job, PlayStation 3.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
Go out and watch some dishes somewhere.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.000
Get a job cooking French fries someplace.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Work the streets if you have to.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
I don't care.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Just help me pay the rent, PlayStation 3.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Pimp that Blu-ray.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
$600, make you holla.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Anyway.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah, make you holla.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
Why did I spend $600 on this goddamn Blu-ray player?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Anyway.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Well, in other news regarding the player itself,

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
the 1.6 firmware update for PS3 has a remote play function,

07:28.000 --> 07:39.000
so you can bring up any audio, video, photo stored on the PS3 using your PSP.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Actually, just anywhere you can find an internet connection.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
So that's kind of cool.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
Porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Mighty porn, mighty porn.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Okay.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Sorry, anytime you talk about sharing photos and movies and all that stuff,

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
I can't help but think of porn.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Is that so wrong?

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
I also can't help but think of Killzone on the PlayStation 3 coming out in July.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Actually, there's a lot of other things I can think of.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
I just needed to transition.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
What?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Oh, go ahead.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Well, anyway.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
Phil Harrison revealed some footage of Killzone on the PlayStation 3,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
of course, at Game Developers Conference.

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
I guess one of those things where the feedback from the journalist was not so hot,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
so they didn't end up showing it at the full Sony conference,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
even though folks were reporting they could see it on the screen,

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
like in the PS3, they didn't play it.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
It was a tease thing.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
But according to IGN, the game will, I guess, come out in July.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
It's not coming out in July.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
The demo will come out in July.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Interesting.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Yeah, the game itself is nowhere near done.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
But we'll probably see it at E3 or something like that.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Interesting.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
Another game that we can be looking forward to pretty soon,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
well, a few months off at least, but Grand Theft Auto IV.

09:12.000 --> 09:18.000
And it is thought, the rumor is that it's going to be set in a New York City setting.

09:18.000 --> 09:27.000
And this rumor comes from a couple of people that have been contracted

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
to come up with New York City themed music for the game.

09:31.000 --> 09:37.000
So, you know, possibly hinting at a New York City type theme.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
If I were to guess, I would say Liberty City,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
because that's supposed to be New York City anyways.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
So, I don't know.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
I would think Liberty City all over again is where it's going to be.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
But whatever, they could surprise us and have a real city in there.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
Either way, the game's not expected out until October.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.000
However, the first ever trailer of the game will be available March 29th.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And I cannot wait.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
And it better not suck.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Correct me if I'm wrong, but in the previous Grand Theft Auto game,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
you could fly planes at some point, right?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Yes.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Okay. Now, isn't putting the thing in New York City,

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
look, I'm trying not to be wrong here, but just thinking aloud here,

10:23.000 --> 10:28.000
by putting Grand Theft Auto in a town very similar to New York City,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
doesn't that kind of open it up for folks at home

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
to do some really unpolitically correct things in their game?

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Y'all know what I'm talking about. I don't have to say it.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
But you know kids across America are going to try to imitate it.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
You know, you can already, to be honest with you,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
you can't fly 747s or whatever.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
You can't fly giant jet planes.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
You can fly biplanes and stuff like that into towers

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
or jets and stuff like that.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Hell, if you want to do that now, go buy San Andreas

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
because you can do that right now.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
San Andreas was funny because you'd be driving along on a motorcycle

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
and a plane would crash into you.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
Random plane crashes are kind of fun in that game, too.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Either way, it's going to be awesome.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
This game is going to sell crazy,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
and people are going to get their panties in a bunch

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
because it's uber violent.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
I wouldn't have it any other way.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
That's why I bring this up.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
DarkShy and Shadowcourse, Rob, you're horrible.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
That's why I bring this up because if you're able to do that in the game,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
somebody's going to sue over it.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
Johnson is going to have his ego all over this crap with another lawsuit.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Let me put it this way.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
If I can have Sex with the Hooker in a jet,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
flying towards a building,

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
and then set a nuclear explosion off that wipes out the entire city,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
that would be awesome.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
Everybody seems to agree here that it's going to take place in the future.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
A, it's not really New York City.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
B, even if it was modeled after New York City a lot,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
it would be a future New York City

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
where that landmark I was previously referring to would be removed.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
But still, I don't know.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
I can't help but think they might put something in there

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
where folks should be able to make it look like that.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
All that would happen is you'd crash into the building

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
and your plane explodes.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
The building does not explode or fall apart.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
That's all that would happen is you're planning to explode

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
and be like, huh, it's like 9-11.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
And then you'd get it out of your system

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
and you'd go back to playing the damn game.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Or you'd be like me and do it a few more times

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
until you got it out of your system.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
But can you not see Tack Jomson in a courtroom

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
playing this footage, telling the judge how Rockstar is evil

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
and they're Al-Qaeda sympathizers

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
and the game should be banned from the market forever?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
No, no, no. Hold on, hold on.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
You're expecting him to actually show footage of the game.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I mean, he's trying to sue them now

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
about games that haven't even come out yet

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
that he doesn't know anything about

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
other than that they are making a game.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
He's an idiot.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Okay, that's it. We're not talking about him anymore.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Not done.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
He who shall not be named.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Let's not even refer to him. Just done. We're done.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Because there's stories about him this week I'm not talking about.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Didn't we say we were going to do that like a year ago?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
What?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And we're done. Done. Stop.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
We've already said too much.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Now I keep going to see if Loki's head explodes.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
Well, you know what we should do for our foe, our nemesis?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
We should send him one of the pink PS2s

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
that are out in Australia on the 15th.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Do you mean over at...

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
I had to censor myself.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Is that what you mean by arch nemesis?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
No, I was actually...

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Well, he's not necessarily an arch nemesis.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
He's more like a lackey.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
He would be like Toad is to Magneto.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Okay.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
No, I was referring to he who shall not be named.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
But I think a pink PS2 would just be the perfect thing

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
to cheer him up and get that stick out of his ass.

13:54.000 --> 14:01.000
But anyway, the pink pinky pink pink pink PlayStation 2

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
is in Australia as of March 15th.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
And it's pink.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
It's everything you lived with the PS2.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.000
Dude, I want the Sakura PS2 because it's like sort of purple and shiny.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Anyway.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
I swear to God I am sick and tired of hearing about Warhawk

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
and whether it's going to be on a fucking disc

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
or downloadable title.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Anyways, because of that, during Game Developers Conference,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
because this is back when they said,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
okay, downloadable only title, great.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Apparently some people are a little bit pissed off.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
A few people left the actual development team

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
because they were frustrated like this

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
and basically saying crap product will sell like crap

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
if it's on the shelf or not.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
So that's kind of my take on this thing.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
The game looked okay, but you know what?

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
I couldn't give a shit about whether it's on a disc,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
it's on the PlayStation Network or both.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Just release the damn game because I swear to God,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
the longer it takes this game to come out,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
the worse it seems to get.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
So that is it.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
I'm done with Warhawk.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
I don't care about Warhawk.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
I will never read another story about the game coming out on disc

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
or on the network or at all.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
You know, why are we bothered putting together an outline

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
if you're just going to skip my stories?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Whatever.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
No, it's fine.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Didn't we talk about it last week anyway?

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Yeah.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
PlayStation 3 is getting episodic games.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Who cares?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Because I remember us having a conversation about this last week.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
Who has put together successfully an episodic franchise

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
except for Sam & Max as the only one I can think of

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
in the past little while that's been successful?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
I don't care about episodic games.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
You know why they're doing episodic games?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
It's because they go,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Ch-ching, ch-ching, oh, I can make some more money off this shit.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Great, let's put some more episodic content out there

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
because the last stuff's done so well so far.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Flaming Bozo in chat room says,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Grand Theft Auto IV is going episodic.

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
It has added content, but it has a full game before it.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I guess you could say Oblivion, in a way, is episodic.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Sort of, yeah.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
A little bit.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Well, it's the add-ons.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Shivering Isles is a bit of a new episode.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
Resistance will have episodic content, which I can, whatever.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Well, some of the episodic content you look forward to

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
in each and every episode of Orange Lounge Radio

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
is our mailbag.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
It's the part of the show where you can interact with us

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
simply by sending an email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
Dark Sakura will put some hand sanitizing rubber gloves on,

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
dive into the mailbag, and pull out her favorite emails

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
and her least favorite emails to read here on the air.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
So you can't send average emails because they don't get read.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
No.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
We try to read as many as we can,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
but since, you know, we're so popular and all.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Yeah, right.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
No, but sometimes we just get too many.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
We can't read them here on the program.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
But Dark Sakura does read them all.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Sometimes.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I read most of them, too, actually.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
So unless you're a spammer, then do not actually send this email

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
because we're banning IPs.

17:10.000 --> 17:16.000
Let's open up the mailbag, shall we?

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Well, we have three.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Dear O.L.R., I recently got a new gaming machine

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
and thought I'd send in a review.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
A couple weeks ago, I bought myself a shiny Commodore 128.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I'd been wanting to play a 64 for some time,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
largely due to the opinions expressed on your fine show,

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
but eventually the used market prices dropped on the 128 model

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
and I decided that it was worth a dollar to get a newer machine.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
I'm sure glad I did.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
What, Rob?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I love whoever wrote this already.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Finish it.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Just read the whole thing.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
This is beautiful.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Though having lesser system specs,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
the C128 still holds up well feature-wise

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
against other consoles on the market.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
It offers backwards compatibility,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
just like each of the major consoles on the market,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
and even supports homebrew, just like modified PSPs do,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
which so far only Microsoft seems to be interested in with their consoles.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
The C128 offers more buttons than any current console,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
and it is available in a stylish off-white color

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
similar to the DS Lite, Xbox 360, and Wii,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
although somewhat less glossy.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
Unfortunately, it still lacks some of the features of the other consoles.

18:18.000 --> 18:22.000
The 128 does not currently support HD output,

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
but it is not believed that the Commodore will be addressing that problem

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
through firmware or otherwise.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
The command mode basic interpreter is also a little bit more difficult to use

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
than, say, channels on the Wii,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
where everything is laid out for you,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
and you just point at what you want instead of typing

18:36.000 --> 18:42.000
load, quote, asterisk, quote, comma, eight,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
and cursing whenever you hit the wrong key

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
or the file list is longer than one screen.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
I remember that for a freaking load runner.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Of course, a system is only as good as the games that are on it,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
and while there are very few C128 games,

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
backwards compatibility means that I can enjoy any C64 game

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
I can get my hands on, of which there are many,

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
and if you know the discs haven't disintegrated over the last two decades,

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
which I understand is a problem,

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
I cannot seem to get Impossible Mission or The Last Ninja to work.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
I even tried blowing into them, but no such luck.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Overall, however, I find the Commodore 128 to be a fine addition

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
to my game console lineup,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
and I intend to have many more hours of fun with it.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
By right sucks, Warrior Bob.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Seriously, Warrior Bob, I want to have your baby.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
That was an awesome email.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Imagine, we could have a little house full of little VIC-20s

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
and plus fours and sixteens running around everywhere.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
You know, that email was beautiful.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Oh, he also sends another email to you.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Oh, really?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
You're a rock star.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Oh, we're so going to get it on with our Commodore.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
We should do some Commodore Live gaming,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
and we could play, God, what the hell could you play over the modem

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
on the Commodore 64 on my 300 baud modem

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
that plugged into the back of the Commodore 64?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
What kind of games could I play?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I guess over the local bulletin board systems.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
God, no, not even then.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I didn't really hit until I had an IBM.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Was there anything you could play over the modem on the Commodore 64?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Surely we had a modem for some reason.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I played a whole shitload of Kix.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Maybe there was.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Kix was my game.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
We'll get together and play some Kix.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Well, the last email comes from...

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Wait, you said three emails.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
I know, the second one was also from Warrior Bob.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Oh.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
This one's from Philly Girl.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Hi, Orange Lounge.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
I think you are the best podcast ever.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
You don't know how much I appreciate you guys,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
but on to what I'm emailing you.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I've got a dirty joke for you.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
What's six to eight inches long,

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
goes in and out of your mouth,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
and leaves the white stuff around your lips?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
A penis.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
A toothbrush.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
P.S., I've already signed up on your website

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
because you guys are so great.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
My screen name is Vanity Angel from DDR.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Thanks for putting this on the show.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
The email had nothing to do with video games.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Somebody just emailed us going,

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
hey, I want to tell you a dirty joke.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Pretty much.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
God, I love our listeners.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
In fact, that's even better.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
What you need to do is call our Skype line

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
or our toll-free number.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
And leave us a voicemail with your favorite dirty joke.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
That is a wonderful idea.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Let's have a little contest.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Let's see who can be the best OLR comedian.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Leave us a voicemail on our Skype line

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
or 800 number sometime during the week,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
and we'll play some of our favorites on next week's show.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Just don't forget to leave your name.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
There's a lot of good stuff.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
Toll-free.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
U.S. and Canada.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
U.K. Sorry, you guys are screwed.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
You're Australia.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
You guys got to use the regular Skype method to do it.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Orange launch radio on Skype.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
That's a beautiful idea.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
If they're video game jokes, that's even better.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
More points if it's video game themed.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Like dirty Princess Peach jokes.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
That would be great.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
This is also great, and it has nothing to do with porn

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
or emails or any of that.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Wow, there really wasn't that many emails this week.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
That's kind of sad.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
I cry.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
Yeah.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Aww.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Mail back to orangelaunchradio.com.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Send us more stuff.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
This is great.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Great, great news.

22:13.000 --> 22:19.000
Vivendi is looking to actually revive Sierra.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Oh, this is great news because Vivendi,

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
you know, years ago, they bought out Sierra or whatever

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
and they offshoot Sierra online.

22:27.000 --> 22:34.000
And now it looks like Vivendi is going to be reviving Sierra somewhat.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
Sierra, of course, is well known in the PC gaming segment,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
but the name is going to get ramped up in the next few years

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
with other games that were originally released on the Sierra brand.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
World in Conflict and Time Shift will be names that are coming out very soon

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
that will have the Sierra brand.

22:50.000 --> 22:55.000
Here's a quote here from Vivendi CEO Bruce Hack.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
Quote, the revival of the Sierra brand comes from product.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Over time, as our products become better and establish themselves

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
as perennial franchises, the name Sierra will be given a stronger life.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
As we move forward, our products get stronger,

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
and as they are established as franchises, the name Sierra will be strengthened.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
No news yet, though, on a new Police Quest game, which kind of makes me sad.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Or Leisure Suit Larry.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
Well, I guess, then again, Leisure Suit Larry went somewhere else, right?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
He went to a dirty, dirty place.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Yeah, I remember that console title a couple years ago.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
It wasn't that hot.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Or King's Quest.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
I mean, I know there's a fan project, don't get me wrong,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
the silver lining game, but who wouldn't?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I mean, even the guys behind that, I'm sure,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
would love to see something official as well to complement that, though.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
We'll see.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Yeah.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Anyways, in the meantime, if you can't get your King's Quest

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
or Leisure Suit Larry or Police Quest or Space Quest fix,

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
you can always get your Sam & Max fix.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
And, of course, they've already, I think they're up through Episode 6 now

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
of the first season of the Sam & Max episodic game.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
Well, if you don't want to download it via a download service,

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
you can play it when it comes to retail.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
And it actually is being, it's heading to retail,

24:08.000 --> 24:11.000
thanks to Joe Wood for the U.K.,

24:11.000 --> 24:14.000
and I forget who's doing it in the U.S.,

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
but you soon will be able to purchase Sam & Max,

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
and it will be available in August of 2007.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Comments from the chat room on the last story.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Sorry to deviate a little bit, but some interesting things on Sierra.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
James Patrick in chat says, please, Sierra is dead.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Sierra Studios, we're in the Sierra Mountains.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
That studio is closed.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
Therefore, Sierra, the real Sierra, is dead.

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
And the adventure company is the one bringing it over here to the United States.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
I love Sam & Max, and I don't know why I haven't played it yet.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
By the way, Sierra and Sam & Max have nothing to do with each other,

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
but the chat room is a little bit behind.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
There's a little bit of live lag, so there you have it.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Sorry, I had a complete and utter brain fart.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Why? What happened? Were you daydreaming during the show?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Is that what's going on?

25:07.000 --> 25:12.000
No, I did my Reiki class today, so I've been sort of out of it.

25:12.000 --> 25:18.000
Maybe me and Captain America can run off and have a family together.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
I'll pursue my massage therapy,

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
and he can have a successful business as a crime fighter.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
What the fuck?

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
Okay, so how about a story?

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
I'd like to see that in a comic.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
How about a story?

25:32.000 --> 25:39.000
No, how about more Jamie and Captain America slash fanfic?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
What?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
We'll name our family the Avengers.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
That's the custom license plate we'll have on our minivan.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
Can I please see this posted on fanfic.net or whatever that site is?

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
No, because anyone who writes any fanfiction at all

25:54.000 --> 26:02.000
involving any characterization of me will be sued for libel or something.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
No sense of humor.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
No, I have no sense of humor because it was stupid.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
Then make a character named Sark Dakra.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
No.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
I can see it now.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
They're barbecuing on a Weber grill that's painted to look like

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
the Captain America shield.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
That was stupid.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
How about the next?

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
Hey, you're the one that had a brain fart and derailed the show.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Shut up.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
No pie for you.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
I was going to get you pie.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
Anyway, story.

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
For anyone who likes their MMOs,

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Turbine is offering the former subscribers of the Dungeons & Dragons

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
online game a free weekend of gaming,

26:45.000 --> 26:50.000
actually which is over right now.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
But for those in Europe,

26:52.000 --> 26:58.000
you're going to get an additional bonus for 10 days of free gaming.

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
So you can enjoy their module 3.3.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
It's supposed to beef up their character stuff.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Also, for those who are currently subscribed,

27:10.000 --> 27:17.000
you will get 50% more experience and a plus one to loot found

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
and lots of live events.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
So basically they're saying,

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
we don't want to go out of business.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
So there you go.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
All righty.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
Well, changing gears completely here, talking about some,

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
well, maybe, I don't know, maybe they'll show D&D online at this.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Who knows?

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
But of course, the E for All Expo is being held October 18th

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
through the 21st at the LA Convention Center,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
which is where E3 used to be.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
And of course, E for All is supposed to be kind of like that public version

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
of E3, but we're not sure exactly how much like E3 it's going to be

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
because part of us are kind of thinking,

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
well, they probably won't actually show any new games there.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
They're just going to kind of show existing games and have tournaments.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Who knows what's going to happen?

28:01.000 --> 28:07.000
But we do know that Sony and Nintendo have both signed on board.

28:07.000 --> 28:11.000
So they are going to be appearing at the E for All Expo.

28:11.000 --> 28:16.000
Now, the Expo is actually only going to be in the south hall.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Now, those of you that went to E3 in the past know that

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Nintendo and Sony were traditionally in the west hall.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
So therefore, we know that Sony and Nintendo's boost will be

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
a little bit smaller than what we know from E3 past.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
But still, the fact that they are going really gives a boost,

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
I think, in some regards to the E for All Expo.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
If you want to go, hey, it's only $100,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
but the tickets are not currently on sale.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
They will be made available in the future, I guess.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
But certainly, Sony and Nintendo signing on

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
does really help out this new show.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
So we'll see what happens.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Will they be using Kensha Hall?

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
That would be fun.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
They'll probably have a gun show going on in Kensha Hall while this is going on.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
Gun show?

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
No, seriously.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
One time...

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
They should do Kensha Con.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
No, for real.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
Like, one year I went to the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary Convention

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
in Las Vegas, which is at the Las Vegas Convention Center.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
And we had the right side of the building for the costume contest,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
the live speakers, because they had people from the movie there and everything.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
And then the left side was a gun show.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
So you had people in fishnets and full...

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
For those that have seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
Full Dr. Frank-N-Furter garb and little Columbias in sequined outfits.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.000
People just basically dressed like fucking freaks,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
intermingling with the gun show people.

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
And the most hilarious part was that the ATM was in the gun show room.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
So if any Rocky people wanted money to buy their crap,

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
they had to actually go into the gun show and get pointed at

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
and stared at by the folks there.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
So I would love to see the gun show go on at the same...

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Or the doll show.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Because it's also inevitable that the gun show and the doll show is always together.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Have you noticed this?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
There's always, like, a gun show and a doll show.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
Or a bridal pair.

30:00.000 --> 30:04.000
Yeah, the gun show, the doll show, and the bridal pair.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Anyway, sorry.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
The Dolls with Guns show.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
That'd be funny.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
Anyways...

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
Poto says, Guns next to games?

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
Just what he who shall not be named once.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
Anyways, so there's a brand new game coming out now

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
that's probably one of those serious games

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
that will help kids deal with the complex emotions

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
surrounding marriage, or divorce in this case.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
The game is called Earthquake and Zipland

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
and it deals with a king and queen who are suddenly separated by

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
when this giant zipper that's held the two parts of the small island together

30:44.000 --> 30:51.000
has come apart and then your main character tries and tries and tries to

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
fix the island and combine them to bring the king and queen back together.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
But spoiler alert!

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
They don't.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
And there's no way that he can.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
So there you go.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
No way you can fix a marriage.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
You might as well throw yourself into the ocean and die.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Does the game tell you that, too?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
That's really pleasant.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
No, but that's where I took from it.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I could be wrong, but, you know.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Oh, okay.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
But then again, I'm not a 12-year-old that's played this game.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
I'm neither of those.

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Dark Soccer, do you think we need a game to help kids understand divorce?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Um, no.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
People just shouldn't get married.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.000
They should have an expo.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Seriously, think about it.

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
If, like, there was, like, no marriage, you know, none at all,

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
and everybody, you know, was just like, you know, had, like, common law deal

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
or, you know, then there wouldn't be a problem.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
Oh, well, Daddy decided that he and Mommy were going to break up,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
so he just moved out.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
No problem.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
They should find out that the reason that the island split in two

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
is because the king was having sex with some other chick.

31:58.000 --> 32:03.000
Daddy's moving in with Uncle Bob.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
I personally, I basically, my parents were divorced, you know,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
before I had any memory of them being married.

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
So I, from that point of view, I couldn't really say if a game would help with that

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
because I just always grew up understanding what divorce was.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
Seriously, my parents have been together ever since, you know, I was born.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
They were together for, like, you know, 15 years before I was born,

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
and they're still together today, and I need a game to help me understand

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
why they're still together after all these years.

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
What I don't get is why people who obviously hate each other's fucking guts,

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
oh, we're staying together for the kids.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
Meanwhile, you're giving them a fucking complex because you hate each other.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Why does Mommy and Daddy fight?

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Why do they hate each other?

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
You would all be happier if you'd just go ahead and get a divorce.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Well, I'm sure we'll be getting some e-mails on that one.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Mailbag.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
I don't believe in staying together for the children.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
I believe in giving the children a healthier environment to exist in.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
All right.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.000
Well, we'll see what kind of Pandora's Box that comment opens.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
I grew up just fine with my divorced parents, okay?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
All right.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
We'll see what happens.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
All right, anyway, we're going to see what happens with this, too.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
It's our Website of the Week.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
DarkSakura likes to surf the Internet every which way she possibly can every week,

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
and she finds a website suitable to share with the rest of you,

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
or in this week's case it may be a little bit unsuitable.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
We shall see.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
It's DarkSakura's website, what?

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
I heard about this site from you a long time ago.

33:30.000 --> 33:36.000
Don't say that because it's not in the proper context here.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
You're not giving it the proper context.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
You heard about it from me on a radio program a couple years ago.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
La, la, la, la, la.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Just play me my damn music.

33:45.000 --> 33:53.000
I'm going to go run and hide.

33:53.000 --> 34:01.000
The Website of the Week, again, is one that Rob mentioned a long time ago.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Mantis.net.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
Sorry.

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
Mantis are panties made for men, and they're frilly and lacy,

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
and you can get them high cut.

34:15.000 --> 34:22.000
You can get briefs, and you can get nylon or lace,

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
and they have all kinds of designs, and they have seven day ones,

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
and they're really pretty,

34:28.000 --> 34:33.000
and plus they're made spacious in the front for special needs of men.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
So, guys, if you want to be pretty,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
if you feel like being a little dressier than usual,

34:41.000 --> 34:52.000
you should go to mantis.net.

34:52.000 --> 34:57.000
Chat room, the answer to your question is no.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
That would be no.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
That's so wrong.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
I feel dirty.

35:07.000 --> 35:14.000
But you can still feel dirty yet pretty underneath, and no one knows but you.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
It's a great idea.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
I'm looking at the embroidered ones, and they have hearts on them or balloons.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
Hey, PowerShot Pinball Constructor is coming out for the Nintendo DS.

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
Oxygen Games just announced this coming out very soon,

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
because Metroid Prime Pinball did pretty well, so here we go.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
PowerShot Pinball Constructor.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
So I guess it sounds like you can make your own table in this game,

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
which sounds kind of cool.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Yeah, it has a table editor in it,

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
and of course that makes me think of pinball construction set on the Commodore 64.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Pinball is fucking awesome.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
So now you can make your own table.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
So that means if I wanted to make a table of nothing but like 50 bumpers,

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
I could do that.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Do you remember the hyperball machine, though?

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
All it was was nothing but multiball.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Oh, I don't remember that.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
It would just shoot out a bunch of balls,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
and you'd have to shoot them back down on the thing.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
If I wanted to build pinball machines,

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
I would get Dan to buy one and fix it for me.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
All right, well, now you can do it on the palm of your hand on the DS.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
There you go.

36:14.000 --> 36:21.000
Anyways, so Zelda co-creator Eiji Aonuma,

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
confirmed in an interview with Game Informer

36:24.000 --> 36:33.000
that Phantom Hourglass for the DS will feature an online multiplayer mode,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
and they didn't really see what it's going to feature,

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
but he did answer yes when they asked

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
if there was going to be online battles over the Nintendo Wi-Fi service.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
So that's interesting, I guess.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
Maybe I'm thinking it's going to be something like Four Swords, maybe.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
That would be kind of neat.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
I don't know.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
That would be pretty cool.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Four Swords was actually a really, really cool game.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.000
Four Swords was a much fun game on the GameCube.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.000
That game was awesome.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
When you could find people that had the advances and the cords

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
to play the damn game with, it was a fun game.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
I thought I heard...

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Now, I can't remember...

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Correct me if I'm wrong,

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
because I never played Four Swords Adventure or something like that.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
Did it have an online mode or something where someone...

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
There's a couple tri-forces on the map or something like that.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
I think we talked about this maybe last week,

37:23.000 --> 37:27.000
where you basically drew a path that this warrior thing follows or something.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.000
That's the multiplayer in the Zelda Phantom Hourglass.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
Oh, okay.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Yeah.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
I think that was Bobby telling us about him playing it at GDC.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
That's right.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
That's what he was saying.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
That's what we were hanging out with him last week.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
Yeah.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Anyways, so as Bobby was telling us from GDC,

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
it's basically there's a couple tri-forces on the map,

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
and you can't, I think, see the player if they have a tri-force

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
or don't have a tri-force, something like that.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
Basically, one player controls the three guards,

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
and you draw a path that they follow and stuff like that.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
It sounds interesting.

38:02.000 --> 38:07.000
It's kind of like that Pac-Man multiplayer game that was on the GameCube.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
Pac-Man Versus, which they so need on the Wii and online.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
Or on Xbox Live then, because if Nintendo's not going to do it,

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
then fucking put Pac-Man Versus on Xbox Live.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
That's what we should have gotten instead of old-school Pac-Man,

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
but that's just my opinion.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Yeah.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
What do I know?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
I don't know, Rob.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
What do you know?

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
How about some stuff?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
I know stuff.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
There is a little bit of information, though.

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
I know I'm not visiting your website of the week this week.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Rob.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Yeah?

38:39.000 --> 38:47.000
So there is an unholy union between In the Groove and Pump It Up.

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
It's like they got together after taking a lot of LSD and bread.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
So now there's a Pump It Up Pro.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Yeah.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
I'm not going to say anything else about that.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
God, where do I begin?

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
A, those of you that were saying that In the Groove was going to somehow be absorbed into Konami

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
and Dance Dance Revolution.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
No.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Was going to have In the Groove songs.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
No.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
And here's further proof that that ain't happening,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
because it's been absorbed into Pump It Up, it looks like.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
It's pretty much all the songs that were done by Kyle Ward are now on Pump It Up.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
That's about it.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
So in other words, Andy Mero threw a bunch of money at Kyle Ward, and that's it?

39:25.000 --> 39:30.000
Because Andy Mero, but Andy Mero and Roxor had, I guess, a working relationship, right?

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
Because those In the Groove 2 cabinets, of which I've still never seen one in my entire life,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
were made, well wait, I take that back.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
There might have been one at that 8 on the Break place in Jersey when I went there a long time ago.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
I can't remember.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
But regardless, Andy Mero made those cabinets for him, right?

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Yeah, I think so.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
So they already had a little bit of a working relationship.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
So this actually doesn't surprise me so much.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
Yeah, you're going to see songs like, for example, Oasis, as well as,

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
there's a bunch of other stuff I recognized on there when I was watching the videos of them.

40:03.000 --> 40:10.000
Exotica, Esperanza, let's see here, Destiny.

40:10.000 --> 40:15.000
It was a bunch of songs, I think, from In the Groove that were in there.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
I mean, don't get me wrong, I like some of Kyle Ward's songs.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
I really like the stuff he does under, what is it, Bonsai is the name?

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
The Zodiac and Anubis and all those songs.

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
But still, I don't know, it's just weird.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
And I know, like, Miggletove wanted to come on the show tonight, but he had to leave.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
I know he's a hardcore Pump It Up fan.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
He ain't happy about this.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Zodiac?

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
Is the In the Groove thing crossing over to Pump It Up?

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
I don't think it's really crossing over.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
I think it's more of just they have him now as an artist, and that's it.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
So he's taking his songs with them.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
I mean, the guy's got to work, so whatever.

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
That doesn't necessarily mean he's just, you know, it's In the Groove now.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
They did, I like what they've done with the interface.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
The interface is not retarded as it usually is on Pump.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
So that's kind of nice.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
But other than that, I don't really think it's In the Groove.

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
It's just that it's got, you know, Kyle Ward doing music for him.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Great.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Well, I think what's great about this is it just proves us right,

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
that those songs were not going to be ever showing up in DDR.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
In the Groove, DDR, right.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Alrighty.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
Let's see, if you would like to call us, we're going to open up the Skype line here very shortly,

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
because we encourage your interaction here on this program as well.

41:33.000 --> 41:38.000
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and our 800 number,

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
if you want to call us that way, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
It looks like we have some In on the Break fans or folks that live near there.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Blaze says, 8 on the Break for the win.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
DDR Dollar Bill says, yeah, 8 on the Break.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Rama says, Sky, that was a beta In the Groove 2.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
Chinatown Fair has In the Groove 2 and a Pump It Up box.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
So yeah, I went to 8 on the, I've been to 8 on the Break.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I want to say I've been there a couple times, actually.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
I think I went out there once randomly when I was on the East Coast.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
I went there again for some DDR tournament.

42:06.000 --> 42:12.000
And I played some game that was some beat game I'd never seen in my life.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I don't remember, sorry.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
Let's see, Shadow Charlie wants to know what happened.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Speaking of Zodiac, what happened to the Zodiac remix that Loki made

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
that was during the bonus segment of last week's show?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Check his community page on all games.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
It's there.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
And apparently 8 on the Break has 2 In the Groove 2 machines now.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
There you have it.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
All right, let's go ahead and head on over to the Skype line

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
and start taking some calls.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Ravenstaufen. Let me turn down the thing.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
All right, hi, Ravenstaufen. What's on your mind?

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I got a podcast now.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
You have a podcast now?

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Mm-hmm.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
Oh, God, everybody and their fucking mom has a podcast now.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Why should we listen to yours?

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
Because it's a tech podcast, Sky.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Something different.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
It's a tech podcast.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
This Week in Ravenstaufen?

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Sort of.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
What's it called?

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
It's called RavenstechReview.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
All right, and where can we access RavenstechReview?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
On the All Games forums.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
And it's being submitted to iTunes soon.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
Hope it's going to be up there.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
All right, we'll see.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Hopefully coming soon to the iTunes store.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Well, Raven, talk games with us because we don't...

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Well, I mean, we do talk tech, but we talk video games.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
What did you think of some of our stories tonight?

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
I think they're interesting, but you're missing one more.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
And I viewed it on my site.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
I'm sorry.

43:29.000 --> 43:32.000
It's the Commodore computer coming back.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
I didn't...

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
Because I think we hit...

43:34.000 --> 43:35.000
We talked about it last week.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Yeah, we talked about it last week.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
That's why.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
Oh, yeah, you did?

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Yeah, we did.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Yeah, that's all right.

43:40.000 --> 43:41.000
What do you think?

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
As a tech-inclined individual, what do you think of Commodore making a comeback in the,

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
I don't know, competing with Alienware or something market?

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
I think it's interesting.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
I don't know if it's going to be an operating system.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
You remember the Commodore had a different operating system than the DOS.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
Right.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.000
So I don't know what they're going to do.

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
I don't know if it's going to be Commodore just placed in there with a Windows operating system,

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
or they're going to go with something different.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.000
But it's interesting.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
Something tells me, since Commodore BASIC is very antiquated,

44:11.000 --> 44:16.000
I think you're going to just get a normal Windows PC in there.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
I was just interesting about that.

44:18.000 --> 44:24.000
And I'll tell you, I'm not going to miss syntax error one bit or load quote star quote comma eight comma one.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
I ain't going to miss that shit.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
I don't miss it at all, but two more things.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
The fuck did comma eight comma one mean anyway?

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
I have no idea.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Two more things.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
It was just their command line.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I think it was like the device number or something.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Well, why was the disk drive eight?

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
It was always eight.

44:41.000 --> 44:44.000
I think like once in a blue moon you might have seven.

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
But anyway, sorry.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
This would be This Week in Raven from 1984.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
You have to listen to it.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
What else is on your mind, Raven?

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Two more things on my mind.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Vampire for the Commodore 64.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
You ever played Vampire?

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
I'm familiar with the title, but I can't remember the game play.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Fun game.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
It's on game tab.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
I was going to say, I think it's on game tab.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
I think that's where I've seen it.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
I have not played it.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
What do you do in Vampire?

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And don't say you're a vampire.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
I am not a vampire.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
No, I meant in the game.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
This one goes to Dark Soccer.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
What?

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
Flintstones Pinball.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
You ever heard of it?

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
I think so.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I don't think I was very interested in it.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Was it based off the movie?

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Yeah, it was.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
I played that table once, and because it was the movie,

45:35.000 --> 45:41.000
it felt like I felt unclean after playing it.

45:41.000 --> 45:46.000
And I had to go change out of my manties.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Alright.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Bye Raven's Dolphin.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Take care.

45:50.000 --> 45:55.000
Alright, if you want to give us a call, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR,

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
or you can always call us on the Skype line, Orange Lounge Radio.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Alright, let's go to the phones and take another call.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Who's this?

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
I'll give you three guesses, and the first letters are J, A, and S.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Oh, it's Jazz.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
God, you haven't been on the show in a long time.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
No.

46:14.000 --> 46:15.000
Hi, Jason.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
What's on your mind?

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
You have to fail at spelling, Rob.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Jeez.

46:19.000 --> 46:25.000
Mr. VX JasonXV himself, our webmaster extraordinaire.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Extraordinaire.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
Hey, VX, our website held up amongst being on the front page

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
of Dig and Joystiq and Kotaku and all that stuff,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Destructoid and all that this week.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
So, good job.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
Really good to know.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
I've kept looking, and I've kept checking.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
I saw when you guys rumen always upsell.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
Crazy shit.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
Well, what do we owe this phone call to tonight?

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
I would love a new Space Quest game.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Who wouldn't?

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I would absolutely love it.

46:55.000 --> 46:59.000
But do you think it's actually going to happen?

46:59.000 --> 47:00.000
I don't know.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Haven't kept up.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
I just heard it, and I thought it was cool.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
How many games are in the Space Quest franchise?

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
I can't remember.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
Six.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Wow.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
So there were that many games in the Space Quest series?

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
I always thought there was only the three or four that were in it.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Wow.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
There was.

47:17.000 --> 47:20.000
The first four were all the keyboard navigational.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
The fifth actually introduced the mouse,

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
and then the sixth actually introduced the announcer

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
and even more interactivity.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Five was awesome.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
That's the first one I played.

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
I got the anthology and played the old ones,

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
and then I played six, and I was blown away

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
because it was a big difference, and it was so good.

47:38.000 --> 47:45.000
For the kids today who may have never played Space Quest in the past,

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
what makes this game so frickin' great?

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Humor.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
You have to read, but it's all in the humor,

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
and it's a great puzzle game.

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
All right.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
Let's see.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
We out?

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
I was just saying that's the best part about it.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
It is a funny game.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
It is very witty.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
It's great to read.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
It is a game that puts you through a book adventure,

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
and I loved it.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
All right.

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
Well, I hope Vivendi, Sierra, whoever hears your calls,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
and maybe will come out with something new,

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
but don't hold your breath.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Yeah.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
All right.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
I believe so.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
I beat Turtles Arcade at five o'clock in the morning.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Good job.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
Were you by yourself, or did you have a bunch of other people?

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
I was by myself.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
Oh, but you get unlimited continues by yourself.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
How many continues did you have to use?

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Oh, I don't even know.

48:45.000 --> 48:50.000
Call me back and brag when it's three or less, buddy.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
All right.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Just teasing.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Congratulations.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
It's fine.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
You know, actually, there's a YouTube I saw somewhere

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
of a guy running through the entire game on one credit.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
It was amazing.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
I don't know how anyone does it.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
A lot of people claim about, you know, single credit arcade runs,

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
and I know I don't have any game I could say I've done such a thing with.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Me neither.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
All right.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
All right, Jason.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Well, thanks for all you do for us,

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
and we're going to let you go so we can take some more calls, all righty?

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Sweet.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Later.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Have a good night.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
You too.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
All right.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
If you want to call us 1-877-GAME-OLR, remember it's your show, too.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
We want to hear what you guys have to say.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
So let's go to another call here on the Skype line.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
Who's this?

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Hey, this is Darkshi.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Hi, Darkshi?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Yeah.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.000
Ah, Darkshi.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
What's on your mind, my friend?

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
First I want to say it's kind of amazing.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
It's the first time on the air.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
I was going to say I don't recognize your name as calling in before.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
I know your name from chat, but you've never called in before,

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
so welcome, noob.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
What's on your mind?

49:57.000 --> 50:04.000
Well, first off, I just saw 300 today, and I heard of a game coming out.

50:04.000 --> 50:09.000
And my friend's all, so I saw, like, oh, it should be on PS3.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
It's so amazing it deserves to be on PS3.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
And I've never heard of it.

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Like, what?

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
It does sound a little bit like a fanboy's wet dream such as Kill Bill the game.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
If there's any game that's slated to come out, Loki would know about it.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
300?

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Are they really making a game out of 300?

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
Yeah, they did a PSP game, and it wasn't very good.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Oh, so there is a PSP game, huh?

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
Yeah.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
What do you do in the PSP game?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
You just hack and slash type stuff.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Put your ears through people's faces and all that fun stuff?

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
I guess.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
It didn't give very good reviews, and it came out a couple weeks ago, last week in February.

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
So, but you say your friend said it should come out on PS3.

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
Yeah, he said, like, oh, it's such a great game, and he's a PS3 fanboy.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
He wants every single game.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
Did he not get his PSP and his PS3 confused, maybe?

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
Because we don't know of its existence on PlayStation 3.

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
I told him, like, he said it deserves to be on PS3.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
He's saying, like, oh, it's so amazing.

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
At the same time, the PS3 wasn't all that great.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Well, you know, I think the movie's been doing very well.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
It was at the top of the box office again the second week in a row.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
I think it's inevitable you're going to see a sequel to 300 at some point.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Well, can you do a sequel to 300?

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
I guess not, because it's based on history, huh?

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
It's based on a comic series.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Oh, is it? Well, then there might, I guess, who knows?

51:26.000 --> 51:29.000
I haven't seen it. I'm not on the 300 fan wagon.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
I don't know if it's just one novel thing or something.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
Well, we'll see. So maybe, if possible, they'll have a sequel later on.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Otherwise, you'll see something like it.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
And who knows? Again, if it's tied into comics and they do more comics,

51:41.000 --> 51:46.000
it could be possible you get another game or two out of this a little later on down the line,

51:46.000 --> 51:49.000
especially with the movie being as popular as it is.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
Yeah, yeah. And I have one more thing.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Sure. What's up?

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
All right. I remember so, so many years ago about hearing about Phantom Hourglass,

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
and it just came out now, or coming out now,

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
and I'm like, is this like a tradition for the Zelda games or something?

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Yes.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Pretty much, sadly. Yeah.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Phantom Hourglass, they debuted at what?

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
Didn't they first show that off at E305, I almost want to say?

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Maybe it was E306.

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
It was either E306 or it was either that or Tokyo Game Show or something like that.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Yeah, it has been a long time.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
Yeah, it's pretty much tradition for the Zelda series at this point.

52:30.000 --> 52:35.000
Oh, except the CDI ones came out pretty quickly.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Just kidding. All right.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
Well, are you looking forward to Phantom Hourglass?

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
Yeah, I'm a big fan of Zelda.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
I don't own every game.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
What do you think about the multiplayer mode we were talking about?

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
Do you think it's going to be fun on the Internet?

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
I'm hoping so, because I can't really think of Zelda online,

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
so maybe they'll surprise me.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
It's hard to think about Nintendo online these days,

53:00.000 --> 53:05.000
but yeah, Zelda's definitely a step in the right direction, so we'll see.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Yeah.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
All right. Well, Darkside, thank you so much for the call,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
and call again sometime, all right?

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
All right.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Later.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
Have fun with Phantom Hourglass and all those hours you're going to be putting into that.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
All right, I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Sorry to those folks that did not get through.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
We apologize, but everybody's trying to hammer the line there, so it happens.

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
Let's see, going to the chat room, trying to read the comments there

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
to some of those previous calls we took.

53:34.000 --> 53:39.000
SSJ100Matt says, I hear the 300 game is awful.

53:39.000 --> 53:43.000
GS68 says, bring on the max 300 jokes.

53:43.000 --> 53:49.000
Let's see, SSJ100Matt says you could have 302 electric boogaloo.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
All right, there you have it.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
We'll take more calls next week.

53:53.000 --> 53:56.000
Of course, again, Loki's challenge to leave us a dirty joke on the Skype line,

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
that's open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
You can do that all week long.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
I'm going to go around and see if there's any last-minute stories

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
anybody would like to share tonight, last-minute stories.

54:08.000 --> 54:13.000
I've been trying to find the information on it, but I can't actually find it.

54:13.000 --> 54:17.000
There's actually a new pinball table coming out later this year

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
that's a Monty Python theme, and we're actually going to get it.

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Like a Spamalot table?

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
I don't know if it's Spamalot, because there's already a Holy Grail table.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
I thought that they were either going to do Meaning of Life or Life of Brian.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I think it's Meaning of Life.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I think that's pretty cool.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Always look on the bright side.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
That was Life of Brian.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
Yeah, I know, but you know.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
Meaning of Life had the...

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
It's just a way for thin mint.

54:45.000 --> 54:49.000
Wasn't Meaning of Life the one that was in the office building in the beginning?

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
That was actually a different...

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
It was supposed to be a lot shorter,

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
but unfortunately they let Terry Gilliam have his way,

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
and it was the...

55:01.000 --> 55:04.000
What was it? The Crimson something assurance?

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
I remember that scene going on forever.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
All forever a scene went on.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
I love that scene.

55:10.000 --> 55:11.000
Anyhow.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.000
Isn't it great to charter an accountant?

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
That one.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
The Rob D. says about the Monty Python table,

55:17.000 --> 55:21.000
every time you hit a bumper, I fart in your general direction.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Every time you hit a bumper.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
That's cute.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
And now for something completely different.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
Monty Python pinball table.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
That's a good name for a table.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Loki, anything from you?

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
Just a couple small things.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
One, Splatterhouse is supposed to be...

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
is confirmed apparently for Virtual Console this Monday.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
So we're going to be seeing that.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
I'm going to tell you right now,

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Splatterhouse is one of those games

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
you're going to think back to your childhood and go,

55:47.000 --> 55:48.000
this game was awesome,

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
but when you all downloaded on Monday,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
the game was not that good.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
It really wasn't.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
I remember how bad it was.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
But it's still funny though.

55:57.000 --> 56:01.000
If you want that Friday the 13th vibe to it.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
There you go.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Let's see what else here.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
Oh, apparently it started now on the PlayStation 3

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
on one of the previous firmwares.

56:12.000 --> 56:19.000
Up until 1.51, they're seeing holes

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
and they've exploited a TIFF exploit,

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
basically causing a buffer overflow like they did on the PSP

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
to run their own code.

56:29.000 --> 56:34.000
So it's only a matter of time before they break the PlayStation 3

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
and have piracy rampant on there as well as homebrew and stuff.

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
So I'm waiting.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
That's it.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.000
All right.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
And I don't have anything either.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
So I guess we're here to the end of the show.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
So that's it.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
I'll start.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.000
Loki, Loki, your final thought.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.000
My final thought is...

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I think I have some good games on Virtual Console.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
I haven't bought anything lately.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
My final thought is Moonkin Forum is only 15,000 experience away.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
Woot.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
And I'm a wow addict.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
DarkSakura, your final thought.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
We're finishing pretty fucking early.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Yeah, this is the short show tonight.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
It's kind of weird for us, but that's okay.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
It's been a compact and good show, a lot of information.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
We talked about it a lot in part A and part B.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
We'll do it all again next week.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
In the meantime, thank you guys so much for tuning into

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
and supporting independent internet radio.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
You guys are awesome, and it's because of you,

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
we continue to do this show every week in and week out.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
So we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio,

57:33.000 --> 57:37.000
March the 25th for episode number 225.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
Is that like a landmark number?

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
Because it's like a multiple of 25.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
I don't know.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
Not so much.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
All right.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
250 maybe.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
250 maybe.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Or our five-year birthday is just around the corner.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
I say we get a stripper for the fifth birthday.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
We'll see.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
All right.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Anyhow, in the meantime, that's it for this week.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
Tune in next week to find out which website calls us a liar next.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
That'll be fun.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Bye.
