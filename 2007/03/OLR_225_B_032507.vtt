00:19.640 --> 00:23.940
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on March 25th, 2007.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.140
We tape Orange Lounge Radio in two parts.

check our RSS feed for past shows and you can hear part A of this episode where we talked

00:33.860 --> 00:39.360
about the launch of the PlayStation 3, we talked about the black Xbox 360, and so on.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.200
When I say launch of the PlayStation 3, I mean in Europe, of course.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.200
Not here.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.880
That would be old news and we try to avoid old news if possible on this program.

00:46.880 --> 00:51.080
Dark Soccer is not here tonight and I was out of town for the past four days, so Lokiís

00:51.080 --> 00:55.240
taken over the news tonight and I am simply commenting here with Rice Princess whoís

00:55.240 --> 00:58.880
filled in tonight and is making the occasional comment while playing on the laptop.

00:58.880 --> 00:59.880
Mm-hmm.

00:59.880 --> 01:00.880
All right.

01:00.880 --> 01:01.880
Loki, take it away.

01:01.880 --> 01:02.880
All right.

01:02.880 --> 01:06.240
Well, this week we had some more news that wasnít really favorable for Sony and it was

01:06.240 --> 01:12.260
more exclusives leaving Sony and going to the Xbox 360, not necessarily being exclusive

01:12.260 --> 01:15.360
for the 360 but for now for both systems.

01:15.360 --> 01:20.840
So for example, the first title and actually big one, Devil May Cry 4, has been confirmed

01:20.840 --> 01:29.440
to be on the Xbox 360 and the PSP, or not PSP, PC, and that is confirmed according to

01:29.440 --> 01:31.120
Capcom Japan.

01:31.120 --> 01:34.580
So that sucks.

01:34.580 --> 01:42.800
And according to Xbox product manager of Microsoft Germany, Boris Schneider, Schneider John,

01:42.800 --> 01:48.400
I guess, hyphen in the name, Devil May Cry is only the first.

01:48.400 --> 01:56.200
There will be three exclusives total that are coming to the Xbox 360 and according to

01:56.200 --> 02:02.120
that I believe it was Final Fantasy 13 and Metal Gear Solid 4, the other two.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.720
Boy, that would be a one, two, three knockout.

02:04.720 --> 02:11.200
I mean honestly, Final Fantasy 13 for me is kind of one of the few things that Sony seems

02:11.200 --> 02:16.920
to be hanging on with right now because Xbox 360 kind of lacks really solid role playing,

02:16.920 --> 02:21.760
next gen role playing games right now, I mean sure you've got Enchanted Arm but that is,

02:21.760 --> 02:28.520
while it wasn't a bad game, it wasn't a OMG memorable, wonderful forever title and although

02:28.520 --> 02:32.880
Final Fantasy 13 may indeed suck, it is a Final Fantasy game, there's going to be people

02:32.880 --> 02:33.880
lined up for it.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.560
Now, to be fair though, this was in his blog post because I guess everybody keeps blogs

02:37.560 --> 02:38.560
nowadays.

02:38.560 --> 02:43.160
Oh sorry, chat room says Blue Dragon, yeah true, you got me there.

02:43.160 --> 02:48.720
And to be honest though, these are just kind of a shopping, a personal shopping list, it's

02:48.720 --> 02:54.600
not necessarily anything confirmed, this is just a rumor for now, but Devil May Cry 4

02:54.600 --> 03:00.480
is definitely, that's going to hurt and to be honest though, you kind of have to be stupid

03:00.480 --> 03:05.240
unless there's a lot of money on the table to release something just on Playstation 3,

03:05.240 --> 03:08.760
I mean especially if you're looking to sell lots of copies of it, there's just not that

03:08.760 --> 03:10.680
many units out there.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.360
For now, but we don't know what Sony might have in the pipeline.

03:13.360 --> 03:18.680
For now, and there's companies that are doing that, I mean look at Ubisoft for example,

03:18.680 --> 03:23.640
how long has Rainbow Six Vegas for the Playstation 3 been delayed?

03:23.640 --> 03:29.060
A long time, it originally was supposed to be coming out at launch, and then it was delayed

03:29.060 --> 03:36.400
to January, then February, then March, now I think April and possibly May, I mean that's

03:36.400 --> 03:40.720
yeah, they're really pushing it along until there's enough units out there and it will

03:40.720 --> 03:43.760
keep moving until Christmas if it has to.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.720
Can I be honest for a minute though, you know how sometimes folks assume because we do this

03:48.720 --> 03:52.860
podcast in our spare time and everything that we play every single game that's out there

03:52.860 --> 03:56.280
and stuff, but that's not true, we don't have time to play everything, I'm going to be honest,

03:56.280 --> 03:58.980
Devil May Cry is one of those series I never have played.

03:58.980 --> 04:02.500
As much as I would like, it looks fun, it looks interesting, I just have never really

04:02.500 --> 04:03.680
sat down and played it.

04:03.680 --> 04:08.800
So to me, this news just kind of made me go, meh, that sucks for Sony, but that was pretty

04:08.800 --> 04:12.640
much all I said, I wasn't really like, oh my god, you know this whole thing because

04:12.640 --> 04:17.040
I'm not super into Devil May Cry because again, it's one of those series I just haven't had

04:17.040 --> 04:18.120
a chance to get into.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.880
If they lose Final Fantasy 13, that's going to be fun.

04:20.880 --> 04:27.400
For me, that's a big deal because Metal Gear Solid, I am not that into that series as I

04:27.400 --> 04:32.400
am Final Fantasy, if Final Fantasy 13 is lost to the Xbox 360, I have zero reason to get

04:32.400 --> 04:33.400
a Playstation 3.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.400
Honestly.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.360
Um, my thinking though in this, and this is just kind of going back to what they did with

04:38.360 --> 04:42.880
the Final Fantasy 7 series, is that they're going to release a version on Playstation

04:42.880 --> 04:46.520
3 and they're going to release a different version on the Xbox 360, and then they're

04:46.520 --> 04:49.600
going to have something else on the PSP, and then they're going to have something else

04:49.600 --> 04:50.600
on the DS.

04:50.600 --> 04:55.960
You know, they kind of do these ten title releases for one game type of thing, you know,

04:55.960 --> 05:02.920
like they did with Final Fantasy 7, how uber ridiculous that was, so, I don't know.

05:02.920 --> 05:03.920
We'll have to see.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.080
And the game could suck.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.080
I don't know.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.080
Yeah.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.520
I mean, look at Dirge of Service, perfect example.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.440
So right now.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.440
James Patrick is in our chat right now and makes a few comments.

05:15.440 --> 05:21.600
Currently, by the way, chat.orangeonsrated.com, currently 360 has more JRPG's coming than

05:21.600 --> 05:24.840
Playstation 3 because of the whole Mistwalker alignment.

05:24.840 --> 05:30.240
Um, okay, I guess I could give that, although I don't, well Sony does have again the track

05:30.240 --> 05:31.240
record.

05:31.240 --> 05:34.640
That's kind of what I'm looking at right now with Playstation 2 and Xbox, and maybe that's

05:34.640 --> 05:38.800
not a fair comparison, but you kind of think that okay, well if it was that way before,

05:38.800 --> 05:42.120
but I get what you're saying, you know, they didn't have Mistwalker last time, and that's

05:42.120 --> 05:44.640
a pretty big something something, I'll give you that.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.280
Give me a break for forgetting Blue Dragon, I've been out of town the past four days.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.360
I'm going to keep using that as my excuse as much as I can.

05:50.360 --> 05:55.440
James Patrick says, also Final Fantasy 13 uses the white engine, Unreal Engine 3 is

05:55.440 --> 05:58.240
being used for something they haven't announced.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.720
But I would bet it's a spinoff.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.840
There is something else, they are going to be announcing something new during that May

06:04.840 --> 06:07.560
Final Fantasy party or whatever, so.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.560
Interesting.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.080
Jumpman says maybe Kingdom Hearts 3 for Unreal, I don't know.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.720
Or how about a new series out of Squeenix, I mean it wouldn't kill them to come up with

06:15.720 --> 06:17.560
a new series, would it?

06:17.560 --> 06:18.560
True.

06:18.560 --> 06:22.560
However though, fear not Sony, because not all is lost.

06:22.560 --> 06:29.800
In fact, you may remember, I don't know, a while ago there was a partnership between

06:29.800 --> 06:37.080
Namco Bandai and Sony called Celis, or Celius I guess, and it's a brand new partnership

06:37.080 --> 06:41.960
that they are creating some brand new games, including three games that have been announced

06:41.960 --> 06:45.680
so far and actually they showed up in Famitsu Magazine.

06:45.680 --> 06:51.720
Brave Arms, which appears to be like a third person action game, kind of like Ninja Gaiden.

06:51.720 --> 06:56.560
There was another game called Chain Limit, which is kind of a James Bond or Jack Bauer

06:56.560 --> 07:03.280
style spy adventure game, and second season one, which is a first person drama sci-fi

07:03.280 --> 07:04.840
action title.

07:04.840 --> 07:09.440
And I gotta say from looking at the screenshots of it in Famitsu Magazine, those look damn

07:09.440 --> 07:10.520
good.

07:10.520 --> 07:15.500
So way to go, I mean that's some good stuff right there, you know, they just need to have

07:15.500 --> 07:20.620
some more exclusive titles to them that look really nice, and you know, people will be

07:20.620 --> 07:21.620
all over that stuff.

07:21.620 --> 07:23.520
I mean, they look really nice.

07:23.520 --> 07:27.200
I can't wait for these games to come out.

07:27.200 --> 07:34.360
Anyways, so kind of moving along here, we've got some other interesting stuff.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.840
More upcoming games, not necessarily for the Playstation 3.

07:37.840 --> 07:43.120
Thing we talked about last week, Knights, which is rumored to be coming to the Wii and

07:43.120 --> 07:51.960
pretty much confirmed in the official Nintendo Magazine in the UK and other sources.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.040
But anyways, in other words, it's coming out, and if you think so at this point that it's

07:56.040 --> 07:59.320
not, you're an idiot, or you're the biggest conspiracy theorist in the world.

07:59.320 --> 08:00.320
It is coming out.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.320
Yes.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
Period.

08:02.320 --> 08:06.960
One person though that's not really interested in the new Knights game is Yuji Naka.

08:06.960 --> 08:14.760
And you know, basically saying that at the present, I have no such intentions to create

08:14.760 --> 08:20.000
another game in the franchise, so much like Katamari, it will probably live on without

08:20.000 --> 08:22.400
him.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.840
Bull deal.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.240
Let's see.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.720
Moving along though.

08:27.720 --> 08:31.320
Another game that's been in development forever.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.320
Duke Nukem Forever?

08:32.320 --> 08:33.320
Yes.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.320
Oh wow, I'm good.

08:34.320 --> 08:40.800
I didn't even peek, I promised I didn't peek over Loki's shoulder, I just kind of guessed.

08:40.800 --> 08:47.920
It's still plugging away, and basically 3D Realms admits to screwing up and promises

08:47.920 --> 08:53.840
that the new Duke Nukem game will be multi-platform, and hopefully will be out soon.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.840
Other info...

08:54.840 --> 08:58.840
Wasn't there some type of promise it was going to be out before the end of the year?

08:58.840 --> 08:59.840
I still remember.

08:59.840 --> 09:00.840
Was it last year?

09:00.840 --> 09:01.840
I don't know.

09:01.840 --> 09:02.840
Ah, fuck it.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.440
I don't even listen to them anymore.

09:04.440 --> 09:08.960
Some other interesting stuff though, it's rumored that the composer for Elder Scrolls

09:08.960 --> 09:13.920
Oblivion has jumped on board to score Duke Nukem Forever, and a couple of things hinting

09:13.920 --> 09:14.920
to that.

09:14.920 --> 09:19.880
The first developer, Raphael van Lietrop, it looks like, discussed in his blog about

09:19.880 --> 09:25.480
a recent visit from Julian Soule, the guy who did the score.

09:25.480 --> 09:30.520
Also an insider's only interview at IGN, Jeremy left one hint about his secretive upcoming

09:30.520 --> 09:31.640
project.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.920
He said, when it's done.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.920
That was another quote that they had for Duke Nukem Forever.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.640
Let's see if we can get him on the show, because we had some guy from that site where they

09:39.640 --> 09:43.940
sell his music previously on the program, and we were going to try and get an interview

09:43.940 --> 09:44.940
with that guy.

09:44.940 --> 09:47.160
Maybe we can try and beat him down for the details.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.960
These are excellent composers.

09:48.960 --> 09:53.520
Like Oblivion had some incredible music, and as did Prey, he did the music for that as

09:53.520 --> 09:54.520
well.

09:54.520 --> 09:58.880
Prey had some pretty awesome songs in it, but also Guild Wars has a really great soundtrack

09:58.880 --> 10:02.160
if you've ever listened to it, and he did that as well.

10:02.160 --> 10:06.900
That's pretty exciting if he's doing Duke Nukem Forever, but Oblivion and Guild Wars

10:06.900 --> 10:10.720
are very medieval type, have a certain sound to them.

10:10.720 --> 10:15.080
I would see Duke Nukem Forever's score sounding a little more like the Prey, but it could

10:15.080 --> 10:16.080
be interesting.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.080
It could be interesting.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.080
He's a talented guy.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.640
Well, since we're talking about stuff coming out, might as well start talking about what's

10:23.640 --> 10:27.680
coming out this week, and I'm going to start off here real quick with what's coming out

10:27.680 --> 10:34.080
in the UK, and you have lots of stuff this week, of course, with the PlayStation 3 launch

10:34.080 --> 10:40.580
and whatnot, but now though we've got some good stuff coming out for you, including we've

10:40.580 --> 10:46.120
got this week Gran Turismo 4 Mobile, although I would believe that when I see it, because

10:46.120 --> 10:47.600
I haven't heard anything about that.

10:47.600 --> 10:52.400
I'm not sure if I'll believe that, but God of War 2 is going to be coming out on PlayStation

10:52.400 --> 10:58.420
2, FEAR is coming out on PlayStation 3 for you guys, and I know that game has been delayed

10:58.420 --> 10:59.420
forever over here.

10:59.420 --> 11:01.420
Oh, I'm sorry, you're doing the Euro date, never mind.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.640
I was like, didn't God of War 2 already come out over here?

11:03.640 --> 11:05.160
Yes, it did.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.160
Just kidding!

11:06.160 --> 11:11.800
300 March of Glory is finally making its way out to the PSP, After Burner Black Falcon

11:11.800 --> 11:18.080
is also coming out, Bionicle Heroes for the Wii being put out by Eidos as well, Call of

11:18.080 --> 11:25.920
Duty Roads to Victory for the PSP, Command & Conquer 3 Tiberian Wars for the PC, and

11:25.920 --> 11:31.240
Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 coming out for the Wii, so that's a pretty cool lineup,

11:31.240 --> 11:35.000
also I guess looks like a heat seeker on the Wii and the PSP, hopefully that stuff comes

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
out here pretty soon, and Medal of Honor Vanguard on the Wii and PlayStation 2 will be out this

11:41.000 --> 11:46.480
week, as well as Test Drive Unlimited, and looks like Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell double

11:46.480 --> 11:50.140
agent as well on the PlayStation 3.

11:50.140 --> 11:56.240
For the US, we've got some good stuff coming out, of course this week, not a whole lot,

11:56.240 --> 12:00.700
got a few movie tie-ins, like for example, Meet the Robinsons got some games coming out

12:00.700 --> 12:06.480
for that, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox 360, the Wii, the DS, the Game Boy Advance, and

12:06.480 --> 12:15.080
PSP, so, you know, lots of systems for that game, and of course on PlayStation 2 and the

12:15.080 --> 12:20.740
Wii we have Medal of Honor Vanguard, which is going to be coming out, Metal Slug Anthology

12:20.740 --> 12:24.000
is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, hopefully this week, because it's been delayed

12:24.000 --> 12:33.520
a lot, let's see here, on the PlayStation 3, Splinter Cell double agent, so that should

12:33.520 --> 12:41.760
be coming out this week, on PC, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, the expansion to that, Shivering

12:41.760 --> 12:47.520
Isles, yes, that should be making its way on PC, we can actually buy that and then downloadable

12:47.520 --> 12:53.240
on the Xbox 360, fucking need to play more Oblivion, I really do, it was so incredible,

12:53.240 --> 12:58.280
I need to spend a hundred hours to just explore every nook and cranny, if you happen to be

12:58.280 --> 13:02.480
in the mood for some really weird PC titles, I've got a couple titles, I think these have

13:02.480 --> 13:09.160
to be my favorites for the week, Super Granny 3, on the PC, Rad, what are you doing Super

13:09.160 --> 13:18.680
Granny 3, I'm not sure, but it looks pretty awesome, apparently, Guild 3, Super Granny

13:18.680 --> 13:24.480
3, but that's still not my favorite title, my favorite title has to be this, Alien Disco

13:24.480 --> 13:30.760
Safari, that one is, that has to be my favorite title of the week, and that's going to be

13:30.760 --> 13:37.680
coming out, no idea, but maybe we'll see Super Granny 4 meets the Alien Disco Safari, Granny's

13:37.680 --> 13:44.920
Alien Disco Safari 4, yeah, maybe, winner, Cabela's Alien Disco Safari, alright, well

13:44.920 --> 13:47.760
I haven't been good for much this week, but at least maybe I can get out some Japanese

13:47.760 --> 13:51.600
release dates, would that be ok? Would you have any exclusives, by the way, I didn't

13:51.600 --> 13:55.840
hear any of the good stuff. You didn't really have too much to announce, of course, not

13:55.840 --> 13:59.560
a big surprise, I think this has been announced originally, they said they were doing Guitar

13:59.560 --> 14:05.200
Hero 80's edition or something, yeah, that was no surprise, you landed a date, but it

14:05.200 --> 14:11.720
was weird, we got linked from some punk rock music news site, linked that, a lot of folks

14:11.720 --> 14:14.840
kind of forgot that they've already said they're doing an 80's edition or they've hinted at

14:14.840 --> 14:21.280
it, so a lot of folks are taking that as news for the first time. Yeah, this stuff is nothing

14:21.280 --> 14:26.920
new, I just thought I'd point it out because everyone's got a big boner over Guitar Hero,

14:26.920 --> 14:32.760
especially with the new game coming out next week, so that's going to be big, I don't know,

14:32.760 --> 14:35.440
looking forward to more Guitar Hero, they're definitely keeping up with their promise with

14:35.440 --> 14:39.160
releasing multiple releases throughout the week, they're not the only franchise that's

14:39.160 --> 14:44.080
promised to do that, we'll get into that a little bit later. Japanese release dates,

14:44.080 --> 14:49.640
before I get into those, looking at the chat room here, let's see, Mecklar says Super Granny

14:49.640 --> 14:55.480
3, you have to save cats, that could be a joke, I don't know, and then Shadow Next Gen

14:55.480 --> 15:02.020
says Shivering Isles is coming out the day Xbox Live is down, lol, and Joshi16 follows

15:02.020 --> 15:06.360
up with that, it's only down for 14 hours, it's official, but don't those things usually

15:06.360 --> 15:11.920
take longer than they say they do? Yeah, apparently it's not for anything specific, they said

15:11.920 --> 15:17.080
they had a lot of work to do on the back end, so they're kind of doing that right now. Going

15:17.080 --> 15:22.680
back in chat to the Duke Nukem Forever chat, the Rob D from This Day in Gaming says I like

15:22.680 --> 15:26.960
how the creators of DNF, Duke Nukem Forever, actually take responsibility for screwing

15:26.960 --> 15:33.200
it up, they have no excuses, just we screwed up. Dark Sakura made a cameo on This Day in

15:33.200 --> 15:40.000
Gaming this week, by the way, check that out, it's hilarious. Japanese release dates, Xbox

15:40.000 --> 15:46.560
360 gets Absolute Blazing Infinity, Call of Duty 3, and Asia gets the release of Rayman

15:46.560 --> 15:56.020
Raving Rabbids all on the 29th of March. Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Mizase Suri Master

15:56.020 --> 16:01.400
is coming out from Hudson for the Nintendo Wii, and this looks to be some type of sports

16:01.400 --> 16:06.540
title that's coming out, it looks like it involves fishing, and hasn't this been announced

16:06.540 --> 16:11.120
for the US as some other name? Because it's all fishing, is what it is, some type of fishing

16:11.120 --> 16:16.720
game. I saw some screenshots for this. Maybe. Maybe somebody in chat room would know more

16:16.720 --> 16:22.880
information about that whole thing. Let's see, also coming out on the, well that's it.

16:22.880 --> 16:29.040
You can get some controller covers and stuff for like 5 bucks, 10 bucks on Nintendo Wii.

16:29.040 --> 16:32.760
I don't know if Rayman Raving Rabbids is coming out, because that's another game that they

16:32.760 --> 16:36.720
kind of delayed, it was very last minute too, it was supposed to be coming out this week,

16:36.720 --> 16:41.840
and then got moved to May. For the 360. For the 360. I don't know, we'll see. Coming out

16:41.840 --> 16:48.440
on the Playstation 3, Winning Post 7 Maximum 2007 on the 29th of March for the Playstation

16:48.440 --> 16:54.800
3, that's a horsey racing game. Enjoy your horsey racing if you are into that. Coming

16:54.800 --> 17:00.380
out over on the Playstation 2, Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix, I know a lot of folks are very

17:00.380 --> 17:06.280
excited about that. Vitamin X. I like the name of this game. Vitamin X is coming out.

17:06.280 --> 17:09.680
There's also a limited edition available. I'm not sure if this is based on an anime

17:09.680 --> 17:13.480
or what, because I haven't been keeping tabs on my anime, but it's certainly got one of

17:13.480 --> 17:16.680
those covers. Rice Princess, you know a lot about anime. Is Vitamin X an anime? I've never

17:16.680 --> 17:21.560
heard of it. I think so. Vitamin X? I don't know, it's got a little cover there. It's

17:21.560 --> 17:26.040
an action game. It's not ringing a bell for me. Maybe somebody in chat knows. Couldn't

17:26.040 --> 17:30.440
tell you that one there. But also, this other one, this sounds like a very interesting game

17:30.440 --> 17:37.300
coming out in Japan. Gaokan Utopia, Manabe Straight, Kira Kira Happy Festa is coming

17:37.300 --> 17:42.440
out. And this is an adventure game with a bunch of girly anime characters on the cover.

17:42.440 --> 17:47.760
Looks like a chibi punch and kick game. But it has a cute name. Yay. So, have fun with

17:47.760 --> 17:52.000
that. Let's see if anything else is coming out on the other systems. Oh, Nintendo DS,

17:52.000 --> 17:57.360
Digimon. Two Digimon games coming out from Bandai. Moonlight and Sunburst. It doesn't

17:57.360 --> 18:01.560
really say what Vitamin X is, but it says it's a love adventure game by D3. Oh, a love

18:01.560 --> 18:07.240
adventure game, huh? Does that mean it's like a dating sim? I don't know. Maybe. We'll see.

18:07.240 --> 18:12.100
That's pretty much all I got for you guys over in Japan. Have fun with your chibi girly

18:12.100 --> 18:17.480
fighting game. Well, the U.S. is going to see something else coming soon to your local

18:17.480 --> 18:26.840
video store, I guess. Blu-ray release of the classic video game and arcade classic, Dragon's

18:26.840 --> 18:32.840
Lair will be coming out soon. And not really a big surprise because it's been out on DVD

18:32.840 --> 18:38.280
for a while now. And they expect that it's going to be on HD DVD at some point and it's

18:38.280 --> 18:43.960
going to be sold for $49.95. Yikes. That's quite expensive. I don't know how you could

18:43.960 --> 18:48.400
really, well, I don't know. I thought the graphics were probably as good as you can

18:48.400 --> 18:54.080
get on Dragon's Lair. They can't really enhance it anymore. It seems a little bit pointless

18:54.080 --> 19:01.760
to me. I mean, you know, Dragon's Lair has kind of already been done, you know, on DVD

19:01.760 --> 19:07.400
and that's about as good. I mean, the original was on LaserDisc and it wasn't that pretty.

19:07.400 --> 19:12.200
I mean, did they clean it up? Did they do anything to it? Not that I can see. Interesting.

19:12.200 --> 19:20.960
Well, there you have it. Is Dragon's Lair a reason to buy a $600 PlayStation 3? No. Yes,

19:20.960 --> 19:27.160
says Miklotov. Miklotov's just fucking with us. He's just kidding. Now release Super Granny

19:27.160 --> 19:31.900
3 on Blu-ray and we're talking. Or Ultimate Duck Hunter from the bonus segment tonight

19:31.900 --> 19:36.520
or whatever the fuck that game was. Ultimate Duck Hunting. Ultimate Duck Hunting. You'll

19:36.520 --> 19:42.080
either kill the ducks or they will kill you. That's right. Wouldn't that be funny if like

19:42.080 --> 19:47.800
Ultimate Duck Hunting like kind of was a little bit like Donnie Darko or something like that,

19:47.800 --> 19:53.720
you know, where it's like a lot of head games and stuff. That would be awesome. And it has

19:53.720 --> 19:58.680
what? What did you say about Jake Gyllenhaal over there? I'm sorry. I'm having private

19:58.680 --> 20:01.900
message chat with other people in our channel. Well, he was saying something about Donnie

20:01.900 --> 20:06.120
Darko and I said some other words and then I said Jake Gyllenhaal because he's in it

20:06.120 --> 20:11.320
and he's hot. He totally is. I should totally option Ultimate Duck Hunting for a movie.

20:11.320 --> 20:17.920
I bet they'd sell the rights pretty cheap. You never know. Anyways, so speaking of stuff

20:17.920 --> 20:23.160
that's been delayed, Calling All Cars, brand new game that's supposed to be coming out

20:23.160 --> 20:27.840
to the Playstation Network. It's going to be one of their downloadable games. It's been

20:27.840 --> 20:35.480
moved to April and this is done by the same guy that did God of War, David Jeff. Basically,

20:35.480 --> 20:40.380
I don't know, he's just hit a roadblock, you know, as far as putting it out on the Playstation

20:40.380 --> 20:45.240
Network. Never really given any reasons why. He did have some gameplay footage of it and

20:45.240 --> 20:49.840
it did look all that pretty. And he said though, I mean, he's not trying to compete with like

20:49.840 --> 20:56.920
a Halo or anything or even God of War with us. I'm still saying it looks like crap. And

20:56.920 --> 21:00.680
he says it's all about the fun factor. It did not look fun at all. It looked pretty

21:00.680 --> 21:07.600
boring. So, hopefully I'm wrong and it'll come out to be pretty fun. I don't know. We'll

21:07.600 --> 21:12.840
have to see. Hopefully they release a demo. Another game that's getting yet another release,

21:12.840 --> 21:17.640
especially next week, they have Sing Star Pop coming out over here. Well, that's not

21:17.640 --> 21:22.320
all. They're going to be seeing six Sing Stars come out by next year.

21:22.320 --> 21:25.600
Oh, nice. On Playstation 2 or Mix?

21:25.600 --> 21:29.360
Think both because I know Playstation 3 is getting Sing Star coming out in June.

21:29.360 --> 21:34.240
But wasn't Playstation 3 only supposed to get like one Sing Star and that's it? And

21:34.240 --> 21:35.880
then they download everything with that?

21:35.880 --> 21:40.560
Well, I think so. I mean, but then again, I mean, you never know. Remember originally

21:40.560 --> 21:44.200
Karaoke Revolution was going to have add ons to it and that never happened. They figured

21:44.200 --> 21:48.180
out, Hey, we got like a couple packs here, a couple packs there. We can sell whole games

21:48.180 --> 21:53.560
and make more money. So yeah, that's scary. And I'm not playing any of them.

21:53.560 --> 21:57.540
Yeah. Act Deft was asking in chat the ultimate question. Will Loki buy it?

21:57.540 --> 21:58.540
I will not touch it.

21:58.540 --> 21:59.540
And will we put it on YouTube?

21:59.540 --> 22:04.000
No, I will not touch this game. Even if I get it free, I will be burning it. Yeah. It's

22:04.000 --> 22:12.320
a horrible, horrible, horrible game. Karaoke is awful. Now, of course, you know, stuff

22:12.320 --> 22:16.960
being delayed and stuff. We've been delaying the mailbag for a while. So Rob, why don't

22:16.960 --> 22:23.000
you make yourself useful and take Jamie's job, put on the gloves and dive into the mailbag.

22:23.000 --> 22:31.840
Sure. Why not? It's the least I could do for my dear friend Loki.

22:31.840 --> 22:35.860
Mailbag orange lounge trader.com. If you'd like to send us an email, I just randomly

22:35.860 --> 22:39.620
picked a few emails for this week. So I apologize if I didn't get to you tonight, you'll just

22:39.620 --> 22:44.520
have to deal with that rejection. Let's start with an email from Meglar who writes to say,

22:44.520 --> 22:48.740
just a quick email to say you rock. And a quick little tidbit. I heard from a friend

22:48.740 --> 22:54.340
who recently left the employment of Sega Knights is coming to the Wii, but also seems to be

22:54.340 --> 22:59.780
heading to the PlayStation three and Xbox three 62. Seems to her the game now plays

22:59.780 --> 23:03.900
like, Oh God, he just gave away who it is. I mean, how many female employees have just

23:03.900 --> 23:08.620
recently left Sega? I don't know. Seems to her the game now plays like the magic carpet

23:08.620 --> 23:12.800
from Sonic and the secret rings. Either way, it's something I'd not heard before. How about

23:12.800 --> 23:17.580
you guys and gal? Definitely. I knew about the Wii through something similar, like a

23:17.580 --> 23:23.860
friend of a friend at Sega, but I did not hear of PlayStation three and Xbox three 60.

23:23.860 --> 23:28.260
Very interesting. If true, it makes sense though. It does make sense. I mean, you know,

23:28.260 --> 23:30.500
Sega Knights is one of those franchises. I think people have been wanting to see come

23:30.500 --> 23:37.300
back for awhile. So very interesting. I want new rez. Me too, but too bad it's a different

23:37.300 --> 23:42.540
company altogether. Well, thank you for the email. Uh, we have an email from, uh, Sakura

23:42.540 --> 23:49.500
max says, dear OLR first order of business, Rob, don't be such a tit. Stop the accent.

23:49.500 --> 23:54.180
You disgrace my friends. Somebody is taking issue to my British accent. I do hit on the

23:54.180 --> 23:59.380
program. Sometimes don't be such a tit about it. Just teasing. I guess part of the charm

23:59.380 --> 24:03.020
is that my accents are so horrible. I don't know what else to tell you. Uh, second order

24:03.020 --> 24:08.420
of business, Jamie, the reason I say Rondo of blood sucks is because it's on PSP. One

24:08.420 --> 24:13.100
of the consoles I don't own and I've lost my loyalty to Sony. I don't know though with

24:13.100 --> 24:15.820
it, with some of these big games, it seems like they're trying to woo some people back

24:15.820 --> 24:21.580
to PSP. Is it too little too late? Yes. You think so? I was there a story this week and

24:21.580 --> 24:24.380
I don't know if it's something upcoming. Forgive me, but I want to say I read something on

24:24.380 --> 24:28.020
the internet before I left for my trip that said that retailers getting pissed that Sony

24:28.020 --> 24:31.760
will not do a price cut on the PSP and some are threatening to, to just get the damn thing

24:31.760 --> 24:36.460
off their shelves. Yeah. I was at the PlayStation, um, or destination PlayStation show. Apparently

24:36.460 --> 24:43.220
they were demanding that the price be, uh, lowered for the system. I did see though what

24:43.220 --> 24:48.940
they were, the GameStop was doing a special this week. They had, uh, the, was it the,

24:48.940 --> 24:52.580
they had like a bundle pack a long time ago. Remember when the PlayStation or portable

24:52.580 --> 24:56.460
first came out where it had like the case and the memory stick and stuff like that.

24:56.460 --> 25:02.460
Apparently now they don't have that. The core system is just PSP charger done, you know,

25:02.460 --> 25:08.180
so now, um, they were offering that one at $1.99 cause originally it was $2.50. So there

25:08.180 --> 25:13.460
was kind of a markdown, but yeah, well I think they're, they're probably going to redesign

25:13.460 --> 25:19.620
it or something. So get people to buy it again. All right, well there you go. Uh, sorry. Dark

25:19.620 --> 25:22.780
Soccer was not here tonight to respond to your comment, but if we remember, we'll tell

25:22.780 --> 25:27.900
her next week. Uh, third order of business. I just got DDR Supernova in my arcade. Congratulations

25:27.900 --> 25:32.620
on being about six months late to that party. Just kidding. Fourth order of business. DDR

25:32.620 --> 25:38.020
Supernova might not be too good considering the fact that the first one wasn't too successful.

25:38.020 --> 25:43.740
I'm not, I'm not, yeah, I don't sure I understand that statement because what, what first one

25:43.740 --> 25:48.720
are we basing it off of? Oh, do we mean like DDR Supernova at home? Assuming there's going

25:48.720 --> 25:52.900
to be a second mix this year, which I can't possibly see how there wouldn't be one. DDR

25:52.900 --> 25:57.540
Supernova, um, still one of the top selling titles actually out there. I'm surprised every

25:57.540 --> 26:02.820
time I see that too. Well, there you have it. I'm not, it's a very, it's, it's not something

26:02.820 --> 26:07.320
the hardcore players go for, but for the family game, like when mom and dad are looking for

26:07.320 --> 26:10.840
a game to buy the young kids for their birthday, I'm sure DDR jumps out, jumps off shelves

26:10.840 --> 26:15.380
for that reason. Yeah, we think he means Supernova 2 arcade. He just left a two off there. So

26:15.380 --> 26:20.680
whatever. Uh, Sakura Max is the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old and signs that email

26:20.680 --> 26:26.500
and says PS desk cap. I don't know. That's, that's what he says in his email. He says

26:26.500 --> 26:30.500
the youngest OLR listener at 12 years old. Do your parents know you listen to this? Shame

26:30.500 --> 26:35.500
on you. That, uh, closing statement right there just makes you realize why 12 year olds

26:35.500 --> 26:48.260
shouldn't be on the internet. Ouch. All right. Wow. You're so awesome. Totally awesome. Um,

26:48.260 --> 26:53.780
more emails. We have a email from, I, uh, I horribly apologize if I'm mispronouncing

26:53.780 --> 27:00.780
his name. Nate and a I F could be knife. Nate, I think it's Nate. Uh, Hey guys, I really

27:00.780 --> 27:05.020
love your show and I think it's one of the best shows on the web dealing with video games.

27:05.020 --> 27:09.820
This week you asked us to send you our favorite jokes. Well, this is my all time favorite

27:09.820 --> 27:14.300
joke because remember last week we had the email. I completely forgot about last week.

27:14.300 --> 27:19.460
Well, here we go. We got a, we got a joke back. So we do remember we said voicemail,

27:19.460 --> 27:22.020
not email, but well, that's all right. We'll take it cause I don't think we got really

27:22.020 --> 27:26.740
any voicemails. So I don't know. I didn't check again. I've been kind of gone. Uh, so

27:26.740 --> 27:31.700
here we go. Uh, I know it's an old one, but every time I tell it to my friends, they really

27:31.700 --> 27:35.380
enjoy it. And I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did. So we'll, we'll, uh, rice princess

27:35.380 --> 27:40.460
and a Loki and Michael top will be our judges on how funny this joke is. It's like American

27:40.460 --> 27:43.780
idol for jokes. That'd be funny. Something like that. Although I kind of feel like we

27:43.780 --> 27:48.940
should have like some music that plays with this or something. So maybe we should have

27:48.940 --> 27:51.920
some joke telling music while we read the rest of this email. I'm going to play some

27:51.920 --> 27:58.920
joke telling music. You ready? One day the teacher walks into her classroom and announces

27:58.920 --> 28:02.800
to the class that on each Friday she will ask a question to the class. And anyone who

28:02.800 --> 28:07.040
answers correctly doesn't have to go to school the following Monday. On the first Friday,

28:07.040 --> 28:11.440
the teacher asks, how many grains of sand are in the beach? Needless to say, no one

28:11.440 --> 28:16.440
could answer the following Friday. The teacher asks the class, how many stars are in the

28:16.440 --> 28:22.440
sky? And again, no one could answer frustrated. Little Johnny decides that the next Friday,

28:22.440 --> 28:27.440
he would somehow answer the question and get a three day weekend. So Thursday, Friday,

28:27.440 --> 28:32.880
Thursday, Thursday night, Johnny takes two ping pong balls and paints them black. The

28:32.880 --> 28:36.880
next day he brings them to school in a paper bag. At the end of the day, just when the

28:36.880 --> 28:41.640
teacher says, here's this week's question, Johnny empties the bag to the floor, sending

28:41.640 --> 28:46.120
the ping pong balls rolling to the front of the room because they are young kids who find

28:46.120 --> 28:52.160
any disruption of class amusing. The entire class starts laughing. The teacher says, okay,

28:52.160 --> 28:58.920
who's the comedian with the black balls? Immediately, Little Johnny stands up and says, Bill Cosby,

28:58.920 --> 29:05.780
see you on Tuesday. That's pretty funny. I got one laugh in the room, a little chuckle

29:05.780 --> 29:10.520
from Loki. Bacon. Are you laughing at the bacon or are you laughing at the joke? Joke.

29:10.520 --> 29:14.240
All right. Let's go around and judge that scale on one to ten. It'll be like the gong

29:14.240 --> 29:17.960
show here. Are we going to gong the joke? Rice Princess, on a scale of one to ten, how

29:17.960 --> 29:27.080
was the joke? W. W? Yeah. Okay. Loki, on a scale of one to ten, how was that joke? It

29:27.080 --> 29:32.440
would be like a seven. It's definitely no intelligent joke. I haven't heard it before,

29:32.440 --> 29:40.600
so props for that. All right. And Mikolaj. One. All right. Why such a low score? Because

29:40.600 --> 29:44.920
talking about Bill Cosby's balls is never a good thing and it's not funny. It's gross.

29:44.920 --> 29:48.960
There you go. All right. Do you think this is going to encourage people to send us more

29:48.960 --> 29:55.800
jokes? I have no idea. Ten for the bacon. All right. See, we all laughed at that. That

29:55.800 --> 30:03.200
joke got a ten. Good job, Loki. See, none of you comedians will ever be as good as Loki.

30:03.200 --> 30:07.480
Last email this week from our friend, DNL, also known as Renee. She's been on this show

30:07.480 --> 30:11.040
before, but it's been a long time since she's been on the program. I know Renee is great.

30:11.040 --> 30:16.120
Hi, OLR. This is DNL. I currently work at Perpetual Entertainment as an associate producer.

30:16.120 --> 30:19.840
As you guys liked MMORPGs, I thought you might be interested in the game I'm working on called

30:19.840 --> 30:25.080
Gods and Heroes Rome Rising. A brief description of our game is a massively multiplayer online

30:25.080 --> 30:29.180
role playing game set to Roman mythology. Excuse me. I have the hiccups during this poor

30:29.180 --> 30:34.360
email. Some key features is being able to play your hero character however you like

30:34.360 --> 30:39.080
with six different classes and an extensive character customization. You also get to control

30:39.080 --> 30:45.160
up to eight minions at a time, as well as have a visceral experience. I like DNL's use

30:45.160 --> 30:49.520
of vis, where is there? Visceral? What's visceral? I don't know. I'm probably pronouncing

30:49.520 --> 30:55.520
you wrong. What do you mean, visceral? Visceral. Yeah, sure. Visceral experience. Visceral.

30:55.520 --> 31:03.800
Ten. I hate you all. This is Dark Sakura, never leave me again. With paired combat animation.

31:03.800 --> 31:08.400
If interested, please sign up in our very active forums at community.godsandheroes.com.

31:08.400 --> 31:12.960
Seven pointy things DNL. So I like how DNL is using our mailbag to spam her game, but

31:12.960 --> 31:17.960
we'll give her that right here. In fact, why doesn't DNL get us an interview with peoples

31:17.960 --> 31:21.900
from the game? We'll take them. Now if I can do anything and I can control up to eight

31:21.900 --> 31:28.020
minions, can I like sit back and like drink ale and have my minions like kill things while

31:28.020 --> 31:31.880
I just sit there and not do anything? Do I get level, you know, experience points for

31:31.880 --> 31:38.480
that? I guess, I don't know. Folks, let's see, blackboy in chat says, wait, Sky's reading

31:38.480 --> 31:42.400
an ad that was thinly disguised as an email. Yeah, I guess, but it was from a friend of

31:42.400 --> 31:47.400
ours so I'm okay with it. And it's a game I hadn't heard about before, so there you

31:47.400 --> 31:52.400
have it. We'll check it out and give an honest opinion either way. So there you have it,

31:52.400 --> 31:57.040
that's it for the mailbag. Mailbag at orangelaunchrater.com if you'd like to send us emails. Well earlier

31:57.040 --> 32:02.480
we were talking a little bit, we mentioned that the Shivering Isles was coming out for

32:02.480 --> 32:08.280
the Xbox, well for Oblivion on PC and Xbox 360, but it was going to be downloadable on

32:08.280 --> 32:14.120
the 360. Conveniently enough, there is some other stuff you can download off of Microsoft's

32:14.120 --> 32:21.640
marketplace. Well, no, you cannot download porn, as Mikul Tov would say. That's not available

32:21.640 --> 32:28.080
yet. However, they do need a porno channel on the IPTV thing. That would sell systems.

32:28.080 --> 32:35.640
Anyways, Jetpack, or the new Jetpack game is coming out, if you might remember Rare's

32:35.640 --> 32:42.320
kind of little logo there. But anyways, Jetpack Refueled will be hitting the marketplace on

32:42.320 --> 32:51.000
Wednesday and it will feature obscenely colorful graphics, whatever that's supposed to mean.

32:51.000 --> 33:03.360
That's obscene. 128 levels, multiplayer capabilities, the original arcade version, and continued

33:03.360 --> 33:10.440
exclusion of the letter K from the title. And money shots, says Mikul Tov. It will be

33:10.440 --> 33:16.560
available on the marketplace and will cost you 400 Microsoft points or $5 in real money.

33:16.560 --> 33:20.840
Mikul Tov, you're giving this the thumbs down, is this one of those other games you've probably

33:20.840 --> 33:24.200
played that you're not supposed to talk about? Does it suck? Can you talk about it?

33:24.200 --> 33:25.200
It sucks.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.000
Mikul Tov says, why does it suck?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.560
Because it's not fun to play.

33:29.560 --> 33:30.560
What the hell do you do?

33:30.560 --> 33:34.200
You shoot things and then you fly away and it's really boring and it's not Boom Boom

33:34.200 --> 33:36.680
Rocket, so why are we talking about it?

33:36.680 --> 33:37.760
Well, the people want to know.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.320
Well, they don't anymore.

33:40.320 --> 33:43.200
Thank you very much, I suppose.

33:43.200 --> 33:54.520
On the Xbox Live Marketplace, they had brand new heroes and villains that you could download

33:54.520 --> 34:02.200
to expand Marvel Ultimate Alliance. It featured eight new playable characters, including the

34:02.200 --> 34:12.040
Incredible Hulk, Magneto, Hawkeye, Sabretooth, Doctor Doom, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, and Venom.

34:12.040 --> 34:20.120
They've got brand new signature powers, skins, dialogue conversations, and achievement points.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.120
New achievement points.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.120
Isn't that a Cyclops one-eye?

34:22.120 --> 34:25.800
No.

34:25.800 --> 34:29.160
Total porn on Xbox Live Marketplace. Now they want you to download one-eyed monsters on

34:29.160 --> 34:35.880
Xbox Live. Does he blast stuff out of his one-eye? Total porn is what the Xbox 360 is

34:35.880 --> 34:36.880
turning to.

34:36.880 --> 34:37.880
He doesn't have one eye. God.

34:37.880 --> 34:38.880
Does the Cyclops mean one eye?

34:38.880 --> 34:43.680
It's a one-eyed monster that shoots things.

34:43.680 --> 34:46.480
Like a penis.

34:46.480 --> 34:48.920
You can, it's basically they have it divided up into two different packs.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.240
Now, there's no need to go there, Rise Princess. That's just dirty. It's disgusting.

34:52.240 --> 35:00.360
They have a hero and villain pack, each of which were 500 points, or $6.25. Otherwise,

35:00.360 --> 35:06.440
you can also buy the combo pack, which features both, and save a little bit of money. It's

35:06.440 --> 35:12.640
800 Microsoft points, or $10. So, saving a good $2.50 there.

35:12.640 --> 35:18.400
And also, they have heroes and villains gamer picks that you can download, and those are

35:18.400 --> 35:22.680
each 80 Microsoft points, or $1.

35:22.680 --> 35:27.440
And Chat Room, yes. I was kidding. Of course, I know who Cyclops is. I did see the X-Men

35:27.440 --> 35:32.440
movies. I watched the cartoon when I was a kid. Please. James Marsters.

35:32.440 --> 35:36.040
Anyways, now let's talk about a game.

35:36.040 --> 35:39.160
Why are you laughing at me?

35:39.160 --> 35:40.320
Because you're funny.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.320
And Visceral.

35:41.320 --> 35:45.320
Go to hell.

35:45.320 --> 35:55.880
Now let's talk about a game that came out a couple of weeks ago. Ghost Recon 2. Apparently,

35:55.880 --> 36:00.920
Mexico doesn't like the game too much. I guess it has something to do with the Mexican terrorists

36:00.920 --> 36:01.920
in the game.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.060
Fuck Mexico. Sorry, Act Deft. Sorry.

36:04.060 --> 36:09.120
I think what's most interesting about this story, though, because apparently the game

36:09.120 --> 36:15.120
has been blacklisted, and I want to say Chihuahua, Mexico. Is there such a thing as a chihuahua

36:15.120 --> 36:16.520
Mexico?

36:16.520 --> 36:21.280
Yes, but it has nothing to do with the dog. I mean, there's a weed California, Loki. Towns

36:21.280 --> 36:23.280
get names weird things all the time.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.760
But weed makes sense, though, because weeds are just out there, and that just happens

36:26.760 --> 36:27.760
to be slang.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.680
Chihuahua's not slang. It's a dog.

36:29.680 --> 36:34.240
Or Chihuahua's like, you know, they're an animal that runs around in parks like we have

36:34.240 --> 36:37.480
squirrels. And Mexico hates it because they don't bathe.

36:37.480 --> 36:38.480
Anyways.

36:38.480 --> 36:44.160
Wow. The views and opinions expressed. Act Deft says, and it's a state. Like, you know,

36:44.160 --> 36:46.640
how, well, it's not really a state, but, you know.

36:46.640 --> 36:52.400
Anyways, so Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior Fighter 2 has been blacklisted in Chihuahua, Mexico.

36:52.400 --> 36:58.120
And, you know, besides the fact that the city's got a weird name, there has been apparently

36:58.120 --> 37:03.080
orders. Mexico has apparently ordered the confiscation of any and all copies of Tom

37:03.080 --> 37:08.160
Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior 2 that surfaced in the state.

37:08.160 --> 37:11.160
This is a report from El Diario.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.360
El Diario.

37:13.360 --> 37:17.760
Is that also a town?

37:17.760 --> 37:18.760
I'm guessing they...

37:18.760 --> 37:19.760
After the water.

37:19.760 --> 37:25.720
It's not El Diario. I think it's El Diaro.

37:25.720 --> 37:33.960
A Mexican broadsheet, which says that the action was taken after Mayor Hector... I'm

37:33.960 --> 37:35.400
not even going to start pronouncing these names.

37:35.400 --> 37:42.960
I would fucking buy Ghost Recon if they had El Diario. It's like a terrorist in it.

37:42.960 --> 37:48.720
They've slammed the game as being a crime against the intellectual capacity of the Juarez

37:48.720 --> 37:56.640
residents. And apparently, they've decided to take action. So, in any case, Game Politics

37:56.640 --> 38:01.280
also notes that a statement they took from the mayor who said that violent video games

38:01.280 --> 38:06.280
instill values which are upside down, these actions are despicable because they attempt

38:06.280 --> 38:11.640
to divide the goodwill of the residents of America and Mexican cities.

38:11.640 --> 38:17.320
So, you won't be able to get your fix on Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior 2. However, God of

38:17.320 --> 38:22.760
War 2, I'm sure, is still selling like hotcakes.

38:22.760 --> 38:27.680
I'd like to give our apologies to ActDeaf and any other Mexican listeners we might have.

38:27.680 --> 38:32.760
Hope we didn't offend you too bad, but seriously, El Diario. That was funny.

38:32.760 --> 38:37.280
However, though, if you want to get in on some of that Ghost Recon Advanced Warrior

38:37.280 --> 38:41.560
2 action, it will be available on the PC. They're doing the beta test, which is starting

38:41.560 --> 38:51.840
in April. So, definitely go and sign up on the website, which is ghostrecon.uk.ubi.com.

38:51.840 --> 39:01.000
I guess this would be the UK beta test, now that I've noticed that.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.560
Anyways, so onto a different game. If you may not be able to play Ghost Recon Advanced

39:05.560 --> 39:11.640
Warrior 2, and you live in Mexico, maybe you want to participate in the beta for Quake

39:11.640 --> 39:16.480
Wars, because id Software is looking for some good first-person shooter clans to get in

39:16.480 --> 39:23.680
on this beta test. And basically, what you'll need to do is have your clans register for

39:23.680 --> 39:35.200
this, and basically you can participate by sending your application to etqwbetatestatactivision.com,

39:35.200 --> 39:40.640
and with it following your clan name, number of active members, games played regularly,

39:40.640 --> 39:44.320
and played competitively, your website, and details like that.

39:44.320 --> 39:51.000
100 OLR achievement points to the first person to make the El Diario clan.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.280
But Quake Wars looks awesome, can't wait to play it when it comes out on the 360. PlayStation

39:55.280 --> 39:59.040
3 and PC.

39:59.040 --> 40:03.800
Anyways, kind of off to a little bit of a different tangent here. Another first-person

40:03.800 --> 40:08.880
game that's definitely popular out there right now is Gears of War, and New Line apparently

40:08.880 --> 40:16.200
found time to register the rights for the movie, or secure the rights for the movie,

40:16.200 --> 40:20.880
so that they can make yet another horrible video game movie.

40:20.880 --> 40:21.880
Awesome.

40:21.880 --> 40:27.080
Anyways, Variety was reporting that New Line Cinemas has snagged the rights to Gears of

40:27.080 --> 40:35.160
War, and that Stuart Beattie will be writing the script with Marty Bowen and Wick Godfrey.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.160
It'll suck.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.760
Yeah, I can't say that I recognize any of those people.

40:38.760 --> 40:41.440
How can it be good? I'm sorry, it'll suck.

40:41.440 --> 40:47.920
The rights went up for auction with a 21-page treatment by Beattie, best known for his script

40:47.920 --> 40:51.960
work on Collateral and Derailed. Well, Collateral and Derailed are pretty good, so...

40:51.960 --> 40:52.960
The movie Derailed?

40:52.960 --> 40:53.960
Yeah.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.400
Oh, man, that was like the worst movie ever made. Derailed?

40:57.400 --> 40:58.400
Yeah.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.400
Yeah, with Jennifer Aniston?

41:00.400 --> 41:01.400
Oh!

41:01.400 --> 41:02.400
Yeah, I forgot to...

41:02.400 --> 41:03.400
Oh, yeah!

41:03.400 --> 41:04.400
Collateral's good, though. Collateral's good.

41:04.400 --> 41:09.960
I never saw Collateral, but Derailed was god-awful. I wanted to, like, gouge out my eyes and stuff

41:09.960 --> 41:10.960
afterwards.

41:10.960 --> 41:11.960
I have my hopes for this movie, though.

41:11.960 --> 41:12.960
Did it make you want to kill yourself, like Ultimate Duck Hunt?

41:12.960 --> 41:15.160
Yeah. I was like, oh, man.

41:15.160 --> 41:19.480
It could be pretty good. They could flesh out the somewhat-existent story and actually

41:19.480 --> 41:26.280
make something that's entertaining and kind of interesting, which video game movies usually

41:26.280 --> 41:29.760
lack. At least good entertaining, not, like, ha-ha entertaining.

41:29.760 --> 41:33.400
Because that idea worked so well with Resident Evil and Doom.

41:33.400 --> 41:39.720
Resident Evil is decent. Not this new one that has that horror from Heroes on it, but...

41:39.720 --> 41:40.720
The movies, you mean?

41:40.720 --> 41:41.720
Yeah.

41:41.720 --> 41:42.720
Oh, they're all great.

41:42.720 --> 41:45.360
Funny you should mention Resident Evil, because...

41:45.360 --> 41:46.360
Segways!

41:46.360 --> 41:52.560
I love Segways, because Capcom is having their Capcom Day, which I might add we weren't invited

41:52.560 --> 41:53.760
to. Thank you very much.

41:53.760 --> 41:54.760
What was it?

41:54.760 --> 41:55.760
Capcom!

41:55.760 --> 41:56.760
April 12th.

41:56.760 --> 42:00.240
Why you got against Orange Loud Radio? Afraid we're going to say something we should?

42:00.240 --> 42:01.880
What the hell was that?

42:01.880 --> 42:02.880
My pouty voice.

42:02.880 --> 42:03.880
Oh, my.

42:03.880 --> 42:04.880
No love from Capcom.

42:04.880 --> 42:05.880
Okay.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.880
No love from Capcom.

42:07.880 --> 42:11.360
Maybe I was a little hard on Dead Rising, but anyways.

42:11.360 --> 42:16.960
Another Capcom Day is going to be April 12th. One game has been announced already, and that

42:16.960 --> 42:24.220
would be the Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii, and that's one thing that they're

42:24.220 --> 42:28.840
hoping that will be featured there, as well as some info on Resident Evil 5 for the PlayStation

42:28.840 --> 42:31.240
3 and 360.

42:31.240 --> 42:36.600
Another thing, though, is they're going to be announcing a brand new game, and so we

42:36.600 --> 42:39.480
don't know what exactly that is. Just a brand new game.

42:39.480 --> 42:43.160
Evil Joe again, or maybe Mega Man. That would be nice.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.440
Megalotov is adamant about a Phoenix Wright 3.

42:45.440 --> 42:48.920
I hope not.

42:48.920 --> 42:52.840
That's only the best game they've ever had in, like, ten years.

42:52.840 --> 42:53.840
Ever.

42:53.840 --> 42:57.240
Ever in ten years.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.680
What about a new Mega Man game? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?

42:59.680 --> 43:00.680
Well, there's...

43:00.680 --> 43:03.560
Well, how about taking Mega Man back to its roots?

43:03.560 --> 43:04.560
Taking it back.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.560
Taking it back. Back to its roots.

43:05.560 --> 43:08.720
That would be great if they did that, because I don't know what's up with all the...

43:08.720 --> 43:09.720
Mega Man Z.

43:09.720 --> 43:10.720
The whole new franchise.

43:10.720 --> 43:11.720
Battle Network, whatever, crap.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.720
They already did Mega Man Z, and it sucked.

43:13.720 --> 43:14.720
Oh.

43:14.720 --> 43:15.720
Mega Man 9.

43:15.720 --> 43:16.720
Crap.

43:16.720 --> 43:17.720
Just Mega Man 9? I'd go for that.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.840
Mega Man ZX. It was horrible.

43:19.840 --> 43:23.520
How about just Mega Man? You know, I think folks will forgive you if you just want to

43:23.520 --> 43:24.520
start over with his name.

43:24.520 --> 43:29.640
How about just redo Mega Man Legends? Legends was pretty fun. Legends 3. Seriously, bring

43:29.640 --> 43:30.640
Tron Bon back.

43:30.640 --> 43:31.640
Alright, I'm done.

43:31.640 --> 43:32.640
Alright, anyways.

43:32.640 --> 43:40.440
Finally, this kind of... got to bring it full circle back to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

43:40.440 --> 43:45.960
Move over, King Kong! There's a new leader of ultimate easy achievement points, and that

43:45.960 --> 43:52.080
is TMNT the game. Apparently, you can get all 1000 achievement points within 4 hours.

43:52.080 --> 43:53.080
It is that easy.

43:53.080 --> 43:54.080
Dang.

43:54.080 --> 44:00.920
So, the game itself, though, hasn't been getting that very good reviews, but hey, it's worth

44:00.920 --> 44:03.760
a rental for an easy 1000 achievement points.

44:03.760 --> 44:08.000
What do you do in it? Did they say what the achievement points are?

44:08.000 --> 44:13.680
They haven't said, but basically, the quote, Team Xbox. If there's one good thing about

44:13.680 --> 44:18.080
TMNT, it's the fact that the game steals the title for easiest 1000 achievement points

44:18.080 --> 44:24.040
from Ubisoft's own King Kong. You'll probably be able to get all 1000 in less than 4 hours.

44:24.040 --> 44:29.200
Let's see what else here. GameSpot says there's also achievements to consider, but they also

44:29.200 --> 44:34.800
happen to be incredibly easy to acquire, with many of them regulated to points for beating

44:34.800 --> 44:40.280
levels and pulling off individual special abilities. Even still, the better graphics

44:40.280 --> 44:45.400
and achievements ultimately make the 360 version the best by default.

44:45.400 --> 44:50.960
Hmm. Interesting. I might check it out. It seems like something that would be like a

44:50.960 --> 44:54.960
rental, but I don't know if I'd buy that, especially just for 1000 achievement points.

44:54.960 --> 45:00.360
I don't care. The Tetris game I bought today seems to have okay achievement points. It's

45:00.360 --> 45:03.560
doable if you are any good at Tetris.

45:03.560 --> 45:08.800
I'm telling you. Earth Defense Force 2017. It's the dumbest game on the face of the earth,

45:08.800 --> 45:10.320
but so fun to play.

45:10.320 --> 45:12.120
But is it easy to use?

45:12.120 --> 45:16.200
Not easy achievement points at all. Although, actually, no. Probably beating a game on easy

45:16.200 --> 45:21.680
and normal would be relatively easy, although normal is pretty hard. But that's what's the

45:21.680 --> 45:22.680
good thing about it.

45:22.680 --> 45:26.000
It's open, by the way. A username, OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype. 1-877-GAME-OLR.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.080
That's kind of the good thing about it, though, is because it is so hard, it will take you

45:31.080 --> 45:36.600
a while to beat the game. Yes, it does get frustrating, but you can strategize and replay

45:36.600 --> 45:42.960
certain levels to get your hit points up as you keep playing them. Plus, you unlock different

45:42.960 --> 45:47.160
weapons that might help out with playing through the levels at a harder difficulty or something

45:47.160 --> 45:51.320
like that. There's a lot of strategy involved there. Plus, it's just so cheesy and stupid

45:51.320 --> 45:57.960
that you gotta play it. I mean, your other guys will yell weird shit like, oh no! Tiny

45:57.960 --> 46:00.520
died! Oh no! Big stuff died!

46:00.520 --> 46:04.600
I don't know. I just want to keep playing Castlevania Symphony of the Night right now,

46:04.600 --> 46:07.320
to be honest. All over again. Like, it was the first time.

46:07.320 --> 46:08.320
Heck yeah.

46:08.320 --> 46:13.040
We got a call on the old Skype line. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

46:13.040 --> 46:14.040
This is DMN.

46:14.040 --> 46:17.440
Hello, DMN! Long time, no talk. What's on your mind?

46:17.440 --> 46:19.720
This is CNN.

46:19.720 --> 46:24.480
No, it's not. Don't get us sued. This is OLR. What's on your mind, DMN?

46:24.480 --> 46:29.880
Well, I came across your website a couple days ago, and I noticed the Katamari story

46:29.880 --> 46:31.640
got removed.

46:31.640 --> 46:38.880
Interesting you should bring that up. What do you want to say about it?

46:38.880 --> 46:44.880
Fuck GameSpot and everything it stands for regarding that. Didn't they pull the story

46:44.880 --> 46:50.560
up only a few days after, and not even cite OrangeLoungeRadio for it?

46:50.560 --> 46:54.860
I can't comment on this at this time. Next week we'll have an official statement on what's

46:54.860 --> 46:57.920
going on, but we can't comment on what's going on at this time.

46:57.920 --> 46:58.920
Wow.

46:58.920 --> 47:00.960
So, that's it.

47:00.960 --> 47:01.960
Okay.

47:01.960 --> 47:05.120
Anything else you want to ask us about? Thanks for bringing that up.

47:05.120 --> 47:12.120
What'd you say, Mikal Tom?

47:12.120 --> 47:16.600
I was going to ask him about how much he hates the stupid people in WoW, because he was complaining

47:16.600 --> 47:17.600
about it earlier.

47:17.600 --> 47:22.080
Oh yeah, you're in our WoW guild. What's going on in WoW?

47:22.080 --> 47:26.280
I'm just getting sick of all the stupid people who think that Internet shorthand is okay

47:26.280 --> 47:30.440
in that fucking game. Like, it's acceptable to a degree.

47:30.440 --> 47:35.600
Like, OOL and stuff like that?

47:35.600 --> 47:43.880
Okay. For example, don't use the letter U to represent you. It's two extra fucking letters

47:43.880 --> 47:48.400
you can type. Y-O-U. Jesus Christ.

47:48.400 --> 47:52.280
Isn't there some type of add-on that you can get for World of Warcraft that will allow

47:52.280 --> 47:56.520
you to automatically... I remember DrewNami was telling me about this once when he was

47:56.520 --> 48:00.280
here. It was something about, I don't know, some filter that would automatically change

48:00.280 --> 48:03.680
the letter U into Y-O-U and it would change a lot of the noob speak for you.

48:03.680 --> 48:06.240
God, I need to find that.

48:06.240 --> 48:09.520
DrewNami's chat, he says it's called Eloquence, is what it's called.

48:09.520 --> 48:15.000
I'll have to pick that up, because I don't mind typing out full words in full sentences,

48:15.000 --> 48:16.760
but I guess I'm the only person.

48:16.760 --> 48:21.480
That's why you should just stay with your guild, because we all type normally.

48:21.480 --> 48:23.320
I love my guild. My guild's awesome.

48:23.320 --> 48:24.600
We are awesome.

48:24.600 --> 48:29.600
And go vote for the songs for the STFU song tournament. We're at the Sweet 16. The big

48:29.600 --> 48:31.600
match-up right now is Colors vs So Deep.

48:31.600 --> 48:34.640
Go So Deep.

48:34.640 --> 48:39.160
Alright, you guys should vote. Ready, set, Rob's going to hang up on me.

48:39.160 --> 48:43.520
No, I'm not, but thank you very much for striking the nerve and allowing me to tease next week.

48:43.520 --> 48:46.600
No problem. Have a good weekend.

48:46.600 --> 48:47.600
Alright, you too.

48:47.600 --> 48:48.600
Alright, bye.

48:48.600 --> 48:49.600
Bye.

48:49.600 --> 48:50.600
Bye, DMN.

48:50.600 --> 48:56.840
If you want to call us, 1-877-GAME-OLR is the phone number, or you can call us, username

48:56.840 --> 49:03.000
is OrangeLoungeRadio on Skype. I swear we didn't pay him to call in and ask about that.

49:03.000 --> 49:10.080
Funny you should mention that. Loki and I were just talking about that before the show.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.080
Let's go to another call.

49:11.080 --> 49:14.080
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

49:14.080 --> 49:16.520
It's Legend of Zaku.

49:16.520 --> 49:18.640
Hi, Legend of Zaku. What's on your mind?

49:18.640 --> 49:26.360
Nah, just chilling. Nothing much, but I'm off the heels of a shitty tournament that

49:26.360 --> 49:30.640
I went to yesterday, then getting filmed for a DDR documentary.

49:30.640 --> 49:35.040
You went to a DDR tournament yesterday that was shitty. What tournament was this?

49:35.040 --> 49:41.280
This was one out in Long Island, far from where I live, but me and three other players

49:41.280 --> 49:42.640
from the city just went out there.

49:42.640 --> 49:45.840
Don't they have pretty good transit, though? Because you can take transit out to the whole

49:45.840 --> 49:46.840
city.

49:46.840 --> 49:47.840
Of course, we took the railroad.

49:47.840 --> 49:51.640
There you go. You guys have much better out there when it comes to transit than we do.

49:51.640 --> 49:54.680
It's kind of harder out here.

49:54.680 --> 50:00.720
The place we went to was really accessible. The only good thing about it was the documentary

50:00.720 --> 50:05.040
that two NYU students were filming on DDR players.

50:05.040 --> 50:09.000
What's the documentary? I have to be honest, though. A DDR documentary does not strike

50:09.000 --> 50:15.760
me as anything new. What makes this one special?

50:15.760 --> 50:25.680
One day, this NYU film student was just filming the four of us through the tournament and

50:25.680 --> 50:32.320
just through our normal routines, just doing all the stupid things that we do. In addition,

50:32.320 --> 50:38.200
we were actually interviewed. We were asked questions about the basic stuff about how

50:38.200 --> 50:41.200
long we've been playing DDR. We got into it.

50:41.200 --> 50:47.960
Then we have other questions such as how do you see yourself in the scene years from now?

50:47.960 --> 50:51.360
That sort of thing. It's kind of like a future perspective.

50:51.360 --> 50:56.000
I was once interviewed for one of these documentaries. I believe it was right when we started Orange

50:56.000 --> 50:58.640
Lounge. It was about a year after we started. I don't think these people knew about the

50:58.640 --> 50:59.640
radio stations.

50:59.640 --> 51:03.960
I used to do freestyling under a pseudonym, Dr. Dick. I just would get up on the machine

51:03.960 --> 51:07.800
and do an improv and just fuck off. I'd wear a funny hat. They wanted to interview me for

51:07.800 --> 51:12.000
this documentary. They wanted me to wear the funny hat. I said no because I knew they would

51:12.000 --> 51:18.040
edit me to look like an idiot. I didn't want that.

51:18.040 --> 51:25.880
The documentary right now is still ongoing. She plans on filming more tournaments in the

51:25.880 --> 51:34.080
next few weeks, especially some major ones, some in the group two tournaments with R21.

51:34.080 --> 51:38.280
It's only the tip of the iceberg right now since she has plenty of time to work on it.

51:38.280 --> 51:46.680
It's going to be a little bit more in depth than just a one-time thing.

51:46.680 --> 51:51.120
I'm sorry to hear the tournament was not all that fun. What do you think a future tournament

51:51.120 --> 51:54.640
organizer should consider in planning a DDR tournament?

51:54.640 --> 52:00.400
Fix the pads. It needs better pads, period. That's the only thing that just killed it

52:00.400 --> 52:08.400
right there. The pads were pretty horrible. For certain players, they got lucky because

52:08.400 --> 52:13.480
they were managing to get by, but they were getting a lot of pad misses. It just didn't

52:13.480 --> 52:14.480
feel right.

52:14.480 --> 52:17.640
Make sure your damn machine is working before you have a tournament. Fair enough?

52:17.640 --> 52:18.640
All right.

52:18.640 --> 52:20.960
Thank you, Zaku. We appreciate the call.

52:20.960 --> 52:21.960
All right.

52:21.960 --> 52:22.960
Later.

52:22.960 --> 52:23.960
Bye.

52:23.960 --> 52:24.960
Bye.

52:24.960 --> 52:30.880
Going to chat room and looking at comments while we wait for more phone calls. 1-877

52:30.880 --> 52:37.600
Game OLR. DDR dollar bill says, Dr. Dick, that was you? Yeah. I didn't think there was

52:37.600 --> 52:40.680
anything on YouTube. There was some freestyle video floating around for a little while.

52:40.680 --> 52:44.880
I was just dancing like an idiot. It was nothing serious. It was just silly.

52:44.880 --> 52:49.080
Let's see. Black boy, I guess I'm going to say this. Black boy in chat says, so wait,

52:49.080 --> 52:54.200
IGN or GameSpot ripped off OLR's news and didn't credit them. No, that's not what's

52:54.200 --> 53:01.020
going on. Again, we can't say too much yet because we're kind of waiting to make an official

53:01.020 --> 53:06.940
thing, but we're not claiming that at all. What we will say is that it is interesting

53:06.940 --> 53:11.760
that other sites are reporting the exact same thing that we did and other sites are continuing

53:11.760 --> 53:15.240
to run that information. I suppose that's all we can say at this time. Correct?

53:15.240 --> 53:16.240
Correct.

53:16.240 --> 53:22.960
All right. Let's go to another call, that being said. Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

53:22.960 --> 53:23.960
Who's this?

53:23.960 --> 53:24.960
Hey, what's up guys? It's Toshin.

53:24.960 --> 53:25.960
Hi, Toshin. What's on your mind?

53:25.960 --> 53:33.440
I don't want to bring this all to a wow tangent, but I got to ask something. In the last couple

53:33.440 --> 53:35.800
weeks, you said you've been playing well a lot, right?

53:35.800 --> 53:36.800
Yep.

53:36.800 --> 53:40.160
How long have you been playing well?

53:40.160 --> 53:44.680
Like how many hours a week do I put in the game or how long have I been?

53:44.680 --> 53:45.680
Overall.

53:45.680 --> 53:50.240
Overall? This recent round, I just started playing right when Burning Crusade came out

53:50.240 --> 53:55.960
about a week after, so January this year. I've played on and off since, oh hell, I don't

53:55.960 --> 54:03.180
even remember when I made the first character, probably about a year ago, I want to say.

54:03.180 --> 54:08.760
Is it a hard game to get into? I must be the only one that I know, speaking for myself,

54:08.760 --> 54:12.160
that has never played a multi RPG or anything like that.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.240
Migotov wants to chime in.

54:13.240 --> 54:17.880
Have you started playing it yet or are you just thinking about it?

54:17.880 --> 54:23.320
My friends, and I know a lot of people, including Rob, who have played it a lot somewhat, and

54:23.320 --> 54:28.360
I find it interesting stuff, but I've just never come to bring myself to invest the time

54:28.360 --> 54:32.520
in it. Is it a hard thing to get into?

54:32.520 --> 54:38.560
It really depends on what class you play, what server you're playing on. If you're playing

54:38.560 --> 54:39.560
with friends or not.

54:39.560 --> 54:42.720
I think, yeah, because the social element of the game is huge.

54:42.720 --> 54:47.360
If you were to join our guild, you'd probably have a good time as long as you picked a decent

54:47.360 --> 54:51.320
class to play around with. Something that's not so hard, something you can just pick up

54:51.320 --> 54:55.720
and be like, oh, I can do this on my own without too much problem.

54:55.720 --> 54:58.340
It definitely feels rewarding sometimes playing in it. It's pretty fun.

54:58.340 --> 55:02.920
I think the nice thing about WoW is that Blizzard has it set up really easy for you to take

55:02.920 --> 55:08.560
your first hit, basically. You can download essentially the whole damn thing and get easily

55:08.560 --> 55:13.080
a 10-day free trial from somebody. I'm sure Migotov, myself, or any of us would be willing

55:13.080 --> 55:14.080
to hook you up with a 10-day trial.

55:14.080 --> 55:18.960
You can download it on WoW's site now, because you don't even have to know somebody that

55:18.960 --> 55:20.560
has the game. You can just download it free time.

55:20.560 --> 55:25.240
That's cool. It's very easy to set up and run with now, to at least try it out and see

55:25.240 --> 55:29.160
if it's something for you. If you've never played an MMO before, it might be a little

55:29.160 --> 55:30.160
weird.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.160
Yeah, it'd be a total noob.

55:31.160 --> 55:34.160
So you're a total noob. Well, that's cool, because you've called into this show enough

55:34.160 --> 55:38.120
before, and you've been in chat long enough so that I know you're not a dumbass, and you

55:38.120 --> 55:42.800
speak intelligently when you type and everything. You don't use the letter U for U and all that.

55:42.800 --> 55:48.520
So I don't think you're going to really have a problem fitting in, so to speak, into WoW.

55:48.520 --> 55:52.480
But have you ever played Diablo, or a game like it?

55:52.480 --> 55:57.600
I've fiddled with it. My friend's like, here, take my map and run over to this spot on the

55:57.600 --> 56:01.160
map. I'm like, what do I do if I run into something? Click the mouse button or something

56:01.160 --> 56:02.160
like that.

56:02.160 --> 56:05.720
Part of getting into WoW, don't be afraid to die. Everybody dies the first couple of

56:05.720 --> 56:09.160
times they play. The game is not set up so that your character will get deleted forever

56:09.160 --> 56:10.160
if you die a few times.

56:10.160 --> 56:13.800
Dying is kind of cool because it changes the way the game looks until you get to your body,

56:13.800 --> 56:15.600
so die a lot.

56:15.600 --> 56:20.920
I honestly found WoW a lot easier to get into than Final Fantasy XI. I'm not trying to knock

56:20.920 --> 56:24.640
Final Fantasy XI. I played it for a long time, and I have some good memories from that game,

56:24.640 --> 56:29.680
but it was a lot harder to figure out the first time than WoW was. WoW was set up pretty

56:29.680 --> 56:31.440
easy to just kind of jump into and go.

56:31.440 --> 56:35.720
Well, I have a question for you guys. Did you guys ever read the manual?

56:35.720 --> 56:36.720
No.

56:36.720 --> 56:37.720
No.

56:37.720 --> 56:38.720
Yeah.

56:38.720 --> 56:40.440
I've never read manuals to games.

56:40.440 --> 56:41.440
Really?

56:41.440 --> 56:42.440
Yeah, nor do I.

56:42.440 --> 56:45.280
Actually, I'll tell you that I cracked open Final Fantasy XI's manual because I got so

56:45.280 --> 56:48.560
frustrated I didn't know how to do something. I finally had to look it up how to do it.

56:48.560 --> 56:52.960
I think I did too, but that was during the 13-hour install of the game. I was just like,

56:52.960 --> 56:53.960
I need something to do.

56:53.960 --> 56:58.800
Yeah. See, I think if you're brand new to MMOs, it wouldn't hurt to go through the manual

56:58.800 --> 57:05.000
and see some of the advice it gives and how to do certain things because my first MMO

57:05.000 --> 57:07.800
was Guild Wars, and I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

57:07.800 --> 57:08.800
Guild Wars was confusing.

57:08.800 --> 57:15.000
It was confusing. When I started playing WoW, I thought I knew what I was doing, but I kind

57:15.000 --> 57:20.000
of didn't. I looked in the manual, and it helped me a lot, so that would be my advice.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.240
Joshin, I guess I end with this. What do you got to lose?

57:23.240 --> 57:24.240
Money?

57:24.240 --> 57:28.440
Your life, actually. Your real life, you have to lose.

57:28.440 --> 57:31.720
You can at least get the free trial to start it off, you know?

57:31.720 --> 57:33.280
Join Ravencrest, and we'll help you out.

57:33.280 --> 57:36.280
Yeah, Ravencrest Horde side, and you can play with us, and we're cool.

57:36.280 --> 57:37.280
How long's the trial?

57:37.280 --> 57:38.280
Ten days.

57:38.280 --> 57:39.280
Ten days?

57:39.280 --> 57:42.120
Enough for you to take your first hit and decide if it's something you want to continue,

57:42.120 --> 57:45.760
and then you can go from there. I know it's, what, 1295, 1495 months?

57:45.760 --> 57:47.760
1495, but you get limited character.

57:47.760 --> 57:50.240
How much Canadian? Toshin's in Canada, so...

57:50.240 --> 57:51.240
I don't know.

57:51.240 --> 57:52.240
Who cares?

57:52.240 --> 57:53.240
A little more.

57:53.240 --> 57:54.240
There you go. Who cares?

57:54.240 --> 57:55.760
Who cares, eh? Who cares, eh?

57:55.760 --> 57:56.760
All right.

57:56.760 --> 57:57.760
All right.

57:57.760 --> 58:00.160
Well, Toshin, we hope to see you online, but if not, you know...

58:00.160 --> 58:02.440
I'm in the chat room. You know where to find me.

58:02.440 --> 58:07.200
All right, we do. Any other thoughts or comments tonight?

58:07.200 --> 58:11.520
Not really. I'd like to just say, Travis, thanks for letting me win the game yesterday.

58:11.520 --> 58:15.480
There you have it. Travis Donovan live on Saturday nights. If you want to know what

58:15.480 --> 58:18.760
the hell Toshin's talking about, you've got to download Saturday's archive, correct?

58:18.760 --> 58:19.760
That's correct.

58:19.760 --> 58:20.760
There you go.

58:20.760 --> 58:21.760
Not pimping or anything. I'm here for Olara only.

58:21.760 --> 58:25.680
That's fine. That's fine. Travis has an OLR program. We love having him on board.

58:25.680 --> 58:26.680
Okay.

58:26.680 --> 58:27.680
All right. Take care, buddy.

58:27.680 --> 58:28.680
See you later.

58:28.680 --> 58:29.680
See you.

58:29.680 --> 58:44.720
All right, well, we'll see you in the next one.

58:44.720 --> 58:45.720
Bye.

58:45.720 --> 58:46.720
Bye.

58:46.720 --> 58:47.720
Bye.

58:47.720 --> 58:48.720
Bye.

58:48.720 --> 58:59.720
You were in chat saying WoW can be played casually. And WoW has that rest bar feature.

58:59.720 --> 59:05.600
That's what I liked about WoW is that it has the rest bar so that the addicts get a little

59:05.600 --> 59:09.800
bit of a handicap, shall we say, amongst the folks who only can log in occasionally. And

59:09.800 --> 59:13.860
that's what's kept me afloat sometimes in that game because I just went four days without

59:13.860 --> 59:16.480
signing in. I probably have so much rest bar. It's crazy.

59:16.480 --> 59:20.640
It also just depends on the MMO you pick if you really feel like you need to dedicate

59:20.640 --> 59:25.720
a lot of time to it. I played Final Fantasy XI casually and that's not a casual game whatsoever.

59:25.720 --> 59:27.680
One more call then, shall we? Let's do another call.

59:27.680 --> 59:28.680
Yes.

59:28.680 --> 59:33.420
Well, hi. Yes. Damn it. Hi. You're on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?

59:33.420 --> 59:35.760
One more thing, Ravenstaufen.

59:35.760 --> 59:38.660
I like how you've incorporated that into your name. What's on your mind, One More Thing,

59:38.660 --> 59:41.080
Ravenstaufen?

59:41.080 --> 59:44.880
The Sony PlayStation launch in Europe. That's been on my mind for a while.

59:44.880 --> 59:47.920
And how so? Why has that been on your mind?

59:47.920 --> 59:51.120
We got shot.

59:51.120 --> 59:52.120
We got shot?

59:52.120 --> 59:55.640
We as a collective people got shot.

59:55.640 --> 59:59.600
Did you get shot looking for your PlayStation 3?

59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.960
Oh no. I stood in my bunker. I was in my room.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.200
There you go. Well, what do you mean? So you're saying you're surprised because we were all

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.960
getting shot over it and what's that?

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:14.860
And Sony gave out TVs for the Europeans and I thought that was nice. But they didn't

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.440
do it for us.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:20.000
Don't you think Sony kind of owed Europe something though? Like, sorry you had to wait

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
six months.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.820
Oh, most definitely.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:29.360
So what's interesting is that the first hundred folks got a TV but the second hundred folks

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.960
got flak jackets in case they got shot. So Sony is very nice over there in Europe.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.960
That's a one also on the jokes there.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.960
That's a W.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.400
That's what I get for improvising here on the program.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:46.160
What else is on your mind concerning this whole PlayStation 3 stuff Raven's Dolphin?

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.120
Two more things, Sky.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:56.720
How is that capability testing going at the Sony Corporation?

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:05.560
I still stick to what I said when that whole joke came up in the first place on All Games

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.780
Interactive. If you're buying a PlayStation 3 to play PlayStation 2 games, you are buying

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:13.520
a PlayStation 3 for the wrong reasons.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.160
Okay, I got a joke for you.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.800
Goodie, I can't wait for this. All right, what is that?

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.600
All right, a man walked into a doctor's office wearing ceram wrap.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600
What?

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.600
What did the doctor say?

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.640
Let him finish. Sorry Raven's Dolphin, what?

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:36.920
A man walked into a doctor's office and he dressed in ceram wrap. What did the doctor

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.400
say?

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.280
Why the fuck are you sitting in my office dressed in fucking ceram wrap, you fucking

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.280
freak?

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:46.280
No, I see you're nuts.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.280
One.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.280
One.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:56.420
I'd be a little nicer. I'd give it a three, Raven's Dolphin.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:57.420
A for effort.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:02.480
What's with the balls jokes? First it was Bill Cosby and now it's just some random guy.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.640
They got the memo, you like balls.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.640
All right.

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.640
Okay.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.640
All right, Raven's Dolphin, thanks for the call, but on that note-

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.640
Visit secondgames.com.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.640
All right, bye.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:18.280
Good times, it's paid.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:20.880
I think that's a good way to end the calls for tonight. What do you think?

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.880
Sure, why not?

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.920
I see you're nuts, Riz Princess. You're fucking nuts.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.920
That's awkward.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.920
Fucking butts.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:35.360
Is that it for the show? Are there any other last minute stories you came across, Loki?

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.120
I have one, it's big. I have a big last minute story for you guys.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:40.120
Let's go.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:45.160
A little birdie has told me, and this is a rumor, but a little birdie told me that Paper

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:51.520
Mario may be on its way to Virtual Console sooner than you think. Super Paper Mario's

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:59.000
release may coincide with that. Stop booing Paper Mario, Miklotov, it's a fine game. So

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.880
there you have it. Don't count that game out just yet.

01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.120
Wasn't that a GameCube title or is that a 64 title?

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:09.520
It was originally Nintendo 64, but I believe there was the thousand year door or whatever

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.600
was on GameCube. The original was Nintendo 64.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600
Oh, cool.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.440
Oh, I just got a good news story right here.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.440
What's that?

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.800
In actual news though, here's another rumor for you.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.800
Don't laugh, it encourages her.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:33.720
And this is going to be even more confusing, but apparently according to NGC magazine in

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:42.360
the UK, an article in there said, there's no screenshots of it yet, but the UK version

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:49.340
of Pokemon Battle Revolution will not have the restrictions of the friend code system.

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:50.340
Really?

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:51.340
So that's confusing.

01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:56.920
So in other words, Europe might not have to, because they don't have child molesters in

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.280
Europe I guess, they're not going to have to worry about friend codes maybe.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.440
Hear that or maybe they're just, I don't know, a little laid back.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.720
Everybody needs to look Reggie Fils-Aime in the eye and go, friend codes, yes or no, I

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.360
want a clear answer, don't BS me.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:14.560
What they should do is say, I will arm wrestle you, Reggie, and the winner decides a friend

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.560
code thing. That's how it should be done.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.800
But Reggie would win every time.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:23.920
You just got to get someone stronger. We need to get Chuck Norris. That's what we need to

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.920
do.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:34.040
Anyways, um, what else? Let's see here, 3Speech, which I remember from-

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.360
The chatter sent me a story I need to read, but go ahead and do yours first.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:43.960
3Speech is saying that there's more download content on the way, and I think if I remember

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.000
correctly that's the semi-official Sony blog.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:57.240
Anyways, Genji Dazeblade says more excitement will be coming, including new armor, I guess.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:02.920
Oh, and yeah, new armor for your four playable characters.

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.920
Don't care.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.920
Don't care.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:10.920
Ridge Racer 7, I'm supposed to be getting some more decal packs.

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.760
So I guess that's neat.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:17.760
MotorStorm, it says any PS3 player playing MotorStorm online will receive time trial

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.760
mode automatically.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.760
That actually, I think, was launched this week, so I know that's going into effect.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.700
There's supposed to be some new friend codes, er, not friend codes, system, like a friends

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.760
list system for that as well.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:34.920
And Resistance Fallen Man, two new playable maps, Western Moreland and Kambor, those are

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.380
coming soon as well. I think those are coming in April.

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:41.600
One of our users, Meklar, wanted me to share this with you. He sent me this in chat. It's

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.960
a story from Kotaku. Somebody named John, I guess, who's a reader of the site, just

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.960
got home from the launch at the Virgin Mega Store in London.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.520
Apparently, they were all given some chairs. There were some friendly folks on hand giving

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.960
out some camping chairs.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:06:02.120
And on the back of the chairs, it said, shouldn't have kept you waiting. And it was www.shkyw.org.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:09.320
And if you visit the URL, Xbox welcomes PlayStation 3 to the next generation.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:15.520
Sony, you're late. Let the games begin.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.440
And it looks to be just a big Microsoft ad here. There might be sound with this. I'm

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.440
visiting.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:23.800
Oh, it's just a little flash animation that goes, Xbox welcomes PlayStation 3 to the next

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:24.800
generation.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.840
Who knows if that was an official Microsoft sanctioned thing, but that's pretty funny

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:28.840
either way.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.760
They had barges and stuff there during the France launch as well.

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.760
Really?

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.760
Yeah.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.760
Cute.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.760
Apparently, there is a...

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.760
That's cute, Microsoft.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:45.320
A 2D version of Ocarina of Time being made by some guy, looks like named Richard. And

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:49.720
he's dead now from a car crash. So no 2D Ocarina of Time for you.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:54.320
I'm so glad Loki doesn't report the real news because he would have no sensitivity whatsoever.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:07:01.200
In better news though, Matrix is coming to HD DVD and Blu-ray and that's awesome.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.960
Can I say I'm sorry to hear about the guy behind the project? That's too bad.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.480
Ocarina of Time was overrated anyways. Why would you want to make a 2D version of that

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.480
anyway?

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.800
I am so distancing myself from Loki's comments. Now is not the time to bring up that issue,

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.040
Loki. Now is not the time.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:23.760
Because it's an incorrect statement. It's not overrated. It's overgood.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.760
Overgood.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.760
Yeah.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.760
More gooder.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:27.760
Overgooder.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.440
More gooder. This for the person who is teasing me over the whole vehicular or whatever the

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.440
fuck I said earlier.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:39.640
Alright. Alright. Can we please end the damn show now?

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.640
What was it? Visceral?

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.640
Visceral. Whatever it was.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:46.280
Oh man, I have a funny laugh.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:50.720
I'm glad you're here to make the occasional fart joke and then tease me about mispronouncing

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.880
words. What the fuck else did you contribute to tonight's show?

01:07:53.880 --> 01:08:00.480
Awesomeness? I don't know. At least I think so.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:08.000
Alright. Let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Rice Princess, we'll start

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
with you.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.560
I just want to say thanks to everyone who added me as friends on the All Games Radio

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.560
community.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.560
Yep.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.920
Miklotov, do you have a final thought?

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:19.440
Why are you staring at me?

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:20.440
Nope.

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:25.760
Loki, do you have a final thought?

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:33.520
Well, I'm looking forward to playing more Earth Defense Force 2017. I guess I have to

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:39.680
wait until Super Paper Mario comes out before I get to play something new. Or do I?

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.720
The hell is that supposed to mean, you smug little bastard?

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.720
I think you know what it means.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:50.120
Alright. Alright. Maybe. Alright. And my final thought. Thank you very much for listening

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:54.560

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:08.240
Princess's fart noises can spread throughout the world. It's a great thing. There you go.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:12.040
With her mouth, folks, not her butt. That's gross. Have a great week. We'll see you next

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.960
