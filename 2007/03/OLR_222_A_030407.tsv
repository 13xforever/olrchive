7000	12000	There's a host, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco
13000	19000	Tonight, March 4th, 2007, drama ensues over Sony's rumored PlayStation Home.
19000	22000	We talk about who is starting an anti-weed campaign.
22000	26000	The popular new computer game is rumored to be making a jump to Xbox Live.
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello, everybody out there on the internet, on their iPods, their Zens, whatever devices you're using to listen to us.
38000	43000	Maybe your Xbox 360, thanks to the 360 cast or whatever that thing was called.
43000	45000	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
45000	49000	We are a show dedicated to video games and gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle.
49000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Yo.
55000	57000	How you doing, Miss Jamie Summers?
58000	59000	Ow.
59000	61000	Ow? What's wrong? Your head hurt?
61000	62000	No.
62000	63000	What?
63000	64000	Female ow.
64000	67000	Oh, I see. The TMI type of ow, huh?
67000	68000	Yes.
68000	71000	Sorry to hear it. Well, I'm sure we'll have some extra special eff you use tonight.
71000	72000	Yes.
72000	76000	But overall, a good weekend. Jamie and I had a play day yesterday in San Francisco. That was fun.
76000	80000	It was pretty fun. And we both have really hot hair now.
80000	84000	Yes, we got our hair done. That's the first time I've ever paid $45 for a haircut.
84000	85000	But it looks nice.
85000	89000	Be glad. You know how much I pay for mine.
89000	91000	Isn't that a sexist thing?
91000	94000	I have more hair, and I have more shit done to my hair.
94000	96000	What if I was a dude with long hair?
96000	97000	They'd probably charge you more.
97000	98000	You think?
98000	102000	Not that I would ever have long hair, but I've seen guys with longer hair than a lot of women I know.
102000	105000	Well, like Marissa's boyfriend.
105000	106000	Oh, that's true. Yeah.
106000	110000	He's got gorgeous, gorgeous supermodel hair.
110000	114000	If I remember right, I think he chopped it off at one point.
114000	118000	But remember Blue from DER Freak, who's really into pump it up? Didn't he have kind of long hair?
118000	120000	He almost had it in a ponytail, didn't he?
120000	122000	Yeah, he had really, really long hair.
122000	124000	Yes, that's who I kind of think of. I remember him.
124000	126000	Anyway, say hello as well.
126000	132000	Before we talk about people who aren't here to defend themselves too much, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.
132000	134000	Yes, I'm here.
134000	135000	How you doing, Loki?
135000	136000	I'm doing good.
136000	137000	Great.
137000	142000	I see you have not one, but two PSPs up and running with Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.
142000	145000	Are you playing against yourself tonight? What is going on here?
145000	147000	Yeah, I was just testing stuff.
147000	149000	He's playing with himself on my radio.
149000	152000	Fun. What types of things are you testing out?
152000	161000	Just Dark Alex's custom firmware, because it allowed me to run PS1 games on it.
161000	164000	Wow, that's like three weeks in a row, four weeks in a row?
164000	169000	I think that that's fantastic, because right when you made that little announcement, we have the doom and gloom music stuff.
169000	170000	No, actually that reminds me...
170000	173000	I should just do that every week, because I never forget to...
173000	180000	Just so you know what goes on behind the scenes, obviously we have a playlist set up with all the music that we're going to use, the incidental music during the show already set up.
180000	186000	And I'm supposed to hit stop before the next song comes on, because we put little breaks in the playlist, but sometimes I forget to hit stop.
186000	187000	Anyways...
187000	189000	Such as I've done for the past three weeks.
189000	196000	I've got a nice firmware that I got. I've got a nice 2GIG memory stick so I can put PlayStation 1 games on there.
196000	203000	So that's kind of what I was doing, because I have this other PlayStation, or PSP, and I'm like, well what the hell am I going to do with this thing?
203000	210000	So load up a custom firmware and I can make it all pretty, because you can edit all the icons, you can edit the waves in the background, everything.
210000	220000	And you run homebrew off of a memory stick, plus you can run programs that require firmware 310, or 303 I guess.
220000	223000	And so it's like the best of both worlds.
223000	225000	Alright.
225000	229000	Also joining us tonight, we don't have any other guests in studio, that's a first.
229000	234000	We haven't had that in a long time, so it's going to be a relatively quiet show tonight, I don't know.
234000	235000	We'll see.
235000	241000	The three of us will entertain you the best we can, but of course we always have our invisible other guests with us every week.
241000	245000	The chat room, and that's accessible over at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
245000	250000	XBStream, that's the name of the Xbox 360 program I was trying to think of at the beginning.
250000	254000	You can listen to us on XBStream, we're one of the default podcasts.
254000	255000	I forgot about that.
255000	260000	Thank you to the XBStream folks, and don't be too mad at me for forgetting your name.
260000	263000	Let's see, looking at the chat room there.
263000	266000	AlphaKennogram says, the soundboard is cursed!
266000	269000	We don't really use a soundboard, it's just Winamp, nothing too fancy.
269000	270000	It's Rob.
270000	271000	It's my fault.
271000	276000	Actually if I did switch to a soundboard it would probably be easier, but I don't like the whole soundboard setup thing.
276000	282000	Plus I feel like if I had a soundboard, I would use it far too much.
282000	289000	Not to say there's other shows out there that do use it too much, but I'm just thinking that we probably use it too much.
289000	293000	Blaze says that three weeks in a row they've effed up the soundboard.
293000	299000	I didn't eff up anything, I was sitting here in my chair, sitting here.
299000	304000	Alright, let's see, Damony says I got Crash Bandicoot on my PSP.
304000	312000	Remember when Crash Bandicoot was cool before it went the way of Spyro and all those other franchises, they just drove into the ground?
312000	313000	No, I never remember it being cool.
313000	314000	It was cool at one point.
314000	317000	Crash Bandicoot 2 was the first PlayStation game I ever owned.
317000	318000	I never remember that game being cool.
318000	319000	Well, whatever.
319000	322000	Let's see, what else is here?
322000	326000	Fireboma says, anyway, anyone here play Magic?
326000	327000	Like the Gathering?
327000	330000	Haven't since I was in college the first time around.
330000	337000	Dude, I sold my deck when I was a junior in high school, which was a long time ago, over ten years ago if you can believe it.
337000	338000	And it's still going strong.
338000	340000	I remember the old computer game.
340000	343000	Not the one you could play online, but the very first computer game that ever came out.
343000	344000	I really liked that.
344000	348000	I remember you walked around a map and battled other people.
348000	350000	I should try and find that and play it again.
350000	355000	It was kind of fun, but I don't think they really make it anymore because didn't they go online with it?
355000	359000	And then they tried to sell expansion cards online?
359000	361000	They tried to take the whole thing online?
361000	362000	I still don't remember that.
362000	364000	I don't remember.
364000	366000	Let's see.
366000	371000	SSJ100 Matt says, I remember the old Crash commercials where he would always cause trouble outside of Nintendo.
371000	372000	I remember that as well.
372000	374000	That's pretty cool.
374000	375000	Let's see.
375000	383000	Also, RK1hexAugust31st wants to know, what about the part where you call out the noobs?
383000	384000	Well, all right.
384000	385000	We can do that.
385000	386000	The noobs in chat tonight.
386000	389000	Of course, again, I'm going off memory.
389000	391000	Dark Soccer, you may have to help me if you don't recognize any of these names.
391000	394000	I think, well, first off, that name I just named is new.
394000	396000	RK1hexAugust31.
396000	397000	Let's see.
397000	399000	Broodwitch I think is new.
399000	402000	Alistar I recognize from our World of Warcraft guild.
402000	403000	Hello.
403000	404000	Let's see.
404000	405000	Who else is new?
405000	407000	I don't know if I recognize any other new names.
407000	408000	Jodrew?
408000	409000	Have we had that before?
409000	410000	I might be new too.
410000	411000	So there you have it.
411000	412000	Hello, noobs.
412000	413000	Everybody who's new.
413000	417000	The ones that I neglected to name and the ones that I may have named twice.
417000	418000	There you go.
418000	419000	Hi, monsters.
419000	420000	All right.
420000	421000	Wait.
421000	422000	Anyhow.
422000	424000	I just had it in my head because I just typed die, monster.
424000	426000	I meant hi, noobs.
426000	427000	All right.
427000	428000	Is there a Castlevania chat going on?
428000	432000	Someone said Rondo of Blood sucks, so I kicked whoever that was.
432000	433000	All right.
433000	436000	You're a big fan of Castlevania, obviously.
436000	437000	Symphony of the Night included.
437000	438000	No.
438000	440000	I like Metroid.
440000	443000	Look, I know you're really, well, then you should really like Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
443000	444000	I know.
444000	446000	Because it ripped off Metroid in many ways, but that's what made it so great.
446000	448000	I'm going to kick DM in too, just because.
448000	449000	Okay, do it.
449000	451000	What was I going to say?
451000	455000	Rondo of Blood you love, but Symphony of the Night was kind of in some ways a sequel to Rondo of Blood.
455000	457000	You love Symphony of the Night a lot, right?
457000	460000	Yeah, that was a sequel to Rondo of Blood.
460000	461000	Right.
461000	467000	Are you going to play it on Xbox Live Arcade, or are you going to say, eh, why should I download this?
467000	470000	I already have the PlayStation and Saturn and whatever else.
470000	477000	Saturn and I don't really have a need to, because I do have the other versions, so.
477000	480000	Although, to this one's credit, it'll be, you know.
480000	482000	If it's the Saturn version, hell yeah.
482000	483000	No, it won't be.
483000	484000	Then no.
484000	493000	It'll be enabled for your HDTV, granted it's got the stupid stagnant graphics on the side, but at least you won't have to worry about altering your TV settings or any of that stuff.
493000	496000	You can get messages from a lot of our listeners while you play.
496000	497000	Then no.
497000	499000	When I was playing DDR Universe this week, I got like 50.
499000	502000	I don't want messages arriving while I'm in the middle of the game.
502000	503000	You don't have to answer them.
503000	505000	I don't like seeing little things pop up on the middle of the game.
505000	506000	You can also ignore them.
506000	507000	You can turn that off.
507000	509000	I'm lazy.
509000	510000	I've been playing my PS3 today.
510000	511000	Well, that's your fault.
511000	515000	All right, well then let's get into how was your gaming week, because we always start off with a show with how was your gaming week.
515000	517000	So what have you been playing this week, Dark Sakura?
517000	526000	I played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance today on PS3, which was really, really good.
526000	528000	And we just got a new pinball machine.
528000	530000	I've got a bride of Pinbot now.
530000	533000	We're working on fixing it up, and that's really it.
533000	535000	I thought you said you played Marvel this week.
535000	536000	That's what I just said.
536000	538000	I played a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance today.
538000	539000	Well, tell me more about it.
539000	540000	What's the game like?
540000	543000	It actually is a really good game.
543000	549000	It's surprising, although the PS3 version, it obviously is just a port, because nothing is pretty or super.
549000	551000	Well, I mean, it's really pretty.
551000	555000	The gameplay itself, but the cinemas are not touched up for it.
555000	561000	But the only complaint I really have with that game is the camera sometimes getting a little bit weird,
561000	565000	and the bosses in the Atlantis level right now.
565000	569000	But it was really cool, because, like, dude, what the hell is Mysterio doing here?
569000	575000	And, like, I've determined that playing as Elektra sucks, but playing as Captain America is fucking awesome,
575000	578000	because he throws the shield and it bounces off the walls while you beat other stuff up,
578000	581000	and then, like, right when they're about to hit you, it bounces them in the head.
581000	584000	I seem to remember it was kind of that way in an old arcade game.
584000	588000	Didn't they have an old arcade Marvel game that you could play that was very similar?
588000	593000	Yeah, there was the Avengers game that was, you know, just one of those little side-scrolling basher things.
593000	596000	I seem to remember a shield kind of did the same thing, where it bounced around.
596000	597000	Dude, Captain America is awesome.
597000	598000	That's cool.
598000	600000	I have a mild obsession with Captain America right now.
600000	603000	And yes, as a SH-100, Matt and his Marvel does rock,
603000	609000	except I've decided that who rocks more than she does in that game is Spider-Woman.
609000	612000	For those that maybe don't follow comic books as heavily as you do,
612000	614000	because I know you're a bit of a comic fangirl,
614000	619000	but maybe, you know, I like the X-Men movie, I like the cartoons,
619000	623000	I know I'm somewhat familiar with the Marvel universe, but I don't really follow it.
623000	629000	So would there be anything for me in this game, or would I not appreciate it because I don't really follow Marvel?
629000	631000	I don't think you have to really follow it.
631000	634000	I mean, there's so much fun fan stuff thrown in that I think it's really great,
634000	638000	but I don't think you really need to be a big fan of, you know, Marvel comics to get into the game.
638000	644000	It does follow the established Marvel universe, although for some weird reason.
644000	648000	Like, a couple of the characters are in their Ultimate costumes,
648000	651000	but, like, I quickly went and changed all of them back to their regular universe ones,
651000	653000	but it was pretty cool.
653000	655000	That has Nick Fury in it, and he's awesome.
655000	659000	But not like the Ultimate version, where he's like Sammy L. Pimp, you know, Nick Fury,
659000	662000	it's like old-school eyepatch Nick Fury, which makes me happy.
662000	667000	And no, wait, I cannot believe you're betraying me like this.
667000	669000	It's our friend Brad from Pod Culture.
669000	671000	No, I don't like DC Comics.
671000	678000	Except for I like Birds of Prey, because it's very, you know, ambiguously lesbian-ish.
678000	681000	Wait, DC Comics is...
681000	682000	Superman.
682000	683000	Batman, too, right?
683000	684000	And Batman.
684000	689000	I love the X-Men, and I love the Avengers, except for Iron Man, because he's an asshole right now.
689000	691000	But I really like Captain America.
691000	696000	All right, let's see, I'm looking at the chat room to see some other comics here.
696000	699000	Some folks in there are explaining their gaming week.
699000	702000	Of course, I see Brad saying the DC universe beats Marvel every day.
702000	704000	Uh-oh.
704000	706000	What else is there?
706000	709000	Sounds like a lot of people playing Crackdown this week.
709000	711000	Somebody had said, I was looking, there it is.
711000	715000	Tiger Claw says, I remember the X-Men arcade game with the widescreen and the four players.
715000	717000	And that was the game that first came into my mind.
717000	720000	Although, obviously, Captain America wasn't in that game,
720000	723000	but I also remember that game very well from the arcades.
723000	727000	Like, it was one of those things where they put two TVs together to make the screen,
727000	730000	and it had the big line going down the middle because it was two monitors next to each other.
730000	732000	But that game was fun.
732000	734000	And it wasn't just four, couldn't you play that with six people?
734000	737000	I seem to remember, like, there was a mondo-sized version.
737000	738000	Six or eight.
738000	740000	The Golf Land had a one-point. You could play, like, six people.
740000	743000	Of course, if you were player one or player six, it sucked to be you,
743000	745000	because you were, like, standing on the side.
745000	747000	You could kind of only half see the screen.
747000	751000	Because they have, like, three monitors or whatever, and it's kind of wrapped around.
751000	752000	Yeah, that was a funny game.
752000	755000	It's like, I walked off the screen. Aw.
755000	759000	All right, I'm assuming Dark Soccer has done, so, Loki, how was your gaming week?
759000	761000	It was fun.
761000	763000	I played Crackdown a lot.
763000	767000	I actually finished the game, but I'm getting those last few achievements.
767000	772000	Like, I have everything maxed out except for firearms now, so I just have to max that out.
772000	775000	I'm already at level four on it, but just, you know, almost there.
775000	780000	And then I have to get the rest of the orbs and the hidden orbs and all that stuff.
780000	784000	So I'm just working on the last few achievements, but I'm done with the game, so, yay.
784000	787000	And then, what else?
787000	789000	Oh, I played DDR Universe, and that was okay.
789000	795000	It's good for DDR, I guess, but I got really uninterested, you know, after a while.
795000	800000	It took forever to unlock stuff, and it's kind of just, eh, don't care.
800000	803000	I really hate Quest Mode. I think it's retarded.
803000	806000	And, yeah, the Challenge Mode is kind of cool.
806000	814000	I really wish it was stuck with, like, the Interstellar Mode or whatever they had before in, like, Extreme 2 and stuff.
814000	819000	That was, Stellar Master Mode. That was a lot better than this crappy-ass Quest Mode.
819000	822000	It just has not gotten any better.
822000	829000	Bullet Witch. I played Bullet Witch a little bit, and everything bad that you've heard about that game is true.
829000	831000	It sucks balls.
831000	835000	It's really that bad. What exactly do you do in Bullet Witch? I've seen it, but I don't know much about it.
835000	838000	Bullet Witch, you just go around killing things, but the thing that sucks about it...
838000	839000	I like murder.
839000	846000	Okay, well, murder is good, but the game itself, there's no lock-on for anything, and the enemies are really fucking easy.
846000	853000	But then again, like I said, to be fair, I've only played it for a short amount of time, so I haven't really given it a fair shake yet,
853000	855000	but from what I've seen so far, it doesn't look good.
855000	862000	It looks like a game that was, like, first-gen PlayStation 2 or something, just really old.
862000	867000	I don't know. It just didn't feel very cool or anything, but, you know, whatever.
867000	874000	So I gave it a shot, and then I played the Armored Core 4 demo that's out in Japan right now,
874000	877000	and that one is awesome, and I can't wait to pick up the full game.
877000	879000	It's a lot faster than ChromeHounds.
879000	884000	If you were turned off by ChromeHounds, this might be the game for you, because it's a lot faster.
884000	889000	I mean, there's three fucking buttons for, you know, boost in the game, so, I mean, you gotta love that.
889000	893000	And it's just pretty cool. I like it.
893000	899000	Although it was in Japanese, so I didn't really know what they wanted me to do, but it was fun blowing up things.
899000	906000	So I'm really looking forward to that, and I think that's pretty much all I played this week.
906000	912000	Yeah, lots of Crackdown, though. I really need to play some co-op so I can get that last co-op achievement.
912000	917000	But, oh, there's some fun things to do in Crackdown. We were messing around with stuff.
917000	925000	Driving the semi-truck around and just boosting through pedestrians like crazy was fun.
925000	927000	Killing hundreds and hundreds of people.
927000	933000	And you can actually level up your driving pretty fast that way, because you end up killing more bad guys than you do the actual pedestrians.
933000	936000	I don't know. It was fun.
936000	940000	Alright. I also played a little bit of Crackdown this week, but not enough to really review the game.
940000	944000	And it's odd, because I don't really get into those types of games like Crackdown or Grand Theft Auto.
944000	949000	I mean, they're kind of fun for five minutes, but when I try to play the story mode, I don't really get into them as much.
949000	956000	So I can't really give the game a fair review yet, but I'm going to force myself to play a little more and try to look at it a little more from the perspective of,
956000	960000	well, okay, I realize I'm not a fan of this genre, but what my fans of the genre think of it.
960000	964000	But I'm more excited about getting to play the Halo 3 beta, finally, after all.
964000	967000	So I'm looking forward to that as part of Crackdown.
967000	977000	Also, games I did play a little more that I did get into this week. Missed Online, I finally checked out, which obviously existed a few years ago,
977000	982000	but kind of got the plug pulled on it before it really had a chance to be a flourished game.
982000	990000	So GameTap gave this thing CPR recently, and now it's up and running as of, I think, Valentine's Day or the day after is when they actually launched this.
990000	996000	So I went on there to check it out, very much unlike any other MMO you've ever played.
996000	999000	In fact, I don't even know if it would be fair to call this game an MMO,
999000	1006000	because if you think this is going to be like a Warcraft-y run quest, slash things, kill things, that's totally not like that.
1006000	1009000	You've got to remember, Missed was not like that. Missed was what?
1009000	1013000	It was a puzzle game where you didn't really know what the hell was going on.
1013000	1019000	You just knew you had to do things to unlock the way, and as you explored, you figured out more of the story.
1019000	1024000	So that's exactly what Missed Online is. It's a game of exploration with other people.
1024000	1028000	It's kind of weird at first because my brain wasn't really thinking that was what I was getting into,
1028000	1031000	although I should have known better because I played Missed back in the day.
1031000	1033000	But I'm thinking, oh, it's an MMO. We're going to go around and kill things.
1033000	1036000	No, no, no, no, no. It's nothing like that.
1036000	1041000	So the game itself controls a little weird and is a little jumpy.
1041000	1044000	I don't know if I dug the control scheme, but it's very simple.
1044000	1047000	It's a very easy game to kind of jump into.
1047000	1049000	Things I liked about the game.
1049000	1053000	I think the game is relatively good looking, especially when you consider the game is a couple years old.
1053000	1059000	I think the game also, as I said, is easy to really pick up and go.
1059000	1063000	I think it's got a very interesting story, and I really like the ambiance
1063000	1068000	because in many ways it felt like it was Silent Hill just with no zombies.
1068000	1071000	There was a part that actually scared me is that I was walking onto a bridge,
1071000	1074000	and suddenly the bridge collapsed, and I was like, ah!
1074000	1076000	But that just kind of shows how you can really get sucked into this game
1076000	1080000	because the acronym URU also stands for U-R-U.
1080000	1083000	So you're supposed to kind of envision that it's actually you in the world.
1083000	1087000	So the music and everything kind of adds this ambiance to it that I really liked.
1087000	1089000	Things I didn't like about the game.
1089000	1092000	Download times are atrocious.
1092000	1095000	I mean, having to patch the game earlier in the week,
1095000	1098000	there was no percentage bar or anything that showed me how long it was.
1098000	1100000	I swear the game took like an hour to patch.
1100000	1103000	Additionally, when you try to access new areas in game,
1103000	1106000	it takes a long time to load up the new areas of the game
1106000	1109000	because sometimes it's like you're downloading them before you even go there.
1109000	1112000	I understand it's trying to download the world on my computer,
1112000	1115000	but I kind of wish there was a little more forewarning or something.
1115000	1118000	I literally had to wait 30 minutes for some new area to download,
1118000	1123000	and I just bounced from spending only five minutes in another place.
1123000	1126000	I was just kind of exploring, walking around, and then suddenly, bam,
1126000	1129000	I got to wait 30 minutes with no real warning.
1129000	1132000	So the load times in the game I was not a fan of.
1132000	1135000	I do think, though, back to the positives,
1135000	1138000	I think if you're the type of person to get sucked into those reality gaming things,
1138000	1140000	what do they call those things?
1140000	1143000	Like the Loki or the alternate universe games?
1143000	1145000	ARGs? What is that?
1145000	1147000	Alternate reality gaming ARGs.
1147000	1149000	What are some of the popular ones?
1149000	1151000	I don't remember.
1151000	1155000	They have one right now for...
1155000	1157000	It's not really an alternate reality game.
1157000	1159000	I guess it's more of a viral site or something,
1159000	1163000	but sort of is.
1163000	1165000	What was it?
1165000	1168000	premiumtechpaper.com or something like that?
1168000	1171000	Okay, well, Myst is kind of something like that,
1171000	1174000	but it takes you to the next level.
1174000	1177000	Actually, that might be more of a viral site.
1177000	1180000	Myst Online really takes us to the next level,
1180000	1183000	because there are sites that are supposedly made by people in the cavern.
1183000	1186000	I think if you're into role-playing a little bit, you'd really be into it,
1186000	1189000	because there's people that play IC in cavern.
1189000	1192000	They pretend that they really are in the cavern,
1192000	1195000	and they really are exploring these worlds and talk with that perspective.
1195000	1199000	There's people that play OOC at a cavern and talk like it's normal.
1199000	1206000	The Myst Online guides give you this general overview of what to expect.
1206000	1210000	I think it's really cool that GameTap is really pouring their heart and soul into this game.
1210000	1216000	I'm very encouraged to see what kind of next MMO they jump onto next,
1216000	1218000	because it's obviously putting a lot of effort into Myst.
1218000	1220000	Oh, one other thing I should say about Myst.
1220000	1223000	There are live people that interact with the game as well,
1223000	1226000	and continue to develop the story.
1226000	1232000	Essentially, the players can change the story by interacting with the real-life actors.
1232000	1238000	They do this orientation every hour, Monday through Friday, from 5 to 10.
1238000	1239000	They do orientations every hour.
1239000	1242000	I actually went to one, and there was actually a guy there
1242000	1244000	that talked about what the universe was.
1244000	1248000	To make sure it wasn't a robot, I threw out a question, and he actually answered it.
1248000	1250000	He said there were live people just talking about the game,
1250000	1252000	and took you on a tour of the main area.
1252000	1257000	If you're really into those alternate reality things, you're going to get a kick out of it.
1257000	1262000	But if you want a game where you quest that has an objective,
1262000	1264000	that has set goals and things you do,
1264000	1267000	Myst Online isn't going to be really feeling it for you.
1267000	1272000	It doesn't seem like you really interact with people a lot in the beginning.
1272000	1274000	I think that's something you work towards.
1274000	1278000	If you're a GameTap subscriber, obviously you're already paying for Myst Online,
1278000	1280000	so go in there and look at it.
1280000	1281000	It's worth it.
1281000	1288000	If you're not already a subscriber of GameTap, is it worth it just for Myst Online?
1288000	1289000	I'm not sure.
1289000	1292000	You really need to check out the demo so you can see for yourself what I'm talking about,
1292000	1295000	that it's not your typical type of MMO, and make your decision from there.
1295000	1299000	I still recommend GameTap as a whole, because 800-something games for $9.95 a month.
1299000	1301000	I think it's a great service.
1301000	1303000	Sometimes I talk about it so well on the show, you'd think I'm on their payroll,
1303000	1304000	but I'm not.
1304000	1306000	I think it's a really great service.
1306000	1309000	If you're a GameTap subscriber, go check it out.
1309000	1311000	If you're out of the country where you don't get GameTap
1311000	1313000	and you're going to have to buy this game separately,
1313000	1318000	definitely download the demo first, because again, it's Myst, not World of Warcraft,
1318000	1321000	not Final Fantasy, any of that stuff.
1321000	1325000	Also, I checked out DDR Universe for the Xbox 360.
1325000	1327000	There's a lot of very good things about Universe.
1327000	1329000	There's a lot of very bad things about Universe.
1329000	1333000	Dance House Revolution Universe, the good things, song list, great.
1333000	1334000	I love the song list.
1334000	1337000	Graphics, pretty cool, a little bit vibrant.
1337000	1339000	I had to turn them down because they were a little too colorful,
1339000	1341000	but the videos are very well done.
1341000	1342000	They're vibrant.
1342000	1344000	Obviously, the game is in HD, which gives the game a whole new look.
1344000	1345000	It's very cool.
1345000	1349000	Things I didn't like, quest mode, quest mode, quest mode.
1349000	1351000	That mode is atrocious.
1351000	1354000	It's the worst thing that ever happened to DDR since True Kiss Destination.
1354000	1357000	Seriously, it's awful.
1357000	1360000	It is so awful. I can't even explain it.
1360000	1363000	There's no questing to it.
1363000	1367000	It's like you go to a city and you fucking,
1367000	1371000	we need to get some fame, play songs over and over and over.
1371000	1372000	There's no explanation.
1372000	1373000	It's poorly done.
1373000	1376000	It's basically the same five challenges over and over,
1376000	1378000	and they have to unlock things through this mode as a joke.
1378000	1379000	So if you're thinking that,
1379000	1382000	oh, I'm going to get a thousand easy points from DDR Universe,
1382000	1386000	no, you'll get about 400 from playing just play each song once.
1386000	1388000	But quest mode, it's not even worth it.
1388000	1391000	Seriously, wait and see if an unlock code is released.
1391000	1392000	Like remember Ultramix 2,
1392000	1394000	like an unlock code came out later that would give you all the unlocks?
1394000	1395000	Just wait for that.
1395000	1396000	See if something happens.
1396000	1397000	I don't know if there is one or not,
1397000	1399000	but hopefully there is because quest mode sucks.
1399000	1401000	It's just not even worth it.
1401000	1403000	So in other words,
1403000	1406000	if you are buying this game as a single player
1406000	1409000	who likes all that extra stuff inside DDR,
1409000	1412000	the game itself is really solid,
1412000	1414000	like the songs and the steps and everything,
1414000	1418000	but if you're buying this for quest mode or Xbox Live,
1418000	1420000	which basically has all the modes we've seen before,
1420000	1422000	I don't think there's really a whole lot else extra.
1422000	1423000	Let me put it this way.
1423000	1428000	If you're contemplating upgrading to Xbox 360 just for DDR, don't.
1428000	1430000	But if you are a 360 owner,
1430000	1432000	DDR is a very unique game,
1432000	1434000	and I think it's something you should check out.
1434000	1436000	And they made it very beginner friendly, which I think is cool.
1436000	1439000	And other good things I should say about it real quick,
1439000	1442000	other good things is that, again, it's very beginner friendly.
1442000	1446000	It does have the jukebox mode and the edit step and video mode,
1446000	1448000	which is kind of neat.
1448000	1450000	And again, the song list is great.
1450000	1451000	The downloads are pretty cool.
1451000	1453000	Yes, they're already on the disc,
1453000	1456000	but honestly, some of the Ultra Mixes were done the same way.
1456000	1457000	It's something extra.
1457000	1459000	It's not essential to the gameplay.
1459000	1463000	And the basic game itself is fine.
1463000	1466000	But again, some of those other things,
1466000	1471000	like just the fact that the frame rate is still a little buggy,
1471000	1472000	I swear to God,
1472000	1475000	Cowboy Emi has her head on backwards when you play on certain songs.
1475000	1477000	Check it out for yourself. I'm not joking.
1477000	1480000	For a DDR hardcore fan,
1480000	1483000	there's going to be some things in here that really irk you.
1483000	1484000	Here's my thing that pissed me off,
1484000	1485000	and I don't know if you noticed it.
1485000	1489000	Did you have trouble playing on a controller with the game?
1489000	1490000	Because I had steps.
1490000	1493000	I know I hit it on time,
1493000	1496000	and it gave me a good, or it gave me a complete miss.
1496000	1498000	And I'm just like, what the fuck?
1498000	1503000	And I think it was either lag or there was just some sort of frame rate problem.
1503000	1506000	Turn off the videos and dancers and see if you get the same thing.
1506000	1507000	I turned off the videos.
1507000	1508000	It was a little bit better.
1508000	1509000	But here's the thing, though.
1509000	1512000	You need the videos to be on in order to play Quest Mode
1512000	1517000	because you get special points if you buy the background videos in the game,
1517000	1518000	which is stupid.
1518000	1520000	I don't know.
1520000	1521000	All right.
1521000	1523000	So, you know, I don't know.
1523000	1526000	Again, I do think DDR Universe is a good DDR game
1526000	1529000	because essentially what does DDR end up being?
1529000	1531000	It's all about the songs and the steps,
1531000	1534000	and DDR delivers on some awesome songs and great steps.
1534000	1538000	But the other stuff kind of built around it, not so great.
1538000	1541000	And I really hope they patch it up with Universe 2.
1541000	1545000	And I was very disappointed to see some of those like frame rate things
1545000	1547000	and just that Quest Mode is so god awful
1547000	1551000	when the PlayStation 2 mixes had perfectly fine extra modes in them
1551000	1553000	that should have been brought over to the 360
1553000	1557000	or, you know, let the PlayStation 2 people come up with your modes
1557000	1559000	because Quest Mode is horrible.
1559000	1560000	It's horrid.
1560000	1562000	So that's it.
1562000	1563000	Okay.
1563000	1565000	So, LankyStyle, I noticed you just joined us.
1565000	1567000	Do you want to be on the radio tonight?
1567000	1568000	No.
1568000	1569000	Okay.
1569000	1571000	Well, tell us about your gaming week anyway because you're here
1571000	1573000	with your freshly shaved head, I notice.
1573000	1574000	Oh, yeah.
1574000	1575000	What's that about?
1575000	1576000	I just...
1576000	1577000	Britney Spears.
1577000	1578000	Oh, I was going to say Britney Spears.
1578000	1581000	Britney Spears did it, and I love her.
1581000	1583000	I want to do the spider with her.
1583000	1584000	All right.
1584000	1586000	Anyhow, let's not explain what that is.
1586000	1588000	How was your gaming week?
1588000	1589000	Pretty good.
1589000	1593000	I've been playing Final Fantasy XII and Final Fantasy VI for the GBA
1593000	1597000	and just dual wielding the Final Fantasies because that's what I do.
1597000	1600000	And good times.
1600000	1603000	Don't have any of the new systems because I'm old school.
1603000	1606000	But I did play DR Universe, which is pretty cool.
1606000	1609000	I like the license tracks on it,
1609000	1612000	but the old school tracks that they pulled back,
1612000	1613000	that they brought back, I don't know.
1613000	1615000	I don't think it was the best selection.
1615000	1618000	Well, they've kind of already pulled a lot back in the other Xbox games, right?
1618000	1619000	Yeah.
1619000	1621000	So they kind of, you know, they didn't want to repeat, so...
1621000	1622000	That's true.
1622000	1624000	I know it's kind of cool they got Hot Limit back.
1624000	1628000	Eh, gay.
1628000	1629000	All right.
1629000	1630000	Let's see.
1630000	1631000	Going to the chat.
1631000	1634000	I'm trying to see what's being talked about previously there.
1634000	1639000	Most people are kind of taken back by the True Kiss destination reference,
1639000	1642000	or True Kiss TKD reference I made earlier in the show.
1642000	1647000	And then somebody had to explain the DDR games that only came out in Japan.
1647000	1648000	Let's see.
1648000	1653000	Let's say there's controversy brewing over Rondo of Blood in chat.
1653000	1654000	All right.
1654000	1655000	Let's see.
1655000	1658000	Fireball wants to know why do I keep hearing aim noises in the background
1658000	1662000	because Jamie's chatting while the show's going on.
1662000	1663000	You got busted.
1663000	1668000	I always have it open just like for only one person who is listening to the show,
1668000	1672000	by the way, so I can keep in touch with Tiara.
1672000	1673000	Gotcha.
1673000	1674000	All righty.
1674000	1676000	Well, now that we've gone over all our gaming weeks,
1676000	1678000	we're going to start getting into some gaming news.
1678000	1680000	But first, some housekeeping.
1680000	1681000	Housekeeping this week.
1681000	1684000	First off, we want to say a big thank you and hug, hug, kiss, kiss
1684000	1688000	to PSP Fanboy who profiled us on their site this week.
1688000	1691000	They, you know, posted like,
1691000	1693000	hey, this is a cool show that you should download.
1693000	1696000	I think it's called RSS This, so they didn't have to do that,
1696000	1699000	so that was very nice, and we had no idea it was coming.
1699000	1701000	What's kind of funny about it, Jamie,
1701000	1703000	I'm not sure if you're aware what happened,
1703000	1705000	but when they originally posted the review,
1705000	1710000	they said something about it's really refreshing to have gay commentators
1710000	1714000	on the show because Sky is gay and Dark Sakura is a lesbian,
1714000	1719000	and that made me go I have a bad feeling this guy listened to the episode
1719000	1721000	where if you go back a couple episodes,
1721000	1724000	Dark Sakura and Chris were making those jokes back at each other
1724000	1726000	where Dark Sakura and Chris were joking
1726000	1728000	that they were going to go off and have sex.
1728000	1732000	So that made me kind of laugh.
1732000	1735000	So I replied, and I was like, actually, she's married.
1735000	1736000	You may not have caught that.
1736000	1740000	You may have downloaded the show where she was flirting with the lesbians,
1740000	1745000	but she's just a cool girl who doesn't really, you know, sexualities, whatever.
1745000	1748000	So there you go.
1748000	1752000	So they corrected the thing, but they still like the show.
1752000	1754000	I like boobs.
1754000	1757000	I know. You're cool. Whatever.
1757000	1759000	Oh, my God.
1759000	1762000	I think what it boils down to, it's not that you're necessarily straight
1762000	1765000	or you're a lesbian. You're just a slut.
1765000	1766000	No, I'm not.
1766000	1767000	I'm just kidding. You're not.
1767000	1769000	I've only slept with one person ever.
1769000	1770000	I know.
1770000	1771000	I'm saying this right now.
1771000	1777000	I'm in a monogamous relationship with my very first and only, so ha.
1777000	1779000	And you still can look at boobs.
1779000	1780000	There's nothing wrong with that.
1780000	1781000	Because boobs are hot and squishy.
1781000	1784000	Very cool.
1784000	1785000	All right.
1785000	1787000	Also, a couple other quick housekeeping things.
1787000	1791000	I want to point out over on Orangeloungeradio.com in our forums,
1791000	1794000	we've opened up our feedback threads a little early now.
1794000	1797000	So that way, those of you guys that are listening live,
1797000	1801000	A, if you're too chicken to join the chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com,
1801000	1805000	you can post in our forum your live feedback as the show is going.
1805000	1808000	And also, it's a good way for folks that are listening live
1808000	1809000	if they're in a chat room,
1809000	1811000	like if they had a favorite topic or quote
1811000	1813000	or some funny moment that they wanted to document,
1813000	1814000	that can go in the thread.
1814000	1816000	And that's really good in helping us to write our synopsis,
1816000	1818000	what you guys liked,
1818000	1820000	because then we kind of know what to feature in the show
1820000	1821000	because you guys say you liked it.
1821000	1823000	So just a little thing there.
1823000	1824000	Also, we want to mention this.
1824000	1826000	This doesn't directly have to do with us,
1826000	1830000	but we're kind of throwing our support behind it, shall we say.
1830000	1832000	Obviously, if you didn't already know,
1832000	1835000	Orange Lounge Radio is rebroadcast on a network called All Games,
1835000	1837000	available at allgames.com,
1837000	1840000	and we rebroadcast there in full parts A and B
1840000	1843000	Monday night at 5.30 Pacific time
1843000	1845000	and Tuesday mornings at 9 a.m. Pacific time.
1845000	1847000	And it's us syndicated on there,
1847000	1850000	as well as a bunch of other podcasts you may have heard of,
1850000	1854000	Evil Avatar, Chatterbox, Video Game Outsiders,
1854000	1857000	Game Attic Hotline, just to name a few.
1857000	1859000	There's a lot of good shows that are syndicated on there.
1859000	1863000	All Games is trying to build this community-type thing.
1863000	1869000	It's kind of like Myspace, but without the suck,
1869000	1871000	because Myspace, as nice as it is,
1871000	1873000	and you get a lot of attention there and everything,
1873000	1875000	the problem with Myspace is that I don't know about you guys,
1875000	1879000	but I'm getting all these cam girls and sluts
1879000	1882000	and hey, cam guys and everything that are trying to add me on there,
1882000	1885000	and you have to filter out all this spam and crap
1885000	1887000	to get through Myspace.
1887000	1891000	So I guess All Games found this other service called Ning
1891000	1893000	that allows you to create your own social network
1893000	1895000	without all the frickin' ads and all that stuff.
1895000	1896000	And that's pretty cool.
1896000	1898000	You can have your own blog on there and talk about stuff,
1898000	1900000	and then the blogs go to the front page,
1900000	1902000	and you can add your own videos and all that stuff.
1902000	1904000	So it's pretty cool.
1904000	1905000	I think we've all made profiles on there.
1905000	1907000	I know Dr. Sakura did. I did.
1907000	1909000	Loki, you're making one or will be making one.
1909000	1910000	Haven't made one yet, but yeah.
1910000	1911000	Would you? Okay.
1911000	1914000	So if you want to check that out, it's community.allgames.com.
1914000	1918000	And granted, we could have used Ning to make our own page,
1918000	1920000	our own social network, the Orange Lounge social network,
1920000	1922000	but we kind of didn't see the point
1922000	1925000	because we're all about indie podcasting,
1925000	1930000	and we know the reality is we're probably not the only game podcast you listen to.
1930000	1932000	And also, if you're an All Games listener,
1932000	1934000	most of the other podcasts you listen to are probably on All Games.
1934000	1938000	So why don't we all band together and contribute to this one network
1938000	1940000	as opposed to having ten little ones?
1940000	1942000	So there you have it.
1942000	1944000	I actually posted a blog post there today,
1944000	1947000	so go check it out and comment on it and tell me what you thought.
1947000	1949000	See? Isn't that cool?
1949000	1951000	All right. I think that's it for housekeeping.
1951000	1954000	So we will get into some game news now.
1954000	1956000	Who's starting us off tonight?
1956000	1959000	I do believe that would be me.
1959000	1960000	Congratulations.
1960000	1963000	Well, for all five of us who have PlayStation 3s,
1963000	1966000	we have something to look forward to.
1966000	1969000	The firmware is being updated to 1.54
1969000	1972000	that will add video chat features so that we can, I guess,
1972000	1976000	watch naked people and sweaty fanboys on the other side.
1976000	1981000	But if it's our screen format, hey, that'd be great.
1981000	1985000	And if you've also...
1985000	1989000	This, of course, is more going to go toward any of the UK listeners,
1989000	1992000	but if you've imported your PS3,
1992000	1995000	you'd go into the system menu and update via the Internet,
1995000	2000000	or you can download the firmware from the U.S. or Japanese support sites.
2000000	2003000	We actually have to pay 20 bucks for it.
2003000	2008000	I'm sorry, 20 bucks for Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection.
2008000	2011000	Over in the UK, that would be $6.99.
2011000	2015000	And that's really the only differences I'm seeing coming up with that.
2015000	2017000	I didn't download that either.
2017000	2020000	I was like, eh, no.
2020000	2024000	Twenty-some dollars is too much for me to pay for a game.
2024000	2026000	That you download.
2026000	2028000	I was going to say, you paid like 60 bucks for...
2028000	2032000	Yeah, but there's a big difference between Tekken and Dig Dug.
2032000	2035000	I'm also not a Tekken fan.
2035000	2038000	I'm not really a fighting game fan either.
2038000	2041000	I don't think Tekken is worth $600,
2041000	2044000	which is essentially what you're going to try to sell me on,
2044000	2046000	because I still don't have a PlayStation 3.
2046000	2048000	And Flow, I still haven't gotten Flow.
2048000	2050000	It's like, I have trouble paying $8.
2050000	2052000	You mean After Dark, the game?
2052000	2053000	Yeah, exactly.
2053000	2055000	They should have put toasters in there.
2055000	2056000	That would be even better.
2056000	2057000	That would be fun.
2057000	2060000	If you didn't listen to last week's show, by the way,
2060000	2066000	we did tell Sony exactly how to win the next gen war race.
2066000	2070000	And I'm thinking, even though we said this should be a retail game,
2070000	2073000	it may work if they put it on Xbox Live Marketplace.
2073000	2076000	And once again, that is Laser Cats the game.
2076000	2080000	If they can obtain the license to Laser Cats and get the exclusive
2080000	2083000	and put it on Xbox Live Market, or, whoops.
2083000	2084000	PlayStation Network.
2084000	2085000	See?
2085000	2086000	See where my mind goes?
2086000	2088000	I don't even realize there's a PlayStation Network,
2088000	2090000	so I'll have Laser Cats 3.
2090000	2094000	Well, if Xbox beats them to it, that's the nail in Sony's coffin.
2094000	2095000	So there you go.
2095000	2096000	It's a race now.
2096000	2098000	This is the real next gen wars.
2098000	2100000	Who will obtain Laser Cats the game,
2100000	2103000	because that will be the victor of the next gen war.
2103000	2108000	Now, not necessarily adding lasers to cats is a good idea.
2108000	2111000	I mean, for example, there was a game called Laser Dolphin
2111000	2115000	that came out that was basically a rip-off of Echo the Dolphin.
2115000	2118000	I think it might have even been made by the same people.
2118000	2120000	And, yeah, it sucked.
2120000	2123000	They basically added weapons to a bunch of the sea life,
2123000	2126000	and it wasn't very fun.
2126000	2130000	But they had dolphins with freaking laser on their heads.
2130000	2131000	So, I don't know.
2131000	2133000	It's a start.
2133000	2134000	It's a start.
2134000	2138000	Another start would be the future updates
2138000	2141000	getting some upscaling for your DVDs.
2141000	2146000	Now, this is, I think, a feature that's already on the Xbox 360,
2146000	2150000	and it's already on Blu-Ray players out there,
2150000	2152000	at least some of the Sony ones
2152000	2155000	and I think some of the other ones out there.
2155000	2158000	But that's something that's going to be coming later on.
2158000	2163000	Of course, normal DVDs upscaled look pretty good.
2163000	2168000	Not exactly going to be as great as content that was made for that resolution.
2168000	2170000	But, hey, something's better than nothing.
2170000	2173000	I'd rather have my DVDs look a little bit better.
2173000	2175000	So, hooray!
2175000	2177000	Something that's in the update other than video chat,
2177000	2178000	because guess what?
2178000	2180000	I don't have any friends on the PlayStation Network,
2180000	2182000	so video chat's kind of useless to me.
2182000	2184000	You have no friends on the PlayStation Network?
2184000	2186000	Yeah, I have Bobby on there, and that's about it.
2186000	2188000	That is the only friend on my friends list.
2188000	2190000	Aw, Bobby's your only friend?
2190000	2196000	And I don't even play online, really, with the PS3.
2196000	2198000	I've never played Resistance online,
2198000	2200000	which I really need to do because it's supposed to be pretty good.
2200000	2204000	And then Motorstorm, which this week we're going to have that,
2204000	2206000	and maybe I'll play that online,
2206000	2209000	but Motorstorm is not two-player split-screen.
2209000	2210000	That fucking sucks.
2210000	2213000	Why the hell can't they do split-screen games anymore?
2213000	2215000	Is it just too graphic-intensive?
2215000	2219000	Because you're essentially having to render the two things at once.
2219000	2222000	Well, I would think that the cell processor could handle that.
2222000	2223000	I don't know.
2223000	2227000	I mean, shit, it should be able to reconstruct my DNA.
2227000	2230000	I mean, the cell is awesome, right?
2230000	2233000	Anyways, so upscaling DVDs,
2233000	2238000	I think the cell processor should be able to do that, hopefully.
2238000	2241000	All right, let's see, going on to the chat room
2241000	2243000	and kind of looking at what's going on in chat.
2243000	2246000	Let's see, the Rob D. was correcting me from earlier
2246000	2248000	and said it's actually not $600.
2248000	2251000	It's $599 U.S. dollars.
2251000	2254000	Oh, sorry, but you forgot tax and all that other crap they throw in there.
2254000	2255000	$599, 99.
2255000	2256000	Yeah.
2256000	2258000	Let's see, Holy Shonen says,
2258000	2260000	Aw, poor Loki, Bobby, his only friend.
2260000	2263000	And Rama says, Loki is the Charlie Brown of Orange Lounge Radio.
2263000	2265000	Did you want to give out your username
2265000	2267000	so that other listeners can take pity on you
2267000	2268000	and you can have more than one friend?
2268000	2270000	It's just Loki space O-L-R.
2270000	2272000	Oh, there you go.
2272000	2273000	All right.
2273000	2276000	I don't think it's just no one has PlayStation 3s.
2276000	2277000	I have one.
2277000	2280000	Wait, why aren't you guys friends?
2280000	2282000	Because you don't like Loki?
2282000	2284000	Because she doesn't play her PlayStation 3.
2284000	2285000	Yes, I do.
2285000	2286000	I played it all day today.
2286000	2288000	I sold one of my PlayStation 3 games.
2288000	2289000	I sold Full Auto 2 finally.
2289000	2292000	I'm still keeping Ridge Racer 7 just for the fuck of it.
2292000	2293000	Because it's Ridge Racer.
2293000	2294000	Exactly.
2294000	2298000	It's Ridge Racer 6 and new packaging for the PlayStation 3.
2298000	2300000	Fucking 8.
2300000	2302000	I'm not buying Ridge Racer 8.
2302000	2304000	Hear me now, Namco.
2304000	2307000	You need to change more than just...
2307000	2310000	Look, the cars are a little bit more shiny.
2310000	2312000	And the tracks are a little bit more shiny.
2312000	2315000	What if Ridge Racer 8 allowed you to select
2315000	2317000	Toons is the driving cat as a driver?
2317000	2319000	Would you then buy Ridge Racer 8?
2319000	2320000	No, I wouldn't.
2320000	2324000	Although, if Ridge Racer 8 had tons of sluts everywhere,
2324000	2325000	then maybe.
2325000	2326000	That's what they need.
2326000	2328000	You know, the one cover chick is cool,
2328000	2330000	but you need lots of sluts.
2330000	2334000	You need this to be like an import magazine.
2334000	2336000	You know, fucking tuner shit.
2336000	2340000	Where you have hot Asian busty models everywhere.
2340000	2342000	This is what will sell Ridge Racer for you.
2342000	2343000	Why are you rolling your eyes, Jamie?
2343000	2345000	You just said five minutes ago you like boobs.
2345000	2346000	I wasn't rolling my eyes.
2346000	2347000	I was popping my neck.
2347000	2348000	Oh.
2348000	2350000	I'm telling you, this is what they need.
2350000	2352000	Because Ridge Racer doesn't really stand out.
2352000	2353000	And you know what?
2353000	2356000	Need for speed and fucking juiced and stuff
2356000	2359000	are kind of getting a little bit better.
2359000	2365000	But seriously, more women could never hurt.
2365000	2369000	Well, I don't know if there'd be anything in that for me.
2369000	2370000	Who cares?
2370000	2371000	You don't play Ridge Racer.
2371000	2372000	I do too.
2372000	2373000	I played Ridge Racer 6.
2373000	2375000	Then you'll like it with the women.
2375000	2376000	Fine.
2376000	2377000	I do like boobs.
2377000	2378000	It's fun.
2378000	2380000	Like she said, they're squishy.
2380000	2381000	They put it this way.
2381000	2382000	They make good pillows.
2382000	2384000	Well, if you like Ridge Racer as it is now,
2384000	2386000	then it won't matter.
2386000	2387000	Because they'll still be the same.
2387000	2389000	It'll just have extra women in there.
2389000	2392000	If the women aren't for you, then there you go.
2392000	2395000	You've still got Ridge Racer.
2395000	2396000	Let's see.
2396000	2397000	Fireboma says Ridge Racer 8.
2397000	2399000	Sluts everywhere.
2399000	2402000	Alpha Canogram gives the mandatory LOL sluts.
2402000	2406000	GS68 says Ridge Racer Xtreme Beach Volleyball.
2406000	2407000	There you go.
2407000	2409000	And Bobby Black Wolf just joined chat going,
2409000	2413000	did someone say my name?
2413000	2416000	To which Rob D promptly responded,
2416000	2419000	it's Loki's only friend, Black Wolf.
2419000	2430000	Are you going to put the patent down on this Ridge Racer?
2430000	2431000	Ridge Racer 8.
2431000	2433000	No, because they'll never do it.
2433000	2435000	I mean, they're still making weird.
2435000	2441000	They still think that fucking Peanuts is a valuable franchise to them.
2441000	2443000	I mean, come on.
2443000	2446000	All right.
2446000	2448000	Actually, I wanted to pull up here.
2448000	2450000	I actually have.
2450000	2454000	I overheard Black Wolf and Loki talking earlier,
2454000	2457000	and I actually found the theme song of their relationship.
2457000	2459000	So here it is.
2459000	2461000	I'm your only friend.
2461000	2463000	I'm not your only friend.
2463000	2465000	But I'm a little blowing friend.
2465000	2468000	But really, I'm not actually your friend.
2468000	2470000	But I am.
2470000	2472000	Haven't you ever heard this song in your life?
2472000	2478000	Never mind.
2478000	2479000	OK.
2479000	2481000	Joke gone wrong.
2481000	2485000	Also, something that went way wrong earlier this week
2485000	2488000	was the relationship between Kotaku and Sony.
2488000	2492000	Surely, if you've been anywhere on the internet this week on game blogs,
2492000	2494000	you've heard about this whole fiasco.
2494000	2496000	Basically, Kotaku published this rumor,
2496000	2499000	and the rumor is that PlayStation is going to be unveiling
2499000	2503000	the PlayStation Home at Game Developers Conference.
2503000	2507000	Quote, basically, you get to make an avatar for your console, like a me,
2507000	2509000	and this avatar has a room.
2509000	2512000	As you play games and accomplish certain tasks,
2512000	2514000	you will receive items with which to adorn the room
2514000	2516000	that are specific to the game, achievements.
2516000	2519000	The kicker is that this is going to be a new requirement
2519000	2521000	for every PlayStation 3 game.
2521000	2522000	Awesome.
2522000	2524000	PlayStation is doing something right.
2524000	2527000	They are ripping off some of the best parts of Nintendo and Microsoft,
2527000	2528000	which is what they need to do.
2528000	2529000	That's fine.
2529000	2530000	Everybody rips each other off.
2530000	2533000	They're ripping off the Wii and Animal Crossing from Nintendo.
2533000	2536000	They're ripping off the achievements from Xbox 360
2536000	2538000	and making a more dynamic online service to compete with them.
2538000	2539000	Great.
2539000	2541000	This sounds like a wonderful thing.
2541000	2543000	Certainly, this couldn't be bad press.
2543000	2545000	This is good news for Sony for once.
2545000	2546000	And what does Sony do?
2546000	2550000	They fuck it up with bad press because suddenly,
2550000	2553000	like not even five minutes after this rumor goes up,
2553000	2557000	Kotaku gets this huge Yudon fucked up letter from Sony.
2557000	2559000	I don't have the letter in front of me,
2559000	2563000	but essentially it said you're a bad person for running that story.
2563000	2567000	Therefore, you're uninvited from our press conferences.
2567000	2569000	We want you to send the dev kit back.
2569000	2571000	We're slapping you on the wrist, blah, blah, blah.
2571000	2575000	It is the equivalent of playing Monopoly with somebody who's losing,
2575000	2577000	and they throw the board up in the air and say,
2577000	2578000	Fuck this game.
2578000	2580000	I'm taking my board home.
2580000	2582000	That's basically what happened, yes?
2582000	2583000	Fair to say?
2583000	2590000	Yeah, and they're worried about negative press from the story.
2590000	2594000	So this catches wildfire because everybody's like,
2594000	2596000	What the hell did Kotaku do wrong?
2596000	2599000	Not only did they pretty much prove this rumor to be true,
2599000	2601000	I mean, come on.
2601000	2603000	Is there any way this rumor could not be true?
2603000	2605000	Well, that and the fact that they've also registered trademarks
2605000	2607000	for PlayStation Home.
2607000	2608000	That came out later.
2608000	2609000	You're jumping in later.
2609000	2610000	Sorry.
2610000	2612000	But now we all knew the damn thing was true.
2612000	2613000	What they really had to do is just...
2613000	2615000	We do not comment on rumors.
2615000	2617000	If Sony had kept their mouth shut,
2617000	2619000	they could have still had somewhat of a surprise
2619000	2620000	at Game Developers Conference.
2620000	2622000	But from this happening, did they not think,
2622000	2626000	Oh, well, if we're going to slap Kotaku's wrist,
2626000	2628000	don't you think they're probably going to blog about it
2628000	2630000	since obviously Sony doesn't care about him anymore?
2630000	2633000	Well, here's the other thing that I think is kind of bad.
2633000	2635000	Real quick, obviously the rest of the story is
2635000	2637000	the rest of the internet banded behind Kotaku.
2637000	2639000	It got on Digg.
2639000	2641000	Even other blogs like Destructoid
2641000	2643000	changed their title banner to basically say,
2643000	2645000	Brian Crescente has the biggest balls in the world,
2645000	2647000	something like that.
2647000	2650000	The entire internet is jumping behind what Kotaku did,
2650000	2655000	and Sony got its tail between its legs now,
2655000	2658000	has to go, Oh, we made a mistake.
2658000	2660000	Kotaku, can we play nice again?
2660000	2661000	And they made up.
2661000	2662000	They kissed and made up.
2662000	2664000	Well, here's the whole thing.
2664000	2666000	The big focus wasn't about this whole story.
2666000	2670000	It was that Sony was trying to dictate to a blog
2670000	2674000	what stories they could post and what they can't.
2674000	2676000	They're reporting on stuff.
2676000	2678000	It's free speech.
2678000	2680000	They can do whatever the fuck they want.
2680000	2683000	It's like if there's a negative story about them,
2683000	2685000	they don't want anything to do with you.
2685000	2687000	So it's kind of like they want this blog
2687000	2689000	to be in their pocket type thing.
2689000	2694000	But of course they have better journalistic integrity
2694000	2698000	than Sony had believed, so it didn't quite go their way.
2698000	2701000	They thought, Oh, big bad, Sony's going to make a huff and puff,
2701000	2704000	and they're going to just be like, Oh, okay, we'll take the story down then.
2704000	2707000	Rama says, Sky, the whole Kotaku Sony thing
2707000	2709000	was a damn publicity stunt.
2709000	2710000	What do you think?
2710000	2711000	No.
2711000	2712000	Where's the evidence to back that up?
2712000	2713000	I don't know.
2713000	2714000	It's not a publicity stunt.
2714000	2716000	I think it's just being stupid.
2716000	2721000	Why wouldn't Sony use their own three something,
2721000	2723000	that site they have?
2723000	2725000	It's called like three...
2725000	2727000	I keep thinking of Frogger 2 three deep.
2727000	2729000	I don't know why, but they have...
2729000	2730000	Yes, please.
2730000	2732000	Blog site's called Frogger 2 three.
2732000	2733000	Could I have said anything more random?
2733000	2735000	They have some site, three something,
2735000	2736000	that shows how much we care.
2736000	2737000	Three play.
2737000	2738000	Thank you.
2738000	2739000	You knew that the whole time.
2739000	2741000	You just wanted to watch me struggle.
2741000	2743000	They had three play or whatever.
2743000	2745000	Couldn't they have just used that for their publicity?
2745000	2746000	Or is it because no one reads three play?
2746000	2747000	It was probably this.
2747000	2750000	It was probably that the news sounds very much like,
2750000	2751000	Mm, they're ripping off people,
2751000	2755000	and they're probably going to go, Mm, this is our original idea.
2755000	2757000	We were the first to ever have achievements.
2757000	2759000	I could see them saying that.
2759000	2762000	Yo, Microsoft's copying us.
2762000	2765000	It's just retards like that.
2765000	2768000	I can't help, I know...
2768000	2770000	I don't know.
2770000	2772000	Great, I guess, that they're doing this.
2772000	2773000	Cool.
2773000	2775000	I'm not going to buy more games, though, because of it.
2775000	2776000	I'm sorry.
2776000	2778000	Microsoft was smart to do the achievements,
2778000	2779000	because I'm a sucker,
2779000	2781000	and I buy crappy games like Bullet Witch,
2781000	2783000	because of this shit.
2783000	2786000	And no matter how hard I try,
2786000	2789000	I can't do that, because I'm hooked, like crack.
2789000	2792000	And so, you know, the PlayStation Network or whatever,
2792000	2795000	great, I get crap for my virtual house.
2795000	2796000	That's awesome.
2796000	2797000	I'll show it to all my friends.
2797000	2800000	Oh, wait, Bobby is my only friend on there.
2800000	2802000	So, great, that's going to be awesome.
2802000	2806000	I can't wait to show all my friend, you know.
2806000	2808000	It's just stupid, though.
2808000	2809000	That's the problem.
2809000	2810000	They don't get it.
2810000	2814000	It's not because people are not buying a PlayStation 3
2814000	2815000	or going on their network service,
2815000	2818000	because there's no achievements or Miis.
2818000	2823000	It's because it's $600, not because there's no Miis.
2823000	2828000	I didn't go, oh, wow, you know, there's Miis on here now.
2828000	2830000	I guess I'll spend $600 on a PlayStation 3.
2830000	2835000	No, that's not the reason why people aren't buying your platform.
2835000	2837000	Jamie, you want to chime in?
2837000	2839000	I like Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2839000	2844000	Okay, what if, let's say PlayStation puts out a patch.
2844000	2846000	They actually do have an online version on that, by the way.
2846000	2848000	Well, let's say PlayStation comes out with a patch
2848000	2850000	and all the old games get this too,
2850000	2852000	because there's relatively enough games out there
2852000	2855000	where they could go back to all the old games and patch them.
2855000	2859000	And let's say you could get a Captain America shield in your house from playing.
2859000	2860000	Would that be cool?
2860000	2862000	Yes, it would.
2862000	2866000	But is that enough to be like a real robust feature
2866000	2867000	that could sell the PlayStation 3?
2867000	2869000	It's like, hey, come over to my house.
2869000	2871000	I've got a Captain America shield.
2871000	2873000	My answer time.
2873000	2875000	It would be, hey, come over to my house,
2875000	2877000	I have a Captain America shield in it.
2877000	2881000	If it were like something where the whole environment
2881000	2883000	was very like Animal Crossing,
2883000	2884000	where you can walk around and talk to people
2884000	2888000	in like this big online chat room almost with avatars,
2888000	2889000	that would be kind of cool.
2889000	2890000	Which it could be.
2890000	2893000	Keep in mind, it hasn't been officially announced yet.
2893000	2895000	If it was browser the MMO or something,
2895000	2896000	then that would be one.
2896000	2898000	I don't think it's enough to sell the system.
2898000	2899000	That's exactly what I think,
2899000	2902000	is that I don't think it's $600 cool,
2902000	2906000	but Sony badly needs something cute like this
2906000	2910000	to kind of help their image, if that makes any sense.
2910000	2912000	Like they really need something like this.
2912000	2914000	But again, it boils down to the games.
2914000	2917000	Well, they need something also to flesh out their network
2917000	2919000	because right now their network's just kind of a clusterfuck of,
2919000	2921000	I don't know what's going on, you know.
2921000	2925000	I mean, there's no downloadable content for the games.
2925000	2928000	There's hardly any demos online.
2928000	2931000	There's hardly any download content other than PlayStation 1 games.
2931000	2933000	Great! PlayStation 1 games.
2933000	2935000	I need a PS3 to download games to my PSP.
2935000	2938000	Which, by the way, people have broke already,
2938000	2943000	so you can, you know, copy them and completely, you know, pirate the shit.
2943000	2950000	But it's like there's no motivation for me to go online with this thing at all.
2950000	2953000	I mean, I'm sorry.
2953000	2955000	There's just, Motorstorm's going to be a great game.
2955000	2956000	Great.
2956000	2960000	I feel like I should buy a PlayStation 3 just to be your friend
2960000	2961000	and take pity on you.
2961000	2964000	I just, I feel so bad for you and you're my friend.
2964000	2966000	Why? I don't play my PlayStation 3.
2966000	2969000	I play my 360 and I've been playing the Wii a little bit,
2969000	2970000	but mainly my 360.
2970000	2972000	And there was a time when I was playing Resistance,
2972000	2975000	I'm like, well, I don't know when am I going to go back and play my 360.
2975000	2977000	Well, it didn't take long to finish Resistance
2977000	2979000	and then there's no reason to play it anymore.
2979000	2984000	So now I'm back to playing my 360 where there's a bunch of new shit coming out,
2984000	2989000	which is great, you know, but PlayStation 3 doesn't have anything really unique to it.
2989000	2991000	It's everything, if I'm going to get a game,
2991000	2994000	I'm going to get it on the 360 because it has achievements.
2994000	2996000	Black Wolf's getting a little territorial.
2996000	2999000	Black Wolf says, no, Sky, he's my friend.
2999000	3002000	You stay back, bitch.
3002000	3004000	You can add me and Dan.
3004000	3005000	We're on there as Gunstar Hero.
3005000	3009000	Cue the scary music theme, single white female, whatever.
3009000	3012000	All right, so definitely something that we'll continue to develop next week,
3012000	3015000	a Game Developers Conference when they actually announced it.
3015000	3017000	Oh, wait, sorry, it's supposed to be a rumor, but come on,
3017000	3019000	we all know it's probably true.
3019000	3020000	It is true.
3020000	3022000	They've already registered the fucking trademarks for it.
3022000	3023000	They got a logo for it.
3023000	3025000	It's coming out.
3025000	3030000	They just didn't want it to look like this was something that they thought up real quick
3030000	3034000	or anything like, I don't know, a six-axis controller.
3034000	3037000	We always meant for that to have tilt control.
3037000	3041000	It wasn't like after we saw the Wii or anything that we decided to put this in here.
3041000	3045000	Could someone going to Game Developers Conference randomly shout out,
3045000	3049000	I love you Kotaku, during the Sony press conference like after or before
3049000	3050000	when everybody's coming in?
3050000	3053000	I would do it myself, but I'm afraid of getting kicked out.
3053000	3055000	So I need someone with bigger balls.
3055000	3059000	I can't even go, so at least I didn't get invited.
3059000	3061000	You can just go.
3061000	3062000	Is it free?
3062000	3064000	Well, if you're a press, yes.
3064000	3066000	I think you'd have to register, though.
3066000	3068000	You can do it at the thing.
3068000	3069000	You can't do that.
3069000	3070000	Yes, you can.
3070000	3071000	Anyway, I'll talk to you offline.
3071000	3075000	All right, let's go ahead and move on to the next story.
3075000	3079000	Well, there is a little bit more from Sony.
3079000	3085000	They have their launch lineup for the European PlayStation Network.
3085000	3090000	There will be a few downloads available on March 23rd,
3090000	3093000	some 5 Dark Resurrection for £6.99,
3093000	3095000	Blast Factor for £3.49,
3095000	3099000	and Gran Turismo HD Trial for free.
3099000	3102000	Other games that are set to come out are on the 30th,
3102000	3106000	Super Rub-a-Dub, which is a duct,
3106000	3110000	6th of April, Flow, 13th April, Go Sudoku,
3110000	3113000	and 20th April, Go Puzzle.
3113000	3116000	So there's just a few things available for that.
3116000	3118000	Have you noticed that a lot of their games that they make
3118000	3121000	for the online network that use 6-axis tilt controls
3121000	3124000	are just games where it's involving you shooting something
3124000	3128000	or something in water that you tilt the thing around.
3128000	3131000	That is like the only thing that the 6-axis is good for
3131000	3134000	is like fucking Etch A Sketch shit.
3134000	3136000	For the record, I hate the 6-axis.
3136000	3137000	Actually...
3137000	3138000	I hate it.
3138000	3139000	Why?
3139000	3142000	Because you had to do shit with it on Marvel Ultimate Alliance
3142000	3144000	and it's so fucking unwieldy.
3144000	3146000	It just is an annoyance.
3146000	3148000	Actually, that would be kind of funny as an Etch A Sketch
3148000	3150000	because you could use the analog sticks and use the dials
3150000	3153000	and then you could shake the controller to clear it.
3153000	3154000	I don't know.
3154000	3155000	They should make downloadable...
3155000	3156000	But what if I had Parkinson's
3156000	3158000	and I'd never be able to draw anything?
3158000	3159000	Well...
3159000	3160000	I don't know.
3160000	3161000	Don't buy that then.
3161000	3162000	Don't buy a Wii.
3162000	3163000	Buy a 360 then.
3163000	3164000	Alright.
3164000	3165000	I will.
3165000	3167000	The 360 will rumble for you.
3167000	3170000	Anyways, so...
3170000	3172000	Apparently, there's been some rumors going around
3172000	3175000	that the 20 gigabyte version of the PlayStation 3
3175000	3177000	is on its way out.
3177000	3178000	And...
3178000	3180000	Sony, of course, is saying,
3180000	3182000	no, that's not the case.
3182000	3183000	It's just...
3183000	3185000	You know, that model, it's...
3185000	3187000	Depending up to the stores, you know,
3187000	3189000	what they want to carry in their store,
3189000	3191000	whether the 60 gig or 20 gig,
3191000	3193000	and unfortunately, the 60 gigs,
3193000	3195000	they're doing more than the 20 gigs,
3195000	3197000	so people are bringing in less 20 gig systems
3197000	3199000	into their stores.
3199000	3202000	Personally, though, from a distributor standpoint,
3202000	3205000	we can't get 20 gigs anymore.
3205000	3207000	The company we get them through won't sell them anymore.
3207000	3209000	So...
3209000	3211000	Take that as you will.
3211000	3213000	So, they may not be on the way out,
3213000	3214000	but they sort of are on the way out
3214000	3216000	because the 60 gigs they're selling in.
3216000	3219000	I heard a rumor that it might actually be cheaper
3219000	3221000	for them to produce a 60 gig over the 20 gig,
3221000	3223000	which that doesn't make any sense, but...
3223000	3224000	You know, whatever.
3224000	3227000	I guess, you know, maybe they may announce something
3227000	3230000	at Game Developers Conference, you know,
3230000	3232000	that they're redesigning the PS3
3232000	3234000	or something like that, so...
3234000	3236000	Now in pretty colors!
3236000	3237000	Oh, yeah.
3237000	3238000	You know what?
3238000	3240000	That might be pretty smart to beat Nintendo
3240000	3241000	to the market with that kind of crap.
3241000	3242000	Beat them at their own game?
3242000	3244000	Yeah, exactly.
3244000	3246000	Well, unless they come out and say,
3246000	3250000	now in pretty colors and $200 cheaper,
3250000	3253000	I don't know if I'm sold yet.
3253000	3255000	Anyhow, something that might bring some people
3255000	3257000	back to the PlayStation 3,
3257000	3259000	including Hideo Kojima,
3259000	3261000	you know, if you can think back to an old story.
3261000	3263000	I mean, yes, we all know Metal Gear Solid 4
3263000	3265000	is coming out on 360, but...
3265000	3267000	I can't get Microsoft out of my mind tonight.
3267000	3268000	What the fuck?
3268000	3270000	Apparently, Metal Gear Solid 4
3270000	3272000	is coming out on PlayStation 3,
3272000	3274000	but what did Kojima say he missed?
3274000	3275000	Rumble, right?
3275000	3277000	And that was an essential part of Metal Gear Solid,
3277000	3280000	and obviously Rumble is not on the PlayStation 3.
3280000	3284000	Well, apparently Rumble could be coming back,
3284000	3286000	and the reason why we say could be
3286000	3289000	is because Sony and Immersion have settled
3289000	3291000	their patent litigation.
3291000	3292000	Think back, in the past,
3292000	3294000	Immersion sued Sony over the Rumble thing.
3294000	3296000	They actually settled with Microsoft,
3296000	3300000	and I believe Nintendo had already worked it out
3300000	3302000	with Immersion before they ever put it in there.
3302000	3304000	They worked it out with the other two companies.
3304000	3306000	That's why you have Rumble and the 360 and the Wii.
3306000	3308000	But Sony was just like, well, screw you.
3308000	3310000	We're not going to have Rumble then.
3310000	3312000	Rumble is so last-gen, if it's going to be like that.
3312000	3315000	Since Wii can dictate what is next-gen and what is not,
3315000	3318000	we're just going to say Rumble is so last-gen.
3318000	3321000	Sony seems like a big, whiny child to me.
3321000	3327000	They think they have the edge on the competition,
3327000	3329000	but really, they're just kind of trailing behind
3329000	3331000	in ideas and innovation.
3331000	3332000	This time.
3332000	3334000	Well, this time, I mean, all the time.
3334000	3336000	When have they been ahead?
3336000	3339000	Okay, granted, they had a DVD drive in the PlayStation 2.
3339000	3341000	Okay, good for them.
3341000	3342000	That's good.
3342000	3345000	On top of PlayStation 1 and 2, they were a little bit ahead of time.
3345000	3348000	They were behind on the fucking Rumble technology.
3348000	3352000	They're behind on analog sticks on there.
3352000	3354000	And even the controller designs,
3354000	3356000	fucking copying off of the Super Nintendo.
3356000	3358000	So, I don't know.
3358000	3360000	They're just playing the copycat game.
3360000	3362000	Oh, they did it pretty well the last two gens.
3362000	3363000	Well...
3363000	3364000	All right, well, anyway.
3364000	3366000	What makes this whole thing very interesting
3366000	3368000	is what Kazurai had to say after this whole thing.
3368000	3369000	Quote,
3369000	3372000	We look forward to exploring with Immersion exciting new ways
3372000	3376000	to bring the largest and best range of gameplay experiences to our customers.
3376000	3379000	We are very excited about our new partnership with Immersion
3379000	3381000	and the potential for new and innovative products
3381000	3383000	incorporating their technologies.
3383000	3385000	Great, I gotta buy new controllers now.
3385000	3387000	Thank you very much.
3387000	3389000	I hope I can trade them in.
3389000	3392000	Interesting, I guess is all I can say.
3392000	3395000	I mean, not even like three days ago,
3395000	3397000	someone over at Sony, I don't remember who said it,
3397000	3401000	but somebody said it was probably that crazy guy from Sony Europe,
3401000	3402000	Phil Harrison.
3402000	3404000	I think he was the one that said,
3404000	3411000	Rubble is so last gen.
3411000	3415000	And now things seem to change on a dime yet again.
3415000	3418000	Well...
3418000	3420000	We do, though.
3420000	3423000	Anything in this industry, though, does change pretty crazy,
3423000	3425000	including release dates.
3425000	3429000	However, I have a fairly decent list for our UK listeners.
3429000	3434000	So, starting with the releases on the 5th,
3434000	3437000	which would be tomorrow for us, actually it's the 5th there already,
3437000	3440000	is Wario Master of Disguise in the DS.
3440000	3443000	Coming up on the 9th is Bullet Witch,
3443000	3444000	Castlevania Portrait of Ruin,
3444000	3445000	Garfield's Nightmare,
3445000	3447000	Grand Theft Auto by City Stories,
3447000	3448000	Luminesce Plus,
3448000	3450000	Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2,
3450000	3451000	March of the Minis,
3451000	3452000	Rogue Galaxy,
3452000	3453000	Runaway 2,
3453000	3454000	The Dream of the Turtle,
3454000	3455000	Silver Fall,
3455000	3456000	The Hustle of Detroit Streets,
3456000	3459000	Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2,
3459000	3463000	and Trackmania United on PC.
3463000	3464000	Cool.
3464000	3468000	We actually have a pretty good week as far as release dates in the United States.
3468000	3470000	Definitely some good stuff,
3470000	3472000	especially one of my favorites,
3472000	3473000	coming to the Playstation 2,
3473000	3475000	Grand Theft Auto by City Stories,
3475000	3478000	for the whopping cheap price of $19.99.
3478000	3480000	So, you should definitely check it out.
3480000	3482000	Of course, I don't think there's going to be multiplayer in there,
3482000	3483000	so that kind of sucks.
3483000	3484000	Let's see,
3484000	3488000	Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 for the 360 and the PC,
3488000	3492000	Def Jam Icon for Playstation 3 and the 360.
3492000	3493000	That should be pretty cool.
3493000	3498000	Titan Quest Immortal Throne for the PC.
3498000	3499000	Let's see,
3499000	3502000	Motorstorm on the Playstation 3.
3502000	3503000	Can't wait to pick that one up.
3503000	3506000	Wario, Master of Disguise on the DS,
3506000	3509000	as well as I believe Rayman's Raving Rabbids,
3509000	3514000	and Shrek's Smash and Crash Racing on the DS.
3514000	3518000	Burnout Dominator on Playstation 2 and the PSP,
3518000	3521000	and it looks like Tortuga,
3521000	3524000	Two Treasures on the PC.
3524000	3528000	I do believe there's also a Sudoku game coming out as well,
3528000	3532000	but I don't think anyone's going to pick that up.
3532000	3535000	But that's the big stuff.
3535000	3536000	All right.
3536000	3540000	Oh, NBA Street Home Court on the PS3, that's right.
3540000	3541000	Coming out over in Japan,
3541000	3544000	because sometimes the games that we get over here
3544000	3547000	are often based off what comes out in Japan.
3547000	3548000	Over on the Playstation 3,
3548000	3551000	Power Smash 3 is coming out from Sega,
3551000	3553000	but you know the series as Virtua Tennis,
3553000	3556000	and that's coming out on March the 8th.
3556000	3557000	On some other systems,
3557000	3558000	over on the Nintendo Wii,
3558000	3562000	Bomberman Land Wii is coming out on March 8th.
3562000	3563000	See, this is why I like doing the same.
3563000	3566000	I didn't even know they were making a freaking Bomberman game for the Wii,
3566000	3567000	so there you have it.
3567000	3570000	Hopefully much better than Bomberman Act Zero.
3570000	3573000	Hopefully they don't take Bomberman into the future.
3573000	3574000	We'll see what happens.
3574000	3577000	A game called iShield 21 from Nintendo
3577000	3581000	is actually coming out over in Japan this week as well.
3581000	3584000	It looks like it could be a fighting game or something.
3584000	3586000	I'm not sure exactly what this is.
3586000	3588000	They file it into the...
3588000	3590000	It's actually more of an action game, it looks like.
3590000	3592000	I'm trying to see what some of the screenshots look like.
3592000	3594000	Looks like it has a bunch of different modes in it there,
3594000	3597000	like you kick a ball in one mode as a football player.
3597000	3600000	Looks like another one you kind of throw a football.
3600000	3606000	I think it might be an amateur Olympics type of game.
3606000	3607000	So there you have it.
3607000	3610000	Maybe someone in chat will pipe up who knows more about that game.
3610000	3611000	Which one?
3611000	3614000	It's called iShield 21.
3614000	3618000	It's an anime-based football game, I think.
3618000	3619000	Interesting.
3619000	3620000	If I remember correctly.
3620000	3622000	And it's just like, I guess, Imagine Madden,
3622000	3626000	but with fictional football characters, they're anime.
3626000	3627000	Alright.
3627000	3630000	Coming out on the PlayStation 2,
3630000	3634000	you have Guitar Freaks and Drummania Masterpiece Gold
3634000	3636000	coming out over in Japan.
3636000	3638000	You used to import all those Guitar Freaks games, Jamie.
3638000	3639000	Are you going to get this one?
3639000	3640000	No.
3640000	3641000	Why not? What made you stop?
3641000	3644000	I have a life.
3644000	3645000	Alrighty then.
3645000	3649000	Major League Baseball 2K6 comes out of Japan
3649000	3651000	for the PlayStation 2 on March 8th.
3651000	3652000	2K6?
3652000	3653000	That's what it says, 2K6.
3653000	3654000	Probably 2K7.
3654000	3655000	Is that a typo?
3655000	3656000	It could be.
3656000	3657000	Probably.
3657000	3658000	No, that's the screenshot for 2K6.
3658000	3659000	Holy crap, they're behind.
3659000	3660000	Little bit.
3660000	3661000	That's probably 2K7.
3661000	3664000	I don't know why you would want to purchase 2K6.
3664000	3666000	Maybe they're just a little behind.
3666000	3669000	Kenka Banchu 2 Full Throttle also comes out
3669000	3672000	on the PlayStation 2 this week.
3672000	3674000	It's another action game.
3674000	3676000	Looks like it's probably based on an anime.
3676000	3679000	Little fighting game, scary looking man in that game.
3679000	3681000	Let's see if there's any other systems
3681000	3682000	I want to announce release dates for.
3682000	3683000	How about Nintendo DS?
3683000	3685000	There's a whole lot of crap coming out on the DS
3685000	3686000	this next week.
3686000	3689000	Doraemon is coming out.
3689000	3694000	Doraemon Nobita no Shinmaki Daibouken is coming out.
3694000	3697000	Dragon Sakura DS is coming out as well.
3697000	3700000	EQ Trainer DS, another one of those training games.
3700000	3701000	Fun.
3701000	3704000	Let's see, a couple of games in the puzzle series
3704000	3707000	from Hudson also coming out as well.
3707000	3709000	I should mention this because this is probably
3709000	3711000	the biggest release of the week over for Japan.
3711000	3715000	Second Detsetsu Heroes of Mana coming out
3715000	3716000	from Square Enix.
3716000	3718000	I imagine that would be the next Mana game
3718000	3720000	that we're going to get over here.
3720000	3722000	We're getting Dawn of Mana next.
3722000	3724000	It's probably the same thing, just a different name.
3724000	3727000	That's, of course, speculation from someone
3727000	3729000	who has not done their research on what exactly
3729000	3731000	that game is.
3731000	3732000	No problem.
3732000	3733000	I forgot to mention there was some exclusive stuff
3733000	3735000	that we had, of course, this week for release.
3735000	3737000	It's very small though.
3737000	3740000	There's a brand new Wii game coming out later this year.
3740000	3742000	Dave Mirra BMX Challenge for the Wii
3742000	3746000	coming out November, or not November, July 11th.
3746000	3750000	And that game, Spelling Spree, which was being released
3750000	3753000	by Ubisoft is now known as Wordplay.
3753000	3756000	So I guess they thought Spelling Spree was retarded
3756000	3757000	as a name.
3757000	3759000	I would like to thank everyone in chat room
3759000	3761000	who was yelling at me over what Ice Shield 21 is.
3761000	3764000	You all watch far more Japanese import animation
3764000	3765000	than I do.
3765000	3766000	There you have it.
3766000	3769000	It's fucking football, don't ask.
3769000	3772000	My bad.
3772000	3774000	Yeah, Rob, you should know better.
3774000	3775000	Sorry, did you know what it was?
3775000	3777000	Did you say anything to try to correct me?
3777000	3780000	I know, I like seeing you flounder.
3780000	3781000	You're a bitch.
3781000	3783000	I know so.
3783000	3785000	Well, speaking of bitchy things,
3785000	3786000	you know, these things that are going to have
3786000	3788000	other companies bitching,
3788000	3793000	it has been speculated that the Wii is going to
3793000	3800000	outsell the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 through 2008.
3800000	3805000	The market research firm IDC has basically stated
3805000	3808000	that they believe the hardware shipments of the Wii
3808000	3811000	will capture more than a third of the worldwide market
3811000	3813000	by 2008.
3813000	3817000	And it will rise above the PS3 and Xbox 360.
3817000	3821000	In related news, I still don't give a shit what an analyst has to say.
3821000	3823000	I think it's already proving, though, to be that way.
3823000	3825000	Just, you know, look at how it's performing.
3825000	3826000	I'll give you that.
3826000	3828000	But I get so sick of these.
3828000	3830000	Analyst says this.
3830000	3832000	Stories making it to blogs.
3832000	3834000	That's why I'm not talking about any stories with analysts.
3834000	3836000	And it's catching a lot of news and what have you.
3836000	3837000	And you're right.
3837000	3839000	The whole reason I thought that it was relevant
3839000	3840000	is because it is happening.
3840000	3842000	It's something that we actually see happening.
3842000	3843000	I'll give you that.
3843000	3845000	Just like we had this week as well.
3845000	3847000	There was another analyst that said that the PlayStation 3
3847000	3849000	is going to take over by 2010.
3849000	3851000	Then there was another analyst that says the Wii is going to take over.
3851000	3853000	Then there was another analyst that says that the 360 is going to take over.
3853000	3855000	We need someone to analyze the analyst.
3855000	3856000	So you know what that means?
3856000	3858000	It's crap information.
3858000	3860000	Your guess is as good as their guess.
3860000	3862000	What do you think about this guess?
3862000	3865000	I mean, I actually kind of agree with it.
3865000	3869000	I do think the Wii will continue to outpace 360 and PlayStation 3
3869000	3873000	just based on the reactions of people I see who aren't gamers.
3873000	3878000	Again, keep in mind, Kars was one of the top selling games last year.
3878000	3881000	Not thanks to any hardcore gamer who reads the blogs
3881000	3884000	and thinks that that's the whole gaming world right there in that bubble.
3884000	3887000	The casual gamer is what's going to push the Wii, I believe,
3887000	3889000	ahead of those other two systems.
3889000	3891000	I don't think so.
3891000	3895000	I think the 360, there's going to be some great games coming out.
3895000	3897000	It's a little bit slow in the beginning of the year.
3897000	3900000	January, there's like Lost Planet coming out.
3900000	3904000	Or was it January? There's like two games for the 360.
3904000	3906000	Most people were still picking up the Wiis
3906000	3909000	because they couldn't get a hold of them at launch.
3909000	3913000	Right now, I think by the end of this year,
3913000	3916000	I still think the 360 is going to be beating the crap out of the Wii.
3916000	3919000	But I don't really hear people talking about Lost Planet anymore.
3919000	3922000	Yet I still hear people talking about Wii Sports.
3922000	3926000	Well, that's because people are simpletons and they like Wii Sports.
3926000	3927000	Big deal.
3927000	3930000	People are picking up Wii Play, not because of Wii Play,
3930000	3933000	but because it came with another controller.
3933000	3936000	Nintendo's just not putting out enough product.
3936000	3940000	I have a story here real quick that Nintendo is slow
3940000	3943000	to resupply retailers with brand new Wiis.
3943000	3945000	I can attest to that.
3945000	3951000	Distribution for the month of March is being cut out of their replenishment cycles.
3951000	3954000	Basically, Nintendo has said, guess what?
3954000	3957000	The distributors out there, you're not getting any new Wiis for the month of March.
3957000	3961000	We're giving them all to retailers because we can't make enough.
3961000	3965000	So they right now are having a problem with production,
3965000	3968000	and I think they just need to pump out as main systems,
3968000	3975000	but eventually it's going to plateau once all those people that were waiting to get one finally get one.
3975000	3980000	But right now, Super Paper Mario is coming out in April,
3980000	3986000	but there's not any real big games announced that have definite dates yet other than the fall.
3986000	3988000	So I think it's going to just plateau.
3988000	3992000	Yay, it's the DS drought all over again despite what Mr. Fils-Aime said previously.
3992000	3997000	Yeah, seriously, Mario Party's been delayed to whenever, at least summer.
3997000	4001000	And then there's really a lot of crappy games coming out.
4001000	4003000	But Zelda Ocarina of Time on Virtual Console.
4003000	4004000	Fap, fap, fap.
4004000	4006000	Oh goody, great.
4006000	4008000	That's awesome.
4008000	4012000	Virtual Console, totally the reason why you should buy a Wii.
4012000	4018000	It's kind of, you have to admit, for some, again, casual gamers, that kind of appeals to them.
4018000	4021000	Well great, but I don't think it's going to sell systems though.
4021000	4026000	I think really right now people saw WarioWare and it was a lot of fun,
4026000	4029000	and they're seeing some of the games coming out probably in March,
4029000	4034000	but there is going to be a drought, and I think that's going to plateau off.
4034000	4039000	If it's the 360, if they have as big of a month as they're planning to in May,
4039000	4041000	it's going to keep going.
4041000	4045000	And I think with Game Developer Conference there's going to be some major announcements.
4045000	4050000	And then eventually, especially with November, we're just going to see it take off again,
4050000	4052000	with Halo 3 especially.
4052000	4055000	So, I don't know.
4055000	4059000	Going back to both these topics here, Gaming Nerd in chat says,
4059000	4064000	by 2010, none of these consoles are going to be good since the next gen will be here,
4064000	4067000	and some console will get released a year before the rest.
4067000	4069000	Good point.
4069000	4074000	Let's see, also talking about JV Mon says, who the fuck cares about Ocarina?
4074000	4078000	Thank you very much, because I think Ocarina is one of the most overhyped games ever.
4078000	4081000	I like Ocarina of Time. It's one of my favorite games.
4081000	4083000	I like it. I like it.
4083000	4085000	It's one of my favorite games.
4085000	4088000	There are certain websites out there that review some of these Zelda games,
4088000	4092000	and because it's Zelda, they give it a 10 out of 10.
4092000	4097000	Not saying which websites, but I saw that and rolled my eyes and go,
4097000	4099000	well, I kind of figured you'd do this,
4099000	4103000	seeing as you've got a big heart on over fucking Twilight Princess,
4103000	4107000	which I might add, it's a great game, but it's not perfect.
4107000	4110000	I did have a heart on over Twilight Princess, actually.
4110000	4114000	It wasn't fucking the greatest thing on earth.
4114000	4116000	I've seen way better.
4116000	4120000	But actually, it was pretty good.
4120000	4125000	But anyway, no, I don't think, for me, Ocarina was no Link to the Past.
4125000	4126000	That was my problem.
4126000	4128000	Call me a 2D gamer, whatever, but that was my problem,
4128000	4130000	was Ocarina was no Link to the Past.
4130000	4132000	Exactly. So, whatever.
4132000	4135000	Controversial viewpoint, sorry, what can I say?
4135000	4139000	That's what we love to have here on this show, our controversial viewpoints.
4139000	4143000	What we also love on this show are other little bits of retro goodness,
4143000	4144000	and this always makes me squee,
4144000	4147000	and I notice Rice Princess is here joining us now,
4147000	4149000	so say hello to the fanboys and girls.
4149000	4150000	Rice Princess?
4150000	4152000	Hello.
4152000	4153000	How are you doing this week?
4153000	4154000	Kind of tired.
4154000	4155000	Sorry to hear that.
4155000	4157000	You want to nap on the ground there while we do the show?
4157000	4159000	No, it's filthy.
4159000	4160000	All right.
4160000	4162000	I don't know if you remember this game, Rice Princess,
4162000	4165000	but coming to the Wii from System 3,
4165000	4167000	we've talked about this previously on the show,
4167000	4173000	but we have some box art now for Impossible Mission coming out to the Wii,
4173000	4174000	and...
4174000	4176000	Are you freaking joking? This is awesome.
4176000	4177000	No, I'm not.
4177000	4180000	This is news that just makes you want to shout,
4180000	4183000	Ahhhhhhhhhhh.
4183000	4188000	It's more like, another visitor, stay a while, stay forever.
4188000	4189000	Nobody's going to get that.
4189000	4191000	Anyway, Impossible Mission, if you can believe it,
4191000	4193000	came out 25 years ago,
4193000	4196000	was one of the first games to use real synthesized speech,
4196000	4199000	such as the type that Rice Princess and I just performed for you guys.
4199000	4202000	Keep in mind, this is not Mission Impossible.
4202000	4205720	This was I guess you could call it a spoof game. There's some cool little screenshots there
4205720	4208360	These are from the DS version of the game, but look at that
4208360	4212940	It's like it's like what they did right with this is the same damn game. Just would like really pretty graphics
4213080	4216120	That's pretty cool, and it's also coming out on the PSP
4216120	4221880	You can see PSP DS and Wii so very curious to see what's gonna happen there also. What's new to this game
4221960	4223960	There is a new tutorial mode
4224080	4228720	There's also three game modes and three characters to choose from
4228720	4232880	The characters look to be the dude that was in the original game a chick now
4232880	4238320	Is that chick or a guy with long hair actually can't tell oh, no, it's a chick and a robot named gamma
4240240	4242240	What
4243240	4245240	What it is a robot
4245240	4247640	Anyway, the three game modes you can play new
4248460	4253340	Original and of course the hybrid mode the original game with the updated graphics swoon
4253340	4260100	Okay, so when you play the robot does he say get him my humans like that doesn't make sense. Why a robot what the hell?
4260660	4263460	Maybe it's like a Android or something
4263460	4268900	I don't know can't you still say get him my robots, and it's you know cuz what they did they shot out little electricity beams
4268900	4274260	And if you're made of metal, that's probably gonna hurt. I don't know that just seems a little bit shady to me
4274260	4276260	I don't know if I want this game anymore
4276740	4280980	You're gonna not buy this game based off the fact you could play as a robot
4280980	4288580	Yeah, and I could also just play it like on the Commodore 64 like it originally was but new game modes
4289220	4290420	so
4290420	4294900	All right, I'm totally buying it for the Wii. I'm looking forward to this game so much
4295060	4299580	Did they ever say if this is coming to the u.s.. For sure because I know this is coming to
4300660	4305660	Europe and I can see the box art has the Europe ratings on it, but did they ever say they confirm this for the u.s.
4305660	4311020	Oh, well, I know the same company is putting out elevator action, and that's coming to the u.s.. So we're probably it is
4311020	4315100	I hope so I hope so system 8 or whatever we should call them and get an interview
4315380	4318180	I'm gonna do that system 3 system 3 sorry
4318180	4320540	I don't know why I thought this is me system 3
4320540	4324740	I'm gonna call them try to get an interview and beg and plead for impossible mission like a sad little fanboy
4326660	4328660	Well
4328820	4333020	Speaking of a sad little fanboys, but nothing actually having to do with sad little fanboys
4333020	4337020	Um guess what is coming out to the Wii? Thanks to the Vendee?
4337580	4339580	we are getting Scarface and
4340340	4344820	Which is kind of funny because you know with the game that it being you're actually gonna be using
4345540	4353300	The nunchuck to walk to drive to walk around to pilot boats, and you shoot using the wiimote and
4354140	4358740	You even have a chainsaw for hand-to-hand combat, so you have to wiggle it around and all that
4358740	4364780	But um we're on the ps2 and Xbox ones you had to swear to increase your kill factor
4364860	4368140	You do it by making dirty gestures with your wiimote
4369020	4373520	The more you gesture the more your kill factor goes up hot sluts yes or no
4373520	4380100	I see nothing regarding hot sluts there are hot but the game good the guy will take place after the final

4619020	4622380	Fireboma says rocket broomstick racing sounds like quidditch, but worse
4623220	4627780	To which somebody else had a follow-up speaking of spoilers because you're talking about spoilers in the last one
4628660	4633960	GS68 had a comment for Dark Sakura GS68 has figured out who will die in book 7
4634380	4639580	Harry and Nintendo maniac 64 so he posted that spoiler there in chat, okay?

4653020	4654360	I don't know
4654360	4657020	Anyway, let's see what else was there
4657700	4660460	Fire Boma says rock and roll high school sounds like a porno
4661820	4666400	Solid goomba says hamsters are proof. God loves us now now the website
4666400	4670780	I agree to be fair the company data design interactive to be fair
4670780	4677020	They did put out earache extreme metal racing which apparently is a pretty cool game
4677020	4681140	I mean it mixes heavy metal with racing so these guys sound like
4681780	4689340	Modern-day genius says they know the types of games people want who doesn't want Ninja bread man. It's just I don't know
4690260	4693260	Please explain to me. How this could possibly be a bad thing
4693260	4696980	They're in the UK so I mean that's even better
4698300	4700300	Now Jamie's gonna want him to
4700660	4706300	We can talk no one can contact their projects director. The hamster thing just sounds dirty I
4707400	4710220	Want them on the show I will do whatever it takes
4711580	4713580	Anyhow um I?
4715620	4719340	Think this is interesting and this is one group that will not be playing
4719340	4724340	Any of these games on the Wii anytime soon? What's basically going on? Is that?
4725060	4726060	There's this
4726060	4733380	Christian group and they call themselves the porn talk which is backed by basically a faith-based ministry
4733900	4737940	They've started a website that basically says has this huge banner on it
4737940	4743140	And it says we have a porn problem porn safety facts for Nintendo's
4743140	4745460	Wii gaming console if you want to visit the site
4745460	4749620	it's the porn talk calm and actually I looked at the site earlier and
4751540	4757260	You know basically they're just trying to prevent children from seeing pornography like did you know that?
4757780	4762100	You know there could be pornography hidden away and all these things we need to keep kids away from porn
4762660	4768100	There could be porn in your Wii because the Wii has access to the internet therefore there is porn I
4768660	4773900	Would like to also point out to the geniuses behind the porn talk calm that the computers you use
4773900	4780300	That the computers you used to make the porn talk calm that you're urging your kids to go check out to keep them away from
4780300	4781260	Porn or what okay?
4781260	4783020	I guess they're really not doing that but you're urging
4783020	4788620	Parents to go check out to keep their kids away from porn that device can also be used to access porn
4788820	4795860	If your child has a cell phone that can be used to access or something funny to a dollar or what is it?
4796380	4800620	395 that can be used to access porn at your local
4800620	4804100	Is somebody fucking racing outside? That's why I don't like having the window open.
4804100	4805100	In your apartment complex.
4805100	4806860	Anyways, I gotta I gotta add this real quick. Yeah
4808380	4812820	Now imagine if you will they tell them yeah, go to that porn talk site
4812820	4816780	They'll teach you how to you know prevent you know seeing porn and stuff, okay?
4816780	4822160	They don't remember what the website name was so they search for porn talk boom porn there you go
4822860	4824860	they've been they've been uh
4824860	4831620	The porn beat them to the website, so I don't know they're bragging on their site that porn
4831620	4836100	Talk won best in show at the Addy Awards and all this. What the fuck's the Addy Award?
4836100	4842100	I don't know who cares. It's the award show where we invited just us and we won because we're awesome
4843380	4847180	We've been taking we've been talking about the Wii and Wi-Fi devices on the porn talk blog
4847180	4853420	We'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this issue and your suggestions on dealing with devices that come with internet capabilities
4853420	4857300	They should be banning PCs next then in a max, and you know
4858380	4861000	Your cell phone why don't you crawl into a cave?
4861780	4866780	I'm just looking at some interesting comments on the actual site itself. I figure there's these comments are posted publicly
4866780	4868780	There's no problem with me reading them on air correct
4869300	4872780	Ray said I'm all for talking to your kids about porn
4872780	4877860	But the porn talk calm goes a little overboard using filtering software on your 17 year old is a little outrageous
4878100	4882220	He or she will be in college the next year. Do you really want them so sheltered?
4882220	4887820	They'll go crazy not to mention the chances are your 17 year old will know a lot more about computers than you and will have
4887820	4894100	No problem getting any content. They want in related news. Ray is the olr not listener of the week
4899020	4901020	Common-sense people fucking use it
4903020	4909600	And you know there are ways to block the internet for your new children, I don't download the thing
4909600	4916040	There you go, but of course that would involve the parents being involved so
4917880	4920840	Yeah, that's not going to ever happen. That's never going to work
4920840	4928280	I mean come on gs68 makes an excellent point in chat gs68 over at chat dot orange launch radio com says women have boobs
4928740	4930740	Women are Gateway to porn
4930840	4936160	There you go. It's all women's fault. What do you think about that dark soccer? Oh, yes boobs
4936160	4939840	Oh, it's so all of our fault. You know and while they're at it
4939840	4945840	You know how about you know putting live birth on TV too because that you know that shows off the coochie
4946200	4950700	Or well don't they already have to show the miracle of life as part of like education and schools
4950880	4952120	Not if you live in Alabama
4952120	4957920	I was well that was a gateway to pornography the minute the minute I saw a baby flying out of that woman's vagina
4958000	4960640	I knew I never ever wanted to touch one
4960640	4965040	a health ed made you gay
4967920	4970000	Yeah, yeah sex education made me gay
4970000	4978120	I think I don't know anyway obviously stories about these you know crazy people who you know go oMG porn and have these you know
4978120	4997200	Hair trigger reaction to this kind of crap get us angry and when we get angry. It's time for our f us of the week
4997200	5003200	My F of the week goes towards people who say you're not so-and-so, so you don't know
5003200	5007480	Like you're not a parent. So you have no right to talk about children. Um
5008520	5015160	No, I'm intelligent. I have a brain. I'm observant. I've had little brothers as
5015840	5020400	A human being and as a woman who may one day give birth to children
5022720	5027040	Shiver not you just the baby flying out of your vagina I
5027040	5034920	Think that that completely discounts anything that you have to say when people start off with you don't know
5035080	5037080	Because you are not you know
5037280	5044040	That instantly removes all credibility from any argument that you might have by it because you're trying to immediately dismiss the other party
5044680	5049240	That doesn't put you in a superior position that puts you in a position of ignorance fucking shut your mouth
5050440	5052200	I'm done
5052200	5058760	Loki um, I guess f you the apartment complex for not actually having lines in the parking lot
5058760	5061560	So everyone has to kind of guess to where the cars are supposed to be
5062000	5066400	So that kind of sucks and have have you noticed that none of these blogs that point out, you know
5066400	5071600	The porn on the psp and porn on the we and stuff. Nobody's talking about the PlayStation 3
5072880	5075000	At all one owns a PlayStation 3
5075000	5081400	Exactly. So more porn for me and in high definition. So hell yeah
5082680	5090240	The Rob D in chat says I like how sky takes it sound like vaginas or rocket launchers in a way they kind of are
5092080	5093720	Right, Jamie
5093720	5094840	No
5094840	5096840	All right. Anyhow
5097120	5101800	My F you at the week goes to lack of sleep because I swear like every night this week
5101800	5105520	I got maybe four hours of sleep at the most of court granted. That's my own damn ball
5105520	5111200	I know it's the go to bed early Rob. Well, you know, there's Beth. There's there's such good TV on at 2 in the morning
5111200	5117320	What can I say? No, you know for circumstance, so I was just exhausted yesterday when Jamie and I were running around San Francisco yesterday
5117320	5119040	I was so tired. I thought I was gonna pass out
5119040	5124720	I slept for 11 hours last night, but I feel I feel pretty good today if a big groggy from oversleeping
5124920	5126920	so if you do lack of sleep and
5126920	5132120	And that's it rice princess left blank lanky style left
5132120	5136400	So we're the only ones in studio. So back to the gaming news then since there's no more F use of the week
5136960	5139240	Actually, I have one more F you of the week what I lied
5140440	5142920	Apparently, you know this fucking article. Okay?
5143480	5145000	alright, um
5145000	5150600	One of the major British driving schools BSM, which I immediately misread as BDSM
5151240	5154320	Took a survey. I misread it as BM and thought you
5154320	5159200	Took a survey of a thousand drivers between the ages of 16 to 24
5160680	5165560	About video games how it's affecting their driving habits and the results stated
5166360	5169560	27% admitted to taking more risks on the road after playing a racing game
5170720	5174160	And of course saying they pretend they're actually in a video game when they drive
5176240	5181400	They're saying that that's a an indisputable link between gaming and dangerous driving
5181400	5183400	Um
5183640	5187600	What they're not really paying attention to is that
5188200	5194680	If they're interviewing people between the ages of 16 and 24 chances are that your audience is not going to be very fucking mature
5195680	5197080	and
5197080	5200520	Not going to have the skill to know about you know
5201240	5203240	how to drive properly
5203240	5210920	It's you're dying to say something over there Loki they feel the mention is all those people that said they drive recklessly women
5212000	5218140	Of course then again. I mean I can't imagine too many of them actually twenty foot seven percent. Yeah, that sounds about right
5218680	5220680	I don't know
5221400	5225640	It doesn't matter anyways if even if they weren't playing video games. It's still be crashing this shit
5225640	5229680	I swear to God people talking on their cell phone drifting in and out of lanes Oh
5229680	5235820	Okay, the funniest thing happened to me today. I bought food. Oh my god
5236440	5243080	Meanwhile people are dying and just like totally oblivious to the fuck. How did I end up in this river?
5243640	5246960	They've totally jumped out in front of me. It's like I
5247720	5249720	think anything
5249760	5251760	that
5252040	5254040	Has an effect on
5254040	5258920	Your react like if you have a predisposition toward anger or
5259800	5263760	Nervousness you're that's what's gonna. I think more effect. How you drive
5264920	5267600	Not so much the game. I mean
5268160	5271620	That's just that's really I mean even when I was a new driver
5271920	5276440	You know playing hard driving didn't make me want to go out and do a loop the loop on the road
5276520	5280960	But then again hard driving you were driving super damn slow at least it felt slow in the game
5280960	5284760	It's not playing a driving video game that makes you want to drive fast
5284760	5289560	It's the fucking Wangan midnight maximum tune to soundtrack that makes me want to drive fast
5295240	5297360	Try and catch me now fucking coppers
5298760	5301840	exactly in the beat to be a little bit serious there I
5302920	5308680	Would think of anything playing video games would help you drive better because you're actually gonna have a faster reaction time
5308680	5315400	You know from games. They've actually helped you improve your reaction time a little bit. I would think so
5317560	5320500	Whatever it's a fucking survey survey suck
5321960	5323960	Survey says you say
5325200	5327440	So funny you shouldn't be playing
5328200	5333320	You know that kind of music, but uh Yuzo kashiro is gonna be DJing play
5335300	5337300	Actually the concert in June
5337300	5342280	They're going to be he's going to be DJing. I believe it's the concert in Japan. I know in
5343040	5345520	Singapore I better start driving to Singapore
5351080	5353400	Yes Rob drive to Singapore
5354480	5359400	Through the ocean that'll be awesome. I'll drive so fast. I'll float on the water come on
5360600	5363680	Right or maybe you'll just fart so hard you
5363680	5365680	Float over the water
5366160	5367520	But I thought that was pretty cool
5367520	5373360	And you know he's done such music from like you know streets of rage revenge of shinobi Actraiser
5373880	5375880	Castlevania portrait ruin
5376040	5378040	lots of stuff so
5378160	5383200	Gonna be spinning some tracks too bad. He's not coming over here. Just in Singapore ah
5383880	5389800	Bandit is my new best friend in chat if Sonic can do it. Why can't sky. Thank you very much
5389800	5395760	Sonic is a fictional blue hedgehog. I don't think hedgehogs move that fast anyways
5397220	5399220	You're just pokey I
5401040	5403040	Think it was irony or something
5403760	5407480	And hamster heroes is there a really is there a hamster that runs real fast
5407480	5411760	I think there's one that looks like Batman scary. Oh my god. This is the best game ever
5411760	5420040	Fucking hamsters have you ever had a hamster? Do you know I mean they in in grade school?
5420040	5422880	I just remember whenever like you go in the classroom that has a hamster
5422880	5426600	It smells like poop and they poop out pellets, which I always thought was amazing
5426600	5431720	Let me tell you a story about hamsters real quick. Hey hamsters are retarded. They're pretty real
5432120	5436840	The reason you would own a hamster is to watch how retarded it is I had a hamster
5436840	5443200	We named him Sam because it was squeaks and moves. That's you know basically what stood for that's so creative anyways
5443200	5445760	So the hamster would spend hours
5446920	5450800	Doing this it would climb up the side of cage climb upside down
5451320	5457840	Fallen's head climb upside and just keep doing that over and over and over again. Well. You know why the hamster was so crazy
5457840	5459840	Oh
5466400	5470760	I'll let the joke go now. Thank you anyways, but yeah one funny thing about hamsters
5470760	5474040	Oh, they actually throw their poop like footballs out of their cage
5474640	5476600	This is the Wii game
5476600	5482400	I want they sit there their feet fucking up in the air pull the poop out of their ass and they throw it
5482400	5489720	It is the weirdest thing to see but you guys don't understand why I'm laughing so hard
5490480	5492960	Because thank God, this is a TV
5493880	5496600	But Loki actually put his feet up in the air
5498720	5500720	And reached
5503280	5505800	Rob's all red in the face of a horrible oh
5506920	5510300	My god. We need a TV show just for moments like that. We do
5510300	5511620	we
5511620	5516900	Have a hamster on the TV show, but a cape on maybe that should be our new mascot is a hamster
5516900	5521700	They have a little bit about you too, so it's not worth it and every single one of them dies from cancer, so
5522660	5524660	not even worried
5524700	5529540	Not even worth it of course all the chat rooms shouting hamster dance hamster dance
5532660	5538680	This is something that will make you dance the news that Raiden 4 is coming to the Xbox 360
5538680	5546400	Also, we're getting a localized version of Raiden 3 on the PlayStation 2, and that's coming from UFO interactive
5547720	5555480	And let's see that's coming out for $30 and that by the way originally showed up in Japan in September of 2005
5555480	5558200	So it's like one of those hey, it's about freaking time. We got that over here
5558200	5560560	It was supposed to come out last year around August as well
5560560	5565280	But then company it's which company excess game dropped it so yeah, whatever anyhow
5565280	5570800	I should be noted though that Raiden 4 is coming out on Xbox 360 for those of you unfamiliar with the franchise
5571000	5575320	It's just one of those shooter games that you know a lot of people love so
5576120	5580560	There you go. I'm sure it's gonna be very pretty on the Xbox 360. I'm very excited about that
5580560	5586520	It is a it should be noted. It's a retail game not an Xbox Live arcade game, so that
5587400	5591340	Should tell you what you know they're going for here with that game should be fun
5591340	5597700	Well something that's not quite so fun. Though is that for everybody who is on the Metal Gear online?
5598220	5600220	All five of you. Hey
5600940	5604900	The the Metal Gear Solid 3 subsistence online servers
5605900	5610740	Is a going bye-bye it as of April 2nd. It will be gone
5612460	5614460	The community is not big enough
5614460	5622540	Community is not big enough now the user community for the game those who loyal to it are putting up internet petitions
5623700	5627740	To try to keep it up, but it's in the category of not fucking lightly
5629260	5630300	Sorry
5630300	5634340	Good luck if it works petitions don't usually magically fix everything
5634340	5639060	But I know that's got to suck to get the plug pulled music game fans got amplitudes plug pulled on them a couple
5639060	5644340	But but again an amplitude came out like five years ago, Metal Gear substance three subs
5644860	5649240	Subsistence I can ever buy your go. Yeah, it's not that old is in March subsistence
5649240	5652540	I got it subsistence yeah, and to be honest it
5652540	5657380	Just didn't sell that well and how many people use the online and this is what you get when you have you know fucking networks
5657380	5661380	That run by each individual company so one centralized network like live
5662020	5667700	People start pulling servers because why bother paying for a server that you know no one's playing on so
5667700	5669700	whatever
5669860	5675100	But anyways so speaking of games that I think people are not really playing Phantasy Star Universe
5675700	5678340	Oh, no, there's one girl on my friends list
5678340	5683340	That's always freaking playing Phantasy Star Universe that game has dropped down to 20 bucks now seriously
5683820	5689620	It's not a bad game because the single-player mode is kind of fun, and you know it's like I see the online mode
5689620	5695620	It's like a kind of free enhancement to it. It's not that bad. No, but it wasn't the magic didn't last long yeah
5695620	5701820	um well Phantasy Star Universe is getting an expansion of the it's called the ambition of illuminus and
5702380	5708180	There's going to be some pretty cool stuff as well. I think this has already come out in Japan
5708700	5711360	But they're going to be getting some new weapon types
5712140	5718060	including some photon whips and slicers new stages even a casino and
5718060	5724740	and um apparently the casino is run by penguin esque wrappies. Maybe I should go back to psu
5726500	5729480	That sounds neat. I like penguins. I like wrappies
5731220	5737820	Your wrappies no if you if you've done the wrappy holiday quest you will never like wrappies again
5738180	5743700	Which I believe is still going in the Phantasy star online or the old PSL
5743700	5749060	I believe the Christmas quest is still going on the Xbox one as it has been for the past not 360
5749060	5755980	But the rage it was going on blue burst for like six months. Yeah, seriously. Oh geez that's awesome
5755980	5758240	They're all oh crap. We still have that game
5758900	5763540	Hmm and for anyone who'd like to know I uh quit psu last week
5765700	5770020	Congratulations. Yeah, this that goes to show just what my opinion of psu is so
5770020	5775400	I've been playing world of warcraft, and I'm trying to get Jamie to join our
5776260	5780660	Excuse me our little guild. We've got going on Ravencrest, so I think I talked her into it
5780660	5783300	How about when I have time and when someone gets me burning crusade?
5784420	5786060	All right, how about we take a break?
